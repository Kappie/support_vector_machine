The sun'll come out  Tomorrow  Bet your bottom dollar  That tomorrow  There'll be sun!   Just thinkin' about  Tomorrow  Clears away the cobwebs,  And the sorrow  'Til there's none!   When I'm stuck with a day  That's gray,  And lonely,  I just stick out my chin  And Grin,  And Say,  Oh   The sun'll come out  Tomorrow  So ya gotta hang on  'til tomorrow  Come what may   Tomorrow!  Tomorrow!  I love ya  Tomorrow!  You're always  A day  A way!    (OST of Annie, "Tomorrow")   This post dedicated to 2 persons i love so much. I hope you both can smile happily soon. My prayers adn supports always be with you both.
