The Science exam was SO much easier than I expected. It was great.  Guess what? Jessie was just over today and Jackie had Marinda and Black over. -.-; They were acting evil, so Jessie and I locked them out when they went to my old school. Then when they got in Jackie was  SOOOOO SOO SO SO  p!$$ed. O.o But Jessie and I were doing my nails the whole time they tried to get in and so it was funny.  I got fake nails and dey're purdy. That's 'cause Jessie and I went to McDonald's and got other stuff at Meadowlark Mall after. I got a preety purse and lip gloss, and Jessie got eyeliner. I got a toy from my Happy Meal, it's so awesome.  I've got another Cities soccer game today! Hopefully I won't tie like we did last night. >.  So I've got to go because these nails are impairing my typing, it's din-din, and I have to get ready to the socc-air!
