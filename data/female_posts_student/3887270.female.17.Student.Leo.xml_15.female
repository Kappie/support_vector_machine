I SWEAR I WAS LITERALLY HAVING A HEART ATTACK! I WAS SO SCARED. seee, what happened was that i was online till around 11:45pm, and then got told to go to sleep, so, i went upstairs, and laid on my bed and closed my eyes, and almost fell asleep, but i had a little light on in my room..and i heard someone coming in my room, and i thought it was my mom, so i quickly shut the light off, but it turned out, it was my brother...  "yo Joanna, your "friend" is online"  "whaaaaaaaaaaat? right now?!"  "yeah, you wanna talk to him?"  this is the moment, jO jumps outta bed, out of her room, and runs downstairs to the basement where her brother sleeps. (good thing my dad was already in bed, and my mom was like brushing her teeth or something int he bathroom, they didn' thear me go downstairs) so i get down there (my brother has his own laptop) and started talking to Chris....then we came up with a plan you seee..to stay up all night together talking on msn...the latest we ever stayed up on there was 4am. so what i had to do was hide in my brother's room UNDER HIS DESK, in the dark, so if my mom came into his room, she wouldn't see me. cuz they already think i'm in my room sleeping.  we spent the whole night talking...not closing our eyes, cuz we shut them...they won't open again!! lol. and our hearts would beat so fast, cuz we're so scared for ourselves and each other. if we got caught...we're done for. =S so we spent the whole night talking, and i went back upstairs, at 8am, to my bed..very quietly so no one could hear me..and fell into my bed...and slept..for a total of about 4 hours..i'm going back to bed soon i assure you. hehe. it was SO worth it. nearing the middle of the night i was like talking drunkness...but by the time sunrise hit,...i was so hyper..    "i've never seen this side of you before." -chris  "you've beenwith me 15months, and you've never seen this side of me?! it's gotta be the tiredness, lol"-jO    seee chris, i've told you before...life's all about risks...!! if you ain't going to take risks...don't expect anything to happen. we practically risked our lives. !! lol, the way our parents are..yeah.i would say so. huh, funnie thing actually..we kinda got to know each other even better...despite the 15months...we even got to know how we are without sleep, at 4-8 am..in the morning. haha. i'm going to remember this memory for sure,       "my g/f is giving me girl tips"  NEVER ASK A GIRL HER SIZE  you're buying me CLOTHES!? LOL.  making dreams together then making them come true  PATTERNS!!  past g/f's and b/f's  completely ObLiVIOus  innie/inbetweenies  where's the whipped cream!?   that's all i can remember right now with the lack of sleep..some reason..it all felt like a dream..like it didn't even happen..like the times when you came over..they still feel like dreams too..  i was saving the convo, since i was on my brother's laptop, and put it on word..but at the last couple of minutes..i closed the window b4 i saved..cuz i was too concentrated in planning to how i'm going to get upstairs, and listening for my dad walking around....sorry chris=( oh well. we were talking randomness anyways. lol, the BEST randomness. key thing: at least we didn' tget caught...     "ileave when my dad opens the basement door to come down and go to the bathroom...he opens the door to freedom for me! LOL."    *i need sleep*   urlLink
