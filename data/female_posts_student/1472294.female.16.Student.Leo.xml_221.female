Nothing to discuss or talk about. Maybe I should have stayed at home to watch my ''Fa Wan Yi Ren'', my Zhou Chuan Xiong and ''Tian Lun''. Can you believed that I missed 3 shows and 2 of them are last episodes? Just for the sake for going to a stupid dinner... *Grrr* At least I got to watch the Saturday late night show on Channel 8. It was called ''A bite of your apple'' roughly translated from ''Ping Gou Yao Yi Kou'', starring Daniel Chan and Joey. Quite nice and sweet, like an apple. The story is very general and aimed at many people from all walks of life... Daniel and Joey actually were cyber friends but in real life, they are also friends who love each other but were too shy to confess... Haiz... If only I have such a cute and handsome cyber friend. Coz everytime I chat with somebody, it is always friends I know and for a very short time....   Sunday  Ooo... Sunday was better. I went to Expo for the Best Food 2003. I ate a lot and there were also many people... It was like so squeezy and cramped. And I thought I have offended one lady. Never blame her, it WAS very crowded... But I have fun.... ^_^    Monday. Today.  This morning, I went to the library and then proceeded to buy glow- in- the- dark snowflakes to decorate. Lazing in the house till now. I feel kind of uncomfortable writing here... There was a recent news report that youngsters nowadays are crazy about blogs and constantly updating them... I admit I was one of them initially. I was so excited coz this blog is finally your own and you can do whatever you want to do. Then I also realised that I was ''hooked''. So during the most important part of my school life, I tried to stop and went into Hiatus mode with only occasional times to vent my fustrations on something or just to fill up my time... Now I am kind of tired and bored to update here. Maybe I need time to adjust. :P I think I talk too much now, *urgh*, have to stop...
