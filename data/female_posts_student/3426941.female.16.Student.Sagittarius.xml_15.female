Ah, lazy summer days.  Ryan is on vacation with his family in Florida now, and won't be back till the eleventh. At least I'll be able to see him again.  I've actually been online a lot talking with some friends. In particular, Paul, Dani's boyfriend who is a really good guy. I wanted to talk to him because I care about her and wanted to make sure he was on the up and up. Dani has done more for me than she should ever have done, and she takes on a lot of shit from other people that she doesn't need. I am grateful to her and admire her well.  I've actually been rather moody too. I was at camp, which is going well, by the way, and we were watching scenes from different musicals. Of course there was a clip from Sunday in the Park With George, and of course I broke down in front of the whole class, completely embarrassing myself. I hate being so weak that I can't even look at a reminder of last year's camp that I cry spontaniously.  Other than that, I've been hanging out at my pool, talking with friends.  At camp, we get to prepare a song, something we have never performed before and want to sing. I, of course, am singing On My Own from Les Miserables. I've always wanted to perform that song,and am so happy that I finally will. I am the perfect Eponine, really. But, then again, I am also Cosette. Oh well. Perhaps everyone is a bundle of ironies and contradictions. Thats what makes humans so complicated I guess.  I miss Ryan. It's going to be even harder than I thought next year. Talking to one of my other Desmet friends, I was asked if I was coming back to do the musical. I started thinking about going there next year, looking around at that amazing theater, looking at the curtains, seeing the stage, the green room, the couch. The chair. The water bottle... I just can't. The memories are too strong, and it wouldn't do the musical well to have an overemotional chemically imbalanced girl onstage when all she can think about is who isn't there, thinking of the musical we aren't doing. It would destroy me.  It's finally sunny outside. Maybe its clearing up for me too. The rain lasted a long time. I love the rain. It was pretty, but now I'm glad the sun is out, because the flowers are so much happier looking and their petals are so much brighter with the rays of the sun on them.  My favorite flower, it is funny,  is actually a rather humble plant. I like red geraniums. They aren't very pretty,and they can get a bit mealy,but they give me some kind of an inward joy looking at them. They make me smile, as if, behind all of their ordinariness, they have some inner secret that we can only guess at.  Happy Fourth of July, everyone. Have good times  Adieu.
