Just your best friend.   Remember me? We played pirates together. Running, chasing, yelling “ARR!” with our newspaper hats on. We collapsed in the shade of that huge tree, it’s stagnation shielding us from a blazing sun. It held that old tree house, remember that? We spent hours and hours up there, spying on the neighbors, spending the night, sailing our ship. We built it together, you and I. Well, alright. We had a little help. But it’s got our names carved into it, in the corner across from the door, with the rope ladder.   I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the exception to the “Girls have cooties” rule. We used to hold hands, while we learned to skate and bike. I would coax you, always the exemplary friend. I’d watch you, watch out for you, as you tried things I wouldn’t dare until you had.  	I am the girl next door. Remember me? We started junior high school together. You shared all your fears with me, and we’d drown our sorrows in video games and a bag of chips and a two-liter of soda… Each. I censured your negative behavior, but my ephemeral lectures always just went straight over your head. And besides, I can never stay mad at you… you always pull those puppy dog eyes and I melt. Even now I still melt.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one you crammed for finals with. My didactic presence always guiding you through, helping you pass without a single glitch. We always opened our grade cards together, at the same moment. And we’d hug each other excitedly, and my heart would leap. It always felt fit to burst out of my chest!  It was always just platonic for you. I’m the girl next door, you’ve known me since we were in diapers.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one you started high school with, jumping up and down at freshman orientation, “IT’S FINALLY HERE!” we shouted together, before you ran off to find your guy friends and I was left alone. Mentally condoning your behavior, after all… it’s just a guy thing, isn’t it? Turning to look for someone, anyone, to latch on to so I wouldn’t be that pathetic girl who stood by herself at orientation.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I suffered through seemingly endless cycles: I like her Help me get her I love her Help me keep her I hate her Help me dump her Always ending with “Whew I’m glad that’s over! I’m off girls for good! Well, not you of course. No one fits me like you do!” Over and OVER and OVER until I was ready to SCREAM with the insanity of it all, dealing with your fastidious “it’s all about me” stage. I wanted to jump on your roof shouting “I’m right for you! See me as more than the girl next door!”  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one who was compliant, allowing you to use me, hoping you would mitigate the blows. You never did.  I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one you went to homecoming with because you couldn’t find a date. “Please come with me?” you begged. “I wouldn’t have fun with anyone else” you pleaded, with those puppy dog eyes until I was forced to give in. I bought a dress at the last minute, remember? I used up most of my savings. I was breathless in anticipation, hoping for one compliment, one word of extravagant praise, glowing when you handed me a corsage. “You look nice” you commented, casually. Because I’m still that girl. The one next door. With the jeans and the skateboard? One of the guys. 	 I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one you dropped sophomore year. You found that pretty cheerleader more your type, going to parties and football games, forgetting all we had. Your expedient nature overwhelming my profuse attempts to stop you, and my excuses did nothing. Worthless prosaic words that did nothing to divert your attention from her short skirt and overstuffed boobs. You didn’t ignore me at home, of course. We still fixed computers together, and every once and a while we star gazed. I’ll never forget those nights, sitting out on your patio with a bag of chips and a few sodas, watching for shooting stars. I saw one once, and you know what I wished for? I wished for me. For you. For us. I know that if you’d just give me a chance… just one chance. But I’m still just that girl next door.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? It was my voluntary tutoring that got you through AP Chemistry. Of course, I told you not to take the class in the first place, science has never been your strong suit. You’re that same kid that tried to tell me that wind blew because the people in Canada were blowing out their birthday candles too hard. And after we finished your homework you’d always ask me for advice, never managing to offer astute words of wisdom in return. I didn’t mind. You were talking to me, at least.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I rode in your limousine to prom, I went with a friend of yours, remember? You told me he was a great guy, and that if we went in a group we’d have a blast. You spent half the ride there making out with your cheerleader. I sat awkwardly with my hands in my lap staring at the floor because my date and I had nothing to talk about. He also dumped me as soon as we got there in search of some alcohol and someone cooler. You failed to warn me about that one, didn’t you…? Yes, yes you did. I was the one who ran off to find my female friends to hang out with, to rant to.  You never came to find me. Oh, I’m sorry. I remember now, when you came home the next morning you didn’t go home, you came to my house. You talked and laughed and replayed all your favorite moments from the night before. If I remember correctly you asked how my night was once, apologized for the bad tip, patted me on the back, and continued your own story. Oh well, you were excited, I guess. It’s understandable. Not pleasant, mind you, but a fact of life.  	And now we’re finally graduating. I won’t be that girl next door anymore. You’ll have to find a new person do dump upon, to play with, to get advice from. You’ll have to find someone new to give you your imagination, to laugh with, to cry with. You’ll have to find someone fresh to love you through all your faults, to shake her head at you while you fall down. Someone else to bring chicken soup to while she’s sick, to tickle when she’s sad. Someone else to sing to, just to make her laugh. Someone else. This was my confession. My release of what I’ve wanted to tell you for… oh, about forever and a day. This is pretty much goodbye, dear boy next door. I’m going away to college next year, and you are too. You know, you never even asked me where I was going? It may be a very long time before we run into each other again. I will have let you go by then.     Unless you have something that you need to tell me too.
