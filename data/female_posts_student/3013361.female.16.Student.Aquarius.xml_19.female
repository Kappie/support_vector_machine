One of my fave shows One Tree Hill does not have a single person larger than a size 5 on there. All the guys are muscle-y (word?) and have perfectly chiseled jawlines. Where are the fat people? Seriously, the show isn't very realistic but hey, it's still cheesy enough to maintain my attention. I'm beginning to think that the stars of my show took all the fat people and locked them in a dark cellar with no food and they won't let them out until their cellulite covered legs fit into size 5 jeans. The fat people are being held hostage with ho hos and twinkies just out of reach. They pant and drool as their flab is crapped out and their stretch marks fade. Please, for the love of god, release the fat people!
