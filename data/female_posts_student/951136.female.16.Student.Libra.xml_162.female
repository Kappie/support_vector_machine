First, last night i went out w. gordon and my parents. Saw an excellent movie that i really enjoyed ( Tom Cruise is a good actor). Then just sat and talked w. gordon and my parents. Which made me really happy! i'm not quite sure why, other than the obvious reasons, but last night i got home and was just elated and the last thing I wanted to do was go to bed. Second, I cleaned my room. And I mean overhaul. I put pictures up. Things that had been lying around. I vaccuumed. I organized my shevles late last night around 1... And i love it now. I liked my room before. but now its  perfect  ( except for those two unpainted walls...) Third, OUR AIR CONDITIONING IS FINALLY FIXED AFTER THREE MONTHS!!!!!!!...enough said. Fourth, I just bought two new pairs of shoes. And i  Know  it is sooo cliched, but shoes are so much fun you guys!! i love them! I got a pair of red All Star, down side, all i wanted was a white pair, but NNooo one has then. that dampered my happiness for a while. BUT THEN. i bought a pair of pink pointed toe mules. oh man. oh man. So nice. i cant wait to wear them oh man! I know i'm not shoe obsessed. You guys know me. you know i'm not a shopping freak... but shoes are so much fun... ok and now i have to go EAT LUNCH and head off to band. ok, boi !     : )
