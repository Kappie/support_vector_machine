Here it is:   Me: I didn't do anything today. =P  Her: As usual, I did. I went to this candy fair.  Me: Gross.  Her: You loser, you're just jealous because I actually did something. =P Unlike you.   Yeah, I'm so jealous of you because you go to uninteresting places and eat candy. I like candy, but I wouldn't like to go to a candy fair. Completely boring. Why would I envy someone else's life? I like my life... my computer life. Just because I don't go to places doesn't mean I'm bored. Haha, I'm jealous of you because you go outside while I stay here on this fuggin' seat cracking up, making some stupid but yet funny jokes with Mike Stag and visiting my favorite websites. Oh yes, jealousy is in the air.   But anyways, enough of that. My mom made me clean the carpet of our room with sponges because two aunts from Mexico are coming over and stay in our apartment until Monday. I never thought the carpet was  that  dirty. Darn, my hands are aching and they burn a little bit now, not to mention they smell like bleach. >_  I'm so excited to see my aunts... One of them I haven't seen in about 4 years. Tomorrow I'm gonna go shopping with them, which is kind of weird because I rarely go outside, much less go shopping. Ew. XP I've been wasting the whole summer doing a whole lot of nothing. I haven't even bought the book I'm supposed to read for Pre-Ap English: When the Legends Die. Sally says that's it's a fuggin' boring book, and that it takes place like in 1940 or something like that. Dang it, why couldn't they have assigned us a good book like the one last summer? And Then There Were None was a kick arse book. The first chapter is confusing, but then it gets better. Like Sally said, the reason why many people dislike reading is because the teachers assign boring books.   But apart from cleaning my apartment, that's all I've done today. I never do anything and it's great. Haha, my life is just wake up, eat, computer, eat, computer, TV, games, computer and goes on. See a pattern here? My life's so interesting. I should write a book about it.   [sarcasm]Keep those forwards coming.[/sarcasm]
