We were correcting the test of the person sitted in front of us, and the girl (who goes to my school and is one year younger than me) technically failed - she got 21 mistakes, when the maximum is usually 12 (it's okay if you go over, depending on how much you got on the sign test). Yah, I made her pass - I mean, she's a really nice girl, and she was paying attention in class (I also know I would hate it if someone made me fail). Of course, she had lots of mistakes, so I hesitated... but I say, the course is expensive, and all that. Anyway, my mom just went to the mail, and I got my G1 card! Now, I'm the only person in my call who hasn't driven... ever.  I feel special, in a bad way.  -.-  I find it ironic that with my driver's license, they also sent an organ donor card. -o- Although, I do want to donate my organs when I die... And I'll give blood when I'm the legal age to (I think it's 17 or 18). My friend has 0 type blood, but she doesn't want to donate because 'she doesn't like shots'. Neither does my mom (she donates every time she can), and I shake whenever I see the needle. Not liking shots is not an excuse - if you could safe someone's life by getting a shot, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you want others to give their blood in case you need it, especially if it's a rare type? Hn.  I'll go eat or something now. >.> (Just talking about shots makes me dizzy. -_- )
