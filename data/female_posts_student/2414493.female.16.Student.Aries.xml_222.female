Some worked, which you notice. Some didn't. Of course, I prefer to hide those from you.  I wonder where Mom put my AP bio book.  I almost fell asleep during the Spanish AP today. Wiggling the feet helped. So did touching the sunburn so that the pain would jolt me back into reality. Didn't get that solid feeling like I did Monday. But it's over. Shall I lament some more?  I have to find some time to do math homework. I'm not too excited, though.
