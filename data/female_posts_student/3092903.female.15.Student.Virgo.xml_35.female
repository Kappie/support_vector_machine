I got up about 1:27 this afternoon and sat in living room and read some of my summer work while I had my favorite food in the world peanut butter and pretzels. Then I went out and jogged for a little while and came back in and took my amazing little shower and now I'm sitting here in a towel being dumb. Eventful, right? Sara just called me, and she wants to do something tonight. I think we might go see Anchorman or something. But tts the only money I can spend this week, because I really need to buy some more new pants. Some that make my ass look really good. Maybe if I dont go to my grandma's anytime soon I'll lose a few more pounds. Three people commented on me losing more weight this summer at the show last weekend. I didnt even realize I had. I saw Brooke and Rynders a couple of weeks when i visited First Baptist and they said I looked smaller, so I think I may actually try to lose a little more if I've lost some without trying. I miss seeing everybody at school. Actually, I just miss goofing around in class  making people laugh. its like I'ma different person in the summer. I've never been able to be myself around all the drama people, and when I did for like ONE WEEK this summer, a couple of my "friends" got all pissed and said all of this shit about me. So since then, I havent been being holding back from being crazy, fun Erin because they give me those snotty ass faces that make me want to ram a fucking stick up their ass. hehehehe, but now i feel its time I moved on since I dont give a shit what they think anymore and since they've moved on to criticize my two best friends  what they're doing..I'm just sick of all this 8th grade shit. Girls will always be fucking retarded, I mean, I know I'm fucking retarded and I just try not to be, but I dont understand these girls that tell you your doing something wrong when they're jealous and then they go off being hypocritical and doing the same thing and think you dont notice. I just shake my head and laugh, because it'll bite them in the ass later (or that stick I have ready will bite them, either way). But anyway, that was all pointless and uninteresting to you since you probably have no idea what i'm talking about. Then again, most of the time no one really knows what I'm talking about. Well, I guess I'm going to wait around until Sara calls me back and tells me what we're doing tonight. I hope its something SCANDALICIOUS like i've been wanting, yum.
