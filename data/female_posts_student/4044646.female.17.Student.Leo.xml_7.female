I did go to Walgreens to buy a sun visor for my truck which ive been looking for this whole summer... then went and bought some tea from Chicken Express.... that was my great outing for the day... now i get to look forward to waking up and going to summer band tomorrow morning...  grr this weeked sucked ass...
