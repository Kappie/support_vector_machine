After being pubLished and seLLing miLLions, he goes back home and everybody in town but one hates and waNNa kiLL him. i beLieve in writing whatever u feeL Like; doNt kiLL d spirit...leave that to the pubLisher.   daf, iLL ask mah choir friends. i used to be part of a fLip choir, but i doNt remeber that song. iLL stiLL try for you though.   i might go see aaLiyah's movie tonite...iLL give u an update. semi-biGG recommendation for "John Q." not the tear-jearker i expected, but hmo horrors wiLL jump from the screen.
