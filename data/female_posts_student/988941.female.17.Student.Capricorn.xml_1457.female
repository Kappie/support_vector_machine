That was actually me pointing out that you don't need to remind people to blog, thats what I do. Yes people have exams but I'm still trying to get people to blog at least once a week so really Dave, there is no need for you too. And I am deeply deeply troubled and sorry that I asked to chill out I mean how could I possibly have taken those posts the wrong way? I mean the fact that what you both wrote seemed to me, a innocent bystander, very sarcastic and a bit bitchy was completely my fault and I shall never never do it again. Oh dear, the consequences of my words of trying to calm you down when you did seem rather annoyed. Bad Nicki for trying to sort out nedativeness on the blog. Bad Nicki. How dare you! If you like I can demonstrate me attacking you, here we go:   First of all , you can not attack  me  for asking people to calm down when there is clearlya small upset weather or not you were joking. How the fuck am I supoosed to know that? I quote: It seems to me that the only time in which you blog, is to contradict, or genrally attack what someone else has said. -  6/10/2004 10:51:28 PM. That sounds like you are being bitchy and I care what the fuck you think about that because everyone is bitchy sometimes yes like me being bitchy and fucking pissed off right now. Ooo great start to the day huh? Thanks.   Secondly , I was only telling you to fucking relax because you got all annoyed and at this time most people need to relax anyway but bad Nicki for trying to her mates to calm down and feel better. I'll never do it again.   Thirdly , You and Tom don't clash? Fine. Fair enough. I'm not actually bothered but in that case if you are joking around together make it more clear or just don't jokily insult each other that way dumbass people like me won't get confused and try to help sort it out. Gosh I still can't believe, I was simply trying to help you out. Never again.   Fourthly , shut the fuck up about my spelling no one spells perfectly all the bloody time and usually if your writing things in a rush not everything is spelt right. Ooo how dare I say that, I bet your spelling is perfect allllll the time. And anyway don't start on all that jazz until you can blog perfectly, ie: using an I instead of i.   And Finally , I am bitchy and probably always will be.  Now I didn't have a problem with you and I don't want you to leave. I was simply trying to sort your little what appeared to me to be a tiff out so that it did not escalate into pages like this and getting people all wound up for nothing. For maybe next time instead of you being so public about attacking me you should talk to me.  Have a nice day.  Back to normal blogging.  I had begun my day quite happily. Felt fufiled by my breakfast and then I came on here to check email and whatnot to find I was being attacked as people like to put it and so now my happy mood has drastically gone downhill. Great. Have a nice day everyone.  And yes I know I could've simply either said sorry or just not replied at all but hey I'm childish and was under the impression that it was my blog to start off with and that you knwo kinda said I could try and stop people from arguing. Oh how disillusioned I am.
