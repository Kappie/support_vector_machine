Ladies and Gentlemen, prepare your selfs for another summer of complete and utter rubbish.  I'm sorry, but the first time was quite interesting. It was new, it was a bit of a laugh, it was okay - but this is getting silly. Please, not another summer of strange freaks in a house trying to prove them selves to be somebody they are not. It ain't good TV anymore. What is good TV? Well the new channel BBC Three is sounding quite a good idea. Fat Boy Slim is having his own programme, should be very good. BBC Three's indents are made up of this strange creature called Blob (the guy on the left) - it's a bit odd, but if you want to watch the indents, there are  urlLink available here . Clip 3 is a bit dareing, and the BBC will probably get lots of complaints, but never mind. Anyway, if you are interested, BBC Three launches on Sunday 7th February 2003 at 7pm.  Unfortunatly nothing exciting is happening to my life, it just seems to be everybody else with the "fun" (as they call it). So I really haven't got anything to say, I might as well live in a ditch. However, we do have something to keep us going...   four day weekend!   but I am washing cars for money to go to Brazil! So it's all good really.  Jo, you asked me about the different sized text? I have made you all a little guide to explain size etc  urlLink here . Any other questions, just ask!  G'night peeps!
