I remember the days when Katie still lived here, and we would spend late nights with out butterfly nets having competitions to see how many fire flies we could catch. Or when Kari Mom and I would go sit on the porch and watch the sun set while the little yellow flickers start to come out. Those were the really good days. Curtis Avenue, Conneaut, and Katie. Probably the best times. I remember the one time I stayed up till 5:30 in the morning at Jenn's birthday party to wake everyone up so we could watch the sun rise, only to fall asleep minutes before it came up. Lol, we had so much sugar that night, and you know we played all those silly games like truth or dare where the main question was "who do you have a crush on?" only to be followed by a squeal of giggles. Yeah, those were the good times. The best part is though, they're not over yet. I still have so much time and so many great friends, more than I realize. More than I appriciate, I'm sure. Well you know what I say?  Let the good times roll :-D
