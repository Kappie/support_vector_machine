(Woohoo) I have Dinner Dance on Sunday. Anyone can go if they want to. It's at the Hulbert House in Boonville at 5 o'clock. I think I have a solo that I've only played once. It's My Heart Will Go On. "I'll never let go Jack, I'll never let go (as she lets go-what a lieing whore-if you say you'll never let go then you shouldn't!)."  I have senioritis so badly already. I can't wait until this summer and all of next year. It's just going to be one big party! I'm hoping I can get a car by August. I have $1,300 saved in the bank for a car and I'll be working this summer and should get about $400 (?) more. Maybe I could buy a used Mini Cooper. That would be the shit!  So right now I'm talking to Gavin and Jon and listening to all the music on my computer.  Listening to: [A Favor House Atlantic by Coheed and Cambria] (lyrics already on here)
