He gets really good deals on cars that barely have anything wrong with them, he fixes them, and then he sells them. He bought the WRX for something like 10,000 dollars. It needed a little body work so he got it done and now the thing looks perfect. Dad offered me 50 bucks to detail the car, of course I said yes! Then he went and asked Daniel to do it instead and he is giving him 100 bucks! Plus he gets to drive it. Sometimes I just don't get dad. Daniel would have done it for free because he would just want to drive it, but now he's getting paid. Oh well. It is so hot outside I just want to swim all day long. But I need to work. Writing right now is just an excuse for me to break. Maybe I'll go jump in the lake too. Dad's shop owes me 250 dollars. By the end of the day, that'll be 375 dollars. And dad himself owes me 30 dollars. Money money money.
