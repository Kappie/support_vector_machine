It was short and I did take most of the time in each section but the questions were much easier.  The SAT is very wordy and also very biased.  Also, on the SAT, I always had the tendency to answer the question from a conservative POV but the I realized the author is liberal and went with the liberal interpretation of a passage.  ACT had very little bias in my opinion(or at least a conservative one) and it was a lot more in the language of the common people.  I mean here and there a question would try to trip me up but if I read the question it wasn't that hard.  Math was a bit different.  I forgot a calculator so I had to do all the work the long way so I just guessed on the last ten when I only had a minute left.  I definitely "spanked the ACT" though.  I can't wait to get my score.
