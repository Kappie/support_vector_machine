"Why, naturally not, mother," replied I.  As she entered the kitchen, my mother was assaulted by airborn roaches. She ran for the macaroni, and, as she dashed to the fridge, was struck viciously in the head by one of the infernal beasts, which then dropped into the bowl of macaroni and scampered away with a handful of noodles.  We drew up schematics for a catch-and-release program involving little mesh traps and an ebay account, but, in the end, decided that today we would just buy roach motels. The big ones, the size of shoe boxes. Then we'll see who's boss around here.
