Lovely day today - I got to play pool! And I *beat* Sedgie!!! . . .well, only *really* once, but *still*.  And my train had *issues* and some door down the line wouldn't close so we stayed at every stop like three times as long as we should've and I *got* to Mount Kisco after five.  *shakes head*  Evil.  Then exhaustion kicked in as soon as I got to work so I found myself wandering in a slow sort of haze and yawning a lot.  And Soheil learned I was in high school (figures they only wanna know when they're about to hit on you, bastards) so that should solve *that* one.  *big grin*  Uhhhh, pre-school meeting?  Heehee - little park, as per usual? Or will it be overrun with small/large ghetto children?  Dollface - maybe we get points as we *start* Fatality, and get like a big bonus at the end of the game when we win? ^_~    I had withdrawn in forest, and my song Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway; And to the forest edge you came one day (This was my dream) and looked and pondered long, But did not enter, though the wish was strong: you shook your pensive head as who should say, 'I dare not--to far in his footsteps stray- He must seek me would he undo the wrong.'   -A Dream Pang, Robert Frost   Because Frost kicks some serious ass. ^_~
