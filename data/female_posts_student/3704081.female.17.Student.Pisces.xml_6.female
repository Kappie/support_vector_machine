It's nice to catch up with people, even though you haven't heard from them in a week. I like to hear about everybody else's summer, it might give me some ideas for when I'm bored and broke. I went golfing today, shot pretty well, had a few screw ups, but some good recoveries. I was watching the golf channel this morning with my dad and I learned something about my putter, which helped me with long putts and from the fringe. It turns out, mine's balanced differently, so I'm supposed to center the ball on the heel rather than the center. I  still shot in the 80s, so I'm a happy camper . Jeremy beat me though. By 9 strokes today. It was only 4 last week.  Grr.   Last night after work, Jeremy, Christine and I were on the hunt for ice cream. We went to Mickey D's, where the building just got redone, so the inside is trying to look like a diner,  with driftwood by the ketchup ... Anyway, we all got our ice cream and left. But  you should know that Christine has a lead foot.  And a Mustang. She goes flying out of the parking lot onto the highway, forgetting there's a median... "Now why the hell didn't you tell me there was a M-F-ing median there?!?" That was hysterical. No damage done though.  Thankfully.
