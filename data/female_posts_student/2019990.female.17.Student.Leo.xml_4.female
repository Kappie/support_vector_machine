Let's see what has happened.  Well we started the new semester today.  that's always  exciting.  I like my classes.  They're just as good as last semester if not better.  And I don't have a complete stoner math group.  One guy actually knows what he is doing!  It's awesome!   I just got off the phone with one of my camp "friends".  I really need to start being meaner, then these people wouldn't latch on to me.  Every year this happens.  Maybe they have meanness classes at the U of M, they do teach everything else.  Well, I ran out of steam.  That's all for now.
