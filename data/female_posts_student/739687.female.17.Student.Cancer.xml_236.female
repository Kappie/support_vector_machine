And I can't figure out whether I think too much or I just don't think enough.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I am ordinary.  I am typical. People don't have to prove themselves to me, I don't care. And I don't feel the need to prove myself to  anyone.  People don't have to be extraordinary to see eye to eye with me. I can see eye to eye with most people. You don't have to be on some godly level to measure up...please don't try to be on that level. I'm not, I'm nowhere near, and I never will be. And that's fine. I have expectations for myself, but those expectations aren't to be the smartest or the prettiest or the richest or the greatest at anything. I don't want to be outstanding; I don't want to be amazing. I don't think I could be if I tried. My expectations are high, but they don't revolve around proving anything to anyone. I don't need to feel competitive with anyone. I don't want to fight with the world to prove myself in any way. I don't want to be spectacular. I don't care if the people around me are extraordinary either. Extraordinary has nothing to do with being beautiful or intellectual or successful, but extraordinary has become that. So I don't care about extraordinary. I'm fine with typical. Typical makes me happy, and happiness is the only thing I care about in this world. If I'm happy, I mean, If I'm completely happy, then I've met every expectation on my list. Call me an under-achiever, I'd call myself an over-achiever.  So while the world is out there trying to be "beautiful" and "intellectual" and "successful", I'll just sit back and try to be happy. While the world is modeling their looks,  throwing their heads into books, working to get into 'top 5' colleges, trying to make it into a high paying proffession...I'll be meeting my goals. And by the time the world gets as far as their goals can take them, and when they seem on top of the world, I'll be happy. And my, how puzzled they may be, as I smile back at them as they bask in their success. Because I'll never see the world on a different level. The world will never outrun me. As long as I am happy, no one will ever be too far out or reach. No matter how extraordinary the world becomes, I will stay typical. I will stay ordinary.  But I'm content with ordinary.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Well, I suppose I've just gone and run off with myself.  Go on; be extraordinary, crazies. I'll see ya later.
