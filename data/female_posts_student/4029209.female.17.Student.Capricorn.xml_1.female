It was earlier but i had to move it back because i wasn't as good i thought i was (i know - i'm shocked too :P).   If i pass, i hope to buy a car soon afterwards. Buying the car, isnt the problem, it's the insurance. Have you seen how much it costs for a 17 year old girl?? its outrageous! i've had quotes starting from £1,000 all the way up to £2,500!!. I mean whos gonna pay that much?.  Apparently the reason its so high is because of out 'age group' when really its cos male charvs drive their cars so fast, they crash making insurance companies but the premiums sky-high. This is really unfair, cos i know loads of women drives (most of my mates) who are brilliant drivers and are never likely to crash.  But i guess till we grow older theres nothing we can do except pay out, i guess if we ever crash we'll be glad of it lol.Anyway, thats my rant for today. Thought i'd write it down since i've spent most of the morning being told i'm an 'undesirable candidate for insurance' lol.  Write soon :)
