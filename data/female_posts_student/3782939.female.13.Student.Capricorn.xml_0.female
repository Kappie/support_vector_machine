We hope we got some ghostly pics, but, unfortunately, we will not know until the film is developed. :(   Not only did we visit pretty much  every  section of the enormous graveyard, we also got to work in the library at our old elementary school before we went ghost huntin', and we got to eat at McDonald's, and, after we left the cemetery, we went to Dairy Queen to have marshmellow-flavored malts, which were  delicious!    Well, anyway, overall, it was a pretty fun day, and at the library we read X-Men comics that Cassie brought, so we weren't bored! :)  I'll be writing again soon, and I'll probably soon have more info on the ghost pics, so if you're interested, you'll be glad to know this!   If you have any information on ghosts that isn't on castleofspirits.com, and there for I probably won't know it, then  please  feel free to contact me! Check out my profile to find out how! ;) And remember... NON-BELIEVERS GO FIRST!!! MUAHAHA!!!!!
