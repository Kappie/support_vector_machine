And insecure because she didn't think I loved her... when in truth, She just didn't see how. I did. And do. So there. Now I have to remember the poem again. Blah! Stupid Blog!     You and Me  No matter what happens in life Or where our paths should lead us... No matter if we live till we're ninety Or if sharks come tomorrow and eat us.  No matter if I work second shift Or if you have two jobs. No matter if we're getting along Or if, sometimes, we're at odds.  No matter if we go off to school Or you move far away. No matter if you think I'm cool My mom does anyway.  No matter if you go work in Nevada And catch a skeevy rash. No matter if I lose my job And become trailer trash.  It doesn't matter, on a given day, Which one of us is hotter. And it doesn't matter if I end up gay And you turn out to be not...ter.  No matter who I'm dating Or who you choose to see. No matter if I'm mad at you Or if you're mad at me.  No matter if you hold a grudge Or I turn my shoulder cold. No matter if we can see our faults Or if, sometimes, we need to be told.  No matter what life throws at us Or who we grow to be... We'll always be what we are now, Simply You and Me.  I assumed, my Friend, that you knew this already, But it will do you good to hear it... You will never walk this Earth alone, So don't you ever fear it.
