I am the sun, you are my rays,   helping me to shine and to be all that I can.   I am a lake, you are my water,   filling me with ideas, dreams, and hopes for the future.   I am a tree, you are my leaves,   sharing who and what I am   and becoming an important part of my life.   I am a heart, you are my beat,   beating rhythmically to my happiness,   my fear, my sadness, my excitement.   I am me and you are with me,   to share all that I am,   to share life, love, and happiness.   Always.   - Bernice Ellrick -
