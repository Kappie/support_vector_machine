Between our recent visits to the Allerton conference and conversations with our students about technology, Jody and I have been thinking about this issue a lot lately.    So here are the things I find useful about Moran's piece:   He begins with a historical overview of technology in writing classrooms, and in a few brief sentences he links historical movements of technology with theoretical movements in composition: "In the early 1980s, the 'age of the microcomputer,' technology seemed to support invention, writing, and revising, activities that defined process-based pedagogies.  At the same time, however, this same technology supported microcomputer-based skill-and-drill exercises, which grew from the print-based workbooks that were a staple of the current-traditional curriculum.  In the early 1990s, when local area networks and the Internet began to become more readily available, these new manifestations of computer-based technology supported a social, constructivist pedagogy.  Today, as the Web captures our imaginations, we find that composing in hypermedia and adding graphics and sound to our writing seem increasingly appropriate activities in our writing courses, and as our students gain access to the Web, the research paper returns to the center of our consciousness, though perhaps in new forms" (Moran 203).    This historical-technological-theoretical link raises a kind of chicken-and-egg question -- did the theoretical movements of the times (process, social constructivism, multimedia and multimodal) drive the uses of technology?  Did technological innovations not specifically designed for the classroom (but certainly being taken up in that way) drive the theoretical and pedagogical movements?  Of course, I don't think the two can be separated, but the thought is fascinating.  He lays out the kinds of responses people/scholars have made to technology and writing instruction: prophets of doom (technology is the end of civilization as we know it), evangelist expressivists (technology is inherently democratic and will release creativity and empower individuals), and then (his own) more pragmatic view: "Computers have altered our landscape.  They have changed the medium in which some fraction of our students read and write.  Therefore we, as writing teachers, need to pay attention to what is happening.  On the basis of this knowledge, we will be able to make informed decisions about our use of technology in our teaching" (Moran 204).  Aha!   This  is what has been bugging me about ISU's approach to technology (using them only as a representative example -- they're not the only ones I've heard say this).  Computers don't magically make things better -- nothing does.  And they don't universally ruin things, either (although ISU would NEVER make that argument).  But they are a reality that we need to acknowledge and deal with, and there are as many productive ways to do that as there are teachers in the field.  Not everyone needs to always teach with a computer for each student in the classroom -- there are multiple other ways of productively dealing with technology, ways of thinking about it and having students think about it.  On the use of computers in the classroom: "The PC-filled room, though it may be with us in some places for some time, is a stage in our evolution as writing teachers.  When and if most of our students have access to computers in dormitory rooms or home settings, the computer-equipped classroom will seem much less necessary than it now does to writing programs" (Moran 206).  ISU would disagree, I think, given what's-her-face's shock at being asked if she  really *needs* computers to teach writing.  Even if students all own their own  computers, she would fight for computers in the classroom, because in order to  write during class time, you need computers.  But what Moran is arguing, that if  students have access, we don't need in-class compters, suggests that not  everyone sees the comp classroom as a place to write.  If computers aren't  necessary in the classroom once students have their own, then not everyone is  writing in the classroom.   I wonder if this argument upsets Hannah, if this feels like an attack on her teaching practices and use of computer classrooms (should be computer classroom - singular - since we only have one, but that's another matter).  It isn't meant to be that kind of an attack -- I think she'd agree that if her students all had universal access to good computers with the kind of software she needs them to have (PageMaker, etc), then she could spend class time doing other things besides working in class on the computers.    Interestingly, as a side note, the prejudice for PCs and not Macs in this piece is pretty impressively embedded and invisible.  And universal, I think.  Interesting.  Macs don't even exist as a viable option, as a meaningful choice, because apparently no one ever uses them.  Interesting.  He also has some interesting ideas about email and how it changes the nature of communication between teachers and students (levels of formality, etc), and also labor conditions.  He says, "The great boon, and the great evil, of computer-mediated communication is that it makes it possible for us to be available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, in effect putting in unpaid hours for our employers.  Offline, we have evolved strategies for limiting our availability: we post office hours when students can meet with us, and we have some way of screening our incoming telephone calls -- either a secretary/receptionist or a voice-mail system.  Online, until and unless we develop conventions that will protect us -- such as telling our students that we don't read our email on weekends -- we can be reached at all hours, Monday through Sunday" (Moran 211).    This is really interesting to me -- I never question how available I am to my students, and I don't see it as a bad thing.  Problematic, perhaps, but not bad.  They have my email, home phone, screen name...my students have about twelve different ways of getting ahold of me, and I don't want them to feel they can't contact me on the weekends.  We expect our students to work on the weekend, how can we not return the same commitment?  No one has EVER said that academia was a 9-5 job.  But the other reason this is interesting is that Jody and I are considering setting up IM office hours next semester to be even more available to students on a regular basis.  I wonder how Moran would respond to that.    I could go on, but those are the main things from Moran that could be useful in terms of thinking through ways to respond to people who ask Jody and I when we're going to take our course online and have our students work in hypermedia/new media/whatever the term of the moment is.  But the point is that web sites are ONE mode, ONE genre (yes, I could make the argument that web sites involve many genres, but you get my point).  Our point is to allow students the choice of MANY genres in order to achieve the goals they've set for a particular piece.  Yeah.  I'm done now.
