Both were pretty funny. this is a pretty inside joke, so most people like you won't get it:  "good job team" "LOL"  HAHAHAHAHAHA.. The second game was pretty funny, since our opponents didn't turn on ally chat, and so i had to suffer their n00b arguements. to all n00bs: J00 4r3 411 f4Gz !!! i 0WnZ J00 !!
