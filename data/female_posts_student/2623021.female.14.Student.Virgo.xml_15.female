We already have one in mind, he's a gay "accquantence". :O Something like that! I like it :P  Wow Mr. Johnson really got me into this free-writing thing.   I love it.  My blog is alot like my journal except my blog is easier to write in because I type way faster than I can write, plus I can multitask better.
