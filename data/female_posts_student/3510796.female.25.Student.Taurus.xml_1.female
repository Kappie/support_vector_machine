Well, my trip was long and exhausting, but an absolute blast.  Altogether, I put 1,100 miles on my poor Oldsmobile, and probably 10 pounds on my waistline from all that ballpark food.  Between Sunday and Monday, I plan on posting a sort of travelogue with stories and pics (I snapped over 200... jeez) from all of my stops.  And even though I was traveling by myself the whole time, I never felt alone.  You see, a few months back, a good friend of mine burned me a 3-disc bootleg of a Dave Matthews-Tim Reynolds concert from Purdue in '03.  I took it on the road with me, and it rocked me to sleep every night.  Gee, I wonder who could possibly be cool enough to give me something like that... hmm.  Anyway, there's no rest for the weary, as I'm headed back to work this afternoon.  And right after that, one of the peeps from work is throwing a party, so I'll be shuffling over there, with my party companion, the Green Fairy.  (You don't know the Green Fairy?  Oh, no no no... I'll address this situation later.)  And then... back to work at 8 in the morning!  Sheesh.  So yeah, there are things to see and stories to tell, and hopefully they'll all be up and around soon.  Also, I've noticed that we've yet to receive one comment on this blog.  I mean, I know it's only been up a week, but a little feedback sure would brighten things up.  Maybe if I start posting naked pictures of myself...
