But I haven't heard from here, so I don't know what the plan is. I wish I knew.  I might be spending part of the weekend in Saratoga up at my uncle's carriage house and maybe go into town or something, I was told I could bring a friend, but if I don't hear from her, I guess I could always find someone else.      I still miss the boat like hell, I had a dream where I had to climb the shrouds but pretty much fell...but I landed safely. I just remember we sang songs or something...I've had a couple of dreams about the Lettie...maybe one every night.
