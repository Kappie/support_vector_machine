Dennis was home by 4:00 on Thurdsay evening and we spent two hours up at Woody's, then took home supper and sat at home with Mike - a quiet evening at home. Then Friday, Jessi, Mike, Amber and I  (and of course, Dominic) spent the day at the mall. It was fun. Mike bought some school cloths. Then that evening they went to Jessi's and Dennis and I had the evening to ourselves. We sat up at Woody's again - I won $17 playing Ship Captian and Crew! The he took me to eat at Applebee's, and the to see I, Robot. He was so tired, though, he slept through the whole movie. But at least he didn't snore!      Saturday, though, he didn't have to work at all - first day off in about 6 weeks! We drove up to Lafayette and he got new glasses and we went to the Mall. He bought me an outfit to wear to Stacy and Eric's wedding next month. Then we came back into town, relaxed a while then went to Kevin and Ginny's for supper. It was so nice to spend some time with Dennis. It had been so long!     Mike is at his dad's until Thursday. The house is so quiet without him home.     I have a money problem - Aarons took out twice as much as they were supposed to from my checking account, causing me to overdraw. Now not only am I overdrawn by $87, I have no money for the week except the $3 and change I have in my pocket.  I am, of course, going to call them tomorrow and yell at someone and see if I can not get any resetitution, but I am not holding my breath. I really am not good at yelling at people!
