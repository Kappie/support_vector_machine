(and i'm not talking romance, i'm talking deep love that you don't find many places) and if ur not talking to someone great you're getting fed God's word down the throat by pat, and he's just great too! i mean, i can't think of very many places i'd rather be...ur sleeping on the ground, so sore you can barely walk, dirty all day and nite....SO MUCH FUN! lol the only thing was i kept thinking about how poor my faith has been lately...it seems i keep spiraling downwards more and more...it's not that i'm doing anything horrible it's just i haven't been diving into the word much and it's like, eventually you start to loose touch and u realize ur trying to find ur own answers and ur not looking to God to help you out...THATS where i go wrong, i'm totally selfish, i'm always looking for the answers w/in myself instead of asking God, and seriously, it's been months since i just sat down and read....that makes me so mad, and yet, i'll sit here on this computer for hours, not getting up and just doing it...i could so easily, it's right there... but i figure, there's always time to start...and rite now, i did... the Lord worx in misterious ways he does, it's like the second you go to find something, he shows it to you, right there, clear as day, exactly what you needed...thank you God!! changedfish
