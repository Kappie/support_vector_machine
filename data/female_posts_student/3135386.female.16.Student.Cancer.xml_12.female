It was an okay movie, the graphics (aka, Garfield) were amazing though! I'm not saying he looked real, but the way he interacted with other characters....wow. LOL, Lyndon found an empty bottle of wine under his seat....  We went out for pizza after that. The first was Chicken and Cheese. I though that was strange, chicken on pizza?? *laughs* That was until I saw the second pizza of course, chocolate and cheese. Now I see why Brasilians eat pizza with knifes and forks though....Man, it sounds disgusting, but that pizza was so good!!  Made plans for my birthday party, which is...uh, well today. Carlos is coming over and making me a birthday cake (wow, that's socool ofhim!)While Maju teaches me how to make Brigaderio (sp?) For all you in Canada, I'll makethem when I return. ^_^ Vito? and possibly Lyndon and a few other people are coming over at 7pm to have a little party thing and then at 11pm we're going to Mercena's Bar (a dance club) till, according to Maju, 5 or 6 in the morning...hehehe....('nough said)  -Hannah ps. Check out my photos of Brasil...well...soon I'm have more photos of Brasil...oh just check out my photos. And leave a comment if you please! ^_^
