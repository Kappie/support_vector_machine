Now, I know what you are going to say, "bunnyhugger, you can't wear those... you have no legs for those..." But I tell you now, you are WRONG! We must observe a moment of silence for the seriousness of this topic.      *crickets chirp*       I have bought HOOKER BOOTS! Yes. It is true. I have my first true pair of hooker boots. I did this on a whim, based on my earlier purchase of said miniskirt. I went to Target, and bought  urlLink these . Now, it was partially based on an earlier post from my good friend  urlLink libprincess , and partially because of my deep need, my deep urge to belong in the socially and fashion forward groups that pervade our college campuses nowadays. Yes. I have become a lemming.  I know what you are thinking. BunnyHugger, you have no calves, the boots will fall down to your skinny skinny ankles.  But this is not so. My friends, I have found a wonderful device. A helper in the land of those with helplessly skinny legs. SOCKS. Long,  GLORIOUS, BOOT SOCKS!!!  I know it may be difficult to comprehend, but I now have boots which stay up. On my  LEGS!  The utter joy I am experiencing is difficult to describe. I almost think it's better than sex.  The only thing that may help more is many nights of leg lifts. I don't know if Im up to that, so for now, I will worship the socks. And the boots. In fact, I'm wearing them right now. And I look pretty damn good, if I do say so myself.  No more nights of prancing around half-drunk in boots that wobble around my legs for me, no sir.
