I would type every detail of each day since my last entry like I did that one time, but it's been too long and I don't think I could remember enough.  It feels like much longer than a week since last I wrote.  But I will say this:  I've managed to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on two different occasions.  Once with assorted friends, and once with my mother, sister, uncle, my first cousin once removed and his wife.  Yeah, it's a lot better this time around.  Like, totally different feel.  This guy (Alfonso Cuaron) obviously isn't a hard-core fan, which means he's not afraid to leave out details and change the order of events to benefit the outcome of the movie.  Pretty risky really.  I mean, Jesus, no one wants to be hunted down by the Harry Potter nazis.  I thought he did a good job.  The only other movie I know of that he directed is Y Tú Mamá También, which is hardly similar to Harry Potter.  But yeah, this was just a better production, although perhaps it helps that this is also the best book of the first three.  Even the acting was better.  I was satisfied with it.  I also saw Super-Size Me at the Rialto.  Ugh, so much disgusting food.  It's pretty incredible how much weight this guy gained in a very short period of time.  The doctors were astounded.  Good documentary too. I'm kind of tired.  I really need to go to bed early tonight.  TAP starts tomorrow at 9.  I have been on the weirdest sleeping schedule lately, as in going to bed anytime between 3 and 5 in the morning and waking up at about 1 or 2.  It's crazy.  I actually managed to get up at 10:30 this morning.  So maybe I'll find sleep before 3 tonight.  I may take some Tylenol PM. Well, that's enough for now, I think.
