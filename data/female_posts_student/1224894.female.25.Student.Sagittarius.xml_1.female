I don't know if the song Somebody was meant for me, if it was, i want to say thanks for remembering, and if not, still i want to say thanks, at least it was a favorite. And i wish you all goodluck on this new career, new band and hope you have fun. I'll be sure to buy your album the moment it's released. 3 Chords and An Attitude, kudos!
