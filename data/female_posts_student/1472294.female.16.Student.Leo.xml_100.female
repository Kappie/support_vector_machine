My classmates who were in the band cried. It must be very shocking and disappointing for them. they practiced for a long time and always staying in school to practice till night falls. I felt sad for them, I could feel their pain and disappointment. Well, if u fall again, stand up and try to walk again... Life goes on as usual. Even for me, I fell down whenever I failed my exams and I try to stand up, although I am crawling at the moment... It means I am not trying  VERY  hard....
