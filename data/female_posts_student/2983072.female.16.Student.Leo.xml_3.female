Oh no violence in schools....So I'd like to accidentally stab him. Yeah that's it, I'll just drop the knife about 20 times then I'll feel better. No wait I gotta better idea, I think I'll just use a machine gun on the Algebra II book. That way I don't hurt anyone. I wonder if vandalism is a crime? The books are friggin old anyway, I don't think any one will mind. But no must be perfect angel as in a "horns hold up halo" kida way. Dude, alliteration rocks my socks. That reminds me I've never heard of taking a core class online, and that's exactly what I'm gonna have to do with English. There's not enough room in my schedule for that class I'm gonna experiment with this. Not that English is my favorite subject either. Your talking to the poor chid that spelled "it" wrong for Christ sake. Me and my dislexia will go run and hide now. -Note to self : I think that if my math teacher ever smiled her face would crack.
