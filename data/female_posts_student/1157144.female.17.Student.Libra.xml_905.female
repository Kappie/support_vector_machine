I'm asking because I have to give Saiyin the specifics about everything so he can tell his parents...otherwise they're going to pick him up immediately from the dance once it's over, and I kinda don't really want that to happen...they're really protective/anal-retentive about things, and so they need details about where he'll be...I'm really sorry, but would we be able to come up with an idea?
