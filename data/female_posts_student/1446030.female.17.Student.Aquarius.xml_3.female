Her actions intrigues me and often left me bewildered and puzzled. Why izzit dat sumtimes she treats me so gd dat i can get so touched dat i may even break into tears of joy? And sumtimes she treats me in a harsh, hostile manner...izzit sumthing which i did wrongly or haf i offended her in neway? Her ever-changing attitude has hurt me countless times...sumtimes, i jus wonder why i still treat her so nice and good. Izzit becos of  wat i said last time? "I treasure you alot, you are very precious to me. I'll be contented and happy just to be by your side..." But why izzit dat nowadays she dun even wans me 2 be by her side? She has hurt me alot even without noticing. I know she didn't mean it in neway...she jus dun realise... I'm feeling miserable... can sumbody ease my pain??
