I really wanted to see this one chicken painting, but I couldn't find it anywhere and I was so upset!  I saw it there in 8th grade when I went to the Institute for a field trip, and it's been my favorite ever since!  Ummm, it was fun at first . . . until I started to feel really sad, so I just walked ahead of everyone for a long time and, felt sorry for myself!   Then we went to lunch!  Me and Mark and Lori got Chinese food and everyone else went to a bakery thing!  Some homeless person asked Mark for a meal, and Mark didn't have any money so he offered the guy our leftovers, and he gave Mark a dirty look and said no!  Then he asked my uncle for some money and he gave him 2$ and then the homeless guy started to complain about how he needed more money and blah blah blah!  It's the guys fault that he is like that, if he wanted a better life, then he should have thought about his actions before he acted upon them!  Lori came over for a bit, and I took a shower so her and Mark got a bit of alone time!  They are so cute together, and they actually talk, and they don't seem shy around each other!  That makes me so happy!  THEY DIDN'T DO ANY NAUGHTY THINGS ON MY BED, that makes me happy!  Then Karina came over and we drove her to Lori's house with us!  ... Then Bob and Frank came over!  Me and Lori went downstairs to get food, and they all ditched us!  It was really sad, and it really pissed me off!  Because, I drove Karina over here to hang out with us, and then she ditches us for the guys! . . . You know what, I tried so hard to like Karina, and trust me ... it was hard considering we don't have a good background!  All she cares about is Ryan, and I'm sick of hearing about him!  Yeah, I like guys, but I don't talk and complain about them ALL the time like she does!  Ryan loves Monica, and she needs to deal with it!  She needs to find someone new!  Understand that for the time being he is with someone else, and you aren't going to get him back!  Not that she even deserves him back ... How many times did she break up with him?  If I was Ryan, I would have gotten sick of it really fast!  If she loved him as much as she did, she would have never let him go in the first place! . . . Me and Lori went to the park, and played on the swings, then on the tire swing, and the pushy thing, and then we walked back to her house because bugs were everywhere and they were eating us alive!  When we got to Lori's house Hank and Evan were in her driveway!  It made me happy because Evan is so awesome!  Ummm, we sat around his car for about 45 minutes, and then we went into the gazebo (excuse spelling) ... we umm did nothing!  We all called each other, and it was funny because we were in the same room, so yeah!  lol  Then Frank, Karina, and Bob came back!  They wouldn't tell us where they went which was bullshit!  Well, once they got back I started to feel sad so I just layed in the grass for a bit, alone!  Then some of the guys came over and Frank tried to rape me up the ass and I struggled to get away and I started to hit random people that were around me!  I just wanted to be alone!  And I called my mom and asked her to pick me up, but she said she wouldn't until her movie was over!  AHH!  Steve came home around 10 30 and they were all going to have a bon fire, yay!   Well, once I realize that I want to stay at Lori's my mom calls me and is like I'm coming to get you!  MISTAKE!  She yelled at me in the car because she said that I'm acting to depressed and she's sick of it!  Then she made me tell her the problem!  And instead of trying to comfort me, like I needed, ... she yelled at me and told me what I was doing wrong like always!    I'm really sick of all this bullshit!  I don't care about anyone anymore!  I just want to be left alone!
