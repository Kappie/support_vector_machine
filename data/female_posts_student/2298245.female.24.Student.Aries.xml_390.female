So I'm sorry everyone's comments have disappeared (I know, I know, you're thinking "what comments? there were only two or so"), but rest assured I did read them all, and I appreciate...as always...the comments.  It's nice to learn what you guys think about the blog, and me, and life.  It's also nice to be reassured in my darkest moments that I am not, indeed, insane.   So many thanks to all who read and visit this blog.  This venture is at times my own personal sounding board, my own personal anger management device, and my own personal shrink.   Here's hoping the new comments work well...and that they induce more submissions.
