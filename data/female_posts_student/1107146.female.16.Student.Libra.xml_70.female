If you don't know what the herd is, it's a long story, get Becca to explain.  He and Rosie know each other because they hang out at Chinese New Year.  Their parents know each other really well too.  Vincent is not important, but if you really want to know, he's Jackie's ex-boyfriend and a friend of mine, kind of.  He's not really important because he doesn't dare show his face at church very often anymore.  Anyway, Jackie still likes him, even though she's engaged.  And to even have a semblence of knowledge as to who Jackie is, you'd have to come to church, because she's just too complicated.  Anyone want to help me out on these explanations? Tao-Tao? Z?  Ok, I'll see yall later.  Oh, and Rosie, I want to see the car!
