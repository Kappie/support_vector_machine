Every night during that weekI usually have one to two different dreams. Well, last night was much different. I had several dreams. I only remember bits and pieces of most of them but my very last dream I remember much more clearly. It was really weird. It wasn't as crazy as some of my other dreams but it was definitely different.   Okay, it all started with Nicole, Kate (who is my ex-friend now), Alex, some other unidentifiable people, and I. We were in this big, deserted mansion. Honestly it looked more like a five star hotel then anything else. Anyways, we were all in the lounge, sitting around a warm fire on these comfortable, scarlet chairs and couches. Kate had just told a joke and Nicole and I were laughing hysterically. I took a sip from some fancy glass with an umbrella in it. Alex, who had been listening and staring at the fire, got up. He said some words to us, that he was heading up to bed or whatever, and playfully tossed a book at me. I didn't think much of it. After he left Nicole, Kate, and I continued talking. I sort of leafed through the book, but I wasn't really looking at it... I was just glancing at the pages. Well, it started getting late so Kate and Nicole decided that they were going to bed. I decided I'd go to bed as well, as I began to get up from the chair. I realised something in the pages of the book that I hadn't seen before. I waved Nicole and Kate off and they went up the wide, concrete stairs that led to the bedrooms. I opened the book up and saw half of a purple heart. On it, was a message to me. It was three sentences long. I don't remember what the first two lines said, but I remember the last one. The last sentence was,  I love you.  Underneath that was a crossed out A. The note was written to me from Alex. He loved me. Suddenly I couldn't breathe, or so it felt. It was a good feeling though. I stared into the embers of the fire, contemplating on what I should todo. With no decision made, I headed up to bed a couple of hours later.  There was something that happened after this but I don't remember it at the moment. I woke up with a good feeling. Usually when I wake up from weird dreams like this, I feel puzzled. I am confused now, but when I woke up I was happy and almost hopeful... Though it may sound stupid, I wonderif this dream has any specific meaning. Is it trying to tell me something that subconciously I know but mentally I don't? Hm... It sounds like a load of crap, doesn't it? Oh,well... What else can you expect from me?  Far, far away...
