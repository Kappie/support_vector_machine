I got my history coursework in on time *its a miracle*, and he still gave us hmwk today which we all thought was rather unfair, especially as we have had less time to get ours done than everyone else. hang on, someone has just come online who i must talk to......never mind then, they had to go moreorless as soon as i started talking to them. Lynne, i cna think of many people who wud love to see the back of ian at cdts. Me, my brother, matt, kristian, mike, carrie.... and the list goes on.... face it he is annoying everyone but you. and he is bullying me, bullying means anything that is insulting, rude or abusive be it mental, physical or verbal. He is always insulting me and being rude and calling me names, he tried to spit in my ear the other nite, and he constantly treads on my feet, trips me up and he tried to knock me off my chair the other day. Thats verbal and physical already. and mental, well, he is driving me the afore mentioned. No one likes him. there. thats betta. c ya 2moz xoxox
