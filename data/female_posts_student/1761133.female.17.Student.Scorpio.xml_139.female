Remember the good times you have shared with people of common interests and similar recreational hobbies. Feel free to be sentimental and mushy today. Mend bridges and bring consolations to sticky issues. Be harmonious with the people and situations around you. World peace begins with you. Incorporate more of this ideal into your daily life.  I'm scared...
