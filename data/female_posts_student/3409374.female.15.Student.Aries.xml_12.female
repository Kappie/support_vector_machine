Sigh...he and my mum fight again...my bro doesn't want to stay, he's been there ever so often and he's sick of the endless corridors and that medicated smell that the hospital seems to reek of. But now my bro blames my mum for passing him the disease...sigh...it's hard being Mum when ur own son hates u. Today, he sent me an email that has so much truth in it... "The hardest thing to do is to see someone u love, love someone else"..."what if tomorrow never comes?" But telling that person about ur feelings for him is easier said than done. The email sort of asked me to hurry up tell...haha...but i just can't do it...disappointment is too hard to bear...i rather live in a rhapsody of lies and fantasies...  Now i'm alone at home, without my bro...somehow i am not excited about the trip, cos someone's not going anymore...he went for last year's mountain climbing and i was so happy...for that 4 days, i knew we liked each other...but now, i guess all is lost once again. But i just can't forget...remicising the good times...
