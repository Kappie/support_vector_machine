Hard to say, since the term is still "single" (implying that you're just waiting around to be married).  My best friend is driving to Georgia today to be in her best friend's wedding (that sounds confusing and triangular, so to clarify: Andei is my best friend in grad school; Talithia is her best friendfrom college).It's going to be a hectic weekend for Andei since she's one of the bridesmaids. I hope she'll be able to have some quiet one-on-one time with Talithia before it all happens.    And, speaking ofengagements,Marcella, MY best friend from college, got engaged last week to Bonbonfera-Tim, her boyfriend of a couple of years. No date set yet, but they're really happy.
