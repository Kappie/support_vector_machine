We haven't had a chance to spend time together since school has been out. Hopefully we'll get to go play tennis next week too. I mean, if he wants to, anyways. That'd be lovely. lol  Other than that, I haven't done that much today. I went to Inky's ball game, then Taco Bell, then Kid's Dugout. Came home, got a shower, got on the computer. Pretty easy day.  I can't stop thinking about this one certain person, and he knows who he is. Well, I'm off to bed now. Love, Shannon "Put your dream away for another day, and I will take their place in your heart. Wishing on a star never got you far and so it's time to make a new start. When your dreams at night fade before you, then I'll have the right to adore you. Let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling, and put all your dreams away"-- Frank Sinatra
