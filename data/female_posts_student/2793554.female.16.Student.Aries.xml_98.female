I have a huge project due that i was supposed to be working on for the past...weeks and weeks and weeks and i just NOW started it. Im such a fucking slacker... i hope i get a B average so i can drive this summer.   I wrote this long entry, but it didnt update it for some reason. Stupid blogger.  I went to alexs birthday party last night and got all kinds of drunk and had to fend off drunk geeks. WAY fun. I wish Dylan was there... And then i woke up this morning at jessies house at like 7:30 in the MORNING to really loud banging sounds cause they were tearing down a wall of her house. And i had the wierdest dreams... one i was driving jessies car drunk and we were trying to find bryce porn and being chased by those drill things from megaman x... it was wierd. and then i had a dream that jessie had a party like, on the deck outside her house. And she wouldnt let anyone inside for some reason... ::shrug:: But anyway, now im way tired since i got like 4 hours of sleep. But i got free lunch from spicy pickle, cause jessies dad owns part of it or something.  I need to redye my hair, and go work on MORE of my homework. Poop.  abby
