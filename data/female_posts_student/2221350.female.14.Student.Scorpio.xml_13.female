Now it gets on my nerves when people rant and rave about a book/movie/game in their blog so I'll just leave it at this: it was the best movie, it far surpasses every show I've seen in the last year or so, and it belongs in the top 5 greatest pictures ever.  On our way home from the movie, I made mom stop at B and I picked up a copy of BIG FISH, the book. I'm going to let mom read it first but I can't wait!   my favorite movies? Well let's see: Forrest Gump, all Jim Careys comedies((excluding Bruce Almighty, which was a major boo-boo, with a religious undertone no less)), the Franco Zeffirelli version of Romeo and Juliet((baz lurman's disgusting parody of the play was a trainwreck and I think it's insulting and Shakespeare rolled over in his grave when he heard about it)), Ever After, Moulin Rouge, The Matrix trilogy, The Last Unicorn((75% good story, 25% nostalgic quality)), The Southpark Movie, and i'm sure I'm forgetting some. What are your favorite movies? Leave me a comment.   my least favorite movies: gigli, glitter, Halloween: resurrection, the spice girls movie, any movie EVER shown on lifetime, darkness falls, Mona Lisa smile, I think I could go on forever but right now I'm hungry... I may have already said this but I hate popcorn and I refuse to pay that much for candy so when we get out of a movie everyone except me is stuffed. That's it for now.
