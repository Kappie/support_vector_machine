I just logged into my school account to try and do another email, because it's been about a week.(and at the urging of my reader, that's singularsince I think there's only one of you out there...) Lo and behold...to my surprise, there was an email awaiting me, from the prof. My prof. That's possessive, huh? I am excited. Very Very Very  EXCITED . This means a road trip for me next weekend, and a break from Kansas. Yippee! I am planning an afternoon meeting with him, and then I think im going to stay overnight in Omaha. See the town a little. I must admit that I'm not very adventerous when Im on my own in new places, but at least I've been there once before. I may just be my big geeky self and spend all day Friday at the Omaha Zoo. Last time I was there we rushed through it. Way too fast. Oh yeah! Now I just need to reread all of the articles so that I have something to talk about with him and so that he doesn't think im not qualified to work with him. My Bio advisor said he (the professor I want towork with)has a big ego. I think he was just trying to freak me out, but he said he was an alpha male type. I can deal with non-human alpha males. He also said that "You don't have to like the professors you work with in graduate school." I was thinking, come on Dr. M. Find some more good stuff to scare me with. Anyhow, YAY!
