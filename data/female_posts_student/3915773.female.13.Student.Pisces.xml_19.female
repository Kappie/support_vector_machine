So far,  It has spent nearly $10 million in development, employed no fewer than ten writers, hired four directors and met with scores of Clark Kent hopefuls without settling on one.   The development of the movie has been littered with catastrophes; cancellations over budgets, disputes over scripts, rotating directors, and of course, the lack of a Superman. The recently replaced director for the film, Joseph McGinty Nichol, was in disagreement with Warner Brother over the location of filming. McG preferred America for reasons of authenticity and personal discomfort flying, whereas Warner Brothers chose to shoot in Australia to save $15 to $30 million. In the end, McG canceled his flight to Australia. Currently, with a new director, Warner Brothers is still working on creative and script issues for “Superman.”   With so many movies based on comic book sequels or remakes, Warner Brothers is under pressure to come up with something that will amaze audiences who have already soaked up movies such as “The Hulk” and “Daredevil.” Ahead of them are Sony Pictures Entertainment and 20th Century Fox, who have respectively profited from movies such as “Spider-Man” and “X-Men.” “Spider-Man” alone brought in over $800 million in ticket sales- not to mention income from merchandising. How will a remade “Superman” hold up? So far, there have already been 10 comic book based movies, with others such as “The Green Hornet” and “ Fantastic Four” on the way. When will audiences finally tire of this worn-out genre? Will “Superman” ever be made to win audiences before the hype is over?
