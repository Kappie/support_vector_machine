Then in the 10th, an error by Eddie Perez and a base hit by Jim Thome sealed the Braves fate.      Final score: 4-3    My daily rant: When will Bobby Cox realize that Chris Reitsma is not major league material. When Reitsma came in the game in the 8th, my first thought was "Well there goes the game." He's allowed seven runs (five earned) in his past four appearances, and has now blown leads in three games that Jaret Wright should have earned a victory. Both of Philadelphia's victories in its past five games against Atlanta have come in extra-inning games, where Reitsma has struggled in the eighth inning. It'sappears Reitsma doesn't really bare down and pitch decently until he's blown the Braves' lead or made the opponents' lead greater.
