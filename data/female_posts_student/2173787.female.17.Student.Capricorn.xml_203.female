What an amazing movie with Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands as headliners.  I finally saw it for the first time all the way through.  Its about a woman whose husband leaves her and her daughter, forcing her to move back to her small home town to live with her mother and start anew.  Watch it if you haven't, it's definitely worth it.   "The American Dream. You find something that you love and then you twist it and torture it trying to find a way to make money at it.  You can spend a lifetime doing that and at the end you can't find a trace of what you started out loving." - Hope Floats
