So I called Ryan and asked if that would be ok. He said yeah but that his feelings were a little hurt. I totally understood. I felt bad but Ryan understood.   When we got to Ashleys house we went to the pool and ashley saw her "Life Gaurd". hehe... we srayed at the pool for like 30 min. Then we left to go to my house to eat my "Special" dinner. We went to the video store and we rented Secret Window. Then when we got back to her house and we ended up going to get starbucks and we talked there for a good hour and a half. When we got back this guy would not leave ashley alone. He called and asked if we wanted to go to lake hubberd to shoot off fire works. We said no.   Jesse called us and wanted us to go up to Brandon Tates house to look and talk about cars....oohhh ahhhh...So we said sure and we went over there. Ryan called me and was upset that I went over there. But then we talked everything out and everything was A-ok! When we got there Jesse really didnt spend time with Ashley we went to play with tha cars. So when we left he asked Ashley for a hug and she started to walk off. Then she was like ooooo kkkkk give me a hug! Jesse told her NO! As we were walking off everyone was telling Jesse to give her a hug. I looked at Ashley min. before we were about to leave and told her Jesse was coming. They made up and kissed! Aweee....  So we went to her house and we tried to watch the Secret Window but we fell asleep. Well Church here we come!
