She said take  a seat and the rest and then she put 5 dota on my tongue 2 c how far 4ward or how far back I wanted it, I chose the 3rd dot, in the middle, im not 2 sure if I shld hav had the 2nd  one (from the fron of the tongue up wards, 5 bein the furthest back) but that might b just cos wit is swelled up now.2much tlkin-lol. Anywayz I asked if they numb it and she said no- so I kinda had little thoughts goin through my head of  “that’s quite a big  bita flesh 4 a metal rod 2 but put through with no anesthetic”…well somit 2 mumb it by, although with my belly button they didn’t numb it and that’s gona really hurt, bugger! Nto kinda doubts just kinda realisein wots gona happen-lol- So she put the clamp on which didn’t hurt at all,even tho I was told that that hurts more than the piercing tis self-lol, and then it came……… She put the needle or wotever through my tongue. I was gona look but she said “close ur eyes” so I kinda did cos at that point I was just kinda following instructions cos I was kidna in vunerable position. So I didn’t c it being pirced-think tho It wasbetter that I didn’t c it. It did hurt, but it was  a standable pain. I felt it pierce tyeh top of the tongue but I cldnt feel it go through really, kinda don’t remember the pain anymore. Was completely fine when she had put the bar through. Just had som water and spat it out in the sink and she just went “wooo” and I was like o sorry, cos I thought she wasn’t expectin me 2 spit in her sink even tho she said feel free if u wana spit the water out. But it was only cos she said that the tongue piercing usually affects ur spittin, and I just spat normally, not like a bit of a knob cheese-lol I was lispin through out the rest of the shpoppin trip (didn’t egt it pierced straight away, got it done around 3 I think and we  got the 5.20 train from brighton SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY 2 nat, she will know y and I kinda feel a bit shitty about it so im not gona out it on here soz again nat my tongue is aching like hell now, just had som soup.cant eat youghurts 2 save my life, think I pulled a muscle when i got it pierced cos u hav 2 stick ur tongue out and when I got it done  the only pain straight after it was pierced was my left side of my leck, under my jaw. Speakin like a complete twat at the mo. Was speakina bit 2 much I think round brighton. Has only been since I hav been home that it has start 2 feel enlarged. It doesn’t feel weird in tongue either, feels kinda natural-lol- although went I was first pierced I kinda flet like somthign had invaded my space in my mouth, byut all was cool-lol- altogether I had a pretty cool day shoppin, with simon, alex and nat. I thought that we weren’t gona make it 2 the art th8ing and miss it cos by the time we got 2 the school ti was about 6.25/6.30, but I went in and asked and they said na I cld just walk around and they think its on till 7, so I shouwed simon my art book and my final pieces.My final pieces r a ll on the wall, including my 1 with the mud rock, which I thought wld rip down cos of the weight of it on the paper, but luckily it hasn’t…yet-lol Gota dice necklace 4 a £1 – bargin!-lol  	I think nat is glad with her purchases from the vintage shope and that other “magical” shop.
