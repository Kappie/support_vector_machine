After waiing forever to use one, my machine kept breaking in the middle the cycle. The washing machine door was flying open and water was going everywhere. I called the chief electrician and he came. What a mess. I hate doing laundry on this ship. Next time, I think I will send all of my clothes down to the Chinese Laundry and have them do it for me again.   I watched Indecent Proposal last night.  I haven't seen that movie in ages. It was weird. Demi Moore is such a cat though - just a beautiful woman. Wow.   It's raining in Puerto Vallarta. Yesterday was the first time I had seen rain in almost 2 months. I loved it. I just sat in the rain and talked with friends.   Oh, man, got a call. Have to run - I will write more later today.
