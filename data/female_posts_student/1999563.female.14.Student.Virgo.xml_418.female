So we went to Portland and I was being really dumb because I am sick and tied and my mom yelled at me. I felt really guilty...  Then I saw this HUGE group of guys. There were lke 30 of them and they were all my age. Hahah.  I am supposed to be ushering at CYT right now but I am too sick so I went home instead.  I was going to write a totally huge rambeling of everything but, alas, I am going to finish my BEAUTIFUL science poster.  I heart science.
