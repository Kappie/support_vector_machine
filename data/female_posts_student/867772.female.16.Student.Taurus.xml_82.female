The results were kind of interesting, which is the only reason why I'm posting this.  Apparently...  These are my priorities, in order of importance: -Love -Family -Career -Pride -Money  I am LOYAL. My partner is MYSTERIOUS. My enemies are BRAINDEAD. I interpret sex as INTERESTING. My life is POWERFUL.  JOYCE is someone I will never forget. I consider NINA a true friend. I really love *******. CASSIE is my twin soul. I will remember KATIE for the rest of my life.  Well...  I loved this test, for the sole reason that they compared sex to coffee.
