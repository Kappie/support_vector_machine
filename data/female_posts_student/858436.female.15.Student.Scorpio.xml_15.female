Got some close contact in there now didn't we, Court and Cait?! Haha.   Just ate food, sat around the bonfire, laid on top of each other at the sacred ground as JP would say. :-P I had a great time. I became more comfortable around a lot of people I didn't know very well.   If there's one thing I've learned from being at ND so far, it's that you should give people a second chance after your first impression. Because a lot of times it's totally different that what you thought before.   Bye babes.
