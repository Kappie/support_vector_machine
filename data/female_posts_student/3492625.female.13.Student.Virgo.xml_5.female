Anyway, today I went to the mall and got a calander to add to my collection. It is a calander with Pembroke Corgis on it! Cute! It will join the wall where I have my two wolf calanders and my Shiba Inu calander.   I got a Cinnabon! YUMMY! ^^  Also on neo I finally got my hands on a brown pb. Now I'm setting my sights on a white one. Neo username is wolfsrayne if you want to donate. *puppy eyes*
