As I have mentioned before, I am a list person, so I best think and write my thoughts as such�a list that is.   1. It is now the beginning of my fourth week at  urlLink United Rentals . I work 7am to about 6pm, long days. The days move pretty quickly, so it isn�t bad at all. I make $10 an hour, so overtime will be really nice! I got my first paycheck this last Friday, and damn does it feel good. Too bad it is practically already spent�catching up on things I haven�t paid since I have been out of work at the beginning of April. Ah well.  2. The situation with Rob�I have seen him for about 5 weekends in a row now. We have been pretty much exclusive. We had a chat the other day, as I had questioned why we weren�t together if we weren�t seeing anyone else. End of a long story�he will be taking some time to think, get his thoughts together. He doesn�t want to commit to a relationship and feels that he would be passing up the opportunity to meet someone else. So I am leaving it at that. He knows I will always be here to talk to, and he calls daily which is wonderful, but I have put a hold to what I was going for originally with him. Going to wait to see how things pan out I suppose.  3. I want to publicly thank the wonderful Jason Brown for the awesome CD�s that he burned and brought me on Sunday. I think this may be the first time I have introduced the lad, but I think and hope to be writing a bit more about him. He is a friend from Northridge, works as a computer programmer for a banking institution down that ways, and he and I seem to have tons in common. He unfortunately is in a relationship, well a type of relationship at the moment. Yet more patience on my part�going to hang around as a friend, one of my best capacities ever I admit, but I think it may be time for something more for Traci. Stay tuned to see how things with Jason turn.  4. I now want to publicly apologize to Steve and Melissa. Things are rough for me and Steve. There was a point that I wanted to explore more than our friendship, but after a serious talk, I realized (not only was he not interested in exploring) that we were much better off as friends. I considered us good friends at that. While things were rough with Rob and I, things seemed to be going excellent for Steve and his beautiful girlfriend Melissa. End of a long story�I partook of some alcohol (which Steve quickly pointed out was of my own volition and can not be claimed as a defense, even in the State of California system of law) and because of it didn�t take the time to think of what I was saying before I said things. My complete bad�I admit this. I made a statement at a party, the first time I met Melissa in fact, that offended her. To Melissa, I hope you read this, I had some meaning behind what I said, and I am sorry I did not know better and phrase what I was trying to say in a better way. I hope to have the opportunity to regain the respect from both you and Steve that I lost in my first impression. I have never seen Steve be as happy, as excited, and as school-boyish as he is when he talks about you. I saw this and it made me so happy that he was happy, something he has been waiting for�perfection. Because of the times I was going through, I didn�t give the two of you the congrats you deserved. I apologize. That night at the party, the two of you did nothing but make sense. Unfortunately all I did has hurt both of you, and as a result I have lost the respect I had from Steve, a good friend I talked with, and with his Steve-ness seemed to make things a little better. I have talked with him, and I hope this strengthens all I told him. I hope to be able to gain back some of the respect that I have lost�from both of you.  5. I invite everyone to the premiere of �Jesus Christ Superstar�. Funny thing, it opens on my birthday July 18th. It will be an awesome show�Jerusalem Meets the Matrix. Show times are: Friday July 18th, 8:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Saturday July 19th, 8:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Sunday July 20th, 2:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Friday July 25th, 8:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Saturday July 26th, 8:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Sunday July 27th, 2:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center  I think that is it at this juncture. I will write more. I promise. Especially you  urlLink Chris , Mr. �I have a cool new Blog and I am going to give Traci a hard time because she doesn�t even write in hers anymore.� Guess I will show him!
