I broke up with my boyfriend last thursday and I had gone out with him for a year and like about to be 5 months.  I miss him so much and I still love him more than anything.  I had my reasons but someone lied to me about everything and made it seem alot worse than it was.  I just wish that I would have never been so jealous.  I hate the way things are right now.  Anyways not like anyone wants to hear this but I just had to say it.  I have some of the best friends ever who have been there for me through all of this and who are prolly extremely tired of me talking about and being sad. But I just want to say thanks to all of you.  I cant wait till I go to Padre this summer b/c I am just going to have so much fun.  I also cant wait till Sarah and I go to Oklahoma to see my cousin and uncle.  That is all going to be a blast.  Summer just officially started today and it was pretty fun.  I helped my dad put shocks on my explorer that was fun I love working on cars.  I cant wait till we move it is going to be so fun to be like the only girl in my house that my mom has to buy for I am going to be even more spoiled than I am now.  I feel like I need to get a job b/c it feels like Sarah and I are the only ones who dont have a job this summer.  I dont want one though b/c I dont want to miss out on all the fun, and I kinda like not having to work b/c my mom just gets me what I want.  Well I am going to watch t.v.   Jess
