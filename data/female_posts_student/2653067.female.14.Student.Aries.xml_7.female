Robin and I were originally suppose to go to Kevan's place on Friday night but Robin's mother told her that she couldn't go for a sleepover so instead, Robin went to the Yc to hang with Bob and company.  Yes, we were dissapointed but we had fun on our own.  I went to Kevan's house at around 6:30.  Once I got there, we went to mings to go get some gummy candies and chips (This is now a ritual).  We then ate dinner and then played donkey kong country 3 on kevan's old nintendo system.    After playing nintendo and eating our candy, we headed outside to bounce on the soaked trampoline.  I borrowed big black sweatpants and a baggy black sweat shirt from kevan and started immatating a "Yo Yo Yo-er"*.  It was all very funny.  Bouncing on the trampoline got tiring so Kevan and I went inside to secretly eat our chips.  We then drifted off to sleep..  *A Yo Yo Yo-er is a rapper    Saturday: Kevan and I awoke and ate a delicious breakfast that Rodger prepared for us.  Next, we played donkey kong and then went on the computer.  I insisted that we go on msn because there was nothing else to do.  From 1:30 to 3:00, we talked to this 20 year-old guy named Brad.  He had a web cam which made the convo interesting.  I don't really know what the conversation was about but I do remember him telling us that he had a car that was much to small to be a "Shaggin Wagon". Kevan had to go to Kaitlyn's at 3:30 so she dropped me off at home. *Hours passed*  Kevan called at 6 to ask if I wanted to get together with her and Robin.   I did because they are my friends.  I spent about 2 and a half hours trying to get a hold of my mom to ask if they could come over.  The answer was no.  A little while passed.  I was home alone in a dark spooky house.  Yes, I admit I was spooked.  I was on the phone with Kevan and I told her that I was home alone and freaked out.  Kevan then came to my rescue and told me that I was aloud over!  Kevan, Jenna and Rodger were in my driveway within 15 minutes to pick me up.  After we arrived at their home, the Scotts prepared me a lovely hamburger.  Kevan explained to her dad that the two mouse-cateers were lonely and she asked if the 3rd cateer could join us.  He said yes and than the 3 mouse-cateers were reunited.  After playing poke the bunny, eating dessert and going on the trampoline, we all called it a night and hit the hay.    Kevan and Robin were on the bed and I was on the floor.  Jenna heard some odd noises in her room and decided to come sleep on the floor in Kevans room.  Everyone started to attack eachother.  Robin ended up sleeping on the floor near Jenna and I and Kevan on the bed.   Sunday (today): I opened my left eye and saw Kevan looking at the ceiling.  She then got up and left the room.  I sat up and noticed that Jenna was gone and that Robin was still sleeping.  I crept out of the room and yes, I went downstairs and played nintendo.  We were than called up for breakfast.  Robin was awake by then.  After breakfast, we played nintendo, played on the computer and than made sandwiches and bounced on the trampoline.  Robin left at 3.  Kevan and I went on the comp and talked to Brad again.  I than left a 4:15 and I am now writting in my blog.    I am freaked out because my old buddy from quebec and his friends are talking to me.  *Shivers*.  I am in a bloody convo with 4 weird french boys.  I think I'm going to leave.    See ya later Folks!    (Hey, this is a long entry!)
