On to other things. My dad took me out driving today. I'm getting more used to it I think. I'm still having a little trouble because I'm learning stick-shift because I'll be driving the old '86 Honda Accord. The stupid piece of shit is what I think to myself. It's great. I get to load it up with bumper stickers so it'll be so run-down and tacky. So cool. I was saying all this to Amanda and she said, "I've never heard anybody talk like you." That made me laugh. I know it is weird to want a bad car but I do. I've picked out my Misfits sticker already and have AFI ones that I got a long time ago. I'll probably get an EBHC (East Bay Hard Core) sticker. I'm even thinking of getting that Misfits Licence Plate border from infinity1.com - how super would that be?  I've never seen one, but how about a Joy Divison sticker? If I could find one that'd be great.But anyway.  Today is my parent's 19th anniversary. I don't know how they do it other than my dad is probably the most patient man you'll ever meet. I always wonder if they stay together for me and my sister and wonder what'll happen when we both leave the house. It's kind of scary since it's been more than once that a divorce threatened. I don't like to think about that though.   I feel like watching Rocky. I watch a lot of movies.  I'm so ready for school to start. Summer is so boring. I know I don't sound like myself but I had a really good 2nd semester before summer started and didn't want it to end because usually school never goes well for me. I don't know why it was getting better. I think it's because I've matured and all that jazz and I've tryed to make the most of things and everything. In any case, I can't wait to graduate and I'm one year closer. Alot of people I know will be graduating next year and then it's me. It's strange how quickly school passes. You're in 6th grade and so far off and think it'll never end and you want it so desperatly to speed up but now that I'm going to be in 11th grade I regret wanting it to pass and for being miserable. I should have tried harder to not let school get me down.   I was on livejournal looking at the latest posts. I do that alot. It gives me something to do. Surveys and quizzes galore and all that. But anyway. Somebody posted this line from an emo song and if anybody sees this and knows where it's from, can you comment and tell me? It sounds kind of worth looking into.   I carved your name into the bullet so everyone knows that you're the last thing to go through my head.   It might be a little different because I looked up on google "...bullet so now you know that..." because that was the original wording from the person's post, but the only result I got was the line above from somebody else's blog that wasn't even up.  I think that is all. I think I might sleep in tomorrow. I'm not sure though. Depends on how I feel or when I fall asleep. Something like that.     Music: Radio - Alkaline Trio
