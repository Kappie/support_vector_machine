Anyway, without further ado, I present you:  The Perfect Man ;) The perfect man is gentle, never cruel or mean, He has a beautiful smile, And keeps his face so clean. The perfect man likes children, And will raise them by your side. He will be a good father As well as a good husband to his bride. The perfect man loves cooking, Cleaning and vacuuming too; He’ll do anything in his power To convey his love to you. The perfect man is sweet, Writing poetry from your name; He’s a best friend to your mother And kisses away the pain. He never has made you cry Or hurt you in any way Oh, f*** this stupid poem, The perfect man is gay.  I admit a little crude - but meh....next time I'll post something more 'creative'...
