You start feeling insuecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but the get scared because you barely know where you are now.   You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to arent exactly the greatest people you have ever met and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you do not realize is that they are realizing that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.   You look at your job. It is not even close to what you thought you would be doing or maybe you are looking for ones and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and are scared.  You miss the comforts of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they werent so great after all.  You are beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You've seen what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more then usual because suddenly you realized that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to you list of what is acceptable and what is not.   You are insecure and then secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused.  Suddenly changes is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life but soon realized that the past is drifting futher and further away and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.  You've got your heart broken and wonder how someone you love could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you cant meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you are not a bad person.  One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap and getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look like apathetic fool. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over and talked with friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision.  You worry about loans, money, the future, saving bonds, making life for yourself and while winning a compatitive game, right now you'd just like to be contender! What you may not realized is that everyone reading this relates to it. We all are in out best times and out worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.   This is exactly how I feel and wonder if there are people out there who feels the same way. Life is best when you realize the moment that you`re in and cherish it forever. I think the greatest thing is having a dream and then reaching it. I realize that sometimes you have to work extra hard to get there, and once you are there..ENJOY IT!!!
