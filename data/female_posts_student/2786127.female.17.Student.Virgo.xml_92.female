I hate these days but at the same time love them, I feel like im accomplishing things, and my room is nice and pretty when im done. woo!.  speaking of getting things done, I still haven't talked to tim yet. Today is the day. Nate is an ass, again. he was supposed to call me yesterday. He called me in the morning, said we couldn't hang out until later because he had to go paint the stage at knock em dead, so he said he'd call me when he was done. Who didn't ever recieve a phone call? thats right, Jessica didn't. grr. this only furthers my decision to swear off boys for the remainder of high school.  I want volleyball....and disneyland. DISNEYLAND! I'm so terribly excited. Lets go now. I need a little small world to brighten me up a bit.   "what are you going to do today Napolean?"   "whatever i feel like doing...God."  Best. Movie. Ever.
