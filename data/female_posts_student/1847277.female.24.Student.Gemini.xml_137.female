I don't mean to yell at my loyal (or not so loyal readers), especially since I wasn't able to provide a birthday shout out to one of them because I was stuck in Montenegro (happy late bday Jerrywill- see, I'm only a month and a couple weeks late), and I guess I owe Mike a much less late but still belated happy birthday, too! Let's just celebrate everyone's birthdays on one day.  Like a second Christmas, but preferably during the summer.
