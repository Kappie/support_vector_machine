I HOPE she understands and has absorbed our conversation and knows where my true feelings are in the matter.  I hope she gives me the same respect as I am giving her and to not judge each other anymore because in the end we are not in each other's shoes.  I must say I was let down by a friend.  A firend that could have shed light onto the situation.  Will I revoke a friend's certain status?  Hell no, I am am not like that.  But I considered her a part of the family...when she heard of my sister's feelings, there was a clear opportunity to shed light on the subject, but she didn't.  Yes it isn't her job, but she could have bettered the situation if she would have just clarify that her family does not hold ill feelings toward her.  She knew that better than anyone....so that friend, your failure to act has made me question whether your intentions to be my friend are true.  I love my family and have shared my loss of friends, some closer to me than most people and some just mere acquaintances, but all losses in my heart.  I would hate to lose more over trivial things.  I hope that in life we all understand that sometimes silence is more poisonous than speaking out.
