It started off with Monty and Luke doing a very bongled organisation of the day. Luke messaging people, but then his phone dying before anyone could reply, and then e-mailing people in the library at 12.00 saying come and have lunch with us at 12.30, Great, jsut great. They arrived at my house about 12.15 to pick me up and we then journeyed to T1's house and picked him up, all the while Luke and Monty gleefully showed me how they had started an eventually unsuccessful game of 'The Soap Game' (starting off with soap and swapping it with people for somthing of equal or greater value) They had got a little pot of, well, pot. Naa not really, it was Chinese Tea leaves, but it sure looked and smelt like pot! The game ended here seeing as no-one wanted 2 swap it for anything. So we ventured to the park behind the Church (this is where people were 'sposed to meet, but no-one showed up) Tom wasn't in the Church Centre, so he missed out on our wonderfully nutritious lunch, which consisted of little packets of chips, bread and sunkist and lemonade. We sat on the seesaw which wasn't a very good choice, but it sure ws funny 2 be on, seeing as all of our stuff was knocked around. I felt like 'one of the guys' as we sat there, burping after drinking and all, talking about such things as, weight, drugs and alcohol, including where is the best place 2 stash it, and funny drug stories, which included people who called up the police because some1 stole their marijuana plants, and we then moved on to the most painful way we've hurt ourselves, and Luke showed us his war scars. Luke and I had pretty much the best pain stories, which was nails through both of his feet and a rusty nail straight through my hand (we all know THAT story...) while T1 sat there wincing in pain at what we had gone through. Haha. We then saw Helen drive up, and we all came and had a nice chat with her. It's great to have her back. I missed her :) We then proceeded to go to the swings, where Monty swung the swing around the pole so it was really high up, and then swung on it, shame we didn't have a camera on us. It was quite a funny scene. But trying 2 get it down was the real effot. All Luke acheived was getting the swing up much higher, and getting it tangled around the bolt. So the guys spent the next 20 minutes attempting to get this swing down back to its normal level, while I stood there laughing. We chatted some more, then Luke asked the time, and once again he had to rush off, and he nearly missed his bus. He's getting quite a rep with me now... Monty and T1 then walked me home, while we amused ourselves by kicking the empty Sunkist bottle in front of us. It eventually went on the road, and a car was coming along and T1 kicked it straight at the car by accident. It was quite funny. But yeh, that was my day. Did i mention it was quite cold?
