And time is soon going to be a big issue. But anyway, this afternoon was interesting: I headed down to York Arts after a short lesson in driving a stick shift on hills with Mom, and ended up going door-to-door in the city, handing out Art in the Parks flyers. In 'da hood, as Justin says. In short, it was kinda scary, and really hot. I'm a naive girl from the heart of suburbia (and also farmland, if you count the 'Bury) so i don't really have any experience walking around the city. But I didn't die or anything, and I met some cool, or at least nice, people. Score.  Joe's coming back tonight! Weee!
