I really think I had a vision of it before.  I was thinking about dreams I had in the past and I remembered the one were I was walking through the Science wing and all these strange people said "Vanessa come it" and I walked into Mrs. J's room.  Now that I think of it - it was basically the future.  I foresaw that I would have another class with her.  Either it's a coincidence or I really dreamt the future!  Scary thought!  I bought the followed up novel for speak - Catalyst.  It is absolutely AMAZING!  I can sooo relate to it, especially because the main theme through it is Chemistry.  I miss chem!  Anyways yeah I went to Vanessa W's place yesterday for her b-day.  I had a fun time, although I am all "junked up" from all the shit that I ate that I probably could have done without.  I also finished my Drama project too, and now I just have to finish my warm-up which I am pretty well almost done.  Today I also want to review the Bio stuff we learn cause she said we might have a quiz Tuesday.  I will do good on that, cause I can.  And well I think I might go to the doctors sometime this week because I think on my stomach I am having some sort of allergic reaction.  I don't what it is and last time I went to the doctors they told me it was acne - but it's not because this stuff like swells up, is itchy, and painful.  Ok no offence, doctor or not, I know for a fact that's not acne.  I really need to find out what it is too, because I was actually going to go get a piercing there without telling anyone.  However, I need to find out if anything is going to cause me to have a reaction, cause if my mom ever found out I would be one very dead gal!
