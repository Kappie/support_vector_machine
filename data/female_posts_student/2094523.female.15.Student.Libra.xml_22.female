Im doin good in school 80-90 averages in subjects or so..but why does it matter anymore..i dont give a shyt..why is school such a big issue in ure mind anyways..i mean if u can't live life right, ure not gaining anything from it, its not making u extremely happy, and ure gettin sick of this fawk.. then a 100 average in school isnt gonna do jack shyt
