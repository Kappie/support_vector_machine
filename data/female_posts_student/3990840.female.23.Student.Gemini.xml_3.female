A whole bunch of the numbers were fudged, but if you make some fairly reasonable assumptions, it all comes down to how long you think a intelligent, technologically advanced society, will last.  Ours, for example, has lasted since around 1940, or about 65 years (Technologically advanced = radiowave producing).  So, if you assume 100 years for the duration of a technologically advanced society, the equation spits out that there are 100 planets with technologically advanced societies right now in our galaxy (the number is the same as the number of years you assume).  The reason technologically advanced matters is that we can detect radiowaves, but don't really have any other way of knowing if there is life on a planet, hence SETI.  The reason we're not finding all of these civilizations is that they are absurdly spread out... space is just that... a whole lot of empty space.  Also interestingly... if you use much more pessimistic assumptions in the equation and decide that we are the only intelligent life in our galaxy, and that there are technologically advanced societies in 1 out of every 100 galaxies, you still end up with a whole lot of intelligent life in the universe.  Basically, we are not alone.  Speaking of intelligent life... I managed to put my bike back together after 2+ months in storage, and it works!  Well... nearly works.  The break pads on the rear wheel are too tight and rub, making riding significantly more of a workout.  So if anyone knows how to adjust that, input would be appreciated.    Went to the pool this afternoon and spent some time on the boards (second day in a row after 5 months off) and tried to reacclimate myself.  I had forgotten some of the random parts of my body that diving exercises... like the muscles in the bottom of my feet when I'm taking off backwards... who knew?  And I did something funky to my left lower back, but hopefully some Motrin and sleep will fix that by tomorrow.  I think I'm going to try to make it on the boards at least 4 times a week, and onto my bike (if I can fix the break) for exercise type rides most days (if it will stop raining).    But now, since my text book has arrived (thank you Amazon for overnight delivery), I have four days of reading and work to catch up on.  I think I'll crack open on of my Wildberry Jacks... but first, off to Walmart to pick up my film from Spain.  So much to do!  Hasta luego.
