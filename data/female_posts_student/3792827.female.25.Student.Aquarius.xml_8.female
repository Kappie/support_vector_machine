I will be updating it soon though... hopefully I will have more to say then.  Oh, my kitten is STILL sick. I had to bring him back to the Vet because he's still having some problems. He had a temp of 103! The Vet gave him some more antibiotics. Hopefully that will do the trick. Now it is looking like he has some kind of intestinal infection.
