The only time I didn't was when I was on my break..or when I counted my drawer. But yeah..I get payed. The only entertaining thing about today was Mallory fixing Ian's boo boo when he cutted himself cutting lettuce. Nothing happened at the cashier's desk today except me reading my YM magazine and drawing..haha. Oh and Chris using my cell phone because he said his "is a piece of crap"..and I talked to the lifeguards too..like Drew and Harmony. I have work cashier again on Wednesday and Saturday..and I come to the staff party on Thursday (If I decide to go..but I think I will..good times on the waterslide :). Tommorrow..no big plans..maybe getting some hours for my permit..I got some time today! I need to get together with friends soon..maybe next weekend..because this weekend I am booked! I can't wait till' Friday..John Mayer  and  Maroon 5  in concert!  Then I'm working the rest of the weekend. So yeah..that's all I have..later!
