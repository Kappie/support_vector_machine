(sorry, need some monolog dalam counselling)      Recently my friend's dad got 'promoted' to be Elder in the church. I teased her by calling her 'Elder's daughter', she then backfired "at least I'm not a preacher's daughter". It seems people have problems with that. The preacher's daughter title thing.    Is it true that preacher's daughters are expected or required to behave kinder, gentler, holier and better than everyone else? I suppose in a sense that would make sense since pastors are required to do what preach and therefore encourage their children to be more Christ-like.   However those children whose parents are Christians shouldn't be any more different from pastor's kids.       Anyway since the time my friend hinted bout the preacher's kids' requirement to be holier, I've been sorta observing pastor's kids around. No not a research just take more notice- how they behave and stuff. Most of them, they either turn out very well: youth leaders, wonderful results, lotsa talents.    A few though, perhaps because of the pressure become rebellious. I think its stressful sometimes, imagine your parent this holy holy fella then you gotta like keep up the reputation then you become rebellious and want to have nothing to do with your strict family. Bah I don't know what I'm getting at already. I got too distracted chatting.       Quite a few songs on the radio have lines that go 'I was a preacher's daughter blahblahblah', perhaps implying that they got fed-up of being one they decided to become what they are now? I have a friend who dropped out of school because he just didn't want to continue anymore. He was this close to finishing school,  this close . Yes, he father is a pastor. Sad, no? I don't really know the details. He could have become rebellious because of the lack of encouragement from his parents. Or perhaps he couldn't keep up with reputation nonsense and then just rebelled.       Sure, I gotta admit sometimes you can feel people keep their eyes on you because your dad is a pastor. And it doesn't feel comfortable at all. They assume you do well in school, you at least play one music instrument, you read the Bible pray everyday and you'rea leader in your CF or youth group. I don't think its on purpose, that they keep their eyes on you and pinpoint when you do make a mistake. Its human behaviour. Haha, yes human behaviour. I seem to blame the human behaviour for everything. :p    *'They' refers to the congregation, people who know your parent is a pastor         MPH is having a Young Writers Competition. You've to write a story about yourself. I'm thinking of entering. Not more than 800 words for my age group. I have an advantage, since I'm the oldest of my age group (age 13-15), and  perhaps, only perhaps  my maturity and two more years of experinece with my life  may  help. The thing is, its due next week, end of July. Today is the 24th of July. Hah all the best, Mary-Ruth!    Since you've to write about yourself, I'm thinking of telling the truth and writing my experience as a pastor's daughter, as the daughter of an eccentric writer and the sister of a seven year older psycho hyper genius.    Tell me, whoever reads this.. Do I have a chance? I need your feedback quick. Now I'm wondering who will read this my this weekend. Probably nobody. Haha oops. I mean, I doubt anyone comes here regularly. I just write because my fingers itch to fart out the blahblah in my head.       *waves*      Blahblah,   Mary-Root
