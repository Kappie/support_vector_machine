But yeah. This upcoming election, as anyone with reasonable sentience (and eyes) can see, is not about liberty, or war, or gay rights, or patriotism, or any of those pretty words. This election is all about Bush. Some people just can't get enough of Bush. They want twice as much Buch. More Bush, please. Bush, Bush, Bush.   Basically, most of us who are considering The Kerry as a plausible vote-receiver do so simply because of our loss of respect for Bush. (Or else some of them never respected him at all, but it's all in the anti-Bush pie.) Bush is wrong. Bush sucketh. Anyone but Bush. Hold the Bush. Bush, Bush, Bush.   Ugh.... I would really, really love to be extra-super rebellious and vote for an independent candidate, but frankly, I don't find any of them any more appealing than Kerry, and at least Kerry, being affiliated with the Dems, has some chance of winning in the real world.   But in all honesty, I'll probably end up voting for Kerry, assuming I don't find anything that disturbs me on his record.   But come on... we're sick of all the Kerry-bashing. That's old news. We should get back to Bush.   See, I keep clicking random blogs and finding ICH HEART BUSH essentially plastered across the page. It's crazy. The thing is, though, so many of them are all like "Mryah, Kerry sucks" that I feel bad for them. I mean, why don't you rise above the opposition instead of stooping to the level of what one of you so aptly called the "party of hate?"   So on one chick's "personal weblog," which was more like a liberal-hating database, she had a link with a picture of a beer bottle cap which said Bush-Cheney. Its description read, "Bush Buds."   Oh. Wow. I bet Bush is pleased to see that his supporters photoshopped his name onto a Bud label.   Anyway, the site linked to  urlLink this  place. It's called Kerry Core, or Kerry-Core, or something similar, and is a nice idea if you're into paying for domain names for the purpose of making fun of a single man. HOWEVER, there are, as far as I can see, three things fundamentally wrong with this.   Number one: People insulting Kerry think they are Bush's buds. Unless Bush is as dumb as all those cartoons make him out to be, he probably doesn't want to run Kerry's name into the ground. What they are doing by insulting one candidate in the name of another is giving a few people a laugh and a few people another reason to dislike Bush. This basically blows as a move to further any sort of cause, unless your cause is to be annoyingly uninteresting.  Not only is that anti-Kerry thing sehr overdone, it is also done here in a rather unoriginal way. This is the second thing wrong with this site - it's actually not even witty or funny at all.Their idea of biting criticism is "'[Bush] must think we Democrats are the most idiotic buffoons on the planet', said Kerry."   Mmm. Subtle.   I mean, if you're going to make a site that satirizes the campaign site of someone else, you'd better damn well make me either wince or giggle. They describe Democratic supporters as "angry, dirty foaming hippies," and I swear to God, if Isee that stupid "liberal-tree-hugger" concept trotted out one more time, I am going to take my tree and shove it up someone's ass.   But still, it's just mundane, regurgitated criticism of Kerry thinly veiled as some sort of clever parody.   This bring me to the third thing wrong here..... When you open the webpage, the description at the top says "John Kerry 2004 Parody Website."   Real clever, guys.   Audrey's tip of the day - if you have to explain to your readers that what you are writing is parody, then either your readers are blind, retarded bunnies, or you are not writing very good parody. If anyone actually reads this boring website consistently, I think both of those things would have to be true.   I am abso-fucking-lutely FINE with people voting for Bush, as long as they've put some thought into it. But this site isn't a very good way to show your support of any candidate who has minimal standards of self-respect.If you're going to spend time and money on dissing ANYONE, you might as well do it ina format that's aesthetically pleasing, or at least uses some cool fonts.
