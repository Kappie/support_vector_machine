Think hard about the words you say before you say them, those words can't be earsed once they've been spoken. Make it a point always to speak positively- words of kindness, helpfulness, and mercy. Use your "power" for good!  Kinds words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless. -Mother Teresa  Words are the things that we use to communicate with people. So in order to communicate well with people, not only our body language is important, the describing words and emotional words that we use are useful too. Whether we build someone up or not depends on our words. Therefore, God gave us a mouth and two ears in a way that we will hear more than we say. -Abigail
