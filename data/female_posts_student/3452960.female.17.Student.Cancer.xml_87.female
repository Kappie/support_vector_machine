Chips, chips, bad for your heart  but as for wedges, where do i start?  they are bad for you in the extreme;  they'll turn your insides to clotted cream  no-one will hear your silent scream  as you eternally sleep, of chips you shall dream.  Why did i eat wedges? why oh why?  you'll sit down there and start to cry  wedges are truly traitorous  a horrible use for the honest potatorus.
