O well you are going to anyways (that is why you are reading this) Well lets see today i hepled Jake make his blog (you can read it. it is jacobloveskari.blogspot.com)while i was supposed to be helping with the little kids band this morning it was so funny. Then Mr. Turner told me to go help the lil 5ht graders keep time. They are really funny. So then when they were Tré come to pick me up and we went and got subway. YUMMY. Well then Tré and i decided we didn't want to sit in the house on such a nice day we went to the mall. I spent a bunch of money. I got the New Found Glory CD i got a book of art work by Amy Brown.(and if you don't know who she is she does really cool drawings of faries which i am obssesed with.)And i got a record (Yes record) of an old AFI cd. I felt very special. Wait i am a very "Specail" person.LOL. If you get my drift. So then Tre and i came home and started to watch 50 first dates and then Jacob called me with some very bad news. He said it was nothing to get upset about but his daddy and mommy might be moving. I guess i won't worrie about it yet but i don't want my jacob to move. I was planing on haveing atleast till the end of the year with him then i know he will gradumatate but that is still a long time. So anyways after i got off the fone with (cuz he had to go to work) i took a nap. Then at like 5 heather called me to ask me if i could give her a ride home then like 10 mintues later she calls me back to tell me that she doesn't So then i eat and go to pratice and goof around. So yea that was my day. How was yours?? Peace out
