It probably aroused his interest because we emailed each other a couple of times before we actually met. I just thought I’d write to him because he was my age and he kinda listened to the stuff I listened to and we both knew Mondo Castro (The Pin-up Girls vocalist, former Ang TV star, former NU107 DJ, currently the host of Between Planets). I had also been listening to their show religiously although, to be quite honest, I know zilch of the songs they play on the show. But the show grew on me. You learn something new every day and every Friday from then on, I was hooked. Not so much the songs, they were great, but I was actually after the conversations. It wasn’t until I read a feature on his two older siblings that I realized that I was writing to that Romulo. He’s related to the Romulo who was thefirst Filipino Secretary-Generalin the United Nations and the Romulo who was running the government when GMA was campaigning.   That Romulo.     Once in his show, when Mondo became a guest, he mentioned that I’m a nice girl who should write his columns for him. Coming from someone who’s probably read ALL the books in his room, having learned how to read as early as age three, who studied in a school I couldn’t get in twice (UP, first for college, second for law) in my lifetime (I’m scarred for life!), writes a column for one for the most prestigious papers in the city, uses words I have never even heard of, and for him to say that on  NATIONAL RADIO , that is such an honor for me. I feel very flattered. I don’t get too many compliments, especially not like that.   I visited him, along with his co-host, Mario, the Gweilo’s owner, some time in the summer. April 30, 2004, to be exact. After the show I told him he owed me a beer. He said he’d treat me right after we: 1) go to his house to fix something; and 2) pick up his fiancée. I helped him finish edit his Palanca entry. He kept on telling me he didn’t know how he’d be able to edit it without my help (page insert, delete, bold. Being the daughter of a man who owns a computer shop can be very handy). I even met his dad. I felt like such an idiot shaking his old man’s hand. He was asking me where in Quezon CityI was residing and from what district and I kept saying sorry because I didn’t have the slightest clue. I mean, how can anyone be anymore retarded than that?! I can’t believe all these rich people let me into their house when I could’ve been a psychopath, for all they knew ( “it’s okay, we have guards” ). After we submitted his Palanca entry, where once again he thanked me for being there (I lent him my pen because apparently, one can’t exactly register for the Palanca awards if one didn’t have a pen. One should also bring extra copies, three for the judges and one original – we printed five but only brought four, including the one which was supposed to be mine but ended up being submitted to the Palanca authorities anyway.  Erwin, I’m still waiting for my copy via email ), we went to the Umma Gumma’s booth at The Fort. There I met Yvonne, his fiancée (and Umma Gumma designer), and saw some of the clothes they have been selling. Erwin is a lousy seller :) Anyway, it was also the Urban Fiesta at The Fort. I met some of Erwin’s batchmates from Southridge (David Sebastian is sooo hot), a really nice girl named Corinne and I saw Radioactive Sago Project and Bamboo, the band, perform. After we brought all the clothes back to their home, we went to Gweilo’s, the bar, where we met Mario again, and Mr. Jack Daniels (I forgot his name! They kept calling him “Mr. Jack Daniels”!). There I realized how the study of law can be very advantageous. They all thought I was pretty smart and they kept saying how weird it was for one to study law and listen to rock music at the same time. Not all law students are geeks, hello?! Most law students can drink and smoke more than all the kids at Gweilo’s could.   It was around 3:30am when Erwin said that I should be going back to my dorm already (I call it dorm while my roommates call it “condo”. It is a condo unit but it feels like a dorm) so he and driver brought me back to Manly Mansion. He was (is still) very nice to me and I can’t imagine how a guy coming from a family as rich and influential as that could be so interested about my boring, mundane, pathetic bisexual life. He is very down-to-earth and friendly (I almost got introduced to Bamboo, the vocalist. SAYANG!!!) and geeky. I’m glad he’s my friend.      N. B. Erwin writes for the YStar section of the Philippine Star and is the host of the NU 107 show “the Gweilo’s Hour” every Friday. “The Outsider” is the title of his column.  062204
