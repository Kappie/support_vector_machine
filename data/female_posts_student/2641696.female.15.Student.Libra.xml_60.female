It's strange; I just don't like using the Blog Skins stuff. Doesn't feel original enough or something. Despite the fact that I can't write HTML for beans.   ei33tHirdEYe... randomness. ei, of course, you all know. CalEIgh. Rather than ie. *g* Thanks to Nith for that wonderful invention that I still use... wow, that was a long time ago. I don't even talk to him any more. It's quite sad. 3 is my favourite number, but I like 2, too, so it's a double-3. Rather than 6. Because I am against math and all that it represents. Logic sucks, and so do most numbers except for 2 and 3. Third Eye is a song by Tool, which is one of my favourite bands, and it is a damn cool song at that. Also, it means so many wonderful things -- and it looks cool. So, for the symbolism, prettiness and the fact that it proves I worship Maynard James Keenan... it, too, is stuck into the name.   The capitalisation of H, E, and Y is just for prettiness. But it also spells 'hey.' I'm not quite sure of the relevance of that, but since I only realized it when I typed "H, E, and Y", I figure it's gotta mean something. I am a firm believer in signs and omens. Weird things don't just happen to be weird, they happen so that we look twice at life before jumping to conclusions.   Anyways, I hope all of you are having a much more exciting weekend than I. Also, it's too bad, A, but I found the Ontario Ren Faire site, and it turns out to 'be entertainment' you have to send in an audition tape... like, 3 months ago. o_O So that's no fun. I won't be playing anything at the Ren Faire.    But we can go anyway!!
