I had the best idea! Or at least I think its the best. I still have to ask my mum abooot it butttttttttt  I want to make a ton of lunches every Wednesday morning and hand them out to homeless people in Portland!!! Wouldn't that be sue-wheat?!?!?!? It could be like the official Laura Summer Ministry!  *w00t*  I am SO happppy
