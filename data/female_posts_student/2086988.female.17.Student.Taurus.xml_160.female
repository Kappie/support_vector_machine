Too bad I have to wait to try out the 10 Kuma Sutra moves I learned. Ah oh well =p  Yay, I probably get to have surgery on my back. Mainly, to prevent my disc from actually becoming "Ruptured". Right now, it's a "contained herination". And he thinks that relieving the pressure from my disc will reduce the risk of me making my back worse in the years to come. So yeah, I go back in about 7 weeks and we'll decide from there. It's only a 45 minute out patient procedure, I'll do it. Though, there are minor complications that can be associated with the surgery, but they're slim. And I'd rather do this now, then wait like 10 years and really injure my back. Thoughj, I'll always have back problems the rest of my life. Sucks don't it?    And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be Than here in my room dreaming about you and me
