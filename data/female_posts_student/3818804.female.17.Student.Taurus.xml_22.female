Wow, there are some hotties at work...Came home around 8 pm-ish and ate dinner at 9 after I got done with all the crap at home. I'm leaving tomorrow for Vegas... It really didn't hit me till now...lol. I gotta pack and crap. So try not to miss me too much ok? I'll be gone till the tenth.  Before I left for work David and I had a conversation and basically I believe its over...but it hasn't started...so I don't know but were not talking "like that"  Ugh...I think the Vegas trip is in due time. I need to get away from everything.  P.S. It's too bad, I really liked him.
