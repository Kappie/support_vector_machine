It makes me feel special, in fact. :)  Non-Candid Quote Goodness:  "I'm so tired of being here/ suppressed by all of my childish fears./ If you have to leave,/ I wish that you would just leave/ because your presence still lingers here/ and it won't leave me alone./ These wounds won't seem to heal,/ this pain is just too real,/ there's just too much that time cannot erase./ When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears/ When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears/ I've held your hand through all of these years,/ but you still have all of me./ You used to captivate me/ by your resonating light/ but now I'm bound by the life you left behind/ Your face - it haunts my once pleasant dreams/ Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me./ I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone/ but though you're still with me/ I've been alone all along." -Evanescence, "My Immortal"  Roger: Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.  Phoebe: It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.  -Friends  "Playground school bell rings again/ rain clouds come to play again/ has no one told you she's not breathing?/ hello, I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to/ If I smile and don't believe/ soon I know I'll wake from this dream/ Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken/ hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide/ don't cry.../ Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping/ hello, i'm still here/ all that's left of yesterday." -Evanescence, "Hello"  Phoebe: I could be a secretary.  Chandler: Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.  -Friends  "Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a back-up plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon." -Chandler on "Friends"  "I linger in the doorway/ of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name/ let me stay where the wind will whisper to me/ where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story/ In my field of paper flowers/ and candy clouds of lullaby/ I lie inside myself for hours/ and watch my purple sky fly over me/ don't say I'm out of touch/ with this rampant chaos - your reality/ I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge/ the nightmare I built my own world to escape..." -Evanescence, "Imaginary"  Phoebe: [Right after playing a song in the coffee shop ] If you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer. -Friends  [pounding a scone]  Ross: Stupid British snack food!  Chandler: Did they teach you that in your anger management class?  -Friends  [Flipping a coin to choose between "ducks" and "clowns."]  Joey: "Heads" should be ducks, because ducks have heads.  Chandler: What kind of clowns came to your birthday parties?  -Friends  Chandler: [talking about a dog] What if it attacks me?  Joey: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.  Chandler: And that doesn't scare you?  -Friends  [Chandler's trying to quit smoking]  Chandler: Eww, Lambchop! How old is that sock? If I had a sock in my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.  Ross: Okay, I think it's time to change someone's nicotine patch.  [does so]  Chandler: [deadpan] Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.  -Friends  Rachel: Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.  Joey: You could?  Rachel: Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.  Phoebe: Your own boat?  Rachel: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.  -Friends  (I'm going to stop putting "-Friends" at the end of these because if you can't figure it out that it's from that show then that's scary.)  Chandler: You wanna tell secrets? Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!  Ross: All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!  Chandler: Ross came in fourth and cried!   [Upon learning he must move far away and commute to work]  Ross: Why, it's like I've been given the gift of time!  Chandler: That's great! Last year I got the gift of space! We should get together and make a continuum!   Monica: Dad, Chandler didn't melt your records, Ross did.  Jack Geller: Is that...  Monica: And Dad, you know that mailman you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboy's, Ross did.  Ross: Yea, well Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!  Monica: Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year.  Ross: MONICA  CHANDLER ARE LIVING TOGETHER!  Monica: Ross married Rachel in Vegas, and got divorced, AGAIN!  Phoebe: I Love Jok Custou!  Rachel: I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!  Joey: I WANNA GOOOOOOO!  Judy Geller: That's a lot of information to get in thirty seconds.   "I'm surprised that you've never been told before/ that you're lovely and you're perfect/ and that somebody wants you."-Semisonic, "FNT"  Joey: You didn't cry when Bambi's mum died?  Chandler: Yes, it was so sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!   Monica: I CAN'T STOP SMILING!  Rachel: I know, it looks like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.   [Joey and Chandler are trying to break into a closet]  Joey: Do you have a bobby pin?  Chandler: Wait.  [runs hands through hair]  Chandler: Oh, that's right. I'm NOT an eight year-old girl!  Joey: Really? Then why do you throw like one?
