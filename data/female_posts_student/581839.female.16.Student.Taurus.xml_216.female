I tried my best to leave this all on your Machine but the persistent beat it sounded Thin upon listening That frankly will not fly. you will hear The shrillest highs and lowest lows with   am i upsessed with this song? maybe. is it awesome? absolutely. should exams die? indefinately. i'm i writing too many questions? no.   anyway, this is like the third day IN A ROW that i've posted and personally i am rather proud. i mean, personally. anyway, i have to go do stuff. exam stuff.
