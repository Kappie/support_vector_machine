I want to rush up to your mom and wake her up. I want her toopen hereyes and see what her negliance had turned her children into. Yet,I'm in noposition to do that. You'reyour her daughter. There is so many choices open to you. Choose one and work on it. If that doesn't work keep on trying. If you sit back and give up, you're family has no hope, because you know that your family is in a mess, and you don't do anything, you're harming them even more. I only can do so much as to give you advice butI can't carrry it out for you. Do you really want to walk down the aisle ten years later alone?Do you want togive birth to kids who doesn't have a grandma to look after? Your parents won't be there for your greatest joy and sorrowif you don't tell them. I'm sorry to say that, I think you're parents are waiting for a tradegy to happen to realize.
