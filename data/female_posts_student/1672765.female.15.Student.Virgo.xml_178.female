Hey hey hey Brains for dinner Brains for lunch Brains for breakfast Brains for brunch Brains at every single meal Why can't we have some guts? Hey hey hey Brains are all we ever get  In this rotten fuckin' place  Hey hey Brains are all we ever get Why can't we have a change of pace? Brains for dinner Brains for lunch Brains for breakfast Brains for brunch Brains at every single meal Why can't we have some guts? Hey hey Why can't we have some guts Hey hey Why can't we have some fuckin' rotten guts Hey hey hey hey hey
