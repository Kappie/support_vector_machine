So, I was forced to do laundry yesterday. Yesterday went by surprisingly fast. Before I knew it, I was putting Nick to bed. Today is a big birthday party at my grandparents for my aunt-Sheri and uncle-Mike from Florida. Their family comes up every year and we celebrate their birthdays while they are in Duluth. I have no idea what Nick should wear ;)  More laundry to do today and I feel guity for not taking Nick on a walk for such a long time. Although, he doesn't even really  know  we are on a walk because he crashes into a very deep deep sleep as soon as we start our walk. But, either way, we are going on a walk. It looks beautiful out. Nick sleept on his  left  side last night and right now I used Pam and Daryls's advice about a rolled up blanket and it's working! Yea! I hope it's not too late.
