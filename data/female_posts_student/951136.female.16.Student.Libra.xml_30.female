I HOPE! aaaaandddd. what else? life. life life.sigh. the second you think you've put something behidn you, and you've gotten the strength to move on, it slaps you in the face and sends you back down to hell. so, there you go. thats my life. all ya need to know. i've sunk back down to where i was a month ago? and why? b.c. i'm sad, and alone the more ppl are around me. and i dont want to tel anyone else in. i just want what i had. and who and more so WHY should my freinds be there for me again? i wont be as bad. i learn from each experience. but still, i'll just shut up. but it will be in my mind. again.  i'm living in a memory i know. a memory that has no basis anymore in reality. but, thats all i have to live on. so take that you get. or the other side of my head, is telling me. you cannot have what you want, so you wont take anythign else. maybe thats why i'm feeling the way i am. thats why i'm acting the way i at to others. i dont want anyone else. and i can;t have who i want, so i dont want to get close to anyone.  this isn't healthy....
