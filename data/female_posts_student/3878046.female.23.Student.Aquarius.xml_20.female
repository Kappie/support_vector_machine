If i want to fly direct to knoxville it will cost me about 400 pounds, but if i'm willing to shlep around I can get to new york for under 200, then i could just get on a bus for about $150.  hmm me thinks I'd rather pay extra for comfort and quickness.  it would be so easy to jsut bung it on the credit card.  if i could stay with people i wouldn't have to worry about paying for accomodation so esp if i get a job this summer i can just about afford it.  i have a high credit limit and the government just gave me some money.  Am i being stupid, is september too soon to go back?  maybe i should wait till later, but sept is such a convenient time of year.  i won't have nay classes yet, all my friends will have just started, but hopefully won't have too much work, it's football season and the weather is still fantastic. Also is it Eli's 21st around then sometime?
