Sure, I may befailing multiple subjects, Imay have a six page paper due tomarrow, I may have misplaced both rents, I may have a sick feline throwing up all over house, I may have broken the scanner, it's possible I don't have tickets to freshman dance I wanted to attend tomarrow, and I may be surrounded by ladybugs [the very same that murdered Taks' parents]. But on up side, I have a Cabe who somehow puts up with me on days like this.
