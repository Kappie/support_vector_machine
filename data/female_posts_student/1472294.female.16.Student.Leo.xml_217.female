Nobody actually commented much in it and I myself hate to talk inside too... But I have 'sentimental' feelings for it, I am just so confused, so 'mao dun'... Anyway, today was a kind of fulfilling and tiring day. Firstly, I packed my stupid and condensed shelf. There were three 'storeys'. The first was for all my art work and some dusty school files, the second was for my key chains where I kept it in two mooncake boxes (I love recycling!) and the third I put all my childhood belongings and plastic bags, I love plastic bags and Popular plastic bags stand at the majority. Now you may wonder, where this Akiko keep her books and school stuff? I actually put on my study table and it will be a miracle if someone can actually find something among the 'mountians'.... I was sneezing throughout the whole afternoon while tidying up my stuff. My mother even suggested me to wear a mask... Coz I have a 'weak nose'. Ok, back to the shelf. I started about 1pm and just finished, including a 1 hr break to watch 'showbiz'. Now, everything looks more tidy. I even managed to squeeze all my sec 4's books into the shelf... Whew.
