I set my alarm this morning for 9:45 (I absolutely without question had to go to my Language Arts presentation) at noon but guess what I musta hit the off button instead of snooze cause when I looked up again it was 11:26. Shit. So I took literally a five second shower (that's 1 second to get nekkid and 4 to be 'clean') threw on some clothes and washed my face and I was gone... I was at school at 11:38. Amazing, yes??? For me that is. See I had to finish my notes for the presentation, which is why I wanted to get up earilier.. so I did them during lunch. So I gave my presentation with a sore throat, an empty stomach, and flat hair. Monkeybutt. It went well though. I think. There's no one to compare it to since we were the first group.   Fun with Billy Joel lyrics... yaaaay  Excerpt from "Only the Good Die Young"... such a good song... I can't find my fucking cd though...  They say there's a heaven for those who will wait Some say it's better but I say it ain't I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints Sinners are much more fun... And only the good die young   The Stranger Billy Joel  Well we all have a face That we hide away forever And we take them out and Show ourselves When everyone has gone Some are satin some are steel Some are silk and some are leather They're the faces of the stranger But we love to try them on  Well we all fall in love But we disregard the danger Though we share so many secrets There are some we never tell Why were you so surprised That you never saw the stranger Did you ever let your lover see The stranger in yourself?  Don't be afraid to try again Everone goes south Every now and then You've done it, why can't Someone else? You should know by now You've been there yourself  Once I used to believe I was such a great romancer Then I came home to a woman That I could not recognize When I pressed her for a reason She refused to even answer It was then I felt the stranger Kick me right between the eyes  Well we all fall in love But we disregard the danger Though we share so many secrets There are some we never tell Why were you so surprised That you never saw the stranger Did you ever let your lover see The stranger in yourself?  Don't be afraid to try again Everyone goes south Every now and then You've done it why can't Someone else? You should know by now You've been there yourself  You may never understand How the stranger is inspired But he isn't always evil And he isn't always wrong Though you drown in good intentions You will never quench the fire You'll give in to your desire When the stranger comes along.  And So It Goes  In every heart there is a room A sanctuary safe and strong To heal the wounds from lovers past Until a new one comes along  I spoke to you in cautious tones You answered me with no pretense And still I feel I said too much My silence is my self defense  And every time I've held a rose It seems I only felt the thorns And so it goes, and so it goes And so will you soon I suppose  But if my silence made you leave Then that would be my worst mistake So I will share this room with you And you can have this heart to break  And this is why my eyes are closed It's just as well for all I've seen And so it goes, and so it goes And you're the only one who knows  So I would choose to be with you That's if the choice were mine to make But you can make decisions too And you can have this heart to break  And so it goes, and so it goes And you're the only one who knows
