First off i write on myself with pencil during my math test which i aced(yay) and then i almost trip on my own 2 feet(booo) but then during 4th period my french class (im sure you all remember me ranting about Madame de Berry earlier this year) well this class started out like always kinda sucky but then She "remembered" that there was a survey for juniors and senoirs about prom that we had to do right quick so she starts talking  #1 WHo is going to prom? all 5 junoirs raise their hands including me because i was considering going because my friends wanted me too, but wasnt really planning on it. #2 Who is going with a date? and again everyone raises their hands except for poor lil ol me...yes thats right folks i was dateless dont be too shocked. Then out of the blue my teacher stops the survey looks at me and says " O i think i might know someone you can go with.) first thing that pops to mind "O lord what is this crazy lady talking about?" SUddenly Avinash pops up and runs to the door and in walks Aria with a dozen gorgous roses, and what i would call an admirable attempt to speak french he says "Chere Maddy, Voudrais-tu aller a la "prom" avec moi?"  and me pink in the face and speechless just sit there grinning and nodding my head. sigh im and such a dork. so he walks over and asks, "so was that a yes?" and I finally can speak and say yes so he hands me the roses and away he went to class. hehe after class im walkin to my locker and i have like a million people tell me congrats or ask me what i said lol how did everyone  else know before me? truly amazing so that was my lovely day and julie has a date! yaya
