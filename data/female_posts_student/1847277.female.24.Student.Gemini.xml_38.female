It'll probably take the rest of the afternoon, although I do need to get started on writing something for my India paper.   Oh, and there's always the joys of Butts and Guts.  At some point last month I talked about the fog of the funk.  Well, it has now lifted.  Finally.  So much happier.  Yay.  For once I actually feel normal and not all crazy and confused.  Sweet.    Next on Jamie's list of things to do: get over the addiction to email/IM.  I know I can do it.  Making more friends here will certainly help.
