So, we have been talking about the good old days and talking about what has happen since we all split. Let me tell you, she has defiantly grown up. Jackie doesn't know this, but, Abby and I are meeting at the mall tomorrow before I have to head down to work. Jackie has no chance in stopping us from getting together now, so she is just going to have to live with it. I also am getting pissed at her, if she calls any of my Burlington friends sluts one more time, I am going to lose it. She also has no right to keep Spinner and I apart since Spinner is the one who introduced Jackie and I. Spinner was one of my closest friends since I moved from Jonesville to Williston. So Jackie can just shut it.
