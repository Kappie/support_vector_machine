I was all set to vote for Kerry, until he kept us waiting in the hot July Carolina sun for 5+ hours.  Oh, he's still the top choice, being able to pronounce "nuclear" and all, but I think there's one thing that could turn the tide.  My vote will go to the candidate that brings back Government Cheese.  That's right, that pale orange rectangular block of dairy goodness.  Somehow much more flavorful than anything sold by Kraft, and reassuring in its solidness.  No pre-slicing here, boys and girls... you could slice it up yourself to whatever size you chose.  Now, is that Democracy or what?  The freedom to slice!  Oo, I'm getting goosebumps!  If you've never tasted Government Cheese, you may think I'm overstating its grandeur.  But I assure you, I am not!  Blessed with an aunt who received the stuff on a regular basis and was generous enough to share it with my mom, I am one of those who still longs for that mellow, slightly cheddary taste.  This was REAL cheese, not the "cheese food" that is sold package by crinkly package in the dairy aisle.  It complimented macaroni to perfection, and offset bologna with a subtle tang that simply made one beam with delight.  And "I'm not the only one" dreaming of those sweet days of Government Cheese; anyone who knows will agree.  I mentioned it to my roommate once, as we were sitting on the couch drinking beer, and he nearly fell off the couch in a moment of recognition (well, and laughter too... he'd had a few more than I).  We found a new point to bond over as we reminisced about Government Cheese.  Perhaps we should start a grassroots movement:  Americans for the Reinstatement of Government Cheese!  ARGC!  All sympathizers, let's plan a rally to announce our support for whomever can rise above the muck of policy and bring back the cheese!
