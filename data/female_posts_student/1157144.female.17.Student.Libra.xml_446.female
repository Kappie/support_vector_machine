I got NERVOUS and had good V EEE GAN food and got to swim in freezing water and not confront a drunk man and check out the hella hoes and.  Jason and Carlie need to find a hobby, maybe...  GOING STEADY?  I hear that is a good hobby.  I should try it also; BETH!  Where is my Beth?  Will you date me Beth?  WHAT?  Fine...  Betty can be a member of our sexual love triangle  Does anyone know where I can get a job this summer?  ANYWHERE at all?  The thing @ the library fell through and I would like a job, but it needs to be close (so I can walk there) and paying (if I want to volunteer I'll do it @ the Cambrian Library).  MY MOM IS AN UBER BITCH!  Lately she is just a jerk about everything, including: grades, SATs, Jobs, keeping busy over the summer, "long and short" term goals, AP classes, permit tests, etc. I am getting to a point where I might be able to sympathize with Ryan about detesting a mother...  It pains me to say it.  I would get rid of any common acronym (i.e. LOL, BRB, LMAO, etc.)  They suck and bring down the general level of educated youngsters who type on the internet.  Besides, when they become a part of modern day speaking I get really peeved off!  Like when Tracey yells out: LOL, Billy you are so funny.   I'm in for a month of hell and high water...
