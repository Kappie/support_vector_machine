It has something to do with the legs fatiguing because of last night, and then the expectation of being surprised somehow. And I'm not, so what do I do now?  I don't know what I look like this morning since Ishita's in the shower and consequently using the bathroom. I showered myself at 8:30 and realized that even though I didn't want to be up at that hour, it felt good. I still have "Vindicated" stuck in my head, and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.   I smell obsession, but how do you stop yourself in this kind of situation?  Today's going to be a busy day. I have to finish anthro reading (just a bit, though), do my laundry, perhaps, go to five hours of class, think up a thesis for that lit paper (something tells me it has to be extraordinary if I'm to do anything right), play trivia bowl, maybe go running...  I just have this feeling now, after listing all the chores, that the only reason why all these things are bearable are because of the people around me...
