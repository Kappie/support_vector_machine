I wish I knew how to start the fire. properly. I love fire. It is so warm. goddess. I have homework. Socials. oh well at least I dont have french anymore. I dont have anything against french but our teacher sucked. how can you describe someone thats indescribable?...If I could describe Illenips it woud be: mybeautifulfrenchtwin [yes that  IS  one word] one of these days I should be a lawyer, if someone says something that isn't true I will always say "yes you did " or "yup" followed by " I can prove it ." I need to get myself an interesting life. I am cold. brrr. YAY. the fire is being started!!! now I wont have to be cold. well I could always go get meself a sweater...naw too lazy...yes I am being very lazy today.I have a V on my forehead. i wish I was an animal. an animal that walks on four legs and has fur...I have always wanted to be a tiger. Tiger's are one of my favorite animals. they are so sleek.
