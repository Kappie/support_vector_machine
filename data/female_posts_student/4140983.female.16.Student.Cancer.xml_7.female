I had a nice long entry planned about various greivances, but I now have five minutes to prepare for a long, long day.  I HATE THIS TIME OF YEAR. School always makes me question everything about myself. I need to realize that I am who I am regardless of what other people think, and I KNOW that's what I need to know, but knowing the words for it doens't make it any easier to DO.
