A couple of months ago Linds yelled at me to just sit down with Becca and Phil and end it. I tried but somehow I still wanted everything to be perfect. I love trying to reach perfection and since I'm so damn stubborn I'm oblivious to what that does to everyone around me. Josh and Linds, you two are amazing with each other and everyone around you so it's our turn, and mine especially to return what you have given me, love and kindness. Thank God for both of you because Linds is right, you did offer me everything but she's also right in that I need to work it out to a finality. By the time I get home everything will be worked out, that's a promise I make to you two. This college trial period has helped. I wish I could understand, truly, everything you two are going through but I can't and rather than annoy you with trying to find out I'm going to ask you to remember this  until we're ready to try to bridge the gap btwn the worlds:  I love you two more than anything in this world  and I would give anything up for you two.  That doesn't mean that I'm throwing phil out that door and you're right, if that is the biggest problem than screw me. I've made my decision and Josh, thanks for the resolution.
