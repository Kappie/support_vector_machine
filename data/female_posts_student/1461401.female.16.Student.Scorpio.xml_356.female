Me her and mark went playing tennis at the university, and then we went and played in the fountains to cool off. It felt wonderful, and it wasn't illegal! We even got two other women and a little girl to come and play with us. Then, after that, me mark amanda ian rob tracy cassie kat and heather.... oh yeah, and kevin went to amber's house. I mean, we weren't all there at the same time, but we swam and watched "cannible, the musical" and played lots and lots of spoons. Oh the spoonage that was. *nods knowingly* Amanda and I ended up staying up till five, I think we were the last to fall asleep. And tracy played with her birthday present. *heh-heh-heh* That was so much fun. I slept from five till eleven, then I got home at one and pretty much slept till one-thirty till six-thirty. Lovely lovely one of the best times I've had allllllll summer. (except for katie coming of course) Well I'm still tired so I probably shouldn't be rambling on like this so  WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!  ~Kristin
