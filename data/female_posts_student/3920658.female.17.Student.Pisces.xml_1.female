And the two lovelygentlemen called Simon and Garfunkel that held my heart over the open fire for two and a half hour tonight. Now all I feel is bliss.   ~:~  Oh, I forgot to tell you: I'm engaged! Well, not really... But that day after all the whiskey, when I was lying ina sofa so far away from home,feeling like I could just die, my best friend My calls. Her voice made me so happy I could just fly, but I missed her so much. She told me that she had been to a party the day before and had met a girl who had gotten a "friendship-engagement" with her best friend. So My proposes to me, right there on the phone.  I love that girl, she's the best friend I've ever had. We've been looking for some nice silver rings to exchange on the big engagement-party we're planning. I love being engaged! But on the other hand, it wouldn't have been that bad if I had some guy that I could get on that well with too... But I guess I have to settle with having a good friendship relation... It's worth a great deal, that too.  ~:~  Apparently Robin, Tom's friend from up north, had added me on MSN... He cut his hair! He looks better, but I'm not sure it's a good thing if he did it just because he's so in love with Linda.He just sent me this song called "Destiny" with 7 eleven... It's so good!   I will soon fall asleep with a smile on my lips and my heart floating around on bliss. Love /Carrie
