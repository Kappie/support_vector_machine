For example: yesterday was 'I'm single now' and staring at me, today when i was talking about the walking std he told me he was std free, today when i mentioned that Jeffrey was coming to the party he started asking all these questions about him then said that 'this Jeffrey kid' is at the bottom of the list (or something like that) meaning that he gets me (IN BED!) first...which is saucy as hell...yeah, but James is saying all this stuff about how he is a huge flirt and that i'm (only) 14 so it won't happen...but all I wanna do is mess around with him...thats all...and I'm pretty damn sure thats what hes thinking too.  Okay...so Yipee for the weekend (TOMORROW IS TOO FAR AWAY!!!)  XOXO
