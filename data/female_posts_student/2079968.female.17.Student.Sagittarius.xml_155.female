All the women sounded like a bunch of cackling hens in the kitchen...it was terribly loud. My dad literally went to talk to a wall, 'cause nobody would answer one of his questions! It was pretty amusing.  We had a lovely cabin, though...  It really sucked 'cause I got sick one day. I mean terribly, horribly sick. Thank God it was just for one day though...I would have died if it were longer. We're not sure if it was the heat or what...  I took a few photos...It was really too hectic to take a lot, so I may put up a couple of good photos in a little while.  Oh, I tried to do an audio post, but my cell phone had no signal in those mountains :-/ Maybe later, just to make up for it though.  More on my trip later, see ya!
