Fascinating stuff.  We talk about play therapy next.  After talking to a colleague over lunch last week, we realized that academia is an inherently cruel world.  We are encouraged to submit our fledgling academic efforts for publication at the highest calibre journals, and then are effectively crushed when we are insulted line after line in the reviews.  "This is a fascinating topic and the world desperately needs a study in this field.  Unfortunately, this paper isn't it."  The knife turns.  These people seem to forget that they were the ones submitting the paper but a few years ago.  How did they become so cruel?  Likewise, it is ironic how this cruel world can produce such a juxtaposition of touching personal remembrances and tributes at the  urlLink website for the late John Daverio  of  urlLink Boston University .  As much as an aspiring scholar can have an academic hero, Daverio was mine.  I hope that he has found peace.   More to come...
