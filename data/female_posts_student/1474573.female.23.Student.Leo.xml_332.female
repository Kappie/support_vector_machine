Kinda like childbirth, I guess...   Highlights of the weekend:   My wonderful hubby doing almost all the work at the party, from setting up all the chairs and tables, to cooking most of the food...from making slammin' pina coladas, to never forgetting to give me a smooch once in awhile... I've said it before and I'll say it again, my man is The Shit!  hehehe  My mother driving me nutty and all my friends that chuckled along the way.  My boss showing up and meeting my father-in-law!  One is the king of the one-liners and the other is the king of puns.  Both are very funny, put them together and all hell breaks loose!  Omar and Ed playing X-Box for HOURS in the hot-ass basement.  Those two are so nerdy, I love them so!  Many of my work friends showing up, acting like their goofy selves and getting me a gift certificate to Target a.k.a. "Heaven". (YAY, TARGET!!)  Everyone sinking into the ground when sitting in the back of the yard.  I guess its still pretty muddy over there.  Whoops!  Good-ass food!  Highlight: The chicken.  I have to say, I make a good marinade!  Rich writing me a poem as a gift.  Aww, shucks.  Sniffle.  Actually, all the gifts...really, people, you shouldn't have... but hey, if you insist!  (tee hee!)   SOMEONE  (ahem) giving me a graduation card in Spanish!  YES, I was able to read it, dammit!  LOL!  A little 6 year old asking me if I'm going to have a baby.  OH, YES SHE DID!  Sigh.  You gotta love the kids, though...otherwise you'd KILL them!    The cake!  Drool!  A Sunday party means people leave earlier.  No stragglers.  How cool is that??  My wonderful neighbors helping us clean up afterwards and taking down the tent and all that.  They f'in rock!  Thank you one and all for making my Graduation party and the whole Graduation experience as a whole one of the best of my life!  Mwah, mwah to everyone!
