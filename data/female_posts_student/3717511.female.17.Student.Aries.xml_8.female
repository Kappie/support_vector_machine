This time he seemed a bit peeved and snappish. Note the "as i said" in the opening sentence...    Hi ,  As I said, I did try two helmets with coveings over the forehead. It seems that just covering the main part of the head is effective. I also make baseball caps with Velostat but abductees feel safer with the full helmets. So yes, the telepathy is coming from above and the helmets are effective.If the aliens can't communicate with you or control you for the most part they leave you alone. However, in one case an alien/hybrid derived from an abductee was sick and they still got to the abductee to take her blood. They came down and stared at her directly when she had the helmet on. That's the only documented case of an abductee being taken with the helmet on. Since then I gave polarized goggles to the abductee which we are trying now.  Email me if you have more questions.  Michael Menkin    oh silly michael, you know not how manydumb questionswe can ask...
