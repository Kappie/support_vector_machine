Our insurance agent came to my house this morning to go over some rates and stuff and go through the principles behind this "Y.E.S." program deal so I get lower insurance rates than  all of you ! Haha! Anyways. After that affair I went to school to check on my parking spot status and to see if I could get a copy of my last semester's report card faxed to the insurance office. I came up fruitless in both efforts. Oh well. I came home, had some lunch, and my mom and I went out to a few stores. I returned home once again and then my mom and I left to go to church to neaten up the flower beds and bushes and the like. I guess we were there to make the building look a little nicer for Pastor Jim's funeral on Friday. He passed away on Tuesday night. Enough sadness for one post. We worked at church for a bit more than two hours, and I swear I am still coated with a fine layer of dust from sweeping off this filthy pathway running alongside the building :P. Yeah. So I came home and I have just been chilling out, playing the piano... Stuff like that. I'm trying to break this late night habit in order to wake up early with enough energy stored up to cause my brain to function correctly, so we'll see how that goes :P.     Last song I listened to:   Army  by Ben Folds Five.    Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .    Last meal I ate:  About one half of a Whopper, a Coke, and some fries.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I missed band camp for the second day in a row :P.    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I noticed in the garden section at Home Depot that it was warmer near the plants. I thought to myself, "That is because of the numerous exothermic reactions occurring within each individual plant cell!" I guess that could go down as a biology nerd moment, too :P.    Last person I talked to:  Steph.    Favorite song today:   Don't Change Your Plans  by Ben Folds.    Favorite food today:  Tangerine sour Altoids.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Worked at church.    Funniest thing that happened today:  I was demonstrating to my brother how on my first attempt at writing this post, I pushed the little "back" button on my mouse... Except I actually pressed it and I had to start, once again, all over. That was so  stupid !
