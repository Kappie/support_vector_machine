I decided that I'm going to be indecisive about it anyway,  but I'll end up signing up, because it's my senior year of tennis, and I don't want to miss that.  So I'll hate it, but I might hate it more if I'm not in it.     I had something else to say last night, and I found it fascinating, i think it had something to do with Lola and Wonder Woman, but I can't remember now.  So I'm off to work on the yearbook.  Joyous.  I'll be back.
