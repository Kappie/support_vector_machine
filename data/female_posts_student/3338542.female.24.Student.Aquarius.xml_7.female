Let's unravel the events that lead up to this...   HOW WE RESTORED OUR BALANCE....  Sunday.  I had decided that I would be in my ex-boyfriend Isaiah's life to help him through his problems.  I really care about him and do love him, and since I am the only person that he says he has been able to open up to this much, I thought I would be his "therapist." Everything was going well until Monday, I decided to go to the beach with him.  We tried to convince his roomie "Ryan" to come along and bring his friend "Ron."  No such luck, so "Isaiah" and I went alone.   MONDAY:THE BEACH, THE LOVE REKINDLED, THE MISUNDERSTANDING  The drive was amazing, the T-tops out and nothing but the pine barrens around on this long stretch of road.  The music was playing  Jessica Simpson's song "Be".. which I love because it reminds of how I felt before and still feel now about Isaiah.  It was perfect, but I had to tell him that I couldn't just be his friend.   We kind of just tried to ignore that last comment, besides, I wanted him to regard it as a moment of extreme weakness.  You see, the night before (sunday) he had understood that I was only to be his "therapist," but it was really hard for him to separate the love he had for me romantically and the love he had for me as a person.  So my comment wasn't helping this relationship stay platonic. We got to the beach, tried to start a fire, and then failed. =)  I guess we needed better kindling. We gave up and I walked to out to the water and just started at this endless moonlight-blue ocean in front of me that seemed to touch the star filled sky.  It was beautiful.  It almost felt like God set this moment up.  I felt him walk up behind and hold me and before I knew it, we were kissing. It was amazing it felt so right and so untouchable by the flaws that all humans have that ruins what is so pure in relationships, love.  I felt like I was falling in love again...only this time it was deeper than before and the bottom seemed like it didnt exist. We went home and when we got back to his apartment, we just kissed all night and then... it happened.. we slept together, and this is where I think that I might be pregnant.  I said "don't stop" and he took it as... me telling him not to think about withdrawing...which I completely wasnt saying (we tend to have huge misunderstandings like this).. And now I think I'm pregnant.  But he promised to stay with me through it all..   THE BEGINNING OF THE HORRIBLE ENDING  Tuesday.. I wanted to see him so we had dinner.  On the way (we met in the middle of our hometowns) he was on the phone with me and told me that he had much to do: car dealership to get a car part, Laundry, and something else... (i can't remember).  This all happened in the first conversation. After about 20 mins I called him back so that he wouldn't miss the cafe because he wasn't framiliar with it.  He had told me something along the lines of being "glad that he made that stop because then he would have been on the wrong road."  Well, we had dinner, during which he told me that the day before (Monday) when i was trying to convince his roommate to come along with us to the beach, he had basically insulted me to my face.  I have to admit i as furious.. (this is a messy story so i'll skip ahead).  After dinner, I had to go home.  We kissed and said our reluctant good-byes and which point I told him that I was really upset with his roommate Ryan. We'll I had been worried about my grades suffering beacuse of the complications that had risen during my relationsihp with Isaiah.  My grades were taking a HUGE toll, but it's really because I was so caught up in trying to fix "us" that I lost my priorities along the way.  So on the drive home from the cafe, my friend called and told me that the grades were posted up.  Needless to say that when I got home I immediately went to check my grades... and its sad to say that my grades fell far short of what i wanted.  Upset and hurt and already vulnerable from thinking that at any moment he would leave me alone to handle this potential pregnancy, I jumped back in my car and headed towards his place.  As i was driving, I tried calling him several times, but there was no answer, but for some reason I just kep driving towards his place hoping that I would be able to meet him there.  I thought that he was doing the things he needed to do earlier that day...so, when i got there i found that his car was parked in front of his apartment, but he was still not answering his phone.  At this point a thousand thoughts crossed my mind (maybe he went with Ryan to the car dealership, maybe he is at the laundry facility building, maybe he is in the car with Ryan and can't hear his phone (because its very rare for him to not answer the phone).  I drove by the laundry place and realized that he wasn't there.  And then I decided to go to the car dealership and catch him there.  But i figured i would just drive back to the apartment and check one last time and hope that his roomie's car was back.     THE MESSY END  "He's got to be home now~!" i thought... So i tried calling Isaiah to get him to come out because I didnt want to see Ryan because of what Isaiah had told me about Ryan saying bad things about me...I called and called again like 2 times i think... and then he walked out the front door on the phone.  OH~ hes on the phone?? he pointed for me to park .. and when i did i jumped out of the car hoping that I would be comforted by him... Instead he looked at me and said "why didnt you knock?"  at this point i was shocked and hurt even more... i was expecting open arms to cry into .. and instead i was fed this suspicious, semi-angry question that made it sound like he was implying that i was doing something wrong by being there.. at this point i just walked away.. hurt.. and wishing that someone cared.. When he didnt even want to see what was wrong.. i turned back around and confonted him..  "WHat is wrong with you~!" i screamed... (when i get hurt and mistreated.. i cant think)..  he said, "why couldnt you just answer my question? Why did you calling instead of knock?"   i didnt even know what he was getting at but i could tell what he was implying about me wasnt good at all and this made me more furious because it was easier to be angry than hurt.  "i dont know.. i didnt want to see Ryan and I didnt think you were home."  I replied. "Both our cars were here" "no they weren't" "yes they were" "i parked in his parking spot next to your car because it wasnt here when i called you the first time, how are you going to tell me that it was here?" "when you called, i came out and you were right in front of the apartment and both cars were there." at this point i realized he had no idea that i had called earlier and shown up earlier.. when i proceeded to tell him .. he didn't believe me and told me i should have knocked.. I told him that i thought he had left to do his errands.. and he just did not want to hear me. it escalated.. and then before i knew it..  he turned on me and said. "you have to go" i was in shock. was i really being kicked out of my boyfriend's apartment for not knocking??? basically it came down to him calling the cops on me because i woudnt leave as soon as he said it... he almost put a restraining order on me.. and he never wants to see me again.. i wish i knew what he was so mad about.. because all i can think of.. is me not answering his question when he wanted it answered.. and me calling instead of knocking.. or maybe its because i wasnt being rational.. in his eyes.. but for me.. i was hurt.. i really thought i was being rational.. either way.. him being so hateful.. especially when i am not allowed to call him b/c he could put a restraining order on me.. and he can call me.. and pretend that he's having sex on the phone... when i am alone dealing with this pregnancy ..and the promise that he broke when he said he would stick around... I KNOW THIS IS NOT LIKE HIM.. i know that he hurts from something so much more deeper than this.. so as much as all my friends and family want me to hate him.. i know him better than this.. something is so wrong.. and i wish i could help.. but how can i when all he wants to do is hurt me?... Isaac would never be the type to break someone's heart, especially someone he loves... and may have gotten pregnant.. hes not the type to get mad at somthing this small and freak out about it...  something is wrong.. something is hurting him so much more than I could have ever done.. this isnt like him.. I wish i could save him from it..... But what can i do but pray...
