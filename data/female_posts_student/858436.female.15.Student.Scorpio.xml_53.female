I was tucking Annie Georgia in bed, and she was like, "Madeline, you are my favorite babysitter ever." And I was like "aww thank you so much, that's so sweet of you!" And she was like, "I love it so much when you babysit. It's so fun." It was so sweet.   Guys are so, frustrating. Like, I dunno, I like a guy a lot but I'm a loser and I am too shy to make a move or anything. The whole thing is stupid. Honestly, I don't even know him  that  well. I mean, yes, I do know him but we aren't close friends or anything. Why do I like a guy so much that I don't know extremely well? It's not for looks, even though he happens to be gorgeous. I just like him. But I don't know why, and that is frustrating.  Oh yes, The Lion King 1 1/2 is a kick ass movie haha. I watched it with Gavin and Annie Georgia. :-)
