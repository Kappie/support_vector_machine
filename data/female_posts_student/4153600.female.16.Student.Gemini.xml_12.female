I came at 7:10pm- trying to be fasionably late. Food was okay (mee, rice, fried chicken, red egg, sweet n sour fish, popia). Stayed with our own people. Richard, Kian Yung etc. all outside-drinking. We stayed inside, and chatted the whole 2 hours away. Various topics.. interesting ones. Went back around 10:15 pm.
