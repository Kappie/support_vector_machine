The best song on it I'd have to say is Only One, the sweetest song ever. Definately get this CD, it's wicked good. Way Away is also wicked good, its the first song. I'm kinda pissed off right now cuz I just got my schedule for my classes this year and I REALLY didn't want to think about school right now, I'm having the best summer. It isn't too bad cuz I'm only really taking 3 classes this year, I've got Anatomy Physiology, english, and history...Then I'm doing independent study advanced mathematics/some basic geometry/ some alg 2 that I didn't do b4. I'm also doing independent study psychology and French 4. So basically I'll be taking one French class a week and she'll give me work and I'll be reading French novels and crap like that, sounds fun (right).  I really hope there will be some cool new full time kids this year (preferably guys).  For those of you who don't know my school well theres not many people there, therefore theres not much selection with friends and guys if you know what I mean.  We've been lucky in the past but this year I don't know, people my age or close to it are diminishing and also all the seniors are graduated.  Now that I'm thoroughly depressed about school this year I'm gonna go clean.  PEACE OUT CHILLINS hahaha jk bye
