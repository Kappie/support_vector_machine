You can download "Phantom of the Opera's  All I ask of you  at  WinMX .   Try it, that is where I get most of my songs...I never had to buy any cds anymore. Although I do have the entire musical soundtrack for Phantom of the Opera. I love that musical. You should have told me...I could have burned you a copy and sent it to you today along with your gift.
