Pretty well, and for a while I considered A Big Conservatory Back East for my grad. school plans.  Then, Jay came into my life and I ran out of money and soon my thoughts of Big Conservatories Back East turned into Big Schools in Colorado or Maybe Alabama which eventually ended up being Big School in the Same Place I Already Was.    So, here I am, and according to Mizzou, being a music ed. major is mutually exclusive to being a good musician, which is unfortunate but also the subject of a different post altogether.  The more I tried to fight against that stereotype, the more I fell victim to it.  Writing papers time started infringing upon practice time and my horn became just another object in my bedroom good for hanging lingerie out to dry.  The whole situation was disappointing not so much because I used to be good--maybe even really good--and now I'm really out of shape, but because putting aside the horn meant giving up on something I considered a great love in my life.  Maybe, secretly, even more of a love than I felt for Jay at one point.  It's difficult--and kind of dorky--to explain a love affair with twelve feet of metal and tubing, but there's definitely a particular kind of ecstacy that comes with getting everything just right...training your mouth and fingers to move precisely and intricately at the exact same time...it's almost sexual, but not.  I've heard it called "making special", because it takes a special kind of person to create music.   When I gave up the horn, I sorta lost what made me special.  I lost my mojo if you want to call it that.  Another thing that made my new career choice so bitter were two sophomore horn players named Andrea and Stuart a.k.a. Satan's Minions if you're a student here.  Stuart's a hipster in the defiant way that some people are racist; his rumpled clothes are always perfectly coordinated with a tragic hairstyle and a five o'clock shadow to let everyone in class know he overslept again because he was up late organizing his vinyl collection.  I think Andrea wears enough  urlLink Hot Topic  fake fur and polyester to warrant her own fire hazard warning and although dangerously thin, she still manages to find vintage pants tight enough to create backfat on her anorexic frame.   But that's not why they're evil...it's just fun to talk about.  They're horrible, horrible people because when the announcement that I got the history TA position for this year was released, they made sure to also announce that I was pathetic and a failure for not leaving.  When I performed in competitions or recitals, they sat on the front row and kept a tally of every missed note.  If I practiced two hours, they would stay for three.  If I learned a new piece, they'd have it the next week.  Eventually, the bitchiness just wasn't worth it; for the sake of my own sanity, I just gave up and let them win.   I ended up fulfilling that ed major prophecy: 'those who can't, teach."  I stopped practicing, and after a while, I couldn't play a note.  At all.  I had lost it--whatever "it" is.   I hadn't seen the Minions for at least six months, but they gave a recital yesterday and I went just out of curiosity.  They sucked!  They sucked big time, and the best thing was, they finally knew it.  I hate that I'm gloating about someone else's favor, but...woohoo!  They sucked SO bad!  I went backstage to "congratulate" them, but Stuart had already left and Andrea was crying in a corner with our professor, so I hung back.  As they left, I noticed a piece of her music had fallen out of her bag.  It was only a copy, so I kept it to give to my professor later.  As I walked back to my car, I kept looking at the notes;  it was something I had seen before, but somehow there was a clarity to the finger patterns I had never noticed before.  Instead of seeing a blur of black on the page, I started seeing...sounds.  I could actually hear what the music should do before I ever played it.  I doubled back to the music building, grabbed my horn, and played for three hours without stopping.     Something had changed in the last nine months since I gave up in despair:  while Andrea and Stuart were worrying about passing recitals and getting jobs, they started hating what they were doing.  It was always a competition...always another struggle.   Putting down the horn forced me to realize just how valuable it was in my life as something I actually enjoyed.   Without broaching After School Special territory,  the "making special" part of my life didn't come from winning medals or scoring master classes.  It comes from the absolute bliss of knowing that perfection is just around the corner.    Andrea and Stuart:  I'm sorry you two tanked yesterday, and I'm sorry I didn't drop out of school last semester.  On the other hand, thanks for being the two biggest pricks I have ever met.  I think I had to wade through your shit for a while to figure out what I was really searching for.
