How ignorant was I to not know that so many ppl  actually , and may I stress on that word again?  actually  visited the cafe...  To feast on their glorious bowl of.... cup noodles.  We had a plasma TV and a DVD player there but there was a lack of sockets, so it was crappily wasted. There's like suggestions that ppl can post for comments and such, that they shld have for us, libria-cafe-ers [cross breed for "librian" and "cafe"]. First, the counter is too frickin' small. We were all cramped up tryin' to make milo, noodles. Second, they shld install a librians-and-customers-should-not-flirt-as-they-are-holding-up-the-queue rule. This rule is specially for Tina.  Some of the librians who work there were kinda pissed off that newbies[like me and Jinghan] get to work in the cafe too. And not to mention, unfriendly to us. Mudafukas like yourselves should get a frickin' life and stop complaning that the space behind the counter is cramp! We're fuckin' alive, we have senses and can sense that!! Doesn't take arithmeticians[?] to figure that out!!  Wait, wait, wait.... I'm not really angry, just irritated [not much difference with bein' angry, but wtf]  Blah.*sticks tongue out* wadeva!    the NFG cartoon _______________________________________________________________________________  sincerely and do-not-piss-me-off-again, ohfreak [dot] blogspot [dot] com
