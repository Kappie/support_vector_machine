Rejection is so clear to me, all they see is my open personality I will remain who I am and be who I will be For no one can change the past, but the future is under our command Although we don't realize the duty that is at hand We need not criticize or judge If only we could all just stop, learn and love The world would become a much better place to live While we too would grow and learn to give Without expecting compensation Just help others through their tribulation We all know that sometime you'll need the help of another So how about helping out your brother? Giving and receiving is not always physical, though it's how it seems It can also be emotional, as in listening to someone's hopes and dreams. If only we'd listen to others instead of spending the time thinking of what next to say Our world would become closer and more friendly day after day No one seems to know anyone else because consideration in this time is gone Soon enough there's no one to turn to because no one understands If only they'd sit and soak it in... maybe even hold your hand Everyone needs someone to help coach them through certain periods of their lives We need to make the effort before all kindness dies.
