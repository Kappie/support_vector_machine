I told him we were going to rebuild a whole lab station and everything and then make a story and make pictures and make files and photobooks and evidence cases and suspect backgrounds and newspaper articles and clippings and how letters have to be hidden along in the lab station to make it a mystery for mrs kite to solve and all the gluing and cutting and pasting and planning and how we have to write a solution page to it all, too, and well...  reaction: beD XTC (11:31:25 PM): umm.... beD XTC (11:31:28 PM): hmm... beD XTC (11:31:31 PM): but thats way too much work  XDD  and I didn't even tell him all that stuff.  just the very basics.  building a lab, writing a story, making files.  poor poor poor dear.  he tried to suggest other stuff... like writing a story or making a board game... but I told him to be creative.  hmm.  poor poor person.  and besides, can you imagine a forensics clue??  it'll be like... the instruction booklet will be a report.  the game will just be a prop.  and photographic evidence would be a pain.  and it'd be awkward.  oh, well.  I'm stubborn.  and I've put WAY too much thought into my plan for it not to be what we do.  we'll just have to fight it out tomorrow.  I have a feeling I'll be the one doing most of the work on this project.  but that's okay.  as long as he cuts out the stuff.  *sigh*  it'll be so much work!!  but it'll be SO fun.  I'm excited!  ++sunny
