I had to get up early to go to the doctor so that he could tell me that something was wrong with my toe... no really????? Do they not think maybe I knew that and  MAYBE  that was why I went to see them.. hmmm. I should be an ace in medical school. After that I helped my grandma with her records and came home to chill. Then I had my adventure with the girls. We alllooked likemodels and this is what we did:  1) Picked up Jessica and met Sarah at RSBC 2) Picked up Nikol and met Laura at the mall 3) Went to Chile's for some grub 4) Went back to the mall and Circut Cityfor some shoppin' 5)  Fell  down the stairs 6) Got some Fraps and made bets (I can make it!) 7) Dropped Laura off at her car and raced a motorcycle 8) Hung out at Wal-Mart and the stinky bathroom in Bi-Lo *Did I forget that we almost died..... twice.   That was my day. I'm always happy to be with my buds and no guys.... :)
