It has been a long couple of days filled with doctors appointments, interrogation, sleep, and thinking. After re-reading that last post, I may have sounded a little harsher than I wanted to come across as. There are people in this world I am unhappy with. I donï¿½t think I differ from any other human being in this fact. I have been led (by others and by myself) to feel or think certain things and I want that time in my life to come to an end. After realizing what I as an individual have been through, I think I can consider myself old enough and responsible enough to take means and responsibility for all my own actions. I know I have not been through everything, and I openly admit that fact! I have, however, had my share of ups and downs and I feel that I have earned enough credibility and respect to have my own idea and opinion about certain things. If I am wrong in this assumption, please let me know!  I just wanted to put in writing a little explanation of my last entry and explain myself and where I am coming from a little further. Thank you to all that have signed my guestbook, and please feel free to sign again if the fancy strikes you! I will try and write again before my adventure to Vegas this weekend, so I will see the page again soon I am sure!  Just as an extra note: My Toyota Corolla has been officially pronounced dead. There will be no attempt to revive or restart the Corolla's heart. If you were one to ride within its prestigous walls, please join me in a moment of silence for this fallen soilder. Who knows how or when it will be replaced, but let us all thank God for automobile insurance! Okay, I think I am done.
