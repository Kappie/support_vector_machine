They called themselves something different though because it was just the two of them.  They were really good.  Pete has the most beautiful eyes.....wow, had a moment there.  En Memoria, ah shit Chronic Mass, played an acoustic set.  I like their songs and everything but I'm not so sure I like the band as a whole.  That makes no sense I know but go with it.  We went to the mall after that was done cuz I was hungry and the mall has food.    When I got home I watched the Ashlee Simpson show.  She's just so cute and charming you can't hate her.  Her song "Pieces of Me," is just so cute.  I watched her on TRL today and she said she wrote it about her boyfriend Ryan Cambrera.  Which surprised me because I really like him and he didn't strike me as her type.  That boy reminds me so much of Howie Day and I think we ALL remember how I feel about Howie Day.  Everything from the songs to his look reminds me of Howie.  So I mean, bravo to Ashlee for catchin' Ryan!  I've come to the conclusion that I don't have a boyfriend because I'm too picky.  Or maybe I'm not picky, I just know what I want and haven't found it yet.  But, you know how it is when there's this one boy and because that boy exists, nobody is good enough....I don't know how many guys I've forgotten about because they didn't measure up.  God, why is life so complicated sometimes?  My life is hardly the O.C. but it would be nice to have the answers given to me for a change.  Who am I kidding?  I have a wonderful family and a butt load of friends.  I have a warm bed and food to eat.  Life isn't bad at all.  But the one thing that is missing...a boy.  And a job, but we're not gonna go there.  Why does summer always bring with it the question of one's love life?  Good-night Kayla
