Anyway, I'm about to go to Wally World, and hopefully the mall or best buy to get a couple CD's. Probably Brand New's old one, Matchbook Romance, and the Warped Tour compilation for 2004. I don't know, anyway, updates. Last night Furby got off the fone with me, either I fell asleep and didnt get his call, or he never called, but he said he would. Oh well. HmPh, I'm gonna call kitty and see what shes doing. Yah, I'm gonna do that, go look for a b/f I've made up my mind, I need to keep myself occupied instead of wishing for something that I know will NEVER happen. Might as well try to fill up the space I know only one person can fit into. Sad isn't it. Yah I know I'm pitiful, but thats ok, because I can admit it. Proudly.  gota go, gonna write an entry on em0-rampage       K@!
