IMAGINE MY DADS EXCITEMENT.. yeah. he wasnt the happiest man alive but hey i had to get my beauty sleep..  so i got ready in a record 10 minutes.. dont expect that to ever happen again.   went to my locker to get my books then wrote my sonny a letter A.M homeroom  1-3: Health- i enjoy this class mainly cause all we talk about is psychology. 4-6: Phys. Science- Notes and found out my grade! I HAVE A "B" 7-9: Religion- Highlighted and found out my grade! AN "A"! 10-12: Algebra- OMG.. i almost cried.. cause she told us we could work in groups and i was like OH CRAP cause i dunno any of the ppl in my class cause they dont talk to me. and i sit i swear.. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLASS.. so everyones desks were all huddled up and mine was all alone in the middle while i did my work by myself.. i almost cried. btw ..i have a "C" in that class 13-14: Lunch- we played telephone again. the burito looked really gross but turned out to be pretty good with sour cream.  15-17: OFF- i went to the library ..looked up some nature v. nurture and more psychology stuff. then finished writen sonnys letter and did the rest of my algebra 18-20: Spanish- BORING..
