I went everywhere, with mucho pics which will be posted as soon as I get back to San lorenzo.  I went shopping today, no Mom I didnt go crazy on the Via Condoti, BUT i could have!!!  EASILY.  My feet hurt.  Day one I decided, I had be play Roman and wear my little heels and cute outfit to tour in.  When in Rome... But no that is stupid I tackled the coliseum in stilettos, so anyone who still claims Fred Astaire is the better dancer is wrong, Ginger Rogers (good name by the way) did it backwards and in heels.  I feel tough now, but my feet are killing me.  So after hours of trampling Italy I gave in and said the next pair of flip flops  I see I am buying..... haha, then I said, wouldnt it be funny if we went into Gucci and I bought designer flops for lack of another store open.  Yeah, sure funny-   So we were walking and keeping our eyes open for shoe stores, and I was teetering around in stilettos,  but I found one store open......to be continued. arivaderchi
