I am sitting here in my pajama's sipping my coffee, and looking out at the front yard. It is a nice day, I hope Ian got in contact with Abby last night. I would really like to see those to reunited. I now need to go take a shower and I will probably go to the store to pick up a couple things, so I will post when I get back.
