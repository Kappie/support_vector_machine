But for now I will stick to 2 diminutive stories…..On to my charming tales.....  In the beginning…..it was softball tournaments. After a long day of getting down and dirty washing cars it was time to let loose at the street dance. May I mention if you’re a cop and you happen to be reading this, I was not drinking…..Ok, I don’t care arrest me, I was drinking. But anyway, Tyler came down visit Nikki and brought a friend. Anyway I was standing with them over in the street along with Alyssa and Kendra So Alyssa instantaneously hooked up with this guy. I don't recall his first name at the instant, but his last name was Price. So we’ll refer to him as Mr. Price. (I know I babble on like a moron but I have to get all these jumblings out of my head, and I’m sure this is extremely monotonous story) So Nikki and Tyler went to my car to get a coat. Blah, blah blah….hoe, also known as Alyssa was making out w/ this guy so I left w/ Kendra, who was completely trashed. So we headed over to the action in front of the bar. Right away some guys called me over. And being my shy self I was going to disregard them and keep moseying along. However, Kendra being very social pulled me back. Blah, blah, blah....I met all of em, yet I couldn't seem to remember any of their names the next day. So I was talking to the guy who called me over. He was from Bozeman, 20 and really hotttt! His name was Bubba, which I swear on even though Kendra never remembers meeting a bubba. But Shelly who was also really drunk saw me with him and verified he was a major hottie. He could even walk a pretty good straight line. So we were sitting on the bench in front of the bank talking, I’m not really sure what we were talking about. (Wow there is lots of missing details in this story!) But I asked him why he wasn't dancing and he gave the excuse that he was white and couldn't dance. I didn't really want to dance because it was the lamest country and I never even heard of any of the songs but I attempted to get him to dance. So a while later he decided it was a good song so we had to dance to it. Yadda, yadda yadda, we danced, we made-out. Good story, huh?  The next day I learned I had a 5 inch hole in the butt of my pants. Which everyone swears they didn't notice. Which I have no idea how I got the hole in my pants or how anyone could not notice it. But that could explain why everyone was checking out my butt! Ha ha ha! So please, next time I’m drunk let me know if I do something really embarrassing like put a hole in my pants! A week later my mom decided to ask me then if I was. Hello? What does she think I’m going to say? Ha I told Swenson that and he just laughed!  Anyways Story 2:  We went up to Helena again for BPA. Michelle, one of the officers was unable to attend due to the fact that she was in Japan. Jessica, the president had to sit in during the mind-numbing board meeting. So the officers had their meeting outside, we were in the mountains at this place people get married. So I got to run our meetings. Luckily we didn’t have to bore ourselves to death and got to decorate out director chairs. Mine says Jenny P. and as Seth said, you can tell a cheerleader decorated it. After dinner all the old bats thought it would be fun if we went to the carousel. We were all very against this at first. But the officers ended up riding it like 3 times. Swenson and Mrs. Crosmer even rode. The rest of the old bats just watched. So anyway none of that had anything to do w/ the main story. But BPA has been so fricken fun so far, yet a TON of work. I had to take minutes since Michelle wasn't there. It was 6 pages and we only talked like 2 hours and we were there 2 days. OK back on track. None of that had anything to do with the point of the story. So Jessica’s mom came up and she said she was really tired so she was going to stay w/ her mom instead of jen and I. So we got our own room! Yayyyyyyy! So jen had kept in touch w/ one of the Decca guys and called him up and we went swimming, him, Seth Jesse, jen and I. Well I sat in the hot tub till I got throne in. The Decca guy left because he was going out to party. Seth and Jesse came to our room and ordered out pizza. But both were really tired because he had been really hyper all day and killed so much energy. So they went to bet around midnight. At like 12:30 Seth called and he was so fricken dead but he wanted me to listen to Jesse snoring. I felt bad for him but was still really hyper. Ok, must focus on story! So jen and I called the deca guy and told him he should come back which he did but couldn't stay long. Due to the fact that I was still bouncing off the walls (that is a damn good song) I needed something to occupy me which resulted in him calling one of his drunken friends on the phone so I could talk dirty to him. I must have a major slutty voice when I want to. Anyway this guy, Cory was really into my voice even though he didn't know who I was. However, he did know the other jen because she had met him the week before when she was in Helena. After chatting awhile he mentioned that he could be there in 10 min. if I wanted him. And the decca guys was all freaking out saying how drunk he was and he would probably try and rape me. But anyway I told Cory I couldn't sleep with him because the Fergus advisor was next door. I have no idea what floor Swenson or anyone else was on. Mrs. Fiedler lives in Helena so she didn't stay there. No one really told us what time we had to be in our room. We just did whatever. Earlier I had found out that you can't take the stairs to get to the main floor, you end up outside in the walking mall and I couldn't figure out how to get back to the front, and the doors lock and you can't use a key on them, that and they aren’t numbered. Plus I later found out there is a crazy old drunk in the walking mall at night. After some time they called and said they were done there and I went down to let them in. The guy at the desk was on the couch watching TV and totally looked at me but I just kept going and went outside, but they weren't there so I waited then went back upstairs. The deca guy calls them and they said they had beer and went around the block to get rid of it. So I went back down and the guy once again looks at me really weird, which could be due to the fact that it was 2 in the morning. Yet, they still weren’t there. But there was this guy dribbling a ball. So I went up to him and asked if the was Cory. Here I’ll put it in dialogue for ya! "Are you Cory?" says jen all perky "Um no, I'm not" replies the stranger "Are you looking for a Cory" "Yeah, this guy Cory was supposed to be down here" says disappointed jen (ha that rhymes) "Oh I’m sorry" says stranger"So what are you doing down here at this time of night" asks jen still very perky "Oh I'm waiting for my girlfriend to get off work." replies the stranger "But if you want I can be Cory" "That’s alright I think ill go back inside and see where he is" replies perky jen  Once upstairs I become conscious of the fact that I am a dumbass and that he had the notion that I was a hooker. Which Jen and Decca guy thought was hilarious and I just felt like a moron! But anyway we called to see where the hell they were and come to find, out they were at the wrong holiday inn. But anyway Decca guy had to go. But they still came. There was four of em. They even brought their beer up w/ em. Cory and one name Jake were pretty cute and they were only 19, which is an age improvement. Don't worry I didn't make out with any of them. Anyway they stayed and chatted for awhile then left to go party. I managed to get 2 hours of sleep. Turns out the Fergus advisor could hear us when she was awake; luckily it was just Seth and Jesse then. But I guess she sleeps pretty heavy and didn't hear anything afterwards. I think Swenson might be a little irate if he knew about this time. At camp it was fine because I snuck out to a cabin full of guy officers. But this time I snuck drunks’ in.  So the morale of the story is don't be out on the avenue in Helena exceptionally late.What happened to me being all timid? Dang I have tainted so much. Customarily I would never even look at a guy let alone say hi to him. Now I’m chatting to strangers on the phone and on the street. What has this world come to?  Ok, so the point of these two exquisite chronicles is that I have transformed into one of the Denton hookers. The people I loathe foremost. The anecdotes seem moderately inoffensive, no sleeping with six different guys in one night. But these stories were chosen because well I’m not about to type everything I’ve done this summer….. Anyway, I can’t believe how tainted I am. I used to not care if I went and hung out at night; reputation was such bullshit to me. I didn’t go to prom my freshman year for the reason that I could have cared less about it. I never even had second thoughts about it.  I had my hair chopped off today, just to symbolize that I do not give a fuck anymore about what anyone assumes. All last spring everyone kept influencing me not to slash my locks off. Well today I woke up and realized I didn’t care what anyone else thought. My cousin is a beautician and did a tremendous job. Except she wouldn’t cut it off as short as I wanted it because she was apprehensive I was going to be remorseful about, due to the fact that it was extremely spur of the moment.  I miss being outlandish all the time and not caring what I do. My cousin who will be a sophomore, her and I are such frenzied freaks and used to do the weirdest things. One time she threw a toothpick out the window on the way home and after driving a mile I decided to turn around and make her go obtain it. I said she was littering, even though it was biodegradable. Ok, sounds uncanny. However, we were amazingly amused. Tonight it was 60 degrees out and we decided to stick a sprinkler under the trampoline, like when we were little. Her sister, who will be a junior, was to cool for us. Oh, what boredom can do to you!  Ok, I have to stop typing since I have to get up early and work. Which I get ghastly wages, yet I need the experience. I do apologize to whoever is reading this. I believe at the beginning of the four pages, I stated that there were only two short stories. Now, I’m off to visit mia...............
