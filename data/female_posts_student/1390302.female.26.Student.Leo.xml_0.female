Write a journal entry about it.  It would be easy to say that I realized I was an adult when I graduated High School or turned eighteen, though it would be a lie.  As I look back and consider the events of my life thus far, I would say that I realized I was an adult not when I married for the first time but when I divorced.  Divorce is something that marks you, something you remember for the whole of your life.    When I was a sophomore in high school I started dating Mike, it was August 94.  He was a good guy, and we really enjoyed one another company.  We had a good time together, he started living with my family -his parents were divorced.  We spent a good deal of time together, which eventually lead to our first big fight in December 94, only four months after we started dating.  This of course led to years of fighting, nearly non-stop.  We had several good years together, got engaged in February 96, graduated high school in May 96, and began to plan our wedding.  We got married in July 98 and as I look back now I realize that it was the worst mistake I have ever made.  When the day came, I did not want to do it, yet I felt that there was no going back so I closed my eyes and jumped.  We began to fight almost immediately, and after the wedding he hit me several times.  I put a stop to that, yet we were still living with my parents and we were pretty unhappy.  I had just turned 20.    In November of 98 we began looking for a house, still not getting along yet feeling that we would be more settled and content if we were on our own.  I didn't want to buy a house, Mike did.  I wanted to rent an apartment, he said no.  So we bought a house in December 98 and moved in around Christmas time. The fighting did not even come close to stopping.  Immature as I was, immature as he was, the fighting went on.  Many late night fights later I told him that if something didn't change I was leaving by June, it was January 97.  Nothing changed and I met someone new.  No, I didn't leave Mike for Matt; I left Mike for my sanity and piece of mind.  Matt was there for me and we forged a bond.  Mike had caused me years of therapy for problems that he caused me to have, I just couldn't take it anymore.  Mike and I divorced in June of 99, 11 months after our wedding, one month shy of our first anniversary.  It was a fight from the world "divorce."  He refused to let me go and I refused to allow him to make me stay.  Two weeks of pain ensued and when it final bell rung, I was free of him forever.  He paid for the divorce and I moved to Texas.  I don't remember crying once; it was all a big relief to be through with the fighting and pain that he had caused me for the 5 years we were together.  No, I take it back, I cried once.  It was not because I was sad that we wouldn't be together anymore.  I knew instantly that I was that I was depressed that though I knew when I married him that I didn't want to, I had forged myself into one of the hoarding masses of divorcee's; I had turned myself into a statistic. In 1999 42% of marriages ended in divorce, I was just one of the 42%.  It was a real eye opener.    Bam! Adulthood, not an easy transition from the immaturity of childhood to the fully awake realization that you're an adult and there is no one there to catch you.  For me it was as if the safety net that are parents had been removed, replaced by a million-foot drop to the oblivion of the years ahead.  Suddenly everything looked so damn different and I told myself that I would never marry another man, so help me God!  I moved to Texas and in with Matt.  1,500 miles away from my family, I was an adult.  Matt had made it clear to me that he didn't believe in marriage, I had told him that was good because I would jump from an airplane with no parachute before I would tie myself to another man with a little gold band and a rock.  I just wasn't for me, marriage I mean.  Welcome to adulthood.  I was wrong yet again, Matt and I married in February of 2000 and we have been married for nearly four years. He and are very happy together and we intend to be for a very long time.  So, while my adulthood came with a price tag that was more than I had bargained for, I lived, most of us do.  I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone, though I can't help feeling like tough experience forge us into better adults.   ~Kristyn
