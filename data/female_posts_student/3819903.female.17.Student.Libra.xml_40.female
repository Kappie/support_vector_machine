But today was a 'lets write" worthy!  So, this morning I was supposed to wake up at 7:15 and be at Butler Fields at 8:00.  I also had to pick up Luter, and get at the Umpiring Job on time!  Well... If you know me well, you'd realize by now, that I didnt get there on time...nor did I wake up before I was supposed to be there!  So, luckily Kate called at like 8:10, and I had enough time to get up, put on shorts and a shirt, and head out the door... surprisingly getting there 6 minutes after I woke up!  Thats good time!  So, myself being a little groggy, and a bit on the hungry side, I made it in time for the first game that started at 8:45.  These games were fun!  Kate, Eisenach, myself, and Erin from South, umped 2 different games.  This tournament was U-9 and U-11 Girls Blazers... It was cute! There were some good girls on the teams... but there also were your fair share of bad ones--who had crabby parents attached at their hips!  I called out a girl, who was on base, for leading off before the ball was released, and I had her mom on my ass, saying, "What was that?" "They haven't done that all year and NOW you call them out?"  "Jeez they're just 11 yrs old!"  And my response was "Its in the rules, No leading off before the ball is released!" Then I waved the rules around so she could see...and she replied with: "Well it would be nice if we got those once in a while!"  So...First of a couple bad encounters at my 6 Hour stay at the Butler Diamonds!   That sucked!  6 hours of standing, walking, getting bitched at, bending over at the waist to pick up balls that rolled by... WOW!  That was somehow... tiring!  But got $25 out of it...so I guess thats more than what I had before the day started!   So, in the midst of this three game rucous.... Kevin had been trying to reach me...but...I was umpiring--so it made it a little hard to get back to him!  So we planned to go hit the range around 6...and then see where it would take us from there!  Well, we explored all over Waukesha County!  So the range at Willow was fun, and I hit the ball mediocre...but hey!  So then we decided that Pizza would be delish...but where?!  Apparently he had some place in mind... Albanese's.   Had never been there before, and we chowed down and had a grand ol' time!  after our dinner on the porch, we headed on over to the mall... to walk around...and the only store we went into...was Hot Topic!  Thats wierd!  So, with my amazing genious, I had the idea of hittin' the caffeine!  Starbucks!  He had only been there once!  No one can die before going to Starbucks... It's just one of America's great Attributes!  Damn... Tall Caramel Frappacino!  And a Strawberries n' Creme for the young man!  Well as we devoured our Caffeinated Desserts, we kept naming off movie lines... some great ones from Scarface, Super Troopers, and of course-- Tommy Boy!  Wow, cant go a day without accidentally, or purposely saying a line from the great film!   "Richard...Who's your favorite Little Rascal?  Alfalfa...or Spanky?!"  As Tommy finds Richard whackin it to the "hot" girl in pool.   "I wonder if she goes out with one of the Yankees!?"   "I wouldn't Know!"-- says Richard.  Wow,  like I needed to keep going in this "monologue," everyone knows it!  But hey, thats what we did all night!  It was a great time! So after his second trip to Starbucks, we headed back to Legs' household to p-l-a-y some video games.  Goldeneye007, for the one, the only, Nintendo 64!  The original 3D Package!  So...I officially suck!  I thought I might have a chance, seeming as though I had played it alot with the bro...but No!  I sucked that game up!  And we retreated to some normal everyday cable television!  I introduced him to the movie, "Indecent Proposal."  Man, its Robert Redford being a Shady, Creepy old man who wants some sex from Demi Moore!  Eww...But good plot!   Then I came home!... And almost forgot my clubs in his car! But I didn't!  So tomorrow... WOW!! Should be a grand ol' Time!  Dave Matthews Band Concert in East Troy, with Tom, BJ, and Kate... Damn, can't wait for the second hand Pot!  Just Joshin!  Guten Tag ( shit that means Good Day!)
