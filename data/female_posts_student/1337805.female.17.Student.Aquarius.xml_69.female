Oh man....It's super addciting, and I'm really close to getting new levels and everything....It's rather sad how excited I get over it. I've also been looking at my clothes and colors laterly, and I'm either turning into a prep, or a punk. I'm scared. I dunno why, but I just am.  Made mom a list for stuff I need back to school....Clothes are on that list, so hopefully I'll gain a bucket load of nice new things. I need them, after all. I only have about 5 shirts I can wear in the winter, and that's way too little.   Also need a job so that I can set aside money for Seabeck next year, and my travels to calgary. A real job mind you, childcare isnt going to far. Unfortuantly.   Blech! Must..play....tycooooooon!
