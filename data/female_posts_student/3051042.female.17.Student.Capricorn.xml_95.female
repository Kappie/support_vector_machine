Went shoe shopping with mom. Got new shoes. Went to Andrea's open house with Michelle. Got Madeline's number. I got the hook up on certain places I can buy certain things ;-P. Dropped Michelle off. Came home. Did laundry. Took a shower. Went to hang with Q and crew at the TI building at WCC. Came home. Ate and watched TV. Danced around like a geek. Went to Jimmy Johns for the first day of work. Stared at Steve too much. Work was alright. I wish I was actually and interesting person. Oh well. Jimmy Johns is going to be weird... but I think I'm going to like it. But I just never pictured myself as being the girl behind the counter at the register; smock, hat and all. It was alright. I wish it were busier but oh well to that too. I'm going to bed now because I have work in the morning.
