Taking him to Foreign Cinema where IBM dude once took me to. It should be a nice charming time. Oh does cake comes with my treat???  Go Harvey, it’s your birthday.  We’re gonna party like it’s your birthday.  We’re gonna sip bicardi like it’s your birthday. We don’t give a FUCK cuzz it’s your birthday. Lol, Happy Birthday Harvey.
