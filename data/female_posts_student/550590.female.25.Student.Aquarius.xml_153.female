I'm taking 18 credits, working 10 hours a week, and doing 14 hours/week at my internship, not to mention that I've been trying to get Bruce moved down here (he finally got his apartment today!) so things have been a little...hectic. I still haven't gotten the house unpacked or any decor put up, and Nadine is coming from Germany next week. I haven't even had a chance to read anyone else's blog in the past 2 months. But I do miss you guys, so email when you get a chance. That really is the best way to actually get in touch with me. My response may be short and somewhat nonsensical, but at least you'll know that I really do care. :)  School is really nuts, especially now that we've hit that midsemester point when all our papers are do. I have like 30 pages to write this weekend. It's really not going to be a fun time.   Congratulations to Christy and Jason who got engaged last week (it's about damn time!) I'm going to be a bridesmaid twice in the next year...does this qualify me for always a bridesmaid never a bride?   Well, I just got done with a 12 hour day at UCF, and Bruce and I are going to dinner, but I did want to let you all know that I am, in fact, still alive.   Love, Dannie
