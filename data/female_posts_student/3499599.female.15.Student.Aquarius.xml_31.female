If you ever saw Invader Zim, Foamy is like Gir..just as spastic..just as high-pitched...only with a very..dirty mouth, and twisted sense of humor ^_^ How could I not love it?  Sooo. Stuff that's been going on lately..  Aaron came over yesterday for the day..'twas fun. It's always fun when my seperated-from-birth-sibling comes over. Yay! It's also lossa fun talking to people his buddy list that I don't know. Finding out afterwards that I actually know some of the people..well..so far, it's only happened once. e.e; I didn't technically know the person..but..when checking our symphony's end-of-the-year-picture, we were right beside each other and..after finding that out, we still had no clue who the other was..and..that was just a really freaky coincidence. Moving on.  Oh. I've gotten off my AoM rush. After having a conversation like this at the end of a game, y'can kind of understand why..: My opponent: gg Me: (I had just forefeited) That was not a good game. It sucked. You rushed me before we were even five minutes into the game, and I had to make do with the few resources I had for an hour. My opponent: lol Me: (After games, I always seem to get hit on..so..) Don't you dare hit on me, either. I'm pissed off right now. My opponent: o, so u r a girl? how old r u? Me: AGGGGHHH  So..too much testosterone + too much stupidity = overwhelming of the Megan to the point where she can't enjoy her game of smiting people anymore.    Bleh. I don't like stupid people.  Let's see..  I've been pretty bored. Nothing's going on this week. My Mom's gone to meetings a lot, but we're probably going to go to Raleigh on Friday (which means P.F. Chang's for me...YAAAAAAY..I   I have been downloading music like crazy today out of pure boredom. I go to Smartpunk.com and find some bands I've never heard of that have interesting names..then download 'em. It's fun. heheh. I just have..very weird tastes in music.  enh. I feel like my summer is being wasted. I have a huge music theory book I should be going through, but I keep procrastinating. I should be practicing violin, but..again..procrastinating. I should be playing more tennis...I shouldn't be playing so many games...I should be working on ideas for the literary magazine...I should be doing  something!  But no..I just sit at the computer and watch flash videos or read bash quotes >  I've always had a very bad habit of forgetting journals and long-term projects. bleh.   Enough complaining. I'm gonna go play some games and scare people on Yahoo.  Song for today: Puttin' On The Ritz by...I have no idea. It's a really good song, but I found a version by the Taco and by They Might Be Giants and it's the same..so..somewhere, along the lines, this song got mislabeled..enh.
