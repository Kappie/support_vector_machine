I'm in IPT right now...The school computer network system thingo has crashed so the due date of our IPT assignment is postponed. =oD  Convenient. We have an IPT lesson  tomorrow, so I shouldn't get too excited. >oP      Rubberneckin' Version 2 is up! I'm so happy! But I still need a donut. I'm  this close  to going insane. "I must get a Krispy Kreme donut before I too go totally mad. ..Too late." I  looooove  Puss In Boots.      How does orange look on pink, by the way?? I'd better wrap this up now- the bell's gonna go soon.      Useless Camille Fact #520: My posture sucks.
