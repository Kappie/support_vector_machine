Daniel Defoe's  Moll Flanders . Defoe is an early 18th century English writer who didn't begin writing his major works until he was 60 years old. This gives us all hope, literary-hopefuls. Anyway, I think I am becoming notorious (in my own mind) for reading books by authors that are not their most famous for the first time. I say this because you may recognize Defoe's much more popularized book  Robinson Crusoe  (which I have never read). And this is the first time I have ever read Defoe. I have so much to catch up on.  Free Fall  was great. It's one of those books that demand a second reading to understand a great deal of it though.
