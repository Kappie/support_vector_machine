Hoyers and then to CVS to get some visine bc my eyes were sooooo bloodshot from the beach, and then we went back to NIcole's and i called my dad to let him know i was stayin over, yea tht was real fun... then we "debated" online w/ this kid who called Nicole's friend alex a spicanigger so obviously Nicole and Dani were offended and like then he called Dani a spic and yea needless to say the next two hours we were arguin w/ tht racist bastard... im soooooooo glad dani went out w/ Tory NOT him... we just hung out talkin for awhile and then we got really tired hehehe for some "unknown" reason lol, and we went to sleep and woke up @ like whenever it was late and my sis was supposed 2 pick me up 2day and like she called like 20 minutes later sayin the car wouldnt start!!!
