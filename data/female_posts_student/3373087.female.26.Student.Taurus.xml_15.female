I'm glad that Dr. Cliver is one of the very few teachers at school who actually curve grades.  So all the tears and freaking out were for nothing--what is God trying to teach me here?    1) I shouldn't freak out about something that I don't know for certain yet 2) Grades are WAY too important to me--just look how I overreacted.  I haven't cried that hard since I watched "The Yearling" and I'm not even PMSing (I don't think). 3) What's ultimately important is not my grade, but how well I can apply the material. There's a spiritual lesson here too... 4) God is full of surprises and reminders that He is still in control.     B is going to ask his dad today about the possibility of going to Oregon for the first 1.5 weeks of our vacation.  The first time I looked into this, I really had my hopes up.  Now that the door has possibily opened again, I'm trying to be careful not to raise my hopes again.  I think it would be awesome to go so we can spend time with his parents.  Most of all, I think this will give me a window into his high school/college life. B has told me a lot of how he spent those years, but I think that meeting his friends and going to the places he used to go to will give me an even clearer picture of that time in his life.  In a sense, those 10 years are still kind of a mystery to me and visiting Oregon will bring more "temporal continuity" to the person I know now.  It would be awesome to meet Pastor Kurt and Tom, and spend time wtih his folks--people who have influenced him a lot over the years. It sounds strange, but I feel like I owe them a lot for the way they have helped to shape B into the amazing person he is.  I just want to shake their hand and bake them cookies or clean their house or something.... I don't sound like I'm getting my hopes up do I!?!? =)
