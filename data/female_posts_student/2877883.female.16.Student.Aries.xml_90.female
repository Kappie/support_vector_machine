So, I ran down to the front door and tried to leave the house and run home but the door was stuck and it wouldn't open.  So I kept trying but my arm got all crampy and didn't have energy to open the door.  So then it got really cold and I had to take one of her awful awful sweaters from the hall closet and put it one.It was an actual one she wears that is orange and blue and every color. So then I finally got the door open and ran home exhausted and I took the sweater off in my laundry room in the cellar and put it on the dryer and I noticed that she had never taken the price tag off and it said SALE $49.99 from Marshalls and then I woke up.  It was the scariest and most vivid dream I've had in a very long time.  I remember the whole time being scared that she would see me.
