My mom and my aunt had an argument over baskets that are being made for a raffle/fundraiser. Get this...it's in OCTOBER. And they're already fussing bout it. We were @ Casa G for my satanic cousin's b-day. *If he passes 8th grade, he'll be a stupid freshman when I'm a junior! HAHAHA!!!! He's so goin down* I laughed so hard when the ppl came singin to him. good times good times. O yes. HAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWW! HHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWW! don't ask me, ask Betsy or Maddy. h/o... ok. I had to get up and do the old dude dance from the Six Flags commercial. It's like mine n Betsy's tradition now. It's good exercise too. SO GET UP N F-IN DANCE ALREADY! GRRRRRRRRRR! hehe. jk y'allz. Dude...I found out that after I left the party, they played team air hockey again n played hide-n-go-seek. I was kinda disappointed I wasn't included. Then again, only a few ppl were left in the end. *obviously* I'm gonna have my own party on the only possible weekend I can! SECOND WEEKEND IN JULY! *I still have to get approval from the mama* Well, since I've had nothing to eat like almost all day n since I'm tryin to finish this song I wrote *it's hott*, I'll c y'allz tomorrow.
