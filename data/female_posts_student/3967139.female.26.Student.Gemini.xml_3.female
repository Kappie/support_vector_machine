I just wanted the same cut I had but a little shorter, not too difficult. Or so I thought. All of the sudden the top layer of my hair is 3 inches shorter that it had started and the back didn't change, leaving a long layer that flips up. It is like a mullet gone terribly wrong. And she thinned it which I specifically asked her not to do. Fortunately my sisters will help trim the unsightly back so I wont have to wrap my head in a scarf to go outside.
