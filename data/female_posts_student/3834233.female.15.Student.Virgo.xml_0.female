I MISSED HER!  yes, well, work again this morning. dull, boring, slow, agonizing etc. nothing special. i was so bored that I was spending my time coloring pictures and calling the radio station I was listening to. I almost won tickets to a John Mayer and Maroon5 concert! I was caller 23...you had to be caller 25 to win. grrr, so close.   my grandpa is funny. my favorite quote from him so far is: "little kids are nice when you can pat them on the head and then they go home." LMAO. well said, grandpa, well said. haha...well I think its funny. he picked me up from work today...but he was 20 min. late cause he got lost. haha, its all good. =P   well i feel like im floating on a cloud. and no, not DRUGS, i am just so happy that Tegan is back! AH! im happy. hehe. it sucks that she is leaving again on monday. oh well, i survived a whole 10 days, i can do it for only 6. (um, i just reread this and it sounds kinda dirty...haha, sorry bout that. maybe its just me)  anyways, i am gonna go i guess. nothing else really happened today. just, like, wonderful family time *rolls eyes* actually it wasnt that bad. it was kinda fun. haha..bored games, photo albums...so now im going off into more boring crap. haha, so thats my cue to go ahead and wrap this up before i just blab on for another 3 paragraphs. haha.   k, well, nite! love, peace and chicken grease. *muah*  ~Miranda  ps...ya know? i personally think it would be a good idea to leave a comment. think about it, you could be the VERY first one EVER to leave a comment on my fantastic blog. like, people 10 years from now can look back and see your name as the FIRST comment and be like "hey, that person is my hero." just a thought...but do what u wanna do. =P
