       
      Finished a rough draft of my Letter of Intent this morning.  Why are those things so difficult to write?  I suppose it is because they are so personal in nature.  No one likes examining themselves in that light.  Sort of like a job interview on paper.  I'm going to do some chores this afternoon, cleaning, sorting of recycling for tomorrow's city collection and so on.   "Normal" stuff for a change.  I can't believe my break is almost over, though.  Very depressing.  Poor Nova Scotia got hit with a major snowfall.  Had to declare a state of emergency.  Fingers crossed that what's coming our way tonight and tomorrow won't amount to much.  More to come...
