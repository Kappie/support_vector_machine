I'm actually typing this but it's coming out in white... freaky, it's cause I type too fast. Plus the fact that my computer's probably had some weirdness rubbed off on it over the years. Yow it bit me! (See what I mean?) Oh, it's slow cause I'm copying a Goldfinger cd, hmm... maybe I should not do any thing while it's doing it so I don't anger the computer... Nah! Eeek, I'm going. It's kind of freezing then unfreezing at the moment! Bubi!
