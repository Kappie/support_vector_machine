So I thought I'd list the things to see why I was feeling what. Ok -ve things: *missing Rachel *feel so child-like in the way I react to things *feel lonely *have got to see CPN tomorrow *folks at Navs seem so apathetic about somethings - they appear super holy but then don't put it into practice (ok this is me probably being really harsh and I totally understand if you think I am a bad person but I did promise to be honest on this blog) *if I don't contact friends then they don't contact me *don't know what to do about Tanzania  so now I will try and think of all the good things to try and remind myself that things aren't that bad: *my church is going to become a fairtrade church - yipee! *I got an email from Mel which made me feel good *I did lots of work this afternoon *I played the piano with my friend Lizzy  Apparently everyone can think of 5 good things that happened that day to thank God for and its a good exercise to do, because even when things are really rubbish you can often think of 5 things - although I can only think of 4 tonight!  Well night night everyone
