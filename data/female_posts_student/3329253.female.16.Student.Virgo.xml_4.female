A lot and you know what? I don't have to do a math portfolio because I'm not in IB math - haha I've disappointed so many people with my not math IB-iness.  another thing. Math is hard to do without a graphing calculator. Mine broke... Twice. haha maybe I should stop abusing it. haha well the first one I didn't break - the second one I did break. But that's beside the point... I still need a graphing calculator to study for my midterm - unless I can do a whole bunch of math tonight and then graph stuff tomorrow afternoon (double math) and then hope I do well on the midterm... *ahem* 3/4 term test. haha you know what's funny?... Nothing that's what!  Oh yea I made a funny. Anyway I have to study for math. Bye bye! (where would I be without spell check?)
