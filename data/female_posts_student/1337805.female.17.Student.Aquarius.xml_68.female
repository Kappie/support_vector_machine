Isnt there a cheese, cabbage and fruit drawer? Then why doesnt it go live there? Huh? Huh? I need to go find some bread....Maybe I'll find it in the meat drawer. Or in the cereal cabinet...  I just had a fight with someone over the size of a freaking mountain. Now, to prove I'm right, I need someone smart to tell me where the highest point in victoria is, not just saanichton, but victoria, and where the hell Mt.  Newton is, cause seriously, the Newton I'm thinking of is a Calgary mountain! A mole hill!  Oh jeez....Where is my man to restore my sanity?
