Other then the breath taking performances by Tom and Anne, I wanted to shoot myself. As Norman said, this thing is an hour and 30 minutes too long. It was funny. I was incedibly angry that i wasn't asked to be in it. I'm MAINSTAGE MATT! But I was quick to be thankful i wasn't in it. As my drama teachers have said, we are profesionals. The actors they had were like robots, with no character. I don't want to insult them, I mean, not many people have the courage to do that, and in such short amount of time, but it was far from good. Did it need to be good? No, but Mainstage has given me a bad character where I have to point out all the flaws of acting. I don't mean to be a jerk, but I'm blaiming mainstage. But yeah, Anne was funny, she was like soooo stuck up self absorbed girl. You could totaly buy that. Tom was funny at times, but you could tell he had memorized the lines and he was saying them by memory. He wasn't saying them naturally. But yeah, good times.
