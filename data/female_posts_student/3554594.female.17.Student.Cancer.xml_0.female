And understand the truth that is deep inside my heart.  I know I am not perfect, I'm not going to lie, But I try to be the best lover I can be.  You raise me up, Even when I tear you down. Your words of wisdom,  Build my confidence.  I know the beauty that lies inside of me, It's an understanding that comes from the beauty within you. The beauty you share through your touch and your eyes
