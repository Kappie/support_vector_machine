Well, atleast for the Weber side of the family.  The Persons' aren't huge partiers.  They're more reserved.  Now, my mom's side whoa they know how to party and hard.  Alcohol is always around.  But not only am I underage but I'm also straight edge so I wouldn't do that anyway.  I don't think I have to quote Minor Threat.   I don't see why someone would drink or do drugs when they know the consequences.  That's just not me.  But I still like to have a good time and my mom's side is really good at providing a good time.  I'm a strange mix of the two can't you see.  Sometimes I feel like I don't fit in with either side.  It doesn't really help that I'm in the middle on both sides either.  I think I'm destined to be in the middle all the time.  I mean I'm the middle grandchild on both sides and the middle child in my family.    Ashley's reception is on Saturday, I believe and I don't know when Kate's is.  I like the reception the best because you get to see how they decorate the garage normally with all the things they've done in school.  The things from when they were really small like in elementary school is the best because it is always so cute.  Watertown's graduation is the same weekend so it will be interesting to see how certain family members juggle that.    I realize I'm rabbling about graduation but I have nothing else to talk about because I didn't do anything the past few days that have been worth typing about.  Honest.   Well now you've learned that Kayla is straight edge but I'm sure if you know me you've figured that out.
