Friday Daniel brought his neice, nephew and one of their freinds over to the house (they are 3, 7, and 8). They had an awesome time swimming and things in the lake. Then I went back with them over to their house and ended up staying the night over there becuase mom never got home. I didn't sleep very well but somehow I had enough energy to get up at 7 to go to a car wash for swim team. So I went to the car wash only to be told that we weren't even going to be washing the cars. We handed out free tickets to some car wash down the street and asked people for donations.A radio station was there and some freinds got to go on the air. It was pretty cool but it was so hot outside that we were all miserable. Basically we were standing in the sun for five hours holding signs, jumping up and down, and screaming. Lastnight I almost lost my voice. We had a good time for being so miserable, it probably could have been worse. Oh well, we raised a ton of money. I got burnt a little but hey maybe it'll turn tan. I jsut woke up about half an hour ago and Daniel is supposed to be cooking me breakfast (he promised).
