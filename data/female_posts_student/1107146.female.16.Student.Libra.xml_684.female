And I was a girl, a very flirtatious one (to the point of one of the guys "abusing" me, but I kicked his ass and laughed so it was ok), and I got away with a lot of shit. And then something or another happened, and I quit, which was sad because I was owning. But whatever.   I heard that, the typing better deal. I coulda locked up a good computer in my hayday...then I found out about the wonderous hotkey and macro functions c/o GMud (you'll find out what these are soon enough, or you could ask someone) and I was the Lord of All N00Ber Creation, but my typing kinda blew.   "st t  " "f" "f" "f" "rat". Hah. I just killed a rat. I can't believe I remembered that. What a loser I am.  But then someone else was playing it and they know how it feels once you get hooked. So I felt better.
