Two good friends together. I often see matthew either going to work, or going home from work. Got once, how sweet he was, he helped to carry my guitar until we reached his block and we had to part our own ways. That time, I was truly tired, luckily with his help, it helps to complete half of my journey home.   OK, continue with my chat with Kai.  Nice to hear that his 'gang' of people are still together.  BUt that does not include SH JF  JY. These 3 girls, back in secondary school days, you cant separate them, lolz. They are nice girls... very sweet n hardworking, miss them so much. Due to something, we kind of got separated, and we were like never before. But i still miss them. They are friends worth making. I truly wish them all the best to their future. Smile~  Talking about friends...  I'm rather lonely...  I do not have a group of friends which i can go out together.  I have friends everywhere, but just friends that just say, HI then bye.  I spend my weekend in church to do service to God. I have more old people as my friends than the youths.  Weekdays, i slag at home, a home girl. ( during holidays ) Spend time with God, learning to sing songs from church, and MSN!! chatting.   Hmm, haven touch my guitar for a long time.     Friends must be always in your life. For they are your support,your eyes, your ears, your mouth and your shoulder.
