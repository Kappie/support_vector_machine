When we got teird of swimming, we went outside in the back and went tanning, so we can both get those nice golden brown summer tans. And I got half of a tan. Olivia is coming over soon, so we can have a sleepover, but in the meantime we are going to go outside again and get MORE of a tan. Summer is almost over, and it is a requirment to have a tan. Damn RIGHT. I need to go now, I think Olivia is here.  -Sierra
