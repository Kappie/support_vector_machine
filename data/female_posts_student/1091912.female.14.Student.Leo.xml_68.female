I cant put this at my blog because it is under CONSTANT scrutiny for posts like this. Finally I've found someone who's more in love with my computer than me! WOW! And what more who LOVES my email account more than me! Maybe it was an accident or maybe it was intentional. For all of you who don't know, I have this thing on my com where all you have to do to sign in on msn is to click on my add. So after her ROYAL HIGHNESS finished with her daily hogging of my computer, I found the msn signed in to MY account. Like ok... Some of you may think I'm being childish some of you may think I'm being immature but Im really tired. For 2 days I've been trying very hard but no, all I get is SILENCE. That's IT! I can't tell you all this in school nor do i think I can keep this in till next week without going mad. So here's it. all you guys have been seeing for the past few days is just a facade. Anyway I cant blame her for using my com so often coz maybe thats the only way for her to stay in touch with hong kong but yeah. She's extreamly homesick so someone give me some solutions. God, help me. Sorry guys if this looks like a private blog post but as i said, my blog is being visited EVERY other hour... Even when Im in the room. Like freaky. For more info on why i said that, go read my tag board. I'm too freaked to reply....
