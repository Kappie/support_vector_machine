Fullprice movies at the theater, with a student discount of course. And wouldn't ya know it, prices went up 50 cents a flick just in time for my binge. So I thot about it and I figured the best thing to do is offer my own movie ratings for every show I saw. These ratings have nothing to do with professional ratings, but they are probably more reliable.  A+ Shrek 2 (first time) (Puss in Boots is unbelievably cute) A- Shrek 2 (second time)  A- Troy (up from a B+ b/c of Brad's beautiful butt!)  B- The Day After Tomorrow (I'm freeezing to death!) A- Saved! (God loves you, even if you are a fuckup) B+ White Chicks (Nicois salad, nuff said) A  Fahrenheit 9/11 (Admittedly biased, but mostly true. Strong argument) C+ Dodgeball (No one should have to see man-tits do that)  And for the hell of it: A  Zoolander (rent) (ORANGE MOCHA FRAPPUCINO! thats all) A+++ Family Guy - Season Three (rent) (Da Boom, Brian in Love, Death is a Bitch, etc)  Left on my list are: Mean Girls Spiderman 2 Harry Potter 3 The Stepford Wives The Terminal Harold and Kumar go to White Castle  And on a highly relevant side note, I absolutely gotta get Seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 of The Family Guy. I LOVE that show with a passion like none other. Beautiful men and caramel fudge brownie ice cream can hardly compete. It is quite nearly the love of my life.   And I'll love you too if you support my mission to acquire it. Hint hint.  Oh I'm sooooo subtle.
