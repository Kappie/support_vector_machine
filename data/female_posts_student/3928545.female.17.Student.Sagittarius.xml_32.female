When I get “attacked” I don’t just take it (you didn’t literally “attack” me, but it’s like I can’t have my own opinions, I can’t respond). You know that. Why are you surprised? I’ve always done it, and probably always will. That’s my personality. I have character flaws, and you (along with the rest of the world) have them too. Like I said, I don’t know what else to do.      You don’t have to stay, but I hope that you would anyway; all you do is up and go –The Starting Line
