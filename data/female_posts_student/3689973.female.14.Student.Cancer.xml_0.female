I'm storing the http thingys here until I can figure out how to put links in my side bar and figure out which ones I wanna watch.  urlLink The Life of WooÂ³,   urlLink A Day In The Life Of Jeffrey Macarone,   urlLink Cause I said so, and   urlLink My Blog  Got bored looking at them. I just looked at the interesting titles. I really liked this one title Random Mumblings and Fishsticks or something like that. Crud monkeys I 4got to shave again! O well even more fuzzys. Still hav more 2 say but am tired.
