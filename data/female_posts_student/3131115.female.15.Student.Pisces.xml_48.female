I watched scary movies too, so that doesn't really help much. Stupid me. It's really really late, and I just want to go to sleep, but I can't. I'm such a loser. So, now...being in my room again I am going to do nothing but scratch myself in fear that there is a large spider crawling across my skin, bound to bite me at any second. I'm over-reacting. Grr...I'm soo tired. :( I miss Bill. I want to call him, but I dont think that his family would be really okay with that. I guess what I'll do is just lay in bed and try to think happy thoughts, like fluffy bunnies and stuff instead of spiders and things that crawl. Hopefully I can sleep soon. I really dont feel like sleeping alone tonight, I dont know why..I just dont. :(  I'm going to warped tour. yayy, daddy finally gave the okay.
