Anyway I'm glad to finally know what South Lake is. A few months back when I was dating Travis he mentioned going to South Lake with some of his friends. Not knowing what this was, I kept to myself, but assumed it was a restaurant. I imagined it to be like, for those of you familiar with Austin, Oasis or Hula Hut. Glad to know it's a city.It's a nice place I will say.  I also went to Red Robin. For those of you familiar with my favorite show, Newlyweds, Jessica Simpson ate there. So when I found out that my friend lived near one, I just had to go. It was good.  On another note, it's a good thing I darkened my hair today as I so was a dumb blonde. Everyone says it's not good to talk about money, politics, and something else, but I can't remember now the other one. But I figure, whatever comes to my mind is good to talk about. So I did. So when this girl I was with started talking about money, I chimed in. Apparantly her uncle is this guy that ran for president a few years ago. John McCain. I don't remember him. The name sounds familiar though. Anyway she told us that she has a trust fund that she can't touch yet, but has a good amount of money in it. Of course, I'm curious so I ask how much? She wouldn't answer, but said it was enough. This girl is so trashy. That's not the point though. The point is this.....I have no qualms discussing my broke ass financial status, so why should anyone else?   Okay so maybe money talk is not good. So lets talk about me. Again it's good I'm a brunette. I was looking at this German calendar and was looking at the wording for the days of the week. Well the first two, Sunday and Monday I saw in German. But when I read the other days, I read them in English and said, "Wow, Tuesday-Saturday are the same in English as they are in German". My friend just kind of looked at me funny and said, "Rebecca that's in English, that's not German". It's time like these when I say, "yeah I'm getting a doctorate".
