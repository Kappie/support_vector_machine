Pizza lunch was alright today...i miss the old pizza and no one wants to come anymore so we are practically friendless. Blah. I have nothing to do tonight except write a college essay. Wooooooo. Ben keeps looking at me its' making me uncomfortable. Jon Saylor is in here....he's so hot. In a very hot way!! YeaAaAaAah....i think i'm done. OH we played golf today and i almost hit the ball to the 100 flag...but i didn't. Aww hell. I'm worse than jessica simpson so i basically need to die. BYE
