A massive W00T because Waitrose have kept me on file from January when I applied, and they are now recruiting and have chosen me and a few other people to attend an interview on Saturday at 2:30.  Have yet another computer upgrade request from a girl called Eolie in year 11. Another w00t. Selling my AIO printer for £30. W00t again.  The course I want to take at university will be one of: (BSc) Computer Architecture And Design (BSc) Computer Systems Engineering (BSc) Computer Systems  Sometimes they are Hons, sometimes they are not. Pff.
