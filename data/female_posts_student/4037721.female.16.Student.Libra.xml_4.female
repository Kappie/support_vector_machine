I will probably get no more than an hours sleep if anything due to my current sleeping patern, I usually get to sleep at 2am. So that gives me an hour beforeI have to get up again to go to the airport. Might get some sleep on the aeroplane, but that will only be if I can't keep my eyes open. You see I am very strange about travel, I can't sleep when I am traveling. I have to be aware of whats going on around me, don't ask why I am just odd like that, get used to it.        I will miss  Kat  so much, but then I can't wait until I get back as she will be here. It's hasn't sunk yet that I will get to  see  her,  feel  her,  smell  her,  hear  her...*Drifts Into A Day Dream* It just seems unreal. well I am sure I will wake up and smell the coffee when our first meeting comes up. She said she may goto the airport early to pick up her brother just to  spy  on me, lmao. Bye for a week! I will update when I get back, I promise.
