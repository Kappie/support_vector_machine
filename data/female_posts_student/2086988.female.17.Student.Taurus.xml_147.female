Now I get to get all ready for dance camp tomorrow...Yay...Part of me wants to go and the other is like I'd rather just stay at home. I know it'd be more fun if I was an actual dancer so I know what to expect. Being a manager, I assume I'll just be hanging out with Mrs. Gibson, but I don't know. Plus, what really sucks is we're not allowed to bring our cell phones. But I'm going to bring mine, I won't be able to talk, but maybe I can text once we get back to the room.       Ugh, I feel like I have a cold. My throat is all sore and itchy and my nose is all stuffy. Hopefully it's just from the change of climates and it'll be all better tomorrow.     I lie awake   Drive myself crazy   Thinking of you
