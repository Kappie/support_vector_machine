And it was uphill.  so HA!  And then after that was over i came home and took a shower and we went to the rockies vs. cubs game and the cubs won (alright!) which was awsome and then we came home.  That's about it for today.  Oh yeh, suncom has really bad service in Denver for so no me gusta suncom.  Oh amez and magee are making me a live journal so soon i'll be getting that and they'll be no more blogger.  so muchas gracias to them.  Well tomorrow i get to go shopping in the AWSOME mall that they have here so yay for that.  That's about it.  You'll here more tomorrow, don't worry.  Love ya!  Liz
