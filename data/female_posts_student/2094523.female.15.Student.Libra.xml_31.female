People who get anythun and anyone they want learn to appreciate less and even less after that till it comes to the point where nothing is significant to them. ones that fuck em all and leave em all become skanks, ones that dont appreciate money become poor, ones that dotn understand the importance of everything around them become stupid, and those that are stupid become hated, and hated ones become assholes and everyone knows that assholes get their asses kicked... but i dont feel pity for them.  Some ppl deserve their asses kicked good.. while i watch with my eyes and feel no pity. nothing.
