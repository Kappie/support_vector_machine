Example:  The other night, I fell asleep at, oh, 3 or 4 a.m., knowing perfectly well that I had to wake up early the next morning. So, at 7, I wake up feeling very tired, but not to a dramatic extent or anything. I go to an eye appointment at 8:15 that lasts about 20 to 30 minutes. On the way home, I pick up a Caramel Frappucino with a power pack(I figured I'd need an extra pick-me-up for the day). I go to work at 10, tire myself out for 4 hours, and head home at 2. I get home, take a shower, and then call a friend about going to the mall. We leave for the mall about 4, and get back at around 7 or 7:30. Then we decide to go to Starbucks(I'm quite exhausted, and I need another pick-me-up to get through the night-- might I add...we walked ). I get an Iced Latte(mmm...), and we head back home. We get back at 8 or 8:30, and then decide to go to the park. By 10, I have no idea why, but I'm skipping and singing around the volleyball court(that really wasnt important, but I figured I'd throw it in anyway). Ok, THAT'S a night. I go home and stay up till all hours of the morning...or until I'm tired enough to actually sleep. The point? People starve themselves of sleep, and then find any other alternative to make up for it.  Shame on you all...
