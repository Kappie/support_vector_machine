I tried to call Beth last night but she was busy so I guess I won't get to talk to her until I get home... Plus I'm missing the party tonight, and I'm not sure what she decided on what will and won't be done tonight (as far as alcohol, happy smoke, other, etc.). I'm not depressed about missing the party that much, even though it's different than our other ones b/c it's at Beth's and they don't have to hide out in the basement, I'm just depressed if they do the shrooms w/o me, b/c I wanted to be w/ Bethy and Robert and them when we all did it together for the first time... Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter all that much. If they do it, they do it. If they don't, they don't, and we can do it as a group sometime later... Other things... Lainie has only responded to like... half the texts I've sent her. Heathy hasn't replied at all, and I don't have her address, so I can't send her a postcard. The only person that I've really had contact with is Ken, and there's so much other stuff connected with that...  oiy, forget all of that.  Anyway, I've been pretty much having fun here.  Monday night we went out to Boston Lobster Feast.  All you can eat lobster, crab legs, shrimp, etc.  I ate too much... only 2 lobsters, somecrab legs, shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, cocktail shrimp, london broil, crab cakes...  Then I ate cake for dessert... Tuesday we went to Universal Studios.  I lost my sunglasses... GRRRRRRR  The MIB ride was pretty cool.  You get to shoot aliens! :)  Yesterday we went to Islands of Adventure.  That was better, just b/c there were more rides.  The water rides were awesome, especially when we first got there b/c there was almost no wait at 10 am,  even though it was already hot as hell.  It was good for us though...  Anyway... I got a cool necklace.  It's a silver dragon's claw w/ a red marble in it.  There's another one that I want to talk my dad into buying for me when we go back, but I'm not sure if that will work out...  w/e...  Today... dad has to work until around 6 ish, so I don't really know what I'm  going to do. It's nearly 11 and I haven't showered yet, plus Kait is still sleeping.  The crazy maintenance guys were just here, and I didn't understand a word of what they were talking about b/c it was either heavily accented irrecognizable english or rapid spanish... oh well, hope it wasn't too important.  Anyway, I'm going to sign off and shower, then get dressed and ready and make some lunch.  We'll probably go somewhere when dad gets home...  I'm going to send postcards out tonight, hopefully.  I'll get home before they do, but oh well, they're still fun to send :)  Pookie -- I love you!!! Bethy -- I love you too! (platonic).  Have fun tonight! Ken --  I miss you!  Love you, and can't wait until I get home. Heathy -- why aren't you responding ot my texts??  I need your address! Mande -- Have 'fun' watching the brats!  See everyone later...
