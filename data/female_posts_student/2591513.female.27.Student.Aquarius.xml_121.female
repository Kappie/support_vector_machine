We really need a fence because our dog Stitch is a menace to the yard, all he does is tear it up.  We finally got new pretty flowers and he is digging it all up.  DANG YOU STITCH!  Oh yeah and that is another thing,w be had to clean the garage because he tore up the garage.  That destructive puppy.    You guys wanna hear something funny...haha You guys are going to love this one.  Okay, so I got into planting things (from seeds) but my lazy butt didnt' like labeling the pots.  I just went by what I remembered.  Anyway, so I took the first two pots that grew something and planted them outside (in the front).  Well they are really starting to grow...but I couldn't figure out why the flowers weren't blossoming.   Anyway papa comes home and says, "Who's the dork who planted tomatoes in the front entry way?"  LMAO  Yup, I planted my tomatoes in front and since the tomatoes are growing from it now, papa said not to take em out.  So we are the only block with frickin' tomatoes growing in the front.  Oh and then he was also able to tell us what the other mystery plant was...eggplants....luckily those were still in the pot.  Oh but the peppers I am growing have started yielding peppers...so I am excited about that.  I don't plant much, so it is kinda neat to see my stuff growing.  haha  Too bad I can't tell what the hell I am growing though.  Okay, that's all I have for now.
