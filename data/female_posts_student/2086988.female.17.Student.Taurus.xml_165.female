Anyways, whenever my parents came home, sometime after 7, I went to sleep. Well, I dreamed, for I don't know what reason that I was pregnant, I don't exactly know where I was ( it seemed like a really weird plant store, that had a weird old guy). And all of a sudden my water broke and I call for my mom and out of no where she pops up. Then she tells me to get in the bath, I was like WTF? But I did, and once I stood up my ear stopped up (really weird) and just as I was about to get into the water, my mom comes up and says heres your baby its a girl! At this point I've just lost what all happened. Anyways, I was like mom I need to go to the hospital, and she wouldn't let me, I just wondered around in my dream for awhile and I started feeling really weird and kind of hurting too. Lol then I woke up around 9 and had to pee really bad.  Haha that was soooo messed up.      So this week has turned out alot better, only 2 more days of practice! Yay! And then the kids are coming back on Saturday. Which on Saturday I'm hanging out with Em and Danielle and we're going to go see her bf's play and then make our shirts for 6 flags! And almost 9 days til I see my Davey! :)    You only can rescue me   This is my prayer
