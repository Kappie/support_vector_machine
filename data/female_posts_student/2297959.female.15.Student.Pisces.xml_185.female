God. you feel together getting to know each other all over again. new friends join in Even if they arent allowed. ;) In the back of your mind that small feeling  you know you have to leave. And just maybe never see them again. it draws closer but seems far away. Then its over. Back in the car trying desperately to keep memories. you dont want them to fade. convincing yourself  you will see them again.  A year  thats all you have to wait. its not that long...  its a bad thing. i wont call it a poem because it isnt. i was bored at midnight last night so i turned on a CD (take a wild guess which one) and wrote all my feelings and stuff like that. happy new year.
