I could bring all of my NSYNC cd's and my videotapes of their concerts and interviews and everything else they ever did.  We could listen to the cd's and watch the tapes and eat NSYNC fruit snacks (insert joke here) if they still make them.  And I could bring my NSYNC board game and we could learn all kinds of NSYNC trivia by playing the game.  Wouldn't it be fun?  Okay, I know what you're thinking.  Just remember I said I'll bring food.
