Well, tonight's the Euro Cup 2004 finals and waiting for 2:35am (Singapore time) to come.. made sangria and chilling it in the fridge now =) No idea how a proper sangria should taste like and just made my own after sifting thru a few online recipes.. will know in a while how mine works out!  My darlin' boyfriend and i was walking back home and told him i wanted to get a blog for fun... he asked me why, i said i have journalistic tendancies too - not just him (yah, he's an SPH scholar) and he said - no - i am just an exhibitionist, wanting to publicise my life online - just like other girls!!  So what's your take on that???? (*Boy, he's gonna be hopping mad that i posted this!*)
