But, my mum told me yesterday that he has a TON of old beatles records and a RECORD PLAYER at the beach house!!!!! So next time we go up to the beach house i'm going to take them home with me! Wahhooooooop!  My dad gets home today!  I don't think I told anyone but he and matt have been in colorado all week with Jacob. Jacob comes home to tooo! His birthday was yesterday! I got hima cool shirt at urban outfitters yesterday. I also got a shirt that says "I *heart* (not a *heart* but a heart picture thing, ya know?) Pad Thai" its pretty spiffy. Its bright pink! Haha. I was going to get another beatles shirt but I didn't have enough money to get 2 shirts for me and a present for Jacob.   yeah...
