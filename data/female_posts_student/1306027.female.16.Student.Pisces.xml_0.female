Of course there is an alternative today.... ricky just needs to hurry up and get home so we can wash his van. Lol. Hmmm sounds like loads of fun right? Well when we wash a van we do it with music, which makes the whole expierence a lil more enjoyable. Maybe I will cream lorraine with a nice soapy sponge.,.,.,.,.,!     Im Cold.   Maybe if all of my computers were'nt located in the basement I could quite possibly be rid of this problem.    Moving On   It's kinda pretty out today, in that overcast kinda way. The sun peeks out every hour just to let us know that he is in geocentric orbit still. Not to bad a day for a car wash, that is if the Walmart cashiers have'nt taken ricky hostage by now. Who knows? I don't. But I hope he gets back soon cuz i want to throw that sponge at lorraine!
