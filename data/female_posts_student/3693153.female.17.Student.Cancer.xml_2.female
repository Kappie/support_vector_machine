Well, there was an MTV Pilipinas booth at our school, and he was asking people to cast their votes for Best Act, Best Whatever, etc. So as I was passing by, he was like "Hey, vote now!" and was handing out the ballots, and I was like "Sorry, i've got to go somewhere" and he was like, "Please,please please!" Hehe. So I gave in. Too bad he likes Justin Timberlake. Turn Off.    God, it rained today... and my umbrella broke. Good thing our driver picked me up. Don't know what to do. Ugh, tomorrow i'll have to face my terror prof again.
