I can't figure out if I'm doing it for me or for her.  Maybe I'm just really stressed out right now and dissapointed at some test scores I recieved today.  I don't want to earn good grades for her, score well on the SAT's for her, go to college for her, lose weight for her, play an instrument for  her...gah.  Or maybe I'm just thinking too much right now and I really am doing it for me and it's just hard to get where I want to be.  I'm just sick of it all, I want to be done with highschool.  Gopher Sounds didn't have Ani's CD today. Grr
