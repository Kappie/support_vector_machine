I did a quick clean up before he arrived. Josh and Mike were suppose to come over too, but the second wave of storms hit and they stayed at Angie's place. I took Nick out for Starbucks and then we went for a drive in the RX7. After hanging out at my house for a bit, he decided to leave and stay the night at Kettering (even though he's going to end up down here in the morning anyway, oh well). The weather is bad, I hope he makes it back safely. I don't know if he didn't stay because his shit's in Kettering or because Mike and Josh didn't show up. Which ever reason, I don't mind. My dad got pissed that he was in my room anyway. I helped him clean out the car and then he drove off, and I ran back inside.   I'm now trying on my "prom dress" for tomorrow night. I don't know if I want to wear a dress anymore. Maybe if we come back to my house I'll dress up but I don't want to wear this all tomorrow night. They can deal with it...  I also hope my asshole of a brother shows up tomorrow. Maybe we'll make amends over a couple beers and some shots.  Contemplation.
