The graphics look absolutely beautiful, and they are the best water effects that I have ever seen. The Pikimin also have their same cuteness, adorable looks as they did from the first game. Now there are two new species of Pikimin joining the crowd, a white and purple breed. They are always so happy go lucky and skipping behind Olimar, then when they face a foe, they turn into these dangerous monsters that behead the enemy. It is very disturbing, but that is what gives the game it's unique charm.
