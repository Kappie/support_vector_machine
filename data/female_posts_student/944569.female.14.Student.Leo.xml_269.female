No free will, no opinion, no nothing.  Anybody could just mold me to do anything they want.  Why am i so soft?  Say something wrong and i start to weep.  why?  Once a tear leaks out, i cant stop the waterworks.   Quote Erene, " Your eyeballs are going to melt soon because you've cleaned them too much with salt water."  How can i become more tough?  i dont want to be a shell with a heart of stone but if anyone knows my weakness they could do anything.  i can never say no
