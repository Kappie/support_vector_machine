Over the weekend I went to Colorado Springs for my brothers wedding (you can read all about it at:  urlLink www.livejournal.com/users/txladi )       School is going good. I just finished my 3rd week and so far so good. On monday night I have computer applications and that class is pretty easy for me. On monday we start Microsoft Excel, so can't wait to learn that.       Tueday night I have Medical Law  Ethics/Therapeutic Communication. That class is ok, truthfully the teacher is making it boring :(  But over all he is pretty good. Our final exam is so easy. Each week I have to find an article over both subject and clip it out, write a one page summary, have a cover sheet for both, and have a reference sheet for both. We turn them all in (total of 24 articles) at the end of the quarter.  For me all the terms in Medical Law are confusing, while in Therapeutic for me is more interesting. I actually enjoy Therapeutic more (if only the instructor would make it more fun to learn, I would be forever happy and not sleepy in class LOL). I have a my first quiz this coming tuesday in Therapeutic.       Wednesday night I have Anatomy and Pathophysiology II. So far we went over the blood and the heart. I actually enjoyed the heart and caught on pretty quickly of how the blood flows through the heart and the names of the atrias, ventricles, etc of the heart. We have 2 quizes this coming wednesday on what we just went over, as we are behind in that class. First week we went home an hour later due to AC going out at school. Last week had a substitute in that class, and I actually enjoyed the substitute as she was a Dr. She used to be a cardiologist but has changed her major to herbal. She told us lots of stories good, bad, sad, and gross (but for me it was sooo exciting to hear them all).       Thursday I have English Composition II. Now I do not like english but this instructor makes it fun (and this instructor actually teaches us, so I am learning something yeahhhh LOL). Last night I just turned in my first essay which was over cause and effect. Now my next new essay is over compare and contrast. I first thought of doing a compare and contrast with my brother, but realized he and I have a whole lot of similarities so would be hard. So I decided to do a compare and contrast with my mother as she and I are alike but soooo different on alot of things that she will make it easier for me to write this essay LOL :) Also last night our instructor had us watch two different versions of Romeo  Juliet to help show us compare and contrast. Would you believe I did not understand and darn word of Shakespeare LOL :) The instructor picked on me LOL but I seriously did not understand a word :)       Other than that I am trying to figure out how to be my tutoring done in Pre-Alegbra and English, as I didn't quite pass the COMPASS entrance exam on those two areas. I have to have those two tutors done my October, so guess I better get my hiny moving LOL. I can do them both online, so that makes it easier for me.       Lets see... OH! on tuesday a class mate in another class was needing a volunteer for practice with phlebotomy, so I volunteered. Boy the memories came back of when I learned how to do them (when I took Medical Assistant class before). I wasn't nervous but he was, but he did a good job and listened to me when I told him I have rolly poly veins :)  Then another girl asked if she could so I let her. But she was definitely nervous, as they were using the butterflys. She didn't quite get the bity needle in right, as when she was trying to get the file pluged in, blood was coming out of the bevel on my skin. The poor girl felt so bad and nervous. I told her she did not hurt me and I am fine and not upset or anything. I wanted to tell her a secret that I still remember about doing phlebotomy, but decided against it as they all thought I was new and never done that stuff before. BOY!!  I wanted to stay in the class tuesday night and not go back to Therapeutic class LOL. The only thing the two of them did forget about was the turnakit that they left on my arm and had to remind them to take it off (even the instructor told them) as it was turning my arm red and blue by no circulation. I had remembered that it is only to stay on your arm for 30 seconds, so once you put it on, you better be ready to stick right away and while you are drawing the blood to the vile, take the thing off (which they didn't). But yet I understood there nervousness as the instructor is right there watching them as he has too. But still I can't wait to start that class :)         Anyho that is all I can remember of what has been going on with me in school :)  Will post more later when I can :)       TTFN
