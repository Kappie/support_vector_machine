She's an aetheist  sorta punk. But she doesn't do what you expect. Like the second to last day of school she showed up in the preppiest of outfits. She had on a crisp white, pink -pin-striped shirt  a pink cardigan over that with the bottom of the shirt showing. The she had on very light colored jeans and pink flip-flops. It shocked everyone except me because she hinted that she was going to do something like that. Well she gave a hint to everyone but I seemed like the only one who remembered. Anyway I hope she can come over when my brother goes camping next weekend. (We live in a two-bedroom house but we have three people. My moms  me share a bedroom but when Ardis is gone me  Ryann can use his room  not annoy the living hell out of mom. Wow that was a lot of ""s) I'm gonna go call her now.
