The guy who was talking wore and ugly shirt and could count. He told us that for every one creidt you took it would require four hours of hw, he then said if you do PSEO full time it is 15 hours. WHich is like a normal 40 hour job. Dad then retorted to me, "did the same person who did the math there pick out his ugly shirt?" That was the highlight, oh and the cookies that tasted like brownies. I came home and talked to people--but Alex, I was never distracted (tears)  I got up at 845 and went to school for no real reason.  Study hall consistanted of me studing for ACTs reading my book and talking to Leah. Creative writing was all about watching October Skies and Current Affairs was all about playing Yatsee with Jennifer and Mr. Prishtash. I won! (do a little dance). I came home and watched Summerset which I tapped last night. It had aunt becky from full house on it, how could i resist? Then I took a nap and read my book. We ate spagetti and then went for a walk. Now I am talking to Meri, maybe I will be "distracted" again tonight. there is always hope.   Todays reading of the Bible was: Daniel 10 and Isaiah 57:17-18 (those are amazing verses, read them)
