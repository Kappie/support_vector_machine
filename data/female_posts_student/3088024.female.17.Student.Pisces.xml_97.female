Apparently, men were just not made for one spouse and causing them to be with only one woman is going to cause psychological problems and will cause a rift in the marriage because the man's needs are not being met.  HOLD UP!  I said so You think we should not get married and just sleep with whoever.  He said No no no.  There are certain benefits to getting married but a man needs a woman on the side.  I said So you advocate for polygamy?  Him-No.  A man needs one steady woman and a woman on the side with whom he has no emotional attachment that changes on a regular basis.  Me-SAY WHAT!  So you think there is just this pool of women floating out there that don't want to get married?  They just enjoy being tossed from man to man.  Him-No.  You are totally distorting what I am saying.  They don't have to be unmarried.  They could have a husband and a boyfriend too.  Me- So you wouldn't mind if your wife cheated on you?  Him-Um...err...I guess not.  Me-YOU GUESS NOT!!!  You were not even thinking about the emotional side of a relationship are you?  YOUR PLAN DOES NOT WORK.  IDIOT!(I didn't say idiot.  It isn't generally a debate winner.)  Him-Well a man being constricted to one woman doesn't work.  It causes resentment toward your spouse.  Me-How?  What did she do?  Him-Well not being able to  express [emphasis mine] yourself causes emotional blockage.  Me-What the heck is emotional blockage?  Him-Well being with only one woman causes emotional blockage.  So a man needs--Me(cuts him off)-I did not ask for the cause.  I asked for a definition.  Stop repeating yourself.  Get back to me when your views are better defined.(end conversation)  GRR!!!  I hate idiots.  They are just so prevalent.  And they have no idea what they are saying.  Just dumb excuses for acting on base impulses.
