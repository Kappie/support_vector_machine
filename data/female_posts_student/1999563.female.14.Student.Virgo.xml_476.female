I just blowdryed my hair so now I am really bored..I am all ready for school but we don't leave for an hour!  Crazyness.  Today I have schooooool, tennis, and church. It looks like its raining right now so I might not even have tennis. Yay. Then I would work on my garden and practice my geeeeetar! Happpy days.  Weather.com says its supposed to rain until 12 then get sunny again..I doubt I will have tennis but its still a possibilty. Yay. I love tennis..but I have many other things to do!  I better start studying for spanish..we should have a test when our teacher gets back. Did you hear about that? Her sister is like dying so we is gone and no one knows when she will get back.  We were supposed to have a test today but we obviously aren't. Yay!  I wonder what I should make for lunch today..oh yeah! Its pizza day! Wahooooooooo!  I think I will get 2 peperonis.  I might even splurge and get  a sobe..did I tell you about our NEW sobe machine?!?!??!?!  Its pretty coool! When it came on friday we all just stared at it because it was soo beautiful!! The sobe  comes in cans! hahha. Its weird but cooool!  I haven't had one yet because they are a dollar for a little can which is kinda expensive. My bangs are really crispy.  Last night I was laying in my bed and I was like "I smell like fish!" is was...weird... :) I didn't even smell like fish..its just a really fun thing to say!  Now its is 6:42 and I better go do something more produvtive like make my lunch..but wait! Its pizza dayyyy!!!  :)
