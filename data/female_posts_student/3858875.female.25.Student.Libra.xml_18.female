(no, i wasn't told this before taking the job.)  i found out today that there's another potential hurdle, which may or may not materialize. I asked the ombudsperson in our organization to mediate the dispute resolution. i was under the impression that the ombudsperson would bring the motion (for my pay raise) to council - now i found out that she doesn't. the very committee who initially set my pay (and subsequntly refused to increase it) has to. They can choose not to. if they don't, the salary increase can only be brought to council at the next meeting... in late august - a week before my term ends.   you would think that they would just put the motion onto the table. but. at a previous meeting, when the council first voted on my and my colleagues' salaries, the ombudsperson asked the committee to strike out the passages about my position because it was under investigation. not only did they refuse to do so, but when she tabled that idea as a motion, the council also turned it down. i'm feeling particularly suspicious because the head of the committee took a very long time (3 weeks at least) to submit her materials to the ombudsperson during the investigation. (it's pretty embarrassing. funny enough, a lot of people in the organization complain about the university administration, but i find the u.a. people *so* much easier to work with)  everytime the situation comes up - which is roughly once every two weeks - i get very upset. i feel tight, anxious, and unable to concentrate on my thesis work. this whole thing has been so emotionally taxing. i don't have any other funding right now, though. part of me thinks - my current salary is only minimum wage, and my proposed salary is only $10/hour. surely i can live without that, and all of this stress. the other part of me isn't so sure.   does anyone have any advice?
