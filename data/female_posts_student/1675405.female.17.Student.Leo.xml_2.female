The minute you close your hand And squeeze tightly to hold on, The sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold on to some of it, But most will be spilled."  This truly hits heart, not because I feel just a sense of comprehension, but instead because I feel such a strong sense of relation. This has indeed happened to me so many times in the past, you think I would have learned by now, but I guess that is not how things work with me. The moment I feel as if I can consider someone as a good friend, I grab ahold of whatever I thought I had, in all hopes of capturing the joy of being able to share my life with another person rather than keeping it locked up inside myself like I have always done. But what are you supposed to do? Put all fear at hold for fear of running this newfound aquaintance off? Or, be the person that you are, and show this new aquaintance how you truly are on the inside? Because then aren't you showing the person the "real you," and isn't that the preferrable of the two because you'll be gaining a friend that accepts you for who you really are?
