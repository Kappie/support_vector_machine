It always got silent at the most awkward moments. Liz, Erica, and I went to walk around the Short North after class. We saw some cool things, especially an old man lying with his legs straight up in the air in the middle of the road. Yes boys and girls, he was hit by a car. 1,000 police men and like 5 different trucks came to his rescue, and by rescue I mean propping him up in a plastic lawn chair. Lucky bastard. We went to Skyline... mmmmmmmmmmmm... and Erica and I ate some dog biscuit. It was like a dry cracker, but it left the worst taste in your mouth! Don't try them. I'm babysitting like a mad woman and it's killing me.
