I don't know why he has to interrupt my life on a daily basis, doesn't he have something better to do. After three and a half years he has managed to call me every day and at most he has missed maybe a month in a half, a day here or there. I am so tired of it. It is over and I don't want to talk to you everyday and there is not even a chance that I will take you back. Don't you understand that. Move on find another hobby or someone else to harrass with all your insecurities because I am not the one. It seems like when I finally made the decision to move on with my life, doors began to open up for me, there is no way that I can look back now.  If I take the right steps maybe my life will be in line like it was before I even met you. It is always going to be harder because I have two children now but I have adjusted and I have been doing it by myself for the past 31 months. I like to live a carefree life not having to answer to anyone except for God. He likes to ask the questions, "have you talked to any guys or got any numbers"? I am like just because I am moving on does not mean I am looking to get in the first relationship that comes along. I am not even open to dating right now. I HAVE TWO CHILDREN UNDER 3! DO YOU SEE ANY TIME THERE?  So this morning he asked me, "do you be chopping it up on the phone, and do they mind"? My response was you are the only one that calls because you are the only one that does not seem to realize that I am at work. Emailing is fine but being on the phone constantly to deal with an insecure man is something totally different. Maybe if you had something going for you other than me, when we were together, you would have some self esteem. I did not get to where I am over night it took a lot of hardwork, putting up with people's B.S., tons of school and nights that I did not know if I was going to make it through. Life is a blessing so take advantage of it don't just let it pass you by, because in the end you are the only one that will have any regrets.
