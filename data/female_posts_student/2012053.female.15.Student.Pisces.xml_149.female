The Associated Press Updated: 9:44 p.m. ET July 01, 2004WIMBLEDON, England - On the most hallowed ground in tennis, Maria Sharapova sank to her knees, overwhelmed by what she had just achieved.   It’s a long way from Siberia to the Wimbledon final, and Sharapova completed the journey in 17 years.  With a zeal that delighted the Centre Court crowd, the precocious Russian rallied to beat 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-1 in the semifinals Thursday. Sharapova will play two-time defending champ Serena Willliams for the title Saturday.  “It’s absolutely crazy,” said tennis’ newest star, who was born in Siberia and has lived in Florida since age 6. “I never expected it to happen so early in my life. Getting to the final of Wimbledon, my favorite tournament, is just amazing.”  Only two women’s finalists were younger than Sharapova: Martina Hingis, who won the title in 1997 at 16, and Lottie Dod, the champion in 1887 at 15.  “Maria’s very good right now,” Davenport said. “And she’s 17. She’s going to get a lot better.”  Russia is an emerging force in women’s tennis, with six players ranked in the top 15, and Sharapova may be the best of the bunch.  Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam title when she beat compatriot Elena Dementieva in the French Open final last month. Sharapova is the first Russian woman to reach the Wimbledon final since Olga Morozova, who was beaten by Chris Evert for the 1974 title.  While she’s now the toast of Moscow, Sharapova’s celebrity is sure to extend far beyond her homeland. The 6-foot blonde is poised and personable, speaks fluent English and has had a modeling contract since 2002.  “She’s the best of the new lot,” 1977 Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade said. “She is truly exciting to watch.”  Her semifinal victory enlivened a tournament that had been largely devoid of drama on the women’s side.  Sharapova fell behind 2-1 in the second set before rain interrupted the match for 52 minutes. When play resumed, she lost the next game before commencing her comeback, winning 12 of 16 points to reverse the momentum.  What did she do during the rain delay to help turn things around?  “I was reading OK! magazine,” a celebrity publication based in London, she said. “It was quite boring.”  Not her match. Still on the verge of defeat in the second-set tiebreaker, she smacked six winners to pull it out, then walked to the chair waving her fist as the crowd roared.  The seesaw opening game of the final set lasted 18 points and ended when Sharapova whacked a ferocious return to break serve. From there she pulled away.  Sharapova reached match point with a spectacular backhand winner on the run that left her 10 feet beyond the corner of the court. Moments later the victory was hers, and she sank to the turf at the baseline in joy and disbelief.  “It’s a big moment,” Davenport said. “I think she’ll have some more of those in the future. I think this is like her definite breakthrough.”
