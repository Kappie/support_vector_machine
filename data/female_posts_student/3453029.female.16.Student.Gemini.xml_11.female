IT was just too exhausting w/ all the early wake up calls! lol! Anyway, so after we finished up our last hour there, me, Laura, Emily, Pam, and my mom went to see "The Notebook"! I recommend that everyone go see it! It's the best romance movie I've ever seen! It's not ur typical cheesy, "like that would ever happen in real life", too dramatic and over the top romance movie. It's very unique! Just make sure you bring the kleenex w/ you! So, then that night we had to do our final performance for Dan's workshop. It turned out better than I thought it would!  After that, a bunch of us went out to Applebee's to eat. Me, Laura, Emily, Katlyn, and Katherine all sat at the same table. WE had a really cute waiter too named Nick. *sigh*! lol! We were all kidding around and came up w/ lots of inside jokes. It was storming outside and lightning and all of us saw it but Laura. We kept telling her it was lightning ,but she wouldn't believe us. Finally she saw it. lol! Then we started kidding around like it was her paparazzi following her around and taking pictures of her. Then we started kidding around about Nick. We came up with a lot of different stuff we should say to him. LIke, he gave me my receipt and I wrote, " #?" on it at the bottom. And we were all making funny winks. And then I said, "Act like I just said something funny!" and we all busted out laughing b/ it was actually funny that I said that. It was just a very funny night!  This week, I've just been resting and catching up on my sleep. It's been very nice! My mom and stepdad also surprised me this week by taking me to see "The Notebook" again. I was so happy! Then I went the next day too w/ Susannah! I still haven't even gotten enough of that movie! Today, some of the kids at Foothills Playhouse did their monologues for the 4th of JUly celebration we had today in town. Me and Laura were in that group. It was okay. Then me, my mom, and Jeff (stepdad) went back tonight to listen to The Flashbacks perform. I met Laura there. HEr and her dad came to watch the fireworks. It was fun!   Now, I've just got to be prepared for Sherri's workshop that I"m helping w/ next week! (sarcastic) Woo hoo! lol!   Are you happy now, Laura? Now you have something to read!   P.S. If there is three things of this same post, please ignore it!  My computer is completely wacked!
