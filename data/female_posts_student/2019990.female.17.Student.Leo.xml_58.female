Then we figured out how to use a new machine in my aunt's office, and I followed the physician's assistant around for two patients after that, and learned more things about the female anatomy than I thought possible in two hours.  I even got to use a microscope.  Cool huh?  Then we went to surgery, and I had to wear the whole sexy surgery ensemble with the hair cover and even shoe covers.  Surgery actually went well,I couldn't see all that much, because I wasn't fully scrubed up, and couldn't touch anything that had been sterilized. But my aunt said I did really well, I didn't get dizzy or faint.  Apparently I'm the first girl she's brought in that didn't get sick.  So that just enforces the cold and soulless theory.  Too bad.  Well, we have to run to the grocery store to pick up supplies for my cousins graduation reception.  Miss you all.  talk later.
