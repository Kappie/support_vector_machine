They air it every night on 10 pm, which lasted about 2,5 hours (the original series's duration is 2 hours, here is + 30 mins commercials). *yawn* I'm soooooo sleepy.  Anyway, I'm just gonna say what a coincidence. They air  Band of Brothers  about a week before the  Dreamcatcher  release. See? What a coincidence. Hopefully, this will make people flock to the theatre and watch the movie.  Aww, man. I feel awful. This is what I get if I had a weird dream last night. But I can't even remembered it. Aaaaaaaaargh!!! At least, I got to see  John Vause  again this morning. He's still in Basra, reporting on the pumping of crude oil there. Gooosh, *yawn* sleepy, sleepy, sleeepy. Maybe I should get more sleep.
