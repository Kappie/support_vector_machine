Haha yea - It's funny but it not because it hurts like...Okay imagine licking your wounds and pouring salt on them. Or a really small but really deep paper cut. Though it wasn't me who got lemon juice in the eye. It was Nick! Yea - but he's okay though. Anyway the story goes...  His birthday was on the Sunday - July 11th, and unfortunately (or fortunately) I was busy - so we couldn't get together that night. (I'll explain the fortunately part later and why I couldn't later.) So to make it up to him - I just HAD to take him out or else I'd feel really bad how we kind planned stuff and then stuff got cancelled. Yea so anyway I took him out for lunch today! Hehe what a pair we make. haha - I can never say That we haven't tripped and fallen because if I did than five minutes later guess what'll we do? - trip and fall! Anyway back to the story - one of the noodles of my Cajun Chicken Alfredo, Slipped off my fork spraying sauce at my forehead ..Some thing got on to my eyebrow. Anyway five minutes later, he's squeezing a lemon and the lemon decided to take revenge. Take revenge as in spraying lemon juice back into Nick's eye. It wasn't good. Yea - but he;s okay though.   Anyway the reason why I couldn't see him on Sunday was because I had a double shift at the hospital last week. One on Friday and than one on Sunday. Though I did get my work done on Sunday pretty fast. Also its kind of a good thing that me and nick never got together because the weather decided to take a turn for the worst. Holy man did anyone see how hard it rained on Sunday?  IT was like the Niagara falls of all storms. Not to mention the big lighting thunder and tornado warnings all around the city. It was scary - we had to drive through it. Also you know what? Edmonton was a lake and archly road was one of those points that was like... Whoa that's deep.
