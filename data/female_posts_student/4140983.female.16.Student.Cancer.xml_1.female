They were for other people's benefit anyway.  I have no friends. None. OK, well, I have three, but they're online. The rest of the people I know are acquaintances. And none of them know the entire story. Lauren, Tara, and Dae. Everyone else either dislikes me or doesn't care.  More on the person I'm most likely to talk to longest. Lauren. We were best friends in fourth and fifth grade, and it was weird. We caught up earlier this summer when I sought refuge on an old screen name. And I'm sure somebody will read this, probably her, but she pisses me off. I love her, she's SO AWESOME, but she fucking pisses me off with her perfect life. I know she'll beg to differ, about all her problems, but that's what MAKES life perfect is it's imperfections. Honestly. She has this cool hobby that lets her socialize, she has FRIENDS. She has people who care about her. And she's so fucking nice. And that's why there's a problem, because I don't dislike her, not at all.  This summer, I've been thinking about things. The last few days. Tara's boyfriend, Jesse, gave me a copy of the PD and oh my god. Wow. It's making me think. That's hard to do. It's easier to shut my mind off.  We had a debate the other day, about god. I don't see anything wrong with having a god as long as I realize that it's just a creation of my mind. As long as I can doublethink, I'm OK with myself. My major flaw in our debate was that I was equating meaning with god. I tend to do that because it's been predisposed on me by society.  I work for a living, and I hate it when I'm not there. When I'm working, I LOVE my job. It's weird, nobody should, but I do. I love the people, I love mopping, I love pushing buttons on the register. Another case of doublethink.  Band camp starts tomorrow. I really should be in bed, but I can't sleep unless I talk to Dae, and I'm hoping Lauren will be online. Again with the thing, I want to talk to her all the time, but she can't afford to spend all her time online, which I totally get. But still...I hate being disposable. And I am.  I keep a journal, I've written about a thousand pages in a year, which really isn't that much, but it's getting obsessive lately. And I hate it, because I can't write fast enough, so it's not worth writing down my thoughts, because I think too fast to get them out onto the paper. That's why I like typing. It's better than last year, right after I read The DaVinci Code. I wrote backwards on EVERYTHING for like three months. I learned that it doesn't work as well if you're right-handed, so I guess something good came out of that: I can now write left-handed.  I made Dae a bracelet today. I don't want to give it to her. It's so beautiful, it's black RAW with purple irridescent beads that pop up because they're JUST too big for the holes. SO beautiful. But I'll give it to her because it's beautiful. She deserves it. She doesn't think highly enough of herself.  That's another thing that upsets me. I have these wonderful people around me, and they all refuse to recognize that they're SO FUCKING AMAZING. It hurts. That's the ultimate egotism: when you're so wonderful that you can't even fathom how wonderful you are.  What makes it a little better is that Eli feels the same way about me. I didn't know she hated me until about a week ago, but it's a huge ego rush. Honestly, I love it. And that makes me a horrible person. That bothered me this summer, that nobody was jealous of me. And now I have my wish.  I need some new music to listen to. I should write my own songs, but like I've said numerous times, poetry pisses me off because I can't write it. Crafty stuff does too. Perfect or bust, you know?  I was a funny-looking kid.
