Sure sounds a lot better than christmas, don't you think?    urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/vt/alexigloo/OWO.html    ~:~   Yesterday, biking home from Nicole where I'd seen "The little mermaid" (clearly the nastiest disney movie ever!) I saw two  hares  sitting on the road right before me. I started biking faster, because I wanted to see how close I could get - and before I knew, I was  racing  them. I imagine it's a bit like swimming with dolphins -well, except that it's not all wet and you're on a bike and... ok, so maybe not, but I imaginethe feeling might be similar, like you're actually a part of  nature . After a couple of blocks, the hares gave up and jumped in on someonesgarden,and I continued home. (Me getting into the gardenafter them would look a bit strange...) Anyway, I really recommend racing with hares. If you can get  hold  of any, that is.   ~:~     "Toss me a cigarette,  I think there's one inmy raincoat"  "We smoked the last one  An hour ago"  So I looked at the scenery,  She read her magazine;  And the moon rose over an open field.   "Kathy I'm lost" I said,  though I knew she was sleeping.  "I'm empty and aching and  I don't know why"  Counting the cars  On the New Jersey Turnpike  They've all come  To look for America     ~:~   To be on your  way , and suddenly realising you've forgotten  why  and  where  you're going. Doesn't it feel like that?   Simon and Garfunkel are my  heroes !    Kisses/ Carrie
