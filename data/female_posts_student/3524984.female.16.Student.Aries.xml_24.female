And yeah, finally got to see his new piercing, it looks, er... Kind of... Icky right now. Soon, I'll get my lip  eyebrown done. Yeah, that'll be awesome. =) Mike said it doesn't hurt at all, well lemme tell you... your tongue HURTS. It wasn't actually THAT bad, and it didn't get infected all that much. I took it out though. It was just annoying me to no end, having that in my mouth... 24/7 [I knew it was a stupid idea] Meh, there goes 80 bucks to waste. All I have left is my ears, and navel. =\ Anyhow. I have a sunburn. Ouch...  Family is falling apart [Atleast what's left of it]  And it sucks. I haven't known them all that long, and I hate them already. Fucktards...
