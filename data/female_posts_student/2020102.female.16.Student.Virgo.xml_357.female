Connor: Yeah, I like freaked out when they said it was a father, mother and son...  Austin: Yes, that automatically means me. Connor: Well it could have been you, they didn't say who the people were when I was listening. Austin: They still haven't released the names. Connor: So it COULD be you! Austin: Yes.

Connor: No, it's like "Austin: they haven't released the names" Austin: And then "Connor- Both: "-it COULD be you!" Connor: Now you'll remember it, because we re-enacted it for you.  Austin: She'll probably put the re-enacting part on it too.
