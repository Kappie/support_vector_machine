They gave me this special tool to floss with and it hurts and it takes a really long time. Considering I hate flossing to being with, I doubt I will be able to floss a lot without dying. :)  I hate braces. My ortho person said I didn't really need them but later in life my teeth would start to break. My mom was like "Ahh! You must have braces!" My teeth look fine I don't need these horrible things in my mouth.   On the plus side, I was able to eat!!! With my spacers I couldn't eat at all for like 2 days, not fun.
