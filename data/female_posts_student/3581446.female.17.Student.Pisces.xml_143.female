The giant insects in the sky were treated to a feast of parents and relatives. Then we had to barrel down the backroads in the middle of the night. As bad a driver as I may or may not be, I'm already getting to the point I'd rather be driving than let someone else drive. I thought we were doomed for most of the trip.  Anyway, it wasn't all bad... We got to eat at Dairy Queen. ;)  BTW, Bacon is very good. Very good. The best. No meat is better. They should make bacon steaks.
