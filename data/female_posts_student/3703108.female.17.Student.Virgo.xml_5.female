We went to Hurricane Harbor on Wednesday morning and I got pretty bad sunburn. We both did. But I had a lot of fun. That was the first time I ever went to Hurricane Harbor. The lines were kinda long and it was pretty cold out, but it was still fun. Anyway, after we left Hurricane Harbor, we went back to Katie's and took showers and then we went out to eat at our favorite diner. We got steaks. It was really expensive. As we were coming out of the diner, my cell phone rang and it was this weird woman who I got a prank call from about a month ago. She was saying her name was "Jeanette Farrentino" and she lives in East Orange and she works at a medical group. At first I thought it was a wrong number because she said she was looking for "Vivian" but then she started asking me weird questions, so I knew it was a joke. She was acting like she didn't know who I was, but after like ten minutes, she said my last name and where I'm going to college next year, and then she hung up on me. That really freaked me out. I thought it was my best friend, Deanna, but I called her from Katie's phone while I was talking to "Jeanette" and she picked up, so I knew it couldn't have been her. Later on, she called me again and said that I'll find out who she is soon. All the other times she called, she blocked her number, but this time she forgot to. So we told Katie's uncle about it and he called her from a different phone and acted like he had the wrong number. She answered the phone in the same weird accent that she was talking to me in and he was trying to get her to say her name, but she wouldn't. Then he tried looking the phone number up online, but it kept saying that it was unlisted or something. So then he told us he has a friend in the FBI, and he called him, but there was no answer. Then we went back to Katie's house. We were up really late because Katie's brother got back from his trip to Belize in the middle of the night and we went with their Dad to pick him up from the school. Since it was like 3:00 in the morning, I figured this girl's phone would be off, so I called it to see what the answering machine said. The answering machine came on and it was the same person, with the same accent, using the same name! We couldn't believe it. I was really starting to get freaked out. I couldn't think of anyone who would do that to me. Anyway, today we went to Six Flags and Katie's uncle called and he said he got in touch with his FBI friend and they found out who it was. It was this girl, Candace, who is Deanna's friend, who I barely even know. I have no clue why she would prank call me like that. And she didn't even say anything to Deanna about it. Very strange. Anyway, tomorrow they're throwing a surprise graduation party for Dan and their cousin, Danny. Katie has to bring them to the movies to distract them, so I'm going over early to greet everyone. It should be fun. I hope Izzy and his Mom will be there. I also hope Evan will be there. But I know he won't. I talked to him last night and I said I don't think I'll ever see him again because he's always so busy and he has no time for me and he almost started crying. I hope I get to see him soon. I miss him and I'm very worried about him. Ok, I think I'm gonna go lay down for a while. I need to relax.
