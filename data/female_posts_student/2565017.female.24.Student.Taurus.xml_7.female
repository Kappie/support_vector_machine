I assumed it was Punjabi MC.... now I've been trying to find the song on Yahoo free launch radio... and after listening to a few Punjabi MC songs, realised that that's not the way to find it...   So I did a search on google 'peugeot commercial music' and found out from one link that it's a song by Bhangra Knights. The next thing to do was to find out where it's available, so I searched by Bhangra Knights.... and at the site, which I've linked here, it's free to download.... so go get yourself a piece of some KICK ASS music =)  http://www.bhangraknights.com
