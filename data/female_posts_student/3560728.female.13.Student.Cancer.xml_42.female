And I was thinking, "Why are they dead? Who killed them? Was it me? What's happening?" This dream may have been a result of the chocolate cake, or this book I'm writing that involves dead flowers. I don't know. I was going to look it up in my dream dictionary but I've decided not to, cuz that's all bullshit and it was too real, and too wierdly frightening to be dissected by some stupid book written by some guy who thinks he knows all of this deep stuff, that's actually just BS...
