My favorite song was Why Georgia (in case you were wondering).  Also, though slightly unnecessary, but very funny, I enjoyed the added descriptions of his masturbating to a picture he drew as a teenager, how music and sex are basically exactly the same, and how to best make a nonalcoholic drink look like it's straight up booze.    Also, he wasn't as ugly in real life! Woo!  OK, more details later....
