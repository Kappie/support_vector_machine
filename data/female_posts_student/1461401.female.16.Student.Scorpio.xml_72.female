I dreamed that a whole bunch of drama people were in my house, and we were all upstairs in my parents room because I needed to use the computer in there. Only, Mark had to use it first so I let him (being the good hostess that I am) but he had to creat a new account on some website... I dunno. So while we were waiting for him to finish we were watching this weird kids show (it might have actually been south park) and finally he was done but when he had logged off he had actually logged off of the desktop account... you know what I mean? Well anyway I didn't know the pass word for the family account so Kari and I were freaking out and all the kids started fighting, like, violently when all of the sudden G walks in! She had this big smile on like she didn't notice anyone was fighting...and then lilly woke me up. I think it means I'm having drama withdrawal symptoms. (that and I should never let mark get on my computer without constant supervision) Heehee. Man, I'm still pretty tired. COFFEE TIME!!! "Coffee is for wimps." "So I'm a wimp! NOW GIMME MY COFFEE!" Heeheehee, Rob knows what I'm talking about. ;-)   So tired...  ~Me
