I dunno wud i'll be scoring but like everyone said it's not the end of the world. it isn't the biggest test yet but it's important too BUT the biggest test is yet to come and i have to study danm hard. The composition was okay but i forgotten to write my ques. no :@!!! I also spelled 'phoebia' wrongly.lol. I spelled it as 'phobia' which one is the right one? The starting of my compo was 'it was a windy day. I could smell the salty air of the sea' is it right? I think it's right but some ppl said not. I didn't do my Math hmk during the weekends. muahaha but the teacher didn't collect the papers as the math exam is tomorrow and she wants us to revise/revice??? My whole body froze when she said she wanted to collect but then she decided not to mark. phew . I would be so dead if she did. I actually slept in class while waiting for the english exam to finish.lol.like for 10-15 mins. I opened  my eyes when i found Mdm Hindon walking.lol. Lucky for me that no one noticed i was sleeping. Guess wud? Ronald HO wrote in Hannah's book??? He wrote 'if no one wants eileen i want her.Don't tell her okay?' lol wud crap..Eileen is going to read and find out. He's really full of crap. SO I'm really scared of tomorrow.MATH!!!! suxs man. I'm actually betta in Eng. MAth is Undestructable but it can destruct me easily.Wish gd luck to my friends for 2morrow's battle ... well that's all for now. Bye!     ffO ngiS,    anaid
