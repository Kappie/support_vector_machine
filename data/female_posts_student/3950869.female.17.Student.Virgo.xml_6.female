But of course, we got there way before time. There was a mixup with the tickets Miki and Christopher had, so their luggage was "temporarily" lost. Hahaha. After we got picked up by Uncle Tom and Aunt Kathy we went on over to my Aunt Ann Marie's.It was nice-I saw my Uncle Frank and Aunt Eileen as well. Then we had this nice little barbecue...tasty, I think I can officially say, I like shrimp! Tomorrow we'll be going over to my cousin Beth's house and stay there for a day or two. I think we're also going to the boardwalk. That's all I have to say for now, I feel like I'm ignoring my hostsssss.   Goodnight YouS Guys.
