Then afterwards we got lost! Wow, it's what we're best at! Appart from mum wasn't their so we couldn't blame it on her. Owchie, I've got a head ache from all that map reading, well we finally got unlost cause otherwise I wouldn't be here. Geez, I'm tired, soory lack of concentration. Mmm better go rest head bubi!
