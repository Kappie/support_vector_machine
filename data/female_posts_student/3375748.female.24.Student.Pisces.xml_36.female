Kind of feel wasted my money. Anyway, after that we went to Hong Kong market for change single bills to 25 cents(for parking). Right after we went out from Hong Kong market, we met Kayoko, Mari and Guoli. We were so surprised to see each other because Toshi and I thought Kayoko just went back to Japan, but she came back for summer classes. So fast!!! How long did she stayed in Japan? Maybe less than a month. After said bye to them, we took subway to Manhattan. On our way to Manhattan, Toshi met two old Japanese friends who were studying in UB. Toshi was so happy to see them and talk with them. They thought I am a Japanese as everybody does. After we got out of subway, we tried to looking for the Japanese bookstore. Even we went there once before, but none of us could remember where is that place. Then, Toshi went to talk with an Asian guy. I thought he is just a some Japanese who were walking on the street, and Toshi just wanted to ask him if he knows where is the bookstore. But, that guy is a Chinese guy study in UB, who can speak Japanese very well, and they met before. He was looking for the bookstore too, and he helped us fought it. We spend more than a hour in there, and I bought two books. After we left bookstore, Toshi took me to a place called Tribeca. Toshi thought there would be a lot of different stores because that's what books says. However, we walked more than 2 hours around there, and we didn't see anything good. The only thing over there is Chinatown. We got so tired and decided go to East Village. So, we took a Taxi to there because we were too tired!!! After we got there, we looked around, and walked around again!!!! Then, started our dinner in FIGHT. That was good dinner with two tired body. When we above to leave, Toshi met another Japanese person who was in the same high school as Toshi, and they talked a little bit. When we tried to go back to Flushing, it was around 10:00 p.m. We were really, really tired. Finally, we got Flushing and drunk some tea, then decided to go home. After we got in the car and tried to go home, Tadami called me. Guess what! He and Yoko were in the same parking lot with us, and they saw we were leaving, so they kind of followed us, but gave up soon. What a day!!!! We were in NY for 12 hours and we met 9 people!!!!! This is a small world after all!!! Anyway, today was hot, fun, tired and wired!   今天和敏一起去了纽约。早上11点过我们就到了法拉盛，把车停好后就去吃东西。本来想去茶都，可是茶都没有开门，我们就去了糖潮。我的天哪！！！糖潮的东西真是不敢恭维！！！实在是不好吃，我觉得我那钱花得太不值得了。吃完饭后，我们打算去香港超市换些硬币好停车，换了半天才换了4美元而已。出了香港超市向停车场走去时，忽然遇见了Kayoko, Mari和国立，我们都大吃一惊！！！因为Kayoko才回日本不久，怎么那么快就回来了。她说因为她要上暑假课，那也太快了一点，她总共回日本的时间可能还不到一个月。告别他们后，我们就决定坐地铁去曼哈顿，在车上，敏遇见了他的两个日本老友，两个人都是从UB毕业的。其中一个男生听说现在在给那个在纽约棒球队的日本球员做翻译。敏遇见他们非常的高兴，敏告诉我说那个男生在UB的日本人中声誉很高。出了地铁，我们在第五大道附近徘徊，因为找不到我们想要去的一家日本书店。忽然，敏开始和一个亚洲人说话，我一开始还以为敏只是找个一看起来像日本人的人问问看知不知道那个书店在什么地方。结果，那个人居然是在UB读书的一个在日本长大的中国人，他们互相认识。那个人就带我们去了那家书店，我们在书店里待了差不多2个小时，我买了两本书。于是敏说带我去一个叫Tribeca的地方，说是日本的杂志上有介绍，是个很不错的地方。可是，我们在那个区域里转了快两个小时却什么都没有看见。不知道是不是我们没有找到正确的地方，还是杂志把我们给骗了。总之，我们是累死了。于是决定去East Village吃东西。East Village是一个小区的名字，在那里有一条专门买日本食物的街，街边都是日本餐馆。那顿饭吃的还蛮好的，就是我们太累了。吃完饭后，我们就决定还是回法拉盛的好。正准备离开的时候，敏忽然又遇见了另一个日本朋友，听说是原来在一个高中读书的朋友。终于，我们回到了法拉盛，在回家之间，喝了杯冰茶。开车离开停车场的时候，Tadami忽然打电话来，原来他和女朋友正好也在那个停车场，看见我们的车开出去，忙给我们打招呼，可惜我们没看见。今天一天真是很热，很累，很奇怪 urlLink     urlLink
