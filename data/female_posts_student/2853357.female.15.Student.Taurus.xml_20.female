O.O  which reminds me... LOL dave is coming next year. i dunno why i suddenly remembered this now, but i did.    LOL.  wow, everybody must hate me for posting their pix. n im taking more tomorrow... prolly before the battle, and if i can get my mom to take pictures of the actual battle, that'll be cool. i think shes coming to watch, since shes dropping me off...  HELLA pix. that'll be cool...  lets find more pix to post up... since im procrastinating...           O.O    hmm... who sent this to me? i think it was- alisha. yes she sent it to me (and she did some lovely graffiti, i esp. like the label SCARY on davy...) and davy, btw, gina thinks alisha's your gf. XD! another fyi... i think so too! i'll ask rachel... she'll know... ;D  what else.... you know what, i have one last picture of my very perverted cousin when he wanst so... back in the day...    lol, rachel was bugging me this afternoon. she kept insisting that she didnt know who 'rachel' was and then i stopped talking to her and an hour or so later she fessed up. all powerful christina reigns AGAIN! MWAHAHAHA! I WIN!   o.o ok no...  lol, i gotta scan more pix. later...  i've had a recent obsession with pictures... i dont know why... but i do. and damn ryan took the camera today.  what other pictures mite there be, hidden in the files of my computer?
