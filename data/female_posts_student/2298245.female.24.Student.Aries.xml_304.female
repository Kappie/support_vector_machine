Toward the end of the story, I really lost it:   A spokeswoman for the park, which says "rhinos are not particularly intelligent animals" on its Web site...   At first I'm laughing, cause I'm thinking, "Uh, duh, that's pretty obvious from the story."  Then, I start thinking about the wording of the sentence.  And I wonder how long it will take the PETA folks to complain about the denigration of the reputation of rhinos.  But perhaps this is just paranoia on my part.  The link is via Alex Neckles' AIM profile.  And I like to give credit where it is due.
