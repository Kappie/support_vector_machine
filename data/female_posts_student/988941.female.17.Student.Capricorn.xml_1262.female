Nicki - in order to lay this whole gay thing to rest, i think we can come to the aggreement that the use of the word is wrong, when in the context of a way of describing something which is bad.  My day has been pretty depressing compared to the great holiday, but thats life. Hopefully tommrow will be better. talk to you all soon Dave
