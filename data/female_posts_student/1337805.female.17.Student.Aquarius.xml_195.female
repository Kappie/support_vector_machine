And I am also noticing I number things often :)  Firstly: Happy 17th Birthday Kellina, too bad you'll be too busy to care.       My birthday is next month, and during the same weekend, is a huge conference. My youth group is planning the youth part, and I've signed up to do as much as humainly could, trying to take over what Fiona would do too. This includes getting youth and organizing them Friday night, running a workshop Saturday morning, continuing that workshop throughout the afternoon, youth worship Saturday night, and helping to staff the youth room in between, and probably more. Now I have a meeting to go to with my YAC (the BC YAC) Friday night (somewhere) and a joint meeting sometime on Saturday. They are talknig about going to the church (almsot 20 minutes away from the Empress, where the conference is held) for the meetings, but my head is swimmmmming thinking on how I'm going to get back and forth. Grawwwahhh... I'm trying to get it all out of the way, and done with, as soon as I can, and arrange a schedule for myself for what I have to do. There's always so much pre-meeting stuff I have to do before a meeting, and there's pre-con prep, and post-con clean up..Gah! I'll die now.    Secondly: I am suffering from Snooping-mother syndrome.       My mother has a new hobby now. As much as I support her hobbies, I do NOT for this one. This one is gonig through my room, my personal stuff, finding my hiding spots, and searching for ANYTHING. There does not seem to be a pattern for what she is trying to find. It's getting ridiculous. Even the things I have in my locked box I have feared she has seen...It's awful. I have no private space anymore. It's getting to be a matter of time before she goes on my XP account on the computer and gose through my files and favorites. I'm waiting.      Of course, when she does that, I'll play "virus" with her computer, and move out. There is nothing funny at all about losing your privacy. None.    Thirdly: Wedding bells...       I have been invited as Tyler's date to his brother's wedding at the end of the month. I am nervous. I've already re-dyed my hair for it. I figured blue/green hair, as much as I loved it, would be kinda bad to have. I bleached it again, it's really blonde now. (And Laura's is glooooriously red!) I'm still nervous. I dunno what his family is like. I dunno what to wear. I don't have anything to wear. I'm so nervous. Doesn't help that I have con junk to do as well. *breeeeeathe*      The only fun part would be telling Adam and seeing his reaction. Mwahaha...I'm so evil.
