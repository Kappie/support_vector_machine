I hate going to the doctor's office.  I wish that they still made house calls.  It would be so much less uncomfortable if you could get a physical in your own home.  Well, maybe not - it may seem a little more perverted and creepy.  Less cold though.    I met with the pet sitter this morning.  She seemed very nice.  We've never used a pet sitter before, so I hope that it goes well.  If it does go well, it will be convenient for future trips.  I love having animals, but it's such a hassle to take care of them and travel.  I just worry about Bear snapping at her.  I gave her some dog treats to give him when she enters the house.  Hopefully that will calm him down a bit.  Father's Day was yesterday.  We went to Cynthiana and had dinner at the country club (at 12:30!!), then we all went home and changed, and went back to swim.  Dad, Mom, Robert and Aaron hit some golf balls on the golfing range before getting in the pool.  After swimming, we all came to Lexington to see a movie.  The boys went and saw "Chronicles of Riddick".  It's a sequal to a movie called "Pitch Black".  I haven't seen either, and can't say that I care to.  Us girls saw "Terminal" with Tom Hanks.  It was okay.  Not as good as I had hoped.  After that we went to Ted's Montana Grill and had some burgers.  That restaurant rocks.  The food is fabulous (buffalo), and the ambiance is beautiful.  It's reminiscent of the 1920's - the way the waiters dress, the lighting, the booths, the water pitchers, the music...everything.  I loved it.  I think that dad had a good day, but overall I'm sure that he would have preferred to stay home and rest.  He works soooo hard.   I'm supposed to go to Faye's tomorrow night for Logan's first birthday party.  I don't know what time though.  She hasn't been on the IM all day.  I guess I'll find out tomorrow, if she's still doing it.    Robert and I had a great anniversary.  We spent the day doing things around town.  We decided that we didn't want to do anything extravegant because we're going on vacation on July 2.  We ate at Red Lobster, went to the bookstore, had desert at a quaint, small, expensive restaurant downtown, and went to see "Supersize Me" - which was hilarious, and incredibly sad.  After that we came home and watched "Wyatt Earp" until 3 am.  To most people our lives would seem unbelievably boring.  It's perfect for us though.  Perfect.  We had such a great anniversary.  We decided that for our fifth anniversary (in two years), we'll do something special.  Go somewhere.....California maybe?  That will probably happen before that anniversary though.  Maybe a bed and breakfast in Maine.  I've always wanted to go to Maine.  It looks so beautiful.    We're going to Baltimore and Washington DC in September, and Dallas in October.  I'm a little worried about my school schedule.  I figure that I can miss one day of classes per trip.  That's a bit much though, and hopefully I won't have any exams on the days that I'd have to miss.    Need to get directions to the Drs. office.     That's all for now.
