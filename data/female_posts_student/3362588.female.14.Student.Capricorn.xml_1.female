Yeah, I drove all 150 feet down and even drove around that really tight curve at the top!  I only killed the engine like 3 times (the truck's a stick shift and doesn't have power steering either, I'm so good.  haha).  I *ahem* did almost run into the embankment, but you don't need to mention that.  haha.   *gasp*  Here comes dad...  I'm supposed to be doing a report on Egypt and the Ottoman Empire.  Must run... fast... Signing off - Jack the Really Ausome Driver  P.S.  Darn, I have to wait till next year to get my permit...  awwww....  maybe i can drive up by round valley lake.... hmmmmm  P.P.S  Don't tell my mom ;o)  haha
