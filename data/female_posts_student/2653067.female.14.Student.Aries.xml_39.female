The first stop was at the Ice cream parlour because I had promised to purchase Vanessa a     Mango   icecream cone for being my driver. After the ice cream stop, we drove down 56th and then phoned Sam to ask for directions. We got lost due to our old expired map. We eventually got to Sam's household.    The stay at Sam's house was quite all right. I drank approximately 6 and a half glasses of water, went on the computer for a long time and listened to awsome music. Panago Pizza and Salad was served for dinner. I must say, It was really good until the salad dressing and cheese started to smell really bad. The Wedge came at Eight. "Hard to explain" By  urlLink The Strokes  and "D.U.I" By  urlLink HarMarSuperstar  were some highlights of the show. Hard to explain was great and D.U.I was just hilarious. It was really ironic because me and Sam were talking about The Strokes and Hard to explain and it came on. Another ironic moment is when D.U.I came on because Sam was telling me that she was thinking of requesting one of HarMar's songs. Yep... it was really great.    I'm really happy that I got to see that episode twice! It's one of myfavorite shows and I always look forward to new episodes. Well, that's all for now chums. Bye!   And remember kids.. "Who's got the crack?" truly is a work of art.
