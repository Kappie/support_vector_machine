I guess I should introduce myself.  I am Jami, I am going to be a junior in high school, and I am a band geek (have been for about 6 years).  I am first chair sax and I am teaching myself piano.  I also am bipolar.  For those who don't know what that is, it's when you have a chemical imbalance in your brain and your moods change uncontrollably.  I can be happy and nice one minute, and the next I look like someone off of the exorcist.  I am trying to controll it, but it's hard, the teenager in me doesn't really help it either.  OO boy, those teenage years, they're killer. LOL  Soo, I guess I'm introduced for now.  I just have to say im a very weird peron, I am an off and on again Wiccan, and I am kinda worried about my sexuality.  Let's put it this way, I know I'm not a lesbian, but i have fantasies... NEWAYZ....  That's not something to talk about on a blog....  I guess I have freaked out over half my audience by now..  So I'll write in here later!!!    Peace and much love,                 Jami
