Good job boys, very creative! I broke my toe I think. how sad! anyway, back to the good stuff. i think tonite was the first time i ever gagged at church. WAIT, no, mayo-filled do-nuts was the first time i gagged at church. that was just nasty. i saw some kid get nailed in the face was a bag full of chum! that was hilarious! even after a shower I can still smell the clam juice or whatever that rank stuff was.  Oh, another bonus was seeing Dustin run like the wind. that guy has got speed. then after one race he's done for! but i did miss the youth workers who werent there. Especially randy! i know he would have made it a lot more fun!! not that he would have been the only one!!  well people the best of part of the day would have to be gettin my classes for my senoir year! get this 3 days a week i only have two classes!! how great is that. Anderson College classes and early dismissal absolutely rock my sox off!! wow!!! aight, i'm going to bed. tonite wore me out!! time for some shut eye!! have a great day ya'll!   PS- advice for the day- dont throw bark, it'll put someone's eye out. *Rachel West*  PSS- is anyone's hotmail account not letting them log in so they can check their email or is it just mine?
