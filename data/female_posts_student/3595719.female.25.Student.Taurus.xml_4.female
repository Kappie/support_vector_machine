	 
      Lying in despair as bitter thoughts consume me
Drowing in a pool of tears
Reaching out to taste your agony.
A reflection of dust as I look in the mirror
Confusion swims through my veins 
Ending with blisters at my fingers tips.
Your face I remember,
Engraved in my heart
A hope that is lost, farewell you had said.
Our love always remembered
My friend I will miss
As a Hypnotic Blur it started
In a Tragic Style it ended......
