I'd like to hear what other people think on it. By the way Max, I didn't mean to kick you earlier it was a reflex action for you hitting me delibaratly around the head. So what would I like your views on? Well, I found out late about Columbia and when I was talking to Max about it all he said was 'o well shit happens'. I find that very disrespectful and rude. Its isn't everyday a space shuttle which was on a very important mission is destroyed and its crew killed. I could understand if it were a car accident because they do happen everyday. Put it this way Max, (and to Nic or anyone else I don't mean to upste you or be rude) if someone you cared about, ie Nic, was killed weather it be a car accident or not you would be extremly upset and greviving and would not want people tos hurg and go 'o wel;l, shit happens'. Thats like saying it doesn't matter. Ist like their deaths don't matter, or the crash itself doesn't matter. What about their families? 4 of them were married, what about their children? They have to grow up without a dad and that is something extremly hard to do. Then theres the space program itself, that will be put on hold now for a long long time. There are people in space now from Russia. The space station, also a very important project, what will happen to that? This has an on going affect, its isn't just 'shit happens'.  Argh, why don't you guys think before you say things?  -edit- Excuse me Jo? How can you come on here saying how all we talk about is depressing stuff when throughtout today and past week or so whenever I talk to you your always depressed! And you never give me a reason either!  "You can't go around being all depressed all the time, life goes on"  ha, thats a bit rich isn't it. I thought we were good frineds, so how come you never talk to me.
