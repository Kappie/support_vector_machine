We were at Jered's picking the boys up a long time later (after running around like losers getting cute so we wouldn't end up being late) when I pulled out LeRoy.  LeRoy is my lego man that was in my toothbrush.  They ran him over with a car and then thru him out the window!!! I was and am very upset.  Then Stupid Jacob decides he doesn't want to go.  Oh, this is after Jered "forgot his wallet at home" and we turned around.  I don't remember him getting his wallet, but hey, you never know.  Then we start on our journey to some place in Morris to eat.  Jered has this brilliant idea to eat at "this one place he took Jordan sometime."  We finally find it, and the place is called Petey's.  Stefany and I went there one time and had a waiter that was left-handed and looked like Greg Brady.  It turns out that Greg wasn't there, but Jordan is!!!  How amazing.  He is with other people, but I am too lazy to name them.  So we walk in and Jordan decides that I would be jealous if he flirts with this girl, but of course I don't like him like that and I don't get jealous.  I pull out Jacob's sunglasses and put them on the table in front of an empty chair and announce that we are pretending that is Jacob.  Jordan completely ignored me the whole time, while acknowledging everyone else there.  How cool of him.  I haven't talked to him at all, but the last I heard I am a slut and a "witch."  Now, I think that is better than being a porn-liking, unilip having, dumb ex-boyfriend of Christen Marie Bertrand.  But that's just me.
