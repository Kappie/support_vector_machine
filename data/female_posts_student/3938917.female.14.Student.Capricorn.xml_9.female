If I could open up my heart and let him out I would never have to sing his name aloud. It was your "hello" that kept me hanging on every word and your "good-bye" that keeps me listening for your voice around each corner. I'll sing songs to help me stay up all night. I don't want to go to sleep. I'l sing songs and hope you're listening carefully and know exactly what I mean. It's the song you must seek out when your night has just began. In the distance you can find the lips from which was sung a melody.--      Not many Mondays of mine are very exciting, including this one. I pulled weeds for a couple of hours and planted a few trees...yard work whoo...and that's about all. Tomorrow Tyler's coming home, he should be back Wednesday...and I have to go to my step-grandma's funeral...yay. But then maybe I'll get to see him...hopefully, lol he got me some presents. But that's all that's went on...so I'm going to finish my talking and then go to bed...but first I'll leave you with some thoughts I wrote out earlier, lol it's kind of a short story...oh well.       **I walk hand-in-hand with life's uncertainty, wanting one thing one minute and something completely different the next. A fickle mind can easily get a girl in trouble, leading her into dangerous corners she's never entered before. But there's one thing that stay's constant; my need for you.      I'd truthfully rather be uncertain about you too, noting the sick, painful consequences of your actions. Wanting you is just a subtle way of asking for death. You've killed me before, and oh did you ever pull it off with grace; a style all your own. Just the thought makes me shake, and sure you hate to see me tremble, but it didn't stop you.       It's as if you feast on my heart, cold though it may be. So many things done to create the lifelessness inside, and yet it's always my fault. I wasn't made like a robot. Such a shame that I can't turn off my emotions with the click of a switch. Too bad, I'd make myself like stone, putting an end to the fear, anger, sorrow, hate, and even the love that got me there in the first place.      It generally starts with my glass dreams. Just fragile thoughts, uncertain at first, but once settled become essential. And with every start there's an end, so being the sudden shatter of the once beautiful needs that in all actuality aren't needed at all. They lead on to envy and jealousy, two of life's greatest enemies; predator's of the heart slowly consuming every bit of feeling you own, and if they're going to do it, I wish they'd get it over with so that I can dry my eyes and walk on, only to run into a new and more difficult scenario that will once more make me feel alive to only kill me again. Oh well, it's just a game I've not mastered yet; no one has.      It's not possible to become rich from Monopoly of the heart.
