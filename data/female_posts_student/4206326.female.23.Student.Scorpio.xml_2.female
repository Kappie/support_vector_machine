And Oh, the price I paid, for all the love I never made, Someone wrote up on the walll.  "Oh, how mighty is my pen, If this is everywhere it's been?" Yes the wines delicious but I'm needing something stronger, I growing suspicious that I woun't be here much longer And it feels like I'm going down again. It feel like I've lost my ownly friend.  Crawling home from some saloon, And all my strings are out of tune, no one's around to break my fall. No attempt was ever made, So I slowly decade have a little faith in me that's all.  How mightly am I then,  If this is everywhere I've been And as the daylight broke I cast no shadow on the wall, I will disinigrate untill there's nothing left at all Feels like I'm going down again, Feels like I've lost my only friend.  And I never thought I see the day My heros all became phycotics My drugs are all exspensive exotics My blood is thick with antibiotics So I toss the coin to fate, it's only right Take no blame so I can sleep so tight, You know that out of mind is also out of sight.  And as the laylight broke I cast no shadow on the wall I pass the closed apartment door in rows along the hall Feels like I'm going down again, feels like I've lost my only friend.
