It's a train in the sky!!!! That's wrong!!! So anywho, the reason why I hate this is because I got confused and didn't get of at the right station. Well...I did, but I wanted to get off at a different station, it's a complicated story.  So I was in Burnaby today, cutting the grass at my dad's work area and I decided to think. First thing that popped into my head is how different I am from my family! It's so true!!! I mean, look at it, my entire family needs glasses! I, on the other hand, don't. I'm really artistic when it comes to things. For example, our model train set. My new train set I'm working on I'm more dedicated to detail. Same with photography and filming, I love to get the art side of things.   Second thing I thought of was envy...  The movie   Envy   is about two good friends.   Ben Stiller  , who plays one of the friends, is a hard working guy dedicated to his work. The other friend,   Jack Black   plays some easy going slacker. All of the sudden, he thinks of this wack idea and Stiller decides not to join in and Black become rich. This scenario is almost like my life. I know I shouldn't be envy or anything, and I'm really not, but I am. Why? Dyllan has this great job and now he's going to get a great car. I can't get a decent job and I have no money for a car! I know I know it's stupid, but it does make me a little jealous. But I'm happy for the guy. I'm trying to put it behind me and just ignore it, but I saw poor Speedy Reidy just sitting there. Made me wish I had money.  Third thing I thought about was camp. Can I really afford to take a week of from life? In times like these where I need money for car insurance? When I need to find a good paying job? When I need to start saving for post secondary? Can I afford it? Literally, can I afford that much money? The answer is no! I can't afford to take a week of from life! I can't afford the $290 dollars! I haven't realized but the real world is coming soon, and I'm not going to be prepared to face it. It's hard to believe that I have so much going on inside that my friends don't even know, and that I don't even know. Luckily, I have Jesus on my side. He's cheering me on from the sidelines. Couldn't ask for a better fan. So what to do? Skip camp? Maybe, I'll pray. If God wants me to go, then I'll go.  On my trip home, I think I was given a sign. My dad gave me a company cheque for cutting the grass. I'm expecting a small number such as $20. I look at it, and I see a cheque for $100!! Just my luck too! I need $133 more to go to camp! So who knows! Maybe I should go to camp!   Oh yeah! I hate East Side Vancouver!!! To Big and confusing! Oh yeah, Steph. In the last 10 posts, I've posted the most! Who posts more now!?! I think I'm addicted to Subway cookies too! Just like Marey Kate and cocaine
