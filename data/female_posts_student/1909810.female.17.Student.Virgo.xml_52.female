I promise I'll stop talking about my grades all the time, I've just been so fixated on GPA's for the last couple years, I can't get myself to stop...it doesn't work.    We might change the play we are doing for the one act, or we'll just have to tell people to come to rehearsals *sigh* this happens every time and it pisses me off.  But she should have picked an actual one act in the first place...so she wouldn't have to cut out so many fucking parts, that also makes me angry.  But whatever.  There's this one that I would like to do, I don't remember what it's called, but it's a mother, father and a daughter, and it's funny, and I would like to do it but I'm not the person that gets to decide these things.  But if she did i would have a huge part, haha i'm a loser but sometimes I think she doesn't think I can pull things off, which surprises me considering me I'm [i]one[/i] of the only ones that is completely dedicated when we do playsHopefully she doesn't just call it off completely, it's fun going to phoenix for competition, although I only went once and all I did was the lights...or really just push a button, but it was fun.  I wish Amber wasn't doing Godspell at theatrikos, then she would be able to do the one act also, and that would be great fun :D buut oh well, I'll deffinately go see her perform.
