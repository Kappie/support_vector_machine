Thirty minutes ago, I wrote, "it's two-thirty in the pm and I am still in bed."  Thus began a rather lengthy post that was erased only two minutes ago by some mysterious combination of key strokes, which I have yet to understand.  It's funny that I should consider that half-hour wasted as much of that post was spent saying that I had abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do today.  I was so annoyed when I couldn't recover the lost text that I actually got out of bed, relieved my strained bladder and attempted to take a shower.  There was, however, no hot water.  So here I am back in bed. Writing in my blog again.  I wish I could smoke.  But that would require getting dressed and going down to the corner market, as I am fresh out of smokes.    I don't really feel like reconstructing the lost-post, which is too bad, because it had some wry observations concerning the nature of sundays, the odors of ex-boyfriends, and the mis-ordering of items on my list of priorities.  Sigh. I really don't have much else to write though.  I hate sundays.  I always have.   Well, maybe the hot water is working now.  I suppose I should go investigate.  Two quick things before I go.  1) some one posted comments.  Actually two someones.  that was pretty cool.    2) it's weird to think of parents as people.  a lot of blogs that I have been reading lately are the personal diaries of parents.  But not parents, qua parenting, but rather ordinary people who happen to be parents (see, e.g.,  urlLink fire on the lawn ).  I guess I know that my mother and father have lives outside of their relationships with my brother and me, but it's weird to think of them swearing, or discussing their lost ambition, or frustration over writer's block, etc.  Of course, if I ever have kids I don't plan on sacrificing  my  identity, though my children will, of course, become incorporated into that image of self.  But still, it trips me out a little bit, because I have a heard time viewing my parents from a perspective other than the perspective I see as their daughter.  Perhaps that is because I would never want them to see me as a I see myself.  I have a very carefully groomed image that I present to them. It has just enough flaws to make it seem real, but not enough to tip them off to the troubled self that lies beneath.  Perhaps they do the same thing.  My mother, in fact, was on prozac last year, or so I believe.  I am not sure if she was seeing a counselor because she didn't discuss it with me.  I myself was seeing a counselor at The Law School, the result of a near nervous breakdown and a month of insomnia.  I have not (yet) managed to get a prescription for prozac, but I do have sleeping pills.  I think I will start back up with counseling when I get back to school and try to get some anti-depressants though.  I  oscillate on whether or not I really need them, I probably don't, but I have to admit I am extremely curious.  Anyway, the point of bringing that up is that I didn't tell my mother about my problems either.    okay.  time for a shower. I really don't smell very good.
