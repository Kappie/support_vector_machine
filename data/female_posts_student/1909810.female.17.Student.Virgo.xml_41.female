Schmidt came! yay, he still doesn't have my pictures for me...I'm getting quite impatient.  Amber did a wonderful job, holy shit...she amazes me.  The lights were shit though...really bad, whatever. And Brittany is pretty much...a bitch but hey thats ok.  I'm just rambling.  I donno.  I think I did well on my math quiz today...but I thought that before and woah did it turn out to be a bad day for me.  My brother is here this weekend, but he won't be coming to the show...which makes me a little dissapointed but oh well right? I'm having fun. I am. And that's nice for me :) although I am a little sick, I only went to 5th and 6th hour today which was lovely.  I have so much homework for this weekend I dont know what to do with myself, ah well. I'm not gonna stress about it.  I don't want to feel stressed anymore.  It's really not pleasant.  I have all day sunday to do it.  So that's what I'll do sunday, homework, and tonight and tomorrow I won't worry about it at all.  But see, I have to say these things over and over to myself before I really start taking my own thoughts seriously.     Amber's not gonna go to the one act competition, I'm kind of dissapointed, but I am happy for her that she's in Godspell at theatrikos, that should be fun for her.  Hopefully she'll do the spring play or I'll never be in a show with her again and I'll just have to start crying, I hate when people leave!  people ALWAYS leave, I'm always the last...stuck behind, by myself. That's one thing that I won't be looking forward to for my senior year.  I don't want to be the oldest, I don't like it.  I like being the younger one :) I know...I'm a freak. But that's me.  Well...I'm off...
