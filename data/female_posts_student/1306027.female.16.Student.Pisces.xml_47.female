Went to the doc's yesterday to find that out... they took a bunch of crappy tests like the ekg (Ok, yea this doesn't hurt or anything but it's weird because your laying shirtless on a freaking cold examination bed while the nurses chat on about whatever while putting the little sensory things around your exposed upper body.) Apparently my heart wasn't the problem. The doc man seems to think that my asthma, in wake of my killer flu, has decided to try and close my lungs. Nice huh? So here I am having all these stupid breathing problems. I wish I had never gotten sick to begin with. It all started with cellulitus early December, then progressed until I was totally spent. I am so tired, still coughing my brains out, and on millions of meds.    Apart from my illness spat  I'm pretty good. Been laying around watching some movies like  Shrek  and  Cutthroat Island . Did I ever mention that I adore pirate movies? Don't ask why... just another fetish of mine. Where's my life of adventure ey?! Where's my irresistibly hot pirate-man? *sigh* Did I mention that I hate being sick?    Graphically Speaking  I've gotten some stuff done! I made some new brushes for ps, mostly out of traffic signs and yummy pics of Orlando Bloom. Dude- there is this one pic of him... and he has his makeup all funkish, which is kinda weird but doesn't diminish his good looking-ness. I like Orlando Bloom. I think he's hot. But then again, who doesn't? I wish I could meet him.. just once, to see what kinda personality went with the face. I hate that publicity makes every actor and actress look so untouchable, just like, their not a person. Maybe I'll become an actress one day just to see how all the other ones live their lives.    Well  I must go... and I know that brings a tear to your eye but you'll get over it as soon as  Smallville  comes on ;-D
