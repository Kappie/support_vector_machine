Many A-list Hollywood types, trying hard to be indie at Sundance, were spotted carrying  urlLink Oral Fixation Mints . They come in chi chi flavors like Mojito Mint and Caffeinated Chai with each mint inscribed "FIX" on one side, and a little symbol for each flavor on the other. The slim brushed metal tins look like packs of  urlLink Dunhills  and OralFix suggests they be re-used as wallets when the mints are gone. $3.50 is kind of steep for 40 mints, so yes I think I will be using the cases as little sachets for my purse.   You can get a mix and match box of 12 tins for $30 at  urlLink OralFix .
