We'll have my grandma, my Aunt Carol, Uncle Marty, Aunt Brenda, Reese and Julie over.. headache waiting to happen..     Nancy Drew.... I want the new cd. Secret of Shadow Ranch. They can't make up their minds, can they... It's out, it's shipping.. people already have it!   How Come I Can't Find It?!    Ok.. I'll calm down now. I just really want it... and I'm really confused as to whether it's out or not...   I think I need to get off here... and.. get my fingers warm. brr.
