But I promise I won't eat him. The bugger jumped out of his bowl tonight, and I thought for sure he'd be dead. I started looking for him because I really didn't want him to start rotting in my room,...when I found him behind my TV, he was still flipping around when I picked him up! Wow, he's strong! He's back in his bowl, and I have a movie on top of it so he won't get out again. I did leave some room for air though. I hope he can't sneak through.  I went to GT with Ashley and bought a pair of pants, and almost a set of pj's that were on the sale rack for 3 dollars, they said "Hello, my name is Superstar". But the undies looked like they were something out of a porno, so I passed them up. Plus, they were neon green, not quite my colour.  I hope everyone has a great weekend. My favourite uncle is coming here Saturday so I'm very excited. I'll be spending as much time with him as possible. I miss him so much.  Gus is stealing my socks, and I need to get to bed. Going into work again at 8am.  Sleep tight.  -"i'd say you were perfect, but you wouldn't believe me."     -"if in your eyes i am, then i will take it and keep that thought in my pocket."
