So this morning at the ostensibly reasonable and drug-free hour of 9:45 a.m. some lunatic kicked my dog when I was walking him on 5th avenue.  And I blame New York.  The dog was lagging behind me, and the guy was approaching behind us.  I didn't really notice him at first.  But then there was a little thump and the puppy skidded into my leg.  My first instinct was to yell "WHAT THE FUCK!" at him, but then he gave me this look that said, basically, "I am crazy, may or may not be on PCP, and I might be carrying a knife, and I definitely don't plan on apologizing for kicking your dog, or even accepting your outrage graciously"  So I kept my mouth shut.  Then he set off down the street, zig-zagging back and forth from the sidewalk into the street.  He kept looking back at me, and when he was a safe distance I gave him my best hairy-eyeball.    I felt like I was going to cry, even though my cocker spaniel Beausoleil recovered immediately.  He was a rescue and I suspect maybe it is not the first time he's been kicked. I was a big mess until I saw one of my dog friends whose name I don't know because she is known only as Black and White Basset Hound Girl, which is good enough.  I told her the story, and she was outraged and observed that Beausoleil seemed to be ok.  Then I felt better and went and bought some 1% milk and the Daily News at the Carroll street bodega.  So anyhow, I blame New York.  Sometimes I get so sick of how the maniacs seem to own the streets in this god-forsaken city, even before 10 a.m. on a Saturday, and you have to be always watching out for them.  Watch out for me, motherfucker!  I wish.
