What should I write about in this space? Should I tell you about my ex-boyfriend, how his memory continues to break me, even after he abdicated from my love? Should I discuss the weather, the change of colors and climate? Perhaps, I could write about my indecisiveness regarding the future; professional and personal?  With each passing day, I am becoming more of an introvert, more shy with the world. I enjoy my new-found solitude, but I would be lying if I did not admit that there are times when the loneliness hits me hard. There are times when I wish for a companion, preferably of the male variety. I want a man in my life, not for sex or romantic love, but for friendship, for those times when I need strong arms to hold me.  I am fully aware of my faults. I am stubborn, tempermental, loud, obsessive compulsive, and a hopeless romantic. I am passionate, almost to the point of being militant, about certain issues. I have no problem with expressing my opinion, to an individual or a crowd of people. I am an emotional eater. I have a vulgar sense of humor and a tendency to use excessive amounts of profanity in any given situation.  I am picky about spelling, punctuation, and style.  For all of my faults, I have just as many good qualities. I am intelligent. I write a mean research paper. I try to see beauty in everything. I have strong faith. I like to give back to my community. I want to make the world a better place to live, especially for women and children. I want to be a role model for young girls who are searching for an idenity in this crazy messed-up world. I am compassionate and giving. I put my all into my friendships and relationships. I love sex. (Of course there are some individuals who would argue that this is a negative quality. Screw them.) I am honest. Also, while I may never win the Miss America pagent and I know that I have some weight to lose, I do not believe that I am hard on the eyes. I can look myself in the mirror and see a valuable woman who posesses beauty, even if it is of the inward variety.  I am not perfect, but I have worth.
