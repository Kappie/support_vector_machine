They're mongrels, every last one of them.    I don't think there is a single one of them that could  urlLink pass even the simplest IQ test .  Honestly, I don't get paid enough money to sit here and listen to their mindless drivel, and corny jokes for seven hours a day.  I especially can't handle the fact that I have to sit in the cube next to the grosso wheelchair guy.  He always smells like piss and clips his fingernails at his desk, but the worst part is  his fucking fingernail shrapnel lands on my desk!  Ew! Ew! Ew!  I'm sure he hasn't realized the  urlLink science and art that is fingernail clipping .  One day when both my mom and I are out sick (or even on a weekend), I hope this f'n building burns down...no wait, I hope it implodes, some how that seems cooler.
