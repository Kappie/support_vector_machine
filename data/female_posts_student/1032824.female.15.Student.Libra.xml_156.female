I have been yearning to realise how incredibly strict Miss Low can be when it comes to marking our tests. She did a great job in failing me man. Haha. I'll never forget this 2/25. My lowest in my entire life! Woo!    Stupid gong gong , who am I kidding, of course I feel disappointed,  bloody hell , but failing is part and parcel of life. You're a loser until you pick yourself up and continue to persevere in the battle. On a brighter note.. 2/25 wasn't the lowest, and if I'm not mistaken, nobody passed the test.   I'm so looking forward to the weekend, an emphasis on the "so". The UG camp is on friday, and if nothing goes wrong, my kids' NCO camp would be during the early holidays. Yipee! I have a fetish for camps; the stayovers, munching and gossiping, creepy sentry duties. I love doing stuff like this, just relaxing and staying peaceful, outdoors.   Alrighty.. Nono is leaving soon, in a few days to be exact. As much as Nana is gonna miss him, I will, too. Nana showed me the pictures we took the other day, many of em' couldn't be developed because there wasn't any flash.  On the other hand, the other photos turned out really fab :) I wish we could hang out somemore though...
