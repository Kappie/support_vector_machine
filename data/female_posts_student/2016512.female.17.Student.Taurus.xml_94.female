I've got a 2-0 record right now. i think i'm okay with losing. i was proud of yesterdays victory over Darien. i can't believe he doesn't know the meaning of "synopsis" and "animosity." You'd think he'd have a good vocabulary considering he got a 32 on his ACT. *cough* I'm soo tired. I've accumulated 11 hrs of sleep over the last two nights. that's definately not enough.  I gave blood today. I feel like i actually helped a life, while recieving a free cookie and t-shirt. *wink* I can feel a bruise coming on, but other than that i'm alright. Other news...my car died twice yesterday. Kind of frightening but i'm surviving. i don't think she'll last much longer. I feel bad because she's still nameless.  oh g2g play...  Tra la la a mcdonald's life for me? -Betso
