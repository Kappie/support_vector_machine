The troll was making a demonstration about how when people say stuff at different levels it means something different. Like, the same exact sentence can be said at 2 different volumes and mean different things. He was like "Whispering I love you is taken more seriously. What would you think if a boy just yelled I love you in your ear?" and right when he started to yell it this huge crack of thunder happened and it was all so loud between him yelling and the thunder that half of us jumped out of our skin. It was pretty funny. And then he said something in spanish and was like "did you understand that? no, because its not in your 'field of experience'."Which is what he was teaching us. He was talking all about our fields of experience and then he asked this kid Trevor if he understood what he said in spanish and Trevor was like "No." so the troll goes "Right, because its not in your field of experience, its not english, its mexican" Nice job, troll. The language is spanish not mexican.
