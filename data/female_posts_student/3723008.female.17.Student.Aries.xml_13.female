Someone once told me that when they spend too much time with themself... that they get depressed... and its happening to me these days.. Due to my newfound Insomnia.... I'm awake at all hours of the morning, contemplating myself and life ... and it depresses me.. cuz when I start to think... I think about..... stuff... and him ... and stuff.. and him ... and I don't like that... For once in my life... I'm hardly going out.... Usually I would be in Chaguanas almost every day.... I went.. once last week.. twice the week before.. and I haven't gone since Thursday.... I duno.. I think that I'm losing all zeal for this thing called life... and right now I'm just dragging myself through the motions that I've grown accustomed to ... Nothing new.. Nothing fun.. Nothing spontaneous... I'm getting boring in my old age... haha... probably first and only amusing part in this entire post... Going to see the utter bullshit known as Spiderman 2 .. again.. tomorrow.. and Wednesday I may be going to the Wild Fowl Trust.. it all depends on how good my cousin behaves... according to my Aunt... bleh... I feel so not in the mood for anything fun right now.. then again.. its 2am... ffff... I think I gonna sleep... try to sleep off this thing.... Later Toads...      In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Santi  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit..      Semper Fidelis Always Faithful..
