AFTER I had busted my ass to get the assignment done.  I wanted to sleep in, but couldn't if I wanted to have a parking spot.  :-(  Then I figured I would just use the extra time from not having my first class to study for my test in World Civilization.  But, of course THAT got postponed.  So, I will have my stupid World Civ test tomorrow.  I think I'm ready.  Of course, I'm not a particular fan of history, so it's kinda boring to me.  I dunno, the professor said to use the book's website quizzes to study, because he actually reworded some of the questions on the text's quiz to put it on OUR test.  YAY!  Ugh!  Anyway, today was a pretty good day.  I saw Mike Prewoznik as I was walking to the building of my first class today, and we sat and chatted and he played a bunch of songs on his guitar for me.  It was cool.  Then he walked me to class.  It was a weird feeling... I dunno... I'm absolutely sure there's nothing to it... it was just weird to be around Mike in that sense.  Anyhow, Friday is my first Psychology exam.  Wish me luck.  4 chapters of stuff, and I think the most demanding and most horrible will be the chapter about the brain and nervous system... ACK!  Um, what else?  Not much.  That weird guy "Danny" from Judson called me again the other night wanting me to go out on a date with him.  He kinda gives me the creeps.  I think I may block his number or something.  Okay, nothing else going on right now.  I'm not even going to attempt adding the commenter thing on here, because it ISN'T WORKING!  Any suggestions about this can be sent to me via email... and I'd actually really really REALLY appreciate it... ;-)  Email me at DRUMR158@hotmail.com  Laters people.
