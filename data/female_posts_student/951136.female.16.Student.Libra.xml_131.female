Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow... Every step that I take is another mistake to you...  I've become so numb, I can't feel you there I've become so tired, so much more aware By becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you  Can't you see that you're smothering me? Cuz everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart right in front of you... Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow... Every step that I take is another mistake to you... Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow... And every second I braced is more than I can take!  I've become so numb, I can't feel you there I've become so tired, so much more aware By becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you  And I know I may end the feeling too But I know you were just like me when someone disappointed in you...  I've become so numb, I can't feel you there I've become so tired, so much more aware By becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you
