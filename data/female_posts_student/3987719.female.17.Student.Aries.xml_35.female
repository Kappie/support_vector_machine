Yesterday, Sidney Ponson pitched a shaky game, allowing far too many base runners and pitches in the middle of the plate, yet he managed to pull out the victory and end his 9 game losing streak. This game brings hope of a better 2nd half for Ponson, who was one of the biggest disappointments in the first half, as far as free agent signings are concerned.   This afternoon, the orioles jumped all over Royals starter Zack Grenike, tagging him for 8 runs, including 4 home runs. He was unable to record an out in the 3rd inning. This game was a major turn around from the last time he faced the Orioles, when he was able to change speeds much more effectively and pitched deep into the game. The newly acquired Karim Garcia (from the Mets for Mike DeJean) contributed with 2 home runs and 5 RBI. Daniel Cabrera, labored through 5 innings, but only allowed 2 earned runs.   The Orioles head to Boston where they will play 3 games in two days. The pitching matchup for tomorrow features Erik Bedard vs Pedro Martinez. For Thursday's double header, Rodrigo Lopez will pitch one of the games, and either Dave Borkowski will pitch the other game on short rest, or a minor leaguer will be called up.
