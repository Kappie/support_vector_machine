Which is hard to believe however, I'm happy to have 2003 over and done with, way to many bad things happened last year and the worst was lossing my grandfather to cancer in July.  It's still hard to come to terms that he's gone!!  This year I've decided not to make any resolutions however, I thought I'd make a do/want list of all the things for this new year!   Loss weight - I'll be having my gastric bypass surgery soon!   Follow the doctors orders to the T!!   Take my meds everyday without some stupid ass excuess!   Go back to school and finish with my accounting degree!   Spend more time with family and friends!   Spend less time on this stupid computer!   Finish all my cross stitch projects that I have started.   That's all I can think of for now!! I do know that within the next year my whole life is going to change and I'm gonna need some time to process it all which I know I'll be able to get through because I have so much love and support behind me which means more then I can ever say.   So with all that being said -- Cheers! Hope you have a Happy, Healthly, Loving New Years!
