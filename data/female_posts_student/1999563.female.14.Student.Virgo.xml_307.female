He also brought me up out of a HORIBBLE PIT, out of the miry clay and SET MY FEET UPON A ROCK, and established my steps. He hath put a new song in my mouth-praise to our God; many will see it and fear and will trust in the Lord!   How powerful that is.  Here I am crushed under the weight of the earth.  God saw me and he picked up the great weight of all the burdens that have ever afflicted me.  He carried me in the palm of his gentle hand slowly telling me that everything would be okay. Then he "Set my feet upon a rock!" A solid rock, ablissful heaven compared to life before. Now I fall into God even more then ever before. There is a new theme song for my life and its OVERFLOWING with Praise for GOD!
