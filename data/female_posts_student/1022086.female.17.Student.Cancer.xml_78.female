If you don't speak Spanish, let's leave it at the fact that my grandmother is driving me insane.  I cleared any outings for the day so as to be able to get more things done in peace. I wanted to stay home because I've been out entirely too much since school let out, and I haven't had time to rest yet, but rest at home simply doesn't seem like an option. Yesterday the idea was equal, but my mom was driving me insane, so I ended up spending most of the day out. Today, my grandmother is being a hypochondriac to the fullest, and she's driving me insane.   I'm trying to compile an Italian phrase book for Mr. Sizemore and the group from NHS going to Italy as they asked me to do it and I said I'd do it, but I have a terrible headache. My grandmother just needs to freakeding GO AWAY!!! Why can't I be in peace on my darned summer vacation, dead gummit?? The only way to have any bit of peace is to lock myself in my room and pretend to be dead... agh!!!   Otherwise, I've been working with paperwork all day, and I loathe the Italian Consulate evermore.   Anyhow, I just needed to vent on that.    I scheduled my senior pictures for October, and I feel old. At least they're scheduled, though! I think I will go for the simplest package possible, as I am truly not a picture person. I wasn't even going to do them, but then I realized that I don't ever really get professional pictures done, and these might just turn out good for a change, maybe. *knock on wood*  I have a hair appointment for the 10th of June at 1.15 pm... to cut my hair. Yes, I'm going to donate it finally, which means it's getting *gasp* cut. I'm already having emotional struggles about it, so I'm sure I'll cry a storm when it's actually time to let it go. My drive to get through this thing is simply the fact that I'll make a little girl very happy (or maybe 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 little girls-- my hair has gotten so long...).  I hope it won't look like crap once it's cut. I think I want to try a shag, but I'll follow the hair stylist dude's advice, for he did a very nice job advising my mom and cutting her hair, and besides, he's gay. Gay guys tend to give really good advice about stuff like that. Even if the hair looks like total schmite, it will grow back, so everything will be okay. I suppose the hard part is parting with an image of myself that I've become so comfortable with and used to.    I'll get over it eventually, really. Well, I'd better get back to the Italian writing... toodles!  Hey, blogger has photo hosting now! Duuuude!    urlLink    Testing 1-300. This is a sample picture from my computer. You can probably figure that out
