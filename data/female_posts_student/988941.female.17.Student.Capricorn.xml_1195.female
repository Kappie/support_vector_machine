Why is it that the day when your all supposed to be home faffing around your mother, giving her presents etc... that instead the Britsh all come out to Woolworths? Why is it that people don't buy cards or presents until the day they are needed? Why is it that everyone is buying their mother either Calendar Girls or Love Actually?? Seriously! We'vce sold like 10 copies of LA today already!!!!!!! Aaaah!!!  The thing that is most insane about today is that our old manager Pam booked Charlene and Dean a day off today. They are both off. Leaving us with 4 people in house until 2 when Lora goes. Leaving us with 3. 3 people. 2 people to work 3 tills which we refuse to do because you need at least noe person running around when needed but at the same time we have to do the charts etc... AAAAAAAAAAH.
