Tomorrow summer league starts! Yay! I can't wait. Come watch us beat Sauquoit on field 1 at the high school at 5:30.  Listening to: [Baby Blue by The Early November]  It's a faster growing green That flows through these leaves I have, I try I guess we'll be alright  Way to try I got a line for you from me, better nice A beautiful baby blue sky that's looking up at you Now watch it fade away  But it's okay to come around With nights like this are never ending I tried so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you were better   I know you want it all and you got me Sorry I never was everything you ever dreamed But kept at bay for just in case that day   But it's okay to come around With nights like this are never ending I tried so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you were better  I don't want you to love me anymore  With my bags packed and ready to go Nothing's ever hurt so much for me than to let you go With my bags packed and ready to go Nothing's ever hurt so much for me than to let you go
