Oh well, at least now I know I'm actually attending school this year. LOL. I still have to go in and talk to some guy about classes. In other news I finally got around to cleaning the interior of my car today. It was pretty gross... I don't even want to know what some of the spots are from. I also took it to Walmart and got some floor mats for it. Nothing too terribly exciting going on today. I did however receive an obscene postcard from Toddley that he sent from France. Apparently the kid had a run in with a barbed wire fence while he was there... All I can think is OUCH! Well I'm glad he's back and can't wait to see him! I gave Tyler a call... It feels like we haven't spoken in forever! I miss him...  I have decided that:     Maroon 5 rocks my world.    I am completely addicted to their latest release, She Will Be Loved. That song makes me happy and sad all at the same time if that makes any sense. In fact, I like it so much that I have been listening to it on repeat the entire time I have been writing this.  I still have more to clean though... Like I haven't done enough of that today! So I'm off... Tune in next time for some more completely random moments and another glimpse into my psyche. Whoa... Scary.
