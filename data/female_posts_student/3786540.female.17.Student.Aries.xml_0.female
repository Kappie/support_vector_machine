During the relationship he loved me showing him emotions and showing him how much i cared for him and stuff but at the end he just didnt want to hear it. I told peter that I wasn’t a virgin so he wouldn’t feel so uncomfortable peter and I ended up dating for a year in total. we had broken up four times, first because I told him I loved him and he got scared, this was after 4 months of dating and talking like every night, second because he cheated on me, third because he wanted to be a slut in his teens and wants to continue the relationship after I have finished yr 12. argh, he thought this was for the best, I didn’t, and I wanted him back :( I really loved him, sadly I tried everything to get him back, I kept in contact wit him and even though we broke up 12th of January all the way through February we still fucked and got wit each other. I thought it would hopefully get him back. I was wrong, instead he asked me if we could just be fuck buddies, who would wanna be fuck buddies, really after I have had such a good relationship wit him except for a few things that went wrong when he was drunk. I would rather be loved and have passionate sex rather than just meaningless sex. he said that he didn’t find anything wrong wit being fuck buddies because it was just a way of pleasuring us both. giving us both what we wanted but really all I wanted was him. I was too scared of losing him if I admitted this to him though. I had it in my head that if I told him this I would send him running. Today I finally admitted it to him, I told him how much all this sexbuddies fucks me up, I really only kept fucking him because I thought it would increase my chances of dating him again but now I realise that it was hopeless, and things would neva go back to the way they were again. it just don’t make sense, y did he dump me in January? he just said cause of yr 12 and if that was seriously the truth then he wouldn’t be still dating other chicks, geez. I just don’t get it, y does he do this? today I told him that he was just a friend and so he felt hurt cause I didn’t consider him to be a really really close friend. he told me that he thinks of me as one of his great friends... I don’t understand guyz at all. y does he do this? it’s just fucking wit my head. what does he want from me? I am really trying to get ova him but he’s always there. I now have another guy which is damn hot, but he just wants to be friends so I am cool wit that but I am trying to put him b4 peter so I don’t do absolutely anything with peter like I used to but I think I might give this other guy the wrong idea and let him think that I might like him or something, (which wouldn’t really be a bad thing). Damn he’s really hot though and he has the sweetest voice it’s not good, I think I kind of like him though, he talks to me so much its great. I just don’t know what to do about it.
