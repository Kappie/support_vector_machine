You're everything I hoped for You're everything I need  You are so beautiful to me  You are so beautiful to me You are so beautiful to me Can't you see?  You're everything I hoped for You're everything I need  You are so beautiful  To me.      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Saturday, March 20, 2004   I think I love him.  Laura tells us, "You guys can go outside, I don't care. I just don't want to watch it. It's gross."  He walks out the door, and goes down the stairs to the deck below.  I look at Laura, and wait a few moments, then follow. I open the door, and follow his path down the stairs, and see him standing near the wall.  I walk to him closer, and he wraps me in his arms, and kisses me. I kiss him back, shuddering because it is cold outside. He pulls me closer. My arm is around his back, the other pressed against his chest. His arms are on the small of my back, one creeps around and slowly is tracing the outline of my jeans, the other, pulling me closer to him with each kiss.  The hand finds the edge of my shirt, and travels up my back, sending tremors through my body as the cold air hits the exposed air, and at the feel of his touch. We kiss more, as time flies by around us.  We pull away, and I run inside. He sits beside me on the couch, and puts his arm around me, pulling me closer to him. He whisperes things in my ear, kissing my neck, cheek, earlobe. We all talk and laugh, and he sneaks in a kiss or there, here and then, carefully placed.  I couldn't imagine myself with him before, and now that we're together, I can't imagine how I got a long without him. And where this sweet side of him has been hiding.   I love you.     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Wednesday, March 17, 2004   I think I love him.  He's dreamy when we make out. He touches me, and he's always pulling me close. I feel so fragile around him, that he will make sure no evil will harm me. He'll protect me from all of the monsters in the dark, will always be there.  I never want to leave him. Ever. I love just hanging out with him, even if Laura doesn't let us make out in front of her. Life is perfect.   And then I found out that Mike is trying to ruin CanUUdle...  But then I think of Nick, and us together, and I know, somewhere in my heart, that my love for him is growing.   I love you.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Wednesday, March 10, 2004   Even better than Nick kissing me?   Me going out with him of course.  It was a long embarrassing block two today, I must admit, but it was definatly worth it in the end. Because now we're going out, I have a boyfriend, he's awesome, and I'm completely awestruck. Purely amazing.  Skipped both block two and block four today, neither teachers noticed, nor cared when they caught me later. Pure genius.   Today has been a day out of a picture book, an amazing adventure has begun.   And when Spring Break begins, all hell breaks loose.  Party on, my friends. Party hard. We've earned it.  *rocks out!*     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sunday, March 07, 2004   Nick kissed me last night.   We had sat through the movie cuddling (as well as you can in a movie theater), and holding hands...I cried on his shoulder, and he held me tight. On the way home, he put on Kim's lip gloss, and was being really goofy...resting his head on my shoulder...then he looked up and kissed me, just beside my lips...we held hands most of the way home. Going up Stelly's hill, he grabbed my face, and kissed me again on the cheek..:D  I'm falling in love..and I love it.
