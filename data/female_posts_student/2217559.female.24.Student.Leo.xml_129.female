Ugh, none the less, today's link is about ANOTHER priest and child pornography.  I just realized I haven't written in quite a few days. Just been busy I suppose. Jen came to visit me on Thursday afternoon and we had a wonderful 2 days. I have quit smoking and so I have been a little irritable. Poor girl, she didn't know what hit her, I don't think. I am feeling a little better with the occassional hair pulling nail biting craving.  I try not to give in.   School is going really well. I hav enow entered my first official week of government and aerobics.  We had our first full work out in Aerobics today and I swear there will be no excuse for me not to be skinny in 4 weeks. Hahaha. Of course, my mother has me on some weight loss diet plan right now. I am so hungry this afternoon that i could eat the pencil laying on my books. Nonethless, I am approaching dinner time and that's exciting. Hahaha. How pathetic I sound. Truly.  Hope all is well with everyone. Lisa mentioned an ECI Happy Hour on Friday - Maybe Trudy's, etc?  i would love to catch up with everyone and maybe I can talk Jen into coming along as well. I would love for everyone to meet her.   Ok, smooches. Shell.
