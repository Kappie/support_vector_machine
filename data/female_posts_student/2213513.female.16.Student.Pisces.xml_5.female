All my close friends know who that is...lol. Anyway, I'm really excited to start the snowboard season! I'm going to sunriver for thanksgiving, and it's crap because we only have 2 f-ing days for thanksgiving this year. But yeah, so I'm going to sunriver, which isn't always a plus...my moms boyfriend, who can be annoying, his parents live there, and they are nice but that means I have to spend a week with Mark, my moms boyfriend. Mark's kids, Teagan and Ben, are 16, a year older than me, and they are nice but Ben beats me up sometimes. I'll put stories on here periodicly. They have their licsenses, which would be helpful to me, you would think, but no, because they just got them...oh well, I'll be getting mine soon! Feb. 24th, thats when i turn the big 1-6! lol, but yeah, SO I'm really excited to go to sunriver this time because one of my bestest friends in the whole wide world is going to be in sunriver at the same time. So Lynzi and I are gonna plan a time to get together because I dont want to be stuck at that house all the time and I know she doesnt want to be stuck at hers either! This is it for now though, check back later! Later Gators! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play
