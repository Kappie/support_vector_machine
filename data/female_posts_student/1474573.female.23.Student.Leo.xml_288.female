I's be a gradjumacatin' studint!  Of course, I was on a three way call with my mother and my aunt last night and my mother goes on and on raving to her about her "super-smart daughter who was able to pass the VERY hard Spanish class" when my aunt stopped her dead in her tracks and asked, "So can she speak Spanish now?!"  Heh.  Um.  No...BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.    Riiiiight.
