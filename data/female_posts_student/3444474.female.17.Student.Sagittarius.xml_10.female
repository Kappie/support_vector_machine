Was kinda dull but meh, what can you do? It's not like any of my friends were there but there were some kids there that were like 15+ years of age, so I dealt with it.   July 4th family thing tomorrow, don't know whether to like the idea of it or hate it yet. Depends on who shows up from the fam. I hope my tio Papo comes, he's teh fucking cool, and really funny but my mom said he might not. My aunt Miriam (she's not really my aunt by blood, but by the fact that she's my cousin's mother) is coming with her baby *so cute* so that's a savior, and Cameron is coming over at around 8 to save me after dinner, lol.   In other news, I got a graduation card today from a friend of the family, it had $50 in it, I was stoked, lol. I wanna save up the rest of my grad money I get (and I'll get some tomorrow, I know it, lol) and get a digital camera, and now I'm on my way to doing that. I might take a little out of my paycheck next week too and do that.   :D  Oh joyous, bed soon, yay. Driving around in the morning running errands with my mom, weee.   Later :)
