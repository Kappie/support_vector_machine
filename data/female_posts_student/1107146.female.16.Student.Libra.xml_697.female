At the end of eighth period, Rob and I got up to talk like we usually do and I was talking about how I was going to the Choir Concert tonight, and he's like "Oh, I want to go with you!!"  Then this awful look comes across his face and he's like, "NO!! I have to work!!! Nooooo!!!!"  Kind of funny, but very nice at the same time.  *Sigh*  So, really it wasn't me, I just kind of instigated a bit.  But I want him to come to progressive dinner.  Oh well, he works all the time doesn't he?  Where does he work?  At some sportsplex thingy, I think.  Not sure.  Maybe I'll go pay him a visit ;)  Don't pray for snow till Friday night so I don't have to go to the Forensics tournament.  I need that day to work on my psych paper which, oh yeah, I haven't started yet.  Stupid Aetolia.  I love it.  Level 6 now, you know.  Almost 7.    Yeah, I really like that kid, can you tell?
