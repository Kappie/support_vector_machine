All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do    I feel tortured, I feel that I'm all gone My heart isn't a rock.Come on baby come and steal my siesta And all that you have I was dreaming of somewhere Away from here.      You didn’t forget me…at least immediately. Cause who are you… to tell me what to do? I will unwrap him just like a present and I will discard him just when I want to thank you But I’d rather I taste my desires of Earth and fill my mind with jewels for all they are worth than discover a diamond decays to a rock and time doesn’t turn.
