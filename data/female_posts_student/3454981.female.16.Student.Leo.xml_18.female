But I guess I should just get this over with...some of these questions I know the answers to, some of them I am really wondering about.      Oh, and if some of these are sort of like 'what is the meaning of life' then don't worry about having to answer.        1. Why did God create humansif he knewthat not all of us would make it to heaven?    2. What did I do to suddenly feel like I was deserted? (like He's probably still there, but I don't feel as close)    3. What about Evolution? I don't believe in macroevolution, but did God create microevolution so that we and the things around us could adapt? Because scientific evidence shows that things have adapted...ok this probably was not a fair question seeing as I almost positive that no scientist or whatever reads this blog.     4. Why were we created?     5. Humans will probably never be capable of understanding at any level, but I will always wonder how God came to be. Well, not be, how He  is.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?       There are so many other questions I have, but I'm drawing a blank, so I'll have to post them on here later.
