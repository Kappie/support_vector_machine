THAT IS SICK. COMPULSIVELY OBSESSIVELY SICK. i know rite?   U n i will both agree when i say it might just be the worst case of mental illness but whats worst is when ur filthy rich(asin who cheated their way to stardom, who DOESNOT deserve to have, what they have n they helpless try to put everyone under the magic spell of their "richness* " (supposedly) n wanting to make everyone their slave (emotionally) who need everyone to literally worship them) and u try to buy ppl, flauntin their filthy richness. THAt my fren is NOT the worst case.. THAt is Undpubtedly A GONE CASe. LITERALLY..   But the story  doesnot just end here dude nauuhh.. what happens is that some ppl fall under their spell, some compelled by greediness, some desparate for some used stuffs they might hopefully pick up thrown by the filthy ones. so they get caught in the trap they might never free themselves from(poor things). BUt thanks to the almighty there are still some ppl who won't give into the temptation n resist the fowl air of greed n materialism to stand up for their worth their right n values as a human beingwith morals. But when the goin gets tough the tough gets goin. so it reaches a point where things are over the top n intense with fury. what ends up happening?  filthy makes offensive remark abt something totally superficial which just can't be ignored since it is so painful (but ofcourse focused on  doin what they do the best filthy doesnot not understand umm... let me rephrase that.. doesnot HAVE the capability to think abt) that she can't hold back and sharply retorts back.......after a sec nothing but SILENCE REIGNS..OOUCHHH!!! that must have HUrt..OOOOoooooo SUCKA!  which eventually leads to me writing this shit in rage ULTIMATE RAGE I TELL U>>  ....that bitch  god i should do this more often infact everytime i'm angry i feel so much better already. pheww.. ppl note my point its more like a anger management thingie. seriously. ok i'm outtie here.. PEAce OUt .
