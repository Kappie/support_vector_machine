No I am not putting words into your mouth, that really is the answer. So anywho...I have just had this thought come to me...clever how now I shall type it out...*ponderment*  Have you ever met someone and known right from the start you would hate them? And in turn with that, have you ever met someone and known right from the start that you would love them or be friends with them forever?  I haven't. But I guess that such a happening can not be uncommon. And I also guess that if you met such a person, knowing that you would feel that way forever would be a great burden. Some might tell you it would have to be an excellent bit of knowledge. They might fancy it to be a wonderful moment of revealing bliss. But how could this be? Let me pose another question. How would it feel to look upon someone and know you could do nothing but hate them when they are enthralled with you? And in the same turn how would it feel to look upon someone and know that you would always love them, even if they grew to hate you, or grew to love someone that was not yourself?  Hence I dread meeting someone and knowing my feelings from the start. Raw emotion, I've noticed, never has a pleasant result. Only in fairy tales does love happen in a beautiful way. A hansome prince that half comes upon and half stalks a fair lady, and a 'chance' meeting at the end of which she is certain of her love for him and he is just as certain of his lover for her. And then someone, for some dreadful personal reason, does not want the two to be together. And so the antagonist, 'villain' if you will, does something horrid to prevent the two from coming together. But somehow the Prince manages to overcome whatever has put itself between him and his goal, and thus 'wins' or steals fair ladies heart.  And though the two 'lovebirds' have met but twice they ride off into the sunset, intwined in a loving embrace. and that is perfectly lovely, but it never happens. To find out Prince charming we must 'test' a great many frogs. So we date and put ourselves through agony and more agony. But we continue with the agony knowing that in the end we will find something, nay, someone who will make up for all the horrible things we went through to find them.  Deep inside I know this must be true because if it wasn't why would I continue to live. There must be something at the end of all the torture and sorrow, that will make it all worthwhile. though at this point what thing could possibly make up for it, eludes me. Could it be that I do not have something waiting for me? No, there must be something there.  You see now a smile comes upon my brain and I know I have nothing to fret over because thus far my journey has not been bad at all. Especially if I look at others I know. In comparison, and even withoutmy life has not been bad, except in very minor ways and I really have no place commplaiing or wanting pity. But I guess that it is human nature to want pity for I do, and so does everyone I know. Just  a little caring and compassion to let me know I'm loved and remind me that things could be worse and I could have horrors in my life that I don't.  It seems that lately I give a great deal of sympathy and get none in return. For it also seems that those who ask for and receive sympathy yearn for it even more. And to get it they will manage to turn every situation into one that they receive sympathy. And the one time you really need sympathy it will seem that no one is there for you because they will turn the situation to themselves and soon you will be busy with compassion, again, having gotten none yourself.  Then I assume you will feel slightly rejected and then find yourself in want of more pity. Until soon you have a cycle, a rut, that you can't get out of and I asuume that leads to the final resort. That last call fot help; depression.  And now that I have taken up precious minutes of your life and mine with my pondering I leave you.
