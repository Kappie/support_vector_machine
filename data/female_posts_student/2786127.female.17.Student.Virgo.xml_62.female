Its kind of like getting a piece of myself back. Thats the only way i know how to explain it really.   That just brightened my whole day.  This weekend has been pretty good, played my last volleyball game(well, real volleyball game) for the next three months. Damn i'm going to miss it. The good thing is though that wakeboarding will soon replace that empty space...weeeee!! I'm so excited for it, you have no IDEA!!  woo.  Today is now all about "spring cleaning". Ugh. But if I clean my room and my side of the bathroom i get 200 bucks...so i'm thinking its worth my while.   Nate emailed me after not talking to him for two weeks. He says hes seeing a phsychologist now...so thats good. He needs to work out some issues. He also says that he'd love to hang out with me soon. *pout* not allowed to miss nate....  anyways, god summer needs to be here. LIndsay and I were talking about it this morning, how much better its going to be with all us girls, after her and ryan break up and we can all be single (well, except kenzie) but yeah...god i need it.   I played frisbee golf yesterday with John NIck and  Ben. It was fun, I'll have to remember that for summer as well.  I need to go clean. My wallet is collecting cobwebs right now...
