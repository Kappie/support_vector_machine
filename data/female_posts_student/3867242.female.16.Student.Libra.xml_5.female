Work was boring and nothing exciting happen. After work..I headed over to MCT..to see "At This Evening's Performance"..and it was awesome! I highly recommend it..Dan did a awesome job w/ directing..as well as Stephanie and Grant acting. So go see it..the 7 dollars is worth it! After the play I went home w/ Mike..and his dad drove. By time we reached East Mead..a stupid deer ran out to the road and hit the driver's side of the van. Nobody is hurt..but the car took some damage..and after all that the stupid deer ran away. I feel really shaky right now..because about year ago..Rachael and I almost hit a dog..and well we hit a tree. That's might be the reason why I'm not in a such a hurry to get my linese..and I'm lazy..well..it's late...night.
