Someone really needs to clue the Supreme Court in on a little thing called the Constitution...because that's really the only thing on which they're supposed to be basing their decisions. Not only is the court way too liberal, but it's making decisions it has no basis deciding whatsoever. Hmm...let's just go ahead and take away all of the states' power to decide law away from them. Yeah, cuz that would be...oh wait, UNCONSTITUTIONAL! And don't give me that bullshit argument that people should be able to decide what they do in their own homes...Yeah, they decide, and I end up having to counsel their kids for 6 months. What a pain in the ass.  The good news is that the morans running for the democratic ticket, don't stand a chance of standing out against each other, much less Bush, so hopefully it's only a matter of time before we see a more conservative high court. Lieberman's the only one who has had anything constructive to say thus far and despite his campaign slogans, it's not like he's been able to beat Bush in the past.  Can someone explain to me why Dale Earnhardt needs a tribute concert? Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't he a...race car driver? Why don't they have, oh, I don't know, maybe a tribute...RACE?   But at least Chante Mallard's jury made the right decision and found her guilty. Can you say, duh?  That's my rant for the day...Only 5 teen court sessions to go--tonight was AWFUL! Pictures should be up over the weekend.  ~D~
