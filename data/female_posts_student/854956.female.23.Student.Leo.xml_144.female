I had about 4 hours of stuff to do, and I had the energy to do about 1-1/2 hours of stuff.  :-(  So... I'm finally done... Thank GOODNESS...!  But I'm incredibly nervous about my ASL presentation tomorrow.  I dunno why... but I am... I'm just always afraid that I'm going to totally botch stuff...  Okay, back on topic now... I'll attempt getting a Wacky Wednesday up tomorrow... but I make no guarantees... I also make none about next week... but I think I'll be able to get one up then... if not, there will be one the following Weds for SURE... Oh, and I think I'm getting my new car this weekend... which means... there is DEFINITELY going to be a post over the weekend... and you folks in Austin will get the chance to see it when I come for Madrigal dinner... :-)  YAY!
