Currently, I'm completely obsessed with Gloria Steinem's  Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions . The essay I read before the gym was "Words and Change," one of the most helpful essays that I have read in a long time. You guys and gals should pick this gem up if only for the giggly-good essay "If Men Could Menstruate." Next, I might read . . . ah nevermind. I'll tell you when I'm actually reading it. AND I bought the cutest (I hope) little tank top from www.feminist.org. I will post the picture if I can. I might not get it for awhile because they are temporarily out of stock. So obviously it hasn't even been shipped off yet, but perhaps I will get it by the time I leave for Cin City.   I wonder whom the feminists of our generation are? Oh, but Gloria is still pretty hip.
