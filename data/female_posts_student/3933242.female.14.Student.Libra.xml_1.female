LOts... i really want to take a rest...this is really too much for me... i cant take it anymore.. The school gives tests like no body 's business... but in the fact... it is the student's businness.. i begin to understand why many student ask for transfers.. i could sae tht i m really stressed up at this point of life... Another problem that i m facing.. is perhaps confidentual... but.. i juz pour out my feelings in here.. now... things are still steadily stable.. but i can'tpredict what will happen in future... i have to cut down all my expenses... and everything... i have to discipline myself.. and restrain myself from getting way too out of hand.. i must do it... i was really breathless in everything.. i have to slow down.. Let out one breath slowly at a time... learn toknow and live in life that i did not experience before... fortunally.. i have wonderful parents.. who think for us whenever they are.. i felt so lucky... i finally noe what does it mean by parts and puzzels of life.. i finally do...
