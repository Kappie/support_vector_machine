I've noticed that men, American men at least, that wear wife beaters on a day to day basis tend to be very particular types of men. Perhaps they are the types that can open a beer bottle with their teeth. Perhaps they are the types that want to show off their tats. Perhaps they are the types that tend to show off their bodies when they really shouldn't. They are obviously too sexy for their shirts, in their minds, so day after day they put on that uniform of theirs. Rain, sleet, hail, snow; it doesn't matter. Wife beater it is and wife beater it shall be.  There's this dude in my social psychology class who wears a wife beater  every day . He doesn't miss a beat. Everyday. He must have one of those Ronald McDonald style closets, where everything is the same but there's about twenty wife beaters to choose from.  The world is the wife beater wearers oyster and they can wear all the wife beaters they want until their heart's content. They just look lame, is all.
