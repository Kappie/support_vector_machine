The Elizabethan language is flirtatious, joyous, filled with risqué double entendre and political gossip. Elizabethans loved their language and their words were well chosen. Have fun with it. When in doubt make up a word by adding " 'st" to a conventional word such as "fill'st my cup".  "Hello", best said as "Good Day!", "Good morrow!", "Well met" "Good Bye" spoken as "Fare thee well!", "God save thee", "I shall see thee anon". "Yes" be "Aye"  "No" be "Nay"  "You" are certainly "Thou" "You would" or "You should" rolls best off the pecking tongue as "Thou would'st" or "Thou should'st". "Listen"takes power as "Hark" or "Hark now"  "Ignore that" best be whispered as "Shun that"  "Come here" moves more feet as "Come hither"  "A Salesperson" barks louder as a "Hawker" "Beer" slides down thy gullet easier as "Ale" "A Serving Woman" is a "Wench" unless you've met a "Maiden" who demonstrates a desire to serve.  "Until later" - "Anon" "Days"- "Morrow" "Evening"- "E'em"  "Never"- "Ne'r"  "Often"- "Oft"  "Why"- "Wherefore" "Maybe"- "Perchance"  "Away"- ''Aroint"  "Truly"- "Verily"  "Thank you" - "Grammercy"  EXAMPLES OF FAIRE BANTER   "He lies through his teeth!" translation "He be a prattler indeed!" "He killed himself" - "He's stuffed a red stocking" "It takes more than Sex to Make a marriage " - There's more belongs to a marriage than four bare legs in a bed" "They're having an affair" - "They've mixed sugar and sand". "What an idiot!" - "Thou dried meat's wag!" "You perfect son of a donkey's tail" - " Thou great and mighty clumperton"  THOU INSIDER TRICKS:  Hawkers revel in the good fun of barter with Competing craftsfolks. Get into the game. Should a Potter call out to you "No fine pots in all the Faire. Witness their colors rivaled only by God's rainbow". Respond with "Fie thou sneap! Note thy crack in thou fine pot". Address people by rank, title, occupation or physical description. "My Lord", "My Lady", "Good Shire", "Good Wife", "Lad" or "Lass", "Lusty Bar Maid", "Fearless Knight", "Juggler", "Silly Clown", "old Sailor", etc. Unlike contemporary society. the Elizabethan's had a socially stratified society. They were constantly aware of their social standing and the social standing of those around them. From necessity, addressing people was nearly an art form. In order to feel comfortable at Faire, you will need to have an insight to their social level and yours (the character you deem to be for the day). Fortunately, Faire people wear clothing in accordance with their social standing. The addresses used are based on a combination of social standing and familiarity. Ergo, the Earl of `Rycrofft could call the "Earl of Worth", "Worth", "My Lord cousin", etc. But a merchant or peasant would call both men "Lord", or "My Lord", or "My Lord, Earl".  "Sir" or "Mistress" be always a safe wager for a personage that is not nobility, but so well dressed as to signify upper class.  To nobility "my Lord" or "my Lady" is safe if you don't know their name or exact title. The Queen is referred to as "Your Highness", or "Your Grace''. In the third person, the Queen may be called "Her Highness. Dukes and Duchesses may also be addressed as "Your Grace".  Office holders such as Judges, Constables, or Bureaucrats, Knights and Squires may be called "Your Honour".   And there you go.  We've  got  to talk like this Monday.  Should be fun,fun!!!
