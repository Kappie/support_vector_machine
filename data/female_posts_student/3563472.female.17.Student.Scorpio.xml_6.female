So I need something exciting to do.  I DID dye my hair yesturday. You see, it was a reddish color, and it was growing out. So, I thought, "My hair looks like poop; I should dye it".   So, I did. It went from a light reddish color, to a dark brown color. It excites me greatly!  Enough. I want fun... Pity me!!!!
