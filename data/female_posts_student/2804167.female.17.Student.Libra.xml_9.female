They don’t want to go, but to stay and help their friends. Force them. The driver is waiting. A hundred bucks, he says, if they puke in my car. Each. Shit.  Send the clean ones, get them clear. They’ll go to safety, come back for the rest. What will we do with the rest? Send the ones you can. Load them in, as many as you can. Slap the roof: go. They’ll come back for more. It’s the middle of the night - we can’t find one of the girls. The other two went with the EMT. They’re poisoned. We can’t find the other - we don’t care about anything else, just her. She might die, do you understand? She might get raped, or poisoned. We have to find her now. Call everyone who knows anything. We have to find her.  Were you there? Did you see where the girl went? She might die. Come with us in our wailing car, you’ve seen more, you’re not intoxicated. Come with us, we have to find her. You’re the only one who knows enough.  She’s here. There’s a mass of them; they’re out on the floor, and the couch. One answers the door; he can’t see, can’t think, can barely stand. She’s ok. Poisoned, but safe. We found her, thanks to you who knows. Now we care about the rest. See my gun? Don’t make it aim at you.  It’s over.
