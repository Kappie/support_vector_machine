Algebra was math like, physics was boring as normal, and the vocab test in AP Lit and Comp could have been more studied but oh well I can't go back in time.  I had to eat lunch by myself b/c Eaner was missing in action today. *tear*  Mr. Powers made me run the paper.  I hate doing that by myself b/c sometimes you have to battle with the copier but I was happy b/c no such thing happened today.  Towards the end of study I talked to Jason about Chemistry.  It was so cute he was so concerned that I understood it b/c this morning I didn't.  Renae he's a keeper.  Much better than that Tysdal kid you have your heart set on!  Then I breathed a sigh of relief when Mrs. Nelson said our test in Chemistry was tomorrow b/c all along I thought it was today and I was worried b/c I didn't understand it.  Hooray for that.  Then in AP History, I had to take my test from last friday, which was extremely hard and i know I failed it b/c I saw a bunch of check marks.  Maybe I could have studied more for that one too.  But Syndiu (sp?) and I had to go to the library b/c we started a new project so we went to do research but as fate would have it we had to use the computer lab and who would I be ever so near to?  Yes, that's right Lizzie, the Boy that can melt icebergs.  WOW!!  Moving on, in Newspaper I typed.  I won't get into what happened or my feelings about certain ppl b/c then I'll sound really bitchy and I'm trying real hard to stay away from that.  But I do have one comment to make.  In chemistry John Stanley said, " Geez, there sure are alot of bitchy girls on the newspaper."  After reading Liz's column.  I could have turned around and slapped that boy! grr  On a lighter note: sweet dreams all!
