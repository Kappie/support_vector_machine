I have both. Tomorrow is my last day of high school and then it's off into the semi real world which is also known as college. But I've been told college isn't reality it's after college that you have to worry about. I guess. I'm excited about a lot of things as dorky as that sounds being able to vote, being out on my own all that goos stuff, being able to make my own decisions. Believe me  I think I'm anything but grown and far from it still I know some things but so do other people I still have a whole lot of learning to do which is cool. I have wonderful people in my life to guide me so it's all good. I don't think I'll cry tomorrow I'm tired of all the drama that goes on in high school it's absolutely ridiculous not that I  imagine college to be too much different. Me and my friend adam were talking the other day and he said he loved college and that the only difference in college is that the most of the idiots are filtered but there are some idiots that slip through the cracks that's ok I guess. I'm just ready to close this chapter in my life, that's sounds so corny but that's really how I feel. Well I'm going to go for now............. until then
