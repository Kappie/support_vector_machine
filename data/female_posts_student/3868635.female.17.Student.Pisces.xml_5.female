I've found myself with a lack of outlet for my creativity, thoughts and just my overall me-ness. I am not so much accepted as who I am, not that I truly know who that is. I am starting to get a much clearer view, but it's still not set. I don't even know what to think anymore? It's strange, why have I not been invited anywhere lately? Perhaps it is due to the events on Canada Day...not that I really know what those said events were. Or perhaps it's that I'm so openly eager to escape-leave this place behind. My life is finally beginning to begin though. I had never really expected to be moving out at 17. The thought of leaving my family, friends, and comfort zone in this suburbia behind-all for a big city, bursting with culture and who knows what else. One thing for sure is that it will not be the small town of 35,000 where I'll be attending a school of 600, 150 in my grade that I have known since kindergarten. Instead I'll be attending a college along with 6,000 other strangers.    This being said, I'm not upset that I'm leaving. As a matter of fact, as I mentioned it's the complete opposite. I truly am eager; anxious. I love my family and friends to death-most of the time. When things are good, they're great...unfortunatly, there's the flipside to be taken into account. When things get rough, it's unbearable. Pettiness always seeps through into the relationships like an overbearing gas, suffocating us all. We go about blindly, not analyzing consequences.   Honestly, as terrible as it is, I just wish that I had a relationship-one that could be BOTH physical and emotional. Why does it always seem to be one or the other? To be fair though, this is largely my fault. Why do I always target guys that I could see possibly taking interest in me and try to be myself-well the part of myself that I find to be socially acceptable, pull them in, and then lose interest. Twice this year I have done this, and both times were terrible. Both saw me at my very worst moments, and still stuck around until I just ignored them for long enough. Why am I always so terrible like that. One helped me see through a messy "breakup" of sorts, and the other through a miserable, sickening bus ride. Even after my attempts to show how I was too busy for a relationship afterwards, they stuck around. I always just dismiss the genuine guys. And here I am, sitting at my computer at 10:54 on a warm, summer Wednesday evening, lusting after this guy. This guy that I know, but don't really know. We've talked, hung out-always using school as an excuse, but he's never really shown any particular interest in me. Afterall, he does like someone else. Oh well, Prom was enough for me...or so I thought. It just really left me wanting more. Although, truthfully it has given me a little strength to not fall back into the oh so familiar rut that plagued 2 1/2 years of my life. That is most definitely NOT somewhere that I'd like to end up at again. So here I am, talking for the most part about my messy "love" history. Really, I suppose I should really re-evaluate when I say that I have no experience in this field. But how can I now deferenciate facts from fiction...what really happened, and what memories are fabricated? I suppose that this whole blog will just become one jumbled fiction and non-fiction, distorted photograph of my life.  Photography. Why can I not keep it up? I really wish that I had pursued it...it's the one thing that I have been most passionate about in my entire life. I suppose film follows down that trail, but its not black and white stills. If only I could afford to keep it up, but truthfully at this point, I am just hoping that I can afford to feed myself from month to month.  And at this rate, that will be an expensive task. Why is it that food is beginning to control my life. To ease my concerns, I tell myself that it doesn't look like I'm gaining weight, and if I drink more water, it will just flush out the excess fat. It's not. I'm just now drinking water compulsively. When I don't have a glass in my hand, my mouth goes dry and I start to think about all of the dirty, jiggle fat sticking to my insides and I can't focus on anything but getting another big glass to flush it all out. Why can't water just flush all of the bad out?! Why is it not working? How long will it take until I can commit myself to a regime that works? At this rate, I am stuck in this perpetual spiral of hopelessness.   Well, I must go and refill my glass of water, as I'm beginning to become uncertain once again whether it's half empty or half full-lusting after that which I'll never have...   Adieu.
