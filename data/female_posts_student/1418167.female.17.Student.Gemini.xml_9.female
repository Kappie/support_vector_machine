Congrats to all those on their wonderful scores, but I think Jmac takes the cake.  Read:     bloodygurthang: i got my AP grades today  hezzah875: yay! did you do well?  bloodygurthang: save one  bloodygurthang: on comp. govt.  bloodygurthang: lambuth doesnt give credit for it  bloodygurthang: soon one of the essays      bloodygurthang: i wrote, "AP THIS!!!" and drew something slightly resembling a middle finger... bloodygurthang: and got a 1  bloodygurthang: oh well  hezzah875: LMAO  hezzah875:  GENIUS     I really wish I had done that on one of my exams. Maybe I would have done better. Sadly I did  not  do as well as I had hoped, which turned out to be a bittersweet thing. While I feel like a  complete idiot , I did say that whichever exam I did better on, I would pursue that subject from now on. I did better on music theory. Perhaps this is the stars telling me something.  *Heavenly music*      I hate standardized tests . However, I do love my friends. Sallis, I owe you like eight batches of cookies now.    I leave for Florida on Wednesday morning! Yep, 6 AM, I will be on my way to Mobile, Alabama to see the USS Alabama, and then down to Pensacola to stay amongst the navy boys.  Me-ow.  Randi has taken full opportunity to remind me of the poem :).    Did you know we can   post in color   now? Ah, the indecision.    Winding down a country road  The sky a yellow red  I ride along on a light blue bike  To secretdreams that lie ahead    The strains and sounds run through my ears  In whispers small as string  The soundsjust takemy will, mydrive  Tears no longer let me sing    Ebonydogs chase me along  Hauntingvisions of before  I pedal on, I will forget  These dogswillchase meno more    I stare into the golden sun  Where fond memories are revealed  It teasesstill withhopeful promise  Thevisions beg to be real    The sky is turning orange now  The clouds are blue-gray hues  Know whenthetearshave disappeared  I'll pedal on to you.    I'm trying to work on images, thanks to the DOY kids.  Help.
