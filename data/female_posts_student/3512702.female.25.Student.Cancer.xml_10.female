I spoke with my mother today and she heard me out with a lot of personal things, and told me I need to get myself together that way I'm ok when the shoe falls. This I all know, I need a lot of change in me first. Yet as my own person I feel like such an idiot because I feel so stuck in this situation. My husband is very manipulative..Very child-like..In the sense that he would go great lengths to act stupid just to see my reaction. He doesn't listen well..Back in school I was told by a friend/teacher that he had ADD and I blew it off...Figured whets to deal with? He translates whatever I may say, hears it different and blows it outta proportion and runs with it. Its disgusting..I could say (for example if he was too close to my face..) id say, "give me some space" and he translates that to..Oh you don't love me..Oh nope no.. You want me away from you..Then he'll sit and act kiddish and mean till I so stupidly give in a little just to make him civil to be around. Its exhausting. Day by day adjusting to so much attitude and tension. Today I think to myself..Its gonna be a civil decent day if I have to so much as fake it..Its gonna happen..So everythings going fine and I'm making a dinner..Nothing big but time consuming..And its ready and he walks in, looks around and says "I gotta figure out what I'm gonna have.." Naturally I am upset and say no, dinners ready right now..Please don't act like that..  For now I have to go ..I have yet to finish up..
