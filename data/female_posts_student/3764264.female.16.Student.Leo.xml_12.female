(don't ask) And I'm really scared of being  looked  at so when the person asked, I told her I wanted it two inches above the knee. Which, by the way, isn't very mini.   So I told someone this, just a few minutes ago. He then said, "aww, it's not the seski kind?" (apparently, seski means sexy) Now, this is someone I have no sexual attraction to what-so-ever. But when he said this, all I could think about was... Someone thinking I was sexy. *smiles*  Erich has told me this a few times... That I'm sexy. *smiles* And I'm not sure what his definition actually means, but I know I can turn him on. *shivers in delight* And THAT is a major turn on.   *giggles* Its one thing to feel sexy... It's quite another to actually be sexy. And to turn someone on. It makes me feel all giggly and (dare I say it) kinda school-girlish.  Which I suppose turns back into miniskirts.   And then that turns into me wanting Erich to see me in a miniskirt. A *real* one, that you have to keep crossing your legs and adjusting yourself, to keep your panties from showing. *smiles* Not that I'd try too hard.   Lets think about that for a minute... of his hand running up my leg...Resting on my inner thigh.... close...so so close. his thumb moving back and forth from my bare skin onto my panties...flicking.... and rubbing...  Or even better. me sitting across his lap with my special miniskirt, rubbing myself on the rough denim and feeling his... exitement grow, making it push and  press  on my pussy.   Holy fuck... I am so horny right now... and hot. as in heat. Heat!!... my stomach, and back are just aching to be touched... *smiles* They're so warm.... and my hands are so cold...  Not to mention certain swollen parts...  I love you Erich, And I wish you could touch me so bad... Sage
