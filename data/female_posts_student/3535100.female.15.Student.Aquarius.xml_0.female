He was spose to call me when he got home i didnt care wut time it was...((tear tear)) didnt happen. Friday i tried to get ahold of him all day, and his lil sis taylor told me he wasnt home and that she would have him call me. well he would not answer his cell so finally around 7:30 i gave up on calling him. mom dad lyndsey n missy went to the race track and i stayed home alone till like midnight. i woke up this morning and called tims house at like 12:30...got to talk to Theresa! ((*his mommy*)) she said that we (my family) could go to the park with them and eat KFC if we wanted...i wanna go but it would be a little weird without tim there so idk yet. the rents r going to quaker steak and lube sometime soon theyre on their way home. still havnt talked to tim, but i mean someone knows something and juss isnt telling me. its kinda upsetting. but yeah idk wut im doign tonight so call my cell if you wanna chill or sumthin. but for now im gone i need to go eat, or go on a walk idk ill write tomorrow!  --Tim I LOVE YOU--   ********SyDnEy ...
