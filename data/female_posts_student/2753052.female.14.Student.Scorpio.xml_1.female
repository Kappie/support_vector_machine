And sometimes I wonder, "Y'know...maybe it's just the little depression stage all teenagers get...It's not my fault I'm so fucked up..." But what if it is my fault? I think I drive people away so I can be alone. I don't mean to. I don't WANT to; who likes to be alone? I don't know...It is so hard to live when you feel completely isolated. I can't think of anyone I know that feels like this...Maybe I do and they just didn't care enough to say anything. Right now, I think the only thing that keeps me from "giving in" would be Adi. It sounds weird, I know. My life depending on someone who lives hundreds of miles away. But I think, no, I know, she's the only person I told everything. My bestest friend, and I promised her that we'd meet up and get drunk together, have a hella fun time. I don't want to break my promise, but if shit doesn't improve, what can I do?" Yeah, there's more after that, but this is the part about ME, damnit. Now that my bout of selfishness is over...I must say... .....I love you too Lindzeh. I am so looking forward to holding eachother's hair up whilst we barf up everything we've eaten from the past decade. Or something like that.
