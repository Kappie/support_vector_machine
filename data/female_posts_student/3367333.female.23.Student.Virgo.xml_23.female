(okay, i know; i really need to flesh out what i just outlined, because as it stands it sounds like i'm pasting together stuff from a dozen books...i'll figure that out.  the good news is, none of the criticism echoes my thoughts, so i might be okay.) i also made some fabulous finds at a book store that's going out of business...among them are Kristeva's Revolution in Poetic Language, Edward Said's Beginnings, a biography of Anne Sexton, and Miriam Toews' Swing Low: A Life (which, by the way, is one of the most interesting takes on auto/biography i've ever read, and a truly touching book besides...aren't i just a little aliterative today?) and some great time wasters (i'm on a harry potter kick since the third movie, which i've seen three times, came out):  urlLink muggle net  is a great unofficial fan site, and  urlLink j.k. rowling 's official site is also fun, and amazingly designed.  i'd love to learn how to do things like that with a computer.
