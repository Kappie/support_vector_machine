I swear if I hear of one more friggin social event that I would like to be at but can't for whatever reason, I'm gonna cut off someone's fuggin head. And the worst part? THE APOLOGIES. Oh. My. Gods. If I hear one more flipping apology over something small and insignificant, my rusty spork will be very bloody at the end of the day. I mean seriously, I don't mind not getting my fortune cookie. I don't need a big long explanation filled with excuses galore (and TERRIBLE spelling accompanied with annoying shorthand). All I needed was "We're sorry, we forgot about the fortune cookie, we'll find a way to make it up to you." That's all! Don't blame the "crappy" restaurant, don't blame the fact that you were in a hurry, don't blame the fact that you spilled some of your food. Honestly,  I don't really care .    I remember reading advice about breakups. "Keep it short, simple, and to the point. Don't dwell, or you'll only invoke unnecessary emotional pains." I'd give the same advice about apologies, especially over little things. It was just a fortune cookie for crying out loud! I could have walked to the China Wok up the street and got one for a dime if I wanted it so bad! Jeezus!    I wonder when people will begin to learn from past experiences. I also wonder when Dave will start listening to me. Because he STILL has yet to show me that he does. I know it may seem mean of me, but it's times like these that I'm glad I'm not with Dave anymore.    Current Mood:  Annoyed
