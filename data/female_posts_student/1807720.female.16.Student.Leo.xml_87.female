The moring was really good and well in Math we just watched a movie and during social we got to watch the play done by the drama 30's.  I hope next Semester that the 20's get to do a play cause I would really love to do that, but I can always wait until 30.  Then we had Chem and like she told us to do a lab, Paige and I were like the only people that actually did it.  And well I only got a 30/43 on that Chapter 9 test.  The moring was going so good until Chem.  I love Chem though, I really really like it but I just keep trying and trying and I seem to be no good at it.  Our teacher always praises the people who score like really high marks on the test, especially Ashley and now Stephan.  It makes me feel kind of bad and it really bothers me because it feels like the only thing that matters to her is high marks and if your smart or not.  You know I feel like I have worked just as hard if not harder than any of those people, but no one comes up to me and says "good job Vanessa."  I wish the Chem teacher could understand for once, I don't think she ever experienced "not doing good when she put in a lot of effort" cause she does seem really smart.  But I wish she could understand and just know what it feels like sometimes for things to be very hard and not come easy.  Anyways getting off the topic of Chem cause it's starting to upset me now.  After that we had CALM and like she didn't even care if we left of stayed so I stayed for half the class.   Then I just left afterward and well got a ride in Sarah's car and we went to A for lunch and then we went to chapters for a while.  Then we got in line for Lord of the Rings cause we had pre-bought our tickets.  That movie was so good!  I hated the first two movies for it though, but I liked this one because it had alot of personal discovery and reflection within each character, but they had like five different endings for it but it was really good.  Then we drove to Boston Pizza and got dinner and exchanged our secret santa gifts with everyone.  Then I went back to my house and got Mat's gift and then went to his house.  We exchanged gifts and he got me like these different scents for your body from the body shop and a whole bunch of Vanilla stuff cause that is my favourite smell.  Then we went outside and went sliding down this hill that was like pure ice.  Lets just say I have LOTS of bruises today and my ribs kind of hurt cause I like got banged into the ice.  I am sure I probably killed a couple brain cells to cause of all the times I banged my head.  Then well Mat's asked me if I wanted to go out, but it was kind of awkward.  To be honest I don't really want to go out with him, but I just told him I wasn't sure.  I don't like to upset people or hurt their feelings.  And Chelsey keeps telling me that I should just trying and experience a relationship but honestly I don't see Mat' in that kind of way.  He is more of a friend and nothing more, that is how I really do want it to be.  Like at the dance we touched each other alot, but after a while he would not stop and then like he woulnd't let me do what I want to do.  He is a control freak.  He probably gets that from Cadets, and that is anothing thing that like he's obsessed with planes and flying and stuff.  It is one thing to be interested in something, but it's dufferent when your obsessed.  Also, I always thought to myself that looks don't matter, but now I realize that no matter how much I say that, they really do right now.  That is why at the dance I could not kiss him.  I didn't want to kiss him.  I don't want my first kiss to be with him, I KNOW that and I AM sure of it.  I just don't know what to tell him but I know sometime I will have to tell him that I don't want to go out.  Then everyone is going to be on my case and telling me to do something different, but whatever.  This time I am not listening to anyone else, not Chels, not anyone around.  I am going to do what I want to do.  And that is the way it is going to be.
