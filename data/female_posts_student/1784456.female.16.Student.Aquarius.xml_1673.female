That way the loved up couples can be loved up and go to your party, I can't but, hey I might be with some fit guys!!!  Letty and I learnt a new word last, night, its rather rude but very funny, and I cant even remember how its spellt, but no doubt it will come up in a media studies lesson.  My mother and Father are out for lunch at some of our neighbours houses with the rest of the neighbours, which means I could either stay at home and be a little bored and look after my sister or I could go and die of bordem, I went for the first option. Glad you had fun yesterday Laura, i am ill and am not venturing out of the house to much. I agree with you Kes about the whole New years resolution spice grils thing, at least I do up until the next time we all get together and party a bit to hard, or not as the case may be.  xx
