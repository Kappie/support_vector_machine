[that might've also been the year my younger brother would only venture outside with the protection of his "butterfly hat", which somehow kept him safe from flying insects by being wildly colored.]  i wish i could remember the songs but the only songs i remember from grade school are: my old kentucky home,  urlLink  muppet babies poopoo sha wa wa , and a bunch of patriotic songs.    i also remember hating/fearing those damn cicadas.  17 years later, when those cicadas are supposed to be popping out of the ground, i'm in a different part of the country waiting.   some news article told me that those cicadas of my 2nd grade year were going to visit my new residence.    and i've been waiting....  i've been both terrified about their return, and yet hoping to get the chance this time to crush them whilst my feet are protected by shoes.   thinking that  this  time they won't be such scary little creatures because i'll have the upper hand.  but either i was cheated out of the return of the cicadas, or the cicadas were so terrified by my presence they decided to stay underground for another 17 years.   either way, it has been a cicada disappointment.
