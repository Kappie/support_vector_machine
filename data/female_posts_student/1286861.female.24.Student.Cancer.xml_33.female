I too am desperately out of the budget range to be able to afford one. I cant stand it! I get to check my email, chat with buddies, and update this blog once a week if I am lucky. I know that itself was more than I was writing on this thing anyway�but now I have an excuse.  My new place is good. The only things I seem to be lacking at the moment: 1. A computer (citing the previous angry thought) 2. A microwave (witch without negates so many of the living by yourself eating habits) 3. A bookshelf (I cry every time I see my books still boxed up) 4. A dresser (yet for some reason I am okay with a huge pile of clothes on the floor of my walk-in closet).   Other fun obstacles I have run into� 1. My 3 CD Player/Changer no longer works. Plays the radio and tapes just fine. Unfortunately I got rid of all my tapes when I was 12. 2. The DVD Player I was given by the parents of my ex only plays the DVD occasionally. How and why it decides to play what it decides to play is beyond me. I have to play games with it, opening and closing the disc tray a couple THOUSAND times until it finally registers that there is a disc there. It won�t even play the CD�s the CD player won�t play. Funny how that works.  3. I am not paying for cable, so I have lots of time and silence to contemplate the previous two points. 4. Paying rent really sucks. 5. Living on your own and STILL having to depend on other people to transport you really sucks. 6. Carrying groceries and clean laundry upstairs really sucks.  Please do not get me wrong, I love living on my own. That list was of things I have noticed and of things I can work on, or save money for rather. The rest of the apartment experience is top notch. Learning lots of new things and having fun while I do, what more can I ask for.  Then there came  urlLink Brenden , out of all places, Nevada. Literally, the day we met he was on his way back from Nevada where he was visiting his parents and where he once lived. I constantly ask myself how the hell I got so lucky, and how I ever convinced him out of a second glance. But I plan on holding onto him for a while. There are so many things that he says or does that make me stop. That is really the best way to put it I think. He makes me stop. My mind�my heart�anyway. I like him.  Work is work�same old same old. I reach my 90-day mark on September 10th on which my medical benefits become active. Being a diabetic, this is a very very good thing. Have had some issues with people I work with, but I think we may have worked through a couple of them. Hopefully. I will keep the masses (all 2 of you) informed.  All for now kids. I am off to rinse my head. I am on yet another adventure into a different shade of red. We will see how it turns out.
