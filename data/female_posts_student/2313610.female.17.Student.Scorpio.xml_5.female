I love that little snippet so much, and, in spirit of the holiday season, I decided to put it up and piss good Christians, which I am not, off. It's my goal of the day. Have I succeeded. Or do you have a sense of humor? Neh....  I'm feeling pretty good today, beside being treated like crap form my oldest friends, but, after awhile, you cease to care, or that's what I tell myself. I'm not sure if it's true, but I'll let you all know when I find out.   We had the most  boring  AP US History class today. It wasn't the teacher, he's never  ever  boring, but we've reached a pretty dull place in history I must say. Post reconstruction era is beyond dull, though at least I know what it is. My friend thought it was the 1930's.... Yah, I have smart friends don't I? They think they have the right to make fun of my decathlon greatness, but at least I know when the reconstruction was... Sheesh!  I didn't even tell them how I did, and they didn't bother to ask. Sounds like a well balanced relationship. He did get me a muffin though, so I don't hate him. However, I really don't understand why I mean so little to them while they tell me to my face that I'm their friend. A little honesty here! Ok, ranting is bad... Go back to happy place...  Yah, I have a Spanish presentation about Francisco Franco, and all I know about him was that he was a Spanish fascist that ruled Spain for such and such time. Shit...  Ok, on that bright note, I'm going to read... See ya!
