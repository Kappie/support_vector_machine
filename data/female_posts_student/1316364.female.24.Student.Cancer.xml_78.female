Despite the many complaints from her boyfriend Mike, a landscaper, I felt it turned out wonderful and my mom was so happy with the way it turned out that I really didn’t care what Mike’s opinion was (he seems to have an opinion for everything). Then I took my shower and got ready to go to my nephew Isaac’s 5th Birthday Party. When we got to the party (my mom, her Boyfriend Mike and me) I quickly ran to the backyard of my sister’s house where the party was taking place. I quickly went in search of Isaac because I wanted to wish him a HAPPY BITHDAY!!! When I found him, much to my surprise, he was dressed in his Hulk costume, although I have to wonder why beings that it was probably 90-something degrees outside. Angela, my sister, said that he insisted on wearing it to the party because it was a hulk party. The evening was quite nice, I got to meet some of my sister’s coworkers and their kids and I could tell that the kids were having a blast, playing with water balloons and running around the yard like the little animals they are (you would very much agree if you knew my sister’s kids).  I also got to see my brother and his Girlfriend/my friend Candace. Candace greeted me with a little gift, it was a mini beanie baby bear named spangle and he was the color of the American flag. I thought it was so sweet of her to give it to me. When the party was through my mom, Mike and I took Isaac and went home, you see my gift to him was a day out with auntie and a trip to the Build-A-Bear Workshop. When I got home I was so pooped from my day I pretty much called it a day and went to sleep. The next day I woke up around 7:30 and started my day. I got up and got dressed and ate breakfast, like I always do. Isaac helped me set up my new birdcage, that I bought from a garage sale for $20.00, which was a steal and before I knew it was time for Isaac and I to head out on our way. Mike took us to the Light Rail Station on Florin Road and shortly after the train came and we hopped on. Isaac loved the ride on the train and on our way Downtown we passed the station I catch the train after school to go to work. I pointed out the school to Isaac. In no time we were in Downtown and had met up with my Friend Dale who greeted up with two cold bottles of water and a really cool Hulk watch for Isaac. We hopped on to the next train and headed towards Arden/Del Paso Heights. When we got there our bus was waiting. Isaac got on the bus and showed the Bus Driver his buss Pass, it was so cute. Then off we went to Arden Mall, where the Build-A-Bear Workshop was. When we got there we walked into the mall and to the nearest ATM, after all I needed Money to pay for his bear… and then to Spencer’s Gifts, one of Jesse and I favorite Stores then of to the Build-A-Bear, you should have seen Isaac’s face when we walked up, he was so happy to be there. After several minutes of browsing Isaac decided on a cute black bear to build. He went to the sound station and picked a sound for his bear, “happy Birthday Bear” song and then made his way to the stuffing machine and began the process. Half way through filling up his bear the machine ran out of stuffing do the girl making his bear took Isaac to the stuffing bins and he helped her fill it all up again. Then back to the machine to fill up his bear the rest of the way. He picked a heart from a bin and made a wish and put it inside the bear for safekeeping. Then she closed the bear up and off we went to the fluffing station. We fluffed the bear and then clothed him and Isaac named him King. It was so cute. After I paid for the bear Isaac got to have the store sing “Happy Birthday w/ Cha Cha Cha’s” and they rang a big bell in his honor. Then off to lunch we went. The day was so fun but by the end I could tell that Isaac was pooped and so was I. I know he had the best birthday ever though and that was exactly what I had set out to do.  The only thing I regret about this weekend is that I wasn't able to talk to Jesse. I just wish that Jesse could have been there… :-(
