The service is great, the portions are large and the prices are reasonable. Brian and I are regulars there. We don't have to look at a menu and they don't have to ask what we want to order. It's awesome!     2. What fast food restaurant are you partial to?  Japan Express. It's cheap. They give you lots of food. And it's healthier than eating burgers. (I think.)     3. What are your standards and rules for tipping?  Always tip 20% of the bill. I learned that from Oprah. My mom says I'll never get rich because of my tipping habits. LOL.     4. Do you usually order an appetizer and/or dessert?  It depends on where I am. It also depends if I'm paying or not. Ha. Ha. Ha.     5. What do you usually order to drink at a restaurant?  A virgin strawberry daiquiri.
