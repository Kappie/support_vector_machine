And most of all we can work things out! In the width span of 2 1/2 hours he and I connected like never before! It felt so wonderful and traquilizing! I am so glad we had our talk. I hope on many levels we are some what closer! Time is such a vunerable yet a inpregnable tool we all use to keep order and stability. But some times just forget about all of the clocks and watches; do what ever the hell you want! Trust me, it really heals and revitalises you.  Much lov, Brandi*
