I did spring cleaning (well, yes, technically summer cleaning, but I'm perpetually late in these matters) in my residence room today and dumped a ton of stuff I don't need.  The place is now sparkling.  After that, I went to Mass (good old D. was there again) and returned home to start my Psych reading for the third quarter of the course.   At 3pm, I went over to pick up my exam booklet.  Accessibility still hadn't delivered it so I got a blank copy and checked my answers from memory against the answers on the website.  I got 94% on the multiple choice!  Now, the short answer (at least the last one) wasn't so pretty, so I imagine I will end up with a grade in the neighbourhood of 85-87 again this time, which suits me just fine.  The Psych coordinator just wrote to say my own booklet arrived so I should go get it.    More to come...
