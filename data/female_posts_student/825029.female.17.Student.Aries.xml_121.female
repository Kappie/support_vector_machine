Mason was gone today, so that was kinda cool... got to just goof around instead of having to play my solo for him.  heh  And at least I have another night to practice before I play it for him again.  I don't know if it'll do me any good, though...  I don't really feel like going into detail about my day, because it was oh so boring... so, according to simple mathematical properties, you reading about my boring day would be just as excruciatingly boring as my day itself.  And I wouldn't wish that boredom on anybody.  I'm playing hearts right now with Charles and Habibi.  Boy, that game rocks.  I love it so much!  Anybody think they can beat me?  I'll take you on...  Hmmm not much to say today.  I've got a couple more cool song alerts -- "The Zephyr Song" by Red Hot Chili Peppers and "Idioteque" by Radiohead.  Make sure you check them out!  Anybody got a better survey than the one that I posted a couple days ago?  It was fairly entertaining to do and kept me busy for a little while, but I've seen much better ones.  Race Coppell next Saturday!  Anybody up for taking some bets??  Wait, no... on second thought, I don't have much money so maybe I shouldn't gamble the little that I have all away.  hehe  Mmkay, that's all... like I said, not much to put on here tonight.  Hope everyone is having a good week!  Adios mis amigos!
