The living room got painted on Monday and new mouldings yesterday.  I have been doing way to much but I am keeping busy.  My list is getting smaller.    I actually sat outside on my deck this afternoon, what a amazing day.  It felt great to have the sun on my face.  It seems to have magic powers..  Have a great night everyone and..............Be Good
