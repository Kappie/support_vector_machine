Sagittarius energy represents anything that takes one beyond normal boundaries.  You appreciate the great outdoors because of the wide-open spaces and freedom it brings.  The real you can be quite idealistic and philosophical about life. Accepting and understanding abstract ideas and theories is natural for you.  You seek truth and are basically very honest. Because of your willingness to "say what you see," this sign has earned a reputation for being somewhat blunt.  As far as you're concerned there's no reason to beat around the bush when you can always take the direct and truthful approach.  You would never willingly hurt someone's feelings, but try to remember that others may not be prepared to accept your well-meaning honesty. You can be quite gullible because you tend to accept things at face value. You expect the same honesty from others that you yourself express.
