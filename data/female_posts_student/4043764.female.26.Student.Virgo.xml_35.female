So I've talked to the boy to let him know that there are some things in my refrigerator that he might want to use for tomorrow's dinner. In usual boy fashion, he has not decided what he wants to cook and he also sounded like he might back out of the engagement. I am sure that I mentioned that I was hoping that this would be our opportunity to clear things up, have a bit of resolution/closure. Just to have one last private meeting before I leave. But, as I was saying earlier, I think he might flake. Here's the  urlLink poll .
