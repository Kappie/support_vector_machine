You love it. You quiver whenever you see a wooden spoon. You spend your day dreaming up naughty acts so that you can be punished come sundown. Remind me again, what's the problem with that? Sounds pretty fun to me! If some safe, sane, consensual activity gets you hot, why deny yourself?  Besides, if you enjoy a variety of sexual activities now, you'll likely enjoy them just as much post-spanking. You'll just have a great new sensation to work with. I say give it a try, with your partner’s consent. Check out the spanking tips below and remember that it takes a few practice tries for reality to live up to fantasy.   Spanking 1-2-3  Keep a spanking session light for the first time. The strokes should be gentle and teasing, with lots of caresses in between. Leaving a session wanting more is way better than leaving it feeling overwhelmed.  Try having the spankee lie across the spanker's lap (the classic position) or kneeling beside the bed with head and chest down on the bed. The ability to relax and give yourself over to the spanking is key. Spanker: it's a really nice touch to tease your partner's genitals during the event.  The spanker should use her hands instead of a paddle for the first sessions. It's more intimate, there's less danger of hitting too hard, and it's quite delicious to see a bum squirming under your bare hand. If your spanking arm is getting tired out from night after night of chastisements, it might be a good idea to look into some paddles. Be creative with household items like hairbrushes or ping pong paddles, or invest in a paddle from your local sex shop.  Jay Wiseman, in his book SM 101, advises cupping your hand and spanking upward, as opposed to a downward stroke. He also cautions that gravity can pull asscheeks down, so make sure to spank on the lower part of the buttocks on a kneeling person. You can also spank the genitals (start gently!), the breasts, and just about anywhere on the body.  Feedback is the MOST important thing when exploring a new activity. Spankee, if you don't like a sensation (or if you do), speak up and let your partner know! Spanker, make sure to ask the receiver how it’s going. Is it too hard, too slow, are they ready for another spank? As with everything in bed, your partner is going to be a lot different from the last person you laid your hands on. Lots of people, for example, want to know exactly when the next stroke is going to come. I like to be pleasantly surprised.  A final word: once you get into power games like spanking, it's time to start thinking about safewords. A safeword is a code word the person on the receiving end can use to give feedback to their partner. One popular choice is to say green when you mean "I'm ok, keep going," yellow for "slow down or switch it up, please," and red for "please stop right now. Untie me and let’s have some tea." Just remember that safewords are serious business, and should NEVER be taken lightly by the giver or the receiver. Respect the safeword!
