I’m like a broken wing angel Lost in its destiny Left behind From all his friends Dieing slowly everyday it passes Loneliness is my closest friend  I’ve been hiding from life I’m building this shelter from people So much suffer I’ve been put through That I can’t hold it any longer So many tears I’ve cried So many aches fill my heart and soul I’m loosing my faith I tried my very best to fit in I just don’t seem to find the best way of livin
