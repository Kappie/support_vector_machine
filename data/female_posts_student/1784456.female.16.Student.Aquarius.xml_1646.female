It's my subconscious figuring it out, so all of a sudden I'm wondering what it is I've figured out. It takes a few days to reach my conscious mind. More like a week. Which isn't good when you're in a test. I think my subconsious mind and conscious mind need to mix more! Hmm... wonder when someone figured that you had a subconsious mind and a conscious mind? *see! it takes a paragraph of dribble to get clever intelligence!*
