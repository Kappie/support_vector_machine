We shoped for a while, then went to lunch, and got lots of ice creak and chocolate from my favorite candy store where you can look the the window and watch them make the chocolate.  We went back to canmore for about an hour after that, and then dropped off Melissa, and went home.  That was basically my day today.  And well I need to go watch the news now - love the news.  And well I have no idea what I am doing tomorrow.  A couple more weeks to my birthday...maybe two or something like that.  I am looking forward to generous gift of money which I most desperatly need.  Since you know I like killed my debit card when I went shopping with chels I am like going to have no money for gas.
