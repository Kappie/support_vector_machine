I feel shit about Carlos, and i have no money and i feel rough and i just want Jason. How do i make it clear that i could make him so happy! JASON I LOVE YOU, I WANT TO BE WITH YOU, FOREVER, PLEASE THINK ABOUT THIS... Maybe this has sent some kind of mental message to him, i always try and be there even if i fuck up, or say something bad. And he spoke to me yesterday, and just spoke about Eliot and then Laura, and stuff. Oh, bollocks!   ~Lisa~
