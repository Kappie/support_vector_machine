Not great, but not terrible. I think band camp is going to be a killer though. I just have this feeling that by the end of it...I'll NEVER want to have anything to do with band ever again.   I think I have a knack for IM'ing people just as they go away. Really, I always seem to IM people 2 or 3 minutes after they become idle. Ah well, such is life. Hmmmm, I'm thinking Alex is mad at me for some unknown reason...but I can't think of what...
