You are Rule 8, the most laid back of all the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  While your forefather in the Federal Rules may have been a stickler for details and particularity, you have clearly rebelled by being pleasant and easy-going.  Rule 8 only requires that a plaintiff provide a short and plain statement of a claim on which a court can grant relief. While there is much to be lauded in your approach, your good nature sometimes gets you in trouble, and you often have to rely on your good friend, Rule 56, to bail you out.     urlLink Which Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    By the way, I don't think this describes me at all.  But it's still vaguely entertaining nonetheless.
