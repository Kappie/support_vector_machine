When I'm pissed I like to hear You Oughta Know.      You seem well, things look peaceful   I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know   Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity   I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner   It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced   And are you thinking of me when you fuck her      ... Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me   And I'm not gonna fade   As soon as you close your eyes and you know it   And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back   I hope you feel it...         But the man in that song isn't every man.  I also like Head Over Feet. (when I'm in a more optimistic mood)      I had no choice but to hear you   You stated your case time and again   I thought about it      You treat me like I'm a princess   I'm not used to liking that   You ask how my day was      Chorus:   You've already won me over in spite of me   And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet   Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are   I couldn't help it   It's all your fault      Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole   You're so much braver than I gave you credit for   That's not lip service      Chorus      You are the bearer of unconditional things   You held your breath and the door for me   Thanks for your patience      You're the best listener that I've ever met   You're my best friend   Best friend with benefits   What took you so long      I've never felt this healthy before   I've never wanted something rational   I'm aware now...      I especially like the line You're so much braver than I gave you credit for, and You are the bearer of unconditional things, you held your breath and the door for me...
