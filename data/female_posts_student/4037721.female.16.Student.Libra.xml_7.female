Choose a band/or artist and answer only in song TITLES by that band::  Avril Lavigne       Are you female or male::  Too Much To Ask     Describe yourself::  Complicated   How do some people feel about you::  Anything but Ordinary   How do you feel about yourself::  Unwanted   Describe your ex girlfriend/boyfriend:  Who Knows   Describe your current girlfriend/boyfriend::  My World   Descibe where you want to be:: Together   Describe what you want to be:: Nobody's Fool   Describe how you live:: (for) Tomorrow   Describe how you love::  Things I'll Never Say   Share a few words of wisdom::  Why   So there you have it, I didn't have too mant titles to work with (only 27, ha) but I tried to fit them best I could. Well they fitted better than other artists I like. See you for now...
