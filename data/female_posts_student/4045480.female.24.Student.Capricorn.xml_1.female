Put that all together and if you couldn't figure it out, yes I am a democrat. Living in IL I'm happy to see Obama could basically run away with the election because he has no opponent at current time, not to mention he seems to me to be the best man for the job, a very good speaker, a family man, and is a moderate liberal (I'm not exactly keen on the crazy psycho tree huggers that linger too far to the left).   So that all being said, I listened to Kerry's speech today. I thought it was a well played move in the battle for the presidency. He covered all his bases, and of course I liked the part about giving teachers better pay and more respect. Definitely up my alley. I think at this point Bush has his work cut out for him, and that it seems like the election is going to be another very very close race. But it is extremely early to tell, however, I'm pretty certain he'll have my vote.
