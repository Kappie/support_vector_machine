So the next time I happen into a biology class, you can cut the fish's head off, right?  Actually, Mr. K, Miss V has been called a demon before. I'm sorry, but peanut butter has nothing on chocolate. (Miss V says it's the other way around.) Really, Mr. K, there's no reason to be   that   upset. We're all friends here, right? (Ish?)  I'm not particularly fond of either, Ava, but Miss V was commenting that peanut butter is better for you physically than rum.  Excuse me, Muiya, but I believe you and Miss V are mistaken. DARK CHOCOLATE rules over all, well, maybe just CHOCOLATE in general; there's no age limit. You can get addicted from the time you can eat.  Thank you, Jack!!! Wait, you completely lost me with the reference to techno-babble. What's that?  I don't know how the peanut butter and alcohol thing started, but I bet it has something to do with Sparrow and me.  Ooh! Behold the power of demon mothers! Hah! My demon's mother is... Okay, nevermind. She says not to go there.
