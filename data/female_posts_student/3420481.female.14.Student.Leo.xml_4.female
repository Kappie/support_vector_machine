When she told me I felt like crying but I didn't. I felt so bad for them. I had to get over it though because I had a test first hour. I feel like I did a pretty good job. Then at the end of the period she was handing out the accentuate the positive slips and she gave me two for letting her use my book. Inside the book was a card and I was so afraid to open it because I thought it might have been anthrax. Was I ever wrong. While we ate our food second hour Trent opened it. She gave me a free french fry slip from McDonalds. Third hour we got to play with this awesome dot paper. We also got to draw on it and play with little fun cubes to help us with our lesson. It was such a joy. During fourth hour we talked about ways to say no to having sex. We also got to watch a really corny movie. Now that was stupid. At lunch I kept playing with Desire`'s crutches. They are so fun. We all think that she is faking it because she keeps switching which foot she was going to hop on. How stupid huh? Fifth hour I got to go downstairs and scan in pictures for Mrs. Engels. I scanned in Shana's, Katie's, and Trent's. I scanned in more too but those are the ones I remember. Trent was so cute as a baby. Well he kind of still is but I like him cuz he's funny and smart. Sixth hour we got our high school i.d. pictures taken. I think I closed my eyes. I really don't know. I saw dots the rest of the afternoon. Then I scanned more pictures for Mrs. Engels. During seventh hour we watched the rest of the Anne Frank movie. I took my social studies test I missed on Friday eighth hour. I don't think I did so good. I'm gonna study a bit more.  We had a track meet tonight. Thanks to the rest of our 4*200 team we got first place. GO LIZZIE, LIBBY, AND LINDSEY! You guys rock. In the 100 meter I got a really bad place. I'm just not really good at that race. Before all the races started I took Desire`'s crutches from her and was limping around with them. Mr. Flanagan saw me and goes... what'd you do to yourself? He saw me like five minutes ago without them. WOOOOOOOOO.. someone was lacking common sence at that point in time. I just told him I stole the crutches from Desire`. He just laughed and walked on.  After the meet we went to Wal-Mart. I had to get the femine products. You know. I also had to get shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.  When we got home my mom and I watched Colonial House together. I didn't eat dinner until eight. I wasn't really hungry anyway. I had a hot dog and chips. It was quite tasty.
