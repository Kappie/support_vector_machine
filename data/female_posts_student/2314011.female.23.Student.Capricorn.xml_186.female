       
      I'd forgotten the roller coaster ride these things bring.    I remember the newness, how heightened everything seems in the beginning, trying to find my way through old feelings resurfacing in wonderfully new ways.    I remember the steps on the way to getting to know someone, really 'knowing.'  But I'd forgotten how quickly everything can change over so small a thing.  How suddenly the day can transform into something completely different than how it began and somehow circle back again by the end.    I'm remembering now why the tides are so frequently forgotten.  If we didn't forget, we wouldn't try again.     And I'm reminded tonight that the ride, with everything it brings, is still preferable to the alternative.
