Listening to:   Radiohead's Ok Computer    Watching:   Uh, nothing...I have this fucking case comment to do...By Friday!!!      Dreams, Peeves, and Other Things   Lately, I have been having the strangest dreams, but my dreams last night and during my nap this afternoon have been the weirdest.  Last night, I dreamed that I was in this pool with Quentin Tarantino. We were underwater holding our breaths for some reason. Really, you should have seen how long we were able to hold our breaths. Quite Impressive. Then, I gingerly reach over to lightly brush my hand against his crotch. The gesture was so uncertain and tentative like someone going to put their hand on what they know is a hot stove. Then, in perfectly clear speech (bear in mind we are still underwater...really, the lung-capacity! Call the Guiness Book of World Records!), Quentin said, "No, go on! Grab it!" and I make the same tentative, unsure gesture. The next thing I know, we are in this sauna-type room with some other people. Quentin made some comment about how hot my boobs were, and I get extremely flustered, and have to leave the sauna. That was it....That was my dream!  I have read in several magazine interviews that Quentin is a bit of a manwhore. So, this had lead me to the question. If I had the chance to meet Quentin, would he sleep with me? I always seem to ask this question when I hear that a guy is a bit of a slut. It is like the official manwhore test: Would this guy sleep with me if the occassion arose?  This afternoon, I had a dream where I was on this cruise, and I kept having random encounters with this guy who I exchanged sexually-charged glances at everytime we passed each other. Then, I had this fairy godmother of sorts who tried to set us up, but in turn the guy ended up falling in love with the fairy godmother.   My conclusions about these dreams tell me that 1)I need to get laid and 2) My self-esteem is in the shitter, but really...did I need a dream to tell me this? It's common knowledge. Blah, I hate when dreams try to be all meaningful, and they aren't!
