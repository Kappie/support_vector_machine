Long story short, I was in Cedar rapids tonight, I got home, Dad had pulled in two seconds before me because him, mom, and Seth were all still at this party thing at a friends house. So I head back over with him, listen to a crappy local band (but they did play one Greenday song), and watched my parents and older brother get drunk. K, it was really just the bro, poor dear. He kept getting all huggy and putting his arm around me and what not, very funny. Anywho, so we decide to walk home, Dad and Mum will come in a bit, so here are a few little tidbits from our conversation when we got home. Z boy was tipsy, and it was a riot. Believe me, this is NOTHING! He was talking so fast this is probably a hundredth of the hilarious stuff that came out of my brothers mouth, I could only write so fast. I think I need to invest in a tape recorder.     Seth: Dubuqe, Davenport, Johnson County, New York City, Iraq.    Camille: Oh nice, seven beers and a push up.    Seth: Dinosaurs are scary.    Camille: Ah huh.    Seth: Well they are! They had big toes, like nails…they did! They were scary…and…they killed that boy in Jurassic Park…  Aw, wheres Meghan? Shes not on the couch anymore. She was here…but now shes gone.    Camille: Okay now THAT I’m not putting online.    Seth: No you got to put that on there because I’m drunk and its funny and she’s cute.  I put my shirt back on, see its all buttoned up and I miss Meghan. Man it sucks, she went back to her stupid Oregon, and that sucky Portland. Man everyone should live in Iowa. Did I do that to that horse? Because if I did it I want to undo it because it looks like crap. That’s good, that’s good, that’s good pie. Seriously don’t tell Mom that I was in here with you guys eating pie while I was drunk, she’ll kill me. Seriously, because she’ll think I am influencing you guys in like a bad way. Did I say something about Grandma Maude? So do you like the part where Satan kills God? But it’s okay because God comes back at the end and kicks his butt. Hey! No, you put HER when you should of put HERE! No! That’s wrong! You made it wrong!    Camille: Gosh I’m going to fix it shut up!    Seth: Then there was the time when I met the sleeping monkey in my closet, and I taught him the lesson about how to respect himself. All he had to do was make the face and I taught him how to become a flying dolphin. Now that’s some serious stuff, like the Holocaust. Man that was some serious stuff, people were dying and everything. Man I’m drinking root beer and its diet and good for me because its LOW CARB!    Camille: You read slow.    Seth: What are you looking at? You guys suck I’m going downstairs…man you guys are such losers…I’m going. Okay I can’t open this door…okay I’m going downstairs, and oh man it’s dark and I’m scared! I’ve got ‘Wheat Thins’!!!!    So yes, I really want to write about my trip and so much other stuff, but nows not the time.
