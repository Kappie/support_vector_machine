LOL, you will, someday, you are just too innocent to even want to get it. I like that! so anyway, I still have a big secret that I would like to talk to you about...so if you read this, maybe you can come online and talk to me! I would like that very much, in fact, right now I am praying that you do, because I am bored out of my mind at home and not tired. * yawn * no, really I'm not...Oh, and don't worry, the secret isn't ummmm, wierd, well it sorta is, but it's kinda funny, I hope. ok, well enough said here, just talk to me! ~Kendra
