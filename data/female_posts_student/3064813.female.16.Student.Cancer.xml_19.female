I just spent the last ten minutes (exaggeration) trying to log onto this STUPID COMPUTER and then spent another fifteen million years trying to access the internet.  Anyways, moving on to world news.... Guess what?  Computer God hates me, and really has a deathwish for me.  I'm not even kidding, either.  My internet connection is FINE but iMesh and Kazaa won't connect and ALL OF MY MUSIC THAT WAS IN iMESH WAS DELETED.  I had my starlight mint stuff back!  I had 24 songs by of montreal!  I had a bunch of Reel Big Fish and REALLY what else does anyone need in life??  NOTHING!  Then my sister went and did some stupid shithead thing and decided that she needed to download fifty billion weezer songs and then it all died.  It was sooooo sad!!!  Uh oh, librarian at... there.  okaaaayyy leaving now!
