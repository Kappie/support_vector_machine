I dont want to explain again, because I have so many times tonight not only to other people but to myself. I wrote this..   I cant have a feeling without being wrong my feelings mean shit and you tell me Im weak but when Im with you my head is strong I dont studder or stop for air when i speak give me one more lesson before you turn away Im finding it so hard for me not to cry I guess its okay if you leave me today I wont ever ask myself how and or why When will I see what ever it is that you teach I just push it away when it is negetive everything you say is one good long speach about how hard it is for you to live You give me my strength that I'll admit but I have to feel on my own when i can None of my problems mean shit and I'm left holding my own fucking hand.   Anyway..just like..basically I am extremely weak, and WIlliam thinks that I cant make decisions on my own..but I think it's really driving my crazy. How am I ever supposed to be myself if I cant make decisions. I dont want to anymore..I'm pretty much sick of talking. I always say I'll stop but I never do..I'm scared of holding shit inside..because I did my whole life. I pretty much changed and bill told me that I need to be able to speak my mind..but now when I do it's not "my mind" and I just say shit..and like, I dont know..shit is SOOO fucked up. I love Bill so much, but I'm having doubts. I'll never be good enough..when I say this bill thinks that I do it to make him feel bad but I really really dont. I have to go..I cant take this anymore..AHHH
