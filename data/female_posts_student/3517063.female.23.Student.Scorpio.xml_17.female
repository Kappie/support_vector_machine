They review each resume and approve them or deny them for publishing, suggesting certain changes.  Mine apparently had only a few incorrigible flaws, like daring to use italics and underlines. However, they did decide to comment on the content, suggesting that I perhaps had too much science and that this would make it difficult for me to find a position in international affairs. I suppose they want me to remove most of my science experience from my resume. Well, forget about it. I'm not removing five years of my life off my resume just because some snot-nosed career advisor thinks I should.
