When Benedict pretended that he did not see Pei Ling, I thought he was joking, but it was true... That time, I could see that Pei Ling was very sad... I felt sad for her too... The day before the oral, she was having a fever, I think partly because of everything she had faced... Everything was so bad for her that time... But now I am really glad that everything is over now!!   Xueling
