Well anyways I'm back from Europe. It was koo... but then kinda boring... but then koo. Jups. Garsh I dunno what to say! Ha! Um... let's see today I kicked it with Nana, Miriam, and Yesenia. Ha! Well, Nana and I are kinda mad at Miriam right now. Well, Nana's mad at Miriam cuz you can kinda say that Miriam is being a "5th Wheel" and well she has been. Then I'm kinda mad at Miriam cuz she's been lying about a lotta things and yeah... But oh well. LOL It was funny cuz Nana and I went to go pick up Yesenia from Berendo and she had detention so we were waiting and she passed through the front and we didn't see her! So we were like OMG! Well Nana and I just went to her house and we all kicked it. It was bad! ^_^ HaHa and we were all clowning around and cracking up at some good times we had in Middle School. Too bad Yesenia is in 8th grade but ha! We're still good friends. HaHa it was funny when some guy called Yesenia and Nana and I started clowing and I was like "Ooh it's Tony"... "Ooh it's Jesse" then Nana says "Ooh it's Miguel" and I'm like "Ooh it's Jesus Christ!" LOL and we were all ROFL and I'm like "Looks like Jesus Christ gave Blondie a booty call!" HaHa it was HILARIOUS! Then Nana was clowning on how Tony skanks and she was trying to do it and she does it FUNNY! Ha! Well anyways... I guess that's about it. Nothing more. Bored like crazy... Well I dunno. I'll come by when something fun actually comes up. Oh and not to mention I'm going to the Chencha Berrinches show this Thursday! Can't wait!!! ^_^
