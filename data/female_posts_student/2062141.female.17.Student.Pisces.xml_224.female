On Friday, me, Josh and my aunt Robin went to the mall, i wish I had any money at all, then I went to hang out with Ryan at a partay, fun stuff but I WISH i was told to bring my BATHING SUIT >:| jk it's k, then yesterday it was Erinn's b-day party, which of course was horribly divided into little cliques yeah. I was about to go home around 1am but ga for some reason I stayed, but I left as soon as I woke up this morning around 9. I have homework to do that I don't wanna do, but I really should, and I should study because well it's finals week and that sucks. But you know what ELSE it is??? THE LAST WEEK OF SCHOOL yah baby!  God I'm so bored I hate Sundays cause Sundays are always like, well, I can't stay up late and I have school tomorrow and it's a whole week and I procrastinated on my homework and it's not sunny and it's not rainy and it's too bright and it's dark in my house and i just wanna go to sleep until Friday.  I hope Friday will be fun... I hope it's sunny so it'd be nice to go out on Caitlin's boat. She says we can go tubing but we'll see how that goes... I did get a new bathing suit though, but yeah,  the lake is freakin' freezing Mr. Bigglesworth. K i'm just babbling on and on so I'm gone.
