Nathan wants to ask me out tomorrow.   what do i do??!?!?!!  i have my reasons for not wanting to, but none are coming to mind when i try and think about it. but i know they're in there. i know they are! jeez...  and i feel so bad, b/c he deserves an explanation, but i can't give him one, and it makes me feel horrible!   *sniffle* *sad/angry/confused little pony*  i don't know what to say, but i do want to go out wiht him, but then again i don't. i don't know what's holding me back, but obviously something......
