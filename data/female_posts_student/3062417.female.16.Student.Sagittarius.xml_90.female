I think I failed a chem test today. It was really hard.  I've been writing down my thoughts through out the day for some reason lately. Here are some from today: "You may be able to defeat me, but you can never destroy me." That was my version of the quote we had in English today. Just think about it. And then theres, "I can handle anything you throw down, so give me all you've got."  So, tonight I have jazz band. Fun. But until then I've got nothing to do so I'll probably just be right here. Right now I'm listening to older stuff from The Early November and talking to Gavin.  By the way, there is a new thing on here where you can post comments (at the end of the post). Feel free to do that. And say anything, nothing will bother me.
