The fleamarket (From this point on i will call 'the forsaken') is swarming with people who don't have enough money to shop in real stores. (Sadly, we're on the verge of becoming one of those people) There was some guy who went by singing "I am one of God's servants, as are we all" to a tune i have NEVER heard in my life. Marquis is taking over my life. I've had to write the newsletter, set up displays, make posters, drum, drum some more, train recruits, drum some more, march, drum some more, switch drums, drum some more...you get the picture. Other than Marquis, i've just had work. There's a dog named Sonny, a little 'weiner' dog, who screams like a friggin banshee every time you walk by him. Stupid little mutt. Definitely should have been castrated. He's bad enough without having THAT thing looking at you.

I'd much rather be in school with my friends, although i will deny ever saying that in a court of law. Oh, and just to clear one thing up, that guy, "he had it comin'". Love ya, April
