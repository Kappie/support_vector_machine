Iwas half an hour late for work.It was okay though because I didn't care. (Remember, I hatemy job.)  That same friend just told me something very interesting today. She told me that she met, made out with, has the home and cellphone number of the lead singer from Fuel,he also bought her a diamond cross pendant.Now, for a moment I actually thought to say, wow, I'm so jealous of you. But then, I realized that was a lie. I was in no way, shape or form jealous of her. I thought it was really cool that ithappened to her. (Am I truly that gullible?...) But there was no envy. Just amusement. I like amusement, it's funna. I just found that whole situation interesting and had to share it.  Good things:  I found out the source of my bites. Some creature is living in my bed. It could be a flea or a tick, tic, whatever, or a lice or a crab.Hopefully it's neither. I'd rather it be Tammy.But something bit me last night and it was actually painful. I thought maybe it was skin cancer. So, yay.   My car is in the process of getting fixed. JD Byrider isn't that bad of a place. They are letting me make payments. I owe Kevin a chocolate chip cookie. I may spit in it. Cause I don't appreciate being lied to, but he did put in a little effort to get the payment plan approved. So, yay.   Nikol, tell Ned that I will give him a cookie too if he sits with the kids while we go out and get piss drunk. But I won't spit in it... cause he's a nice guy...Notice how I put this under the list of good things...please don't disappoint me on my birthday...cause, um, well, maybe it's not exactly  my  birthday, but if it were, would you disappoint me? That would be harsh, I would never recover. I'd be forever afraid to celebrate my birthday knowing there was a possibility that someone would disappoint me. So, yay????    Other thing:  Talked to the boy that I think/thought liked me and turns out hedoesn't. What a horrible birthday.... anyway. I didn't find this out the hard way. That's a good thing. But this is what my spidey senses are telling me-I can't believe I just said that. Well he left me a message and I called him back. I said hey it's thals and he said hey beautiful. I giggled. He said I called you earlier and I was disappointed when I got your voice mail cause I wanted to talk to you. I giggled, and said!! see that's why I called and asked to speak with you. I said assed..not asked...not axed...assed. I can't pronounce the k in that word. And he said well, thank you that just made my day. I said awww. Then I assed him a serious question and he said just to remind him when I come in again, he said "just talk to me then. You have to specifically ask for me." I said okay, I will definitely ask for you. Then, say it with me class, I giggled. Awww, how cute. Excuse me whilst I choke it back. I'm so gay around that kid. I hate that. But it's okay. But seriously people what ifhe doesn'treally like me and he's just uber nice. Oh well, I'll never knowuntil I know. I think I'll write him a note.  That's all.
