I just realized I was too busy going out with Ching and doing all the wedding preparation that I didn't even take as many pictures with you  Pogi at your house. I also wanted to show my mom what a great job you and Tito Rico did on your basement.  Anyhow, hope things are going well with you.  If you have time, please come and visit me here in Frisco with Ching and Brian!   Hey Daf, I love all those Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies!  I used to watch them a lot with my grandma.  She was very enamored by him.  I like those old movies coz they were very simple yet funny.  :)
