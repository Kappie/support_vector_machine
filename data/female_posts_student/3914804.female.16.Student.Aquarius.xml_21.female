I'm really looking forward to it, have already made some friends - and one of my best friends, Alison, is coming with me. So I'm not nervous. In addition to which I *love* the teachers already.My French teacher is both humorous (although not as incredibly entertaining as Madame Beattie (sob!) and clever. She is very encouraging and I enjoyed her practice lesson. My History and Law teacher is incredibly intelligent, shares all my political views and is very funny. (He looks like a cross between Daniel Bedingfield and Mr Brown!! hehe.) My English teacher is silly but ok!      *However*, despite its rather disturbingly snobby and stupid headmistress (at least Miss Gardener was an *intellectual* as oppose to financial, etc snob)and its obnoxious maths department (BITCH BITCH BITCH... SORRY), I'll really miss SHS. My History, French teachers were some of the nicest, most entertaining and intelligent people I have met. My friends have afforded me millions of hilarious and wonderful memories, and although I am very irritable and genuinely *like* only a selected few of them at a time, they have all contributed! hehe you can see how pompous and weird I get when I get nostalgic - you should see the Leavers' books!!... However, at least I don't have to get nostlagic over Saturday nights out, as I fully intend to continue to *be* at them.... mwahaha they cannot be rid of me !!!!      Anyway, after that immensely boring litany (I'm bored and only have two rather reticent people 2 talk 2 ok?!) I'll depart...
