"I'm a law student [discussing grade policy]...I take a f#%' and keep on truckin'." -More words of wisdom from Taylor (go section A)  "Its like the Good News Bible (in re: my "Let's Go" Europe travel guide), but without the Bible part." -Claire  My Let's Go guide is now referred to as "good news" and Claire is "Good News Claire."
