This point of view is getting stale.    This is one of my favourite tracks from Avril's new album. I really like it.. It's like one of those sk8er boi songs.  Haa haa ;)    I had my English oral prelims today and before that i saw my source of inspiration! When I waved at  Her Excellency , she was like, "Come come!" Then I followed her and held her huge water bottle and she spoke to me for a while. She had such bee-yoo-ti-pul eyes and her lipstick was like WOW red! Oops haa haa, my maid just asked why was I smiling to myself (o'_'o)  Dear Kalyn, don't get jealous alrighty? Haa haa. I still lub you anyways! Oh yupp, Her Excellency, Dear Kalyn, Ruthie babie, Amesie poo and I are supposed to go jogging tomorrow, but now it's just Dear, Ruthie, Amesie poo and I because Her Excellency has something important to attend tomorrow. So I guess Gabriel and Jiax won't feel much earth-quake-like vibrations on the ground afterall huh?? :P    Jiax and I just had lunch at IMM, we ate something incredibly sinful. * Sniffle * There goes my plan! So tomorrow I MUST run more.. Hee hee. I bought 3 pairs of coloured socks and 4 new rubber bands. YUMMERS! ;)    Now I'm just sitting in my living room,  anticipating  the next few hours of tuition. Poor Jeremy is sick. Get well soon brotha!    Mucho thanks to Choochoo, Fiona, HuiYing and Siti who helped out with the Class Project Boards! Oh yes, and all the ideas for the National Day Fun Fair, they're overwhelming thanks to Dear Kalyn, Jessica, LiuMing, Siti, Ruth and all who contributed! Wow great 1st week of June!
