Unfortunately I lack summary ability so if you want the details you will have to talk to me at some point.  Also, I'm leaving again tomorrow.  Hopefully I will be better about writing stuff down and typing it when I get home, but don't expect any posts in the next 3 weeks.  However, I love mail (and might have to sing for it if you send me enough) so write me often.  'Lena (CIT) Camp Kanata 13524 Camp Kanata Rd Wake Forest, NC 27587
