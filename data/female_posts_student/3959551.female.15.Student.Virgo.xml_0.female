The only bad thing about it is having to wait an entire week for the new episode and another look at that gorgeous guy theyve got playing one of the characters. Yep, His name isPatrick Flueger and he is Oh So Nice! Yeah so they fired Nick and Sarah off of CSI. Apparently for "breach of contract violation" which i think is Grade A bullsh*t. They didnt show up for the first day of filming the new season because they had asked for more money, as if they weren't making enough as it was, but thats beside the point! Those were two of the best characters on that show and now theyre gonna have to bring innew people and the CSI fans are gonna be pissed which means a drop in ratings and then maybe they'll realize how retarded they were to do that. Meh. I'll get over it eventually. This house selling gig isnt working out as it should. We have to sell our house in about the next 90 days if that and we've had people look at our house but the two couples that wanted it have to sell their own houses first. So, if we dont get a contract on ours before our new house is ready for the drywalling to be done then we lose the new house, and $1500 that my parents put in for contingency. If that happens we have to find a new house and begin all over with that one. But, my parents told me that I might have to start school at Azle again and then move to Keller in the middle of the year. Switching schools in the middle of my Junior year isnt my idea of a great school experience. I guess I'll have to deal though. I hate being made to do something that i dont want to do. Grrr.
