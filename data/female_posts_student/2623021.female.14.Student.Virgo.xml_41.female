He's cute and nice! :P He's blonde, that that it really matters Moi (my last interest) was a little angry with us earlier this week because we were playing wallball and we didn't let him play (hehe Suze)and he went over to one of our mutual friends and started freaking out about it, saying, "Oh she's over there playing wallball with HIM!" (BTW wallball isn't played with a wall and a ball it's something different) Moi and Mini are friends, I actually only met Mini because of Moi. +) Wow Ashlyn and I have been hanging out so much lately... last week on Friday and Saturday, and Today and Tomorrow. Suzy and I have been hanging out hard core also! Same with me and Felicia. Hard core chillin' with all of my friends! Old and new. People are so crazy! Being a teenager is so much fun! I only wish I was a little bit older... maybe 16? Ciao
