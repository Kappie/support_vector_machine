But I did hear the pastor read out Ecclesiastes 3:1-8. Here, for reader gratification ( New Living Translation) :   There is a time for everything,  a season for every activity under heaven.  A time to be born and a time to die.  A time toplant and a time to harvest.  A time tokill and a time to heal.  A time totear downand a time to rebuild.  A time togrieve and a time to dance.  A time toscatter stonesand a time to gather stones.  A time toembrace and a time to turn away.  A time tosearch and a time to lose.  A time tokeep and a time to throw away.  A time totear and a time to mend.  A time tobe quietand a time to speak up.  A time tolove and a time to hate.  A timefor war and a time for peace.   It makes you think... Many Christians have qualms about killing and going to battle, but when it's for a good cause, is it justified? The other acts mentioned are more straightforward. It's hard to know what to do sometimes, but I think people feel the most conflict when it comes to killing. That's why they pray :]
