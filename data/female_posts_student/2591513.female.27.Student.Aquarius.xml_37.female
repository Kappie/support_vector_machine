It saddens me that people carry around hate.  I know how it feels to truly dislike a person and what the person stands for, but you can't always get along with others.  I know that.  I don't want it to seem that I am not open to that, I am.  Yes I joke around about how I HATE her...but I don't.  I just don't agree with a lot of things she stands for.  But to say I hate her...no...I don't.  Our personalities just don't mesh well.  I put up with her though.  Oh well...my sister loves her, so my sister has to come first, before the dislike.  Well I understand the situation and why this certain person hates my sister...but geez...you're 27 years old now, let go of the hate and grow up.  I have had more people screw me over in bigger ways but I have had to grow and admit that there is nothing I can do to change what happened.  I am just annoyed because I didn't like this person to begin with, but was nice to her because she was my sisters' friend...and now she keeps playing this frickin' pity card and it is bugging me.  It is sad because I see people my age or older and they don't do anything with their lives.  They just stay in this party mode and act like they are still in high school.  HELLO high school was about 10 years ago...GROW UP!  I am just so tired of hearing about this drama.  It is so annoying and over petty ridiculous things.  Maybe because it didn't happen to me.  But hey, I've been played before.  The one guy I fell for in high school, the one who I clicked with at so many levels played me along...I always thought things would work out, but he had a girlfriend when he was going out with me...LMAO  Shoot, I remember being devastated.  I have only fallen for two people in my life him and Ed....maybe because he was so similar to Ed....and I liked that...we clicked at the same level...anyway he made me believe that we had something, but i was just the cool girl he could hang out with and do things with without the ties...oh well.  Lesson learned...and it is okay because I ended up with the one I wanted to be with all along and we have been happy ever since...  But my point was that I never hated the girl he was with.  Why?  She didn't do anything to me.  He just digged her more and wanted the relationship with her.  Of course I was hurt...but it was between him and I...and she didn't have anything to do with it.  So when you have a falling out in a relationship, don't blame anyone but the two involved...because it was the two of you who didn't make it work.  I guess that is what I am trying to say.  By the way, that was 10 years ago...damn...long time ago.  So yeah, I was thinking about going down to see my sister, but I can't drive, I still feel dizzy.  i don't know what it is...I hope they figure this thing out.  It was nice having her around.  I think it is healthy for her to live on her own.  I think that she is growing up now and finally doing things for herself.  That is a very important lesson for people to learn.  Oh geez...I am 27.  I don't feel it though.  I mean I do physically...but not mentally.  LOL  I am in denial, I guess.  I don't know.  Time sure does fly by.  Everything is so amazing, isn't it?  Okay, enough of my rambling.  I should get going.  I think the kids are finally done with their bath.  Nothing like hugs from clean smelling kids...LOL
