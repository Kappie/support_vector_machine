I did nothing all day went for lunch with Rhiannon and Ashley because my dad didn't make lunches last night so we went for lunch with my dads money and then we came back to the school and sat out side in the nice nice sun! It was awesome!!! I noticed that tease and Josh were together. Does Josh know yet? hmmmm awe it was so cute!  Anyway I went home after having a slack filled day and sun tanned while make posters and then I had a nice cold cold shower which felt nice.  Then I packed for the relay for life what a packing experience I was talking to rhiannon and michelle and packing!!! It was fun!  That night I went and danced my ass off again and we did awesome I must say! We did really really good! Didn't screw up once and the power stayed on the whole time!!!  After my last dance I met Michel and her parents at the front door and went to the Cancer Relay for Life and I must day it was amazing.  We all dressed up like Holy Family's Super hero's and it was awesome! We looked amazing and had a lot of fun!  There was the one thing I must say I loved most we had a flash light well it was Shawn's and it was a lion? I think yea! It was super cool I loved it! Hey Shawnee how much did you pay for it?! And where did you get it?! That would be perfect for camp man!!!:D LOL I am getting super excited anyway I should go to be because I have to do a car wash in I don't know under 12 hours Later Gator!
