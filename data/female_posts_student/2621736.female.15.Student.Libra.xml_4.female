Wed. the 26th: left for knoxville in the morning with bella, jason and dan. 3 hours or coloring books, playing presidents, finding walmarts to park RV's, and wrong numbered phone calls. this lady called my phone in the car wanting to talk to someone named "jason"...who was sitting next to me. it was the wrong jason though- weird coincidence. was very funny...anyway, we get to the dorms...the boys stayed together and me and bella with the adults of course. we played tug of war with our grimy disgusting beds for about an hour, trying to fit our brown (they were originally white) sheets on our beds. we slept with our beach towels instead. went to dinner and stuff with the team and discovered how bad the food sucked. then to the opening ceremony. lasers, lights, anthems, and two hours later was the much anticipated meeting with our turkish boys...who were   gorgeous  ...and really nice too. click  urlLink here  to witness the beauty. its acutally a horrible picture, but enlarge it and you'll get an idea. there was Alp- the one with the baby face that me and bella's moms thought had ADD...(you cant see him in the pic.) Gokturk- the one with the coolest name who liked guitars...(farthest right) Mert- my favorite. i thought he was the nicest and funniest...(holding the flag in the middle) and then there was Arda- the unbelievably gorgeous, flawless one who you just cant talk to cause he's so much prettier than you are...(holding the shirt.) so...anybody up for a trip to turkey?(caitlin, becca- i  promise  i'll get you those pics by sunday...next week at the latest when we do our shirts.) anyway, after opening ceremony, there was a "buddy team" party for us and the turks. 2 hours of obnoxiously loud music and me and bella giggling everytime we looked at Arda or any of the guys. by the end of the night stephen told alp that bella liked him and mert that i was in love with him. payback for us showing everybody pics of baby stephen on a leash. lesson for the day: when around jason for prolonged periods of time...dont wear a ponytail.  thursday: woke up to jason yelling that their toilet was overflowing...i go into a room that smelled like the inside of an ass and hot trash (hahaha ali...). gah it was gross. me and bella find a STARBUCKS! right down the road. yay! made us feel at home. instant challenge was that day. we sucked it up big...but whatever. we met some really cool people thursday too. there was SHWINK! (with the arms). she was fun, Kabalski- a frat boy that wore water willies and scuba gear on dry land, j. roark- a cop guy that me and bella felt the need to annoy, and walter- a really cool frat boy that looked like usher. he had the harry potter forehead scar goin on too. we took directions from him that got us lost for 3 hours. reggie- one of the people that came up with DI. she was sooo freakin cool..and then our other sick and twisted friends. they were all our judges. the boys got mad at us cause all our new friends were giving us pins...bella left her pins at home and i only bought one set. we ended up with more pins than the boys that spent over a hundred bucks each on pins...we got them out of spite for the boys. then there was Aaron- this amazingly cool guy who was one of our best friends. and dan s. wood...this creepy band cult kid...i dont know why, but we thought he was cool. until he started break dancing... anyway, after instant was the costume ball. me and bella wore our amazing Hammer pants. met the turkish boys there. no giggling this time. we were good. then we met this college kid Urisa and her husband, Husband Man. she was very cool. she does an awesome white boy dance. we left the ball cause the band they brought in sounded like evanesance on crack. the turks came back to our room and hung out for a while. friday was a free day so the oi's let us stay out a little later than normal. met these guys from colorado named and took a bus ride around campus for a couple hours with them for kicks. went back to the dorm and colored pooh bear pictures for the turks. me and bella are dumb. lesson for the day: if you go to UT, the potties are mean. your room will smell like ass for weeks. and dont take directions from frat boys.  friday: free day! or so we thought. we didnt have anything to do, but we were forced into watching like 8 teams compete. me and bella found our party bus with kareoke and Dwight, the driver. then we gave the pooh bear pics to the turks. Arda just like threw them away...asshole. then we met aaron and reggie and these really cool guys from TN. one had a HUGE Astro van with 2 Bazooka Tubes in the back. it was amazing. hung out with walter and Urisa and dan's little sisters. the oi's made us go to bed early, but me and bella stayed up and shwinked for a while. Lesson for the day: dont let boys use your shower...boys are gross. and they break things.  Sat: long term day. that sucked. had our first real meal in 3 days. closing ceremony...the same as opening. sucked. we got 15th out of like 48. got to go to the after party. that was fun. met the colorado guys, but i had to go home early cause my dad had a golf tournament the next day. Lesson of the day: dont park ya car in the havard yard...sounds better with the accent. and again, dont wear a ponytail.  so that was knoxville. all in all it was lots of fun. drivers ed started this week. i promise you, it will be the longest 2 weeks of your life. take it at brentwood driver's training. honigo's bday party yeasterday was fun. tomorrow, (sunday) is one of those park concert things again guys. its at 7. call or comment if you can come.   ps- trying to decide what color to paint my bathroom. penny for your thoughts?
