My roommates are fucking driving me crazy.  It's like they hate me.  Everything I do is wrong, and I am SO close to cracking.  I'm not asking a lot here, either.  I'm not asking them to kiss my ass and be my best friends.  I'm just asking that they....acknowledge that I exist, perhaps?  Yeah.  And it would be nice if they didn't constantly fuck with my shit when I'm at work.  Getting phone messages would be nice, instead of beating them out of them a week after someone calls.  I might not be the worlds best roommate, but I at least give phone messages and I don't fuck with their shit.  It's such rediculous bullshit.  Seriously.  Grandma is doing fine now.  She's been home for a while now, and got through her surgery well.  Ironically enough, it was some X-Rays that discovered the aneurysm no one knew she had.  Somehow I feel....inspired?  obligated?  to continue on with my quest for X-Ray school.  Damn I feel special now.  Anyways, as far as work, everything is normal there.  I'm still working an ungodly amount of hours, but I'm getting tons of fluoro experience, which I think will benefit me the most.  Nitia is teaching me all kinds of good stuff.  Hmm...you know, I'm glad I didn't get into the program this year.  With Jon in that class, I almost feel bad for the other students who don't know shit.  One smartass in the class of 24 is bad enough, but 2 would just be asking for trouble.  Besides, I want to be the ONLY shining star in my class.  Sorry, Jon.    Well, I think I've bitched and ranted enough for a while.  Until next time....
