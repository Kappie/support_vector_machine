Good gosh, have I gained THAT much weight??  Ew!! She, too, drools!! Great. Now I have 2 drooly cats. Wondrous!  And her fur is black. So, now I'm totally covered as an eskimo-- grey hair for my black pants, black hair for my khakis (which I just happen to be wearing now)!!!!   Moo, I want to sleep but I have to go to a party... =-(          "I'm Only Sleeping" by the Beatles   When I wake up early in the morning Lift my head, I'm still yawning When I'm in the middle of a dream Stay in bed, float upstream (float upstream)  Please don't wake me No don't shake me Leave me where I am I'm only sleeping  Everybody seems to think I'm lazy I don't mind, I think they're crazy Running everywhere at such a speed Till they find there's no need (there's no need)  Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away And after all I'm only sleeping  Keeping an eye on the world going by my window Taking my time  Lying here and staring at the ceiling Waiting for a sleepy feeling   Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away And after all I'm only sleeping  Keeping an eye on the world going by my window Taking my time  When I wake up early in the morning Lift my head, I'm still yawning When I'm in the middle of a dream Stay in bed, float upstream  Please don't wake me No don't shake me Leave me where I am I'm only sleeping
