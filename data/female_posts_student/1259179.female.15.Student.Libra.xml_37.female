We ran around like chickens still finishing details for her   A Breast Cancer Walk to Remember 2003 ~  .  Boy did we have a laugh and much more....  " Depends how you look at it "      My friend  urlLink    ~ Lori ~ (the blond one),    just left my house, we live next doors to each other, she is a Graphic Director Extraordinaire, just finished Sandee's signs for her Walk....  Lori is such a sweet person and has become a great great friend.  We have so much fun together.  We love the same things and watch   ~ The Bachelor ~   together in our PJ's , what a hoot.  Anyways, she has 3 kids, Trevor is 8, Jessica is 6 (7 Nov 1st) and Baby Shane is 4 months old. And she finds time to help out... That is the kind of girl she is...    I am sooooo fortunate to be surrounded by awesome ladies....  I love them to bits.  OK I am pooped so I am off to beddy bed so..................Be Good
