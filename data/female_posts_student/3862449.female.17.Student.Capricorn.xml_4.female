I decided todo a six hour day with no lunch break because i had to leave for a doctor's appointment at 2:30.I got a ton of work done in this time. In the morning i met with Dr. Baum and we talked about the progress i was making on the lists. I finished them them that afternoon and emailed them to her. i have become quite the expert at excel these last few weeks. We were supposed to take a tour of the physics department later that day, but the guy who was giving it never showed up. Since my work was completed, and i was leaving in 20 minutes, i walked over to the recreation center to try and get my card activated so i would be able to play raquetball. Something is wrong though and apparently we are still not on the system.
