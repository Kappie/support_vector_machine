(tuesday i have ballet class-i've almost been taking for a year now... ummm... yay i guess) mom (of course) remembered nothing. as if she ever does. and she was working. each time i started to say something she asked me "what do you want?" -oh, i'm feeling the love.- maybe if i don't eat breakfast or lunch either i will faint at band practice. then perhaps  momentarily  i'll forget that i'm not good enough
