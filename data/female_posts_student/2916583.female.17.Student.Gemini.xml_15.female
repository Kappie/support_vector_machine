That means regressing to a ten-year-old to play hide and seek, be loud, and snort at my dad's pronounciation of "de body of crees brokeen for ju" (translation: the body of Christ broken for you).  It was pretty fun.  Right now I'm playin mommy cause Leslie, an angel of a toddler when she wants to be, is wheezing in the next room.  I'm also very full from hawaiian bread, which, by the way, is the best bread ever.  Well ok I had a few ham biscuits, and some other stuff (not to be listed so I don't look like a glutton at a church function).  A new couple came today; they want to start a Spanish church in Chester cause the Spanish population here is increasing  210%  each year.  They want my dad to translate or something.  Anyway, their two boys are pathetic hide and seekers.  Brb I heard Leslie wheeze again.  Nope she's just snoring.  Well I think I'm going to take a third nap cause I want to be really awake for SNL.   That reminds me of something hilarious on Jay Leno (one of my favorite shows btw)...they made a kids' version of the board room from The Apprentice, and they had a kid that looked amazingly like Donald Trump with three kids.  Robbie, you peeked during hide and seek...Robbie, you're fired!  LOL!!  Later.    You are CLARISSA EXPLAINS IT ALL.  She is a rad chick with absolutely no fashion sense.  If you are a guy and chose this... you are gay.      urlLink   Which old school Nickelodeon show are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
