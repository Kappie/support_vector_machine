I ran and ran all day but still found time to figure out a few healthy meals (brats with a ton of kraut on them are healthy, right?) I didn't have much of an appetite all day, and found myself straining to gulp down a small supper portion. I think I am maturing, slowly but surely, and a major realization that I had today was that I sometimes will have to do things that I don't want to do, that may not be fun, just because they have to be done, and that is part of what an adult is all about. I bought some decent groceries tonight, so that will hopefully make things a little better, I tried to get things that were healthy and easy to prepare, hoping I won't want "bad" stuff then. I had a chocolate bar today, and a piece of hard candy, but that is better than yesterday, and that is what counts for me today, since all I have to do, I figure, is keep my healthy lifestyle changes working today, and that's it, tomorrow is another day.
