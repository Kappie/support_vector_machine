Tomorrow, tomorrow  We owe nothing to tomorrow; Tomorrow is out of our hands. Unlike the past, which speaks so sorely of our irrevocable  responsibilities;  Or the NOW, With it's confrantational assertion of  duties , Tomorrow asks nothing of us. It whispers sweetly in our ear like a tease,  Oh, take me, take me!   Spinning tales of pleasures on pleasures All promised in due time. It gives us descriptions of all that we'll have, Yet shows us nothing. Tomorrow is a  flirt,   But she flirts so well. When it comes time for tomorrow to give us -what we have been promised- To reveal what she has promised to, She is already  now , not  tomorrow  And Now is a different thing entirely. Now is  demanding;  She is  concrete;  She is where our duties live. Now is the trash waiting to be taken out; Now is the study-books unread on our nightstands;  Now  Is a very high-maintenance girl. So we find not  Tomorrow  but  Now  in our arms, Kissing us and instituting what Tomorrow promised, While at the same time making all these  -all too realistic-  demands. So we hold  Now,  yet we wonder Whatever happened to that flirty tease  Tomorrow ? We love  Tomorrow;  But she's always a day away.
