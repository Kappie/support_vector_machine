Its funny how life works that way. Just when you dont want to be seen, you are! I mean dont get me wrong i love hangin out with Holly, were really close and junk, but i just dotn liek beign seen by peopel when im all lets say uglified. So heres how it goes, Holly and I are walkign to mattics, we arrive and wander around get icecream and so on. As we leave the great Shannon Brown-John and Arielle ride by on their bikes (stupid showoffs getting excercise why i ougta..) so we chatted a bit and me n holl went on our merry way. Later on our walk home Suzie wetzer and her dear mom drive by (i wave lookign like a total dumbass) and then kristi merideth and soem chick walk by (i look away but then wounder why seeing as how i dont like them and they are losers...) So continues my story but now we are about 100m closer to the destination (home) and who passes us but Leanne and... Brittney...Stars-omethign-or-other. W/e thats not important. I mean Leanes nice (we exchanged a friendly hello). but what is the freaking deal!! does got purposly set people along your path when ur looking your ugliest? i dotn get it, a few days ago i went downtown all pretty and junk and i saw NO ONE i knew! like wtf! its not like i was trolling but stil.... i was mad   ...and i still am      xoxo Leslee
