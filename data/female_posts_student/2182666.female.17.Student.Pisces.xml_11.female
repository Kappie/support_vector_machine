"..i'll be true, i'll be useful, i'll cavalier, i'll be yours my dear and i'll belong to you, if you just let me through this is easy as lovers go so dont complicate it by hesitating.."  well there's not much on my mind right now except that food sounds really good :) bye guys and have a great night!!  jess
