I"m not a genius with cooking, it's more like gaya-gaya only and besides this recipes are not particularly from visayas.  So guys maybe you can ask your Moms for confirmation. Anyways there really is not much of  a problem, except that now that I am staying at home I am getting picky about these details, too much time maybe?????
