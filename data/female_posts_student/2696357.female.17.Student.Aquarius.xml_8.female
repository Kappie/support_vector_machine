I need to take advantage of it.   On a lighter note, today was pretty easy. I took a history SOL, which I totally dominated.   God, that class is so funny.  Especially with Rajai shouting at me/ jokingly saying "God, Amy, stop laughing...you can't look at me with a straight face".  He is right though, but I can't help it if he cracks me up :)  Its obvious that he digs me.  Hey, its all good *SMILES IN A CUTE WAY* hehehe Ahh, quote of the day:  "No one worth possessing can be quite possessed". Ummm, self-explanatory, but it SOOO fits me.  Until next time...
