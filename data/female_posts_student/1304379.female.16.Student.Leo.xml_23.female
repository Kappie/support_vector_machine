Owell, but I'm still coming online everyday! Though I try not to go onto MSN as often, or to appear offline, so that I'll go offline faster as well lah. Hmm.   Today has not been a conducive day. I've got bio prac test tomorrow as well. And, I think my Maths did improve. Heh heh. By leaps and bounds? Not exactly, just a little better. Okay, I shall stop answering my own questions. That's the problem with blogging, no one to answer questions you post but yourself.   SIX MORE WEEKS TO PRELIMS.      I'm not prepared! And at the rate i'm going, I seriously do not know where I'm heading.  To think I still can watch TV more than an hour per day and to be onine for more than an hour per day.  I'll be getting back my results tomorrow, which also marks the start of my NO TV/NET law EXCEPT on saturday AND on tuesdays to watch Singapore Brainiest. HAHA! So many concessions, but owell, we're humans too anyway.  And yesterday was lousy as well, i slept really early, or rather, fell asleep while attempting to read "To Kill a Mocking Bird".  It is a sin to kill a mocking bird, for a mocking bird does nothing but to sing for you. Oooh, I'm gonna try my best to read, digest, ingest and what-not it. But not egest. Okay lame.  Time is running out when I think about TIME generally. But why don't I think about it when I'm online or watching tv? TMD.  It's getting  HARDER  and  HARDER  to breathe!
