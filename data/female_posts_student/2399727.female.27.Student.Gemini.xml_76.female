My deepest, deepest sympathies go out to her family and friends tonight.  Also made the mistake of watching Life's  urlLink Little Miracles  tonight. It featured a little girl, Alyssa, born with congenital eye disease.  Her doctors attempted to reattach her retina and remove some scar tissue to give her partial sight.  It wasn't successful and she is now a happy, totally blind little girl.  Her story just killed me to watch it; I had a bad feeling as soon as they said what was wrong with her.  Her mom and dad had to wait weeks until the swelling reduced in her eye to know if the retina had been successful reattached or not; the waiting is the hardest part.
