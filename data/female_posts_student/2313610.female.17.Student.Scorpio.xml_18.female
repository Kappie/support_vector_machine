Catch it, tie it up and play boy band songs to it until is has no more willpower of self confidence left."   I'm too lazy to change my quote right now. It's two in the morning and I haven't slept in about thirty-nine or so hours now. Hmm... I don't want to sleep. Right now, I'm so afraid that all of this is one big dream and I'm going to wake up and go back to that harsh existence I call reality. This euphoria is much more preferable.  I suppose, as usual, I should explain myself. Well, I'll tell the tale of the past two days. Yah... It's really two, and I'm really tired, but I want to write this all down, perhaps to prove it all genuine.  I spent the fourth of July with a friend of mine. It was a fun movie filled event, three of which I had seen, but I saw  The Girl with a Pearl Earring.  It was beautiful. It really was. I need to read the book before my sister hits me upside the head with it though. She can be really evil sometimes. Anyway, no great fireworks to report. I think they're getting skimpy. Though I did see a rogue firework. Bad news in this drought. I hope it didn't burn anything down. I stayed up til ten in the morning.   We ran to Walgreen at two and got soda and believe it or not condoms. She got them, the were her choice after all, but I managed to get one and it's in my drawer. I thought it was amusing. It was basically a girl's all out fun fest. My friend and I talked and I told her things that I never told some of my other friends, and I felt better for saying it.  After I went home, it would have been logical to sleep. I had a friend coming after all, and I looked a bloody mess. Logic, is not my strong point. Probably why I suck at math so badly. Therefore. I went into my mom's room and noticed I had a package for men from Hong Kong. I spent several minutes staring at it. Who the hell did I know from Hong Kong? I called my mom about it just as it occurred to me. I know who sent this to me. Turns out it was a Pucca and Garu doll from the guy I've been arguing with. It was scarce minutes after that when I got his phone call.  I specifically told him not to call.  As though I'm listened to anyway. Do no call seem to mean, except when I'm depressed... A twenty-four seven condition. He was having issues here, and, for his privacy, I won't get into them. Besides. It's a small bad part of a good day. Plain and simple.  The guy I was waiting to call was an hour late in calling. He had slept in... Lucky... After like an hour of getting things together, we actually managed to get him here. It was a miracle. I saw him for a scant amount of time once a year ago, and I otherwise had had no contact with him. I was so happy. Happier than I had been in a while. Especially after week of hell.  I'm still struck, even now by how tall he is. He used to be shorter than me, back in like middle school, but he's at least a head taller than me now, something he rubbed in a few times. His voice had also changed, deeper and something I was unaccustomed to, but I liked it anyway. It suited him.   We talked for a few hours in my room after that. A lot of it catching up, a lot of it joke telling. I had forgotten how much he used to make me laugh. He's also gotten a lot of stronger than me, not that it's difficult. I'm not at all known for muscle, but it was fun trying to pretend I did. It reminded me of old times. He was, after all, one of the best things about middle school.  Neh, he's gonna be reading this... Fuck, I hate this ego thing...  Ok, then we went out to the living room and we ended up watching a reality show my family's fond of, and we started cuddling on the couch. At first, I thought little of it. Not the first time, not the last. Then his fingers started stroking my upper arm. His other hand was touching min, running up and down my other arm. I lost all interest in the show then. I watched his fingers trail over my skin with fascinated eyes. I didn't dare mention it. I was so afraid of breaking the moment. Afraid he'd realize what he was doing and stop. So I happily played along with the game, my fingers playing with his as I buried my head in his shoulder.  I'm telling it like an author... It's nearly three now, so... neh...  This continued for sometime, and I sat there, completely petrified of ruining it. The damn Fae who run my blog know I haven't had a boyfriend in ages. Forgot what it was like. I relearned very quickly when we started kissing.  I was positive that the line between dream and reality had faded into nothing, or that I had fallen asleep and I was dreaming the feel of lips on mine. I even told him so, and he assured me of the reality... As though there's anyway to assure half dead psycho of reality. I'm still not sure it's all real. Not sure if it even happened. Not sure if all the wonderful things that happened afterward were all dreams.  There's only one thing that I'm sure was real. That was the water. We walked down to a pool. I say "a" pool because my complex has about six. He got us both wet while we were wading in the water, and I dream about water so often that the reality of the water struck me. I could feel water. It was cold and it was wet, and this was real.   It's a completely amazing though, and I know that this euphoria won't last, but for now I want to enjoy it.  I want to hope I see him again.  Faylinn out.
