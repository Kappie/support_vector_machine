Listening to music, old music, good music - Ace of Base (Cruel Summer) and the new song My Immortal by Evanescence is really good and the song Breathe by Michelle Branch is good.  I have been out driving a lot.  I always drive out to Melissa's house in the N.W. all the time and I am getting way better at driving.  My mom even said I parallel parked better than her.  That is the first time I have ever heard my mother say something good about my driving.  I am worried about Bio now too.  I am doing "ok" in it, but this unit is suppose to be easy and like I find it confusing.  She keeps giving up worksheets and assignments and stuff but she hasn't taught us much about the unit.  So how am I suppose to know the answers?!?!  Also apparently marks have to be in at the end of next Friday, but I still don't know my English mark.  All I have to get is over 75%, that is it, then I am on distinction.  I worked hard all year, I deserve to be on there.  Hopefully I get nominated for Habits of Mind.  God and the world knows I deserve it.  No one nominated my last semester, and well someone is bound to nominate me.  Someone will and I know it, I know it in my heart that from the beginning of the year I deserved it, and I still do.
