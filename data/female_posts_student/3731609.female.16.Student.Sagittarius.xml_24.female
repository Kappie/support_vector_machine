The next day Aunt Monty and Uncle Jerry renewed their vows, and there was quite the party. My cousin Rachael is so funny, I def. need to hang out with her more. After dark Natalie, her friend Amber, and I started drinking, and it wasn't long before I was really drunk. There was this guy named Phil, or hot guy #3. He was def. trying to get with me, and it was fun flirting with him. But then my uncle called me over and said he was watching me, very protective, and kind of scared the guy off.  The next day was the DAVE concert. It was amazing. Natalie and I got drunk and then went dancing all over the place. So many guys tried to get in our pants, kissing us, but we danced and had a GREAT time. I love Dave, and I love the concert, get drunk and dance atmosphere. I must continue going to great concerts.  Here is the set list:  Donâ€™t Drink the Water One Sweet World Fool To Think Sugar Will Stay Lover Lay Down I Did It  Seek Up Rhyme  Reason Hello Again Joy Ride Loving Wings Where Are You Going Jimi Thing Crash Drive In Drive Out What Would You Say Crazy Easy Tripping Billies
