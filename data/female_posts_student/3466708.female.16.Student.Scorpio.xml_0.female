Umm I'm in grade 11 and mostly, I enjoy school. I like seeing people every day and hanging with my friends and on occasion I learn some interesting stuff. I plan on attending college nearby and then maybe later university (Ryerson I hope!) and I'm looking forward to that because everyone says that it's a totally difference experiance from highschool so that should be interesting right? If I don't go, I'll feel like I missed out anyway. lol I plan on becoming a journalist so I'll probably try to get my bachelor of journalism. I would really like to write for magazines, maybe a teen magazine. No, not because I like doing my hair, make up and talking about hot guys (Ok I do but that's besides the point!) but because I want a job in which I can reach out to people..through writing because that's what I love to do..and teenagers are the ones I would really like to communicate with.  I find us interesting. lol But anyways what else..well, I live with my two younger sisters and both my mom and my dad. We all get along abnormaly great. When I was younger, I used to wish that something bad would happen in my life. I know that sounds fucked up but it all seemed too perfect to me and I felt like an outcast. Rather hard to explain. I'm a happy gal, it takes a lot to get me really down although I am pretty moody. I think that comes with being a Cancer. I don't believe all those horoscope bug shit that people tell ya but when it comes to the descriptions of the signs, man, I've gotta believe that because it fits me to a tee. lol I am emotional, sensitive, caring..I suppose I do have high standards when it comes to guys and maybe that's why I don't date much. Who knows. I'm not really looking for a boyfriend, I just go with a flow..I'm quite laid back.  So yeah, I dunno what else to tell all of ya'll. I was born in the city, now I live in a small town so I've sorta got those two sides to me. We'll see how that turns out.  I want to travel more in the future, there are a lot of amazing places out there to see.  I've been to Cali, Mexico and Hawaii, oh and I'm going to Costa Rica later this year..that's about it really and although those places are beautiful and a lot of fun, they aren't all that exotic yanno? Ahk. My bio is getting too long, no one wants to read all this about lil ol' me! Even I don't. ^_^   So that's enough for now.   I watched the movie Gothika today. It's alright. Fairly suspenseful and the storyline was okay. Nothing to get too excited about though. ^.^  I wrote 2 poems today. Yeah, big deal, I know. Your sarcasm has been noted. =P Naw, but I'm happy 'cuz I haven't been writing lately and a lot of my poems, well, I don't even like them.  I haven't been writing for long tho, I'm still "growing". Heheh. I'm reading a Creating Poetry book by John Drury and it's fairly interesting. It gives you all these exercises to do which I like. I'm learning goiys, wheee! Hmm...perhaps I'll show you guys the finished poem I wrote today. Chances are I'll make changes it to later, I always end up doing that but oh well.  So this dude(Donald Justice) wrote a poem called On the Night of the Departure by Bus which was a redone version of Rafael Alberti's On the Day of His Death by an Armed Man and so I decided to give it a shot and so I wrote my version of On the Day of His Death by an Armed Man.  Which basically means I took the same idea and just made each line different. Make sense? Okay, here you go.   On the Day of the Last Trip by Train  Don’t try to tell me that you weren’t happy back then. 25 was more than an arms length away. A peanut butter and jam sandwich was still considered  fine dining.  I promised you with silent kisses that I would never grow old You promised me with silent kisses that you would never grow old. The silent kisses promised us both that growing old was inevitable by all standards.  Who would wish themselves dead?  The scribbled notes should be thrilled to have become literature. The withered bodies to have been silently kissed. And I for having the honor to admire the sheer simplicity of your Reeboks in the winter.   A fish is happy to have escaped the hook. The teenager for finding her once beloved teddy bear. And I…           I am happy that I can still cry real tears.                   Tears of joy or of sadness                         tears of…                   What does au revoir mean?  -Sophie MacCallum   And Rafael Alberti's original...   On the Day of His Death by an Armed Man  Come right out and tell me if those weren't the good old days. 5x5 was not yet 25 nor had the dawn considered the pointless existence of knives gone  dull.  I swear to you by the moon I won't be a cook, you swear to me by the moon you won't be a cook, he swears to us by the moon he won't even be smoke in such a sad kitchen.  Who died?  The goose is sorry for being a duck, the sparrow for being a professor of Chinese, the rooster for being a man, and I for having talent and marveling at how miserable the sole of a shoe usually is in winter.  A queen has lost her crown, a president of a republic his hat, and I... I believe that I have lose nothing, that I have never lost anything, that I...  What does buenos dias mean?  -Rafael Alberti
