All the promises I've made that I haven't kept. All the promises I've made myself that have almost killed me. All the terrible things I've done, and all the ones I'm capible of doing. What's really going to happen. Who I'm leaving. What I'm losing. Who doesn't really care...  I think that's what hurts the worst. Who doesn't really care.  But then again...  Why should I?  One question still haunts my mind.  How little of a difference do I really make?  Would you really care if you never saw me again?
