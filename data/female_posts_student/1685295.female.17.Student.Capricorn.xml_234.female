That was just for those of you who celebrate this stuff. For the rest go crawl into some damp hole somewhere... No really I mean it. Actually I don't... Something is going to blow right up in my face, I can feel it. Last night I didn't really get that much sleep. It could've been because of my mom's snoring, perhaps it was the fact that I didn't listen to NELMPA. Man did I screw that one in the ass, it was like doing a donkey or a donkey doing you. That could have been my mom's snoring too... Anyway, strike one, and and I am still at bat. "Hope the govermen' don' comw' afta' mah teef." Wish me luck and basketballs.
