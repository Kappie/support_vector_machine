Today I got a new lab partner, but it's not a good thing, contrary to what I thought it would be. So, I no longer have to deal with Hope and all our arguments, but now I have to deal with Patrick. I normally like Patrick all right and he's pretty cool to talk to, but lately he's been a real jerk, and today was simply not good in chemistry. He argues with everything I say and extends everything to insufferable whining and drama. Normally, I could deal with that all right, but I am under lots of pressure lately, and my home is very full of drama lately, so I'm not sure how this will work out.   I'm definitely not looking forward to Patrick's next bad day; we seem to have bad days simultaneously, too, and if you know me, then you likely know that that will not be a good thing at all if I'm approached the wrong way.   Besides that, any fun that I might have gotten out of chemistry class is pretty much shattered. I cannot begin to describe just how much amusement I got from watching Michael and Jay's modes of strange communication and laughing at Jay. Really, now! All my entertainment's gone.  Well, at least I'm at Katherine's table now. And I no longer face the board... again. Meh.  Otherwise, my day wasn't particularly bad, other than the fact that I've been sneezing and sore-throated and runny-nosey all day. I've been sick pretty much all week, and it is not so cool. The next 1.5 weeks will not be very nice.    Well, on the bright side, tonight I'm home and kicking back for the most part. I'm about to have some really good hot cocoa, so that makes up for a not-so-terribly-awesome day, right?   "Smoke" by Natalie Imbruglia   My lullaby  Hung out to dry What's up with that It's over Where are you, dad Mom's looking sad What's up with that It's dark in here  Why bleeding is breathing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I used to  My mouth is dry Forgot how to cry What's up with that You're hurting me I'm running fast Can't hide the past What's up with that You're pushing me  Why, bleeding is breathing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I used to  Why, believing is breathing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I saw you crawling on the floor Why, bleeding is believing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I saw you crawling to the door Why, bleeding is believing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I saw you falling on the floor
