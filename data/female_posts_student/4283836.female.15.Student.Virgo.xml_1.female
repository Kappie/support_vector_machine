I want to be 16, want to be legal... for lottery. Don't smoke don't want sex just want the blummin' lottery so that I can win the jackpot, and then everything would be perfect right?      My wardrobe would be, maybe my bank balance too. Had hardly any money to do much this holiday, so we've been making our own fun. Having sud fights on sleepovers and watching movies that confuse the heck out of you and make you even more tired than you were to begin with. The best bit was the D-Side meeting- the girls had never been so happy at meeting someone famous. Of course, they weren't the number one choice of who we would like to meet, but one thing is that Cabbagers aren't fussy. One day Duncan and Co will come to us instead of us going to find them, believe me it will happen!!      We made Saz almost cry with pain because of her eyebrows. We gave her a slight transformation. She looked gorgeous before and she does now too, but it was fun. I think this Summer has been the blondest yet, we've been pretty stupid, but we're only teenagers for another 4 years, and we're making the most of it.      Don't want a boyfriend. Not unless Jamie Scott is offering, but he's a tad too old for me. Still gorgeous though. Liam can go and jump, he's weird, a lot weirder than other ones. I'd say he's weirder than Darren but maybe that's going a tad far.      I gave Darren the first two chaps to Angel of Mine. Big Mistake? Yeah, I think so. I could have sent a better one, and now when he next sees me he's going to laugh, as much as I did when I saw the That's Girl video yesterday. Those guys are MENTAL and they're taking over the world; SpiderHarry is on his special missions and I'm sure the others are busy conquering the world too.      Tots and I had plenty of freaky moments tonight. But she's the freak, the witch, the blonde thing that copies everything I say. Maybe she's telepathic, and trying to scare me. Well she's doing a pretty good job of it!
