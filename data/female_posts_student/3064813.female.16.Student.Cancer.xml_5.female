The break in my lies will then become a malevolent entity and do all sorts of unspeakable things over there between the working links.  But what to name it?  I dunno, I should probably get some sleep.  I am, however, determined to use up all of my computer time, which may or may not be a healthy thing.  What IS a healthy thing is family movie time.  I, generally speaking, hate family time UNLESS it is a worthy movie and has no crappy moral that drives the entire movie. Don't get me wrong; what's the point of a movie if it's not trying to prove something?  But I just can't stand it when... ugh.  I dunno how to explain it, but I think you know what I mean.  Most of the movies you find in the family section at blockbusters are the evil movies, and I (mostly) hate them.  To be fair, SOME of them are good, but....  That's only a tiny minority against the raging, shitty masses. Anyways, to my point. I had such a great day today.  I woke up at seven this morning, got into my bathing suit, and took off with my family down to Surfside beach for some FUN in the SUN which resulted in my sunscreen wearing off and my shoulders and cheeks getting horribly fried.... But oh well, right?  The thing that is creepy/cool about right now is that I can still feel the undertow and stuff.  Like you know how after you ride a merry-go-round all day, when you lay down at night you can still feel yourself spinning around?  Just like that, and it's FREAKING me out becuase I keep wanting to grab onto something to keep myself from being pulled out. But, right.  After we left the beach (and after eating yummy apricot jelly/peanut butter sandwiches) we drove around in Galveston for a while (I fell asleep) and then shot off home.  Once in the comfort of my own four walls, I promptly covered myself with aloe vera in an attempt to prevent the unsightly peeling of my (red) skin.  My family was then dragged to Outrigger's for a upper middle class burger (cannot beat Billy's Burger in Jackson Hole, WY).  I enjoyed (not) the sun on my arms, or the clothing in general (lots of pain, poor me...).  Despite all that I had a blast.  We then ran off BACK to the house, where conversation was made about washing my dad's car.  I avoided this topic and gently demanded that we watched Joe Versus the Volcano. I demanded this for several reasons, one of which being that it is possible the rockingest movie ever.  That's not to say that it has good special effects or a reasonably coherent plot.  Pshaw, that'd be STUPID.  It does, however, present Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, a shitload of philosophical mumblings, and a huge-ass ant-hill (can't think of anything) of symbolism.  That movie kicks ass, to say the very least. It ALSO makes a debut in TWO of my links.  Woohoo!  Anyways, I think my skin was just torched, so I'm going to go find some aloe vera and take a bath in it.
