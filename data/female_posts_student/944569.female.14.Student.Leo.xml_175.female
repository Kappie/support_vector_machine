It is always hard to get over a heartbreak and it's annoying when people tell you that you're being stupidly sad for no reason, especially if they've never experienced rejection before.  Sometimes you just gotta put up with it but sometimes if people get to hurt, they completely stop loving.  It's like the porcupine dilemma.  Porcupines would like to become friends but the closer they get, the more they hurt each other.  So, if you love someone, don't become close friends.  You'll only end up hurting each other badly.  After all, one year you could be the best pair in the world and afterwards they become friends with someone elsee and all communication ends.  Wouldn't you say that the best way to not hurt people is to stay away from them?
