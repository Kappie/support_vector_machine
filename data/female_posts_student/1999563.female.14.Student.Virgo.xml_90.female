Oh...and while Sara and I were in a corn field I also found out that I say bad funny-ish. Where did this accent come from??? I think its from living in washington all my life- it can do crazy thigns to you.  I just went to Winco. A grocery store place...  :) I saw AUSTIN, BRANDON, and  CARTER!!! Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!  Shout out to them. They rock. They were all making fun of me buying shaving cream for ASB. Its not my fault CAM is messed up. :P  I also had to buy 2 bags of marshmallows. Yummmmm   I better go...  Love,  Laura Fantora!
