Of course, I probably shouldn't trust my intuition. -_-  Since I've gotten back from school (at 12:30), I've eaten, ran around, posted on the Sublunary forum, ran around, drew (a chibi Yuushi - one of the characters of Subby), and (now) posted on my journal.  Now, it's time to scream (and perhaps cut my head off to stuff it with cotton), since Physics exam is tomorrow. I figured I shouldn't care what note I get, because I'm not taking the subject next year. And even if I get a C, my final note will be a B. Hn.  Anyway, I'll study when I'm back from babysitting. *grumbles* Ah yes... money-wise, should I get a job? I mean, I might be needed for babysitting, but that's not that much money. And I got a job offer at the stables I ride at, but only for the summer camps - two weeks - and my mom would have to bring me there. On account that I can't drive yet... *coughs* I have to pass my basic driving test first.
