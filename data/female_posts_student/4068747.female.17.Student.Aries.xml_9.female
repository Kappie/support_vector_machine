There’s no movement, no noise- everything’s silent. I worry that I will be in this darkness forever; all alone. Feeling lonely and desperate, I try and recall the last time I wasn’t in darkness;  when I felt anything other than sorrow. My thoughts are screams in a noise-proof room. No one can hear them. I truly am alone. I feel as if there is no use-  I give up. Nobody is out there, my sun has set and eternal darkness has risen. Then from out of nowhere,  something unexpected happened. The sorrow I feel has disappeared  the darkness, lifted. The imprisoning walls have tumbled, been smashed into nothingness.   My sun rose,  and I am surrounded by light again. As I rise to my feet, I begin to shut my eyes- for the light is overpowering. I resist the urge though; I had lived in darkness long enough. I open my eyes wide and all I can see is you standing in front of me; your arms spread out wide,  beckoning me toward you. I run and jump in your arms; all my sadness and doubt is gone. You have rescued me from my prison; sheltered me from the darkness. The chains that bound me here have been broken. I am free. My worries escape me, as a soul escapes a dead body. The burden is gone,  leaving me with nothing but faith- faith in you, and in life. I feel lighter. All this heavy weight has left my body. I am carried out of the ruins, and my one and only thought I think is "I am alone no more."
