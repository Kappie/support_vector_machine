I had a really shitty day today. We were supposed to have a showing today so we cleaned the entire house. It took at least three hours. Then after we left, the realitor called to say it was cancelled. They called one minute after it was scheduled to start. We were a little mad, to say the least. I had to take the garbage out at one point, and I ended up getting stung between the toes by a yellow jacket. I had a dream last night that we sold the house, and this morning I thought it was real. Then band camp. That in itself is self explainable. Still though, the walk home was nice. A little lonely though.  I wish I had my Blanket. ~Kristin
