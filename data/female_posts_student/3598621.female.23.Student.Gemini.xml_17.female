I didn't come across much interesting things about attitudes today... just throwing in some random quotes for now. I didn't like the way that these ideas are presented but the ideas themselves are not too bad.  This is important to be realistic, because only by being realistic can we formulate goals and strategies that are practical and attainable. In order to define achievable our goals, we need to know our own strengths (or assets) and weaknesses (or liabilities). A tinge of optimism is good so that we are not easily discouraged. It gives us hope. Pessimists are usually discouraged even before they begun, or if they have begun, they gave up too easily without a fight.   This should be our attitude towards life: I should say, do and write such that I would not be afraid or ashamed if they were heard, seen or read by others. I should think such that if another were to ask for my thoughts, I would be able to say them out loud without shame.  Be such a man and live such a life that if every man is such as you, and every life a life like yours, this world would be a paradise.    Our attitude in life determines our destiny. Change our thinking and we change our lives.   One of the keys to being successful in anything you do is persistence. Persistence in fighting with challenges is not unlike persistence in weight training -- it gets you to grand goals eventually. Road blocks are part of life, if you don't encounter any of them, chances are you are not really challenging yourself. The vast majority of successful people have had way more "failures" than they've had successes. Walt Disney was turned down 302 times before he got financing for his dream of creating the “Happiest Place on Earth”. Colonel Sanders spent two years driving across the United States looking for restaurants to buy his chicken recipe. He was turned down 1,009 times. Every time you do something, you learn from it so that you'll do it better the next time.
