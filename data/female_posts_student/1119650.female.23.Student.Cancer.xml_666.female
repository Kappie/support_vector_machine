This is sad and a bummer in and of itsself, but last Saturday my dog, Buddy, (the one we adopted back in August) had to get put to sleep because he had lymphosarcoma.  Not a really great last week by any standards.  We had 2 dogs and 6 cats and they're all around the same age and yes, thankfully all of them are very old, meaning we've spent the large part of my youth/teenage years/ young adulthood with them, but now they're all kind of dying off at once and its indeed very sad.  )c:
