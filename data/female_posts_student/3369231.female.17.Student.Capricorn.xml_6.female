I should really learn to watch where I am going to sit down, when I am going to sit down under a tree in the woods.  Cause yea, you can get poison oak that way.  It wasn't that bad... but then 2-3 days ago, I got it in the corner of my eye near my nose.. and then I woke up on Sunday and  my throat and eye were swollen.  Fun stuff... now the oak is in my eye and throat.  Fun Fun Fun Times.  I stole a saying from my buddy... he always says "good stuff" or "good times" or just stuff like that.  Now, I am saying it, ahhhhh!  :-) Oh well
