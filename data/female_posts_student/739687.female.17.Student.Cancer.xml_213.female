And we sit down, and these 2 girls are sitting diagonal from us. And I notice that every time I talk..the brunette girl stares. So i was like nervously glancing over there every few minutes like "why the hell is she staring at me..." Then her blonde friend starts turning around and looking at me, and looking back, and they keep saying stuff. So, this goes on for about 10 minutes, and by that time I was anxious to leave because they were making me completely uncomfortable. Then all of a sudden, the brunette walks over and is like "My friend and I have noticed that you've been staring at me and I wanna know if you have a problem with me or something." *Ironic, because wait...I haven't been staring. Damn bitches.* So I immediately get like pissed and I'm like "Ya know..I don't recall that  I  was staring at you." And she was like "Hey, you don't have to get an attitude with me." And so I'm like "Actually, I think I can get an attitude if I want, thanks." So she goes "If you wanna get an attitude then we can take this outside." And I was just like "No, ya know what...I'm good." So we had gotten our check already, we pay and leave. Guess who follows. The two bitches. By the way, they look like they're in college or something, and I honestly wonder how much of a life they would have to have to be that GAY. So I see them following and I'm all like "Excuse me...do you have a problem." And the brunette starts cussing and being gay, and then comes up and slaps me. So Rachel drops her car keys, which Becky grabs to get our getaway van. Rachel punches the bitch in the face  so damn hard , and she's totally out of the fight. Then this blonde bitch comes after me, and tries to like restrain me or something, but I punch  her  in the face and kicked her a few times, until Becky shows up with the van and we HAUL ASS outta there. Oh my gosh...it was the craziest thing ever.  Wow. Is that not like...a crazy story? Yeah, all you people who are like "Shauna's a pansy"...wait till I get that adrenaline. I just felt like this rush of anger, and I just totally went out on the one girl. And when Rachel punched the brunette that was bitching in the first place, it was like the coolest thing ever to watch. I wanted to scream "owned bitch!", but I was too busy owning the other one.  Ahhhhh crazy. Well, I could probably go on alot longer, but I think that I'll just quit for now.  G'night crazies.
