It made me laugh because we just did that problem in WA history. Haha. 27 days! So I was making a shirt for spanisha nd I totally killed it. It was sooooo coool until I had to put a picture on it and I didn't realize how big the iron was and I melted all the letters. Haha. Its pretty horrible. So, now if I want to do the t-shirt project I will have ot buy a whole new t-shirt and letters. Grrr there goes 10 bucks. *siiighhh* I hope this guy doesn't loose!! He doesn't know the answer..yeah. Sad timeees. Lala.  Today I had improv. It was ok. We just played games and such. Yeah. Tomorrow I get to go see Dean and Kerry in Portland. How exciting! I am going to bring my camera and take lots of pictures and post them on my photo blog. Wahooo.  I better go, later days.  Haha. Thats what they always used to say in the "Weekenders" lol  Laura
