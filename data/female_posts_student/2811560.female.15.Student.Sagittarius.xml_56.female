Anyways, Emily and I went to Mr. Snoeck's "Retirement Open House" thingy....now, let me tell you, THAT was a party, lol. We just kinda sat there and ate cake the whole time, it was great. We talked to a few people, but other than that, we just ate. Fun. And so then I went over to Emily's for a while, mostly just because I didn't want to go home, but yeah. We sorta sat around and listened to classical music and talked. Yeah, we're lame, but whatever. So then it was off to Paul's, yay! We watched Sleepy Hollow and then just talked. It was too bad I had to leave at 10 because I would have wanted to stay longer. I think he's comin over here next weekend, good times. And today, I have to learn my jury, yuck. And I should memorize my marching band music, but I don't really know where it is at the moment...yeah. That sucks. Oh well. Whatcha gonna do?
