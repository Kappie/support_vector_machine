He was a major John Wayne fan but an avid and knowledgeable film buff overall. I feel as if I'm trying to engage his attention, if he were ever to watch something I made and didn't fall asleep or walked out, I'd be proud.  Q: How did you meet your boyfriend? A: Through a school friend. We went out for a bit and it didn't work, two years later I got in touch with him, we tried it again and here we are eight months later.  Q: Why is it good to be a woman? A: I don't know, why is it? I hate PMS, I've mood swings, depression, I'm a binge eater, I'm rash, emotional, self concious of my body, and I have food allergies that result in bad skin. If I was a man, no woman would date me, I'd be too much of a girl. I like looking at my tits on the mirror and playing with them, when I sleep I tuck my hand under my shirt and keep it between them, it's very soft and warm. I think that's the best bit.  Q: Are you a religious person? A: I wish I was. I'm too much of a moron though. I know quite a bit about religion actually but I emphasize of doing the exact opposite of what is right, it makes it hard to try and be Christ-like. I have the will power to be, I know, but I just feel soo weak.  Q: What country would you love to visit and why? A: England. I don't know, I'm not sure. I've romantiziced the place I think. I love Jane Austen's work, Harry Potter, the legends of Kings and Knights like Arthur and his round table, I'm facinated by castles and mannors, I'd like to take a tour of Buckingham Palace,  see Manchester United play, I think the English accent is lovely second alone to the Mexican accent, I'm a devoted fan of Shakespeare and Wilde plays, and I'm a great fan of John Hannah, Hugh Grant, and Beckham.
