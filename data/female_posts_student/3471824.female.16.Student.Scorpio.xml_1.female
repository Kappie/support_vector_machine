And yet I have never been able to shake the realization that my friends are off talking to their real friends outside in the halls. I can't seem to forget that they'd rather be with other people.  MUDwolf is seriously unfair. I've been helping snivelling newbies for gods knows how long now, and still I'm not even considered for immortality. Whereas Azuriel, who does NOTHING but chat all the time (seriously), has now become one. I deserve it way more than she does! I actually DID something. But nooooooooo. Supposedly it's because of that b**** saskii...
