       
      Everytime i finally think that maybe i've gotten things cleared up, and as uncomplicated as things get in my life, everything manages to twist and buckle under the pressure, and then it's all screwed up again. i can't even begin to count all the mistakes i've made in life. The next one just feels so entirely awful, that i can't even begin to comprehend it, or even start sorting it out. i want to fall beneath all the pain and hardships, and just stay there, suffocating in my own mess. Damn, i'll finish this later... Must dash.
