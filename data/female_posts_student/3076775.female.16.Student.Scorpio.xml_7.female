Then I looked at my clock, thought it was broken, and went to talk to my mom, who had just woke up to answer the phone. Anywho, I went back to sleep, then woke up at 5:35, cut off my alarm clock, then fell back asleep. I ended up getting up at 5:50, took a quick shower, got dressed, and left the house. got to school...nothing very extraordinary happened. lol. gah!!! TIM'S GIRLFRIEND WAS TELLING ME ABOUT PEOPLE TRYING TO STEAL TIM FROM HER!!!!!! who would go out with Tim in the first place, let alone STEAL him from someone?!!!!! She said that she didn't think I'd try and steal him, and I was just in shock thinking......why would I steal HIM?I mean, I've got a guy of my own who I'm perfectly happy with, heh, got no business trying to steal Tim......*ish disgusted at the mere thought* I'm such a cruel person for saying such a thing.....ah well. ANIME CONVENTION IS FRIDAY!!!!!!!!!!!! I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!! It's going to be so much fun!!! anywho.....I'm going to go exercise now. Love, Shannon "Holy batflaps, grandma!"--Jeff Foxworthy
