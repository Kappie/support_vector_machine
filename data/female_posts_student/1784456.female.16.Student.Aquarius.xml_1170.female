Hey, so what's every one doing for New Year's Eve into New Year thingy. *Just try to understand me, I know it's harder than it looks* What crappy use of the English language, I'm ashamed *we all are* Any way, back the point that   I actually had ! *had?* A very small one, trust me. Me and Izzy welcome the millennieumemememe *yaargh* I'll be back in a sec...Millennium with "Yaaargh nooo dududumdumdum." Cool huh. So, in 50 years when the worlds ended and we're all bits of floating anti-matter *does anti-matter float? does any one care?* I can say that I did that... yeah... Well I told you it was a small point! *why do I bother* Apparantly, according to Izzy I'm the 'random generator' so I guess I'm just living up to whatever it is I'm supposed to be living up to. *yes, i'm truely this weird most of the time*
