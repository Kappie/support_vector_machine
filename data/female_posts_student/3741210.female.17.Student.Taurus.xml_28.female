They had some good food but everyone had to share stories and they picked me and I didn't really have anything to say but they made me go anyway.  I like it better when people can just speak when and if they feel they should, not because they're forced to.  The trip itself was amazing though and I wish they had more.    Our house is in disarray with all the work going on.  My room doesn't have a door, which is very unsettling and they're painting the trim of my windows so the blinds had to come down and they're laying across my bedroom.  My room is my sanctuary and I hate that I can't go up there and relax.  On the flip side, they installed a make-up table in my closet, so now I have room for a desk.  I feel like its a waste though because I'll be moving in just a year.   I want a car.  All of my friends have at least a car at their disposal (even if they refuse to drive them ahem*Catie*cough.) I don't care if I sound like a whinny kid, I'm 17 and I have an excuse. ITS NOT FAIR.   And don't you   dare   tell me that life is not fair.  Even if its true, I refuse to live in such a reality.  God, look at me.  I'm whining about not having a car when just a month ago I saw people who didn't have running water in their homes, who had trash piled waste high in their front yards, who lived in poverty I still can't even imagine.  And I don't have a car.  Poor, poor me.  Well on a happier note lion king 1 and a 1/2 is on.  Must be going
