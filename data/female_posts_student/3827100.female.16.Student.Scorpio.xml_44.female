You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You  prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide.  Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with.  You may explode.       urlLink http://hokev.brinkster.net/quiz/default.asp?quiz=Better+Personalitypage=1   highly entertaining.. and that is me. like fucking exactly.. i advise if you read it, that you go take it. and tell me what you got. por favor
