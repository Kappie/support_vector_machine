I really have a craving for that game now. lol. Yep. Hung out with Jesse today. Neato.  I'm going to the stampede parade tomorrow. Ugh. In the morninnnnnng!!! VERY MORNING!! AHHHH >. Today Ashley sent me this site, lmao.. This game. I suck at it!! Its like they know where you put the pot noodle soup thing!!! E-gad!!  I'm majorly thirsty right now [2:31 A.M.], I'm also very very cold. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I wish it was sunny and warm and humid. If its not going to be like that in August then, GO UNDER A ROCK AND DIE CALGARY!!!! GRRRRRR
