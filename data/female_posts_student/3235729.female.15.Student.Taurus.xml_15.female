Guys, friends, ex-friends, school. One moment things are going good the next it's like it can't get worse. Yesterday was by far one of the worst days I have had in the longest time,  months . And, about that, well, long story short, I got in a kickass fight with my mom, went into her room and kicked a hole in her door. Semi-unintentionally. I don't remember if I wanted to kick a hole in it. I'm guessing not, though, because of my dad. And then afterwards, after I had realized what I had done and after it had sunk in, I was fucking tripping out. I knew I was in shit. This reminded me of one day back in June, when I knew I was in shit, and I couldn't talk my way out of it. Lindsay knows, and God knows that half my school knows as well. Shit gets around fast...Anyways after I realized what I had done, I escaped my mother by camping over at Autumn's place. One of the roughest nights of my life.  [By the way, my punishments so far include: not being able to go to Distillers (although I think I can talk my way around that one), paying for the door (even though my dad gave me allowance today...), 2 weeks grounding, and getting nothing but a cell phone for my birthday (I have no doubt that that isn't going to happen!) So basically, the only thing that's 100% offical at this present time is the grounding.]    And then today I come home after Driver training and my mom's like "You know, you should've thought before you acted out on your rage and kicked a hole in my door. Then you wouldn't be in so much trouble" I can't remember what I said to that, but it's kinda hard not to when your ready to kill someone. I mean, it took enough will power not to rip the fucker off its hinges and hurl it at her head!   Driver training makes me mad. The instructor is  such  a lackey. Okay, he's taking attendance at the END of class (for some reason...) and he calls my name, I look at him and I'm like "...I'm here" and he's like "Come here for a second." So I go up there, and I'm standing there for at least 5 minutes while he's talking to some other person, and I was like "...So, did you call me up here for a reason?" and he's like "Oh yeah...my daughter knows you." I just give him this weird look and I'm like "Ok...well who's your daughter?" "Megan" "Megan...?" "From McClurg." I was like "O...k..." and I walked away. Now, either I have  no  idea who this Megan creature is, or I do, but it's too far back for me to remember her. I think I have a faint idea, but to confirm it would involve me conversing with specified people, and I don't have the energy right now, and I don't really care. Also, the fact that she remembered me (whoever she is) is slightly creepy. Because, if there's one thing i  do  remember about a Megan, is that I was never really good friends with them.  At lunch today we were all sitting in the cubby, and Brian and Kyle come along. I talked to both of them a little bit, then I started playing with my lighter. So Brian took his lighter out. Then somehow (don't ask me how) me and Ashley decided that Kyle's a penguin. And me and Brian (joking) decided to set him on fire (It's a long story, but basically we set penguins on fire because every day that goes by a penguin doesn't burn, a rubber ducky does...that, and they're the devil.) So Brian and my are lighting the frills of his jeans on fire. Harmless, little fires. Well, he didn't take too kindly to that. Anyways, he spazzes on Brian and he turns his back to him. So Brian holds the lighter to his jacket for maybe, 2 seconds. Kyle pulled fucking drama queen and spazzed on ME because he thought I did it. Anywho, so he storms off and me and Brian decide to have a lighter fight. Lighter fights are ridiculously fun, and apparently fun to watch. It was hilarious. Long story short...I win! And on that note, I bid you adieu.   -Joebie
