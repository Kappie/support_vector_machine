I've been setting up meetings, trying to get approval, working on grants, etc. But, at the same time, I haven't actually started working. New issues keep popping up and I have to work with my mentor/supervisor to resolve them. Who knew that there were so many things to keep track of?!  Hopefully, everything will get resolved and I can start working. I've been really pumped about getting started and actually doing this research. I have two grants lined up ($$$$) and I'd hate to have to decline them, because of unforseen circumstances. But, really, it wouldn't be that bad if I had to turn down the grants. All I want to do is get some clinical research experiences, work with my mentor/supervisor, and actually do something productive/interesting this summer.  I'm going to call my parents tonight to ask for advice. It's really frustrating that things have gotten so complicated. Hopefully, they'll be able to set me straight. I was really counting on the grants, so I could take some of the financial load (even if it was just a small portion of it) off my parents. They've been totally kick ass about paying for my medical education and being my ATM while I'm in medical school. We'll see what happens. Things always go from sucky to better to another kind of sucky and then to another kind of better.
