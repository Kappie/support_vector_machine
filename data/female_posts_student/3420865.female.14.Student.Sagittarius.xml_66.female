"do you want my laptop?"-dad   "...umm...are you sure?"-me   "yeah. do you want it?"-dad   "umm yes...but what are you gonna have?"-me   "oh, i'll figure something out."-dad      wow. that was wierd...sweet.      well that's all.      and your heels look so beautiful against the carpet...   so graceful, yet so insecure.      kayte.
