Got my shoes, handbag, necklace, earrings, hair accessories, and strapless bra (can't forget that!).  I'm excited about prom. It should be fun. After shopping, I called up Alex so we could "investigate" this field between our houses.  We just decided to walk and meet up with each other. So we did that, and then we decided to walk to Amanda's house and wait for her until she got back from work. Well, we had a lot of time to kill, so we walked all around Big Meadow waiting for Amanda. Amanda got home and so me and Alex hung out with her for a bit inside her room. Then we decided to walk some more. We went to my house so I could show them the rest of the things I got for prom. Then we walked back to Amanda's house, and from there Amanda drove me and Alex home. Yeah, didn't really make much sense, but it was still fun. Anyways...for a good portion of the day I noticed myself thinking about a certain person. It's pretty weird, because I dont even know why I'm thinking about this person. It kind of confuses me, but oh well. Hopefully it's just a phase and will pass on along soon enough. I dont like not knowing why I'm thinking of people. It kinda messes with me. Well, that was pretty much my day. Adios!
