C-dub and I (the doctor) went bowling and i tried to be cool and do the ally cat strike thing where the girl spins the ball, but it fails and goes really slowly down the gutterlane.  Well before it gets there I roll another ball and the first one stops because it is going so slow, then this really old guys comes out and he is really angry and says "If you hadn't been screwing around, it wouldn't have gotten stuck."  so that is that story.
