You see I went to Emily's house around one and from there we walked in a downpour to the Mayberry Public Library. Fun place that place, all those books. I was in heaven, as you can imagine.I thought about you, and how I was hoping to see you walk through those doors. I'm dying to get just one more glimpse of you. Emily and I then rented Queen of the Damned and ran back to her house before the rain started again. We stayed there for as long as it took our pants and socks to dry in the dryer and then we walked to McDonald's for dinner. I was hoping to see you there too but no such luck. Well, it started to pour and we got stranded in Micky D's for a while before calling Al and getting her to pick us up. Then we went back to Em's house and screwed around (not like that. I know you would enjoy that too much.) until Al and B.M. got there. Then we just did girl stuff, watched Goldmember and danced around crazily to music. And as I sat there I realized just how much I didn't want to be there with them but with you. I love my friends but sometimes I just want you. We're talking about getting Em's party room set up and having a few parties. I want you to come to some of them, I want to show you my idea of partying and having fun and being myself. I want to spend as much with you as I can before you leave. I guess this is my way you telling you things I can't and hoping that you're missing me just as much as I miss you. The weather reflects my mood, forlorn, soaking wet with emotion that can't be reciprocated until I see your face. I just wish that the days would go faster and the nights wouldn't drag on forever so I wouldn't drive myself insane. So for now I'll just sleep and dream and hopefully that will get me through.
