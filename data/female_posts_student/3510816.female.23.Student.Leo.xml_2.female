I was apartment hunting this weekend and I drive into this place and my first thought was, "Wow, this really doesn't look like the ad. I hope my car doesn't break down." So, I park and find the place they claim is an office. It's actually an apartment. I felt like I was walking into someone's home. The first thing I noticed was the smell. Then I saw two people sitting at a table in the kitchen. I said, "Hi! I'm looking for the leasing agent." They're both like, "Uh, I think he's upstairs." So, I start up the stairs repeating my call of, "Hello...Looking for the leasing agent." I'm sure I sounded a bit trepidacious. Then a voice calls down, "Yeah, yeah...I'll be down in a minute. Have a seat." So, I go sit on a smelly couch in the smelly living room to wait. Then, I start hearing noises. At first I'm like "Cat? Baby? Hmmmm...What's that sound?" Then, the moaning began. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not exactly prudish or anything, but you just don't screw someone (loudly I might add) in your office, during business hours, when there are THREE people sitting not 50 feet down the stairs. On top of the sketchy neighborhood and the smell, there was no way in the hell I was moving into that complex. I got up, smiled at the other two people, and walked out the door. When I got back to the car, I marked off that complex, any complex owned by the same company, and the two adjacent properties for good measure. Then, I went and comforted myself with some Key Lime Pie Ice Cream at Bruster's.   Fin...
