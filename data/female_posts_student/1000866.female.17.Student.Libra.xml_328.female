We got some drill, and went to the first set and then...I think they gave up. Haha. I understood how they wrote it perfectly, but they said they were going to re-write it. I hung out with Emily some which was awesome. She's really funny. I'm excited to get to spend more time with her during band camp.   Hmmm, what else? Oh, they say we need to be packed and bring our luggage by Friday afternoon. Seriously, I was just like...WHAT?!?! I, with my procrastinator mentality was going to pack Saturday morning. Guess not anymore...  So, ok...I'm NOT ready for registration. I just realized I need a picture form, at least to give them for my ID. Great. I threw that form out because I didn't get the registration packet until after that and I didn't KNOW I'd need it. Grrrr. Oh well. I wish I didn't need an I.D. I wish I could just stay out of all pictures. :) What a wonderful world it truly would be. Gosh, I keep hearing this song, "Paved Paradise and put up a parking lot," and now it's in my head. Ahhhhh. Gooooo awayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.   Don't it always seem to go That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone? They paved paradise And put up a parkin' lot...  Argh.  Ah well. Hmmm. I was thinking after a friend of mine mentioned this, it would be so much easier if everything was like math. Just one answer. Not as much fun, but it certainly would be nice if some things were like math with only one answer. Less confusing.   Hmmm, I think I need to get me one of those mouthpieces like Peter has so I can play really high too. Bobby? Is that what they called it? I'm not sure. Ah well, maybe I'll ask Peter. Ahhh, that reminds me. I get to see Chris soon too!!! I'm excited. I've missed having him to just call whenever and complain. He's good at listening to me complain. :)   I have no idea what to bring to band camp...seriously. I don't know whether to bring shorts or pants, long sleeves or short sleeves, which tennis shoes?? So many decisions.   Hmmm, on the way home with Diane and Elizabeth we were talking about Great America. I haven't been there yet this summer. So, I'm hoping maybe I can get a chance to go with Diane, and hopefully some other people too. That would be excellent. I think I need to go to sleep considering I have to wake up at a reasonable hour tomorrow. Noooo, make it end. No school. This hasn't been my best summer yet, but it's definitely been the fastest. Seriously, I thought in the middle of summer that I had a lot of time left and now...wow. And band camp is taking away my last moments of freedom pretty much.   OK, really, I'm going to sleep. I left my book in Diane's car. :( That makes me sad. Oh well. Good night, good night...
