Cath shared this with us in a post*!!!  I have noticed that VERY few *long-term post-ops* post here - my belief is that they are either:  1) out enjoying their NEW life 2) backsliding  embarrassed to come here for support 3) believe that they don't need on-going  long-term support (WRONG!)  Last week at my surgeon's support meeting, I sat with another 2-year-post-op. We discussed where we are at this juncture of our *journey*.  -We can eat WAY more than we used to... (pouch has stretched) -We can eat WAY more things than we could as new post-ops... (things don't make us queasy like they did @ first) -It's very easy NOT to exercise (no sense of urgency to do the RIGHT things)  Here is where *reality* sets in.  The habits that we form during the *honeymoon* period (1st 6 months post-op) will dictate our success long-term.  IF we start eating bad  complex carbs early on... IF we don't exercise... IF we choose the wrong foods... We will struggle to maintain our weight loss long term.  And don't forget.... Carbs turn to sugar, sugar turns to fat. Period.  Our surgery is ONLY a tool to allow us to rid ourselves quickly of the excess weight we have gained over a lifetime  to start over *fresh*.  It will NOT allow us to keep that weight off by *pure magic*.  Our goal is to NEVER diet again...  Our goal should be to find the foods that we enjoy (protein FIRST)  incorporate those foods into our new *lifestyle*.  *Stress* eating does not go away magically with this surgery.  These past 3 months have been very stressful for me  I find myself back to old habits of grazing  eating just because it's there.  This is extremely distructive behavior and we MUST recognize it and control it before it controls us (again).  Foods that I enjoyed pre-op are starting to sound GOOD to me again (Sonic chili-dogs, hamburgers, etc). It takes a concerted effort for me to pass a Sonic and NOT pull in. It's not easy.  This post is NOT to in any way diminish the enthusiasm that I see here daily on the board, but to make sure each  every person on this journey knows that we MUST pay due-diligence to a new *lifestyle* to maintain our weight loss.
