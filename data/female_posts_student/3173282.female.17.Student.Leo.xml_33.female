I was watching it again last night with my dad, and i noticed a scene that i had never seen before. But i jsut thought i had missed it when i first watched it. THEN at the end, he like fuckin kills himself and i was like "What?! that's not the ending i saw!" I was so freaked out but then my dad told me we watched the director's cut and i felt stupid. But i like the other ending better, the one me n J watched. Not as depressing, yo! All i've been doin today is eating my house. And i looked at a few colleges in Boston, since that is the most "wicked-pissa-cool" city in the world. I dunno, its somethin they say in boston.... !Anyway! Boston University looks good to me, and a major in photojournalism or film. I kinda really wanna make a movie to one of my favorite books. Actually it would be a trilogy but no one has done it yet and hopefully they won't so i can do it! Anywhoo, i was just lookin at boston in case my flight career doesn't end up working out. It needs to be sunny again. I.WANT.MY.SUMMER.BACK. these days are just grey and blaaaaah! Last night was a bad ngiht for my family. Everyone was unhappy, except for me really. But its just, no one wants the same things and its shitty for my parents. I'm going back, they want to go back, but my sister wants to stay here like a cock-ass. I dunno i feel bad sometimes. Shouldn't families stick together? But i'm leaving them...i just dont know if its right. But i really want to. Well i hope you had a fun day anyway. Later yooos.
