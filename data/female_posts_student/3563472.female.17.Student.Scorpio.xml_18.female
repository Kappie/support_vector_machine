The funny thing about irony in books and movies is that the writer specifically sets a situation up to be ironic. Which kind of makes the situation not Ironic. Now an it is ironic that premeditated irony isn't really ironic at all.  I read a column by David brooks. It really touched base with a lot of things that are going to affect the upcoming elections and other things in the future of our country/gov. It basically talked about how people choose parties and then form their ideas afterwards and once people find a party they don't switch. The American People no longer evaluate both candidates and see who they think is best for our country's future. Voters almost always vote within their party.
