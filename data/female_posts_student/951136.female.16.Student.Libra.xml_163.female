That life goes on even when my eyes are closed. B.c. they have been closed for way too long. reality is a word in a dictionary.  And my life right now is just a matter of cutting off the sides of my life and fitting myself into temporary molds. I have to be something. I have to do things. I have to say things. I have some form of myself that has to come out at each moment of the day. I have to tell myself that everything is going to be ok. But i can't think about it, or else i panic and lose control of everything. I dont know if it will all be ok. And if it isn't, then i'm not prepared. I dont know what all these ppl want from me. I dont know what i want. And when that starts to slip it all goes. i was starting to find out what i wanted. But at the first try i slip on ice. My life feels empty. I'm grasping for anything nailed to the floor.  i miss you.  i dont understand anything anymore. I've just stopped thinking about it all, Ive stopped asking the fucking questions that drive us mad. but i still miss it. something. I just stiffle it with another thought, and it goes somewhere else for a while. i want to cry but i can't. There is nothing in front of me to cry over. i just want to see you.
