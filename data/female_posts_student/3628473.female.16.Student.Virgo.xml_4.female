No huge changes happends, no one got saved and fell to the ground crying cause some kids were cleaning... But it was a blessing... I liked "kickin" in with "homies".My mind was on alot of things today, mostly sleep and how much i wanted to be in my bed. But also a boy... :0... I think i'm meant to live a life with out dating... No men, no boys, no anything like that. I always feel like i'm putting God last. Or i shouldn't be dating cause i love my God... But thats not it... Right?i can't ask people what they think cause they will say "Do what you feel is right"... What i feel is right?! Well i'm feeling to different things... Kind of sucks... yea...
