And a whole new journey begun.    I still remember the day I first stepped into NJC. It was some STAR programme introduction thing. I was somewhat excited and anxious about how the 2 years in NJ will turn out to be.    The first time I stepped into the range- felt foreign, overwhelmed andvery interested.  My first targetcard- 2 out of 5 shotson the card (hahahahahhaha I must have been really bad!)    My first group of new friends(in my 1st class)- a few people from 03s19    My new class- the ever nutty and supposedly the 'Normal Tech' of NJC (I bet all of you remember who said that :p)...03S17 hahahaha    My first common test results- B B CD (oh boy that sounds great compared to what I have been getting lately hahahahaha)    My first..my first..my first...    And after almost2 memorble years in NJC... 'my firsts' are now changing to 'my lasts'    My last shoot in NJC- Nationals (we got gold! yay! :) )      Its amazing how time flies..and very soon we will start yet another new journey...
