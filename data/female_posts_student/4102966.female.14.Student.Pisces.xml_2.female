The bloody guy was such a suck. He was totally flirting/ sucking up to a girl off the other team just 'coz her dad is like his teacher or something. So rude. And they started AGREEING with us. AND one girl just read off her cards and didn't even look up. The worst thing is that I totally prepared and everything and i got the same points as an under-prepared team. Ripped off to the max. Anyway, I wasn't as nervous as last time. Thanx Mrs Hicks. Yeah so anyway, I haven't been on MSN in 2 days. Wow. I'm in IT, this is so boring. That works on 2 levels. THIS is boring and so is IT. Yeah I'm sorry this is boring, you really don't have to read it. That reminds me, I haven't written in my actual diary for a while... Kimo.
