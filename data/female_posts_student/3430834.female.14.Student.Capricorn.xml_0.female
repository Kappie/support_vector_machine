When we go into Guess, we see this 65 year old lady with gray hair wearing...whats that? a black MINI SKIRT and a white OFF THE SHOULDER V-NECK SHIRT EXPOSING HER SAGGY CLEAVAGE? yes...and then she comes up to me and asks me where i got my shirt because thats "EXACTLY!" what shes looking for...then the lady working at Guess wont show her some of the shirts available because some of the logos are too "weird" for the lady to wear...maybe she just is trying to help you avoid some embarassment? Then we shop for a little more and go to Starbucks, where this probably college guy working there makes a sad attempt to flirt with us.  He kept cracking stupid jokes like telling us the totaly was $5.44 and then when we would hand over the money, he would be like "its 10.44"...um funny? i dont think so, and the best part was him offering me anything of my choice "on him" bc i didnt buy that much? and of course the fat ladys purple underwear sticking out of her pants...at least i got some tank tops and the purse mel gave me money to buy for her...never knew we had such freaks in Westport!! g2g do some of my english essay and finish up packing, cya tomorrow on my last day of school before going to the bahamassss (in case u DIDNT know)  :P
