I was happy to see them go, but also sad not to see them again. Ah well. We had fun though. As much trouble as they were, they were worth it, in my opinion.  On a lighter note, I got my liscence today. I know I didn't spell that correctly, so you will have to deal with it. Actually, when I went to get gas with my mom, we saw, and talked to, Uncle Stan! So yeah. It was kinda funny.  Saw Troy. I really kinda didn't like it. Ah well. To each their own.  I can't wait for Ocean's 12 and the Bourne Supremency to come out. :-D I liked the first two movies, and I am really looking foward to the next two! yay! Ah well.  Quote of the day time!!! Today's quote: Acta est fabula. Have fun. Latest points, I believe: Alison: 900 Michael: 520 Sarah: 470 Olivia: 460 Nathan: 350 Jonah:320 Evan and Marten: 160  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"
