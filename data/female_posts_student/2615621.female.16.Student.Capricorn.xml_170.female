I wanted to hear about the stuff she did and everything.   I'm so ready to come home.   Clement started talkin to me again today..dude i havent talked to him in like a year...wow hes being nice to me...lol We're gonna get drunk together. woo hoo! lol too bad all my friends will be gone...i need a buddy. lol he wants katie to come, just so he can tell "faggot andrew i got his girl drunk" umm..ok. whatever clement. He all the sudden pops up and says "julia.." and im like..whoa clement, hes actually talkin to me! so i said "hey..dude why u talkin to me?" lol he told me he was bored and then asked how i had been. we've both changed a lot, hes goin a lil less on the drugs and im going a little more on em. not really hardcore drugs..but u know..lol and we catch up a lil bit and he tells me hes proud and all this stuff haha all the sudden i got happy cuz i dunno..i used to have a crush on him and all this stuff. i really liked him. and for some reason he got mad at me or something, and we stopped talking..for a year. i deleted him and was like "fuck that" and havent thought about him since. Now he wants to hang out and get drunk. he just told me bye, but was sure to tell me hes not forgetting what we're gonna do. yea yea...maybe im cool enough for him now. lol bullshit he prob heard i was doin that stuff now instead of the sweet lil innocent "naw..i dont drink" bullshit that will ruin ur life!  DONT EVER TELL PEOPLE UR NOT INTO THAT SHIT!! IT RUINS UR LIFE.. hahaha well at least i broke outta that. lol anyways, i was worried that id have to see him at sarahs when i got home and he'd be a dick or something, but now he wants to hang out without sarah cuz shes "grody" lol gotta love that word. anyways, i all the sudden became happy when i talked to him, maybe it was the feelings left over from a year ago.   he has his license now. he wrecked his grandmas car yesterday. lol stupid dumb fuck. he gave me the whole story behind him stealing a car and totaling it. lol sarah gave me a fucked up verison. He didnt steal it, he just took it for a ride. haha I'm glad i got to talk to him actually...  Katie told clement shes been drunk before..she didnt mention it was off a bottle of wine. *rolls eyes* she totally blew it up and he asked me about it. haha  Everything you thought was fine has turned its back into time...  *much love and time bombs*
