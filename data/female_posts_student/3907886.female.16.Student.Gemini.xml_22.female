Finally, I though that alittle relif was coming the next weekend, but it was only then did I realize that I had off so  I could do an overnight babysitting thing.  I suppose that if we had to look at this in a good way, one would come up with the conclution that I'd be making alot of money, and I would finally be able to afford a computer or something.  But the more I think about it, the less I really want a computer.  I mean, why waste my money on something like that.  It doesn't really make all that much sense, because I have a perfectly good computer right here.  After I stoped downloading music and shit from online, this computer's been completely virus free!  And what's even better is that I have my own account so that means that I can make my desktop look like whatever I want.  Right now, I have this really cool spacey bubbles theme, it rocks.   Well, enough talk about computers.  So if my paycheck this Wed is only gonna be like $70 cause I was out of town, that's ok I guess.  I just won't put anything into savings this time.  I'll just start to pay my mum back.  I owe her like $100.  It sucks being in debt.  Oh well.  I'll get out of it eventually.  I also don't like being on the other end either, like with this one friend, he owes me $70.  I just wish that I could clear it up, and worry about something else.  I mean, what's money anyways.  A peice of green paper that smells really bad?!?!?!  Hey, have you ever actually smelt money?  I mean, really put it right up to your nose and smelt it?  Wow does that stuff wreak!!!  Gross.  Son next paycheck, the one in two days is gonna be kinda small.  Well, not kinda small, but really stinking itty bitty small.  But that' ok, because in two weeks from now, it's gonna be huge!!!  Working every day for 2 weeks!  Wow.  I'm gonna go count up my hours right now.   50 hours!  50 hours times $6 per hour is  $300!!!!!  Wowwie that's alot of money.  It'll be enough to pay back my mom, put some in my bank account, plus still have spending money!!!  How hot is that.  I'm excited now.  I guess that working does have it's perks.  I love my job though.  I mean, like tonight for example, I get done at 10:45, and I went to Taco Bell with Gina, Melanie, and Kristin.  We all got to eat some really good food, and sat there and just talked for about an hour.  I got home at midnight, and luckily my mom wasn't home.  She's out of town at some buisness thing.  But my dad was home, and he never really cares about anything.  As long as I don't do anything stupid, he could care less.  I think he did mention somethin about calling him, but who knows, and who really cares.  Maybe I should start to care alittle more, because if I keep not showing up when I'm supposed to, they're not gonna let me go out when ever I want to.  Speaking of going out, Rachel's mom came in today, because Rachel was supposed to work, but she ended up trading with Melanie, so Rachel we all just assumed, went home.  But when her mom came in and asked where she was, we were all just like, umm...  Boy was her mom mad that Rachel didn't call.  But I don't even think that it crossed Rachel's mind to, because she was gonna be out of the house anyways, what difference does it make where she is.  She's lucky though, cause her mom's really cool, and really loose about the rules.  I mean, she doesn't even have a curfue.  I'm jelous.  Usally I'm supposed to be home by 11.  10 on a weeknight.  I think that durring the school year, it's gonna be 11 on the weekends, and 9 on a school night, if that even.  But so will lots of other ppls, and I don't wanna be totally dead for school the next day.  As long as we're talking about being dead, or I guess I'm writing about it, I don't wanna wake up so late tomarrow, cause I have regestration for school.  So I'm gonna hit the sack.    Later  ~Ani
