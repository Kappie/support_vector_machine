( western washington residents are familiar with this landmark ) there are very few times that i stop and admire the beauty of the seattle skyline, but when i do, there is a sense of awe that comes over me. the city is gorgeous. it is a major metropolitan yet there is a pleasant mixture of nature-- the waters of lake union, bridges that float on the waters of lake washington, trees and homes on queen anne hill. there is a contrast between the "eastside" and "westside" (referring to which side of lake washington you live in. i live and prefer the eastside, but that's one girl's opinion)... but like all things in life.... there is a yin and yang--both its main purpose, to bring balance.   comparing new york and seattle would be like comparing apples and oranges, but since new york is the big apple, i prefer the orange of seattle's sunsets. maybe it's just me who holds such preference ( my friend lester prefers the women of new york, but that's lester. hehe ) , but i've lived the fast paced life before. i grew up in southern california where the pace is as fast as the cars that drive on the freeway.   in metropolitans like ny and la, it is easier to get caught in the moment and maybe get caught doing something you wish you hadn't done. i also found it easier to lose yourself. though i still haven't truly come into my own yet, it seems more acceptable here in seattle. people are quicker to accept you just the way you are, without much judgement in how the layer of your clothes look on you. it's acceptable that you enter a beautiful restaurant like The Met, in jeans and a t-shirt--suppose they only care that you can pay the bill.   i expect that i won't be living here for my entire life. there is some part of me that wants to experience the other cultures of america and the world. but i'd have to say, if someone asks me where home is, seattle will always be my one true home.
