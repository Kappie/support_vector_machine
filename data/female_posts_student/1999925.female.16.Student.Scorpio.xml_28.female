I often wishes that I could have the summer back. Those were good times ^^ Haha~ Always having parties and playing DDR ^_^ Also, there is always the times when I didn't sleep until early morning ~ 5 am, 6am and sometimes 7 am ! Hard to believe that this was my everyday routine practically. My day was usually one of these 2 things :   1) - has gone to bed at 6 am so wakes up at 2 pm     - does " morning " routine  ( washing, eating, dressing and so on )      - calls friends to make planes for the day (if not have spent the night from tiredness of the previous night)     - checks e-mail and chats untill friends arrive (if friends have splet over then rest untill other friends arrive)     - when friends arrive cook for them XD or give them something to eat ( I am usually like a cook or chef for them ^^' ) * gets frying pan out * " food anyone ? "      - Play DDR !!! (Top thing to do ! You can get fit and have fun at the same time XDDD)      - Dinner~      -  After dinner is usually to go out and cause trouble ?! " I'm a good girl .. maybe ^.^' "      - When the sun goes down ... P-A-R-T-Y !!!! *gets strobe light and glow sticks out*      - Sleep _o_ zZzZzZzZzZzZz ...   2) - goes to bed about 6 am and wakes up at 10 am ! ( O_O I need more sleep ~ )      - gets ready for the day ( same as #1)      - checks mail and chats to family, friends and others     - calls friends to make plans for after dinner ( Seems as though "taking it is easy" is important for these kind of days )      - Dinner ~      - after dinner go out to friend but doesn't " P-A-R-T-Y " ( Seems everyone is a bit tired today )      - go home about 2 am to check mail before resting      - chat to friends and others      - sleep ...   But now it makes me sad a bit.. wanting the Summer and 我的夏天希望 .  But then again, Christmas is comming soon. 23 more days I believe...Thinking of Christmas makes me always want to go iceskating. Going with my friends is fun and an option, but I would really want to go with my " dream guy " . Remembering parts in Manga and so on makes me want this even more ! 多么浪漫!  *blushes* If I do fall (which I usually don't) he will bend down and offer me his hand *laughs* When he does help me up maybe I will push him then ~ Haha! Am I really this crule ? " If you push me I will push you back..."  Now I want to go to Downtown! ^ ^ Everytime at Christmas they put Christmas lights in the trees ^_^ It's a nice view and enjoyable to walk there. Even more enjoyable with my " dream guy " ~ Maybe he will think it is quite chilly weather since he is from another part of the world.. even to chilly to walk in the city streets (more if it snows~)  Hey ! I know he loves the snow so he won't mind if it does. Yet again it's my chance to snuggle him. A kiss should surely warm us. Just hope he won't burn up ~ ohoho ^o^ For some reason I can see how he would dress for this weather...*giggles* It's so cute! *wishes he was here to hug and never let go* And seems he is always wearing some kind of baggy pants which is a great match for his large/ baggy shirt. Don't know about the jacket though .. never seen him wear a winter jacket. I will have to ask him.  Gosh.. all these thoughts are silly to some people. I just hope I can have these experiences with him one day~  我非常想念他   Well I will go now .. so see ya ^^/" - alei  (song) *Love* by : Escaflowne  If you find a way to love Can you see and stay to love        In a sign called countlessness       Sketch the keys to you       Reaching for a post       Where one loves the most        As we learn in different ways       Free so dreams come true       Searching for a style       Care without denial        What we say despite of love       Collide into self-retreat       Can't we see that love can be       Something so precious       To cherish and hold and then  In so many ways to love If we realize its love In so many ways to love If we realize its love         If you see ignite in love       So far to reach above       Can't you see that love can be       Something so precious       To cherish and hold and then       (...something so precious       to cherish and hold and then)  All so many ways of love Can we compromise true love It's those funny things in love In our only way we love      * Our love so precious       True love is to cherish       Our love so precious       True love is to cherish      * repeat
