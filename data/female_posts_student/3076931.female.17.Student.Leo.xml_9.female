I dunno it just upsets me that NO ONE really knows me except for a few people like my mom.  And i know that it's my fault. There are so many things people don't know about me.  I write. I love writing..(haha my writing skills may not be all that great in here..but i do write other thoughts somewhere else, believe me) i also have realized that i actually do have somewhat of a passion for the yearbook.  Just working on designing my own yearbook made me realize how important to me that class is. I really enjoy what i do.   I guess no one would guess that i'm an insightful person (or at least i think i am). I actually do THINK about things. I'm not stupid. I don't know why i suddenly started thinking about this.  I've been thinking a lot about things like this the past few months.  Maybe it's because i had somewhat of a "revelation" recently.  That may sound cheesy, but honestly i think that was what it was.  bah reading that makes me laugh. oh well ANYWAYS... so i had this "revelation" and i started thinking a lot more about things.  Just certain things.  Things that i'm going to keep private for myself.  I'm really glad though that i started thinking about all these things, because it helped me figuire out who i am.  I am just now figuiring out who i am.  I don't care what anyone thinks anymore.  I am so sick of pleasing other people.  Yeah it's my fault that no one really knows who i am, yeah its my fault people think i'm shallow..but i guess it's good that i know that i'm not.  Maybe that is all that matters.  That is all that matters.  i know that the ONLY people who REALLY care about me in this world are my parents and  my brother.  They    are the people who will be there until the end. They are the only people that truly, honestly matter to me right now.  They are the only ones who know me and the only ones who will ever know me.   I guess i'm just really upset that it took me so long to figuire that out.  I spent too much time with others who don't give a shit about me and ignored the people who really do care.  And i feel awful for  doing that.   WoW.   Night.
