I have to go back to "work" tomorrow. Lol, I don't do anything, but I get paid for it. Not a bad deal, but its very boring. Oh well. I need the money. Grr. I'm so unbelievably bored. Just sitting here blasting John Mayer. Fun stuff. Paul came over last night. This is pretty much how we spent the entire night.     Me: "I'm bored. Let's do something."    Paul: "Ok, what do you want to do?"    Me: "I don't know. What do you want to do?"    Paul: "I don't know."    Lol. We had this conversation like 15 times. But weactually did find the cure for hiccups. Don't ask. Yeah...so. Catchstone concert on Friday. I'm super excited. They have a 2 hour set. Its going to be one big party :-). Yay. And thats pretty much it. I'm done now, lol.
