I didn't have that much to do being my first day and all, but the bonding I had with the girls was so worth the down time. I've also bonded with another acquaintance of mine. She's a very unique child of the universe. An ultimate straight shooter. That's what I looooove about the people I choose to be around.  I've forgotten to tell you about a few interesting occurrences besides the ones already mentioned in other journal entries. I had the strangest thing happen to me this weekend. My Mother cooked lunch Sunday and while my Father and I were relaxing on the front porch talking about going up and clearing the trail, our cat of 3 years, Agnes, came up on the front porch in our amazement and jumped right up into my lap, laid down, snuggled against my stomach and let me stroke her beautiful persian fur!! This cat hasn't let anyone touch her in 3 years!! and here she was in my lap!! My Mother calls us in for lunch, while Dad and I sat there quietly talking he mentions we need to go in and before either one of us could move, upon him saying that Agnes jumps down and mosies on her way, like she was responding to what Dad had said. Very peculiar.  I also ran into an old friend of mine last week and he invited me to a seminar that he and his wife do here in town. The registration is 50 dollars and they let me sit in on it for free. It was an awesome seminar on the "family structure of the new age" talking about blended families. They did an extraordinary job! I promised them we'd all get together for coffee sometime, even though I don't do the coffee thing...  How about that storm tonight? I could feel it coming. It revived my energy. I was so tired when I got home today and had so much left to do. I was almost ready to give up on it all when the lightening reenergized my energy field. I feel really great now and will spend some extra time in meditation tonight visualizing my goals.  I talked with one of my friends about one of my goals tonight. I've invited her to come out to my house and explore with me. It's nice to have someone who has dreams for the future to come out and listen to your dreams as well. For so long, being married to the fellow I was, being discouraged about having dreams, him having no dreams himself and not being allowed to have friends to share with was really a building time for me. I needed to hone in on what is really important to me, to assess what I value most in me and around me.  I value the continuity of my existence in this universe, I value my blessed children, I value my mental preparations, I value physical expressions, I value the landscapes that bring me serenity, I value my dreams of my new home for the future and my new stable with my 2 horses, with my new old truck and horse trailer, and my trip to Thailand and Stonehenge, and I value the lives that I will touch with my heart for it is my eyes. Why shall I look with the possessions of my orbits when we already have the ability to visualize with our hearts all we'll every need to hold in our view? My heart has shown me great and powerful things in recent times. Fortunate I feel. Humble to the manifestations that bring to me wonder. Embracing me tightly with it's strength.  I love you,  BLG  P.S. I haven't told anyone I love them beyond my children's ears in a while now. I don't want it to be lost from my lips. Practice it I must for my voice will never grow weak again and yet my ears grow deaf to it's resonance.
