Let me tell ya, its already been a great day.  My flight was delayed an hour and a half from Columbus, but the time went by fast as I read Jhumpa Lahiri's book "Interpreter of Maladies." I know, I know, I'm the last person to jump on that bandwagon and she's already out with another Pulitzer winning book, "The Namesake." Nevertheless I enjoyed reading  for pleasure  again. I also really like how she addresses the stories of immigrants, expatriates, and first generation Indian-Americans alike. Every story I've read today has had some connection to a personal story in my life. Definitely a must read.  Reading that book got me to the city by 3:30. My uncle picked me up from the airport. Betcha didn't know he's a cab driver! It was nice to catch a cab and pay no fare. It would have been nearly $30 to Long Island City where my old friend Nina lives. Thanks "Belal Mama."  Nina and I have both changed dramatically. I still remember how punk she was in high school, and how traditional conservative I was in college. None of that tonight though. We spent the afternoon catching up, and then went to Union Square in Manhattan. Union Square by the way is just a few blocks from the Empire State Bldg. Armed with our credit cards and a willingness to spend freely, we attacked Virgin Records, Aerosoles (I now own the sexiest pair of black patent stilletos the world has ever seen), Victoria's Secret, Sephora (yay, new makeup!), and Express ($20 off jeans!). We also visited a random street fair where I got a strawberry crepe. I love food vendors. Finally, we met up with Nina's boyf Nathan at this little Thai restaurant in the Village called Spice. Dinner was faaaantabulous.  After that Nina and Nathan and I returned to Nina's pimped out apartment (I swear I've never seen a more sophisticated place to live, that looks so deceivingly ghetto on the outside!). It was time to get sexified!! I totally broke out the new shoes, and Nina and I shared our new makeup. Her other friends Beryl and Ebone came over to go out and we all sat around and talked for a while. Ebone had an incident with a bad bottle of orange Zima while we waited for Nina to get glammed up.  Beryl drove us to Manhattan in his 89 Cadillac Deville. I thought I was going to die in that car, it was soooo scary. I still can't believe I braved and survived New York driving last summer!! Despite the driving madness, we eventually arrived at the club. At 2 AM! In Columbus that would be when last call is made, but uh uh, not in New York! Judging by the attendance at that club, with its 10,000 sq ft dance floor, I was sure that the city really never sleeps!  The club we went to was called Spirit, and it came with an all-night spa built inside! We danced too long to get massages though, they were closed :( . And as you can see by the time, the Red Bull and Diet Coke have not worn off. Beryl and Nathan and Nina and I are all still up. The night is not over yet...;P  More as convenient computer access arises. Shout outs to everyone from the Big Apple!
