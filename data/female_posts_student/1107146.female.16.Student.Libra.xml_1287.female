I'll call you in the morning un case you don't get this in time.  Liz isn't coming to Ren Fest with us anymore.  But I just got home from baby-sitting, and got enough to cover my outfit and maybe my food.  Which is great, because the kids I sat for are  wonderful   Emily is four and Andrew is eight.  Emily fell asleep on my arm why we were watching Lady and the Tramp II (which was actually pretty decent for a sequel) and I had to carry her up to bed, put on her pull-ups and pajama pants.  By that time, I was so tired from trying to get her out of the knot she was creating in the sheets and from trying to move the cat from between her and me, that I just left her shirt on.  I told her parents, and they were like, yeah, they do that a lot.  I was thinking "Clue to an earlier bedtime?" but hey, that's their choice.  Anyway, the reason I actually came on here was to tell yall that it's just Abby, Josh, and me going to Ren Fest tomorrow.  Rosie, I have no idea how to get there because I've always hitched a ride. Call Josh, maybe he'll know.  Good Night, All.  I'm tired.  And Josh, no more posts at 2:00 am.  Go to bed!!!
