So she asks me about the status quo and making new friends, etc. And then we get into discussing nasty letters, bitter gossip, drifting apart.  I still don't know what to make of it. Ryan, Tiff and I used to be so close that everything would just mush together into one vague consciousness. But we were mean to each other too. It was a competition, and I don't know how many times I had to hear that "the group dynamics of three are complicated." I told Ryan and Tiff a slew of things with too much trust. And sometimes we ganged up on each other--it was just the way we were structured. One day I thought ok, this is shit, I'm not going to let them make fun of me like that anymore, no matter how jokingly the letter was written.  Don't get me wrong, I am no drama queen, but I didn't see the point in being "friends" with people who called you rude and arrogant, etc. It was hard, to start with. But I'm satisfied with the way I've restructured, as unfeeling as that may sound.  I'm talking to Charle. again, but not Ryan. I don't think I could ever make it up to him because most directly it was my fault. It's not a nice thing to say, but I don't think it's worth the humility to restore our funny trio and to risk getting hurt again. I usually don't cut people off. But maybe he's an exception. I have too much hidden in him, and I don't to see it out in the open again.  I can't go back, it's a part of growing up. And if I'm so strong now, why would I ever discard that for something less?
