We ran through puddles and splashed everywhere, laughing at each other...bliss for a few moments *sighs*  I really don't know what i need right now. I don't think i've ever felt this bad about myself in my entire life. What is makeing me go crazy? I left school today...and most people were like why did you leave...because i really didnt seem to be in that bad of a mood. Its because first and second period I couldn't focus on anything else but about how trashy i looked and how good everyone else looked. It was just like.... i never want to be seen in public again.   Thinking on it now i dread going bad to school tommorow for those same reasons.   My dad said I can get excused from school today from the doctor I'm going to see on thursday, because clearly I'm mentally unstable #$##^T#@@!!!  The rain stopped.
