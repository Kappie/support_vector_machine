The only reason it's not loud is that I don't want to startle myself at 6:40 am tomorrow morning when I drive to school.  It's so relevant.  I got another email today. A long one, surprise. Tears again, I have to stop being so awfully weak. Well, I didn't expect him to capitulate so soon, he's the man in the conversation. I was going to email him back, "You suck. You weren't supposed to give in, but now that you've screwed up my strategy I'll have to go back and think. More later." He says we've both changed. I believe him, but I'm not ready to start imagining how he's transformed. It's just not right. I was always the one who seemed like I wanted him more, and here he is asking for friendship. What is up with that?   I have to think carefully before I write him back. The last thing I want is to start something again and not know it.
