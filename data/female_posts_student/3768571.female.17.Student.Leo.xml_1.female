Apparently, they don't eat enough fruit and vegetables.  Apparently, the food they eat at school is too high in sugar.  Why do I keep putting the word 'apparently' at the beginning of my sentences? It's all true, isn't it? Yes, yes it is. But i'm just slightly humouring the situation. Who are the ones saying all this? The government...teachers...parents... what do all these people have in common? (Overworked and underpaid? Possibly, but that's not the answer I'm going for.) The thing they all have in common is that they are all ADULTS. The very essence of society.   A child's parents are the main influence on said spawn's life. They are the ones who shape it, mould it into fine human beings. Does it not stand to reason that if the child is introduced to exercise at a young age, and parents make the exercising fun, then the child will grow up to enjoy exercise and will remain fit and healthy.  The parents are also the ones who have the final say on how much television a child is permitted to watch, how much time they spend playing computer games etc. Children have absolutely no sense of common reasoning, so isn't it obvious that it's their parents who should be firm in their discipline and cast the deciding vote on such activities?  Lunchbox-style food is aimed at children, it's packaged in pretty colourful boxes with free toys; the kinds of things kids like. Most of these kinds of foods are extremely high in additives, namely because they're cheaper and easier to mass-produce. BUT if they made the things with proper ingredients, then the kids would be getting better stuff.  Now, the whole food thing just really racks me off, because, quite frankly, who does the shopping?! If the parents didn't buy all the rubbish they seem to be feeding their offspring, then the kids wouldn't eat it! Take me, for instance. My dad buys cereal bars instead of chocolate, extra fruit instead of crisps, cranberry juice instead of fizzy drinks: you catch my drift? If he bought sweets and fatty foods and the such, then that's what I'd eat!   Except I wouldn't, actually, because now i'm old enough to see beyond the pretty colourful package and realise exactly what good food is. I know how to cook, and I can cook for my brother and I, and a whole host of guests if needed, when my dad's at work. I think for kids to learn how to cook would be a great step for the government, then they'd have more scope as to what they can make. (Move over Gordon Ramsey, your time is up.)  I just don't see how all these adults can be so BLIND, when they're the ones to blame. Children have purely hedonistic lifestyles: they don't save for university from the age of 5, they don't think of career plans, they don't compare calorie intake in different foods. If you know a child like this please call me, so I can come and shoot it. Adults just need to guide the youngsters, and then we can let them grow up and be happy, healthy, generally lovely human beings. Or politicians, but methinks that's a story for another day.  Byebye, everybody, byebye.
