He says i dont know, im just looking out for you. Thank you but you dont have to, i mean i care about you alot i just wanna spend time with you while im here and have fun not think about anything.  I really appreciate him worrying about hurtting me no other guy have ever dont that. I love him for that. That makes everything i feel for him that much stronger. I mean i care about him more than i have ever cared about a guy and knowing that he really does care and that he's looking out for me just makes me i dont know. Makes me want him even more.  If i could have one wish...just one it would be a tie between putting my parents back together my family, or to have him for the rest of my life. Its a tought one. I mean i should say put my family back together forever, but i dont know the thought of having him forever...for the rest of my life it the ultimate happiness to me. Never will i be sad, never will i hurt or long.  All day long after talking to sarah this morning, i was just in a funk. Depressed all day becasue i thought he was going to stop talking to me and just blow me completely off and that kills me to think of that ever happening. AGAIN! i wanna be with him entirely and completely. I would change my whole life for him. Thats sad because he wouldnt for me. And he doesnt feel the same exact way as i do..thats okay i cant expect him to. I know he cares about me though alot. But im just more there i guess i dont know its different.  Im soo gratefull for him, im so gratfull for everything he does to me..everything he makes me feel. Gratefull for him careing so much.
