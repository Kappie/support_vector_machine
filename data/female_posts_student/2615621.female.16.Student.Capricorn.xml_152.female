It was no big deal and didnt make me wanna cry...everyone was like "awww julia! uve grown up so much!!" and im thinking "yeah beyatches, u havent seen me since i was 5 or 6 years old!" OF COURSE IVE GROWN UP!! IM FREAKIN 16!! I GREW TALLER AND GOT MY OWN LIFE AND DEVELOPED MY OWN THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS AND I GOT A LIFE!! AND GUESS WHAT..I GOT BOOBS! dumbasses. anyways, the only person who made me feel HALF happy was the groom, my cousin Lance. He actually acted excited to see me. He smiled and hugged me and his now wife was like "ive heard soo much about u julia! im so happy to meet u" she made me feel wanted outta the whole damn bunch. then her mother was like "ooo its julia!! ive heard soo much about you from lance!"...i guess lance talked about me. i dont even remember the dude...but im glad he stood there with open arms. made me feel like family. everything about the wedding was nice...made me think about my wedding one day. ive decided i want a live band, not a sound system.   My cousin Caroline, the only one besides Grant i remember(Grant didnt make it to the wedding, but hes my age and caroline is a year younger), but she wants to spend a few days together before i leave. well thats gotta be this week and i really dont think my aunt and cousin (caroline's mom) will come through with driving the 1 1/2 hours to get me to spend the nite with caroline. i hope they do..it would be fun..but ive gotten my hopes up about a lot of things. Caroline is a softball player and cheerleader...she doesnt strike me as a cheerleader and if u saw her you wouldnt think so either.   *much love and altoids*  IM COMING HOME IN 6 DAYS!! HELLS YEA!! AND LAURENS BACK FROM THE BEACH! YAYS!
