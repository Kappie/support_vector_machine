It's the petite sedan, which fits my personality better than does the 4runner, which almost suggests burly, rough 17-year-old. Put in the Postal Service. I couldn't figure out how to turn the base down, and so I happily watched the side mirrors vibrate to the tunes. First stop: the Bookaneer. On TO Boulevard, not far past the Auto Mall. It took me forever to turn into the little shopping center. I wonder why there are individual stores on TO. It's so busy it's hard to park, and there's no advantage of anchor tenants or anything. But I digress. It just took a while. I watched the boulevard traffic as the Postal Service played on and I bit my tongue hoping passing cars wouldn't crash into me and oh please, would the traffic let up just for a sec?  Ah, and then the Bookaneer. When I first walked in, I saw a bunch of Penguin titles--the ones with orange and white on the spines. That was "Fiction." I guess I can't particularly complain, it's at least a used bookstore somewhere near, but it wasn't much to look at. The selection was all right, but it wasn't anything that I would pick up and buy. I saw Falling Leaves, haha. The lady in the store had glasses, was listening to Bizet, I think (I remember I played it in orchestra, but I don't quite remember what it is) and was doing cross stitching. There was one shelf devoted wholly to Homer's Odyssey and the Iliad, which was amusing and appalling, simultaneously. There's quite a few Shakespeares. Maybe I'll go back in there when I have to find a Hamlet, that has to be common. I picked up King Lear the last time I went used book shopping. If the sections in the store and the respective quantities of books in them accurately represent what the general reading public digests, I'm pretty disappointed. A lot of romance, western, sci-fi. But I guess that's the stuff that sells. I found Fitzgerald! That was the highlight. The Beautiful and the Damned, a posthumously assembled anthology--The Crack Up, and the standard Gatsby and Tender. I couldn't find This Side of Paradise, though, which was disappointing since I would've bought it. I was tempted to get Crack Up until I realized a lot of it wasn't Fitzgerald. And then I remember a while ago (I think during my CTY summer) a collection of Fitzgerald's letters to his daughter Scottie came out. But now I think, I don't really want to read letters. I'll just rent some Fitzgerald.   So the Bookaneer was ok, but not great, but then again I've never visited a used bookstore that was satisfying. I'm tempted to ask Mom to take me back to the messy one in Camarillo (where I found an excellent new Gatsby for $1 and the owner looked cheated when we brought it up to the register) and sift through all the Jackie Collins and cookbooks and blah blah blah and find something really worth my time. I'd like Leaves of Grass, maybe. I saw Ginsberg today, but I think he's a little too cryptic and nonconformist for me. I brought my book list along but didn't find anything on it today.   I asked the lady at the desk. Ooh, by the way, I think she plays harp or something because behind the desk there was a small harp and a beautiful wooden stand, and also celtic harp CDs. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tiff. Anyways, she said the other store further down TO had closed and A Novel Idea in Agoura was just about to. I ventured down to the other side of TO and went into the Sav-On/Vons shopping center and didn't find anything. I think Jennifer said something about Sav-On and Ralphs. I did see a storefront where the name in lights had been torn out, so I assumed that's where it used to be.  And then I went up Grey Rock once, just for kicks.
