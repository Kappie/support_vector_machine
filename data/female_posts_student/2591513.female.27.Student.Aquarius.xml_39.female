I wish we had the "know how" to have walked away fromt he deal losing 2 grand instead of thousands more...but in your head you think...2 grand is a lot...and don't see that you will ose mor ein the long run...  Anyway, ramblings...ramblings of a tired person trying to make sense of everything while sanity and hope crumbles around.  I will be okay, I will come through this...and well all I wonder about is when...now would be a good time.
