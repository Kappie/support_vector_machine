"We reject the false doctrine that the church could have permission to hand over the form  of its message and of its order to whatever it itself might wish or to the vicissitudes of the  prevailing ideological and political convictions of the day."         You are Karl Barth!  You like your freedom, and are pretty stubborn against authority! You don't  care much for other people's opinions either. You can come up with your own fun, and  often enough you have too much fun. You are pretty popular because you let people have their  way, even when you have things figured out better than them.          urlLink What theologian are you?
