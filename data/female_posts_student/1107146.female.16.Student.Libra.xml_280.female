New words, new take, etc.   A Bleeding Year  by Stranglebox  What good was my choice When I chose to face the light My brain is saying run  hide I take for granted The fact I haven't died But that good's brinked on suicide   CHORUS  Through a living waste To a brand new day I take in this breath Before it flies from me What I think I knew Bleed me, year, right thru Take my everything away  I talked for hours I never said a thing It hurts to think how much I've changed But I'm not the only One who is so high-strung I knew you once but you are gone   CHORUS  So c'mon and bleed me....  Best friend in patience Best friend I held your hand And we died crawling on the sand You look familiar Remind me of my old friends But bleeding years have faded them   CHORUS   INTERLUDE   CHORUS   INTERLUDE 2   So now, you got what you deserved? A bleeding year, a lesson learned?
