Each time I've been moved, I'm getting closer and closer to the DOOR. Dude, are they going to kick me out pretty soon?  I was moved again today. Yep thats my fourth time, one, ah two, ahh three, and ah four. This time I've moved to a cubicle with only four people surrounding me. Managers must think that I talked too much or being too shy. Nah, cant be, I'm normal like everyone else LOL.   My phone was taken away three weeks ago and that makes me a nobody. But hey I've gottan a brand new germ free phone today. So that makes me a somebody again yep yep check that. I think I should spit on the handle or the bottons tomorrow yeah I'll do that hehhehe.  Gosh, I hope that I wont be moved again any time soon. UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE!!!
