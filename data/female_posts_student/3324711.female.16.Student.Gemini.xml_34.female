And stuff thats fun for a while but then I wonder why I bought it. And its just because I have money. Sigh.  Although all the things that happen at work are pretty funny though.. plus Byron bought us a freaking icecream cake today [again] and I got some this time. Plus some candy. And cookie. Did I mention that I feel like throwing up?  On the bright side it is pretty good to have money and spend it on absolutely nothing. Or say, The Darkness CD or Laurens birthday present.  I cant wait for Hootie and APRIL WINE. I got a free ticket from working down there with Celebrate Canada, and its awesome. Apparently matt's working with us this year too. I wonder how thatll work out. I wonder if Ill get frustrated with him and freak out. After putting up with his crap for such a long time, I now have a very short fuse. But whatever, maybe it will be ok. And the concerts will be amazing.  OK So the dreads still arent in but MONDAY! Or Tuesday. I  will  have them in before next weekend.   Plus : I might be getting my nose pierced. Why? Because Ive wanted to for years and I have the money. And Im old enough now to go by myself. Screw my parents. They need to lighten up anyway. So thats a maybe.      ..so it looks like I was right when I said that this summer would be the best one yet. It has been so far at least.    Listening To:  Breaking The Girl- RHCP
