Yes, our band director told us to wear the Reed Band shirts, and Reed flute players were invading the room. Boo-yah. The second phase consisted of playing half of the fast etude (which was the whole thing that we learned), and the second part of the slow etude. I still had some hopes that I could beat Michelle, but the bad thing was that she went before than me. When I heard her play... holy crap, it was so good! She didn't mess up once, her tonguing was perfect, and her sound was just incredible. My chances of beating her were just 2%... but I didn't give up. I decided to try my best. Of course, I didn't do as well as her, but I was so fuggin' good at the slow piece, so I still had some chances.  The bad thing was that I was so fuggin' sleepy, and I think I was falling asleep while other people were playing. Heh, there were still a lot of people that... well, weren't playing very good. So it was my turn to play again... the slow etude. As I was starting, I messed up. Bullcrap, I thought. My chances of getting a better chair than Michelle-chan were just smashed into little pieces until there was nothing left. But I continued, and the rest was fine. I had done pretty good, though, compared to most of the people in that room (not counting Reed flutes, of course).  Once I was done playing, I went back to my sit and fell asleep. Was I tired or what? Sally-chan woke me up and told me that we had to go to the cafeteria because we were done with the second phase.  I was kind of upset with myself on how I had played during the second phase. I didn't play near as good as I had done on the first phase. Maybe it was because I was tired, or maybe it was because I had heard Michelle-chan play first, and that had caused my hopes to just burn. Either way, it didn't really matter. I was still sure I'd get like 6th or 7th chair... possibly 8th on the Symphonic band. I was hoping Sally and I would be sitting next to each other. XD  So my friends and I sat down on this... ledge-kind-of-thing near where they post the results. I'm telling you... I was trying to fall asleep in any place and at any time as I could. I took a walk of "disappointment" around the school that we were in... and I think I walked around twice, maybe three times. But no one cares a crap. When I came back, the results still weren't posted. So, I decided to sit down where my other friends were, too. I was still thinking of my performance in the second phase and how not-so-good I had played. I was trying to take that off my head, so I asked Yaqui how her performance had been. She told me that she did good, but the monitor lady had told them (Veronica, Sheniece, and Brittany S) to quite down a few times because they were making a bit quite of noise and were talking. Then she told me that since they were continuing being "loud," the monitor went and whispered to the judges, looking at them. I said, "Y'know, that's not good. You do know that you get points deducted for talking during the try outs, right?" She nodded, and she was starting to get a little nervous and worried because of that.  Y'see, our band director, Ms. Fedynich, was putting too much pressure on Yaqui-chan because Ms. F wanted for Yaqui to beat this guy from our "rival" school, Byrd, known as Elias (whom for some reason always looks angry). What? Ms. F had absolutely no right to put such pressure over Yaqui. I was hoping that she wouldn't beat him, because that'd be just too ironic and maybe Ms. F would learn to not tell kids what to do. Maybe that had jinxed Yaqui, 'cause the results were just not what I had expected.  A couple of minutes later, they posted the Percussion results. Some flute players went over and checked just for the heck of it, but when they told me that Erica H hadn't made it to neither of the bands, much less an Alternate, I was just shocked. What... the... crap?! I quickly looked over and I couldn't see Erica-san's name anywhere. What the fug was wrong with those idiotic and moronic fools that dare to call themselves judges?!? Erica's just an awesome percussionist, and whoever thinks otherwise must be shot right now. I could see that Shaw-san was right next to Erica-san, comforting her because Erica-san was crying. I could understand... I would have done the same if I was her. Then I noticed something that just made me drop my jaw to the ground: Shaw-san, another excellent percussionist (I'm serious) didn't make it to the Symphonic band, but to the Concert band... 1st chair. Now I just knew for sure, with no doubt at all, that those judges had been smoking while "judging." I know that those two girls are just amazing players, and that they could have easily made it to the Symphonic band. But what had gone wrong?  To make things worst, Jack P, a 7th grade percussionist from our school, had made it to an Alternate. No, I'm not trying to say that I have anything against Jack for being an Alternate and Erica-san not even being one, but when this happens, you know there's something wrong. Maybe Erica-san and Shaw-san got nervous, but who knows. The only understandable reason is that the judges were fugged up!  Every time a lady with a piece of paper would post something where they post the results, a bunch of brainless losers would run up over there. Of course, when they posted the flute results, I didn't stand up at all. Instead, I told Sally to tell me what chair and band I had made. I had heard that Sarah B had gotten first chair on the Symphonic band (well, of course... what else could she had expected?) and Ciarra second chair on the same band as Sarah. Instead of Sally-chan telling me what I had made, Michelle told me that I got 10th chair, and I had made it to the Symphonic band. 10th chair. I, dany the dot, had gotten 10th chair. There was extreme disappointment inside of me, but I didn't want to yell out and scream to let my rage out. What happened? I was expecting at least 8th chair, but 10th? I just sighed and said, "Oh well..." But I wasn't thinking of that exactly. I was so upset I could break a glass with my hand. Blast these stupid AR tryouts! What kind of idiot would have come up with this, anyway?! And I still think that these tryouts weren't worth at all. You'll see what I mean when I tell you what they gave us for having gone through such crap and pain. Morons.  It broke my heart when I heard Michelle-chan made 3rd chair. "Maybe she is better than me," I thought. Oh well, so what? The thing that made me feel better was when I heard that I'd be sitting next to Sally, for she had gotten 11th chair. It cheered me up a little bit to know that the person next to me would be someone I knew and considered my friend, not some other person that I had never seen before. See? I told you that we would always end up by each other! XD This was just great.  A couple of minutes later they posted the clarinets result. Yaqui was nervous, I could see, so she made Michelle go and check what chair and band she had made (hehe, poor Michelle XD). Yet another disappointment. Disillusions were everywhere in this stupid place. Yaqui-chan had gotten 11th chair on the Symphonic band. Blasted judges! When Michelle told us this, I had to go and check for myself. Maybe she was just making a joke or something, but I went up there and I saw that she was, unfortunately, right. Now, let's think about this. Yaqui told me that Veronica, Sheniece and Brittany S were talking and had gotten in trouble for talking, right? Well, these 4 clarinet players are one of the best clarinet players there is, and they could have gotten high chairs on the Symphonic band if they wanted to. But, the result was worst than they thought. All of those 4 fantastic clarinet players had gotten low chairs, and I'm pretty sure it was not because they sucked, but because they were talking and they had deducted points for that. I just knew that it wouldn't turn out well. What did Elias make? Second chair. Hurts, doesn't it?  So, yeah, I saw Yaqui's face and all I could see was big words written all over it that said, "DISSATISFIED". Not really, but still. I just wanted to get out of this heck of a place. I don't remember what time it was when we left (I think it was around 4 PM), but it was getting dark. We got into the bus and I sat by myself. I didn't feel like seeing anyone, much less talking to anyone. I was trying to sleep during our way back to RMS. Though, without an intention, I eavesdropped and heard a little conversation that Ms. F was having with Yaqui. I didn't hear all of it, though, much less remember the whole thing, but I do remember this, "Are you upset because you didn't do as well as you thought you would?" Darn straight, lady. Mr. Williams also talked to me. He congratulated me for making 10th chair, and to Sally and Michelle, too (they were sitting behind me). I just told him, "Thanx," and that I was expecting a higher chair than 10th. But, for some reason, Sally just... made me happy. Sitting next to a kick arse friend like her is the best thing that can happen.  When we got to RMS, I didn't even see Yaqui leave. I guess she really was angry. I went inside the band hall because I had to call my parents to pick me up. As I was waiting for someone to finish talking on the phone, I heard that Jack P was playing an etude for percussion. Shaw-san was right behind me, and I heard her say, "Who in the world is playing that song...?!" For some insane reason, I felt like laughing, but I didn't because I knew Shaw-san wouldn't find it funny. Since it was a Saturday, I told my parents all about that had happened on AR. I decided to get "drunk" to forget this horrible day. It sucks that you have to do it every year.
