I actually got offered a place in a community college for this summer. It was a course for high school students in business technology. There actually weren't many positions open and you had to qualify for it so I was surprised when they chose me. But I declined and my dad is still yelling at me for it. I'd rather spend my summer sleeping and partying. He says that was a really crap idea as the course involved experience and money off college. Screw that.
