Of course, I do know that it is possible to beat it, and when I come home from the mission trip, it's going to happen. The Garage Sale also came and went, but I'm just plain glad it's over. Of course, we will eventually have to do something with all that stuff in the garage. It really wasn't that bad since I had company. Ross came, and so did Trevor who brought Mairead. I love Mairead, she's so cute and so sweet. She's even pretty clever. She drew a picture of me, which I'm going to do my best to get on the blog, all I have to do is find a scanner... coughRosscough. I went to see Ross's play today: Cinderella. It wasn't absolutely awful, but I really didn't like it. By the end of the performance I hoped a random stage light would come crashing down on Cinderella... actually it was more like as soon as she started to sing. Anyway, don't go see it. It's definitely not worth the ten dollars the evil ones will try to collect from you. Although, I did get a kick out of their inability to get the curtain down during the one of the scene changes.
