You just have to have the right pieces To mend my heart to yours. You’ll need to untie my knots.   Either that or add to them.   Tangled up and lost It’s alright when I’m with you. Lose me in your soul though it is hard to feel lost at all When every place inside you Will fit me perfectly. I am your mystery I am the one you need when you run out of oxygen it’s me you’re going to breathe
