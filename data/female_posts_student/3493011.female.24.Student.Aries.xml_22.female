For the past 2mths, it has been hell being apart..relying on phonecalls to get us through and gosh the amt of marnie of both us spend on the calls *gasph* But it's awesome that he's coming back in 8hrs time.. I can't wait.. my heart is beating fast as each min. ticks away.. I have mixed feelings abt our initial face-to-face meeting..how will it be like.. we've been speculating for the past few days and even planning on things to do once he gets off the plane..seems bizarre, yes, being away for so long can be make us do silly things...  Today has been pretty tiring for me..I don't really know why but maybe I'm gonna get my peroid soon... juz supa tired.. plus the weather is not doing any good.. I think when I look through the archives again I'll be tabulating the no. of times I've been cursing this damn weather... I'm kinda on a emotional low, despite the anticipation of Terence which by rite shld make me hit the ceiling, maybe becoz I saw some of the OCFers today... in uni.. I feel distant and sense that unconciously I've built a wall agst myself and them.. I love them heaps but the friendships are juz made up of "hi and bye" nothing personal and connective... it's sad.. maybe it's juz that life by itself is meant to be lonely... recently, it struck me that even though I may hav made really close frens through my stay in melb..but maintaining it is juz so difficult... my perth frens hav become a distant memory.. soon, my melb frens will fade away shortly..   A depressing fact but such is life..
