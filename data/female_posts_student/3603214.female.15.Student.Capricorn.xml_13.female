"Jeremy" was takin him out to dinner. I was like w/e...I don't give a crap. So he left. My mom was gonna do some investigation n go check @ kate's n then dad's apartment. i was tryin to have some faith in him but ya kno, laziness too took over n i'm pissed that it did. she found them @ my dad's. just last week he mentioned he wanted to work on coming home once again. that's a p.o.s. remark. my mom had words w/ them n she threw a pic of the two of em @ the wall, smashed it, n the wall's dented. I'M SO F-IN PROUD! cuz if I was there, more damage would have been done. My mom told Kate that I hate her n Kate got offended. GOD FORBID Kate gets offended. She can kiss my white gurl ass. God I'm so mad that I wasn't there. But yea, mom came home, told me everything that happened. Here I am regretting not going. THEN Dad calls over here. I was like kno what, I can be phony too. N then he was all worried that mom was gonna ruin his things that he's gonna 'move out of here' *cough lie* And I was like you'll be lucky that I don't destroy your precious possessions because I'm more likely to than her. So yea. Kate always has this thing with telling people she'll pray for them. So I shoved that into his face. I was like "Dad, I'm gonna pray for you" like all sincere n shit. My mom was clapping for me cuz Kate's a prissy bitch who's oh-so-religious and wants to pray for the world! It felt good. Then my mom left to talk to my uncle bout more insurance stuff cuz my dad was bein an ass earlier. And then...about 10-15 minutes ago. He had NERVE to call back! I was like listen, we're gonna make arrangements for somebody else to take me to the bus for chicago. Then he asked for my mom, I told him she wasn't here. He was like yea...right. And I was like boo...like I would lie. If I did, I would do a better job than him. And then he was like this isn't between me n you, this is between me n your mother. I was like dad, this IS between me n u. It's your fault too. You insist on hangin onto Kate who I despise more than I can say. And it's really hard to hold back cussin cuz my parents don't know that I do. It's gettin harder n harder everyday. O yea, back to my story. I explained that all these times that he's been wanting to come over or go to my honors stuff, they've been out of sympathy. I didn't want him at any of those things and the reason why I didn't wanna go out to eat for lunch today was because I didn't wanna b seen in public with him. So now, I'll limiting him to an optional telephone call everyday. All I know is, I'm NOT callin him while I'm gone. I told him that he depresses me and that if he returned, I would become insanely depressed. But since there was never hope, my mom is gonna try to get a lawyer I think *finally* *sighs* He still hasn't listened to the tape I gave him. I wouldn't be surprised if he chucked it. O well, it'll haunt him and I'll make sure he listens to it. So at the end of our convo I said in a phony cheery voice, imitating Kate whether he knows it or not, HAPPY FATHER'S DAY DAD! BYE! slam. Ahh...it's so nice to yell at him....I'm gonna put an ad in the papers for a new father. If any of your parents would be willing to partially 'adopt' me, TELL ME. I'll gladly be your sister *n that would kick*. So my love to all fathers...you can all kiss my ass.
