When I got home from school my mom gave me my special halloween goodie bag full of candy! yippeee! So I ate all the peeps. YUM! Then I went to rowing. We had a test thingy today. It was BAD. I almost thew up peeeps! Yuck! I didn't finish last this time! yipppeee!  Then I went home and packed my bags. Sara came and picked me up and we ran off to Heathers house. When we got there we ate piiiizzzza then we changed into our costumes and went TRICK OR TREATING!! It was SO much fun! :) We saw two scary people from school though...this kid named Beau and the HALL LADY!!!!! She is the scariest person ALIVE! Hhahahahah.  Then we went home and watched The Ring. It wasn't that scary. 5 days!! :)  Lalallaa Then we went to bed. I got about 6 hours of sleep.    Then we woke up and ate. Then I left and went to piano.  The End
