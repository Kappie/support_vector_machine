I got last week's paycheck today.. $72 last week for doing pretty much nothing. Filling styrofoam cups with soda and handing towel-wrapped children their Snickers. It's great! Haha.  And then I'm working every day next week pretty much.. Sunday at the club, Monday babysitting for the Klostermans all day, Tuesday at the club, Wednesday off, Thursday at the club, and then Friday babysitting for the Klostermans. Babysitting is from 8 AM - 4 PM and then the club changes every day, but usually mid-afternoon which isn't bad. And no more six hour shifts thank God, because that was just plain MONOTONOUS! (hehe Em, Goodson, Claire)  Hope to go see The Day After Tomorrow on Saturday with some people.. Em and I are organizing it I believe. :-D  Late night summer MSN chats are the best.. hehe.
