Why do I do this time and time again, putting myself in situations I dread.  Even as I pose the question the answer forms in my head.  I do it because I care so damn much about what others think of me.  Not my close friends, the ones that matter, but all the other people out there.  I suppose I could say that it is silly and move past this but it isn't.  While I absolutely love having close friends seclusion scares me.  Last Friday I had flex day with about 35 people and I only knew one of them and a handful of names, a very small handful.  Yet I know that going tonight will not change that but some nagging voice in the back of my head is pushing me onward while the rest of me stays behind.  I guess I'll go and listen to that voice.
