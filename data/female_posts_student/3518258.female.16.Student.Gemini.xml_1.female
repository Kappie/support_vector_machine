I know what i did was wrong thats why your love for me isn't so strong. It tears me up that we aren't together I wish we still were and ill wish it forever.  You got your girl to hold your hand and holding mine is another man. We say we're happy we say we're fine but in our hearts and in our minds we want eachother more but i did wrong and left your heart sore.  This feeling i feel is giving me a fear that only leaves a tear. You see without you im incomplete only for you my heart will beat. My choices i made and the roads i took when we lost it all just made my life fall.  I want you more then ever please come back and stay forever!
