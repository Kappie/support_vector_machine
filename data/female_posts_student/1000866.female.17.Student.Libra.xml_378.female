Argh, I know this is rather random but I've got this weird feeling in my nose constantly like I'm going to sneeze. It's driving me insane. Grrr. Poo on a stick.   Today was actually an OK day. Except for getting hit with that hockey stick in gym. Ow. That happens pretty much every day though so....eh.  I'm in a pretty decent mood right now, but I'm not looking forward to the weekend at all. Marching like....ALLLL weekend. Getting there at 8:00 in the morning when we don't perform for another 12 hours is CRAZY. It's just downright mean.   OK, I'm done writing for now. I must go finish my homework and whatnot. Why do I come online? It ALWAYS distracts for a few HOURS. Grrrr.
