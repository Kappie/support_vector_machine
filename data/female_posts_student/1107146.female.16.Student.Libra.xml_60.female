It's just that since the main point of conflict has vanished (i.e.: Lily hasn't posted here in forever/the night of the DI meeting is, in part, forgotten), I thought to introduce some MORE conflict! Heh, well actually, she wanted to talk to Rosie about some things...not that those things matter anymore, nor do I know how any of this is relevent anymore...  Then again, I'm always jumping to conclusions...you'll see when she gets here, probly not 'til Monday.  But time will tell.
