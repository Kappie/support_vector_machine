(why cant i rhyme when i write!?)i wrote this about 3minutes ago and am extremely psyched about it.  here she is. cheers and bottoms up!  summer nights part 1 (i have a feeling i'll write something else like it) Well, out on my porch it’s a whole other world of charming guys and dancing girls. It’s another way of life on this side of town, sipping lemonade in laid back lawn chairs just as the sun goes down. Then we turn up the radio and some guy kicks up the band and we grab a hand and spin, cause life’s so fast like that. and we fill the night with laughter for everyone who can’t and try to think how there’s so much more to life. But for now it’s just warm summer nights and a couple dozen pitchers of lemonade with a beat up radio on the side, cause for now that’s all we need to get us by.  all work  © smokeycustard
