Quite the dirty mind on that boy ... but that only makes it more fun, since he's pretty much the only one in his group that will say that kind of thing. I loved listening to the music tonight (when I was paying attention) - it gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. Music is such an amazing thing, with its ability to change a person's mood or thoughts. I love it! However ... not everything tonight was good ... bad things lurk beneath the surface.      I'll be the first person to admit that I am by no means the best person to date. Quite the opposite, I can be quite the wicked little bitch. However, I have been nothing but fantastic lately (all because of a very positive influence from Jess and Andy) and I haven't been getting anything fantastic in return. Why is it that when I'm nicer to people, people are more cruel to me? No, cruel isn't the word, because this isn't intentional. At least, I hope not. My love life just isn't going the way I want it to be going right now.      I don't need to hear excuses, I don'twant to hear them from Andy, nor do I want to hear them from his friends. Everything started out so well, and then he goes on vacation and I become second tier. I don't expect to be number one (not even number five), and I don't want to be the center of his attention, but damnit, I'd like to have a little of attention. Unfortunately, I'm not getting any, I don't hear from him, I don't see him, and I don't know what to do anymore. Whyknowingly give myself that headache? Even Kunkel has been more of a boyfriend-like figure than him. Kunkel, for the love of God. I think I might have to stop abusing that poor kid, he doesn't deserve it. But anyway ... I sat back and thought about my situation with Andy tonight and wondered, "was it something I did?" and I decided against that thought. If I did anything wrong, it was in expecting too much from someone unwilling. My bad. Won't do that again. God I am so pissed off right now! I went into this summer with so many prospects, so much fun at my disposal, and then I met Andy and gave that up, because he was just so perfect.  PERFECTION IS A CRUEL ILLUSION!  He swept me off my feet, wormed his way in, and now I hurt more than any other rejection I've ever experienced. And now I'm crying ... great. Just turn me down already, Andy. It was fun, I"m not sorry for meeting you.      Maybe I'm being melodramatic. Actually, it's quite possible that that's all I'm being. Sorry if I am. I really do think that maybe I just blow this out of proportion, maybe I'm just expecting too much from Andy because I see what Jess and Kirby have and I'm insanely jealous. Oh well. If that's the case, then, well, my bad.      On my final note of the evening - people who purposefully ignore the fact that you're uber pissed off and act cheerful when you're seething on the inside ... those people need to be beaten. It's a condescending thing to do. At least acknowledge the anger. Don't be a fuckhead. Especially when you're dealing with a fiery temper like mine, ANDY.      I love you all!   Your Sweetest b
