Pointless! anyway.i have sooo many peeps i need to talk to about days out, like down to paignton and stuff. god i am going to busy this summer. and this summer is supposed to be my break! its too warm, or is it just me. i cant believe it is this warm and i'm not even slightly tanned. its just ridiculous. its being stuck inside revising. i mean, i know i cud do it outside but its just too distracting. better go. gotta revise for history..... *damn distractions*
