Well anyway Becky has Driver's Ed on Monday so she can't go. *Smirk* Anyway I was just trying to say that I've spent so much time with you all that I needed time with my other friends. Between us, we've had too much happen this year. I need a chill out group that I can get to know again. You know how at the beginning of friendships they always are all happy, it's only when you get to know a person too well that the unhappiness comes. I need that constant happiness right now. Sorry. I don't think I can deal with too much right now. This year has been the worst with the grape vine and I'm just too tired to deal with all that. I hate gossip and I wish that it was alive so that I could torture it and kill it.
