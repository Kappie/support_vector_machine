I enjoyed yesterday, I thought that the purpose of it all did work. I know my form seem a lot more relaxed with each other. My tutor is Miss Wilkins. Great. I have in my form who I know and get along with well, Olly, Max, Matt (can't remember his second name) and Lee Reeves. Then there are Michelle and Lisa who obviously I know and all. It should be okay. I also have Charlie in my form and he is a good laugh so should work out fine. I can't see how the Sixth Form block will work at lunch what with the lower and upper sixth all in at once. That's gonna be crazy. New guy James, was a bit lost at lunch as he couldn't find people so I told him to come on over and eat with us. Then Tom took him and the new girl Jenny off to the shops. Bless them. Bless Tom.
