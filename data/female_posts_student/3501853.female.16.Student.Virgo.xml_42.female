Louie 10-13-87~07-04-02 *love you  "I miss you a little since you've been gone A few little memories keep hangin' on I miss you a little, I guess you could say A little too much, a little too often A little more every day"-John Montgomery  "Life ain't always what it seem to be Words can't express what you mean to me Even though you're gone, we still a team In the future, can't wait to see If you open up the gates for me Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend Try to black it out, but it plays again When it's real, feelings hard to conceal Can't imagine all the pain I feel Give anything to hear half your breath I know you still living your life, after death Every step I take, every move I make Every single day, every time I pray I'll be missing you Thinkin of the day, when you went away What a life to take, what a bond to break I'll be missing you"-Sting/Sean William Combs  I'm back in good ol' Des Plaines. The trip back took 8 hours no joke. We got delayed in a Phoenix Airport for 7 hours because the weather was too bad but we found out later on like 6 other airplanes went out to Chicago and the Midwest area while we were waiting so that was just dumb but I guess it was kinda ok cuz I got to spend 7 hours with my mom and it was kinda nice then when we finally got on the plane, they had to take the plane back to the gate because the engine wouldn't start and they took some black guy off the plane cuz he was a threat or w.e. then after what seemed forever, the engine finally started although it made a really weird sound but I was just glad it finally got going. We got home at 1:40 in the morning, Tim wasn't so happy about it. We told him all the details about the trip and all he could talk about was work, his time with Mike and their trip to Menards while there was a storm out. I loved his story except he wondered why I teared at one part of it but ya. The trip itself was great, the beginning was hard but after a lot of time thinking by the ocean and at the beach and of course being with my wonderful grandparents, I got myself happy cuz I realize I've lost most of the people I ever love (but thank god manged to keep some with me now thank god so much for that) but the ones I did lose, I lost due to my selfishness and self-pity so I need to suck it up and at the very least, learn from it. "i need 2 make mistakes just 2 learn who I am"-i think that quote is pretty fitting..but ya I can't ruin their lives anymore by talking about it so much and indirectly nagging them...although I still sleep with the picture frame of us in our dresses, sleep with his sweater and his bears, and wear his pink bracelet...I can't go on indirectly holding them back with my self-pity..I have to just try and go on,one breath at a time. Okay enough about that because there is a lot more to say about it but I will just end it with this: I love you, I miss you, I'm sorry. Tim told me when my mom and I got back that there was something different about me that he couldn't pinpoint but i definitely changed, that's the best compliment he's ever given me and I don't think he even knew it.  Today was July 4th. Ana called me when I got up at like 1 so I started getting ready and went to her house. I hung out at her house for a bit and we were gonna go to Sugar Bowl but we didn't have much time so we just went to Burger King. After that, we went to Dominick's to get Louie his flowers. I got a text from Art when we got to Dominick's, it was a nice text just asking where i've been and wut's up. Anyways, we decided to get him a dozen white roses but we wanted to get him a balloon too. All the balloons were like 'happy birthday' and 'get well soon' so I was getting annoyed til I saw a red balloon that said 'i love you'. I showed that one to Ana because that was one of the balloons he got me and I was gonna tell her it was pretty, I didn't get to tell her that he got it for me cuz all she could say was that it was pretty (lol). We wanted to get Lou an 'i miss you' ballloon but 'i love you' was very suiting too. We got in the car and Christy Beers and Ashley was parked next to me so I said hi then we drove to the Shell Station to visit Louie's corner. I decided that we should write in the back of the balloon so we did and Louie: I swear to God we didn't mean 2 sound suicidal lol we just miss you. Okay the visit was fine and all..just looking at his picture and remembering all the memories. God, in two years nothing has changed. I miss him now as I did then, the only thing different is how much we've grown up from this experience. In a way, whoever had to go through it had to grow up too early, even b4 high school, and wether we liked it or not, we faced a hard time in our life and Louie: god you'll never be forgotten. I'll never forget after an assembly in Chippewa you sppinning me around saying "Who's your best friend Camille" and so many other memories..I love you. While we were there, this white Honda pulled up to the Gas Station and parked there and just fucking stared at us. It was really scary but luckily Jorge came just in time. His car is nice, you're lucky Ana (lol). Ana walked me to my car so the white car wouldn't follow me and she got so scared for me, she made me write Jorge's cell # down to call her in case they were following me cuz her cell was dead! That was soo sweet and loving of her   After my little trip with Ana, I went back home then went to church with mom and Tim. We got home and Mik called right away crying :'( I told her to come over right away and she was explaining to me her fight with her dad. It was horrible I offered her all of my Kleenex and hugs. It was hard I didn't wanna intrude cuz Mike (her dad) is my neighbor but Mik's such a great girl and is a friend so of course I knew even tho he was my neighbor, Mik came first and I wanted to take her from her pain and I really did try but Mike wouldn't let her go anywhere. We were gonna go to the Elk Grove fireshows but he wouldn't let her. I wanted her to just spend the night but he wouldn't let her. My mom, Tim, and I ended up going to a Mount Prospect carnival to watch **fireworks** but she couldn't come and I was bummed out cuz I knew she was so sad but nonetheless, the fireworks were amazing. They were so big and pretty, even when they fall down, they're still pretty, I liked them a lot. Mik: I hope you feel better, I'm here for you just one house away. I wanted to call Kev tonight after the fireworks show to catch up and what not but it was too late when I got home so I still miss him. Tomorrow, I'm working out at RecPlexx in the morning (cuz I got super fat from eating non-stop my grandparents "philipino" food (lol)) then I'm painting (Lolo (my grandpa) got me so many new brushes, a bunch of little 5x7 canvas and lots of paint so that was fucking great) and I'm starting my first painting tomorrow. After that, who knows, I can't predict the future so I'm just gonna take a shower at 1 in the morning and go to sleep with my t.v. blasting..that right there, is independence haha, happy fireworks day   "...I tried not to hurt you but I did...Is that why they say...Every rose has its thorn, every cowboy sings a sad sad song..."-Poison
