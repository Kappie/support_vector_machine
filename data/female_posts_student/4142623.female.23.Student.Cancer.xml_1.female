I have been packing and working on my dad's birthday present for about two hours, and I'm about fed up with it. Stupid packing. My mom's having a surprise birthday party for my dad's fiftieth birthday Sunday!!! Yeah! All the peeps I love from DCC will be there. Tonight, I went to Wal Mart, McDonald's, and Monarcas with Case. I ate a  meal  at McDonald's. Wooooah. I never do that. I had that new "Chicken Selects" thing. It was pretty good, but in no way can it compare to Willy T's or Zaxby's. Or Chick-fil-A. Go my employer for three years! Woot woot. Ok, I am starting to get jittery about having to go back to school in a week. Boogersnot. Why can't we have just one extra week??! I have still not written my thank-you cards from my birthday. I feel very guilty. ...Ok, now it's Friday. Moving day! Case and I went to Wal Mart a second time last night just for the heck of it at about 11:30PM. I found a frame for my dad's birthday present. And we saw Murfen. Then we came home and drank green apple Smirnoff and watched Joe Schmo 2. Ok, well, I will write more later. Gotta go hit the packing. Au revoir, mon amies!!!!!
