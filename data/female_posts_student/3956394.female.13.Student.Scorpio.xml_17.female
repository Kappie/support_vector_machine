Our bill turned out at $63.94 dollars.Oh how mad i was that she picked out everything expensive... I was ebaressed to tell the lady we had to much items and to take some out but i had to.I told my mom what happened and now shes is finally in trouble.Its not only the money thing that made me mad though.It was that I would pick some stuff out and yet she would yell to me that i picked out the wrong thing.I wanted to send her home then and there even though we were shopping for her.Even the littlest things can get you mad, she said.Well i think SHE is the one who should calm down.Right now i have the worst headache ever.. >.>Im just warning you guys:  One thing thats ticks me off is what i just wrote.If you want to be on my good list, PLEASE dont EVER yell at me (Esepecally if im older then you) and dont ever get between me and my sisters fights unless YOU want to be the one beat up.
