But now, I’ve grown, I’ve set my foot in real waters where I’ve realized the difference between a dream and a reality. I would have to admit that I’m not the type of girl every man is dreaming of. With occasional breakouts, a bulging tummy, bad hair days almost 6 times a week, without the Snow White type of complexion and definitely not the supermodel physique I wished for, it makes me a tad insecure. At the same time, a lot less closer from my dream of prince charming falling madly in love with me. So now, my real life journey begins. It was a stagnant weekend when his best friend invited me to watch a movie with them. The movie was a chick flick that had so much publicity that made me nosy about it although I was pretty sure that that certain flick was just a waste of money. It was the kind of movie that even stupid people could already conclude the ending for it was labeled as the “way-too-impossible-because-no-rich-man-could-love-a-maid” kind of movie. But since, I was curious and didn’t have anything to do that Saturday, I decided to go with them. During the ride, we weren’t talking that much. I was a bit shy not knowing the reason behind it. When we arrived at the ticket booth, we saw that we were half an hour early than the next showing so we decided to eat a light dinner. My other friends led him and me to this fast food chain but it seems that my appetite wasn’t hungry for that genre of food. I just stood there, hesitating to order anything for I was really craving for sweets!!! Luckily, he was looking at me. It seems that he read my mind as he asked me if I wanted to eat somewhere else. I agreed as we left our other friends eating burgers and fries and then he surprisingly took me to this bakeshop full of mouthwatering cakes and pastries that are to-die-for. I ordered my favorite cake as he ordered his and then got a chair and awkwardly waited for our food to be arrived. “Sabi ko na nga ba, gusto mo kong maka date eh!” I joked to ease the awkwardness creeping towards the both of us… he laughed and rode with it as that single joke broke the silence between our 2 souls. I was seated facing him, while I kept on psyching myself not to show any emotions of kilig or any other feelings related to it. Our food arrived shortly and we ate…  	We had a pleasant conversation and I found it difficult to hide the smile in my face while we were talking. I couldn’t interpret whether he was being super friendly or just plain sweet. Though I wanted to believe in the latter, I decided to lower my expectations as I told myself “Wag ka na!! Walang gusto un sayo!!!” so I just had a nice talk as little by little, I learned some info about him. After quite a while, I saw our friends outside waiting for us. I looked at the time and realized the movie was about to start. We took our last sip on our iced tea and went straight to the movies.  It was kind of him to be seated right next to me for the next 2 hours. I felt so protected and so comfortable to be near him. It has only been a month since I’ve really known him but I felt safe knowing his presence was near me.  As I watched the “Cinderella movie” I couldn’t help but wonder if it could also happen to me. I was just a plain simple girl, slowly falling in love with a guy I know I couldn’t have. Based on my sources, I know a handful of girls are crazy for him, including me, and that he still hasn’t had any girlfriends, which made me assume either he wasn’t the commitment type of guy or whether he is just too picky when it comes to dating women. Either way, I had no chance. I know it isn’t bad to dream but if I’d keep on dreaming, I know it would only hurt me.   	I was confused whether or not to believe in my childhood dream of prince charming or to just forget about it and live life as it is supposed to be. If a mere person wrote that movie, then maybe, it could still happen with a real person like me. Was I asking for too much or was it O.K? The very thought of it maims me.          The movie ended just exactly the way I expected it… He fell in love with her despite of her imperfections and a low stature compared to his. They married and lived happily ever after blah blah blah blah… we both went out of the movie house as I followed his lead. He looked at me and asked, “What can you say?” you know what I said? “In reality, a guy like that could NEVER fall in love with a girl like her!” he smiled and said, “I agree!”  His words were so powerful that it rang over and over and over again in my head. Sadly, the movie was just like us. He was a highly statured man while I was just a maid. He could never see the way I see him. He will never look at me like the way I look at him.   	After the movie, he treated me out on a cup of ice cream and we sat together with his best friend. I felt the tickle of the midnight’s air brushing my skin. I looked at the vast sky as I waited for a falling star to appear so I’d wish upon it. He saw that I was quiet as he talked to me as we exchanged out thoughts that night. After the last spoon of ice cream and a couple of chitchat, they decided to drop me home… “Thank you.” I said with a compelled smile. “I had a great time.” It was during that time that I slowly saw their car vanish into thin air.   Now you’re asking me what happened next?!? No, I didn’t leave a glass slipper so that he’ll come back. I didn’t turn into a mermaid to swim distant oceans just to see him, nor did I ride a magic carpet just to tell the whole world how much I loved him. I just went straight to bed, thought about him and told myself; “You’re a big girl now… and it’s about time you let go of that little Cinderella dream…”
