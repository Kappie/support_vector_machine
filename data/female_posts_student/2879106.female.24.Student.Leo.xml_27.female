From there we went to Ambers and we rented the movie called the perfect score. (at least I think that is the name of it) It was a pretty good movie. The Asian guy in it was fucking crazy funny!!!! Then I took Alek home because he has to be in bed early for work. I left there and went to JoJo's to meet up with some friends. The waitress sucked big time!!! I mean hell I know there was about ten of us but shit, it's not like we all ordered steaks. It took her about twenty minutes to bring the check. What the hell is that? We probably would have waited longer if Tom hadn't went up and asked for her to bring them. Anyway, I had a good time. That was my Fourth. Oh I did see some of the river fireworks. That was cool, even though I saw them from my car. Good Times!!! Well I hope everyone reading this had a good time too, even though you were too good to hang with me. BOO HOO, Cry Cry!!
