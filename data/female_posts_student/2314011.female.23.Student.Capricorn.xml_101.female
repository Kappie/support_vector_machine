I suppose we could track the first of them back to last summer's conversion to the study/practice of Yoga.  Then there was the autumnal addition of tea to my regularly-ingested substances.  But things really kicked into high gear in January.  Maybe the gurus were offering additional incentives to their minions like free dredlocks for the biggest, most dramatic conversion.  Because really, the last two months have seen some major shifts:  regular lunches at the Co-op; trading AOL for Earthlink; substituting Lucky Charms/Honey Nut Cherrioes/etc. for Grape Nuts each morning; and the most recent:  the local Top 40 (read: Pop music disguised as hip hop) station's been usurped on my clock radio for NPR.  There's just something about listening to a British woman tell me about the weather in Pullman that's uniquely fulfilling.    What's next?  Substituting my usual capitalist deodorant for crystals??!
