Besides, I needed a break. And, I was feeling like... well, I think that goes without saying. So what's to do with a few spare hours? The three Rs. Read, Ramen, and Rebma (amber spelled backwards) Darling Amber came to visit today around 1 with super fun birthday presents. Then around 2:30 I went to school to work on art, but got very very very little done. Now I'm back to where I started, just not feeling quite so.... bad. I might go see Pirates tonight. I'm not so sure anymore though. Oh well. Good night, dear void.
