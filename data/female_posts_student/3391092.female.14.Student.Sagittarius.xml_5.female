When i got there i went and looked at mine and dougs names to see what class we were in and we wernet in the same one! and then i found dougie and we were walking to our class and he looked on the list and he knew a ton of ppl in his class and i only knew 2 ppl... yah know i had to get in a class where you are assigned a partner and the 2 ppl i knew were partners w eachother!!!! and then this sophmore jessica became my partner and she was nice and yeah. so then we did a group project and this girl ariel was in my group and she seemed cool she went to greenspun... and then at break i went and met up with willie tim charlie mark ryan and everyone and we hung out and then yeah but over all there was a lot of work in my health class like we did 2 power points, 2 chapter reviews, and 2 chapters from the book plus the group project. but i only have 13 days left!!! just gotta keep thinking that! lol
