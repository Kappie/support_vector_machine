What is she getting paid for?!...anyways...then I went take a 4 hour nap on the living room floor...listening to my dad bitch about how lazy we are...but OH NO...when it comes time to clean...he's nowhere in sight...my mom and I just got done looking and charms for these bracelets we got...I got a bunch of cute ones...woohoo...now I'm just blow drying and straightening my hair...yet another day in the interesting life of *bRiTbRo*
