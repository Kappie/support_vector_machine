I mean since today was the last day of conditioning before tryouts, we played 2 games, and then you could either scrimmage, or work on things with coach. Well we played 2 games of dodgeball (volleyball style, which is different from normal dodgeball), then we played 3 games of Snake...(it's a serving game). After that, I went off with coach, and a group of others. I practiced setting, and then i went with group and did passing and hitting. Then we did a 'freeball' drill...and I just kept sucking...I'm just pretty mad...I don't know why I'm so upset over it, but yeah, you know. Anyways, I might go to Ashley Bevan's tonight...and then tomorrow, we might go to the movies with Nick Spinelli, Brandon, and Alicia...but who knows. Hopefully we will get to go. Oh yeah, and tomorrow, I also have a carwash for volleyball from 10am-2pm...but I'm only going from 10-12.  Well yeah, I'm gonna go now. Talk to you later...maybe...
