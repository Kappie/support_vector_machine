To Dominique - Don't you take that picture!  I said not to take the picture!  We care for Care Bears!  Hotdogs with chilli.  Waking up *seatmates* to and from.  Ooh, souveniers!  I want that pimp hat (still goin this summer to buy a pimp hat rite?) In case you're scratching your head ("Must be a nice vacation for his balls" - Jennifer Coolidge, Legally Blonde), those are just some jokes from Kings Dominion trip with Math Analysis.  I must say, even though we didn't ride very many rides due to the long lines and muggy heat, I still had fun!  I basically hung out with Dominique, Julie Ann, Jennifer P., Paul, Bethany, Dominique and Carmen.  Tip: Don't try to be a cheapass and take a picture of your friends on the log ride, because 1). You will end up taking a picture of someone else's trip down, and 2). The picture will not turn out.  The bus rides were fun too.  I learned about Catholicism from Chandos, Mustafa and Alex, and I finished  Catcher in the Rye .  That was a good book, but I wasn't all that fond of the ending.  I can't forget the pancake breakfast either.  There, I found out that even though I suck at flipping pancakes at home, I'm really good in my math class.  I learned about horsepower too (apparently, corvette engines are really good).  There are some great pictures of both of the events too.  I do wish I had gotten that picture of Nathan (or Matt, can't remember which), flipping a pancake up into the air, with me trying to catch it on a plate.  Initially, I had it, but it flopped off the plate.  Luckily, Bobby caught it before it hit the floor.  I'll have to get those pictures developed soon, but first I'll have to finish off the pictures on the white camera.  I think bringing it to chemistry one day will accomplish that. Thursday night at work wasn't so good.  My trainer was mad at me (you can always tell just how mad she is by the force with which she sets stuff down, and the plastic containers were bouncing on the countertops), and I was really drained and worried about finishing my paper on the History of Trigonometry (aka busy work).  I was really down and about to scream, when, while carrying dirty dishes to the kitchen to be washed, "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" comes on the radio.  That's one of Shaheen's favorite songs.  It was like she was there (even though she's in Bataar or some Middle Eastern country), just saying something like, "It's ok poppet, only two hours to go."  I'm sure she would have said something more intelligent though.  Anyway, that just instantly cheered me up (plus, the song really is beautiful).  That, and the calculation I got when I tabulated how much money I would make on my first paycheck.  Too bad my dad told me that I calculated one week too many, and my paycheck is back to being nowhere near enough.  I suppose I'll be chillin at CRA in my spare time instead of chillin at the mall.   I need to finish my Vice President speech for NHS, so I'll end it with this (provided from the senior surveys I was browsing through from the You Had To Be There Reflector...that's sophomore year for the class of 2004, and freshman year for class of 2005): "I shall miss these things when it all rolls by" -DMB, from Joe B.'s quote, and "Anyone can catch your eye, but it takes someone special to catch your heart" -DMB, from Lauren J.'s quote.  Later.
