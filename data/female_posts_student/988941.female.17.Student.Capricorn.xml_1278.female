Paul - I have seen the way you look at me  Right, today i took out my girlfriend to Croydon, we looked in strange shops then went to pizza hut, then went to see 50 first dates, (was fairly good but was one of them typical films where you can predict the end from the start!) Then i went to her house to 'meet the parents' and i dont think i should make a comment about that so publicly. Anyway then when i got home wayne gave me a call and said do ya wanna come bowling so i said yea course. So then i had to go back to gf 'Becky's house and pick her up then we spent the evenign bowling. Just got home, didnt win, far from it. (i am sure it was a computer related problem and nothing to do with how i bowl) Anyway most of you seem to be writing short messages, and i can really go on when i want to so i think i will now finish, (you dont all wanna know about my strange and mucked up life) So looks like i am gonna watch the rest of this film (on BBC1, not bad actually, comic moments) Then go to bed, hope you are all well, and see you all tuesday!
