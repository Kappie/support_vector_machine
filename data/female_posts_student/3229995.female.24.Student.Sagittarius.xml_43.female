Vadim asked his wife to play the main part...often not such a good idea (!) even when that is aerobics queen Jane Fonda. This film really made me laugh, it is both intentionally and unintentionally funny (I think...) I am not sure what the film was trying to be, but the message is clear: Make Love Not War! (With angels and aliens if you can...) It's a sci fi swinging sixties show with a gruesome soundtrack. The costumes are fantastic. The dialouge is hilarious. Barbarella walks around "the universe" in some fantastic outfits, including a skunk suit...    THE PLOT  It is year 40 000. Barbarella is floating around and taking her clothes off in her red spaceship (complete with orange shag-carpet) when she gets The President of the Earth (!) on her videophone. He needs her to find the evil scientist Duran Duran and discover where he is hiding his terrible weapon, The Positronic Ray. This could destroy the harmony of the galaxy where Peace  Love has reigned for years. (Yep, it was made in the sixties...)   But why her? Well, she is the only five star, double-rated astronautical aviatrix available! She doesn't start off very well though. Her spaceship crashes and she is captured by cruel children, but saved by The Catchman. She repays him by making love...the "old fashioned way". (In the 41. century, making love is done by taking a pill and holding hands, as it was proved to be "distracting for maximum efficiency".)   Barbarella meets a blind angel, Pygar, who doesn't make love, he IS love (!) Together they fly to the city of Sogo. Here everyone walks around in vintage French S gear, if they are not chilling out, smoking "The Essence of Man" (from a large bong with an actual man floating around in it...)    Barbarella is almost killed several times, by man-eating dolls or evil canary birds. The Excessive Machine (AKA Orgasmatron) tries to kill her with too much pleasure!       "When I reach the cresendo you will die with pleasure! Your death will be swift but sweet. Very sweet."     In the end she discovers Duran Duran, runs around in psychedelic landscapes for a while and finally saves the universe from being swallowed by an evil lava lamp monster.   WHO WROTE THIS DIALOGUE?  Pygar is captured by...well, someone evil and Barbarella comes to his rescue: "Decrucify the angel, or I'll melt you face!" The Tyrant:  "You're very pretty pretty pretty' Barbarella: "My name isn't pretty pretty, It's Barbarella!'
