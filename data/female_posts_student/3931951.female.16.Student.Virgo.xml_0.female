We went and played on the bales (The joys of living in a farming community in rural Saskatchewan) and we were all jumping off of them onto other bales. Well, when I went to jump onto another bale, I fell down the entire stack of bales and landed right on my back. Oh my god, did that ever hurt. Ry was looking for me and here I ended up on the exact opposite side of the bales as him and had to walk through a great big puddle so deep my pants were drenched past my knees just to get back to the party. It sucked, but it was fun and I was so drunk that ten minutes later I couldn't feel anything anyways. I didn't get home until 4:30 in the morning. My mom almost shit a brick. Ah well. I went to my exboyfriend's house tonight and played X Box with O (My ex). We broke up on the first of July, and after only 24 days we're awesome friends. We party together and hang out a lot. I still love him a lot but I don't have the urge to go out with him again. The relationship lasted for almost 3 years, so I'm pretty much ready to be single again. Especially since next year I graduate and will be off to University where boyfriends will be such a distraction. Still love him though, and I really hope we'll be friends for a long time. He's a really great guy. And he's a really great fuck too. That's a plus. At least I still get to do that with him without having any emotional attachment and all that clinical/mental bullshit. Anyways, I should go to sleep. I have to work all day tomorrow... 10:30 am until 9:00 pm. wow! G'nite all.         luv, nic xoxo
