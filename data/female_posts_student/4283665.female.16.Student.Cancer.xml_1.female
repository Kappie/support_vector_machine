Truth is, she had earl grey tea, and i have cold coffee. Then we went to HMV because i needed to buy my dad a birthday present, considering its his birthday today.I got him Best of Phil Hartman (SNL) on DVD. Gilda bought Queen greatest hits for her moms birthday (tommorow). Say this guy Jay there...then we left, and met up with michelle. Then went to Barry square and hung out a bit with Gab and Glenkoe, them pro skater folk. Then i went home and gave my dad his DVD. He was happy. Soon we're going out for dinner, and my brother hasnt returned the movie he rented. Its due back in 20 minutes.  Gilda has a way of making me seem like an idiot in everyones eyes. hah.  since this summer is pretty much over, i'll write a list of my summer accomplishments: •being a fat kid •drinking far too much, too often •camera obscura, and everything in between •massively expanding my vinyl collection with glam rock •hating cindi lauper more than i can imagine •not being carded once •looking like shit everyday and not caring •skateboarding alot •getting free movie rentals. hah. •wife beater tan •going home (BC) and seeing all my friends (who i hadn't seen in 2 years) •breaking at least 3 toes at different times •managing not to get any action, whatsoever. •loving leroy (my acoustic guitar) more than i can imagine. •having the same nailpolish on since the starting of the summer,(its down to its last chip)        Gilda and Nadya are hot.
