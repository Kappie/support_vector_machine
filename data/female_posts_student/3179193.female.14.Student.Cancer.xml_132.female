I was just talking to BK on MSN and inviting him to Wonderland tomorrow but he said he had band practise tomorrow so he can't make it and we launched into a conversation about music and our bands. He has 1 drummer, 3 guitars, 1 bass, 1 vocal, and 1 backup singer. He sent me one of the songs they did and I was sitting there like: "WHOA! HOLY CRAP THEY'RE FUCKIN GOOD!" It's so cool! They don't have a name for their band yet but wow! Very cool!  Too bad they don't do English songs 'cos if they did, I'm sure they'll win that contest we're joining. I'm a fan of his band already. All Korean people. Haha! So typical of him. Tsk tsk tsk... LoLzZ~! Oh well, maybe we'll be able to hook up and visit PCW together again sometime this summer. Just like last year. Good times! Hehe!  Wow talking to two Brians at the same time. Brian Park and Brian Kim. Both Koreans. Haha!  Listening to BK's song again and listening to "The Voice Within".  I just said to Brian P that him and Alicia are so cute and he asked if it was a compliment. Haha! Silly kiddo! Of course it is.  Well, I'm off for now.
