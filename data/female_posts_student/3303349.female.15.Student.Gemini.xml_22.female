Oh my God I am so excited! I only have to sit through a week more of class with O'Hara and I am free and I'll be able to drive and have my independence. I have never had independence! I have always had to rely on some one else but I won't in what? Two weeks? Now all I need is a car...ha, laughable. But my mom is so crazy doing 9 things at once that she needs me to have my own car. Oh God I really haven't had much time to put it all into perspective. This is so great. Ahhhh...happy thoughts....Anyway, speaking of my insane mother, she is in Chicago right now. It is so nice to be completely and totally away from her! I haven't realised how stressful she makes everything. She really drives me crazy. I knew that, but I haven't realised the extent of it untill now. Gezze I am in a good mood now...Oh wow...I just rembered that I have a cousin that's supposed to be born today. My aunt is have=ing a C-section so it is coming today. Wow I totally forgot. I hope my grand ma calls so that I know what is going on. It's gonna be a girl I can fell it...I'll keep you up dated I guess!
