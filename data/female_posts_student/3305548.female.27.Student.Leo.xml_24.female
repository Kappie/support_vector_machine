However I did learn that if I travel the 2.5 hours and spend $50 on gas that somehow everything will be taken care of magically. Without waiting, and although I have been working on this for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks...GAH!!!!!!  That and the fact that when we deposit to the bank before 2PM and our debit card doesnt register it!!!!!!!!!!!! Grrrrr. Instant everything anymore but banking cant keep up. Financial aid cant keep up....we could buy stock in 10 minutes but the bank couldnt keep up!!!! The billing office can charge my account the right amount...but the FA office cant be bothered!!!!!!!!!!!!!  *Pant pant pant* Allrighty...venting hath happened.  over and out for now --mack
