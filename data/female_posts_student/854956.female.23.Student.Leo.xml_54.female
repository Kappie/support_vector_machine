Haloscan is doing some server work... and until they're done, I guess ya'll will just have to hold off on the comments.  If you'd like, you can send me emails at Drumr158@hotmail.com until the server work is done and comments are back up.  :-)  Hope ya'll have a spectacular day!  I have to write a paper... YUCK!
