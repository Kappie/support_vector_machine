We left San Antonio about 11:00, and we ended up at my Grandma's about 12:30 because we stopped to get some lunch for us all. So, we all sat down for lunch and had some good conversation, and then my Mom and I went over to my Aunt Mary's old place b/c we were going to look at a headboard and night stand that she wants to get rid of, as well as the full size mattress and boxspring. My Grandma felt bad because there was a loss of memory regarding HER full size bed/boxspring... and so she knew my Aunt Mary (who's now living in Houston, TX with her grandkids b/c she needs full time care) wanted to get rid of it and asked her if my friend Melissa could take it instead. OKAY, so... We went back over to my Grandma's and talked for about 1-1/2 hours. We were asking her what she's going to do with all her stuff, because she'll be limited on space when she moves to San Antonio. For those of you that don't know, she's moving here to San Antonio into an added on "house" to my Aunt Judy's. My cousin Kim's husband (Tim) has connections in construction. So he got a plumber buddy and a drywall buddy and several other "buddies" to commit to only charging my Grandma for supplies and not labor. Essentially she's paying 1/3 the cost it normally would've costed her. So, her little space is about done... she'll have a bedroom area, a living area, and her bathroom will also have a washer and dryer in it and a large amount of closet space for her clothes. She's getting anxious about moving, and she realized today there's no way she can take all her beloved pictures. She made a very sad comment regarding them saying, "I'll just leave them here, and when I die YA'LL can all take care of them." Given the fact that last September she had a heart attack and almost died, I don't like to hear her say stuff like that. Anyhow, I go into the office tomorrow for some paper work... I'll be filling out emergency cards for all the kiddos at my site! Kinda makes me excited, but at the same rate very STRESSED about all I have to get done the first 2 weeks of August before school starts(16 Aug.) for them. Plus, we're trying a new rotation program this year, so I'm hoping that all the craziness with that dies down before MY classes start 25 August. And, I'd like to be able to enjoy myself when I go to the  urlLink Dave Matthews Band  concert in Houston on 21 August with my sister in law Kathy! I wanna be able to have fun, and possibly get some stuff done at their house. I said I'd paint a room for them. I think I signed away my soul...  A  room will probably turn into 2-3 rooms .
