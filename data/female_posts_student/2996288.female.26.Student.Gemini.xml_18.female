Let me give you fair warning: I've only scored a 46% in pharmacology.  Do NOT let me prescribe any medications to you.  But if you want a diagnosis, I'll be your girl.  Well, at least 60% of the time.  The Practice is on tonight.  I always hated the show, but got hooked on it last year because my friends always watched it.  Now, they don't watch it as much, but I do.  Something seems wrong with that.  HA!  I've just fallen out of the weekly Sunday anti-social mode.  Time to find people to annoy.  Another of my specialties....
