Yesterday I drove Catherine back to Stockton, and just as we got into town I got a call from my mom asking if I would be willing to work a temp job next week (my mom works at a temp agency and has gotten jobs for the whole family, just not me yet). Because she and Catherine are going to Florida next week, her office needs a little help covering the front desk, answering phones and basic data entry. I told my mom the I was in Stockton, and so I went on in to fill out applications and go over a basic interview with my mom's co-worker, Marisol. This morning their manager (whose name I can't remember!) called and asked a few basic questions, and basically seemed to think I could do the work since I was a college graduate. Now it looks like I'll have a low level clerical job like Melissa, but it's only for a week, and I'll be spending the week in Stockton, visiting with my dad and Neb, and staying in the pool house. I think it ought to be an interesting week, and I'm glad I've been working on my blog and writing a lot of papers so I can type pretty competently.   So today I've been trying to catch up on the laundry that I fell so far behind since we had all of the guests last weekend. Tonight I'm going to Jerm's mom's for dinner, then I'm going to head out to Stockton once again to take my mom and Catherine to the airport in Sacramento for their trip to Florida. Then on Saturday, Jerm and I will work on my car and hopefully get a present for Alexa for her birthday party on Saturday night. I'm looking forward to the party, because it will give me an excuse to dress up and look pretty. Yay.
