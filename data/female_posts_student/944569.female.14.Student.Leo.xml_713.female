I'm so tired that i cant keep my eyes open because i have no strength to.  They are all slitty right now.   I'm so tired i floated lifelessly around the pool during my backstroke and i drank at least an eighth of the pool.  YAWN!  Gonna go take a nappy-nap.  Oh, wait.  I cant.  I ate dumplings meaning i cant sleep till i digest it fully otherwise i'll get fat.  *starts poking stomach* The reason why i'm saying weird things like nappy-nap and myummy and hungwy is because i dont want to be ordinary!  NEVER!  NEVER, SAYS I!  TAKE THAT ADAM!  MUAHAHAAAHHAHAHAHHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
