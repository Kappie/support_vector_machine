We didn't spend the whole day together but the time that we did spend together was great. He went to the resort with my mom, sister, brothers, my brother Anthony's girlfriend, and me. When we got there we played pool with my brothers and then my brothers and his girlfriend went down to the beach, we told them that we would meet them down there when we were done playing our game. We went down to the beach to watch the sunset, which I thought was really cute. However my stupid brother had to runin the moment by throwing a can at Kenny which pissed me off. They decided to get drunk at act stupid, but anyways. So we walked back up to the resort and went into the spa, where we had some more alone time. We talked about things, had quiet time. Then we got out went and took  our shower (not together), hung out some more. Then we went by the fire pit and sat with my mom, and my brother's girlfriend. Then we started home. We were in the, the very back seat, he held me in his arms and we sat there and stared into each others eyes. I love him soooo much, and to tell you the truth, what I am about to say I never thought I would say, at least not at this young of an age. I want to spend the rest of my life together with him, I wanna get married to him. I want what happened last night, to happen ever night. When I was down on the beach with him. I almost fell asleep in his arms watching the sun and I loved that moment I wanna spend the rest of my life falling asleep in his arms. He makes me happier then I ever thought I could be.
