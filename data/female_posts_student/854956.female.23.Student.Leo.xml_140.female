We went on Wednesday night and closed the deal.  By we, I mean my Dad and I.  We signed off on all the papers, and then I went to pick it up the next day.  So, Thursday night my Dad and I went to pick up the car and let them have my old one (because I traded it).  The Saturn people gave me a rose (pale pink, my favorite... I don't know HOW they knew that) and I got a tour of the building.  Whenever I take my car for anything, I can go to their workroom (if I have homework or something I need to work on) or I can watch TV (they have cable).  It was neat in a hoaky way.  Then the guy called over all the other Saturn employees to send me off.  They chanted this thing to me, and then I got to get in the car and take off!  It was a wonderful experience!  In about a week my plates should come in, and they're going to put them on for me.  They're also going to wash my car for me as well!  :-)  I'm just happy in general about my car and how everything turned out with it!      MADRIGAL DINNER    Saturday I drove to Austin because it was Melissa's last night in the Madrigal Dinner and I was going to attend.  She did an absolutely beautiful job in it, and I really enjoyed her singing to us at the table.  Everytime the wenches and all would go up to the stage to sing stuff, I could hear her beautiful voice ringing out.  :-)  I'm so very proud of her for trying out and doing all the Madrigal Dinner stuff, and I was very happy to hear she plans on doing it again next year!  :-)  WAY TO GO, MELISSA!    THANKSGIVING    Thanksgiving is this week... which means my dead days are already next Thurs/Fri!  OMG... this semester has FLOWN by!  Anyhow, I'm so glad it's the week of Thanksgiving... I only have my classes tomorrow, and then I'm done with classes for this week!!!  Tomorrow night Melissa is coming to town, and so is Jennifer.  Wednesday the three of us are going out to eat lunch.  I can't wait to spend time with the group again... I've missed it!  Although, I've been lucky enough to hang out with Melissa and the Austin people this semester... and this past weekend especially, I had a great time with Melissa!  I miss Jennifer, too, though.  I wish she had chosen to go to school here in TX.  Oh, well... she'll be done after this semester and will hopefully choose to move back to TX.  :-)  Okay, I'm done with this post... hope you enjoyed...!!!  :-D
