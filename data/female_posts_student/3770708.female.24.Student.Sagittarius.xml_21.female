I mercilessly threw out every remotely perishable item in the back of the cupboards, chucking out two garbage bags full of cake mixes, flour, granola bars, baby food, oatmeal, and pasta, among other food stuffs in various stages of decomposition. I smashed nests of roach eggs, I swept up their refuse, bleached away their pheromones, and chased them with a pair of tongs (didn't catch any, but scared them good).  After the downstairs bathroom had been filled with kitchen goods, I opened my paint cans and armed myself with rollers. Pale ivory went up on the cupboards, a mossy green on the wall. The brand of paint we used seems particularly creamy, with the appearance of melted ice cream. Vanilla and mint, it's all I can do to keep from licking the walls.  It would seem to be a simple task, painting a wall, but it isn't. We had to drag everything away so I could reach, and behind the couch, the shelves, and the computer desk, we found an astounding array of lost items and an entire archaeological site of ant refuse. It was astounding. And now, unwilling to shove all the garbage back under the furniture and stack the piles of old mail back on the wall shelves, I have committed my day to purging. Already, an enormous garbage bag of old mail and catalogs is sitting beside me, and the place looks remarkably less cluttered. A large pile of recycling towers beside the door, awaiting Mike's return with the car for a trip to the recycle bins. Mike and my mother have slipped down to Home Depot to buy another board for the new cupboards, and Mike intends to buy goodies at Costco while he's down there for his painting party at work tomorrow.   Gavin's Dream  Throughout all this, Gavin has amused himself with his Grannie, who can't inhale the paint fumes or she will fall over dead. She took the kiddo to the mall, and bought him an amazing substance which has excited him to no end: PlayDoh. We expected him to go nuts with it, but instead he sat quietly and poked it, rolled it between his fingers, and then busied himself with picking it off his hands. This kid hates having dirty hands.  Last night he had a nightmare, and cried piteously in his sleep. I rolled him over, rubbed his side, and cooed at him as he calmed down. He didn't wake up, but moaned grieviously, and whimpered, " 'tuck!"  Poor thing, I wonder where he was stuck.   The Very Stupid Man   When I modeled at WCC, there was always a man who stood out. For whatever reasons, when my eyes fell on him, I invariably thought  creep . The sort of man you wouldn't want to stand too near to you. Somehow, my auntie has seen fit to rent a room in her house to this man, and he came over yesterday to help my mother fix the truck. He came at nightfall, forcing them to work in the dark. He insisted she needed a jump, though she told him repeatedly that the battery was 3 days old and brand new. He insisted that a starter motor was the same as a solanoid. When the engine failed to turn on his first attempt to start it, he tried another 80 times before my mom told him to stop. He electrocuted himself once, tried to do so again by laying live jumper cables on the hood of the truck. My mother began to fear for his life in this effort as much as she feared for the truck. And he bragged. He would have been a famous rock star if people hadn't screwed him over. A famous artist. A great mechanic. He made none-too-subtle hints about money. Hoping to earn more money by stalling, he helped my mom carry the jack into the house, and promptly gouged one of my freshly painted walls. I stayed very still on the couch, hoping he wouldn't see me, but he did. He politely acknowledged his recognition of me by expounding on every detail he knew of my life, which was far more than I was comfortable with. My skin crawled as he pointed out how he had often seen me modeling. I thought to myself,  if ever I were to be raped or murdered, here is the suspect.    So for anyone who may be reading this journal of mine, be warned. If ever a grisly fate befalls me, you know who to point at first.
