He's going to Middle College forever, so he's removed from the total picture...no worries. Unless I keep running into him at the mall. But yah.  Whee everyone's in for Firehouse,  bonus ...well, a couple o' ya anywayz. I miss all of you already...*crying*.  So anyways Lindseyreid (intentional spelling), Nosy-Rosie-Posie-Tao-Tao-LilChi-Jiang, Z, Will, Brittany (if you're on), and all of the wonderful viewers of this establishment...HAVE AN EXCELLENT DAY!
