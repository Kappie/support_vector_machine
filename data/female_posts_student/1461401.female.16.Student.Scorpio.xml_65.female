Whenever she needs me she always ends up screaming her head off just to get me to turn around. But that's why I listen to my music so loud. So I can't hear her screaming. So much fighting at my house, I get sick of it. We're not a disfunctional family or anything, we all love eachother very much, and know it...but there's always those little things that get in the way. The little things that make us scream our heads off and make the children cry. Mom says I listen to my music too loud, but that doesn't matter. I can't hear her say it anyway.
