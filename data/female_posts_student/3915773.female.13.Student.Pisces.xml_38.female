Medco who already serves about 60 million people didn't begin advertising to gain clients, or inform people that despite federal scrutiny their services are above all else. Their first ad which appeared in the The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal is simple and informative about the company. As Mr. Smith of Gothem, the company's head ofmarketing,stated,"These are introductory ads."   Despite this company's ridicule by federal organizations, I have to say that they are using the media in a very effective way. Instead of being hounded with prescription ads that say they have the best prices anywhere, this ad seems not pressuring.I think the company has the right idea about making ads more informative. As I looked at the ad it seemed more like a brochure about the company than an ad to getyou touse them as your pharmacy benefit manager. The company seems to want to establish a connection with the public about their company which many aren't familiar with. Honestly I would hope that more companies take this approach rather than making an ad that seems like all the company is after is your money. By sending this new message through and ad I feel the company will get a lot of praise. Also itcan expect an increase of clients. It just goes to show that the conventional way of reaching people won't alwayswork.
