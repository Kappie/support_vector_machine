Yeah, maybe because he can zoom across the screen really fast in th game and slide quickly on the ground......still, the face doesnt look like Zero....Zero has a angry-ish face..oh wait, it's sort of angry but not really....Well, i'm sure the other one is Megaman for no other character wears the ridiculous blue suit and helmet [ >P blech!]  Actually, Zero would look like Protoman if you put sunglasses and a scarf on him.........hm....Megaman's Japanese name is Rockman....lots of weird names for the characters...most of them end with man...that's so sexist.......  Characters' names ending with man:  Megaman                                                                      Skullman Protoman [aka Blues in Japanese]                               Snakeman Gutsman                                                                        Stoneman Colorman                                                                      Thunderman Bomberman [coincidence?  i think NOT]                       Toadman Cutman                                                                         Woodman Elecman                                                                        Kingman Fireman Freezeman Heatman Knightman Leagueman Magicman Shadowman Sharkman [Whew, that's all i can find for now...]
