(i believe i averaged 4 hours of sleep a night, that week.)  but from somewhere came that chipper person buried deep inside of me, to convince the ticket agent that we could stay in minneapolis overnight, keep our regular ticket, and fly out early in the morning to california.  after a stressful time, calling everyone in our party that we weren't going to be on the airplane as scheduled (3 groups of people from 3 different places were all going to meet up on the same airplane to california.)  and there is a certain amount of hell we received from the hotel industry, when trying to change the reserved name over to the name of someone who'd actually be in california that night.  stand-by was our only hope.   stand-by to minneapolis worked in the computers, but we'd have to later beg our way onto the stand-by list to california a day later.  thankfully the stand-by gods were smiling at us.
