I just spend the last 30 minutes of my life organizing my away messages for AIM. Do you realize how lame that is? I have like 40, so I went though and capitolized all the names, added some proper grammar and rewrote alot of them. Noone should have time to do something like that. Before that I organized my buddy list catagories, because I had 8 folders.   Speaking of organization, my mom has been on my case about it. My room mainly. Last week she had an interventine with me because my room "smelled" as she put it. I told her to get off my case because my room was fine and that the smell was coming from me, and then she asked me when the last time I took a shower was and well... you know what I was doing for the next 30 minutes. As it turns out we were both right. The room still smelled.  Last month she approached me about organizers. She said "If you clean up your room  really  nice, I'll buy you a closet organizer!". She made it sound all sparkly like candy, but I knew it was a trick. Closet organizers arn't   fun  ! It's like when you have to give your dog a pill, you act like its really a treat and by the time they down it they don't care if they've been had. So I didn't. Then one morning she wakes me up at the crack of noon and says "put pants on were going to home depot and buying closet organizers." See? It's like a game of chicken of who's lazyer, and im a pro.  Don't expect any late night entries after school starts. I just won't be on. I'm waking up at 7 every day of the week with expection of saturday maybe... this isn't from will power, but from the fact that M-W-F I go exercising with my dad and his  personal trainer , and T-Th I have classes and such.   This year will be grand. I'm on a regular exercise program, I have a light class load (of music), im taking private voice and guitar lessons, writing on my novel and working on my band pipe-dream, and I have a job.... er... sort of. I'm going to ask to help me make a picture story/tour of my typical janitor shift... I'd post it here, and it'd be awesome.   p.s. trish thx for the HTML thing, im getting it work the way I want thx to JOSH! thx JOSH!

I thought to myself, this isn't going to work.' - Paddy Delaney, Doorman
