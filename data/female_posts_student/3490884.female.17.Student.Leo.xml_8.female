I told you so.  To you, I just have to say you are a pretty oblivious and often times dumb person. I see that your eyes are closed now, and I don't care to try to open them for you. You can do whatever you'd like from now on. It's no longer my concern. When you show up again, don't be surprised if I'm not around. If I am around, then don't be surprised if I'm not the same person. If you don't know who you are, I'm again not surprised. Like I said, you're oblivious and often times dumb. I guess you'll figure it out eventually and when you do, it'll probably be because I'll be gone and you'll wonder why.  Don't wonder why. Just think back to everything that's gone on and then remember a yearbook message. Yes, you should feel dumb once you figure out the puzzle like I just did. You tried so hard to confuse me, but I'm a smart girl, remember?   Yes, I'm a smart girl, so I'm done doing stupid things like...um...hanging out with the likes of you. I'm done.   But I'm really not bitter. I would actually like to thank you. Now, I won't waste more of my time.   Funny puzzle. It's solved now, so don't worry about it. I understand the course of events and I'm not bitter. Thanks.
