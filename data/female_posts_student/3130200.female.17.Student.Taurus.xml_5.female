I was very reluctant to see it because of all the controversy surrounding it and the words propaganda and what not being thrown around.I would consider my self a solid democrat, not overly conservative or overly radical...and this movie scared the hell out of me.To think that a man who puts his business relationships on a higher level than the well-being of a nation is running this country makes me ill. How did this joker get in the White House?  In my humble opinion, America was doomed from nearly the beginning of this dear country. America was an experiment. Can people control themselves enough to rule themselves? The 55 delegates put forth an idea of "republicanism." Making man not evil by making him think they are important and have power. The Constitution was written not to take power, not to stop the radical idea of the Declaration of Independence, but to insure them. It reflects the fear of "evil" men. Ex. State representatives, the federal system, a two house congress, the Electoral College, the elastic clause (art. I, sect 8, cl. 18), and state legislatures picking senators. This was all designed to instill in man a sense of power while in reality giving none. So, what does this have to do with Iraq and the War you ask?  Well, our fore-fathers took a huge risk. Nobody has made a republic work for very long. First, they had to instill virtues: honesty, integrity, self reliance, and hard work to name a few. However, republics fail because people have a human desire called greed. On the same level, republics work because of the "I have to take care of myself but also acknowledge my fellow man" mentality. To insure the success of said republic, one must avoid apathy, fear, and greed. Ok, that said, I want you to now understand why I think America was doomedto experience an event like September 11th. I'm going to jump ahead a little to what is going on right now though.   Why I think September 11th and other similar events occurred, and will occur in the future.   The answer is plain and straightforward. America is hated in the Arab world. This has been debated over and over again in the media. The question is why do Islamic, Arabic, and Middle Eastern people hate our great country so much? Why is all of our well meaning intent facing the wall of rejection? The answer is out there, but in this time of political correctness nobody dares to utter it. It is the old adage of "the friend of my enemy is my enemy" that works here. And let me remind you that seven Arab countries surrounding Israel fought at least 7 wars against the Jewish state. They still proclaim their goal to be the destruction of the state of Israel. And it is America's complete support of Israel that ensures the country is not wiped off the maps. On one hand, Am. should be praised for being a big brother to Israel and protecting it from bully states. On the other, it can only do so fairly and evenhandedly in respect to Palestinian Arabs, who are an inseparable part of the deal that created Israel.  Irresponsible foreign policies of the Bush Administration, endorsing Israeli aggression and land grabs not only encourage Israel but cause great outrage in the whole Arab world, brewing terrorism and endangering Americans at home and abroad. To us, democracy is the extension of the work of the Founding fathers and centuries-long tradition; to Arabs, democracy is the extension of the order established and revered in the Jewish state. The more words Zionist and American go together in the minds of Middle Eastern people, the more loathing reserved for the former would be poured into us. As outraged as I was with the recent barbaric beheadings of American citizens in Iraq, I have to bring them here as an example of the hatred we are facing.Their aggression represents everything we have imposed, changed, or destroyed in their civilization.  Basically what we do is take countries and send infinite amounts of corporate advisors, giving them advice on how to run their economic systems more efficiently. We inundate them with ourmedia, plugging them with the same MTV and commercials via satellite that we as a culture are so complacent to swallow. We tell them that they are inadequate unless they have some guy's name on their underwear, shoes, sunglasses, and cars. Then we try to re-vamp their economy. Sure, we make it a lot more efficient, but in that same breath we spread our Taco Bells, McDonald's, shopping malls, and fashion sense all over them. People cheer when a KFC goes in the middle of Tiananmen Square because they are one step closer to being complete, one step closer to the American Dream of materialistic completion that we tell ourselves we can't live without.  We homogenize countries to make them more accessible for world trade. Globalization. You can't just blame terrorism on religious fanatical zeal alone. THEY BOMBED THE ECONOMIC PULSE OF THE WORLD. The Thai baht crashed the same time our NASDAQ crashed. We interlinked each other and became interdependent.In the process, we squandered Asian culture in an effort to have their damn economy mirror ours.  Ok, so I think I have thoroughly confused myself as well as my faithful readers (see: none). I will with hold any further comments to allot time for information absorption and dissection.I will come back to the point of republicanism tomorrow night. I promise.
