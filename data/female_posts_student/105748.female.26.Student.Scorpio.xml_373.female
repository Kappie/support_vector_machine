DAF: I've seen all of the movies that you listed except for  Moulin Rouge , which for some reason or other Brian has no desire to watch.  I, on the other hand, am a major Nicole Kidman fan.  I'm anxious to see it.  Perhaps I'll be able to convince Brian to rent it one day.  We've got that rent-one-get-one-free deal at Hollywood Videos through the 15th of May, anyhow.  I loved  Bridget Jones Diary  (very funny) and  Rock Star  (nostalgic)..  Ice Age  was okay.  I didn't think it was nearly as good as  Shrek .   Tailor of Panama  was alright.  It put Brian to sleep.  I actually stayed awake through the whole thing, but despite the merits of the story the movie had slowed down considerably at certain parts.  I didn't find it as enjoyable as other similar Pierce Brosnan (spelling?) movies.    By the way, in the process of installing chat, I came across a free web upload utility so I'm pleased to announce that Golden Sushi now boasts web upload compatibility!  Hip! Hip! Hurrah!  You won't need not install WS_FTP or CuteFTP.. You just need to click on the link and voila!  Instant upload capability!  Whooppee!
