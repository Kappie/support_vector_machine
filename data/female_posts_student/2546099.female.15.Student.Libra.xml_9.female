They r very annoying. Well mainly my Grandmother.All they do is watch the cricket, even tho we have pay tv and then they fall asleep but no1 can change da channel. They complain that they r hungry but dont get up and help wit tea or lunch or nething. Mums been quite bitchy bcoz they r here, which is annoying. Im bored out of my mind, so bored that i cleaned my room last nite. I cant wait til saturday coz they go home then.  Neways on 2 betta things... mum, dad and i mite be going 2 torquay next week 4 a couple of nites! Its gonna be gd, afta chrissy sales at heaps of surf shops. I love shopping!!! lol. Well this has been a very pointless blog. I really wish i was intelligent so that i could write sumthing worth reading. Neways perhaps i will write sumthing more interesting 2moro.
