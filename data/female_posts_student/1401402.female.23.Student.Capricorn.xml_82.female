Once again I'm sitting all alone, hoping one day you will come to me. I can see you in my mind. Its been a while since i felt this way. Emotions when I think of you.   Here in the night like an angel while i'm sleeping, I feel your arms around me but sadly I'm just dreaming. I star into the darkness and hope to find you waiting, but I know that its useless, I'm just hallucinating. Tell me why cant I stop thinking of you.   What I wrote were only songs that reminds me of someone that has been on my mind for zzzzzdayzzzzz. I'll let you know more when I know for sure what is going on.  Cang Hai Mang Mang sent me this poem which fits perfectly into my situation tonight.  Thanks Cang!!!   I Don't Know You Anymore  I would like to visit you for a while, get away and out of this city, maybe I shouldn't have called, but someone had to be the first to break... We can go sit on your back porch, relax, talk about anything... It don't matter!!! I'll be courageous if you can pretend that you've forgiven me... Because I don't know you anymore... I don't recognize this place, the picture frames have changed and so has your name... We don't talk much anymore, we keep running from the pain but what I wouldn't give to see your face again...  Lost without your love  Lost and all alone, I always thought that I could make it on my own... Since you left I hardly make it through the day... My tears get in the way... And I need you back to stay...  I wander through the night... And search the world to find the words to make it right... All I want is just the way it used to be... With you here close to me, I've got to make you see.  That I'm lost without your love... Life without you isn't worth the trouble of I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel... A touch without a feel I can't believe it's real... And someday soon I'll wake. And find my heart won't have to break...  Yes I'm lost without your love...Life without you isn't worth the trouble of...All I want is just the way it used to be I need you here with me...Oh darlin' can't you see...If we had love before...We can have it back once more...
