A time of Boredom, Insomnia, Fights, and tears. I can't wait!  I know, I know..I do need this break. I need it to take time from everyone who's been driving me up the wall the past 5 months. I dont think I have anymore wall to go up with out reaching the ceiling. New Years Eve will be fun though. Sarah and I are going to go to the Section 8 show to go and see Fall From Between. Fall From Between hit Brookfield like a new boy band hits TRL. All of a sudden everyone was a emo indie kid! How amazing! Now, dont take this the wrong way, they are a pretty jazzy get together, but when everyone and there grandma are so emo-licious it gets kind of overrated.  I want to go back to New York City. That was ah-mazing. The people, the sights, it makes me feel all stuffed up and cloggy inside! Or maybe thats because I got sick again from it. Tonsilitius, Pink Eye, Ear Infecton, oh yeah i got it all. If anyone wants to be sick and miss some school, call me. I wish I had someone I could talk to. Someone I could spill my heart out to, and they would listen. I dont have anyone like that. No one will listen to me. There too self absorbed to give a damn about me. It really makes me angry, but theres nothing I can do about it. Im not a mean person. As much as everyone tells me that I dont "have" to be nice to people I just can't help it. And with that, people just walk all over me and use me as a welcome mat for there problems. Maybe thats what I can attempt to change over break. Im not going to be so willing to listen. Maybe then they will all get the hint. Just maybe. Oh well. It's not like I have a choice. I just dont care anymore.
