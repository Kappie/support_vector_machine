( being from LA, driving under 70mph is just ungodly slow ) and i got a great deal on it.  in any case, i feel alive... like a phoenix -- hence the title of this post. it also coincides with the fact that the car's color is named: phoenix yellow. but imagine a mustard yellow, shiny and sleek.    //links: auto trader-/  urlLink http://www.autotrader.com
