It has a pool table and stereo and that sort of thing.  It is away though, and that makes all the difference.  People come and crash and talk and connect and cook together and read together and sleep in the same room with a friend and it is always refreshing and wonderful.  Good good.  This will be a brief update, but I start my new job tomorrow, and I am in a good place for it.  Did you know that the universe is full of suprises?  I did, but it hit home this weekend in a different way.  Interesting.  Peace...
