Felt like re-posting this:  I’m finally content and now I understand My life is becoming so clear It’s like I’m finally able to see the light On the path once carved in fear.  A burden has lifted from my tired back And this feeling is all so great I’m learning now I can trust and love Rather than loathe and hate.  I’ve taken my chances in the game of life I’ve bet everything I can And for a moment it seemed that I’d lost it all But now I’m winning again.  Now I stand in the dawn of a brand new day And I watch the sun rise with a smile The light bathes my soul, and uncovers a heart That I haven’t seen for a while.    Well, not a whole lot to say. Adios.
