(about an hour before this, we figured out a person can only die one time.... -__-;;)  gosh.  now I'm so freakishly tired and my brain hurts.  too much planning...  jack finally figured out that I like to make things complicated.  **COFF  poor dear.  anyhow.  he's going to toronto next weekend (for no apparent reason, it seems) and he refuses to work on his birthday, so I'm going over tuesday and thursday.  joy.  ++sunny
