See, our pastor is in Indonesia on a mission trip so we have all the other pastor people preaching and they aren't as good as Pastor Matt. Today we had the junior high pastor speak. He  spoke  about tempations and suchw which on a normal day I would have liked  a lot  but I am in just  a bad mood today.  On  these  days  I need the most of God but its hardest to listen.  Today Jacob took Matt and I to Baja Fresh and I got the SUPER TASTY chicken tacos and they come wraped in foil. For some reason I remembered a couple  years ago  how I promised that if  I  ever got braces I would have to chew foil to see what it felt  like ! Hahahhahaha! But I was way to scared so I just sucked on the  foil.  Hahahha!! It felt so weird!!   it kinda hurt...
