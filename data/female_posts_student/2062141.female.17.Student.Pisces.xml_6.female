I was kinda disappointed, we didn't get to go Seattle... instead we just took the bus to Factoria and ate at Red Robin and I ate waaay too much today I just realized. Anyway, we were at my house for like 7 hours and yeah. Did nothin'. I wanted to go to Seattle! Oh well. I feel weird right now. I'm not sure. I'm just not in a good mood but I don't know why. Josh! I was soo sad you couldn't come with us!!! I missed you! Oo oo we thought of a nickname for you! FRUIT-PIE!!!! Hoooray! See, you were in our hearts. HA HA HA John Mayer just said that he measured his penis with his trapper keeper!!! (I'm watching The 80s Strike Back). Oh hahaha that's great. I have a feeling he and Nick would get along. Sorry. I'm multi-tasking. Annnnywho...   I was so happy, everybody liked my drawing for the Alice In Wonderland poster... I think those'll be up sometime next week (if I finish by Friday). So that's good. I thought it sucked, but now I feel better about it. But yeah I'm in a horrible horrible mood now.I think I'll use Josh's method and talk about people by using aliases. So yeah, my mom asked me if me and Ricky Ricardo are just friends. I hate it when my mom says dumb stuff like that, and it pissed me off because it's TOTALLY and UTTERLY plutonic. You can't get more plutonic. There can't be any less attraction there. God that pissed me off. My parents are soo stupid about that stuff with me. Okay Mallorie has a boyfriend. And I just want to hang out with my friends and they have to question why. I mean there was period where I hung out with, oh let's call him Mr. Pig, for a period of less than a month. It was very hard to hang out with Mr. Pig without questioning and whatnot, so I would just "hang at charlotte's" for a few hours. And for what. I don't know. That's why he's Mr Pig. And what is wrong with me? Not to sound cliche, but why can't I find a guy? A good guy. I thought he was. But he was just Mr Pig after all. I always give people the benefit of the doubt. Yeah I should stop doing that.   Oh look Mr. Pig, you get your own picture! Don't you feel like a big man. Maybe you should go shit on someone else's feelings for a while.
