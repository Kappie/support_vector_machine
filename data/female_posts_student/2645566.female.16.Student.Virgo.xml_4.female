Why do I have to loose someone so close to my heart? If he hadn't had that seizure, he wouldn't have broken his hip. It wouldn't have resulted in this mess.   He can't swallow anymore. They are keeping him hydrated through an i.v. His living will demands that a feeding tube not enter his system. The doctors diagnosed that we will loose our loved one in a matter of no more than a month.   I hate not being there for my grandma...I hate not being there for my great-grandma. I hate not being there for my Grandpa Fred who only has limited time left on this world.   There will be no funeral. Grandpa Fred will be cremated and his ashes will be spread at sea. They are going to try to spread his ashes at the same longitude/latitude that they spread my aunt from. I love my grandpa. I wish I was there.    Another soul was lost yesterday. Dustin...Deborah's son. Family friends. Dustin shot himself in the head earlier Saturday morning. It's horrible...he was trying to sell that very gun one day prior. He was only 16. That's my age for goodness sakes.   In closing: This is a cruel and hateful world that we call home.
