Okay, so we didn't exactly know where we were going, but we went on an adventure today. It was very spur of the moment and haha fun. We figured out how long the bus rides are from here to there. Anyway enough jabbering... I really need to learn how to tell stories.   Anyway at Southgate Sondy, Whitney and I were going to go home and like well do movie night on a weekday. So we are waiting for the bus and haha the 9Northgate just happens to be sitting in front of us. One of the cool "slinky" buses. Anyway we're like "let go for a ride on the bus, it'll be an adventure!" So yeh we went ona ride. So we're just sitting there on the bus at southgate waiting for our adventure to begin, still debating, but for sure going to go on a long neededadventure that summer school had postponed. So the bus leaves the terminal and Sondra's like "Are you sure you want to go on this?" and we both pointed out that it was her idea. So we're going on an adventure. "Wow this bus is really long!"   Not only was the bus long, we were going through downtown when we started to get bored. Yeh, when people say that this is a long bus ride... Believe them. We get to Kingsway garden mall and we had a chance to get off and go home, but we didn't for some strange reason. so we're going along still... still riding the nine. and then we get to northgate finally after watchin what type of people got on to the bus. yeh there were alot of people all shapes and SIZES! (Bad thought, bad thought! Mind caving in.. Oh no!) Yeh so we get to Northgate and by this time... lunch has had a little time to sit in our stomachs and nature calls. So we get into Northgate Center... And the thing is like... DEAD! So we are aimlessly wandering around the mall that is full of pretty much just air looking for a washroom. We walked all the way from one end to another looking for a food court, because food courts always have washrooms. Well we didn't find one. Luckily we found a "mall directory." You know what wefound out? The Food court is on the Upper Level... and there's only one washroom!GAH! It was... Well unbelievable... So an empty mall with a food court upstairs and 1 washroom. Though the washroom was quite nice.   We left after that. And we took the 12... Which is just like the 30. The longest most pointless bus ride in the world.. At least the 30 goes places that are like... in need of buses where as the 12 is like... Empty residential areas. Anyway we eventually got home... 4 hours after we got out of school. yeh - great stuff hey?
