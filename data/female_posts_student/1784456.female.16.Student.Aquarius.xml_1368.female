Well... they've got virtually everything for sale! *clueless* Aaargh, my head hurts! Geez isn't it static? (When you're hair all goes paton) Mmm, I'm sure everyone understood that! Well, I'm back at school... and life's gonna start to drag again *sigh* why does it have to drag? (More like scrape) Why can't it roll or.. erm... slide? It just kind of gets to a point where it's like ...why bother? Well, I'm not quite sure what I'm going on about *side affects of head ache* So I better quit while I'm not there. Sorry... everything seems so pointless at the moment. :( Bleurgh, I hate feeling like this! I'm gonna go... go... sleep! Yeah!  I feel like I'm going crazy, I don't breathe enough. And yet all the time, I think too much. Why is it that I think through life, And don't live it? I am walking through this life, Outside my body but inside my face. Living in fear, Of all my mistakes. Waiting for the past and the future, To colide into one. Waiting for them to crush me. Wondering what I have done.
