It was fun though.Next week is my last week ill be able to see everyone before I leave. Im excited to be going but really sad that I wont be able to spend the better part of my summer with my friends. I havent seen my best friend, Heather in a year and usually summers are our time to be inseperable but since my dad moved i dont get to see her! I guess ill just make the most of it and ill be writting everyone and sending pictuers whenever possible. Ive got to go get my sisters birthday present here soon and a couple of books for me to read on the plane. Okay im depressed now, lol j/k.  Kay*la
