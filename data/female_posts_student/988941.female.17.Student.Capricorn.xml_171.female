I know talking about war etc.. isn't happy but it is now and it is to do with us, with our generation. If we all posted everyday going on 'o wasn't this lesson wonderful, I learnt so much! Lunch was funny' etc... then it would be so boring! And I mean BORING. Whereas at least with this we can also have a good debate and not just a silly argument. Now where is Jackie, I want her posting, she always makes me giggle...
