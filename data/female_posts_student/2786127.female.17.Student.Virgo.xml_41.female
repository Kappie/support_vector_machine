I'm not but even if I was, nate has it coming to him.   I went dress shopping with Lindsay Andrysiak and Makenzie today. It made me like lindsay alot more, and I've decided that she actually is pretty cool. I was being all depressed and in a bad mood at the end of the day because i'm a *fat ass* and all the dresses looked like shit on me, and she reassured me that they didnt and that I wasn't trash. And she was being nice about it. hmm. strange.  I'm sitting at a desktop containing a bottle of water, an empty can of pop, a half full glass of milk, a tube if "strawberry" lipgloss, makenzies cell phone, misselaneous(?) crumbs, a few art books, a bottle of white nail polish and a notepad with the begginings of a playlist on it and random scribbles of stars. As well as other things. I need to clean. My dad gave me 200 buck a roos for dress shopping, but he's withholding a whole 100 until i clean the whole damn house this weekend.  I'm so disgusting. I dress like trash and do a great job of really working the part too. I need summer to be here so i can get my Y pass and so i have volleyball workouts at Centennial...I'm going to work out everyday for hours until I look awesome. God that'll take forever.  I freaked out today. I freaked out hard core after shopping...  PukE>    I've got a day and a reason why I should not believe in anything anymore,What's this for? My time well spent I've got all these memories that I cannot believe in  Cause I don't know where I've been all these years All these years And do you know this reason I hope that you can see it cause I will not give up  And we all know what you've done again I can see right through you You're making your way over again..again -::.The Early November.::
