WTF? i meen i feel shitty just cause i don't think he gives a fuck 'bout me.. but i wonder how meggan feels if he told her he liked her n' change all of a sudden!:S well u know what! i don't care n'e more..i'm not gonna put n'e effort into makin' somethin' with guys! i'll let them come to me!( although no guy ever does like me )... i'm tired of always hurtin'...i'm tired of always bein' the one who isn't happy.. i want what marie n' justin have ( xcept not with justin he's maries!lol..) but i want someone who will be there for me n' make me happy...but thats not gonna happen n'e time soon now is it!:S i'm never the lucky one! must be somethin' wrong with me... i don't know what to do n'e more..i'm soo lost n' confused in all of this... those who know 'bout my past relationships know that i've gone out with total idiots... who didn't give a shit 'bout me... i'm tired of those relationships...there just dead ends... i want better for myself..n' i want to become a better person...   xXx
