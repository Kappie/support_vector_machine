Say those words to me again  so I may hear, so I may know  what it is about the rain.    why does mere rain frighten you so?  is it because of the clouds, so low?  say it louder, let me hear.  so the sun may shine and glow.    tell me why do raindrops scare you?  what is it about a sky unblue?  I'll open the window and let in the rain  for I do not fear it as you now do.    So I opened the door and in came the rain  burning the flesh and scorching the skin,  if only you had said it louder,  but now you'll never say it again.
