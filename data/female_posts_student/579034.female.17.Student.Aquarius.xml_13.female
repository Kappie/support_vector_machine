My luck, Ice Age didn't work for some odd reason, so I ended up watching Snow Dogs. I feel asleep during the second showing of it and I woke up at one. My dad took me out driving thow so that was cool. I got a little nervous though cause someone was behind me and I dunno, I felt like "AH!". But, I did good, he let me park and everything (lol). I went into East Hampton too, I got Mariana and Claire something for thier birthdays. Ha ha I'm not saying what they waye just in case they read this. I feel oh-so smart hee hee. Any way, we have dinner reservations at this place called The Laundry, hope its not too DRY... ha ha get it... Laundry, dry-cleaning... okay yea I know bad joke. Talk to you later!
