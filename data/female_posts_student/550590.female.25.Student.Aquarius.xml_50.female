God, I'm exhausted--and I shouldn't be--I really didn't do much if anything this weekend.  I think Mom said it best: I get sleepy when I'm bored.  Watched Hearts in Atlantis and The Fast and the Furious this weekend.  The first was as good as to be expected--Anthony Hopkins is amazing.  I would want to have his children if he weren't halfway in his grave.  The latter didn't have much in the way of substance--kind of like Point Break meets Gone In 60 Seconds, but it was fun to look at.  I love beautiful men.  Rawwwwr.  This afternoon I went to Elyse's house to discuss wedding stuff and get the third degree about the job hunt from others there.  It was a little annoying, but added to my motivation to get the hell out of Florida asap.  Everyone seems to think I'm nuts for wanting to live somewhere with seasons and cold weather.  Florida has just been such a disappointment in so many aspects: I really think a chance of location is long overdue at this point.  Well, I'm off to apply for more jobs, seeing as I've promised my dad I wouldn't bank on the Pennsylvania thing and I'm a little skeptical of living so close to the Amish...(sp?)  Well, only God knows.  Just keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I keep you all in mine.
