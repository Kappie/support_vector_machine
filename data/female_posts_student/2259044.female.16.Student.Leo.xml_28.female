This is about what God has planned for u.  u guys don't even see it, i mean it's right in front of u. everything. everything around u everything u see, do, hear, smell, think, taste...everything.  how can u sit there in ur biology/science classes and see how perfectly everything works together, how each thing was created perfectly, how can u see that and not believe that there's something more? u must think about it...u have to care...sure this is "your life" u can live it however u want if u darn well please, but you'll never find what your looking for, i guarentee it.. all you girls that search for love and affection and protection and security in guys, all you guys that try to be tough and buff and macho, never showing emotions, never being serious....your missing the point, God doesn't care if u weigh 75 or 280, he loves you, his love is unconditional, that means he doesn't care what you've done, or how you've lived, that doesn't matter, he loves you anyway he will forgive u, he will let u start all over again, his love is forever. everyone screws up, some worse than others, in the worlds eyes, but no one screws up enuf not to recieve grace....yea, grace, that's "unmerited favor" that means it's wonderful gift that u recieve that u don't deserve, that isn't based on what u do or the things you've done, it's a free gift, and it's the gift of life, and you can't buy this gift and u don't deserve it, no one does, but u can recieve it, all you have to do is ask, it's your choice it's your decision.  you can't find this love anywhere else u no that..u can't...not in your looks, not in your relationships, not in your achievments, not in alchohol or drugs, not w/ur friends, not w/ur family, nowhere! except w/God. and he gives it out, to everyone, everyday, every second, for free! all you have to do is ask! changedfish
