You must rest." Tittanya nodded gently in reply. Though she disagreed with his logic, she dared not object. Her curiousity silenced her. "Tittanya," Damien began, "you once said that your vendetta with Marion must cease- that only one could survive." He paused to allow Tittanya time to drink it in. "In the bar..." "Yes. It is not a simple matter," he continued, sighing. "Everything has spiralled out of control because I intervened. Do not ask how, but you and Marion  must  have a   Final Fight, else anarchy ensue. One of you- and I sincerely hope it to be Marion- must die in the hands of the other." These words reminded Tittanya, who shot up like a bolt of lightning. "Marion's still in danger!" she exclaimed. "She will not die yet." Damien's words were so plain and emotionless, raising a slight fury in Tittanya. "what's that supposed to mean?" she questioned. "We need to rescue her now! You said yourself that she musn't die yet." "I only want you to be fresh for your battle against her. I will save her when she is nearing death," he promised. "Then you can finish her off easily." "Can you really risk that? What if you're too late?" At that exact moment, Marion's shrill voice could be heard worlds away. It was a cry fer help.
