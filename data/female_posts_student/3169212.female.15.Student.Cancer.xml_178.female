And you have somewhat contradicted yourself by saying that it is OK for CJ to drink beer, savvy?  They both do the same thing!   Elizabeth:  Jack does have a point.   CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  CAPTAIN, love.   Elizabeth:  Whatever.  And on Jacks behalf he is not an uncivilized being.  He dosent kill without a good reason.  He saved Will and I in a very smart manner.  He is human, like the rest of us and he makes mistakes, just more than the rest of us.  I am calling off the vote for rum.  Plus, if Jack dosent talk about rum how else are all these fun conversations going to start.   CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:   She finally sides with me *breaks into song* hallelujah, hallelujah _____   Elizabeth:  I can recant my words in a second, Sparrow  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Shuting up, love ^_^
