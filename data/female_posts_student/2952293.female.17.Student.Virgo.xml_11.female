But as always, I don't want to go to Easton, so I made Elizabeth swear to my cat that over spring break she'd learn how to drive to Lennox, and he approved her request by meowing.  I really hate Lizzie McGuire, but I really like Lindsey Lohan. So we go to see Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT SEE THAT MOVIE. The music is SHIT. If I have to hear that "Uh oh..." song one more time... THEY PLAYED IT 7,000 TIMES IN ONE MOVIE! It was the worst acting and the worst script ever! Earlier, it was really gross, because I decided that since Simple Plan is in that new Olsen twin movie, and they're apparently friends with Lizzie McGuire (who sucks balls, but not Aaron Carter's cause he's a wimp) (p.s. I used to love all the carter boys!), I've decided that Simple Plan is made of several petifiles. Anyways, the movie was getting really bad, and then who do they play... jesus are they in every movie about a young girl- CREEPY! So this guy comes into the movie with this little girl (I know with my previous statement, this seems to be bad, but it was just his daughter) and he tells me that he dropped his wallet and starts digging around for it near me. Then they sit down, next to us, out of an entire empty theater. But then they left, but in their place several gangs walked in. It was really weird. The movie kept getting worse and worse, and so did my anger. I shouted out a lot of random obscenities, such as "I'm going to jump into the screen and snap your neck!" There were some kids there, but they could take it. In the last 10 minutes, a whole group of people walk in and go into the row behind us, with their coats dangling over the seats, smacking us in the face. The ending was really predictable and it was just such a shitty movie, we didn't wait for the credits, we just left. We ran to our cars, cause that movie sucked balls. Bye!
