Everyone's body is different and everyone needs different things for them to lose weight.  I dunno why we all have to talk aobut it so much.  I say we all just do what we gotta and get skinny and cute!  Its just the winter blahs kicking in and making everyone hide under their sweaters.  Pounds are always added on in the Winter, its just a fact of life.  Once the warm weather rolls around we'll all be feeling better about ourselves.    Superbowl is on right now.  It sucks.  Well its good that Tampa Bay is winning, but so far: commercials SUCK and the halftime dealy with sting and no doubt and a lip syncing Shania Twain was poop on parade.
