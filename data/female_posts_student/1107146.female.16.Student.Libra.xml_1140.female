Also considering what we were walking in with.....only 2 people that did improv before (compare that with Franklin that has done it with the SAME team ever since middle school) we did really well. We have an awesome team that will get even better. We know how to work with each other now we need to concentrate on how to work well under pressure which only putting ourselves under pressure will help. The experience will tell you how awful we can get. Now we get to look to better things. Cheer up all. I luv you all even though I act like I'm going to kill some of you most of the time. =). Congrats on living through State.
