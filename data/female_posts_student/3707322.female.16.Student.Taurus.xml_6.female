I can go hiking or running or sailing or swimming or kayaking, etc. It's just the whole, being-stuck-up-here-with-just-my-family factor. Oh well. I should start my AP homework soon. Some people think that it's kind of a pain to have so much work over the summer, but I don't really mind. It keeps my mind occupied, so then I don't have such a big transition when school starts again. Besides, I read history books for fun anyway, so if I didn't have to read my textbook I would be reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or Undaunted Courage. I think it is safe to say that history is my passion. I love it. I think that it is essential to understand the past in order to fully understand the present. History tends to move in patterns and waves and repeat itself. Not exactly, but the sae kinds of things happen over and over. So by looking back and seeing how people conducted themsleves in the past, we can see what works and what doesn't and learn from thier experiances. By studying the mistakes and successesof others we can in turn make ourselves better people and our society run smoother and more effieciently. Alright, I kinda lost steam there. I took a bit of a break to watch part of Back to the Future II. And now I'm going to go watch the rest of it.  Over and Out
