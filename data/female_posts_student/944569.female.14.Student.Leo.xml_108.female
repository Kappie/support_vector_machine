Yippee!  I do admit i dont want to grow up.  I just get the feeling i want to stay 12 forever.  I don't want to become a teenager...I just don't think i'm ready for that kind of responsibility.  I have lived for such a short time but i now have so many memories and some of the things i do seem so big for me.  When i'm older, i'll have more memories and bigger responsibilities.  I have had the chance to live to this point and see how the world works.  How fairy tales don't just come from daydreaming.  Each year brings a fruitful crop of memories.  Farewell, child.  Will my thoughts be different when i am older?  I dont know.  That's why i want to record them as soon as possible......      Happy Birthday   Happy Birthday to me..... Happy Birthday to me..... Happy Birthday to meeee..... Happy Birthday to me.....
