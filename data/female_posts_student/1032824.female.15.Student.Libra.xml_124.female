Honestly speaking, although we were rather disappointed that we did not come in 1st, we accepted the results quickly, because our competitors, Christine, Jiamin and Selina really kicked out butts! I ain't kidding, they were much better than us in terms of vocals.. but of course, our creativity is better than anyone else la.. multi-racial somemore! Teehee.. But nonetheless, everyone was in high spirits and on cloud nine! We have learnt so much about one another during the past weeks of consistent practice, and the fact that we have bonded in one way or another has been such an awesome and inspiring experience. I promise, I will never forget the times we've spent together, the fun times, and the not so fun times.  Weizheng ,  Jason hoongy ,  Ruth ,  Siti ,  Jessica  and  Geetha , YOU GUYS ROCK! A big thank you to our 'stage managers', Jiaxin and Wenxing as well.. Haha! Our supporters.. I love you guys!   What a way to start the new year! We also ate "Yu Sheng" and "Lao" with the chopsticks until there was veggie all over our bodies!! Ahahah! Jiax prepared it with her mom. Thanks babe! The guys were very high, threw the veggie everywhere.. Mdm Liu had veggie on her arms.. HAHA.  Mrs Rajah  also gave me a box of chocolates for CNY.. I think cos i got her chocs for X'mas :) while  Mr Lee  got me a box of tissue?! Teeehee, to clean my hands. A pity I wouldn't be able to go to his place to "bai nian" because I would be with my family for the next few days. We took pics together as well, I shall upload them asap!  Wenta' town with the chicks after school to take sticker prints and lunch.. YUMMY! Had jap food :D I'll be leaving for my granny's in a while. I love new years! Hope you guys collect heaps of "hong-bao"! To non-chinese peeps, have a great holiday!    Happy Chinese New Year everyone! Gong Xi Fa Cai!  :)
