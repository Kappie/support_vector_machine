Moving...hehe, at least all that packing before I left wasn't for nothing. That's going to be strange. Going back home and have moved. LOL, the Elli-Maria (Finland exchange student) will probably be more familiar with my house then I am! Well, maybe not. I'm not sure when she's moving in. But it's a thought...  Hehehe...longer post up later today. I need to check some words in it first.  *laughs*
