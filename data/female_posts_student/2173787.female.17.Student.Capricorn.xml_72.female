But now that the hard ones are done I don't want to deal with the rest, so maybe I won't.  I definitely have put off studying tonight and its already 6:30.  Lunch was great, as we left Kay turns to me and asks "can your friends not go anywhere without attracting attention?"  What she doesn't realize is that its the attention that makes it fun, well not the attention but the acts that cause everyone to look.  Lunch was Sam, Diana, Hannah, Graham, Jeff, Erica, Trevor, Rini, Chris, Kayla and me (wow that list was longer than i anticipated, lots of hangers on) around two round tables squished together, each meant to hold no more than 4 a piece.   Wow... We are officially halfway through our 3rd year of school.  That really scares me, it seems just recently that most of us sat in English class as strangers.  First impressions were so odd between us and to an outsider i do imagine their impressions of our group would still be odd.  Now, though, things are just natural and that's awesome, I find that I've been checking my thoughts and actions less frequently.  Somehow over the past 2 1/2 years we all grew close, but lately while we are close we seem to be headed in different directions.  While I stop thinking about the way I act I do stupid things that I regret, which then makes me draw back.  Its an odd feeling, when you find yourself bound tighter and let loose all at once, and yet it seems to be popping up more and more frequently in my mind.  The cycle spins about me and makes me dizzy, a dizziness I love.   Reading over the above paragraph I realize that it ended up somewhere totally different than intended, but is still good.  Kind of like the group, hmm....
