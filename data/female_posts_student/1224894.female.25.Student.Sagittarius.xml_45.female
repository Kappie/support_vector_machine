I wonder sometimes, if you do consider me as your friend, for I felt I’m only an acquaintance gate crashing in a party. For a year, I’ve known you, there was only a few times I felt the closeness of friends. If I am jaded, so are you. I didn’t know you’re insensitive, because I don’t usually receive the brunt of it. But now it seems that the arrows are aimed at me, and it shoots quite accurately.   I am not one to be so harsh in judgments, because God knows I am a sinner, or even a perennial pain in the neck to Him, still, I know I deserve better than what you’ve shown me. It’s hurting, and I’m hurt…true, and if that’s the only way you can treat me, I don’t think I can continue being a friend to you.   My mind may only be provincial compared to yours, you’ve reached the peak of educational success, and who am I but a lone  “probinsiyana”  who only had a glimpse of the real world. I may not be as sophisticated as everyone else is, but I know I have a good heart, and I can be sincere if I want to and when I want to.   But, judge me if my mistakes include meeting you.
