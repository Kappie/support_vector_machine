Yeah, I know, many people have started programming using Modula-2 and later on Turbo/Borland Pascal that evolved into something that we know of as Object Pascal, but comparing Delphi to other high level languages, it is completely out of date. Sure, some aspects are really noteworthy and the IDE is extremely helpful, but hacking code is totally disgusting. Since most of the code doesn't deal with GUIs you simply don't benefit from the advanced IDE. The major drawback I experienced is the completely different implementation of object oriented programming. If you know how to OOP, it's great, now start learning OOP the way Delphi does.  Complaining doesn't help, but thanks to this blog, I'm able to get rid of my "bad vibrations" which do not improve productivity. Delphi developers, please don't take this personally! We are all programmers with individual preferences. Can't wait for the day when I can get back to good old C/C++, .NET, and Java, of course.
