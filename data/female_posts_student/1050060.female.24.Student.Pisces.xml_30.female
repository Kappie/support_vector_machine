Do i have to do what i want. I guess i should face that fear. I should have faced my fears and that i kind of regret not doing so. But i do know that i did the right thing. Which is the right for me now. I got an email tonight from someone i know. He told me that it was normal for me to feel the way i do. I have to met him after classes tomorrow. I am looking forward to that. He can help me with the questions that have been in my mind. I am getting there.   I am about 70% of fully being myself again. I also have fears of losing myself again. But those fears are slowly going away. I have so much support from my roommates. Brenda, Brandi and Linda have been a big help. Without them i don't know what would have happened. Since i have been here things have been good. But yesterday things were falling apart. I want to just scream and cry. Maybe thats what i need to do. Just maybe I have to get things out. But if i do, will I feel weak  or maybe i would feel stronger. who knows!
