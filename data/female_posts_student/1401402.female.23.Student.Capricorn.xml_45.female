You touch my life in such a special way. I missed your fingers running through my hair. Those crazy nights we cuddle in your cozey bed.   Trading e-mails started happening last February. Everything was lovely, sweet and totally lubby dubby.  Since then we would get together at least once a month. Have dinners together, go clubbing or just chill at his place watch movies and of course making out. Regardless, its nice to flirt with someone, even if it is mostly via E-mail. The truth was, I'm not even that interested in dating anyone at that time or not even rite now. He was fun to make out with and I wanted to see him more and more each time. I find him kinda nutty sometimes but he kept my mind off the romance wreckage side. I let myself go with the flow. What ever happen happens. I didn't really care too much of what's ahead of me. No great expectations.   Again and again I dreamt about him. So weird, so strange. It happened at least once or twice a week. Never have I dreamt about a guy as much as I did of him. The very last time I was over at his place I was getting very uncomfortable. Why? Maybe because of the distanced and his disappearance which made me turn away. The whole making out thingy made me so ready to run out the door.   I was uncomfortable because the whole thing made me feel like a fool. I didn't want to be anyone's Bitch, hole, slut and to be stepped on all over. Ever since that night pasted I have learn another lesson. To tell you the truth I didn't regret of what happen because there was no mistaking what was going to happen.   However, as things began to continue we have lost tract of each other somehow. I really didn't know what went wrong. Perhaps I should say he got bored of me and I was not that kinda gal he was looking for eventually. After four completely great months of good via E-mailed flirting, it was time for me to let it go. It was hard to get my mind off from someone I was so into. It was so terrible because I was always so emotional.   I wanted someone who can respect me for who I am. and someone who doesn’t mind me having a baggy. as of now I’ve disconcerted myself out again. There isn’t too much of anything that I want from anyone rite now. But just a real true friendship.
