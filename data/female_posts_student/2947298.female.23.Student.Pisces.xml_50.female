Unlike when they landed in Arizona (Mars), these photos actually show us a better view of Saturn and will help us actually learn things about this very cool looking planet.  I also think for July 4th we should bring Bush Jr. on charges for war crimes he committed this way we show a fair justice system. It will be a celebration of independence from such a tyrant who came into office so unwelcomly. I think his plan on how to pay for all this is owed to us before election time, instead of him bribing us to vote for him again. I figure he got us stuck here he's gonna go to hell.   Personal:  Going to make sure the lyme disease is out of my system. Also going to fight this fine I got unfairly from school. My chair came stained, it was no big deal, but now I get fined $35 for the thing! I don't know why because they will not replace the chair, but they want to take more money from me. I really truly hate Ramapo College's useless Residence Life. They truly only want to make life for everyone difficult and we should soon phase out security with state troopers like other state colleges. This way instead of busting white people for parties they will have a non-biased busting of parties and will spend more time on drug busts because well they are a bigger deal than 21 year olds drinking in their wet apartments. I like all of two security people, and that is it! The rest are biased assholes who do not do actual jobs, they crash campus cars and get US to pay for it with out THEM getting fired or reprimanded at all. So interesting morning I am off to go wait in line for 2hours so that they an take my blood in 2minutes. Bravo!
