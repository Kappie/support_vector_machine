But its never the front teeth its always the back or molars. I keep reading dream intrepretation websites and they all have different meaning, so I dunno whats going on.   So I cut my hair on Friday. I had been growing it out and for some reason, I went in to chop it all off, about 6 inches to be exact. Yep. It just brushes my shoulders. Plus Its DARK brown and Black. and i wanted some blonde in there so i got panels but the chicks at visible (my cousin is a senior stylist there) convinced me to put a temporary hair color on the blonde. Orange! You know that prescription bottle orange, yeah that one. But you can only see the tips coming out from the bottom, but you must put some sunglasses on if michaelle pretends to flip her hair, which i tend to do. It was ok for the first 2 hours, but I am not diggin it. All I can think of is Halloween!! So I already made an appointment for tomorrow so they can strip off the orange. I hope that my hair dosent fall out! Ahhh!   Well the Texas Lotto was 70 million tonight, and I guess I totally missed the drawings on the news, I bought 5 tickets, but the lotto is all fucked up now, I felt like a dumb ass when I went to buy the tickets cuz they have bonus balls and quick pick 5 or 1 and all this crap. Damn, why does it have to be all difficult to win 70 mil? lol. Anyway, So I'm off to the website to see if some of my daydreams can come true!
