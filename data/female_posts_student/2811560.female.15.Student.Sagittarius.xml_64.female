I got first part, which was fun, but if they go off wind ensemble placment, I suspect I won't be on first for the show music. Bummer. Oh well. It was kinda bittersweet, because I really missed the seniors-Richie, Mike, Steve, Noah, etc. It was different. Very different. I guess I better get used to it. I'm being placed in Honors English next year, yay! So now, two honors classes. Sweet. AJ's coming over on Saturday so we can do our Spanish final project. Or so I can do our Spanish final project. As soon as we finish the project, he's leaving. And if he asks if we can have sex while he's over one more time, I will castrate him with a spoon, lol. Grr. I can't believe I agreed to be his partner. Whatever. So it looks like Suzie, Mickey and Bob are going with us on our road trip to Indy...sweet. It'll be one big partay, lol. Speaking of Bob, Emily, Bob, Paul and I were talking about doing something this weekend. I don't know what, though. Whatever we do, I'm sure it will be fun...yay I'm excited!
