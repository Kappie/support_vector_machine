       
      I tell my friends To stop worrying I'm really ok As I cry under my mask I hide the tears And paint the smile And hope they don't see the traces Of disappointment in my voice Of frown in my cheeks And black in my soul    I've always liked the color blue I never knew why I just did Maybe it's because it's the color Of my favorite fruit Of my eyes Of the sky Or of my heart.
