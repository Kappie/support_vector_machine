But mostly my hands hurt and are all blistered up.  You should see my shoes. They are so green. I feel good though. It always feels good to get something accomplished.  I should have used sunscreen though. Stupid stupid. I don't know what I was thinking.  I feel like taking a cold bath or something but I hate baths.  Too bad I have homework. I know I'll just be more tired this evening and I know I won't feel like doing my homework at all. Next weekend I'm doing my homework Friday night and then I won't have to worry about it at all.  Even though I feel good about my mowing, something happened today that wasn't good and I feel really lousy. Really lousy. Awful, really.  Oh well.
