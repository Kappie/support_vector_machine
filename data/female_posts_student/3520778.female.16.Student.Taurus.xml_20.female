Like...Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Groundhog Day...it just seemed too weird!  But then it hit me, these movies may be "spiritual" but being "spiritual"  doesn't mean it's "Godly" or following any religion.  It's funny how obvious things such as this can hit you at an unexpected moment.
