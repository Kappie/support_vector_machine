I don't think I will eat tommorow and well the whole week I think I will just "restrict" myself from eating anything other than fruit, fruit, and more fruit.  And damn I knew I shouldn't of had the Chinese for lunch but I have to admit it was good but probably cost my about 5 pounds.  And then I went to Kirsty's party which was fun and all but we had chips, chocolate, pizza, and cake and then I had to come how and have another dinner!!!  I wasn't even hungry but me, my mom, my dad (flew in from Vancouver this weekend), Ben (Sisters Fiance), Melissa, Bens mother, and Bens mothers boyfriend all came for dinner and I *HAD* to eat again cause it would be rude to sit there and watch everyone else at the table.  So I barely ate but I had to eat something so I had like three meatballs and some veggies then I had to have dessert cause company made it and my Mom told me to eat what they brought.  I can't believe I didn't throw up from eating all that, I have never felt my stomach so loaded ever in my life.  On friday we all went so Starbucks and yeah actually I had more junk Friday which is most likely why I am gaining some weight.  I didn't want fast food but no one wanted to come eat a salad with me and I didnt want to eat alone for I just went to A to eat cause that is where everyone else wanted to go.  Then at Starbucks Travis bought me a chocolate brownie Frap. which was sooo yummy but I hardly get those cause they are like calorie loaded and later everyone left.  Apparently we "wen't out" really for the first time.  We played arcade games for a while which were actually really fun at the coliseum and then we went to go see Scary Movie which was absolutely hilarious.  He asked if I wanted to go for dinner and well I would have wanted to go if I had been hungry and hadn't eaten fast food earlier but I have to watch what I eat more than others.  Other people eat whatever they want, if I ate whatever I wanted all the time I would gain 20 in like a week.  So then after he just walked me home and well he is actually a pretty good person.  But now that I got to know him a little bit better I think of him as ONLY a good friend and nothing more than that cause I really can't see me dating him.  I don't like him in that way.  And well it does kinda of bother me that he is not really too serious about school cause I am, you know like I have goals, hopes, and dreams and I want to do things with my life and go places.  It bothers me a bit that I was talking him and he had told me that he cheated on his Science test and got caught.  I mean I am sure most people have cheated and yeah in my deepest darkest secrets yeah even I have cheated but not recently.  I mean I would never do that in High School and I don't really know why someone would - well actually maybe I might.  Now that I think back...Grade 6 the worst yeah of my life when every person hated me for no reason and I was the ugliest thing on earth and was always the "bad" kid that always got detention.  Anyone who knows me now would probably be suprised to learn that I was not a very well behaved kid.  Cheating for me though was actually I mean the act itself was bad but I cheated on three of my grade 6 achievments - all but the math test.  And well I only did it cause I was soooo scared of failure and maybe that is what gave Travis his motive.  But well cheated boosted my confidence and I really believe that I could do anything - and well my marks as a kid where never great no matter how hard I work so lots of things I found pointless.  So well that next year I worked my ass off, behaved myself, and had no detentions.  People started to notice me more, and were drawn to me.  Finally I was accepted for once with a good range of people.  So I mean I know Travis did a bad thing but there is ALWAYS something good that comes out of those things even though sometimes it may be SOOOOO hard to see the good.  And well I am proud of myself.  I got into the van today and drove for the first time since my drivers ed experience.  I kept thinkin bout' drving so I drove.  But it was different this time.  This time I wasn't scared of the driving, or the road, or others, or anything.  I have to admit my turns are a little sharp and my judgement needs a little improvement but I am sure that will come eventually.  It takes longer for me to usually learn things anyway and I learned the hard way that sometimes things we have to work our asses off and yet that doesn't make us any wiser or better at things.  Although I was proud for driving again, my mother well she isn't helping anything right now.  I asked her what she thought of my driving and if she thought it improved [and yeah I would be the one to know if it has improved or not] and she was like ummmmm blah, blah, blah and started listing all this bad stuff about my driving.  Then I asked if I could drive home from the party cause well I drove there and she told me "no." And well like if she won't let me drive then how can I practice and get better at driving?!?!?  Like duh you just do wake up and your a better driver, although sometimes I wish it worked that way.
