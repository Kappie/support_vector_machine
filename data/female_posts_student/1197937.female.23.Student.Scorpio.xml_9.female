EVERYTHING GOOD BETWEEN MEN  WOMEN  has been written in mud and butter and barbeque sauce. The walls and the floors used to be gorgeous The socks off-white and a near match. The quince with fireblight but we get two pints of jelly in the end. Long walks strengthen the back. You with a fever blister and myself with a sty. Eyes have we and we are forever prey to another's teeth. The torrents go over us. Thunder has not harmed  anyone we know. The river coursing through us is dirty and deep. The left hand protects the rhythm. Watch your head. No fires should be unattended. Especially when wind. Each receives a free swiss army knife. The first few tongues are clearly preparatory. The impression made by yours I carry to my grave. It is just so sad so creepy so beautiful. Bless it. We have so little time to learn, so much...The river courses dirty and deep. Cover the lettuce. Call it a night. O soul. Flow on. Instead.  sorry, very sexual...that's not why i like it though! i just like the cadences. and how it maps out the struggle of the relationship between man and woman. sorry, this is kinda gross, but just like sex. my dad's gonna have a heart attack when he reads this. you hurt each other through your love for each other, tearing away the romanticism of romance, but in the end, what's left is still worthy of being preserved, because love stripped of its petals is still fragrant? that's my optimistic interpretation anyway. it might actually mean that you should just leave it all behind. or something that has nothing to do with anything i just said. i don't konw, help, what do you think?? What's the swiss army knife line mean? and cover the lettuce? i don't get it. any ideas? i think my favorite lines are "the socks off-white and a near match" and "you with a fever blister and myself with a sty." and "no fires should be unattended. especially when wind," and of course, "the impression made by yours i carry to my grave." haha, sorry that's like every other line. the "instead" at the end, is that supposed to leave you with the wonderment of possibilities, what could have been and/or should have been? or that the relationship should go on and does go on despite the writhing struggle and contempt that arises from the intensity between man and woman which makes the river, dirty and deep but flow nonetheless?? okay, that's all. just thought i'd share. feel free to express, flex that brain power, especially all you darn english majors!!!  it's gonna be FRIDAY! yaaaaaay. i love my job, but even job-lovers gotta have us our weekends mun.
