Popular opinion decided that we should invest in a keg of south Texas goodness, from the little brewery in Shiner.   The problems with this plan began on Tuesday, when I stopped by Dicorte's to get an idea of how much this would cost. At this point, I was planning on borrowing a shell from someone and simply getting it filled. The clerk at Dicorte's informed me that they didn't fill kegs, and I would have to, "like, go to a brewery or something." I tried to ignore the fact that several people I know had, in fact, had kegs filled up at non-brewery establishments, and I gave him another chance, asking if, maybe, H-E-B would do it? "No, dude, you'd have to, like, go to a brewery."   In the spirit of being nice, I thanked him for his help and left. Luckily I did not believe him, and today, at another Dicorte's, I had the pleasure of obtaining a keg full of Shiner without making the day-long road trip to Shiner, Texas. Even though I had to help a small boy from the stockroom get the keg into my pickup, I was quite the happy camper.   Then I got home, and realized that there is a reason men always go to pick up kegs in groups. I had always thought it was some weird male-bonding ritual, like women going to the restroom together, but today I discovered the real explanation. Kegs are freaking heavy.  No one was home when I got here, and I was very paranoid about the beer getting hot. I thought to myself, I'm self-sufficient. I can handle this task. I wanted to somehow maneuver the keg into the shaded backyard, put it in a trash can, and fill the trash can with ice. It all seemed so simple. After wrestling with the keg to get it out of the pickup, smashing no less than two toes, and saying several nasty words in front of the neighbors' children, I resorted to rolling it across the yard very slowly, hoping no one was watching. Did I mention that I still had on heels and a skirt? It was quite graceful.  Using a combination of "scoot and wiggle" I managed to get the keg into the trashcan and stand it upright before collapsing into a sweaty, bruised heap on the couch. But I'll be fine, especially after I find someone who knows how to put the tap on; I imagine there will be no shortage of such individuals here in a few hours. All is well with the world.
