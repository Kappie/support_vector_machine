The houses look like stone shacks, but the view inside shows that they are much more elaborate on the inside. There aren't any lawn, just sandy lots often with debris. Some lots had plants growing. Every house had a table outside with blankets stretched over for shade. The houses were pretty close together , easier for neighbours to keep abreast of each others doings. Thus Friday night all the families were out on their porches, or at their table, strolling the sidewalks. The stray cats were out as well guarding their dumpsters. Little dogs were barking away. Instead of leaving your garbage in front of your house you have to bring it to the dumpster. Better that way cuz there are too many hungry straty creatures looking to tear bags up. All in all, a pleasant walk. But SO different from home
