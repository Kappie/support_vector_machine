Shuddering, she grasped her wrist to slow the bleeding, only to have the dagger flick out again and open a vien on the exposed wrist.   "Too bad you only wrote of me as the 'Imaginary Fiend' in your diary. Now I'll get away without a mark." Tittanya's smile sent a shiver racing down Marion's spine.   Darkness crept around the edges of her vision, almost welcoming. Sighing, Marion closed her eyes and slept.
