So I've bought:  The Killers-Somebody Told Me  Franz Ferdinand- Franz Ferdinand  Interpol- Turn On the Bright Lights  Stellastarr*- Stellastarr*   Yeah, I had fun. :D  I am going to take Greg's advice, and buy the Fiery Furnaces' new album,  Blueberry Boat , it looks really good, and got an awesome review on the Pitchfork. It'll be my last one for awhile though, atleast until my next pay period, lol.   In other news, I do believe Greg is slowly turning me into an Indie lover...damn...I never thought I would see the day.  Finally, I am quite tired, and at work. I think I luncheon nap is in order.
