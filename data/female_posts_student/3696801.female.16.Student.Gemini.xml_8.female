I didn't know if I was gonna stay for the lock-in or not...but im glad I did. We had alot of fun...from relay races to eating creamed spinch baby food...ugh. I did get pretty sleepy towards the end and I would have done anything (even ate vienna sauage) to go to sleep. I got home at 7:00 am and slept until 2:30 pm...I sure did get alot of sleep.
