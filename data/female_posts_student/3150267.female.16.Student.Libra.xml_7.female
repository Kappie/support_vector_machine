N this is the 3rd time i m typing this entry... my computer kept on hanging.. n there's nothing more i could do now... except to type a new entry....  Saw her again during recess... really don't have the courage to approach her... easy words like "hi" is now so difficult to tell... really starting to miss her... really want to noe how well she's doing... i hope that she's not angry with me n can get along very well with her friends... i m starting to remember vividly the time we had spent together... from simple things like sharing a drink in KFC to times where she touched my heart n made me feel really warm n secured... i remember how we used to pillow fight in her house... n how we cooked "delicacies" just to have some fun...  to py: i m really very sorry for what i had done.. but i feel that we should have some time where we can mix with other people... we can interact n broaden our social circle... i really don't have the courage to talk to u again.. i m scared that u will be sad.. really very sori... i should have told u the reason... i should have told u how i felt... i should have...... i realise that no matter how much i m writing now, u wouldn't be able to see it... n even if u do, i think we wouldn't be as close as be4... thank u for opening my heart n see a wider perspective of view... thank u for giving me support when i was down.... thank u for encourageing me... thank u for sharing a plate of food with me... thank u for sharing ur "buttercup" with me......  Even thought we can't be close friends again... i hope that we will keep in contact after our secondary school life... luv u...  Plz give me the courage to talk to her the next time i met her... n plz let me meet her....plz.....   ~Thanks be to God for his indescribable gifts...~
