Man, I know three Jerrys, one is a dick from the best that I ken, one is a rocker and consequently, my ultimate idol, and the last is a gay guy who gives a mean haircut and can draw Tina Turner like snapping his fingers. (random)  So suddenly I realize I'm not going to be there for the speeches...I beg your pardon! But it's ok, I'll get Rob and Alex and Julian to start up the chant without me. And I'll be around Thursday so my vote's in. Speeches are about the best part of the year, and here I am about to miss it. Talk about guns, prostitutes, and violence that need to be eliminated, that'll get their attention. And if not you can go J. Edwards and preach damnation. I know watching that happen would get me going.  Jesus, I need a vacation. Fair night, all.
