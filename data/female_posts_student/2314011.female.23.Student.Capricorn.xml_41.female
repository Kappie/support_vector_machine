Just finished the last of my studying for the big Torts exam tomorrow.  I'm sooo ready for Torts; bring on the rat poison disguised as sugar left next to the coffee pot to explode in a felony committing unauthorized visitor in the laboratory's kitchen's face questions!!  As me about Duty, I dare ya!  Or even Proximate Cause!  You don't know about Cause until you talk Proximate Cause, buddy!  Hope I'm not getting all oddly confident only to be sandbagged on the exam.  I've taken two practice ones with success, so I don't think my comfort is unfounded.  Next week's going to be the tougher exams.  Property and Contracts.  Like we need either of them, really.  Going to spend the rest of the day with Susan's Contracts study guide.  Probably a good part of Friday, too.    So "Cold Mountain" is finally getting good.  Probably has something to do with my finally sitting down and reading it for more than 20 minutes.  Can't wait to see Nicole play this role; yet another departure for her.  Suppose none of her roles are really departures, since she has yet to actually define her ability through a particular archetypical role in the first place.  So really, because all of her roles are departures, they're all very much Nicole and not departures at all!  Renee's going to be great as Ruby, too.  I hope they play up the lesbian angle of their relationship.  You just can't tell me that two women working together for survival in the harsh, unforgiving world of Civil War Appalachians aren't going to be finding their only comfort in each other's arms.  You can't!
