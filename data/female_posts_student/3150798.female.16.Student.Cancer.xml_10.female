I'm not all that surprised.  Anyways, we were going to go to the mall to go birthday shopping, but there was an incident in our mall for the second time recently. A couple months ago someone was snatched in the parking lot, yesterday they were chasing this guy who stole someone's purse, and he started shooting up the food court. Mom says she would rather take me to the big mall about an hour and a half away. Fine by me! Our mall has, like, nothing.  I got two birthday presents last night! A couple of my new friends from church got presents for me. A really cute stuffed cat and a little butterfly-shaped clock. I thought that was so sweet, especially since I have only known them for a few months!  Well, that's about it. I gave my shift for tomorrow to someone, so I guess I'll help with the Young Life carwash tomorrow.
