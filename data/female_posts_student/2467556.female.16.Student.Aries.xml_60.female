So i'm all emotionally and physically preparing myself for 4th period where i was under the impression that we were supposed to run a mile.  So i'm getting all ready to run a straight mile and not stop and then Mrs. Brinkman is all like "oh we're not running today, its too cold".  what!?!??!!?!  Its not cold!  Its only 40 degrees! Its colder at the Valley Ranch ice rink when you're sitting in the stands at a game!  (lol Britt! we're hard core! "after spending as much time at that rink as we do, we feel no cold, we feel no pain, we just see hockey and rejoice")  lol we got our height and weight taken today!!!  I'm 5'5 and 108lbs!!!!  I GAINED 8 LBS!!!!!  WOOHOO!!!!  Maybe thats the muscle i've been building......i can only hope.  Because i used to be 100....hmm interesting.    Yeah i kinda had problems with Brittnee today, she wants me to go to her lariette thing but i'm kinda iffy on that.  I really don't want to sit by myself for 2 hrs.  And i kinda already had plans before that to go to the hockey game.  But i feel bad because i want to support Brittnee.  I mean her thing starts at 7 and she only wants me to come for the last 30 mins......but i dunno if the game is going to get out before her thing starts.  I know the game will end between 7:15 and 7:30 and her act is the second to last or something.....but i dunno, i'm sure i'll work it out.  Brittnee said whether i go or not she's not going to do something stupid like end our friendship or something.  I dunno.....my mom said she's help me work it out where i could go to both so it'll be ok.    Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: ok i hope i don't have lunch with this kid next tri because if i see that jacket one more time.........aaaah!!!!!  I didn't get to see what shirt he was wearing today, but $10 its one that doesn't match his skin color.  Kendra and Nadia wanted to see what this kid looked like so i told them that they could see him after 4th period because he usually passes us when we're walkng up the stairs.  But then he didn't come today!!!  Kendra was pointing at every short guy that walked past us saying "is that him?" and i was like no its not, you'll know when its him trust me.  Oh well, we'll try again tomorrow guys lol.    hmmmm ok i guess i'll go work on hw now (aka i'll go call and talk to people about their day)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S- Coppell actually plays Flower Mound this week at 6:30 and the keller game is the week after this week.  *crosses fingers* i hope we win because FM just recently beat Jesuit!!!!!
