They are even thinking of putting him on the ten dollar bill. He was the most loved President, well except for Kennedy of course. There are at this moment doing a 22 gun salute. They should fill the air with sound and smoke in just a moment. Wow, Reagans casket weighs exactly 700 pounds. Rest in Peace our beloved President Ronald Reagan.                                         ~ President Ronald Reagan ~                            1911-2004 Pro-life rocks. God Bless.  **Stef**
