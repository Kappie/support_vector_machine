Just like how I think I deserve a party because I can now do that stupid gaaauuul thing Sarah does with her tongue. I swear,I practiced that longer than I practiced my flute today. I so need to get a life. Anyone out there with any advice for a 14 year old girl,stuck on a farm,with only goats to ommunicate with give me a buzz...or something. Anyway,I tell ya more about me later...that is...if you want to know. Lol,I don't think you do,but it's fun freaking people out. Peace!!
