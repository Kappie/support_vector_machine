What's hardest of all is I didn't seek this one out. I received a letter in the mail, inviting me to hook up with this one. I was confused. How did this one get my address? Then with sudden dread I remembered my little foray onto the internet a few months back when I was looking for something more, something to fill the void in my life. Now because of my stupidity... The cruelest part of all is that this one sought me out and told me I was the kind of person they were seeking, that we'd be very happy together and was looking forward to a long relationship with me. Then when I responded to their glowing letter, eager and excited to get to know this one I was unequivocably rejected. This one claimed I wasn't good enough. I was dejected and heartbroken at first seeing my future dashed on the sharp rocks of reality, then I knew what I had to do. It became my mission last night to warn men and women everywhere if you ever receive a credit card offer in the mail, SHRED IT!          That was fun! I've been thinking about doing that since last night.           I finished this really good book yesterday; it's called The Lovely Bones. It's about a 14-year-old girl who is murdered and she goes to heaven and watches her family, friends, neighbors and murderer living life. She sees her family torn apart, her mom having an affair, her dad retreating into his own shell, her sister dealing with the fact that everyone knows her sister was murdered, and her brother whom no one has really told what happened to his big sister. Some of it's really sad and you can see she really wants to help mend her family, but she's not able to. And she really wants her murderer caught but again she's helpless. But is she? She does manage to break through some people's subconscious, but it's not enough. Anyway, I don't want to give away the entire story. Ann let me have this book after she tried to read it and found it hard to follow and boring. It  was  hard to follow at first and I found myself flipping back through the pages trying to understand who was who. And some parts of the ending were a little surreal for me. But all in all, it was an interesting read.          You know, I really like Tuesdays. There's always a lot on on tv. Monday's are dull, Wednesday and Thursdays are sparse. Friday's a joke. Saturday's a hit or miss. And Sunday's have possibilities. But Tuesdays are the best, at least for me. My tv viewing starts at 7 p.m. with Sex and the City. Then at 8 is Gilmore Girls, 9 Summerland, and 10 Nip/Tuck, which I just recently started getting into because the guy from Charmed is on it and he's so cute.       You know what show is also really good?  CSI.  Not CSI: Miami, which is just a CSI wannabe hoping for a big break with a prima donna to head the cast (David Caruso).  He's a loser.  I like CSI, it's a whodunit with graphic details... sometimes too graphic.  But it's the only show my family will sit down and watch together.  I tried to get them interested in Gilmore Girls, but they had a hard time following all the fast talking.   We used to watch Smallville a few times together, but I stopped because they were more interested in talking than watching.  That's one thing that frustrates me when you're in a movie theater or watching tv -- people who chat or make little comments throughout the entire show.  My mom does this and it drives me batty.            So my morals for today is reject anything that seems too good to be true because it probably is; take time to read a good book, and never watch tv with your mother... ha ha just kidding.  Ta ta for now!
