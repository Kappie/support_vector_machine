It was beginning to storm... lightning was striking the all around the stage. Everything seemed so surreal. The sky was bright yellow, leaving everyone (especially those tripping) in awe. I think that was one of my most favorite moments at bonnaroo. A little snapshot that I have taken with me. -After the rain ended, Phish came on  we ended up leaving early. It was crazy b/c mud was EVERYWHERE...I fell a couple of times  Evan got to laugh his ass off at me. I was also extremely high. I think I smoked more that day than I have ever in my life.... -seriously!!! So, we walked back to our car (3miles away) my feet/ankles/legs had swollen up so bad that I could barely walk. then we proceeded to drive home b/c I had a job interview  a meeting w/ the head of the dept. the next day. However, about 2hrs into the drive I realized that I should not have been driving. So I pulled over  we slept in a parking lot. Evan woke up @ 5am   didn't know where the hell we were :) all in all it was one awesome time :) and a very fun trip ;)
