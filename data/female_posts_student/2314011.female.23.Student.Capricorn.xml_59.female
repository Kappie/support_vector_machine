Johnny fucking Depp as Best Actor in Pirates of the Caribbean.  Okay.    I can forgive the Hollywood Foreign Press for nominating him; the members are eccentric; they're like that; they do that type of thing.  And the American Academy might have gotten away with it, if only for the laugh it produces.  But no laugh can ever purge the taint of the travesty of the Academy's omission.  No nomination for Viggo Mortenson.  No nomination for any of the LOTR cast members.  But Johnny "I look like a reporter on the take from the roaring '20s" Depp gets a nod for his drag queen performance in a movie based on a ride at Disneyland.    Aragorn carried that damn movie!!  He IS THE FUCKING  KING !!  AS IN "RETURN OF THE  KING !!!  I dunno.    I just don't know.
