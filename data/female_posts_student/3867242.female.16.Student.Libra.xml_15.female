When am I going to see Peter Parker take off his shirt? haha. After I finally got out of work, my parents took me to Grandpa's and I got soft served Orange (wasn't great..but it was ice cream.) Now I am home..with nothing to do, just listening to Stevie Nicks "Edge of Seventeen" on the radio (hey when you think about it I am on the edge of seventeen..haha..) Nobody is online tonight..I only talked to like two people. Tommorrow, I'm going to church, then work. I guess I can look foward to next weekend..because it's Townille Old Home Days. I know it's lame but I do like the parade (hey, you get free candy..haha). Dough boys are always good (they're better than the ones we sell at the REC.) Anyways, I thinking about headed to bed soon..or I might watch "A Knight Tale" again...Heath Ledger is HOT in that movie. I love how they put semi-modern music into a movie about the middle ages..haha. Well...I'm going to see if I can do anything semi-exciting with my lame boring self. Night...
