MOVE-DANCE-BE BORN! hehe. inside joke...with myself. sad i know.   what else did i do saturday. ummm, oh manda came over. we worked on science for an hour and then we went to the grocery store and bought all sorts of necessities including the grand enchilada - pistachios! yum yum. so pretty much i've been eating all day today because of those darn things. damn there utterly irresistable salty, pistachio goodness. *le sigh* besides eating i used a weed wacker and had a grand old time. when i first picked it up i said "chain saw massacre?" but then i got over it and liked the power under my fingertips. i am betso here me r-r-run-na-na-nun!  today i also did adopt-a-highway for my local community service help. it was interesting. so far no signs of ticks/any other kind of bug on me. yay! we even got pizza, pop, and ice cream afterwards. afterwards i went to Breathe. it was really good, although i almost fell asleep. they have to be careful how much soothing music they put on at a time. it was almost to relaxing.  and now i'm here, procrastinating, ah yes. it feels good but it's gonna hurt when i actually have to do it. dear god i hope chemistry isn't due tomorrow. wah.  wish me luck.  come to the land of the coconut, -Betso
