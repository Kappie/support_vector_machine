More project after lecture.. Life sucks! And there's been alot of misunderstanding going on with my project members anyway.. The common case of the free riders syndrome.. One of the project members have not been consistent with her work.. This is causing alot of unhappiness among those that have high expectations to score for the exam.. And now I have to act as a middleman.. What am I supposed to do? Argh..  They are thinking of not putting her name down in the project n letting her fail. I guess I just have to take things one step at a time.. I will prevail! Just do my work and talk only when I need to..  haha.. reduce the need to be in the spotlight.. I hate to be a middleman... Its really not much of my business from the way I see it.. Just do my work with the others.. until next semester.. Its bye bye to whoever is not contributing... I guess there would always be conflicts when working in groups.. Well I'm going off now.. bye
