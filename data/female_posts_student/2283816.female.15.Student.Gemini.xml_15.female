So she is back and ready to have one or more personalities write some jolly good things for you. Ummm - let's see.   : : topics of the day : :  ME AS A FAMILY PERSON. I must confess, I do not care if I raise a family or not. I am a rather career-driven person. And after watching that stupid National Geographic movie I am no more encouraged to enter this particular vocation. That is all.   OUR CONCERT: I think it went rather well. The choir had a good night and so did the advanced band. Also the intermediate band and the advanced strings. My, we are the interesting ones, aren't we? *smiles*  MY STRESS BUS: More on that tomorrow.  EVERYONE'S BLOG: I see everyone has abandoned theirs in my absence... I hope this isn't a continued trend, cause I like reading them.  Off to update my subprofile now... chao, my dearests.
