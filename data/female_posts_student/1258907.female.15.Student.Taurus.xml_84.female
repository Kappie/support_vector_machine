When it cant possibly be true I know that when the darkness falls All I can see is you  I admit, at first it seemed blurry But now, its as clear as can be I know that when the lights go out It is only you and me  it is you I think of all day While awaiting for the night I wait all day to be with you It's the only thing that really feels right  When the darkness falls it is you, that I always see We are all alone It is just you and me  Nobody is there to bother me In my few minutes with you And although reality seems a lie My dreams at night are true.
