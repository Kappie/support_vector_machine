But the point is I can't until tomorrow or Saturday. Why? Because I've spent the past five hours doing homework for my college History of World Civilizations class. And that's just my WEEK'S ASSIGNMENT. My class ends on Saturday and I have a final to do as well (an essay). I've left two days open to work on this, tomorrow and Saturday. I am swamped, to be frank.      In other news...she finally figured it out. That I hate soccer. She knocked on my door and said "You have a message from Kambak. She says if you're playing soccer, you have to call her back." Uh. So I told her very politely that no way in hell am I playing soccer; I have thought about it and decided that I am going to be very busy my senior year of high school, what with a job and my senior project and taking additional college classes, and helping run Student Bank and other such nonsense.      So she said Okay. She didn't ask me to explain or anything because she knows and  gets it now .      What else...oh yes. Added a few things to sidebar. The thing near the bottom of it is a random link to a journal through a program called BlogSnob. I can't figure out how to make the font smaller; I tried everything I could but it didn't work. Well, it worked but it just did something really weird and I had to change it back. I know people can format that thing, I saw it on other blogs, but I can't figure it out. Any suggestions?      And I put a counter at the bottom of my journal. I wanted it on the side bar but for some reason when I put it there, it drags down to the bottom of my journal and won't go where I want it. I figure there's some sort of footer code in it I can't figure out. I'm just used to java and perl :( Eh. Well, BLAH. Oh yes - and I put in a little Simpsons random quote thing. It's hilarious, well, most of them anyway.       Also, I am very depressed for a reason I'd rather not divulge. Fuck it all.
