I can't remember when I last posted, so you'll just have to settle for what went down today. Around noon, we (the Arendales, the McDaniels, and Ben's friend Taylor) drove out to a town called Dolores Hidalgo to shop for pottery, or something. We had this really good meat at a restaurant there first thing off. I want to call it barbecue, but there was no barbecue sauce...it was more like tacos. And gorditas. And guacamole. And stuff.  After eating, we tromped around and looked at a bunch of pottery and antiques and churches. None of it was particularly interesting to me, so I'm not going to describe it. If you want that, make somebody else post, cuz you're getting one side of the story here whether you like it or not.  Actually, I will mention the ice cream, cuz it was good. There was this little stand outside one of the churches selling homemade ice cream, and...uh, well, it was really good. That's all there is to say about it. I got the "Vanilla Special"...it was like butter pecan with a hint of cinnamon. Very rich.  So after the ice cream, we headed out to some church in the middle of nowhere because it's one of the top ten restoration projects on Earth, or something like that. It started with an A, but I can't spell it...Atonta-somethin'. There was a cat chillin' in the altar, which was kind of funny, but that covers it. But it took us forever to actually get to the place because Lida n' Laura n' Katy n' Alafair (n' Taylor) wanted to look at antiques and stuff on the side of the road. I will never, ever see the virtue in antiques, but hey, we can't all be perfect.   We finally got home like forty minutes ago, but I've just now been able to get online. And I've got other things to do, so I'll see you folks later. Maybe Dad'll upload some pictures for you or something.  Adios.   P.S. Sorry if this post sounded grumpy; I just didn't get anything out of today. I wasn't miserable or anything, but I wasn't even told we were going anywhere until less than an hour before we left, and nothing about today was worth the trip.  Except maybe the food.  And the ice cream...
