That only white people  Can be this creatively crazy?  I’m coming from that black bourgoise That no one ever sees Always the first “one of the few” never to walk these halls of privilege  Accosted by questions Presuming answers of “Where exactly is Haiti?” “Do you speak Haitia?” ‘Cause you speak really well…..” dot dot dot……  Ask me that question again I’ll squeeze your balls into pearls  Now both sides of the class Are looking at me like  I’m a revolutionary poem Picked from the sky And if you plug me in right  everyone will see the light  But I look back deep down my spine STOP Rewind time  It says that revolution Is that intangible evolution That ever essential Need to see that You’re not  but you want to be free  That’s why it’s taken Three generations for me to know That struggle is a long ride I won’t find freedom in 3  minutes time  Over turning Over changes Over how you know what you want to be By what you’ve seen But how can history be redeemed  When 95%  of your people Can’t fucking read  How? 20 years of family dinners on rice and beans 5 million stories of my family being sliced by machetes jailed imprisoned  for have vision first in the Caribe  to declare themselves free but when people find out I’m Haitian it’s preceded by the word “dirty”  So now you’re looking for your  Revolution In this TOKEN New solution This intellectualized  Feminized Malcolm  X-ample  I’m not it There’s no gospel Coming from these lips  I know why you’re anxious When you look at me You look into my eyes And see a thousand year of beating me You look at my thighs And feel a thousand years of raping me Now you’re wondering why I’m  not aiming to please? You’re angry ‘cause I ain’t down on my knees?  So when I suck my teeth and huff You think of ’92 when the LA Riots scared you You think of Watts and dream of me in handcuffs There revolution wasn’t  The looting or the shooting  It was just when the wealth trickled back down to us For that no matter how many  A’s I get To you I’ll never be more than a B+  I’m pushing away my wallet You can load up your gat Because  I am the aftermath Staring  Back.
