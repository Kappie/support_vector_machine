Except my mom has been annoying, but thats normal for her.  I think this vacation won't be a total flop.  There are just other places i wish i could be for spring break....if you know me, you know what i'm talking about and specific activities i would be participating in, lol!  nothing bad, just more entertaining than Virginia with my family.  While i'm here i get to visit colleges, which is cool.  I need to start looking around anyways.    Yeah now i got gotta go because i'm actually supposed to be looking at Virginia colleges' websites right now.  You guys be safe over Spring Break!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S.- i come back this saturday and thats when we party, lol :)
