Well lets see...Tuesday...I went and saw Terminal, Wednesday I had to take the THEA at Hill college and then went to Jakes for a little bit before I had to go to work...which SUCKED!! Then I came home which sucked a little bit more, just because I was stressed out about that stupid test and having to work with a certain someone. So I ended up taking a really long bath to releave so sort of stress. Then yesterday, which was Thursday, I woke up, took a shower, and went to burleson. I was looking for a job and then I saw ROSS and I love that store so I went in and shopped and got some really really cute pants and this real nice shirt and both of them we're only $11, I love shopping there because I can always save a bunch of money, like last week when me and Jake went a couple of days ago...I only ended up spending $30 on a Nine West wallet, Steve Maddens, a really cute skirt, and two nice shirts. I was very proud of myself. Then after I came home from burleson I cleaned my room up and waited for Jake to get off work. Then my mom told me that I could finally paint my room and that we could go this weekend to look for the paint (even thought I already know what colors Im getting) Then I ended up going over to Jakes to show him my new clothes and to pick up some papers I had left there. OH yeah I forgot I need to get my jacket that I left. (mental note) Then today I woke up kinda late because I didnt go to sleep till about 1 because I had all this energy and I was working on Jakes graduation present and I was going through all of these old pictures. Then I finally got dressed and went looking for a job again which didnt take long cause I only had to go to two places and they were pretty close. And now here I am bored. Im not gonna be able to see Jake today because he doesnt get off work until about 6 and thats when I have to go to work...but maybe I'll get to see him a little bit after work if we go up to Sonic or something. Then tomorrow I gotta go get my oil changed, and me and Jake are going to my Dad's house to have this 4th of July thing were we have this huge water balloon fight and theres tons of food and then we have to leave that afternoon so that I can go to work. Then when I get off work I will hopefully get to stop by Jessicas new house, (hopefully if I have any gas) then Jake is supposed to pick me up because I promised him that I would come to his house for fireworks and stuff after I got off work. But well Im gonna go finish my movie. Till then, Later Days
