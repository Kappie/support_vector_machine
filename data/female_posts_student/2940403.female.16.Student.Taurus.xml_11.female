Wish I was home... in bed. Sleeping a dreamless night. Suspicions. Burning crosses. Dead faith that never existed in the first place. A perfect circle spinning round and roun like a broken record in my head. Spinning. Merry-go-round... memories. Sounds of a distant radio, exploding in someone's ears. Echoes of laughter. Disturbances. Interuptions.
