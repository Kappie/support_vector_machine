I need to take a break n stuff...not from everyone tho...I'll always be glad to talk to Arik...and some other people...I just realize now that I need sometime away from it all. So I don't have to worry about stuff...Mert and Evie helped me a lot today and Im so glad I have such great people like that to talk to. They are such great people. I love them ta death and they do so much for me. I spent about and hour and a half talking with them today and afterwards I felt really good. So yeah...thats about it for now...I'll write again when I decide I want to come back..But I need a break...a good vacation. Later all.  I love you Arik!!!  -Tara
