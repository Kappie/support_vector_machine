Don't get me wrong, there are some lookers here, ahem *****, ***** and a few other random boys, but it just seems like every other guy you run into downt there is cute. Maybe I should go to UCSB. When i was visiting my family they all decided i should go to Uiversity of California, Santa Barbra. They also said that if i decided to go to University of Hawaii, Manoa that they would come visit. Actually they would probably visit me if i was at University of New York too. Since we have family there also. Talking about family from New York, i miss my cousin (actually not my cousin, hes my mom's, cousins son...it's just easier to call him my cousin) Keith, he better come this winter like he said. It would be really cool to take him snowboarding. I'm really bored right now, I wish I could go do something tonight. Wink, wink, someone call me! Well this will be a short blog, there's not much to say about my trip...sadly. I did have fun, but i just don't have any crazy stories...well till i write again, *kate ~and i'm the king of them, pushing everything thats good away
