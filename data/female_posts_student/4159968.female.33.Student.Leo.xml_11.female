I may have been through hell a few times, but it gave me unique and different outlooks on life.      Someone today asked me why I became a domme.  I do not believe that is a simple answer.  Then again I do not choose to label myself a domme all the time.  I am a naturally dominating person.  Does this mean I want a 24/7 slave... no... I like being able to have heated discussions with people... I like being able to disagree with them... and not have them just roll over and give up.  I run into so many misconceptions about dominates in general.  And I know up to a few years ago if a woman said she was a domiante she was seen as an outcast, or a freak.  The location I live in today is still that way (baring certain circles).  Strong women of any type are looked down on and ostracised.  I have been saddled with the name QueenBitch for years simply because I would not back down to the men in my life and work.  I have seen some dommes who went out of their way to be overly cruel because that is what they thought they had to do.  I thought acknowledging my dominate side would free me in a way.  Allow me to explore the side of me that always seemed present.      But my question is... am I?     In reality being dominate has done little but cause me problems in many ways.  My first marriage was ruined because of many things.  One of which was I was not enough of a saidst for him (started as a vanilla marriage).  It wars with the ideals I was brought up with.  A woman is to be ladylike, meek and mild.  Submitting to her mate at least in public and letting him have the lead.  A woman's place is the home and her job is to care for her family.  If she works, she is to put aside the things she wants to do to still care for home and family.  Although I have never had a sub clean etc for me... its not something that would cross my mind.  If he volunteered or did it without being told, I would accept it.  But I am still warring with those ingrained ideas. And now I am constantly approaced by subs who ... at least give the impression...want to be used, but never perform service or really be dominated... hmm that does not sound right.  Most I have been aproached by seem to want to top from the bottom... they do not give the impression of being willing to release that control.       I have seen many dommes who seemed to want to play with as many subs as they could.  For me at least there has to be some connection... and I have to be able to talk to them ... as a real person.   I am not one for notches in my flogger handle.       I have never done much online... except looking at reference sites.  I just cannot get into the sensations and playing online... Even in vanilla realationships its not something I have been able to get into.  I am much more a tactile person and its something I have not really explored.      Rofl I had one dom tell me I could not be a domme cause I liked giving oral ... lol god that started a discussion that he came out loser in =p but maybe wiser.  I love to learn new things... and very few things would I say out and out no to.  I am usually willing to try something, provided I can do it safely for my partner.     Lol ok time to go lose my mind in more games.
