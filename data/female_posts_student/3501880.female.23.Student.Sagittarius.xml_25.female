Listening to:   Outkast, "Roses"    Watching:   The last night of E!'s 101 Hollywood Secrets    Mood:   intelligentsia...sorry, that isn't really a mood, but whatevs, yo!    "Life's Not Living Without Tiramisu"--Camryn Manheim  I not sure many blog entries get off to a good start by quoting Camryn Manheim, but what the hell.  Coming from a long line of guilt-ridden worriers, I am constantly thinking about how I need to improve my life. I need to eat healthier, exercise more, spend less, save more, don't drink, don't smoke (while drinking), read the newspaper and classic literature more, etc. etc. The list goes on indefinitely.   Recently, I came across a guy on the internet--okay, I had been browsing match.com--who seemed like a real health nut. I quickly crossed him off my potential dating list for this reason, because I not sure I could commit myself to a man who does not like a healthy portion of vice in their life.   Then, it like hit like Richard Simmons in an airport--I don't like living without a healthy portion of vice in my life. A few years ago, my mom imposed a low-carb diet regime on the family (before the Atkins craze), and I had been miserable. I felt cranky and bitchy and basically I would have performed circus tricks for a piece of bread. Truly, there are few things I like more in this life than gorging myself on cookies, cakes, ice cream, pizza, and hamburgers.   I really don't like maintaining a regular exercise rountine, because basically, I hate being sweaty. It is bad enough feeling obligated to shower once a day, so naturally I detest the idea of having to do it more than once. (Of course, it would be unreasonable to think that I might get up earlier than normal to exercise in order to facilitate having to shower only once during the day).  If I want to have rampant, unprotected sex with strange men in odd places, then you know what? Fuck off, because I am going to do it anyway. Also, what the hell is the big deal about using dirty needles to shoot-up? Seriously, I just think people are being germaphobes about that.
