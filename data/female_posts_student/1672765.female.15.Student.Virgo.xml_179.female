My dad and sister don't know. I do. It's killing me.  I'm so worried.   I don't understand why some people have more money than they know what to do with, never doing anything for it and some people work so hard and barely or never make ends meet.  Me, my sister and dad are going to a game on Wednesday and I asked at dinner today, wouldn't we need cash? My dad said yeah...he doesn't expect a thing. My mom was quiet and I could tell she was a little nervous. I feel horrible.   I hate knowing but I also think it's good that I do.  Two CDs I've been looking foward to are coming out at the end of the month and I really want them but I'm not going to buy CDs at a time like this. I feel lousy.  I talked to Shelby the first time in a long while. It was weird. It feels weird to be around anybody I know.   I never RSVPed to Tara. I don't know what that means exactly. I kind of wanted to go but the last party I went to was in 5th grade. I wouldn't know what to do.  Shelby's birthday party is coming up and I know I don't want to go but I know what Shelby will feel like if I don't go  again . I don't know what to do about that.  The problem that I always have is getting to me again and I hate that.  I'm doing the best that I can.  It's not enough.  While I'm complaining. My teeth hurt. Stupid braces.  Which reminds me. Do you have any idea how much braces cost? I still have a lot of surgery to get done on that one part of my mouth. That's going to cost alot. Then I have impacted wisdom teeth. Need to get though cut out too. I wish I didn't have to be so expensive.  I don't know where the day went to. I don't know if this is bad or good.  I'm tired. But not as tired as I was earlier.  At least my head doesn't hurt as bad as it did.    That is all for now.    Music: This Isn't the Tenka-ichi-Budokai - I Hate Myself
