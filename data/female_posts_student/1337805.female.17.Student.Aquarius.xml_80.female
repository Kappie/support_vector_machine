My friends are home yes, but no one is communicating, so the closest time (unless I dooooo something about it) I get to see everyone is Saturday, at the lake. Weeee!!! Lake! And it's even at my fave lake, Elk. So I'm bringing my air mattress, and if anyone pops it...*death* I just hope its sunny in time. I need to get a new bathing suit top by then too. Cause then I can wear my new dress! Magic.  Youth group is in 5 days! Yippee!! It's such a huge up for me at any time of my life, even if it doesn't seem so while I'm there. Helps me through, knowing I get to be weird for a few hours, and do some plllllanning! I saw Kula, or Ian, yesterday at mayfair. I almost didn't recognize him, but then I realized it was him! He's still super cute too....mreow..But I thought he had gone to Seabeck with Luke and all them.....Damn faulty information. I wonder how come he doesn't come to youth group anymore. I need something to drool over. Plus, I'm hoping to increase our numbers, by bringing friends. On friday, I have to pick between Laura and Alanna....  Adam wants me to go to a nude beach with him and a few others to well..."swim" and play some strip poker and such. I dunno if I really wanna do the whole nude thing, but it would be soooo wild. I realize how young I am around them, when they talk about stuff, but it's alright, cause they all think I'm like, 19 or 20 anyways. I told my dad that and he freaked out. But it's true. I've fooled many. I had to remind Adam how old I was when he proposed this idea that I'm still young and might stare. I hoped that would get me out of it, but it wont. Eh!  :( I miss my Alex..I haven't spoken to him since I got back from Winnipeg, and I miss that crazy bum. We had so much fun together...I wish I had talked to him at least once this summer, I wanna know if he's going to Van, and if he wants to hop on a ferry to here.....:(:( *sobs* Allllllex! I misses you...Email me back. So I know. You'd damn well be planning on going to Edmonton too, or else.  Re-reading this blog, and having Jess's help, I've been realizing that I've been quite a flirty girl lately, and that some people might get offended. But...Heh....Maybe it's time I found out where we stand and what's going on between us, cause I'm very much confused..People say I'm single (and 15, damn you lannie) others ask me how my booooooooyfriend is. I dunno, cause I'm not even sure if that's what we are! Alright! Wahh...  Hey Tom, think I need to talk to you:)
