       
      Well, I am now back from my little Indy trip and I'm going to type all the junk I wrote on the bus. Here goes:      7:2? AM.  Don't know the time because Amy's sister's head is in the way. Oh - 7:26. Listening to Ev and sitting by Jessie on the bus. Semi Preps are in front. I have my knee on the seat in order to annoy them. Didn't I tell everyone I would hole up in a corner and not speak to anyone?  Well, at least Jessie seems to understand the rule of NOT ASKING what I'm writing.  Just had a Strawberry Cheesecake jelly bean. OMG, it is good *savors* Chloe's laugh is gonna bug me this whole trip. GAH.  *is very bored* My Immortal is on and I think I'll turn on a musical. I'd rather not be depressed today. And at the rate it's taking to leave, I'll probably finish the CD.   *listens to Defying Gravity* mm... I wonder what Michael and Brandon are doing. It is now 7:35. They're probably hitting each other and taking pictures. *sigh* Co-ed buses would be so much fun. I really should have brought my book. That's why I'm writing so much; I have nothing better to do. Hey - maybe Luthe's grandma is late - that's why we're still sitting here. Otherwise we'll be under the careful dictatorship of Mrs. Pio! *smile* Whom I do like... YES!! ;38, we. are. moving!! uh oh... highway writing...not gonna be good.  *Idina reaches climax of song. I stop babbling to listen. Thank Goodness comes on, and I proceed babbling.* I think I needed that break. My hand is going to be smashed. *sigh* I haven't done this in awhile, it seems. Write a lot in pencil. It's all on the computer *nowadays*.  Jessie just pointed out a weird smell. *shrug*  Weee couldn't be happier!  Anyway, my current book it "Beautiful as the Moon, Radiant as the Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Women in Yiddish Stories." The title says it all. Kristin Chen sings her operatic trills in the background*  I'm already on my fourth page. Geez.    7:45 AM.  All the people of Oz love Glinda! Whoo! *end* I could get sooo much reading done. I'll just occupy myself with writing. We are on Coliseum Blvd. I really am terrible with streets and the whole lot... I see a Snider baseball field out the window. How can you not like Wonderful just a little? Just for the cornfed hick line. And the "we call it history" line. Heh. I love it. *dance music for it*   I haven't been to Baskin Robbins in YEARS. *sings with Idina and Wizard*  Someone should just whisk me away now and take me to New York to see this play!!! I love "As Long As You're Mine" ... mmm... Idina's voice sounds good with everyone. "Just for this moment - as long as you're mine!"   I think when I'm done with whatever, I'll write a review of the CD for amazon.com or whoever.  1) No One Mourns the Wicked: (7) Nice, pretty overture, compilation of many of the songs. The cast comes in, singing about the death of the Witch. Glinda has a pretty, opera-riddled solo. This song is good, not good enough that I always listen to it. Glinda then goes on and explains Elphaba's birth/conception...her mother's green lover and her father's disownment after finding out she's green. Poor girl - but the citizens of Oz have no mercy, because "No one mourns the wicked!" The end of the song sounds just like the finale.   2) Dear Old Shiz: (4) Song is sung about the dear old sorcery college. I never listen to it. Doesn't make sense without seeing the musical.   3) The Wizard and I: (6) Even though I WORSHIP Idina's talent, I rarely listen to this song. It's pretty, but I enjoy others more, and this one gets lost. Elphaba sings about how she hopes the Wizard will team with her.  It's sad, because we she sings about her dreams - yet we know how THOSE turn out. And how she wants to be "degreenified." Here's where the "unlimited" line comes in first. Beautiful conclusion - IM's voice makes it worth it.  4) What Is This Feeling?: (8) G(a)linda and Elphaba discover they're roommates and clash immediately. It's hard to resist singing along, it's so good. The rest of the students don't like the green girl either and they join in singing... AWESOME.   5) Something Bad: (4) Again, I usually skip this one. It doesn't make any sense without the musical. Just proves Idina can harmonize with anybody.  6) Dancing Through Life: (7) Fiyero starts it off by inviting Galinda to the Ozdust Ballroom... Elphaba's little sister Nessa is set up with a munchkin boy, Boq, by Galinda. Galinda gives Elphaba her famous pointed hat. It's a nice, flowing song, that would make more sense in the musical. The dancing is probably great to watch. It's pretty long and I don't always listen.  7) Popular: (8.5) Galinda and Elphaba are friends by now, and Galinda decides Elphie's in need of a makeover. The resulting song is hilarious and addictive. Kristin Chen sounds great. She has great timing and will remind you completely of all the preps you knew in school.   8) I'm Not That Girl: (6.5) Everyoen can relate to this song in some way. Idina sounds packed with emotion, which only adds to its appeal. It's simple, so you either love it or hate it. I love it.  At this point, I will commence watching Finding Nemo.    8:49 AM.  Those Pixar People are so smart. Dory!! She reminds me so much of myself... short-term memory loss. *sigh* I love her. Oooomg, latte flavored jelly bean *SAVORS*  Sharks! With Alcoholics Anonymous! YAY!  We are now entering Gas City.   The Shark Scene is like, the BEST. Poor Bruce. Can't stand the pull of fish blood. ES-CAP-E!!!!!! I am SO naming a pet that someday. aww... poor Nemo in a dentist fishcage. Hee. My Bubbles. Bonjour. Hee, hee, hee. Voila, he is Clean. Auntie Flo! and Deb! Ah, rest area. We will see what goes on.   9:07 AM.  Jessie: Is that a log of our travel?   Anyway. I had a cookie courtesy of Megan! Thanks! I think my mom liked her thank you notes. I'll have to ask. The volume went down. Hm.   Rolling through the fields of What Indiana Is Famous For. *sigh* Branbo! Michaelangelooo... What are you doing?? Hillaree - I can see you but you're all the way in the back at a table and I can only wave. My vocals don't carry that far.   I'm kinda tired. I want to sleep a little - oh. Liz pulled the curtain down. I guess I can sleep. It's just sooooo bumpy. I'm having problems writing. Both of my knees are on her seat now. Maybe they put the curtains down so we wouldn't have to stare at the CORN. Grr. *curls up with Rent soundtrack to sleep*   10:03 AM.  Well, I didn't sleep, but I listened to Rent. There is no way I can memorize all these songs! Anybody with friends needs to hear Seasons of Love and Happy New Year, or at least read the lyrics. OMG. There was such a huge bump that the carpet thing fell off Abby's TV. Several people screamed. The cons of all-girl buses.   "You can take the girl out of Hicksville, but you can't take the Hicksville out of a girl..." Passing a little white house. PERSON: That's where Bob Ewell lives.  ME: Hahaha!  I am annoyed with myself. I only brought one battery. *tsk* Annnnd 10:16 AM, we roll into the Indiana State Musem. Idina wails. Goodbye!   1:27 PM.  *settles into seat with "What Is This Feeling?"* :) Loathing - there's a strange exhilaration. BOO! Ah! *boom*  Okay. Had a decent time, barely saw anything educational so the trip was rather wasted. And now I really, really, really don't want to go back to school. *Popular!* Can you imagine singing that song every day for WEEKS?? You'd really have to enjoy your job... Hmm...  Hillary - Glinda Laura - Elphaba Michael - Wizard Brandon - Fiyero  Because I am bored and will continue to be so. *Don't dream too far...*   Hey, it's the Princess Bride! I kinda like this movie and I wanna save my CD batteries. The song's over anyway.    2:00 PM.  Middle of Princess Bride. I can't decide on Boyfriend. Inigo or Wesley? Wesley reminds me so much of Sark, yet he's taken already. By Butterbitch. Inidgo is witty, swordfighter, yet he's taken by revenge. What's his career plan afterward, hm?  Maybe I'll kill Butterbitch. He'll see she's wrong for him... and then I can have Inigo on the side. I'll move to India, I think it's legal there. Oh, and Katie's (Araceli's) boyfriend is Vizzini. You know you want him, girl...Kill him, Wesley dear.  I decided. Boyfriend is Inigo, but Lover is Wesley. May they never meet again. There's nothing likeable about Butterbitch, darling! Drop her immediately! And darling? Never take that sexy black mask off.   *regains sanity*  The Prince needs to shut up. "Never wrong," my ass.  DARLING! YOU TOOK YOUR MASK OFF TO KISS BUTTERBITCH!! WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, YOU UNFAITHFUL LITTLE   *regains sanity*  Okaay, I am SO seeing New Kelly, because mobs/guns/hitmen/Heath/******* = Best. Film. Ever. Those casting agents knew what they were doing.   I personally think Cary Elwes is hotter when beaten up. It so works for him. My hair is bugging me - these little stray ends are ticling my eyes and face. What. Does. Wesley. See. In. Butterbitch. As far as I can tell, she has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Damn zodiac signs - it seems that no one is compatible with me. Aquarius and Libra are my best. I don't know many of those. But I have to find out what moon I was born under. Those supposedly make a difference. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a half-Scorpio. I mean, one side of me is all serious and the other is a complete spaz.   I think I want to sleep again.   Oh - did I mention I finished my epilogue this morning? And now I'm going to print it out and give it to Katie for Harsh Critiquement.   I wonder if there's such a thing as Group Blog where other people can post too. Will check on that. Because if so, I think I'll put Brandon's Conquest of the World in blog form. It'll be so much easier. I've got a craving for Wicked. Here we go...  Boyfriend is on the bottle again. Hee. He is so my boyfriend. Hillaree! I'm back in the Elite Club! I'm dating a Spanish rum-drinking swordfighter! We deserve each other... It's really amazing how much we have in common, eh?  "The wickedest witch there ever was, the enemy of all of us here in Oz, is dead! Good news!" What is Boyfriend doing? Oh. He's apparently being guided to the right direction by his sword. *green lover sings* :)  I go flying off the handle quite a lot and can't help it. Oh well. More corn. I ought to go back and sit by Hill, I'm bored up here now. WICKED!! I think all four of us brought this CD. *I hope you're happy too*  How many fantasy movies were made in the 80s? Geez.   I think I'll go back to Rent after Defying Gravity ends. Not very far now, but I'm going to crank it up and drown in it. Be right back.  That song is so genius. IM's ability to sound so strong and vulnerable at the same, and so desperate... I cried almost. And I was shivering. I wouldn't want to be anyone but her.  Apparently a camera is needed to take a pic of Abby M. No clue.. oh, she has chocolate smashed all over her face. Good for her. *sigh* Where's RENT? And I need to sharpen this pencil, but it's not like I have a sharpener.   *December 24* - *stops*  BOYFRIEND!!  Oh yeah, he doesn't die... still though. The thought of anyone inflicting pain on Boyfriend just SICKENS me. *sings* Boyfriend ain't gonna dieeeeee....  Oh. Lightening. Hm. *looks * Don't see any.  Butterbitch is such a dumbass.Die. HAH! And the Prince is a weanie. Those two are meant for each other. Inigo and Wesley are meant for ME!!  Wow, that lightening was huge. A little creepy, no?   I can't stand to watch them kiss. *sigh* Well, girl can't have everything. Come here, Inigo. Let me hold you...   3:06 PM.  *turns on Rent and grabs sharper pencil* You know, just for Contact, Rent should be R-rated.   Stop SCREAMING, morons. The storm has really picked up. We drove right into it, I think.   YAY!! Voice Mail #1!! :)  Luckily Mrs. Q can't hear a damn thing. Good Lord.   Oooh, bad language. *turns to song 23* La Vie Boheme!!! I reaaaaaaaally love this song. And nooo, I don't want to sing those irritating songs today/now.   Wow, I wrote a lot.   That pizza for lunch was really good. I don't understand how Michaelangelo didn't like it. *sings with chorus* La Vie Boheme! This music is so GOOD!! AHH!! I want to live la vie Boheme. *sigh* I am now very cold. And I will need new batteries soon.   3:37 PM.  There is no way I will ever get to see Rent *sigh* It's RIDDLED with R-rated references. *smiles and sings to Take Me or Leave Me* Who cares if it's two lesbians? :-P  Back on Coliseum Blvd. How exciting going home. I'm telling you, I SO cannot go back to school after this. TAKE ME BABY! OR LEAVE ME! Seasons of Love is so beautiful. I'm going to post the lyrics in my profile.   BORDERS! *shrieks as Nikky shrieks "Mall!"*  People!! Stop yelling. I'm tired of you all. Grr. Nikki dearest! Enough!!  *turns up music to drown out them*  Seasons of ... love....  THE END.
