Delivery took 3 pickup trucks and 12 men and while the total value of the coins is yet to be determined, those counting have estimated the ciruclated coins alone are worth $41,000.  Who said it doesn't pay to be a packrat?  Maybe my grandmother is right and all that crap she's saving WILL be worth something.  Keep your fingers crossed.
