I miss waking up surrounded my mist-filled mountains  I miss the people there, how warm and sincere and friendly  I miss hearing their language, the puk ayam which means ‘my beloved’   I miss sitting by the fire at night to keep warm, while roasting Bario jagungs and sweet potatoes on it.  I miss fishing in the pond which penghulu had, where even a 3 year old kid could fish since the minute the bread touched the water the fish would bite.  I miss the freezing showers in which we could only last 2 minutes.   I miss trekking up the mountains and standing on the lil hill of grass which had grown over what was originally bull-poop.  I miss riding at the back of penghulu pick-up, my butt getting bumped about due to the rough roads.  I miss the Bario church service where I didn’t understand a thing during worship but I thoroughly enjoyed it. (or rather the word should be ‘blessed by it’.. it sounds holier)   I miss the lovely lovely food.   I miss the wonderful wind blowing at your face the whole day through while you sit by the window reading Amy Tan or John Grisham.   I miss walking through the square padi patches.   I miss watching the beeeeooooooteefool sun setting behind the mountains.   I miss the tiny airport, where everybody in town could be found there during mid-day discussing bout the latest events.   I miss auntie Freda, auntie Midang, uncle Roland, penghulu.   My heart sighs.
