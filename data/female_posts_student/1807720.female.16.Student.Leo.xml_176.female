Of course I haven't been feeling all that well and stuff and well am anticipating the results from the blood test cause I am almost convinced that something is wrong.  And well I did good on my Bio quiz!  YAY!  I just really need to do good on the unit test on Tuesday cause the last two I didn't do so well.  I don't know why though.  I studied for both, read over the chapter(s), and went over the concept objectives.  I know that I know that stuff.  It is so frustrating!!!!!  I just want to be good at something, I want to be good at Bio.  I don't just always want to be the hard working girl that is good at Drama and fit for a stage.  I don't just want to be good at Drama, I want to be at something that will get me somewhere in life.  I am trying though and I KNOW that no matter what happens I am passing Bio, but I want to do better.  So frustrating but I guess that is part of the process I have to do through to get to where I want to be later in life.  After school today we striked the set for the play, and it only took us an hour to get everything down.  Then I went home, ate a muffin and a half, two slices of raisin bread with jam, and about 7 crackers with jam and water.  That was really good!  Next Friday Mr. B is taking us all out for dinner at B.P. and I am also getting my nails done that afternoon.  It's hard to believe my sisters wedding is one week away from Saturday and the rehearsal is on Thursday.  Time flies by so quickly.  I wrote this poem a while ago, just thinking about things in the past.  It's called Beside me you Will Stand.       Beside Me You Will Stand   With time I've come to grow and learn and in time I've come to understand There are so many amazing teachers, friends, and people that can lend a helping hand When I thought that I just "can't" I was reminded that I "can" I realize now I am capable of anything and beside me you will stand  There were times when I thought I couldn't continue on Times that saw my life as short instead of extraordinarily long And though I must admit sometimes I felt as though I couldn't carry on There were friends and teachers there who saw it as duty to care I Would have felt to be all alone but I know there was always someone there  I cried so many nights thinking that "I can't" So many remarkable teachers reminded me that "I can" And there are those who I could never thank enough  For how many times you asked how things were going When school seemed just too much, when life seemed all too tough  Wonderful people that I did meet tell me "Don't be hard on yourself" At the end of the day I realize the many talents I do posses Though sometimes it takes more than just hard work and effort to gain success At times I have given up and failed, but forgot that there will always be another test Whether a test from God, test during school, or a test from friends to prove my cool  With time I've come to grow and learn and in time I've come to understand There are so many amazing teachers, friends, and people that can lend a helping hand When I thought that I just "can't" I was reminded that I "can" I realize now I am capable of anything and beside me you will stand
