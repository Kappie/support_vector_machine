Well they are time bombs and they are ticking And the only questions when...they'll blow up! And they'll blow up, we know that without a doubt. Cause they're those girls, yeah, you know those girls That let their emotions get the best of them. GO!!!  And I've contrived some sort of a plan To help my fellow man...  Let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings So we'll be tipped off to when they're ticked off Cause we'll know just what they're thinking, Just what they're thinking...  She's so pretty but she doesn't always act that way Emotions swinging on the swingset almost everyday She said to me that she's so happy it's depressing And all I said was "Someone get that girl a mood ring!"  If it's drama you want, then look no further They're like the Real World meets Boy Meets World  meets Days of Our Lives. And it just kills me how they get away with murder They'll anger you then bat their eyes Those pretty eyes that watch you sympathize GO!!!  And I've contrived some sort of a plan To help my fellow man...  Let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings So we'll be tipped off to when they're ticked off Cause we'll know just what they're thinking, Just what they're thinking...  She's so pretty but she doesn't always act that way Emotions swinging on the swingset almost everyday She said to me that she's so stressed out that it's soothing And all I said was "Someone get that girl a mood ring!"  Cause when it's black  means "watch your back" because you're probably The last person in the world right now she wants to see And when it's blue it means you should call her up immediatly and ask her out because she'll most likely agree And when it's green it simply means that she is really stressed And when it's clear it means she's completely emotionless And that's alright I must confess  We all know the girls that I am talking about She likes you Wednesday, but now it's Friday And she has to wash her hair And it just figures that we'll never figure them out Well, first she's Jekyll and then she's Hyde... at least she makes a lovely pair.  Mood Ring, oh Mood Ring,  oh tell me will you bring the key To unlock this mystery? Of girls and their emotions Play it back in slow motion So I may understand The complex infrastucture known as the female mind    relient k - mood ring
