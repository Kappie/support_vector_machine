It's strange how I get so cold at night while I'm asleep, even with a warm comforter and pillows on every side to wrap my arms around instead. I woke up this morning with my 3 year old laying horizontal across my stomach. It was sooo sweet! I must have been really tired, I didn't even know he was there till we woke up.  I've been moving furniture all day, getting ready to start painting next weekend. I think that's why I'm having a lonely night. Something new and no special one here to share it with. It's nice the way I have things arranged. A few things needed moving to encourage better Feng Shui.  I did decide to rent the room at my friend's salon to do my facials in. My entrepreneur spirit has been awakened. I just came to the realization that I can make more money doing Mary Kay 40 hours a week than I can working 40 hours at Owen's Company. I shouldn't doubt myself. I have a covered 8' X 16' wall with awards encouraging the confidence I should have in myself, that I DO have in myself. I brought home a lousy $200 from OC last week for working 40 hours. I can make that in 10 hours with Mary Kay. I would rather be in control of my financial destiny. I'm scared and excited all at the same time. I promised my supervisor at OC that I would hear her part time proposal in the morning. They do not want me to leave. Of course, you know I'm still going to shop there, who wouldn't!! I did get another sign when I walked into the salon yesterday. Margaritaville was playing on the radio, my favorite song. It's been years since I've heard it played on the radio.  I also want to purchase a massage chair. I was in the salon this weekend and one of the prominent ladies from the courthouse that's worked there for 20 years and has a ton of pull said I could practice on her. I could set up a chair in the salon or volunteer at the courthouse while they take their lunch. I'd get a jumpstart on clientele. I have so many goals I want to accomplish.  I may have given up my husband and my marriage, but look how luck has followed me since. I know he was bringing me bad luck because he still has bad luck following him now. He's not a bad person and I'm not saying he deserves it at all, but it's a strange thing to observe. Of course he is getting a brand new home, but he has to have his reclusive Brother to stay with him and cling right back beside his parents where he's always tried to get back too. I love my family too, but I'm too independent to not take the opportunity to move to distant lands if destiny calls for it. I know I don't have the nicest place in the world, but it's mine and I can create and build all that I desire to foster growth in my being. My 5 year goal is to have a small stable with 2-3 appaloosas in the few acres not being used right now. I want to have gone out of the country at least twice by my 5th year. Maybe to visit Vietnam, Stonehenge, or Thailand (your money goes a long way in Thailand!).  In 5 years my oldest will be in high school and my other two boys will be in junior high. I need to be an inspiration to them. Their Father will lead them straight to the mills when they graduate. I want them to go to college and have a career in what their heart desires. I want them to realize their destiny very early in their life or at least not to ignore it like I did when I should have embraced it as a teenager. It feels good to be making my own path now. Getting sidetracked was not a bad thing.  All in all, things are going very well. I may be lonely here at this present moment, but I know that I am in the thoughts of many tonight..my Mother, Father, Brother, Children, Grandmother, Friends, and a Special person that may be far in miles but not in spirit.  I am at peace and will rest well tonight safe in the arms of my pillows. :D Take care of my heart, take care of my hands, watch over my loved ones, and resonate within me your beautiful song.  With love,  BLG
