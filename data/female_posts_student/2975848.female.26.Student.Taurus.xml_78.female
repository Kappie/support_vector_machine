The day was passing, and I was waiting impatiently, for you. Then you showed up.  I feel I’ve reached the stars. We started to talk. But something was very wrong. I could tell. You were very anxious, and nervous. I got panicked. Then you said it: “I don’t really love you!” For that very moment everything felt down. Everything lost its meaning. You stabbed a dagger deep in my heart. Never felt so lost in pain. All my dreams, hopes, happiness, were gone, Like ashes in the wind. Life got dark, and meaningless. But today, what still makes me hurt is, That I still cry for you. I still love you. Dam you!!!
