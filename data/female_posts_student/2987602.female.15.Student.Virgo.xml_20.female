Nothin much happened while i was away i just got home today and then i went out to the mall w/ Dani and Tory. We saw The Borne Supremacy and tht was so so... i mean like it was kinda borin in some parts idk i have a weird taste in movies but i thought this felt a little too long... so yea i had yet another RIDICULOUS curfew but this time it was 9 00!!! I was soooooo pissed lol, but hey @ least i got to see Dani 2day i havent seen her for about 2 weeks but we didnt really get much of a chance to talk like alone i mean lol. I wish i was allowed 2 sleep over @ her house 2night so tht i coulda stayed out later, hopefully this week since its only my dad ill b able to stay out later. Itll also b SOOOOOOOO much easier to get around him bc he doesnt know all my friends home #'s so i wont get busted like i almost did 2day lol... my mom was pissed tht i went to the movies and then like when i called her she was like well how did u get there and i was like Dani's mom drove us so like i was freakin out bc Tory really drove me and like i didnt know if she was gonna call her house or ne thing but she didnt so i didnt get in ne trouble so i definatly feel better, i got scared there for a little while tht i was gonns b grounded during my week of freedom lol... man this sneakin around stuff is gettin old, kinda like my curfews heh heh. well, all's well tht ends well, i think thts how it goes. well thts pretty much my day so later
