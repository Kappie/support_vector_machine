I get up and I see a crepe for our Lost Generation Salon sitting in the Recycling bin.  I pick it up and tell everyone that it looks and feels like a Fortune Cookie.  Burnside yells out: Alright, money out on the table people.  So, for $4.26 I ate a six day old crepe.  Hella Bling Blinging it right now.
