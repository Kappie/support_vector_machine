At first I couldn't even register what he was talking about... (lol) I had only slept for a couple hours by then.  So i was going to attempt to meet him in court at 8:30am... and that means 9 am for me =)  When I got there the first thing i wanted to do was give him a big, huge hug... i know that he's been stressing over this.   It was going relatively well, he was waiting to speak to the prosecutor.  let's skip ahead.  The prosecutor and Isaiah were speaking when I came out of the court room and completely missing each other.  Isaiah was saying that his driving record was clear according to the sheet from Washington state on May 3 or something like that... but the problem was, the prosecutor was saying that the ticket was issued April 13th so on that day his license was suspended.  He and Isaiah were completely missing each other on that small fact and... ugh.. it was just a miscommunication.  Well he came out pretty unscathed and with a fine of $250.  We decided to eat and then he was going to head out to work, but that didn't happen.  We went to dave and busters~! yay .. we had so much fun.. (i killed him in the many, many basketball games..) It was amazing.. i felt like i was flying being there with him... First the connection at church and then me telling him how i felt and we just connected in a different way.. we were starting to really communicate better.....  THE PHONE CALL FROM HELL....  Then his mom called on the way back from Dave and Busters... in the conversation he went on to tell her about the ticket and the fines he paid... but somehow along the lines he told her that I help him clear out the misunderstanding between him and the prosecutor and at the mere mention of my name.. all hell broke loose.. she began to question him and grill him on why i was there and why i shouldnt be there and it was my fault he had tickets to begin with because i kept him out late or something..(completely not true.. the ticket was during the day or dusk or something..)  He tried to tell her that I had helped him out but she just made him feel guilty for it.. and the bad part was. .i could hear her saying things about me... really negative things.. It really got to me at this point...  i pray for this woman.. i have the same interest in mind as she does.. we both want Isaiah to be happy... what is her problem? I feel sooooo strained.. when i try to maintain the whole "turn the other cheek" thing.. its hard when you are trying and the other person is striking..
