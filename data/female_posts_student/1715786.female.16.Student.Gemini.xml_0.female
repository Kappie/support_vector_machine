I love the book! Sure, it might be a bit heavy, filled with words that no one uses in the daily life, but that’s just the type of person Sting is. He uses the words he needs to express himself, and to make the readers experience more believable. I would recommend you to check out the book as soon as possible!       When I’ve finished it, I’m starting on  Lolita . My copy of the book has a very amusing story behind it: I spent all my shopping days in England looking for the book. But no one had it in stock. Not even Barter Books! And on the second last day, we went to Metro Centre, and there, right before I was about to leave HMV, it was sitting there on the shelf, with a price tag saying £2.99! How cool is that? So I went over to it, grabbed it, and paid for it.    I think Sylvia’s gift will arrive tomorrow, so I’ll go pick it up, and then go over to Lars’, because he wanted to watch  Lost in Translation , so I offered to lend him my DVD, and watch it together with him. Yay. So, loads of fun going on tomorrow.    Last night, while talking with Lars on MSN, I realized that I won’t be going to band camp again till I’m 19! And that’s kind of sad, because I really wanted to go this year, but I couldn’t, and I’d totally forgotten about my exchange year next year. I’m not saying that I’d rather go to band camp than to the US, I’m just saying that I’m gonna miss it. I really hope I’ll get to play in some kind of band in America.
