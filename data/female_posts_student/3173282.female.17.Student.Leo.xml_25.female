I have fucking finals tomorrow that i didn't study for because i had to write too many damn papers and do projects. I still have to do a vocal portfolio thing but hell if that will get done. And i've just been thinking about ALOT of things and i dont think it matters where i live, i'm not going to be happy anywhere. Because that's just how that goes. The only thing that can make me happy, i have fucked up so many times and it will just never happen and it makes me really mad and sad and so torn between places. And i should express my true feelings but that will just make everything so much worse. Everything is gay. If u can make me happy in any way please do it cuz i really need it right now! PEACE
