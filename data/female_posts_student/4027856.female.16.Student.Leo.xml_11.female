If I go back to Ohio..and Laura and Halie and such are still the same..I am talking to dad, bc that will drive me insane..lol or maybe I am just being mean bc I am sad. I am going to miss my mom so much, but its not like I am never going to see her again..I think its just that fear from the times that I had to leave and never knew when I would see her again. Thats a real sucky feeling. But I will be back before I know it..and then next year it will be for sure, and no more of this back and forth stuff.
