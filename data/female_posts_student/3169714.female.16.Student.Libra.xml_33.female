I just really felt like... my whole world was falling apart.. and I just wanted to end my life... my heart hurt sooo much.... actually it still is hurting... that really will leave a scar on me.... i wont ever forget that... I thought he loved me and nothing can change that but... as it proved tonight something as simple as what we talked about could change and end our relationship....... I feel like shit...
