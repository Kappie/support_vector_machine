Dad and I went to this PGA golf thing...we saw Paul H.(a friend of the family's)We found out that he has a new golf course in...TOKYO! i am dead serious!..Yatsuki (i think)...but he still has a house in Hilton Head. He used to be a trick shot golfer. He visited my dads golf course in WV and my Grandpa's golf course many times before that. I think I might have to fake sing tomarrow lol...I literally can't sing nothing comes out of my mouth lol. I mean, I was on the phone talkin to deidra and she was asking if i was going to SAA thing tomarrow cuz i didnt sound like i normally do...i don't have a raspy voice.    I went to Dr.Phillips High School tonight for the VPA magnet thing. The school is awesome they have 2 dance studios!This guy performed and he was amazing. He was singing and acting and he was just...like holy cow. The dance magnet program focuses on ballet and modern which is great. When i audition i have to perform a dance already taught by the teachers and then i get todo a 1min. dance of my own choreography of any dance form. yay...modern or...hip hop still deciding. But anyway..big day tomarrow and im still drowsy so i'll post tomarrow after my performance.
