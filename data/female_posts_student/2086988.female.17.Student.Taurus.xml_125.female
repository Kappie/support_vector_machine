Not to mention the 20 people that asked me why I wasn't at prom. I had my reasons for not going, too much hassle, come on, $45-50 for a ticket, have to get your nails done, toenails, eyeborws waxed, hair done, makeup, etc. And it wouldn't of been worth it to me. Plus, I think it's best just to go to your senior prom, that is the one that really matters anyways. I still should of went...  So I'm a manager for the North Stars, yeah I had tryouts, didn't make the team, but my hard work did not go unnoticed for once.
