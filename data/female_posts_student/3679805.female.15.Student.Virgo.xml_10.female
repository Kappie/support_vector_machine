I miss the songs I miss the laughs. I miss the tears. I miss the fights. I miss the bonding. I miss the spice girls on the bus rides home. I miss how we comforted each other when we had a shitty came. I miss most of all is just being together, listening to angie tell us how she wants her    boobs to grow!    We dreaded....  the fact that kelly was leavin us  the fact that as soon as the season was over some of our bonds might break  jv season.. we all know we are in for an awakening   We loved...   the practices   the games   the parties   the bus rides   the inside jokes no one else got (ex. BLUE BALLS?!?, F.O.W?)   our coach!!   the spice girl songs angie use to sing on top of her lungs   the season   I miss you ladies already... we did such a great job going 8 straight games with  out loosing one! i love you ladies so much... i dont know what id ever do if i never met half of you!!! especially sully.. haha on fire are we? ;-) good times ladies good times!     ~kc
