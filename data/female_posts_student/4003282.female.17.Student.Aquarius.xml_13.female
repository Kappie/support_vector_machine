Aww they looked so  hot . Then it started raining. It cooled them off.    I can't believe schools about to start. I'm a  Jounior ! Wow. I just can't believe it. I'm graduateing in like  2 years . No more school after that. *  tear  *      Josh is my  world . and I am   his .    L  a  t  e  r   D  a  y  z
