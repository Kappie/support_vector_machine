I am a 38 year old, mother of 2 girls with a great husband. Why do I want to blog... Well, I have a lot to share and I can relate to almost everything. I am here to share with you my trials and tribulations and maybe you could realize that you are not alone.  Have a great saturday and will be here later.. Be good.
