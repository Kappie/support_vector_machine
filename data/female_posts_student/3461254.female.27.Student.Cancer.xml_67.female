We have so much in common so far!  He called me around 9:00 and we talked nonstop until around 11:00, when I had to cut the conversation short because I had to get to sleep and was starting to lose my voice.  He seems like a nice guy (well, they all start out that way,) and I'm going to call him tonight to carry on the chat.  Yay!
