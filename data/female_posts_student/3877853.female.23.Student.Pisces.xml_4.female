I met my wonderful friend Rob when I started the improv show in October. As he would say, I fancied him immediately. He is adorable, after all. But I honestly wasn't sure if he was gay. (Looking back, it's like not noticing someone has three arms.) Our castmate Vicki felt the same way. Only she spent a lot more time with Rob than I did. One day it came out (no pun intended) that yes, he was gay. Alright, sucks for me and Vicki, but no big deal, he's still awesome and we're all still great friends.        Then, I come back from Christmas break, and guess who's dating? Rob and Vicki! The gay man and the woman! It took me a while to get past the whole "But you're gay" thing, until one day I said to myself, "Hey, it's their relationship, not yours, and if they're cool with it you should be too, so just deal." And I dealt, and I think they are a lovely couple and I really think they're gonna make it.        The greatest part about it is that Rob is so totally still my gay boyfriend. Helistens to me cry about guysand tells me when I'm being a freak. We watch bad TV and movies together and bitch about everyone we know. He tells me I look like crap. All of the wonderful things a gay boyfriend is supposed to do and - bonus for him! - he gets to have a real girlfriend too.        The only downside is that now I can't offer to be the only woman he ever sleeps with.
