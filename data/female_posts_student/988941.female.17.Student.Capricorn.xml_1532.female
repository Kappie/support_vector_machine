My monitor blew up on me the other evening as in it did actually blow up, bang and smoke and all. Now the other bit is doing werid stuff so that will soon follow, plus it doesn't like the screen we have on it now so gah.  Cool that Andy is having fun, he'll have to show us all the pictures and whatnot.  Blog people!
