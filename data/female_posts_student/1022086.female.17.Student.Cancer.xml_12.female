I wasn't very happy to go visit him, for, you know, it's been 3-3.5 years now, and I'm kind of fed up with oral apparatuses in general. My appointment was at 10.30 am, and because school was out today, the office was super-busy. So, at 11.something Morris finally approaches me...   And what does he say?  He says I'm ready to get the braces off!!!  I jumped and rejoiced, amusing likely all present at the office, but I believed (and still do) that I had every right to be utterly psyched.  Next Tuesday, half of the metal will be removed. The remainders are coming off the Monday after.   I am so very excited and happy and yayefied!!!  No braces = life improvement. How, you ask? Well, if you have to ask, you've obviously never had to wear braces.   1. No more pain. 2. No more food stuck in between the braces. 3. Better tooth brushability. 4. Increased number of toothbrushes spared/ toothbrush conservation. 5. Less conductivity of electricity. 6. Less gum sensibility. 7. (*Sings*)"No more tears, no more suffering, no more fears as we cross into the light!" 8. Better unstickability of chewing/bubble gum/candy to braces.  9. Less weight to bear. 10. Probability of flags getting stuck to teeth lowered. 11. Mouth liberation. 12. Better singing capabilities (once the braces are off, he can't put anymore elastics in!!!) 13. I could go on forever, you know.  But I really need to do some homework and a few other tasks as I return to school tomorrow, unfortunately.    ^.^ *dances* The braces will be removed!!!
