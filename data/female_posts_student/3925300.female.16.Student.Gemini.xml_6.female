Jonah came home and I think i was kinda rude it made me really sad. I think I ahd him upset at me too. Anyways Ashley came over agian to hang out around 3 I think we sat on the comp all day she talked to all my friends and junk acting like i wasn't there. haha anyways we had a run to some radio stations set up and got free little camers so we where snapping stupid pics lol it was great. But then Brian called me and is like im coming over and he comes over while my dad is here and junk wow that was weird him his bro me and ashley hung out lol. We all orderd pizza and Ashley and I got freakin hyper and she got on mic and we where acting like idiots to my friends yay. Then after ash left I got really depressed was so paranoid and was like a time bomb even more then I ahd been all day. I thank you Chris so much for being there for me! =)   OK and I need to paint my nails and Ill tell you about today later
