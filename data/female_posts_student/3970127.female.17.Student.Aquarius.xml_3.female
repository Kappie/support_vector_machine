I really enjoyed it, and I had a certain peace about it, that I know that Physiotherapy is the thing for me. (I have lots of pros and cons about it:) ) I spent most of the day with Boris, a hot Physio, heehee, and he was really great. He taught me some stuff during  urlLink free  moments, and techniques etc. Although, at one point since I was his "belle assisante Ecossaise", (for some reason he didn't call me Anglaise) a lady had come in because she has a handicapped friend and he was teaching her how to get him in and out of  urlLink wheelchairs , so I was the guinea pig :) haha - I wasn't complaining! ;) I also worked with two women: Anne and Mireille, who were both very nice. I did some work up in the geriatrics ward, where there was a guy called Francoise around my age who was Nurses' Age, who again, was very attractive, and we had a good  urlLink time  lifting nice old ladies out of their  urlLink beds  and for a walk along the corridor!! I also worked a bit in the soins intensif, which was quite sad :(. So yes, I had a good day!
