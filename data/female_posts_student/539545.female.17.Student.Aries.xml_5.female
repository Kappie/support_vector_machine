Or even just "The Blood Suckers". Basically, we've gotta have a name that makes somebody puke. Actually, these band names don't suck, they're just not awesome enough. And there's too many of them. Hey, we could call ourselves the blood-sucking martians. Wait, what am I talking about? Oh, must be that ADD kicking in.  Okay, my real idea was "Kariya," named after Paul Kariya, the Colorado Avalanche's left wing. I think that name would be cool, and we could get hockey jerseys with his name on it, which would exponentially increase the awesomeness of this band. Drugs! Drugs! Drugs! Don't worry, I'm not on them.....right now! HE HE HE HE! Oh yeah, tell me what you think.
