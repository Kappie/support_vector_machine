I still am in a way. Jeff and I got stoned out on the balcony then headed back inside to play Mario Kart. I am the all ruling gamer of the GameCube. Go me... boo... Nick got back from class at 4:30. I stumbled out of Paul's room to see him screaming at the phone, I'm assuming it was his girlfriend. Easy. That's all I have to say.   I gave Nick his 80s Mix CDs. I guess he liked him, not much of a reaction came from his face. Oh well... I cooked dinner then played mind games with Nick and ink blots. Paul, Henk and myself then headed out to Sean and Ethan's place to drink. Oh yes, they got me drunk and then some. I won at poker though. I gave the $60 to my poor brother. He owes me. Nick showed up and I told him to make sure I made it home okay. I also told him to make sure I didn't end up in Paul's bed because that would have been a big problem. I then headed outside for a cigarette and then passed out on the couch that's on the deck. I heard everyone talking about me and I smelled the scent of a book being lit on fire. I couldn't cough, I wanted to but I was just too tired. "Is she out?" "Yeah" "She told me to make sure she got home okay. I don't know why she trusts me so much" "She's going to have a serious hang over" "We'll make her walk back" "Nah... Todd's coming to pick her up in a few" "Is she going to yak?" "I don't know" "Probably" *poke poke* "If you've gotta yak, yak. C'mon it'll make you feel better" ---black out--- 'God I hope I don't die tonight' "What'd you say Ash?" "She won't die" ---black out--- "Pick her up" "C'mon, lets go, your ride is here" "Hey Ash, everything's going to be okay" 'Okay, I'll be fine' *stumbled down the stairs and falls in the grass* *the puking begins* That's the first time that anything besides snot has come out of my nose "Now you've got the college experience" "I'm here to take you home. You can puke out the window if you need to" I was led into Todd's car and we slowly drove back to Fiji. "I'll take it nice and slow for you okay?" 'Thank you' I thanked the guys so much that night. Todd got me a glass of water as I fell down on Nick's couch. He then grabbed me a pillow, the trash can, and a blanket. "This is what a frat is all about, taking care of each other" Looking back on it now I want to cry because they were so considerate. I was so trashed. I was so glad I didn't go home with Paul. I woke up in the middle of the night to see where everyone was. I walked back into Nick's room and closed the door rather loudly. I didn't know he was even sleeping in the room at the time. I apologized for waking him up and then passed out for a few more hours on the couch. One foot on the ground, as Allen has always taught me. "Don't worry, you won't die" Nick said, sure of himself, and we both went to sleep.   It was good and bad at the same time. I felt like such a jackass for puking, and we won't even talk about how unattractive it was. Well, life goes on I guess. I'm glad I don't have a hang over.
