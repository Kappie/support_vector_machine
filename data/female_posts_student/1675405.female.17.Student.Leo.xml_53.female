I made pina coladas and watched American Pie 2 with Eliza tonight. She hates Jefferson, I hate Jefferson... we have something in common.  Argued with Marie. She called me rude, and I told her she was being a fruit. Ah, the wonders of a good friendship.  Attempted to talk to Max. Her mind is elsewhere.  Talked to Ben. He's confused and drowning in his own testosterone.
