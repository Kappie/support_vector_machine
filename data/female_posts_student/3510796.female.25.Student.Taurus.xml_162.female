The past few days have been crazy. Thursday night I met up with Superfly at The Bar, it was $ pints and I only spent $2. We wont get into how much I drank, Im not supposed to even be drinking. Anyway, we sat outside and like always, this group of people came and asked if they could sit with us. And since we are so nice and enjoy the company of strangers, we said of course they could share the table with us. Three guys and a chick. We all ended up talking and just having a good time. Before we knew it, it was last call and time to go home.  You dont have to go home, but you cant stay here.  I actually hate that saying, it just sounds geek-ish.        Friday was all in all a good day. Made plans to go see this band at another bar, I posted about that earlier. Then Saturday was the birthday party and the concert at the fair. Yesteryday I took the kids up to my grandmas and made plans for the week at the lake. Getting meals planned and what not. Nothing too exciting. I showed Av a pic of Mr. Bigpants and she seemed to be  impressed.  Finally got the kids to bed and ended up watching  Monster.  Strange movie. Wasnt that impressed. Mr. Bigpants didnt like it much either. Not really a date movie.
