The Sun-Star has beautiful sculpturesque looks in an all metal construction. This Japanese gadget is a modern take on those early 20th century  urlLink paper fasteners . The Sun-Star is $34.50.   If you want to start using the environmentally-friendly stapleless system but spend less money, there's a less stylish but just as functional version at  urlLink Uncommon Goods  for just $10.00
