Now I'm embarking upon a 2.5 week journey in which Matt and I will be driving something like 4000 miles.  Okay, maybe not quite that many, but close.  But I'll see my family, my friends, and my cat, and I'll be with Matt, so it should be worth it.    Anyhoo, Kenya was really good.  I got along with Stan, I have lots of ideas about dissertation projects, etc.     And I don't feel like typing in my blog.
