We even chose people we know to play each part. Of course, it was a spoof...and we thought it was pretty funny at the time. Or at least I did. Of course, when we read it over (out loud and to my mother, no less) we realized what it was: stupid. Really, really, patheticly stupid. Ten wasted hours. I feel like such an idiot.
