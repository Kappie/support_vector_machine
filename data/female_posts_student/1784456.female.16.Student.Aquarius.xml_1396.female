It says something like:  Why did Bill Gates call his operating system *or something like that* 'Windows'  ('Windows' in English) when he could have called it 'Gates' ('Gates'  in English)?  Don't ask. I was looking for English in the i section of the English - Spanish dictionary. Get it, inglish? Makes looooads more sense!  urlLink http://www.sitiodesordos.com.ar/los.htm   Look at number 29. It says something like:  If a person with multiple personalities decides to commit suicide... can they be consider to have taken hostages?  Ahh...  urlLink babel.altavista.com  Translate here. Mmm... it's a bit weird actually.  Remember: Fish may be pink, People may be blue. But sure as hell, That smell is you.
