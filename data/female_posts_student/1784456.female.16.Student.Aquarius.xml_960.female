Hey, but I think I'm being hit by PMS at the moment so that might explain why I'm sooooooo  ANGRY!  Any hoo I got really pissed off at school! (More pissed off than now?) Yeah! Lots! Hehe, every one's getting on this searching for the karma phone thingy! Well it's not here! MUHAHAHA! (Aww, that's not very nice now, is it?) Ok, ok, so you can get it here :  urlLink http://r1.eu.rmi.yahoo.com/rmi/http://www.alt-gifts.com/  That's for every one who's mad enough to click on a link that says 'Just to Keep me Sane'! (you) Ahh... good point! £70!!!! Geez, have a nice phone to any one who has that much money! *Eeek!* What I could do with £70... *ahh* *Manga!* Yeay! Hmm... I like that head! (:'( ) Heey! Shut up you! Any hoo, I better post another stressy post, cause that would totally clash with the whole 'cool phone' thing that's going on. (?) Ahh what the heck!
