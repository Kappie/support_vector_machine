I woke up this morning with dylan curled around me. It was so cute.  then when we got up he VOLUNTEERED AND MADE ME BREAKFAST! and he asked what i wanted and all. I felt so special. he gets points for that.  he made me all happy this morning.  Yesterday i went with liz to meet alex. I guess i dont know him... but he seems like he sucks. He kind of reminds me of the way dylan used to be. I would wait somewhere for a long time, and he wouldnt show up and id be like "oh god, if he doesnt show up, ill be so mad" and then hed show up, finally. Or he wouldnt show up at all. And then he wouldnt really act like he was happy to see me... or hed just talk about sex and i'd feel like a walking vagina. Anyway, alex showed up and did this and then was like "Why havent we had sex? i havent had sex in 3 months. blah blah" and then he refused to go anywhere cause we "might" see someone he knew and didnt want to talk to. And his teeth are gross.   anyway.   liz is just this beautiful person, inside and out... i hate to be cliche but she is. She is so much better than this guy...she could find someone who truly loves her and who would walk miles and miles in the rain just to meet her... not just meet her when it's convenient for him. blah blah blah, i'm cliche. But the point is, liz rocks and this guy sucks.   i have a job interview today, im all scared.  oh no, i was just picking my nose and i realized dylans watching me on my webcam. Oops.. :\ hehe...  People are strange when youre a stranger Faces look ugly, when youre alone Women seem wicked when you're unwanted Steets are uneven when you're down when youre strange... faces come out of the rain when youre strange... no one remembers your name when youre strange  when youre strange when youre strange  I feel all preppy and stupid, and now i have to go talk to someone about how they should hire me with purple hair.  abby
