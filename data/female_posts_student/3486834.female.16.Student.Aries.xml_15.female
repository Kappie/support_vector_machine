I'm not that bad of a drawer, but i haven't done it in a while. So I stayed up until about 5:30 a.m. doing that. So then I just hung out til about 7.. then I had to pack to go out of town.. We are going everywhere.. California, Las Vegas.. and somewhere WAY south. Ugh.. well it took me forever to pack, since I don't really know when I am comming home. Sometime in July.. maybe sooner, if I can beg my mom to go home. It will be nice to see all of my old friends. I miss them a lot. I lost almost everyones number tho.. hmm, sux. Last time I went out of town, I spent 3 nights at Emily's house.. haha it was tyte. Haha.. that's when I called Amanda and Sophie fags.. oops. I think they still hate me for that. I forgot why I called them that tho. Well I feel bad for doing it.. So sorry and yeah :(.. I hope I'm not leaving tomorrow. Cause I wanted to see Shrek 2 again, since I didn't get to see it today. If we don't leave tomorrow, or eh today.. then we are leaving thursday. I don't want to.. I am going to miss everyone SOOOOOO much. I love you guys!! I will hopefully get to write in my blog at my aunts house or something. And I will try to call everyone, if I get a chance..  I watched game 2 of the playoffs. Damnit the Lakers won. posers. They went into overtime cause Kobe had to make a 3 pointer in the last 10 seconds or something. That makes me so mad. gah. Now i'm pissed thinking about the Lakers beating the Pistons...  Ok.. what else. .. HAPPY BIRTHDAY URIAH! lol. Two more days til yaya's birthday. Aw crap, I have to get her something before I leave. I still don't know what to get her.. hmm.. maybe she will like money. Everyone likes that. I will have to ask my mom for more money.. OMG today my mom told me that I had a lot of money somewhere in the house.. so I looked EVERYWHERE.. she wouldn't tell me where it was, cause she said it would be like a treasure hunt. how gay. well i found it.. it was 5 dollars, in gold coins.. even worse. So now.. my summer balance is at $8.71.. wow!!  that's sad.. I hope to get 500 dollars of my own by the end of this year... to buy something.  What should I buy....? Wow what could I get with 500 dollars.. I'm gunna have to think about that.    Haha I was so bored last night that I wrote a story. It's lame so yeah. Gahh I am bored. And tired. But I am going to stay up.. again. It's not like I am going to do anything til around 7 tomorrow so yeah. "A Favor House Atlantic" is a really cool song.. I am probably the only one that likes it tho. ha. Another tyte song is "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows".. I have no clue why I like it, but I thought you may want to know that it is a good one. Ok, I hope you have learned something. God bless.
