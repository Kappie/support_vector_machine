Whether you cry or not, do yourselves a favor and  urlLink go read Andrew Sullivan's email of the day .  It's a very beautiful and moving piece of writing in regards to the death of Pat Tillman.  Here's what the reader has to say about life and death:   So much value is placed on living a long life, it is easy to lose sight of the underlying assumption that the reason we hope to live long is so we have more time to live worthily. What it means to live worthily is sometimes hard to tell. People have lots of opinions about what you are supposed to be doing with your life, but when the end of the line comes, you're the one who has to lie there alone on your deathbed and reflect upon the choices you made when all is said and done. If only that reflection were done earlier in life instead of later.   Please go read the whole thing.  It's not very long and is well worth the time.
