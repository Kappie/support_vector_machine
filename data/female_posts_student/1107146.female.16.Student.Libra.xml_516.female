Fechner blinded himself during his experiments, that's about the funniest part to this project, he was looking at the sun trying to "gauge the intensity of the sensation".  Thanks for eliminating yourself from the gene pool, Gustav!  Anyway, I recorded a new song last night, and I must say, my sonic skills are going up a bit. It's interesting that they are getting better, since I've haven't recorded since finishing the last song of the "really bad demo"...just been reading on it a lot and thinking of how stuff could sound really cool if I went just a bit overboard.  That would explain why I used about four different mics on one acoustic, and two on an amplifier (that's not so bad). But it sounds really good for an early cut...I'd go so far as to say, some of the better sonics I've ever done.  Woot! I'm going to take a break from stupid research now, because it's really gay and I hate it and want it to be shot in the face and foot simultaneously with a projectile weapon. And I'm almost done too, this guy is really frick'n popular. He influenced Wundt, if that says anything.  Salut, mes amis.
