One, I only had $5 on me so I couldn't buy anything.  Two, Erica and I went to DEB and looked at formal dresses.    Saturday:  I had to babysit at 7:30 am, so I didn't get to sleep in like the rest of my peers.  Oh well, I survived.  Then I came home and packed boxes.  I know FUN!  After the excitement with the boxes I decided it was time to kick it up a notch and study for the PSAT more.   (Man, that book is humbling!)  Afterwards, Renae, Megan and I went to the mall, went to eat, to Best Buy and then to visit Sean at Hy-vee.  Everyone works at Hy-Vee I swear.  I saw Emily, that was nice.   After Hy-Vee we sorta drove around for a bit before I decided I wanted to go home.  Came home attempted more homework and then went to bed.  Sunday:  Sunday is consumed with more packing, church and any homework that still needs to be done!   ~tata
