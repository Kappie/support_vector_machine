It was quite heartbreaking, and it still is. I mean, it sort of sucks, realising that you practicallybroke someone's heart, threw it on the ground, and thenjumped on it a million times. The worse thing is, I didn't even realise I was doing any of that to him!Oh well, everything's resolved now. I'll butt out of his entire life, forget our past together, and let him live a little... Oh, god, but it's going to be SO hard. Well, doing all of that isn't going to be that hard, at least I think it isn't... No, it is going to be SO hard not looking for his face when I'm at school and everything... It's going to be hard to not search for him wherever I go... Ah, yes, it's going to be really hard.    Fortunately, I'm not the only one in the same situation. I've hurt Alex, and my twin sister has hurt Mindy. I turned Alex into the unhappy person that he is today. Nicole's place is sort of like mine. See, her friend Mindy is insanely jealous of Nicole. Well, James, Nicole's ex best guy friend, was in love with Nicole. Well, the problem was, Mindy really, REALLY liked James. Anyways, James called Mindy fat. So, Mindy turned anorexic for a week or two in hopes of becoming like Nicole. Unfortunately, this situation isn't exactly like mine. This only lasted maybe two weeks at the latest.(Mindy almost fainted and then turned back to food.) My situation has been going on for about two years! Well, not any more... I'm changing everything, yup, everything... Now, all I have to do is unclench my claws from him...    Er, how do I do that exactly?
