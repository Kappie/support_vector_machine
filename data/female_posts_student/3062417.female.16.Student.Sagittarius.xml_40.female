I had a nice talk with Danielle today during study hall about stuff. And guidance came in and talked to us about college during English today.  Well, day before prom and SAT's. I'm freaking out. I'm gonna be up for like over 24 hours straight. It's gonna be friggen awesome though. I can't wait. We are going to Zebbs and then back to Mike's house after. I hope my mom lets me say out late. Tonight I'm not doing anything. Except maybe taking a practice SAT. But that's about it so if anyone wants to stop by my house and hang out you are more than welcome.  So, right now, I'm just sitting here and listening to The Early November and I'm about to go grab the guitar and play a bit. I love music. It's slowly becoming my life. And, suprisingly, I'm happy about that because I know that I can always count on music.  Song: We find our Our way through this Knowing That the actors Who play our friends They always win  CHORUS: So come in We're all inside of nothing The place where we live our lives And take all you want Because we ain't got nothing to lose We're always looking up  But the hardest To pretend Is that we never quit So the actors who play ourselves Say they never cared -Sesame, Sheshame- The Early November
