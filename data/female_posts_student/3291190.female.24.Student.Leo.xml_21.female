He is going crazy b/c of the morphine, he told my mom that he can smell the mold behind the wall paper in the hospital room..???? don't ask me...he also doesn't like the sound of the phone ringing...so I haven't talked to him since it happened. Mom doesn't want to answer the phone b/c she is tired...GREAT.  As for my sister, she is out of the hospital but keeps going back b/c she has some type of infection or something in addition to kidney stones...yada, yada, yada. As for Rob, he has moved on  is continuing his trek across country. Evan...I bailed him out (which was a feat in it's self). Dealing w/ the bond guys (who are shady as hell). We chilled out for a day or so  then went to get his car from the impound lot. His car was dead, the windows were down, we had to TYE his battery on with a ROPE!!!  if that wasn't bad enough it began to thunderstorm while we were trying to find someone to jump his car. Oh yeah...did I mention he doesn't have reverse? So I fell while trying to push his car backwards. Jeezz. at any rate I looked like a drowned rat  I think my cold got worse b/c of the whole ordeal. Oh well, @ least he wasn't hurt. Its been a strange couple of days. I am glad it has finally calmed down... I started my job today @ a steel factory. That was fun (not really) I have to wear huge protective eye goggles, ear plugs, hard hat  steel toed boots....there are 180 men in the factory  only 2 women....(including me). Its going to be an experience!
