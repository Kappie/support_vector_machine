Then I drove to Best buy and bought the Donnie Darko (excellent movie) soundtrack with the gift card Elizabeth Anderson got me for my birthday.  (Thanks Lizard)  I love it.  Taking a left at the stoplight that takes 5 minutes to change, the sign in front of me was mirroring the flashing turn signal from my car and the three behind me.  It was captivating.  While listening to the Donnie Darko soundtrack that I bought today, I completely zoned out.  It's hard for me to stay focused when driving at night... kinda scary.  All of the lights are so cool to look at... so mesmerizing.  I went to Steph and Jess's softball game today, to skip it with Rachel and go to the track meet instead to check out the hot guys.  There were a lot.  Then we went to the Burnsville mall to shop for some khaki pants and red shirts that I need for my new job at Targay... and there were more hot guys.  Then I realized how pathetically lonely I am.  Here I am, talking trash about this asshole rich preppy fucker who hit on me while he has a girlfriend... and all I'm doing is gawking at every hot guy that walks by me.  After being "single" for awhile now, and trying to ignore the hormonal shit that comes with being a teen,  I realize....  I need a significant other.
