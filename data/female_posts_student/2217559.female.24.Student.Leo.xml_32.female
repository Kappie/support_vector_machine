STARCODES are pages on a select few beepers that run to the scene of a life or death situation. I am on that starcode team as I am the grief counselor for whoever is with the person who is dead, dying, or in process.  It's awful. Such an horible responsibility for someone to have - consoling someone who's family memeber (albeit huband, child, wife, et al) is not doing well. Friday night, my pager sas, "Starcode, Pavillion, Dck 7, Aft."  I threw everything down in my arms and just started running. It scared the hell out of me. Absolutely. I won't go into details but let's just say that it is only today that I feeling better. It felt like a scene out of ER.   Last night was formal and both of my officers had a wonderful dinner. My boss, told me before he sat - "Excellent." Which is a big compliment from him. I think he still questions my abilities since this is my first time on a ship. Apparently, it is really hard to get a job on a ship and they rarely hire new people.  So , it's taking all of us "first timers" time to gain the respect and confidence that everyone else already has - simply because it is our first time here.  anyway, last night went great.  I went to the disco for abit and then down to the crew bar with my friend Lisa.  My friend, the Safety Officer, he left today. Such a nice guy. I will miss him. It's so strange when you get to know people and they leave. Already 5 since I came aboard. But noone says bye, they say see you soon. Because this industry is so small you are bound to see these people again on a next contract.  OUr chief conceirge is leaving as well. She's really nice. From Portugal.   So, anyway, today we are in Acapulco. My favorite day. It's beautiful weather today. Most of my friends are all going to Wal-mart but I refuse. I want to go lay in the sun and just swim or go to a restaurant and eat some good food. (More seafood, hahah).  I am getting so tan! Already, you can tell I am in the Mexican Riviera every week.  Tomorrow Zihuatenejo. That's where the fat mermaid restaurant is. Yummy. I really need tot ake pictures of that place!  Okay, I will run for now. I hope everyone is having a lovely Sunday. I miss Sunday. Hell, I miss knowing what day of the week it is. Ok, who am I kidding here? I don't miss anything about it. It's wonderful to wake up everyday and wonder where I am in the world. I feel blessed.
