We kinda made our first song, called "Huh?" it's sweet, but we kinda wrote it in about 15 mins. We need the melody and the ska breaks now. The best song, is "Surf Wax America" by weezer. That song owns. Im horrible confused. I need still need to talk to some one.. or i might possbly go insane.  I havent seen The Brendan Leonard Show in about a week or so now. I miss it.. but I have alot of...other....things to worry about. Corey better not be acting like a jerk. He only has came to 1/2 of the practices. We need to get Dan in the band. that way someone would actually be there to play.  I cant wait for band camp...I really need to get a NEW BATHING SUIT!! Teh other one, is too, not there. And the guys will be there. Well I have to go.. I have to come up with dinner plans.
