He wouldnt move, and he wouldnt eat a dog treat or a carrot! he usually loooves them. he wouldnt even respond, like we said his name, and his eyes moved up, thats it. I think maybe he went down there to die, like, when Beauty died, she crawled under the tent trailer, cause she was outside, but he was inside, and i guess the basement is dark and secluded, isolated. He was doing better, with his steroids and all, but I hes even more sick than before. guess we'll see if he makes it through the night, he wont come upstairs, but the basement's night. its so hot in my room, i had the window open, my ceiling fan going, another floor fan going, no blanket, and had an ice cold shower before going to bed, and i was still roasting. plus, the water cooler isnt working, so ive had to drink warm water, better than nothing. but poor tosha, hes ugly, and stinky, but i love him.
