I have this huge sign on my door that says "RACHEL IS RECUPERATING" so nobody would bug me for a little while, hey maybe I might have even gotten a much needed nap in?! Worthless. Well, I put my trash outside the door, also so the maids wouldn't come in and I made a pile of books next to my bed and decided to get a quick nap in. No. Not happening. Oh course the ex here, arrived home from school, being really loud, but hey thats cool I can be loud too. Then after everyone else in the whole building including the maids who don't even speak english, got the hint, he didn't. He called my room, wtf?! I normally refer to this phone as a blaring nasty ring, because its also my alarm clock. I answered and the first thing he says is "I saw your sign." Thanks dummy but obviously you didn't. He said he was calling to see if i needed anything. Yeah, genius, to be left alone. This is a totally typical example of his having convinced himself that he is the most thoughtful person in the world. This is half the reason I dumped him in the first place. He's not, he doesn't EVER stop to think about what the other person really wants or needs or feels, i.e., he has yet to actually go through actual the motions of thoughtfulness, i.e., putting thought into something. He will see what a societally accepted thing to do is, and go into auto pilot, without thinking of what the other person needs. I told him in the beginning I had to break up with him because he had yet to think past the end of his nose. He could have ordered his own pizza last night, or he could have left be a bit more since it was mine and I was starving. Worthless.
