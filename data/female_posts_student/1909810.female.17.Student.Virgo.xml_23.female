I'm always lost, I just sit in the back with Leslie and Sarah as we laugh at ourselves because it makes no sense...and it doesn't help that Mrs. Flaccus gives this look of dissapointment when we don't understand something..i don't know what it is...it's just this...look, kind of makes me feel dumb, but I've been feeling dumb most of the year so yay for me.  It's odd..one of the classes I like the most I'm getting a B in,I don't know how that happened. This week is homecoming...Hurrah! uh...no.  I was going to Biff's after the PSAT on saturday with Leslie and NAU was getting ready to start the parade...ahh...it just made me worry that college is just going to be another high school, and I don't think I could handle that.  I   really  don't want to go to school on thursday, it's going to be dumb. Extremely short classes a pep assembly(YES!!) and a parade..woo hoo. I have so much school spirit...I need to be a cheerleader.
