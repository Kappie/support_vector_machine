I put her down and repeated the words "Ellie is tired" until she fell asleep. This took quite sometime. But she stayed asleep. Geez. Kids can be a pain after they learn to stand up. By the way, don't let me have kids. 1) Ruin my uber-sexy figure 2)I heard breast-feeding makes your boobs go away and since I don't have any, I don't think the result would be any better 3) They cry a lot. Maybe I'll adopt.
