One night a man had a dream, He dreamt that he was walking along the beach with God. Across the sky flashed scenes of his life. For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand. One belonging to him, the other to the Lord.  When the last scenes of his life flashed before him, He looked back at the footprints in the sand. He noticed that at many times in his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that this happened at the very lowest points in his life. This really bothered him and he questioned the Lord about it  "Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed at the most troublsome points in my life, There is only one set of footprints. I don't understand that when I needed you most you would leave me"  The Lord replied, "My son, my precious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During the times of trial and suffering, When you only see one set of footprints, It was then that I carried you"
