The other half of the week I spent sleping in the back of the car while my older brother, my dad, and I drove from Hamtown to Rochester, NY...then to Amherst, MA...then back to Hamtown. I went with my brother as he checked out a few colleges he's been accepted to. University of Rochester and UMASS Amherst are definitely going to be possibilities when I apply. Great schools. He chose Rochester, by the way.  On the last Saturday of vacation, I went to my second cousin's bridal shower. She's so beautiful, and I wish her and her soon-to-be husband the best. They're both the kind of people who seem slightly shy, yet polite, friendly, and engaging (no pun intended). Like...people who, though they won't tell you so, they know more about life than you do. I like those people. And it was cool to see my family. Although watching someone open gifts of kitchenware and lengerie for hours on end isn't the kind of opportunity I'd jump at any Saturday, it was great to see my cousin so happy. The day wasn't for me, it was for her, and what matters is that she enjoyed it. I think she did.   That night, I went to a dance practice for Nina's party, and she threw my a surprise birthday party. I love her. I was sitting in their basement on the couch, and her older sister Erica came in with an ice cream cake that had "Mango" written on it, and a big vanilla scented candle on top. :). Then I opened my present and card, and I have to say it again: I love Nina.   Too bad I corrupted her.  After that, Erica drove us to the Rufio/ Senses Fail concert at the Palladium, and first of all, it kicked ass. I tainted innocent Nina, and got her crowd surfing. It was good fun. I can't even remember how many times I went up that night. Then she spent the night.  Then, sunday was slightly less hectic, and on Monday: back to school.  Good times.
