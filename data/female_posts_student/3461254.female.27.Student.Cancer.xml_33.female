This weekend, I shall sink my teeth into the fourth Harry Potter book (which I'm quite looking forward to) and, er, um, uh...A Nicholas Sparks novel.    I read one of his novels about a year ago and shortly afterwards experienced internal bleeding.  My eyes also filled up with blood and I started coughing up a black, tar-like substance.  Okay, it wasn't all that bad, but it was pretty sappy and simple.  I'm reading "The Rescue" and already on page 52, I can totally foresee the ending.  Perhaps it won't be all that bad, but I'm not holding my breath.  The author's picture on the dust cover also threw me--The writing reminded me of an Andy Griffith-esque old man, not a guy looking like an old preppy kid.  This reading will not bode well on my writing plans.  If I start writing the literary equivalent of Celine Dion schmaltz, someone please put me out of my misery.
