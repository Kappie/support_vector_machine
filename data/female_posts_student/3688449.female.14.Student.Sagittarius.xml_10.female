Bascially, Ashleigh is just being a female dog (I have adults watching me type this, so I'm censoring it) and talking all kinds of crap aboutme to other people. I have been holding in a lot of things that I could have said to her to really crush her, but I'm a nice person, so I never did.    But, I was browsing through my CD collection and I came across my Destiny's Child CD. There is this song on there that just blew me away with how similiar it was to how I felt about Ashleigh. So, I'll show y'all the song, but I had to tweak it a bit because some of the lines wouldn't have made sense with the situation we're in. So...here it is...Fancy, by Destiny's Child!     I don't fancy you too much, child    I don't fancy you too much.    You think you're cute, you think you're fine,    You're always trying to steal my shine,    Get off of me, don't mess with me,    You know who you are.        I've always been so nice to you, girl    Helping you, girl, there for you girl,    You've always tried to compete with me, girl,    Using me, girl, abusing me, girl.    Flirting with every man you see,    Especially if the man likes me.    Baby where's your self-esteem?    Find your own identity...        You're a liar and a cheater,    And I dont want you no more, (lol, grammar, I know...)    Don't come hanging around my door,    I don't what you came here for,    If you didn't know, then now you know...        I don't fancy you too much, child,    I don't fancy you too much.    You think you're cute, you think you're fine    You're always trying to steal my shine,    Get off of me, don't mess with me,    You know who you are.        Roll those eyes girl, twist them hips girl,  Swing those hands all in the air.  If you wonder why you never had a best friend, I think I made myself clear.  Girl change your ways right now today,  Stop hating me, baby find your own identity!  You're a liar and a cheater.  I don't want you no more,  Don't come knockin' at my door  Don't know what you came here for, if you didn't know then now you know...        I don't fancy you too much, child,  I don't fancy you too much.  You think you're cute, you think you're fine  You're always trying to steal my shine,  Get off of me, don't mess with me,  You know who you are.       So, yah, that's basically the whole song, even though I chopped like half of it out. But, that's bascially how I feel but, there is more. Um, I'm also doing this just to update my blog since Joy keeps bugging me about it. ^_^    BTW, Happy belated birthday, Joy! Even though I was the first one to tell you happy b-day "officially" at 12:00 am. Welcome to being 14 years old. Trust me, it's really nothing to celebrate...I hope you had a fun birthday and by the way you wrote it on your blog, it seems like you had a fun time.    I think that might be it for this post, so, remember to VOTE KERRY! And stay away from Ashleigh...LEBIF!
