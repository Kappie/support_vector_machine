That would be great, except for she considers quality time to be shopping at save-a-lot, which tends to attract retarded, disabled, maimed, and otherwise unsightly people. To try and speed things up, Ioffered to go ahead and get certain things, but she was like "No, there's specifickinda I need...and you know how your grandpa is.." And THEN, in the meed section,she holds this..this...THING, in my face...and I didn't get a verygood look at it, but I thought it was a penis...turned out it was a pigs foot > ....... ....... Our endeavors were unsuccessful.  So we went to ANOTHER hardware store, where she argued in a very loud waywith a very hot hardware-store guy (I LOVE the guys that work in hardware stores..they're so manly...besides the old thick-glasses guy anyway) about the weed b gone...When she walked away I whispered "Forgive her, she's old.." He smiled, buh that was all. Have I mentioned I realleh dun look my best today either? I've lost weight and don't have any clothes that fit..and my hair was wet..and it was humid out so the usually lovely locks went insane...so yeah, definitely no boyscouting today.
