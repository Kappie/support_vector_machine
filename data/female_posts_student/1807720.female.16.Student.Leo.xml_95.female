I was trying to do that trig assignment, the review trig stuff and I can't even remember how to do that.  How sad is that, I can't even do the review.  I can't finish my homework either cause I don't understand it.  It's frustrating.  I want to do so good on that test monday but it's hard to keep the hope that I can do good if I don't understand.  I tried out my chem homework today too, those ICE chart things don't make any sense.  I think she tried to explain them too fast or something.  I mean she sure knew what she was doing, but we don't.  I finished my religion project but now I have to study for dumb social.  I HATE social.  It's stupid and pointless and a waste of my life.  I have better things to do other than stuff about the past.  Why the hell do I need to know anything about that past, it's not like knowing WWI is really going to make some smart person or something.  I should get back to my social.  I keep avoiding it but it has to be done eventually and well I need to try figure out my math but if I don't hand in all my homework on monday I don't want marks taken off.  It's not that fact that I don't want to do my homework, I just don't know how to do it.
