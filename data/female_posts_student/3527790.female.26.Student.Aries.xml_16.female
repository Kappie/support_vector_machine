Warmed,    By the suns fingers,    That pokes and prods,    Into the depths of the,    Murky pools that; Babbles,    Eagerly down to the streambed,    Rushing to tell stories to the patient ear,    That listens,    As water; Giggles,    Tickled by the grass that lazily bends in the wind,    Barely etching the waters skin as it; Spinning,    Tossed about by rocks,     And pebbles that lie,    In its way. It laps at my toes.
