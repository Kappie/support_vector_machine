We put our legs through the arm holes in our lifejackets and were walkin around like they were  diapers ...haha. I got me a lil tan! We came back to her house and prank called like 30 people. It was hilarious. I met this new kid that's coming to our school from Patterson, his name's Josh. Come to find out that night that the same place where we went in the boat to guys died. They were supposedly playing chicken in boats and one got charged with a DWI, two girls are in the hospital, but should be okay. The next day, after getting about 2 hours of sleep, cause everyone kept calling my cell all night. We got 3 wake-up calls at like  6 30 in the morning ...we were at the Honda place for 7 30 to get Jen's car fixed after getting us some hashbrowns! We waited for 2  hours  and then they tell us that they don't have the right part! OMG! We were so  mad ! Then we went to school to get Jen's schedule changed and they conncelor's were in a meeting so we went to her aunt's house where her sis was babysitting and took a nap...and  overslept  and jumped in the car half asleep barely being able to stand up. Then we went to school and waited for the football players to get out of practice...I fell asleep in the car, and got woken up by 7 of them jumping on me and all over the car. What a  wonderful  way to wake up...right. Then they were taking too long and we brought Joey to Dularge, came back to my house and grubbed. Then we went to the ortho for Jen, and went back to school to change her schedule. Then we brought Chelsea Falcon home. JOY. Then we went to Jen's house got some money out the change bottle thing and went get a snowball with our loose change. YUM! Then we went fill up her tank with nothing but  quarters, dimes, and nickels ...DICKLES! It was sooo funny! Then we went back to her house and chilled. Went get her sis at her aunt's, and they dropped me off cause they had swim practice. What a adventurous day! HAHAHA. Today...I did...absolutly...nothing....except laundry....WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
