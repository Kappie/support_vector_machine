His name is Andy. He is 16, blueish green eyes, dirty blonde hair, and a really nive body. He's pretty skinny, and I dont really like skinny guys, but I can make an exception. ;) But im gonna try to get Rusty to bring him more often. We just chilled and talked and stuff. Then me and Lauren came home and talked and watched tv and went to sleep. Then we woke up at 9 this morning, got ready to go, went to the mall, then I went back to her house, and then I came home. We wrapped Justin's birthday presents. He is soooo hard to buy for. My goodness. It was crazy. I'll write about what we got him a little later. But, Im wiped out. I had to fix dinner tonight... well, its cooking. Maybe thats what that burning smell is. Hmmmmm
