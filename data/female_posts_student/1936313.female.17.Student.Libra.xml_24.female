Pictures are coming, I promise, as soon as I find the usb thinger to hook up my camera. If not I'll get them all printed out then try and find a scanner and scan them all in. BTW: I'm lazy and instead of repeating past posts... just...read em yourselves and I'll reference ya to em..  Reference 1: Read the one from March 21st for Flight over and the Wedding. I can't much add to that about the wedding except show pictures.. which I will as soon as I get them onto the computer. Maybe I'll ask for a disc or something...  So the wedding was on the 20th.. the 21st was recupperating... We spent a day in Liverpool... I don't quite like Liverpool... we ended up at a museum (surprise surprise... its my Uncle Mikes favorite thing in the world to do.... that and our family history... Sidebit: Get new job fast so its not permanently written in his books that I worked at McDonalds).  Somewhere in there was a shopping trip the Trafford Centre, which is the massive shopping centre near Manchester. (My Aunt and Uncle whom I was staying with live in Denton, which is part of Greater Manchester) I got my gold shoes for grad, but they've been kind-of ruined by rain. (How so you ask? When loading our baggage somewhere along the line they were left out in the open rain on the tarmack. So its got this kinda stain... you dun really notice it when I put em on though sooooo I won't throw a fit.. and it may yet come out.)  Went rock climbing as well.. did I mention that? It was fantastic!!! Hah.. but when they found out we were from Canada they all started asking if we ski or snowboarded... to which we (Andrew and I) blinked blankly and shook our heads... to which they exclaimed over how could we possible have all that snow and not go out in it. --Very Easily..... ITS DAMNED COLD!!!-- heh.. I shall add in for kicks that our trainer was veeeeery nice looking hehe which unfortunately did not make me climb any better... It was a weird system... they had weird harnesses I'm not used to... they didn't give you climbing shoes, so your climbing in your runners... and they give you helmets... (In Canada we don't get a helmet but we get proper climbing shoes.. which makes it a LOT easier)  Stratford.. hmm... Romeo and Juliet FANTASTIC.. see March 30th entry for more on the driving etc. "TANK CROSSING" btw.. while in Stratford we were jumping ahead of 16+ schoolgroups (half of which were entirely French) the entire time. The Bed and Breakfast we stayed in was very nice. Very nice.... and no... not only because of the owners son.. -ducks and hides-  I also got my grad ring... heh... I don't have a ring anymore...Mom got me an opal (which is my birthstone) ring when I was 9. She always used to say that opals were unlucky... which is COMPLETELY TRUE, especially for Sherlocks. (ex. my opal stone once cracked.. we had it replaced.. once fell out of its setting.. I luckily found it outside my locker... we had it put back in.... and then 3rd times the charm.. it utterly shattered.... and My Aunt Leslie had an opal engagement ring which she lost and had to have replaced twice) - - - Back to my grad ring.. its of BlueJohn Stone... which you can only find in England... its a pretty bluey-purple with a stainless steel setting and I love it to death, not sure yet if I'm getting an engraving or anything put in it.  The Blue John mines were umm... not for the weak of heart (which they had a medical notice at the top) you climb down stairs..... into a dark cavern with low ceiling and narrow passages (Dad was walking sideways half the time) going downs okay... one guy slipped on the stairs but he was okay... we were luckily far enough from him that it did not have a dominoe effect and trip us all up. Very dark and scary... but our tour guide was very friendly and had some great stories to tell us. I'll not recant them all... despite the walk back up those damnable stairs (which takes twice as long as going down) I highly recommend anyone visiting England to stop by the BlueJohn mines.  We then went to Lincolnshire (well that kinda area... it was actually Scunthorpe.... but we're not going even think about Scunthorpe (its as bad a place as the name sounds... total industry all over the place... 6 power plants within 5 miles) My Uncle David and Aunt Leslie live there and we stayed for a weekend. Went out for dinner heh.. my cousin Becky brought baby William after work (I repeat again he is the most sweetest baby in the world... he didn't cry once and we were in a rather fancy restaurant... he has the most infectous laugh ever..) Pictures of him will come soon as well.  Flight home was a terror and a half. Flight to London - peaceful. Flight to Toronto - FROM HELL! 7 hrs of jackass boys sitting behind me who had the little cliche of friends crowding around their seats, I couldn't sleep. Flight to Edmonton - I was okay sitting at the gate... closed my eyes, decided I'd be fine so long as I could sleep this last leg of the journey..... awakened by none other then THE SAME DAMN SCHOOL GROUP!!! grrrrr... Riverside School... grrrrrr.... pox on them! or something like that....  Link thats that.... heh... I'm sure i'm leavin huge gaps.. but pictures will fill them in.. I promise.
