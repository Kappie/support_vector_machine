Summer is so wonderful for me. It's like a drug...an addiction. I soak it in to my skin so deep, I let it creep through my body, I let it take it's full effect. I just sit back as it strolls by. And when it's gone I feel as though I need it. I have to have it. I can't go a day without it. And I trudge mournfully through winter until summer comes back again. I love summer. I'm so happy. Everything about it is absolutely amazing.  Cha-ching.  Well the mellow-ness is gone. Kinda. I'm just sorta insane now. As usual. Bah hah.  Get your gay ass algebra projects done, crazies.
