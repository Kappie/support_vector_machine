But it can be argued, quite successfully, that I was an even bigger dork in my younger days.  From 8th Grade through Junior year of high school, I wore braces.  And then for 6 joyous years after that, I was stuck with a retainer.  And though there's no longer anything hard-wired into my mouth, every so often I can feel things shifting, so I have to pop the metal top retainer and a plastic molded lower one back in for a day or two.  Today was one such joyous occasion.  And so, I once again look like the Math Club nerd that I truly am, with the bonus perks of having my teeth hurt like hell and sporting a lovely speech impediment from not being used to having this stuff in my mouth.  Blah.  To think my parents shelled out $3K for this... well I guess it is better than how my teeth looked before I got hooked up with the hardware.  That smile could have given Jewel a run for her money.  Eep.  And from the realm of "truly bad news," here's a nugget pulled straight from the website of Tweeter Center Chicago (it's still The World, dammit):    Tailgating and drinking are not permitted in Tweeter Center parking lots, per a Village of Tinley Park ordinance. A wide variety of food and beverages are available inside the Tweeter Center before and during every performance.    Well, so much for that grand idea.  Looks like the options go back to either hanging out at my house before the show and drinking cheap/free, or trying to catch a buzz off of the $9 beer at The World, which I think can be nominated for WORST IDEA EVER.  If I have to shell out $9.00 for a single beer (and fecking Coors, no less!), then I'll just settle for the contact high I'm bound to get from sitting on the lawn.  And if there's no pre-show drinky over at my house, then what shall become of the Woodchucks?  I don't want to drink them alone - that's a special occasion beverage.  Maybe I can just save them for the next time Grey has a free moment on a weekend.  But I don't know if they'll still be fresh by the time 2007 rolls around.
