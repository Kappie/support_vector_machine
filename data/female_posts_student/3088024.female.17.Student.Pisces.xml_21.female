Well I chose Setve Job's Macworld Expo keynote speech...Wow it was two hours long...Very charismatic though...made me want a G5...during the keynote he had a few of people come on stage to talk about their product.  The only one I can remember is the Microsoft Office 2004 lady because she was SOOOO drunk.  I mean she was swaying ALOT and just looked plastered.  I couldn't believe it.  If she was sober, and that was Microsoft's best, they have some problems...Well at least I got some work done while I watched.  I learned what teraflop means too.  Cool word.  Tro, teraflop,... this week had some good "t" words.
