She's pretty and so talented..  Gasps * :D By the way, today's LIFESTYLE papers rated  The Apprentice  4 out of 5 stars! I hope I'll have time to watch the next coupla' episodes though, because the term 3 exams begin next week.   I just got back from Daddy's club and the weather was really good so I went for a swim. Before that my relatives and I had a prayer session for my Grandfather cos it's his 1st death anniversary. * Sniffle * Then we headed to Aunty Mary's place (Yes that Aunty who gave me that TYR swimsuit for free *smmucks*) for buffet lunch. So yes, yet another sinful sinful meal..   I can't wait for school tomorrow! I miss my friends so much! I miss Nana and Fiona the most! * Mucho kisses and hugs! *  [4b1'04] Seig H a il!
