I broke things off with eric... but i think that it was mutual... kayt told me that he said he was going to break things off anyway... because he didnt want a serious relationship in high school... or something... i dont know... But the more that i try to move on... the more i dont want to let go.  It's not fair... i wanted eric... i wanted things to work with him... i loved him... love him actually... and its just not fair...  I dont understand how i always end up the one that gets hurt... i wasnt supposed to be the one that got hurt out of all of this... thas not how it was supposed to go.  I mean i obviously didnt want to hurt him... but i wasnt supposed to be the one that got hurt out of all of this.  I love how all guys tell you that they wont hurt you... that they arent like the rest... but i still always end up being the one that is hurt and crying in the end.  I just dont understand... he told me that he still loves me... that he always will... and like even when we're talking or something, he'll tell me that he loves me and cares about me... but then y didnt he fight... what made it not worth fighting for anymore... i guess that i need to keep telling myself that this was still a lot of his parent's decisions... but ugh... i just dont know... i just... i wanted it to work... we were so great together... i mean it all just came out of no where... but it was all so great...   Now i've been hanging out with andy... and andy is awesome, but i mean i think that i really need to just tell him that we need to slow down and just hang out and stuff for awhile, cuz i still have to get over all of this.  It seems like thas all i ever do... go out with someone and then get over them... im always in one of those two phases, there really isnt any other phase... and i kinda wish there was... but i guess im just not capable of staying single... or something... i dunno.  Or maybe i am capable of staying single, but anytime that im single, im getting over someone... i dunno, thas a lot to think about... and i dont really have the strength right now.  The only thing that i know for certain right now is that i miss eric... i didnt want things to end with him.  But yet i have to move on... i am certain of that too... i just know that the beginning of school is going to be horrible... I'll just have to stay strong... i mean if i could deal with going to school and bein in the same classes as J the day after we broke up... i think that i can deal with seeing eric... Last nite kayt and i were outside watching the meteor shower and we were just sitting there talking.  And i brought up eric and i said something about how i wondered if he was going to go bac to being just "that kid" and she said that she hoped he didnt... and then i said that i hoped he did... and then the tears just started streaming down my face... And all of the questions... what have i done? did i do this for the right reasons? can i fix it? should i fix it? how would i fix it?... i dont feel like i can talk to anyone about any of this... i mean i love kaytlin dearly, but i always just feel so bad/weird talking to her about my guy problems... becuz i know how fed up she gets with me... and she is on the outside, and she sees the logical side of all of it... but i cant see the logical side of any of it... all i see is emotion... my head doesnt make decisions for me anymore, just my heart does, its in full control of my body... I dont know what to do anymore... i dont know what to think or to feel... im in a huge mess... i dont know how to get myself out... where to even begin... i know that i either will have to hurt more people, or myself... or both... thas how it always goes... which way to turn... i do not know...
