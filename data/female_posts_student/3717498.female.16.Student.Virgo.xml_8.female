With one client I'll call Mary, it took great patience and lots of long, uneasy silences to begin to separate out her true desires from those of her peers and parents. But if she continues to do this, and withstands pressure from others to conform, she'll be a much healthier young adult with a strong sense of her own identity.    apperently as me friend told me...people from ages 16 - 18 go through some identity crisis..and then from 18 -20.. the find their true selves...? makes sense sort of considering the fact i am turning 17 and thorughout gr 11 i didn't kno wat the hell was going on and i acutally got depressed...but anyways..i came up with the question after hearing that..who am i anyways? like i really dont' know..and i thought i knew...liek i thought i was: funny, hardworking, trustworthy, friendly pssibly in a mean blunt way, tomboy ish..but some how sort of sensitive in a feminine way?...i dont' kno anymore like...it was almost as if i was aiming towards those traits...maybe that is what makes me ME...finding what i think to be the best trait and trying to be that..but then it will not be ME...so if i jsut sit back and try to go with the flow it wouldnt' work cuz in every situation..we need to bring up some type of trait..liek pessimistic, optimistic, mean, kind, calm, relaxed, manic, pisseed or hwatever...but u kind of decide (well at least me) according to what will give me the most attention or power...so does that make me a spotlight lover and power hungry? (I sound like a Leo).. I dont' know..maybe i am jsut imature or soemthing like that..have no idea ..so then apprently according  to this identity crisis we are suppose to look up to someone ..liek a role model...and thats how i figured that i wanted to have an older sister..or even a younger one so maybe she can somehow look up to me...but i prefer an older sister..u kno..even if we may fite all the time..i kno that it would definitely have a HUGE impact on me...maybe to be more 'girly'..i don't kno...see then i have this wierd desire to be mroe girly..but i don 't kno if it would be me....like sometimes i wish i would start puttin make up on.. .but i am too scared cuz i got that little crazy tomboy image..and it would seem weird...and i hate it when everyoe dotes on me for having these weird 'girly' coments. hm so i figure..i do wish to be more feminen...weird..ok also i think the reason i am so addicted to emode..cuz it tells me so much about myself..sometmies it hink that i conform myself so i would meet those traits cuz according to that site, i am some crazy bubly person..i mean i guess i do like meeting people alhtought i have this weird shy trait about me...well i kno for sure that i liked to be looked upon as someone who is funny, and a good friend, and somewhat deeply intelectual and knowledgeable on politics..meh but that is what i am trying to do but i sometimes jsu don't freaking kno...meh...argh..and they say we are suppose to have fun at this age..not that i am not..but liek after 3 days in a row goin out...i started getting bored of that HIGH feeling of happiness and carefreeness in teh world..like i want something more....i can't get enuf of it...maybe it is GOD?..probably..but like i want MORE MORE MORE.....i am not even if like love from someone i wnat bad can fil that weird void up...i mean face it ... i sort of got everything that like a teenager can want compared to some...family, friends, stuff liek htat..but i still feel stupid....and i still want MORE MORE..i am starting to find materialistic things  make me happy ..but then they only last for a whiel..and u get bored of them and u just wnat MORE MORE and MORE...hmm and these days..i am not as strong willed to my opinions as i used to be..i get shot easily and jsut sink and turn red...doepz    the blood shot sky fades towards the nite every creature on the earth nests towards home where they belong and don't have to worry about a thing because lucky for them, God intended them to be different from humans wihtout minds, without fate   hehe still trying to improve on my poetry skills  [confused]
