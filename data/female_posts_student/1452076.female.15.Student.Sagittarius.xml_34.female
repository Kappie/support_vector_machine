This book is a trilogy set which compiles his auto-biographies of three different segments of his life, namely his childhood, his teenage years, and his early adult life. The first two books were captivating. The last part was just a boring conclusion to everything. There were no more explicit descriptions of how his deranged mother abused him and how he fought to survive even when he was all alone. Unlike the first two, which was what kept me hooked onto them.  I've started on Mitch Albom's 'The Five People You Meet In Heaven' two days back. Inside, Eddie, the guy who dies and goes to Heaven, meets his first mentor -- The Blue Man. He said something so provoking, yet in a way, so true. 'Strangers are just family you've yet to meet.' This led me to think about a certain bogus theory which states that everyone is linked to everyone else in the world by six people. Which means, I know someone > who knows someone > who knows someone > who knows someone > who knows someone > who knows Brad Pitt! Or Saddam Hussein. Or Madonna. But why do I need to know them anyway. This theory sounds more amazing if we put it in another way. We're all descendants of Adam and Eve -- Doesn't this just directly make us all brothers and sisters by blood? Now who says I have a small social circle?  Anyway, less crapping. I hope I don't get stuck on this new book for too long. I want to read Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. Everyone is talking about it. I'm sure it's going to be a good novel with an exciting plot.
