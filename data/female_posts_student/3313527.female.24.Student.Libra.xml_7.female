When I'm struggling with my own identity, these are some simple titles that bring me comfort (I am some of these things all the time, and some of them switch with my mood):  artist, writer, student, lefty (both politically and with regards to handedness), musician, yogini, yoga teacher, woman, critic, friend, lover, buddhist, libra, vegetarian, anarchist, quaker, traveler .   Ahh... there's some comfort to be taken in such simple, black-and-white titles on days when all identity feels false, lost, and compromised. These words are woefully inadequate when it comes to describing who I  truly  am, my essence, my spirit, my soul, et al, but somewhere at the intersection of them all lies a hint of the way in which  I am one unique breath of Spirit breathing Life . So one might say that all of these titles are emptiness, and represent me clinging to an identity whose true nature is empty, yadda yadda. I say,  if you play the game knowing it's a game, then all will come out in the wash .
