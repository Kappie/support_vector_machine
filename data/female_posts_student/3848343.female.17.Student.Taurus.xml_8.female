As i was bumming round with kate waiting for bridey i turn to see what was a glimpse of b walking towards us and turn back to kate and said "had bridey dyed her hair dark or is it just me"...i was right....it is now a bluey-black,...looks like black with blue streaks,... HOT STUFF ...apparetnly she didnt even know it was blue till we told her lol.As we walked to school i thought we cant all walk into school together as we all have dark almost balck hair now hahah...I aint a goth...i duno about the other two tho....i did here about some kinda of goat sacrafice that they perfomed last week but i duno...dunt ask, they might put a hex on you!..lol.jksjks girls...To start school off i went and dropped extension english (im sorry Sanja and Lala, i just aint that bright...We will always have the chicken tho.....BBEECCKKKEERRKK  {thats a chicken sound} ...bloody dickheads)...Well the rest of the School daywas GREAT.... HARDLY ....the day went suprisingly quickly for me, except forin maths with kim where we did nothing, and in Modern with Sanja and Sarah where we did nothing and in Design and Tech where i helped jess pretend to do something lol....Last period was tutorial where we learnet about Alcohol and the effects on ur body -  A LIL LATE!!!  did u know that once drinking you find the opposite sex another 25% more attractive then usual....that answered alot of questions for people...hahah aye girls lol...another conclusion i came too, if ur a girl with high standards just be permanantly drunk and then im sure you will find someone that wets ur whistle lol....so to speak! Over all the day was good cause i got to see people i had missed all holidays and well others i hadnt missed..nahnha i love you all!....i reckon the highlight of the day tho was when jenny got her book 'Black Africa" and smashed it over charles head (so maybe u will here of us terrorising asains in todays blog hahah)!!!! -  HILARIOUS ... yeh so once school was over i walked home to mums, on the way i got credit but, wOoHoO...since theni have been sitting around lol doing umm...i duno what...but yeh time is still passing by and running out lol  [+] things im counting down till     my birthday  - 283 days till i turn 18...woohoo then me and beldon are going to Oatley pub to get pissed at lunch..= )    till year 12's leave  - thats less then 50 days     till im in year 12 -  just over 84 days, then there is no more mucking around we finally have to do what the teachers have been "preparing" us for for the last 12 years hahaha.    till the end of school -  just over 4 terms left till we have no more school, how nerve racking, how exciting but    im not sure what else im counting down till but im sure there is heaps more stuff!!!
