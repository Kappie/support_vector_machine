Today Mike, Gavin and I drove down to UH to pay the cursed parking ticket, with full intentions of stopping by the Children's Center to check out the facilities for Gavin. We did not. After an hour of hiking all over campus, we limped back to the car and melted, our bellies churning uncomfortable from an unusually bad lunch at the food kiosk. I had sat, eating my tough pieces of meat (debating quietly as to whether it was horse or cat meat - I somehow imagine cat meat to resemble chicken, but it is a red meat after all... I digress) and I gazed whistfully up at the sun-dappled stairs of the Hamilton Library, in whose bowels I will live like a troll for the next year and a half.   Safely home, Gavin and I played on the porch with his kitty litter box filled with cool water. He tip-toed on the hot cement, and then crammed his body into the box to splash happily while I hovered over him, my shadow shielding him from the blazing sun, and my back burning. I'll miss these days. I had a vision, suddenly, of myself on a bike, Gavin riding behind me in a baby seat, as I cruised toward his day care center to drop him off for my class, then riding on to the library, then picking up the boy and gliding down to the lovely olympic-sized heated pool for an afternoon swim. Perhaps I'll ask for a bike for my birthday, it's been so long since I've been on one.  My mother returns now from the store, with the fixings to make fresh fudge, which she has been longing for these past two days. As she's suffering from a severe migraine, we've decided that this sounds like a good pain-killer.  Ah, life.
