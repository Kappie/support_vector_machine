Michael Buckley and I resolved our differences, lol, it turns out that he didn't really tell Adam Havens that i was stalking him but rather that he had a whole bunch of girls that think he's hott and came to his house at a birthday party and when Adam asked Michael if any of them were cute, my name was the first that popped into Buckley's head to tell him. So its not all bad right? Buckley said that i shouldn't even bother coming to the hockey games this year for Coppell because we lost like half our team. I dunno, i think i'll still go if school doesn't conflict. yeah so then afterwards, i went to Nadia's house to check out her camp pictures and then i ended up spending the night. We watched "Spice World", just so we could relive our childhoods. That movie was sooo funny and retarded at the same time, i think i'm going to ask for it for christmas just so i can have it. We also watched our usual show, Forensic Files. We crashed around 1am because i was sooo tired.  Tuesday: Second day of AcDec camp! It was hilarious because when we were playing this game thingie on introducing people, Sirisha introduced Kristen Berry as "This is Kristen Berry, she likes to get married and have lots of kids". LOL!! And of course everyone gave me a hard time because they  claim  i look like Lindsay Lohan, Sitara didn't help. I gave Sitara a hard time because she didn't know that Wayne Gretzky, the Great One and the Messiah of Hockey, was a hockey player. Then me, sarah and steph went to the dollar movie theatre for 50 cent Tuesday and saw "Mean Girls". That movie was pretty racy (sp?) for a pre-teen movie!!! I mean every other word is "bitch", "slut" or "whore"! I mean i still liked it and thought it was funny, but holy crap! Oh yeah and they're all talking about being half-virgins and virgins and non-virgins or dykes or whatever! i'm looking around me and pretty much everyone in there is either an adult or around the ages of 7-12!!! So i dunno, maybe that movie was more meant for high school kids not middle school kinda like it was advertised. I then came home and my Coupling Season 3 dvd and my new Dashboard Confessional cd came in, so i watched/listened to them for the rest of the day. oh yeah and Connor (the guy from the wedding) called and we're going to do something eventually....he said maybe on wednesday.  Today!: Last Day of AcDec camp! After our workshop thing, alot of us went to 7 Salsas and cracked each other up. We had a dance party in the bathroom to Latino music, it was awesome. Connor and I are supposed to go do something this afternoon/tonight but who knows, he's supposed to call me.  I have work Thursday and Friday and on friday i will have money!!! So that means i get gasoline for danny (the el car-o!)!!!!  Oh yes and just to spread the word: everyone remember that bitch of a freshman that accused masengill of indencency with a child? well, she's at it again because apparently there is this 2 year period in which she can refile the charges after masengill is let off. Why we have this in our judicial system, i have no idea, but its there and she refiled. Jess and I have a theory about why she's doing this: 1) if she didn't refile the charges, she has the possibility of being charged with purgery (i think thats what its called, but in other words, she's charged for lying) and 2) she's refiling in the summer so there's a small chance that anyone will really find out about it and he can't get as much support, not to mention the fact that all the seniors are leaving pretty much as of next week and they were our biggest supporters. Of course, this is our own speculation. There is also rumour going around that she really did make it all up and she told someone. If you were a witness to her saying that or you've heard that from someone else that's friends with her, please tell me. His trial before the Grand Jury is August 3rd, and i'm going to get more info on how we can help him. There is also rumour of a rally at an unnamed location, but no idea if thats actually going to happen. Please write more letters if possible, if you have the address, if not, email me at  urlLink merc_o@lycos.com  and i'll get it to you.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
