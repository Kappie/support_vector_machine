She thought almost everything was taken care of and I told her it would have been, but I opted not to use the parent loan of about $8,000. She reminded me of all the lovely things she hates about me comparing me to my brothers and various other people she usually loathes, but now wishs she had them instead. Then of course, she had to remind me of what a disappointment I am and how she has been calculating how much she has spent on me during the past years, and all the times I helped oput (which was every paycheck since I began working) would never amount to the debt and how she wishes she hadn't because I am not worth it again. She has told me that she refuses any help, money, even her name or signature. She also said, no matter what happens to me when I get out of this house she won't give a flying *bleep* because it doesn't matter to her anymore. That was my fun filled morning. Hmm... why do I keep getting depressed?????
