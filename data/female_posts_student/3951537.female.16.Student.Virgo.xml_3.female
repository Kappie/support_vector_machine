AUGH.  and now for something completely different.  I was walking my dog today in the park and this couple with a little girl came and stared at my dog for like 15 minutes, talking about "him".  first off, my dog is not a "him".  okay, to be fair I don't blame them for that.  i do, however, blame them for feeling like it's perfectly all right to stare at people.  ITS NOT A ZOO.
