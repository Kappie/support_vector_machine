Something about Lisa's general avoidance of life lately has been affecting my energy for the worse. I feel lethargic and unmotivated; or at least more so than normal. I think that's why I had a migraine today, but a very minor one. Migraines are like warning signals from my brain that I'm not taking proper care of myself. So I took some aspirin and drank a ton of water, and I felt better within an hour. Later Alex called me because I had a depressed away message on yahoo messenger (I only have it to talk to her), which was unusually compassionate and kind of her. But then I realized the only reason she called was to talk about her. She's having a boy, which actually depresses me, because now I know she's going to name him SOB Jr. which freaks me out. I don't want that child to have to symbolize all of what is wrong with Alex's life for me. But I already feel like he does. Weird to gender classify an unborn child. Also, Alex told me that SOB and she are going to move to Humbolt, so SOB can get a second bachelor's degree. First of all, like they need more debt, second, I bet he just wants to go so he can keep an eye on Alex around all those college boys. Come on now, we all know she doesn't like boys that young. She wants 'em old enough to work with her daddy complex. God, she's so creepy. Oh, and I'm her only friend. She doesn't know who else to invite to her party besides me. It makes me feel sad, because we aren't that close anymore. There's a barrier between us that I'm not sure will dislodge anytime soon.
