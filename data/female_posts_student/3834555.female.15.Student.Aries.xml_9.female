It was like i was at the 4h of July thing with Kasey but it was at MY house... like all the same people were there, but then Satan came and took over my house and everyone here... and he was making us paint the WHOLE house black and like everyone gave their souls to the Devil and even Kasey did! and i wouldnt bow down so Satan turned Kasey on me and was like "she HAS to bow down" and i was like trying to tell Kasey that Satan was bad but Kasey just smacked me to the ground and was like "BOW TO HIM!" and i tried to run away and when i was like running out the door Kasey grabbed my hair and slit my wrist and then Satan grabbed me and was like raping me and whispering in my ear "come daughter and you can have the love you wanted for so long" and Kasey was in the background like chanting and watching Satan violate me and then Kasey came and slit my other wrist right then i looked up and i saw Lindseys face but as an angel and Jesus was by her side and Lindsey just shook her head at me and reached out to help me but then Satan grabbed me and threw me into Kasey and he slit my throat and i layed in is arms bleeding to death.. but like the whole time i was dying Lindsey and Jesuslooked down on me and cried.... i woke up twiching and i was sooo freaked out... like i want to call Kasey and Lindsey sooo bad but it was like 7:00am and Lindsey was sleeping and Kasey's at his gradparents house... i almost cried... these nightmares i have been having are starting to freak me out... like i dont want to go to bed but i feel so sick on theinside, i really need sleep... i really want to go to be with Lindsey:*( she makes life seem so much...happier for me.
