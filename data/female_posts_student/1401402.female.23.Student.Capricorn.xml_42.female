( Thats It?) I dont have to log in with my user name or a password anymore. Now, I can just turn the computer on and place my thumb on the identix pad and it will automatically scan then log me in. Cool huh? I thought it was tite! Dell is the shit. Go Dell, go Dell, its your birthday hheheheh. Too much coffee for me today. I'm in La La land again.   Aye Aye, since my finger print can be identified at work, does this mean the police department get it as well? Holly shit I better not do anything illegal. Forreals.
