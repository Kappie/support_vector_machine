Sheesh, calm your nerves. and my GOD these people. I need to get out of this house before I am tempted to commit suicide just so they can leave me alone! Its fustrating and heartbreaking. I just need a vaction from them. Especially from my nephew. He gets everything he wants and ignores everything I say as if I'm their fucking maid and I'm below him! Damn house, damn people!!! What did I do in my past life worthy of this hell? HUH? Someone tell me please!! (Not really that was a retorical question) I'm gonna go watch one life to live and all my children. It'll help me calm my nerves. Or at least not want to kill someone.
