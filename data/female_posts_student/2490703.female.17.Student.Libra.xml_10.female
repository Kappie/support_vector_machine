I ran up to take a quick shower and I got into the bathroom when I realized I forgot a towel. I ran into the laundry room and I dad pushed my little brother into the bathroom. I was like what the heck?! He started yelling at me like everything was my fault. I was crying my eyes out. I told my mom later that I didn't want my dad at my graduation because he hasn't cared about me for the past 13 years, why does he all the sudden care? I don't want him to ruin one of the most important days of my life. I just don't want to go through the crap that I have been on graduation day. I now know why Travis hates dad so bad, he's such a jerk. I was looking back and my dad has never cared, or hardly cared. I remember when I told him I was excited to graduate and move on with my life and he kicked me into the refrigerator and Travis saved me from further beating. Or how he was always too busy to go to soccer games or track meets. He never came to any. How sad is that? I remember him telling me that no matter what I did, nothing I ever did would be good for him. It made me so sad. People seem to say that to me a lot in my life. It seems like no one really loves me, they just love to see me hurt a lot. It's such crap. I'm just glad that I have you for a friend to get me through the tough times. I don't know where I would be with out you. I spent the day up at MSU with Amanda and all of her friends there. I didn't really fit in because I'm such a minor, but it was better then the family ward and home. Isn't is sad to say that any place is better than home. I was always taught home should be a safe place...so much for that. I just hope things get better...Trials make you stronger, but I'm done with that! I need some smooth sailing...maybe a boyfriend that treats me well. Yeah right, funny joke. I hate being so NEGATIVE! I found this guy though who fits the profile... 1. He has VERY nice shag hair...SO HOT! 2. He plays guitar...or and he sings! 3. He is a skateboarder!  On top of all that, he is so nice and he is good looking which is a bonus. haha... I miss you so much. If you come up this summer we'll have to hang out and TP people. It'll be so much fun. Hate crimes rock my world. But I have to go hun. JASON is online acting like David again and I really can't deal with him again. I love you girl. Talk to you soon!  Peace and Love,   Melissa
