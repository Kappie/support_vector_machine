Here is what I mean: In english, she has only graded TWO vocab packets. Okay, so I have a hundred percent, just like everybody else. But still, that's really lame.  In Spanish, we have a total of 3 grades, one of which is a quiz I forget we had and ended up with a D on. So now I have a 79%. And it's still a goddamn C+, harumph! Why can't she include my project in it; that so would've given me at least a B. Oh well.  Funny thing is, the rest of my grades are fine and well, yay, just those two are completely off the spectrum. Damn teachers never grading their shizzle.  Oh, and in my history grade, it doesn't show that he graded the newest essay. Just the quizes he handed back. Annoying how even though I got no less than a B on the last 3, my grade stayed almost exactly the same.  I'm not asking anyone to contribute their grades or anything, but I was just rather dissappointed that the grades right now are no where near a good evaluation of our learning, since that is what they should be. Makes me tsk tsk a bunch.
