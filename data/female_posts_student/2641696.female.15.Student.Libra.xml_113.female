Actually I woulda had to stay here anyway (my sister is staying 'till 4:30 for some unknown reason), but I like blaming him nonetheless. Because I HATE HIM. Got it?? Stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid... *bashes G's head against a wall* HAH!   I can't wait for summer. My parents are super-mad because, other than a few days of volunteering at DareARTS (who wants to join up?? I need at least 3 other people, so if you wanna, just say so, and I'll tell you when it is when I find out), I have nothing to do. Like, nothing. *g* Awesome, eh? We're going to Quebec or something for like 10 days, and I've got piano and harp lessons going on, but other than that, nada, zilch, rien. I am a happy camper, let me tell you. I simply cannot wait to let my brain languish. By September it'll be a steaming mass of swamp goo. Woo!   I can work on my story and my pictures and (if it's not too hot) walk outside wit da doog, maybe I'll even go to a movie if I ask some people.. ooh, and let's not forget the Anime thing in August... yippee! I had so much fun at the last one, and S claims that the August one is even better. So I can't wait! Plus, Britnix'll be there. Which will just be awesome, because she's cool.   I don't like libraries because everyone can look over your shoulder and see what you're doing. It is also insanely crowded here, and crowded places bug me, especially when everyone in the crowded place is old and tall. Old and tall people bug me too. It seems like they could step on me or go "Abracadabra!" and make me vanish. I don't like the idea that I am so easily made non-existent. Oh Weed Goddess, make me a Dandelion... *g* lol A!   About A. She ditched us in French! She felt 'sick' (yeah, right, A ^^;) and so she 'left.' I'll bet she is just carrying out her dandelion world peace plot. I wouldn't put it past her. That kid is slyyy... living with evil, sadistic grandparents must do that to ya. I know that if I lived with my grandparents I'd go crazy too. But probably, if I lived with any of you, I'd go crazy. I'm much too used to my own family. And I love them.   Do you guys think it's an instinctual thing for mothers to love their children? That, as soon as we.. popped out.. (bad mental picture), they were just overcome with love and willing to throw themselves off of cliffs to save us? I don't think so, but my mum swears it's true. She'd be the one to know, of course, but for some reason I think it's just  expected  mothers are like that. Not that it's actually the truth. Then again, I feel somewhat the same way about my dog (*blush*)... maybe I'll be like a super-mom and commit suicide for no reason at all other than to prove my love for my kids... Martyrdom! Woo!   But if my mum's right, and mothers really do just become automatically overwhelmed with love for their kids, then what about dads? Are dads like that, or are they just kinda along for the ride because of their attachments to their wife? Or maybe dads come to love their kids more over time. See, that's what I thought mothers would be like; they take care of the baby until the baby's old enough to talk and then they love each other because they love each other's personality. That almost seems like a better system. Why love someone who's disgustingly self-obsessed? Because some people's kids turn out that way. I would hate to have to love my kid just because they grew inside me. It's  A Woman's Choice , I tell you! *g*   It is now 3:50. I am bored out of my mind. I think I'll try to keep typing for this entire period, and then maybe I'll get an award for posting the longest post in Blogger history. I'll bet that award is already taken by A though. I'll beat her!! *growls* heeheehee!   So, what to write about...   OH! S's unrelenting insistance that I date N! No! He's old! He's grey-haired and wrinkly! Or not quite, and even then I wouldn't know because I've never actually met him in person, but still! He's graduating  this year , how weird and freaky is that?? He'll be going to university in like... a week! Not only that, if he did go to university, what would be the point in my going out with him ^^; AND, if he can't find someone his own age, I am wondering why I'd go out with him either.  Obviously  there's something wrong with the boy, if no girl his age will go near him... ^^;;;   It's 4:00 now. I'm browsing some art sites because I'm bored. Namely  urlLink DayDreamer  and  urlLink Nivbed's Artistic Extravaganza . I love them both. Nivbed's are kinda disturbing, and Julie's are kinda sweet. Very fantastical, impossible and dreamy. I love the Troika one by Nivbed, in his Finished Illustrations section. Go see!! Oh, and another good one (sexxxxy guys heehehehe!):  urlLink Jo Chen . Whew! You have never seen such sexy anime boys in your life, I swear. They wear leather and they have tattooes!! *stands back in awe*   4:07 by the comp clock, about 4:03 by the library clock. I'm going crazy. I have 30 minutes to blow!! ahh! I wish I had music here or something, except with the way I bash my bag around it'd probably be unsafe for my CD player. *sigh* I hate how we have to put our bags in our lockers. Damn fire hazard. I have 6 loopy things on my bag from broken key chains. This is getting ridiculous.   There is a white board on the wall in front of me, and it says Gill -Reid } Carson, Bolster -Gentile } McRory, and Sansone -Udovich } Leach. English? Must be. But why only 6 people in the class?   I love how they have all the movies on the wall. If I was sitting over there (but I'm not, since there's no computer on that side of the room), I wouldn't be writing in my blog. I'd be reading the blurbs on the movies! I love doing that. They have  12 Monkeys  here, know that? I love that movie! It's so crazy. They actually don't manage to save the world, which is the cool part. It's a bit like... wait. No. I won't ruin the ending for you. Just let it be said that my favourite character is named after a car ^^; And they compare the Earth to a sausage.   I would also like to apologize for leaving our team blog Hitchhikers. I was suddenly reminded of that blog, for no apparent reason... *wink wink nudge nudge* A is re-doing it for her and her English friends. But here is my excuse! I always post on this blog first (obviously), and so I'd have nothing to say on Hitchhikers... or I'd just repeat myself! If you really want to know what I think about life, just check here. Don't make me re-post everything because that's dumb and stupid.   I am mad that Calgary lost last night. Stupid refs. We shoulda won. We totally outplayed 'em.   BTW, if you're Joe Bob from Zimbabwe, I don't live in Calgary. But that's the Canadian team in the finals, so I'm cheering for them because they're cool. Long live the Maple Sugar!   I am sitting very contortedly in this library chair and people are giving me funny looks. I don't mind so much, since people usually do, but if the librarian asks me to stop pretending I'm in Cirque du Soleil I'll be mad. I like Cirque du Soleil, BTW. If I was strong and brave and flexible I might have even wanted to work in it.   It's 4:20 now on the comp. 4:15 on the library clock. These guys have got to get their story straight.   I want a nice sketchbook to doodle in, and make my own crazy dream-story like Charlatan Marmalade from teh nivbed. I like his art. It's very surreal. A should use it for a new blog template, it suits her ^^; I think she expresses herself better though writing, though. And music, too. A, do you like art?   So anyway. I am very bored. I think eventually the government is going to make it required to have a blog, so that they can keep track of all the crazy delinquents and follow the law and all that. I don't think the world will ever be perfect. I think everything is holy and has meaning to and of itself. I don't believe in any gods or goddesses or magic or anything like that. Or at least, if there is, it's not any more or less special than anything else. I think everything, in the end, is equal. I do believe there's such a thing as karma or whatever. I think I could totally teach the niners English. I also think that I'll never be able to speak perfect French no matter what, or perform (musically) completely nerve-free. I think everything everyone does is some form of art and should be treated as such. Or at least known as such, so if you're tired and cranky you're allowed to say "math is stupid and pointless and I wish it would die" as long as in the back of your head you know you're just being tired and cranky and you really don't with it would die.   Let's take a deep literary breath, k?   This chair I'm sitting on seems to be higher than usual, and because of that I feel very tall, even taller than this guy beside me who's probably in gr. 11 and is taller than most people; in fact, I think I'm a giant right now and if I stretched I could probably break through the ceiling and eat the sun -- it would probably burn a bit, but I'm sure it is juicy and sweet and after it had gone off my tongue it'd taste really good, probably like non-alcoholic alcohol or something, and maybe I could even reach past that and I would pick all my friends up and you could sit on my shoulders, and we would all sing starsongs and raise baby birds and angels as our pets, and live in a yellow submarine that floated and maybe all the Earth would drown and it would only be a puddle I could splash in.   You see how much height means to me?? ^^;   Ok, it is officially 4:25 on the library clock, so I am going to post this, gloat at the incredible length (it could have been longer if I hadn't been canoodling on nivbed and jdillon), and sign off. I love you but I love 4:30 more. Byee!
