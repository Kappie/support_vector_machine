(i kept thinking about all those stories about kids seizing because of the flashing lights in video games.)  there was no seizure, thankfully.  between the meds and the eye covering and the getting up and leaving the theater, things settled down.  i did feel confused and upset for a while, but that subsided, too.   the pre-seizure.  it's the strangest feeling, the most difficult-to-articulate feeling.  i tried to describe it to stean (my hero, who paid for our movie tickets and who left with me without the slightest complaint even though for once he was actually enjoying a movie i wanted to see), and i can think of only one thing that comes close, something from my younger, more foolish days, back when i thought i was invincible, a feeling that has been completely eradicated from my understanding of life in the past few weeks--it's like a bad drug experience.  everything feels immediate and crippling, as if you can feel yourself sliding away, but you're powerless to stop it.  it ain't fun.     we walked home.  i cried a lot.  the randomness of disease leaves me reeling.  i grew this thing--this tumor happened in me.  call it a mutation or a fluke or just plain bad luck, but its cells are derived from my cells.  how unfair...  my entire life i've been this nerdy smart kid.  gifted classes in grade school, skipped 5th grade because of high IQ, good at standardized tests, hell-bent college bound as a teenager, have toyed with the idea of joining mensa.  i feel as if my greatest attribute, the part of me of which i have always been most proud, is now betraying me.
