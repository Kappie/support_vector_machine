I mean, I know half of you are from earlier years/alternate realities, but that's really no excuse for not knowing how to speak in proper English!    Khala: What about me?    Sarah: *nods head* Okay, well, you  do  have an excuse, considering you're not really from Earth at all, but... I just kinda figured that most Tok'ra instinctively knew English. I guess if I really think about it, though, they (or y'all) weren't here for the Battle of Hastings in 1066, when English became greatly influenced by French for 1550, when English went though the great vowel change. It's a wonder all Tok'ra and Goa'uld don't speak Old English...       Vinnet: My host does not realize that all are not as interested in etymology as she.         Sarah: Well, I  technically, consciously  realize it, but convincing my inner self... *considers Vinnet* my  other  inner self, takes some doing.   Wow. That's surpisingly little for how much I've missed. Guess there wasn't much to comment on this time around. *glances around room*   Oh, I want you all to meet one of the newer Tok'ra, Khala. Why don't you introduce yourself?      Khala: *nods* I am a Fremen from Arrakis, also known as Dune. Do not try to travel there; our Stargate has been sealed. I am certainly a new host for the Tok'ra. *eyes flash*       Thellas: A word of caution concerning the antics presented here: my host has a short temper and an often-used knife. To anger her would not benefit your health.    *several gulps sound from around the room*   Sarah: But, you know, as long as we're all friends here, we shouldn't have any problems, right? *stares pointedly at Baka, Sparrow, and the K-people (Khala excluded)*
