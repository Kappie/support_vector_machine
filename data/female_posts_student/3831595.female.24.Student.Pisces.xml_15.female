I'm pressed for time, so lemme leave you with some observations:   With each passing day, I can't wait for graduation. I can't wait to have a job that I am somewhat interested in.  The wedding is a week from Saturday and we have a ton of stuff to do and no money to do it with.  ALF Season I is out on DVD now.  Want to make me happy? Well, hang on a little bit more and I will make it easier than ever for you. Keep watching.   Time for some old-fashioned TV.  Sleep well y'all.
