Last night I was sitting at the computer, going to random sites and trying to get "Smoke on the Water" By Deep Purple and...well, to no avail. Soo I went to bed before I took an axe to the computer. Then today, I went to the Telus Mobility website (my phone's brand...shocking, I know) and I poked my dad with a stick (metaphorically, of course) until he gave me his pin and client number so I could register to this site so I could get a ringtone. And, so I succeeded and registered a name to this site. And eventually I found the ringtone I wanted ("Smoke on the Water") and bought it. So, a couple minutes later I get a message on my phone. "You have a ringtone, 'Smoke on the Water'. Would you like to open it in Web Browser?" Or something to that effect. So I press OK and this white screen comes up with little blue arrows that look like >>>>>>>>> at the bottom of the screen. So I'm waiting for like, 10 minutes, then I quit because I'm impatient. Then I started again, at about 10:36, and it's still going, and its exactly 11:00 at this moment. I'm beginning to doubt that I even have Internet on my phone. I'll get my dad to attack the people at Telus tomorrow and find out. He was supposed to phone today but...he can't remember anything. Meh.  And today, (I'm still grounded for the whole door incident) I cleaned my ENTIRE house (by the demands/requests of my mother). Seriously. I did everything except the laundry. The only reason why I did it, essentially, was so I can have a bunch of people sleep over tomorrow, ON MY BIRTHDAY!!! (!!!) I can't wait. I'm real excited, and I don't know why. I don't even know what we'll do. XD. We'll probably go bowling. Ahah...Or something to that effect...Enter the 6 year old Friday night... :| Oh well. Its not like my parents'll be around.  And as far as school goes, nothing special happened. Had my gay morning classes then I had a smoke at lunch with Lindsay and people and then we sat in the cubby and I played with my phone and we ate lunch and do what we do every single day at lunch in the same cubby every day while we visit Him and discuss entirely random crap that I tell you about every single day I blog and I don't know why. Oh, but we have a new addition. A new addition to the cubby. Sort of. We don't know how much longer he will live, but he actually  does  exist. His name is Entertainor. Entertainor the Dancing Spider. He lives in the light above the cubby and skitters across, dancing for us at random intervals. I discovered Entertainor, and Lindsay named him. I was laying on Sandy's leg (She's  reaaally  comfortable) and I was staring at the light, and I saw this black dot in the middle of it. So I go, "Hey, look, a fly is stuck in the light. Haha." And it was creepy. Right when I said that the fly that wasn't really a fly at all got up and started skittering and dancing for us, saying, "Look! I'm not a fly! I'm better than a fly! Look! I'm dancing for you with my 8 gloriously magnificent legs!" and Lindsay's like, "Oh dude, that's a spider." "That's wildly entertaining. He's  dancing  for us!" "He can be Entertainor!" "Entertainor the Dancing Spider!" Thus concludes the story about Entertainor. Yeees, b'y. But. I must be going. It's late-ish and I need sleep. (By the way, my phone is still not loaded the webpage and its like, 11:15. Gaah!)   -Joebie
