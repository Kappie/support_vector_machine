Felt your skin and saw his eyes,  Whatever you do, don’t stop.  Knew my heart died and wished it was him,  Whatever you do, don’t let me fall.    Saw you breathing again, salt on your skin,  Whatever you do, don’t speak.  Felt you relax, wishing for love,  Whatever you do, don’t look at me.    Your eyes finally closed, dreaming of me,  Whatever you do, don’t ask me to stay.  Stand beneath the hot water, trying to make myself clean,  Whatever you do, just go away.      ~fin~
