I found.. lots of things... that've been lost... for years. First I found my lost birth certificate. Then I found the lost birth certificate I got to replace the first one because I needed it to get my passport. Then I found the passport I'd lost. My mom found my 16th birthday present, a traditional hawaiian gold ring with my name (in hawaiian) on it. That was pretty cool, as I've missed it for a long time. Since my 16th birthday, roughly.   I also found a bunch of old school note books. It's very interesting to read my highschool notes freshmen through junior year... they'll be notes down the first half of the page, and then all of the sudden they will stop mid sentence and have a poem or song down the rest of the page, and then maybe a list of things to do for a LAN party or angry thoughts about *insert anything stupid about highschool*. It's crazy to see what and who I was thinking about during those 3 years. I have about 30 songs now that I've pulled out and found as wadded up pieces of paper. Some of them just make me wince, other ones are actaully very good, which is odd because I thought they all sucked at the time.   but enough of that. I think its time for some   bike rider educaton   I went to a Mogwai concert last weekend. They were awesome. The trip there however was not. Nick got some directions off of mapquest, and in my opinion as far as mapquest is concerned im better off using my navigational intuition then following their horrible directions. Nick and I followed them precisely until we got to a 3 story bridge, the directions told us to take an exit on the top story of the bridge which was an impossibilty as our lane of traffic was on the bottom. So we took a few turns and ended up skiping about 7 steps of our mapquest "directions", found highway 26 ourselves and with Jen's cell phone guidance pinpointed the location of Aladin's Theater and parked.   Not before a "run in" with a bike rider though... and when I say "run in" I mean he ran into my car.  I was pulling out of a neighbor hood road back onto the main road, and as I  creeped  and  slowly   peeked  out to look  both  ways for traffic, I hear this thump on the side of my car (the bike running into my car). Then a few seconds later I hear more thumps (the bike rider kicking my car with his foot in anger). So he comes up to my window and starts yelling at me and such, and of course I felt horrible. That is, until I thought about it for awhile.  It was almost night time, there were no streetlights and as I got out of the car I realized this guy was wearing no reflective material, and had no lights of any kind on his bike. Right. So he was angry, and I wasn't exactly sure what had happened (I assumed it was my fault) and he kept saying "You didn't even look! You didn't even look for me!". Not that I would have seen him anyway, but he hit the back end of my car... which means my entire car had to have passed in front of his trajectory, and I was not moving very fast. Having the right of way doesn't mean you can be a moron. Whatever the situation, lets go back to the core-fundamentals of road survival.   car vs bike = car   this is because  car > bike . see how that makes sense? bigger beats smaller.  here's another example.   pedestrian vs semi = semi   this one should be easy for you.  pedestrian     so the semi wins.  here's a tough one...   car vs car   now in this senario you actaully have to apply other factors besides size (they are both the same) and use physics, another thing I've never learned. When you can master that problem you will have snatched the grasshopper out of my hand.   Nick. Despite what you said about running away if the guy punched me, I know deep inside myself that you would've stuck by me and kung-fu'd his azz.
