I sit on my rooftop looking at the stars and silently I pray God will wisk me away with the wind. I feel like shit I jsut recently found out I scared Shanna when we were together! I feel really bad for scaring her. Is ent her an e-mail telling her how I feel about steve!! That should go over well, so she will either tell me to fuck off or tell me it's none of my business either way I don't care as long as she doesn't leave me for me telling her how I feel about things. I am so proud of myself I haven't smoked in 4 days. I want to stop smoking because when Shanna and I have kids I don't want them to be around smoke like I was. I said when Shanna and I have kids after the e-mail I senther about steve I don't even know if she want to talk to me let alone be with me. I am so tired I cleaned the whole house today! I don't feel good I haven't felt good since the day befoer yesterday! I think I might breakdown and finally go to the doctor, but he is going to tell me I am fine besides be stressed. School will be starting soon I am excited about that. I am ready to make friends,and get to know the people around here!!! I bet I get some strange looks the first day all my rainbow stuff Shanna got me * Thank you Sweetheart* and all my piercings. I don't care thought they will either like me or not so I am notworried about it!! I am listening to Switchfoot *Thanks again for the cd sweetheart* I always listen to it when I am getting tired it makes me thank of my babygurl and I go to sleep happy!!! God I love her so much.I don't want to lose her!! I know in my heart she still loves steve otherwise she wouldn't let him treat her the way he does!! I hated the first time I talked to him and i tried to get along with him for her, but I hate him more now and I want to slap him upside the head for leaving my babygurl in a dark park by herself why he "watched" people smoke pot!! I hate the way he treats her and uses her and she jsut lets him get away it. It really pisses me off because I knwo if I treated half as bad as he does she wouldhave nothing to do with me, and when I say this to her she says "oh but he is my friend," some great friend he is leaving you in a dark park by yourself!!! I guess that is it because it's almost midnight and I need to do other things. I LOVE YOU SHANNA I REALLY DO LOVE YOU
