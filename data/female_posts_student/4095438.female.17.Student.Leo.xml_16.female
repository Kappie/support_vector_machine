Nikolaos Siranidis and Thomas Bimis won the mens synchro 3m springboard after both the Chinese and Russian teams suffered from freak mistakes. The Chinese, heavy favourites and cemented in 1st place after 4 out of 5 rounds, missed their last dive and failed to score a single point after one of its members lost control and smacked into the water neck first. The Russians almost missed their last dive when one of their divers' legs hit the springboard on the way down, putting a huge dent in the score for their final dive.   The manner in which the Greeks snuck in to 1st place after more talented teams fell down (metaphorically speaking) is reminiscent of  urlLink Steven Bradbury's victory  in Salt Lake City 2 years ago. It is Greece's first ever diving gold medal and their first gold medal of the 2004 Games.  Also of interest is that the Greek pair qualified for the event solely on merit, instead of by the automatic host nation qualification.  In an enthralling hour of TV, the diving event also saw the security measures made into a mockery after a streaker/intruder wearing some sort of tutu stormed the area and jumped into the pool as a team was getting ready to dive. Yup, 10 points to those security guys - top job, blokes.
