It was good and everything, I just don't feel anything with him like I wish I felt. I guess I just have in my head the kind of person that I want to fall in love with....and I don't want to be occupied with this guy if the right guy comes along. Or maybe I'm just a fucking idiot.  Who knows?  I wish I was 18, this is something I would like to smoke over...I just don't want to get caught. lol. I'm such a pussy. *sigh* whatever.  I'm out...hope Ben replies with a mutual want for coffee shop time. I need caffeine dreams so I can cool down.  Oh! and I went over to ben's yesterday for his "party" (which was lame...as always) But he looked soooooooooooo cute. God damn him. God damn him and his stupid shirt. Oh well, I'm gonna pretend it didn't faze (is that right?) me and go on with life.  I base too many of my feelings on boys.  I fucking hate boys.
