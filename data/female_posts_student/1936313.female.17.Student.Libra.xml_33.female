I'm trying to not let myself get dragged under... Michael wouldn't have liked that... and Marks coming up so I have someone near if I need him... (Dad I think feels a lil replaced all of a sudden but meh.)  I've been in quite a good mood lately.. and todays just been fantastic. Have my conditional acceptance into GMC, which is great so long as I pass Math now. Have to unregister myself from MHC. I got my creative writing portfolio back today.. so hooray for 100%!!! (that beats out my 97% the last time i did the class) I can at least boast that much.. even if this year the class doesn't count since I took it once before.  Came home and checked on my Writing.com account. I've suddenly become liked -lol- I've got good ratings on both pieces I've got on there and an offer to help me edit it down a bit. 3 times already today I've been told my story can be published. Has the world gone nuts?!  Been listening to old tapes I went and found, hehe, which is of course oh so fun. Really old stuff like Matthew Sweet and Letters to Cleo. Ah well, all fun.  I love the summertime... its so much easier to be upbeat when your not freezing your butt off and the sun is shining. (So long as it's not too hot.. it's been nice lately)..  Wagner grad on Monday! and Megs 18th!!! Happy 18th Meggies!!!... ooh.. haha.. and its Election Day... VOTE WELL CANADA!... since I can't yet.. -scowls-    - -The rivers running low where it used to overflow.. I imagine something more.. will I live without you at all?... All my memories blend and bleed... empty arms reach out... weak with need... and I fall.. yet I'm cold and tired of change to hold on. Hold on. Hold on.- -
