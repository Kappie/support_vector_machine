What I have to say is this, if you know about Singapore Idol, you must have heard and watched America Idol; you must have know what exactly are judges anticipating; and what will make you qualify as a Singapore Idol.  Somehow, some went for the audition and became Singapore Idiots! Real Idiots!  If these idiots actually make a quick or brief glance through the nowadays idols, and get the definition of what an idol meant, then scram!!! We don’t need idols that can hula-hoop and sing at the same time! We don’t need singers that strip and sing at the same time! I have had enough of that irritating William Hung for the noise pollution he caused when my radio suddenly blasted his “she bangs” while studying…  Worst still, a lemon tree guy actually wanted to be Singapore’s version of William Hung?! Oh Please!!! Why are you so useless?? Why not have a bigger ambition rather than being a nuisance?! I’m just sick and tired of all these “potential wannabe William Hung”!!! See that wall in front of you? Well, don’t bang it! Bang all the walls you can find in your house except the one in front of you. Hopefully, it makes you wake up and face the reality!  Oh, by the way, this other TV program I watched yesterday… “ The Singapore Brainiest Kid ”! Oh my! I think the producers should have titled that “Brainiest Kid” the “Most arrogant cum haughty cum O.P. kid”!!! Fancy looking at her competitor with that you-will-lose-to-me-one-lah look, giving that who-cares snare, and that last word “I’m so sorry” when the host announced her as Singapore’s Brainiest Kid. Wow! It’s like, I’m so sorry, I’m cleverer than you. You know, I don’t mean to be cleverer than you… I just happen to be more intelligent! Oh I’m so sorry! I won the title… I meant to let you have it you know… but I’m force to be entitled the title, because it just happen that I am more brainy than you…. I’m so SORRY!!!  Eat shit la!  And one look at her attire, a black long plaited shirt, which looks like one in some granny’s closet, and a pink blouse, like those kind of working adult type! Yucks! What an insult to the colour “pink”, having you destroy the beauty of pink! Yeeks!!!!  Not to forget, she actually snatched that trophy from the winner last year. Yeah, snatched! No kidding! Oh no… is that the kind of what Singaporeans we are producing… I’m fainting!!!  Just don’t ever let me see her again…
