I know what your saying! Why am I up so damn late typing like a jackass or an ASS WITH EARS!? Well I'll tell you, I decided to make a site where I can put all my ideas and other shit on here just for shits and giggles. I think I'll start with a story, and it goes like this.        Once upon a time there was a nasty disgruntled man and he lived in a disgusting shit house that was in the shape of the genitals of a gnome, and he lived with several "Camwhores". And he loved to make everybody's life miserable, until one day a really really big meteor crushed his house! Unfortunately he escaped unharmed. As he brushed himself off he turned his head and to his surprise he found himself surrounded by rabid wolves, he ran as fast as he could through the forest, but the wolves finally got him and tore him up real good. But the nasty man broke lose and began to tear through the open meadow, in a real frightful state of stampeding he tripped on a pebble and landed flat on his ugly face. As he arose he was face to face with a really big grizzly bear the bleeding poor slob screamed like a cat that had a 600 pound lady sit on it and the bear picked him up and threw him and he went flying like a vegetable out of the mouth of a burger king happy customer! And as he was falling to his certain death he actually felt sorry for being so nasty and started to repent even! And an Angel appeared and she stopped time so they could "chat"  The Angel was like " Give me one good reason why I should save your ass? The damage is already done, and it cannot be reversed. So you better make this short and sweet." the man was completely taken aback from how the angel was handling things but he tried his luck even though he felt really insecure about the situation " Dear sweet messenger of God, I beg of you to please help me out of this bind! I know I was a non believer before but I am a believer now.." He replied. The Angel thought for a minute " Well since I am an Angel and I'm supposed to do good..." The Angel paused " Yes? And??" muttered the man after dying from anticipation " YE ARE TO BE DOMED TO THY FIERY PITS OF HELL!" exclaimed the furious God. So the man went falling to his death landing on sharp rocks below, and the world was a better place and there were no such things as camhoes anymore.  The Moral of the story: Mean People suck, every nasty person in the world who does people so wrong will get there's in the end. And that's why my faith is soo strong and always will be.  I know for a fact that all mean nasty people have really fucked up lives and that's why they try to make other people's lives miserable, so they can feel better about themselves, the thing is some people, like me, have the knowledge to know what's really going on.
