Nope...I just that damn in shape!  So woke up to my father walking into my room asking me the dumbest question..."do you know anyone in a white car, cause they've been parked outside our house for 10 minutes?" uh...I dont care!? If they arent getting out, and arent harming (or planning on harming) anyone...then I could give a shit. So, to please the father, I looked out the window facing the front of my house, and sure enough...the car had left! Because I got my ass out of my comfy, warm bed, to see something that might have been important...and it leaves! Of course! Ahh oh well, so i figured it was 11:15, I might as well just stay up, cause I didnt want to wake up later than 1...I had to work!   Work. Wow, I think i have made my statement clear in the posts on the days I have worked...I can't stand it! I got ready for work, and got lunch, and headed over to the hospital, to work with the new girl, Jessie. She was actually really fun to work with today...and we forgot to do magazines...whoops! Oh well I'm gone in 19 days, they cant fire me! haha, stupid old ladies! So the entire shift, I was reading magazines, and talking to Jessie, and talking on my phone to Caleb...who actually called me first! Surprising after our fight we had last night, i thought he wouldnt want to come swimming at Gin's tonight, but he was like...what time you coming over there?  uhhh..after work..duh?!  so I told him around 8:30, and i would meet him there.  Nip/Tuck night, of course, meant partying in the pool, and not watching our event title. I brought my   Blue Bikini   to work to change into, so i could run through the house, and hop right into the pool...it worked! Kevin Gamms was back from North Carolina, and he was there chillin' with NB and Ryan Andrews. It was fun seeing them run around in soaked boxers! wink! hahahaWe stayed in the pool until we got hungry...made a wendy's run, and hopped back into the pool! I swallowed soo much water, it was ridiculous...I always get dunked by Kraus and Cal...It's inevitable! They were asses tonight...ahh i give up, I can't be nice to everyone anymore...they will forever be assholes in my mind. Oh well, I'm happy that I will be and hour and a half from both of them next year! ahh..that'll be nice! So I left when the boys: aka...Kraus, Cal, Kevin, and Steve, decided that they were gonna go pool hopping...naked! Uhh..w/e So we watched as they practiced their cannonballs, then they got naked, and ran to the car! It was a sight to see, wasn't a bad sight, but they're assholes so I wasn't attracted. If Kraus, and Cal were not to speak and just stood there, covering their parts, they would be attractive to me...but...they open their mouths and it all goes away! which is unfortunate I guess. So, they were off to be assholes to random people...as they terrorized their pools with their weapons of mass destruction: Cannonballs!   Ah..now im just sitting at home on the 'puter, as I complain about my chlorified eyes, and dry skin. And my dehydration taking control of me...wave motions. It seems as though I'm in the wave pool at Noah's Ark..nope! I think thats what i get for being in a pool for 3 hours!haha
