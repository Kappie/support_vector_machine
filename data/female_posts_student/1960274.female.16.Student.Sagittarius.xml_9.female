It was definately the trip of a lifetime. I'll probably blog more about it later, but I have so many memories, deeper friendships, learned many lessons, it was a great experience. The first week we ran a VBS. I had no idea what we were in for. It was a really difficult, tiring week, but boy was it worth it. The living situations these kids come from is really sad. I've never broken up so many fights in a week. Thursday was especially bad. We had 2 huge fights. Some of the kids were so cold. But just when we were beginning to feel discouraged, God chose to bless our efforts and 7 kids came to know Christ that night. I think we had 14 or 15 in total accept Christ during VBS. Pastor Woodall one night asked us the question "Why these kids? Why here? Why us?" I thought about it for a long time. Why did God choose to have us run a VBS for some of the most horribly behaved kids? Why did God want us to spend the majority of the time at VBS disciplining them? Then Thursday, the worst day, it hit me. These kids needed to be reached out to. These kids needed to hear the message of salvation. They needed attention. If God had given us 50 little angels like we might have wanted, those 15 kids would not be going to Heaven now. Although at the time dealing with 100 kids who started fights for everything seemed tiring, dissapointing, and hard, it was the best thing. God really does know what He's doing. I have so much more faith in Him just from that little experience. It was a hard week, but I would do it again in a heart beat. Then we got to know some of the adults and teens during the youth conference the next week. It's hard not being with them now. It's so reassuring, knowing that I'll see some of them someday in Heaven. Overall the trip was wonderful. There will now be 27 more souls in Heaven someday, we all learned many lessons, I feel much closer to God, and I developed some friendships that will last for an eternity. One of the biggest encouragements on the trip was my team. When something wasn't going my way, or I wasn't being very flexible in an area, they would calmly tell me that we could all have to be stretched in many ways during this and that they were praying for me. They encouraged me to keep going and not give up. To my Bahamas sisters~ You were all great! So many memories and great times shared. The curse (yeah ang! you beat it!), rearranging the showers, bleacher talk, breaking showers (that was the best thing that happened), Miss Syr's jokes...I could go on and on of the many great memories. I love you all to death! Thanks for making the trip even better than it already was. To my Bahamas brothers~ There's one word that describes you all: FUNNY! I laughed so hard at you guys. Luke digging for buried treasure, Will's noises, Robbie scaring Amanda in the sand, so many funny times. You guys were all awesome and I'm glad we all go t to go together. All in all, it was the best trip I've ever taken. I miss the Bahamian people so much and I want to go back. Maybe someday...  And he won a free book off the radio.
