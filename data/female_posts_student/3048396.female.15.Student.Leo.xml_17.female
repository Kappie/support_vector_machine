Oh well...anyways Spanish we took a quiz and translated stories...There were some pretty interesting ones...like one about Bill Clinton, french fries and Bigbird. Fun stuff...I also probably failed a Science test today. I can't remember formulas. Oh well. It shouldnt hurt my grade to much. Hmm...then nothing interesting happened...until band. Like I said I forgot my horn so I used Kali's trombone and Karls mouth piece. Yuck. LoL oh well I barely played anyways...So yeah Mr Musel was going on about large group contest...and he said the first weekend in May. I fliped. First weekend in May is the very last YC Meeting for this year. So I was extreamly pissed for along time...until supper when I looked on the schedual and it said....May 8th *sigh* Thank God!  Otherwise today has been Great! Had a wonderful I mean  wonderful  talk with Kaitlyn. :D Im soo happy. We have this wonderful plan...that hopefully will work out...It shall be interesting...So yeah...I guess thats all for now...Must go suck up to my parents...lol...  later, -Tara
