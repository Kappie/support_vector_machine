But she did get a few things sold though...so i guess it wasn't a complete waste of time. Yep sorry i haven't updated sooner...got my wisdom teeth out...and Tyler was my nurse...aww it was so very nice of him to take care of me...hehe......but its ok now...i can kinda eat ...but i have to think about chewing...so i don't bite the inside of my mouth...hmm alittle too much infomation i guess...neways. I started reading "Our Town" today too...not that bad of a book. Well its getting kinda late and gotta go to church tomorrow so i guess i will go to bed soon...ill try to update sometime soon next time. :D
