I jus got back from my funk class w/ my mom (nice to see u there jordan - note the sarcasm), and that was, hands down, THE most fun I've had working out.  Miranda, Marcela and I will probably have  Step in the name of love  in our heads tomorrow (that was the cooldown song).  It was a great calf workout; I'm really glad it didn't focus on abs, cuz they're STILL sore from my Pilates on the Ball class from yesterday.  My benefits have paid off though - I'm swimming a fraction faster, and I feel a bit better.  Wonder if it can curb my weird dreams, like the one i had in chemistry on Friday, and the one i had last night. I met the person who might take Gill's place next year - well, one of the applicants.  She was a bit short, quiet, friendly...that works.  Mrs. Gates and I showed her the journalism room, the news room, answered some basic questions, all that jazz.  I probably should have given her a yearbook, and outlined all the editors on staff.  Wow, I really am weird. I really need to go study for my math analysis quiz.  Either way though, I get a really, really low grade on interim.  I'll leave you with this: Why do people lie?  I usually lie to people I like more than people I'm friendly with, and I lie almost constantly to people I dislike.  Why is that.  While you ponder one of my deep questions, I'll ponder why I cannot understand trigonometry as a whole.  So weird.  Later
