I was talking fairly loudly and said "whenI was drunk" at least twice. About 5 mins later I realized that my mom was still about 10 feet away, and had been the whole time. Ooops.... oh well, she never said anything, and if she doesn't know about everything by now then she's just stupid. I've slipped up way to much lately. Like the other day she told me I should drink some more of my blue uv, so we were at hte store and they didn't have lemonade, and I almost said 'that's ok, you can mix it w/ sprite and orange juice and it tastes fine' Yay, go me, I almost opened my big mouth on that one... Oh well, I can't help being stupid.  So basically, there's no way in hell my parents don't have at least SOME idea of what I do. And as far as I'm concerned that's fine as long as they don't keep me from going places.
