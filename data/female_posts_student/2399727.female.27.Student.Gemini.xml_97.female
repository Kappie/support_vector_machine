Overheard a couple of older ladies commenting on the way out, "They need to tell us about these things!  I couldn't figure out why he was wearing that funny hat!"  True, I'd never seen a purple mitre either...  March came in like a lamb in Southern Ontario.  I am going to hate seeing it go out like a lion.  Contemplative, grumpy, scared, lost, curious, unsettled...  More to come...
