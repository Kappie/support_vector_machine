For the purposes of this post, I'm going to define this topic as encompassing these questions:   Conceptual Questions  1. How can love, sex or friendship be defined? 2. What forms of each can be distinguished? 3. How are they related to each other?   Empirical Questions  4. What are the phenomenological manefestations of love, sex or friendship? 5. How has people's understanding of these phenomena fluctuated throughout history? 6. How does biological sex and socially conditioned gender affect our experience of sex, love and friendship?   Ethical Issues  7. What are our moral obligations in intimate relationships? 8. How can we responsibly balance freedom and intimacy? 9. What kinds of relationships are most healthy and fulfilling? 10. What social changes are desirable if love and friendship are to flourish? 11. Are we morally required to combine sex with love or is sex without love also acceptable? 12. What is the best attitude to take towards marriage? 13. Under what conditions, if at all, is adultery permissable? 14. How should we approach romantic beginnings? 15. What does true equality between lovers require?  These questions come from a handout I received in Philosophy 2210: Contemporary Moral Issues, at Langara College, taught by Dr. Kurt Preinsperg.  He's a fabulous instructor, and I'm really quite upset that the semester is just ending.  How can I possibly cover these issues in the space of two days?  I can't, which is why I'm starting this here.  I'll be posting answers to these questions slowly over the next little while.  In the meantime, however, feel free to make some of your own observations, or ask your own questions.  I would also appreciate any links to good philosophy blogs, or any information about books that are applicable to this or any other of my future topics.  Thanks for reading! :)
