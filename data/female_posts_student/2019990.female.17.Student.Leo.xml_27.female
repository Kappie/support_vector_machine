So I feel like hitting her.  And you know it's not like I have finals I should study for next week, or other homework, or my own life.  For the next two weeks the world revolves around Wonder Woman.  And she's being a little whiny brat lately.  We went to Great Spoons yesterday, and we were supposed to return some napkins my mom didn't want at target, and get some digital pictures ordered.  Well Wonder Woman didn't feel like doing it, and so I have to do that today in my two hours I have to get a bajillion things done.  Then she asks me to pick up a guest book for her too.  I figured since I was doing so much for her, it wouldn't be unreasonable to ask her to get me some gas right?  (she doesn't even have to pay for it, my parents pay for it ) Apparently I was wrong, she's too self ritous to do something for the lowley stressed out juniors of the house.  Then she tells me how I wouldn't be so stressed out if I didn't talk to my friends on MSN all the time, and it's somewhat true, but you know they're al moving away in about three months, so I think I have the right to talk to them now.  And for the past month probably while I've been on MSN I've been working on essays and other homework as well.  You'd think she would understand, seeing as the same thing happened to her last year.  Apparently empathy has no longer term memory.  Well I'm off to get gas.  wish me luck.
