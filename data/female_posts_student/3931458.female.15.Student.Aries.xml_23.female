Actually I dont know why I was so tired because for most of the day i didnt do anything except for watching TV and messing around on the computer! But I helped my mom get ready for her crop( which miree was having too much fun with other people to come) and I was supposed to go with my dad to his work but since i thought kayla was spending the weekend with me I decided that I was gonna stay home, well kayla's parents decided not to go to normangy for the weekend so kayla wasnt isnt staying with me this weekend so i was gonna tag along with Vanessa,Austin, and Miree when they went shopping, but they didnt wake me up! So i was left at home! but when Austin did get home we invited andy and Kristi to come over cuz they wanted to hang out and we all got the pool/clubhouse ready for game day! It was pretty fun Kristi spent the night. I havent seen her in ages!
