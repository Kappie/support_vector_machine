Then finnaly when I decide I need to go get something so disapears and reappears in the most obscure place in the store...usually somewhere she has already been after I spend 5 minutes seacrching up and down every isle, which I have become too good at...By that time shear and complete bordom sets in and i wander mindlessly, after getting thouroughly pissed about why she just ditches me. finnaly after going up and down every isle 5 times and hearing, endlessly " What do you want? What do we need? Is this  okay?" we finnaly get to the salvation of the cash regester where scarey old men bear perolusly down on me as I unload the cart and read the tabloids. But the upside is that I did lear that they can make everthing possible low carb and that I would by bad food just because there is a bunny on the package...So I finnaly out of the vile grocery store and now must rant about something that isn't so mindless.  Today would be the birthday of my little brother. fun. He has his friends here who stair at me when I am on the phone, eating or on the computer. But I have a bit of salvation from them as they are currently mini golfing. I do realise though that they all seem so much more normal and slightly less annnoying then my own brother. And after realising that the really quiet one that was sitting across from me was the kid that I start babysitting on Monday made me fell really good. The little children seem to like me so no revolutions or anything. But Paul got grounded and couldn't come save me...so i really have been bored out of my mind. No one on the computer, no one here to tak to, no one to call...That's just great... But...rachel did meet Paul over the phone today. It was very interesting...at least for me...and all seemed to go well. yeah...for it being so boring i seem to have a lot to talk about. That's good. Umm...yeah gonna go watch VH1 and finish my quilt while pondering how to get my self to stop being so fricking bored. ...
