It's like, IMPORTANT. It's stressing me out more than a Lit essay. If I fail this one, I will be screwed. And so will a lot of other people.....  Right now, I am trying to make sense of all the information i've deemed helpful. (ABout 11.25 pages' worth on Word, buddy. Many spaces and varied fonts, but still a LOT....)   Big T, as he shall henceforth be known, has known about Jules' "problem"for a lot longer. I don't know how he found out, but I know it wasn't be seeing them like Angela and I did.  (God, these fake names are killing me.)  So after much discussion, hair-pulling-outing, whining, crying, and thinking, we're going to have an intervention. It's been going on longer than we realized and none of us can work alone.   I know there will be at least ten friends who will come if we ask, maybe more. We may be able to get the band directors, assuming they aren't required to tell the school. Unfortunately, Jules' parents are somewhat wacko. They're very controlling and sometimes actually just a teeny bit verbally abusive - it's always, "Get your butt over here and answer the phone!" or something.  Angela also noticed that the way Jules talks to her younger brothers, who are in elemntary school, is probably influenced by her parents. I wondered why she was mean about stuff, but that's just how you learn to deal, I guess. I mean, I use humor, which came from my Elterns, so take from it what you will.  Anyway, her parents are of the keeping-children-inside-the-home-will-make-them-good school of thought, and were we to tell them, we all fear that they would do something stupid like ground her and make her promise to stop.   Even my MOTHER thought of this.  So.... I've been to all these wizeb sizites, which is exhausting. I'm hoping against hope that cutting is her only problem, so that her parents don't have a chance to muddle things up and alienate themselves from her even more than they already have.   However, she has post-traumatic stress disorder which gives her migraines, diabetes, and an ebbing relationship with a rather stupid boy that I am not a big fan of right now.  I dunno... Don't worry about me, no need to pity-fy, but maybe if you're one of those "God" types, you could put in a good word.... I think I just need to put my thoughts out there, and I didn't want anyone to think I was just going to "forget" about it. We've got two weeks full of schedule-type activities, but soon, my dears, soon we will confront her, and I have a feeling that this will be the hardest thing I've ever done. Harder than AP Language, harder than weight training, harder than learning music.  Damn, this will be hard.... I'm very glad I've got two of my best friends to help me through the planning. And Jules is very much worth it.  I don't need anythingsurmised about an intervention right now, please. Contrary to popular belief, I do have common sense... but if anyone out there has ever staged one, maybe leave me some tips that you can't find on "support dot org" type places?
