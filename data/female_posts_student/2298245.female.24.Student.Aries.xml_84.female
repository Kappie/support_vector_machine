I braved the snow to come all the way out here to school, only to discover that the internet was down.  So I bravely treked back home.  Just one more word about the snow, before I let it go, because it is a sunny and beautiful, albeit slightly cold, day here today:  I think snow is evil, sent by the Devil himself, to lure hapless sinners into thinking that the heat and damnation of Hell might not be so bad after all.  Then, there was the other big crisis of the weekend.  I nearly lost a very important file, i.e. the much talked about tax outline.  Yes, I know I should back up my files, and normally I do, but I've been very busy and have neglected this duty.  And so I flew into a panic.  But all is well now.  My father calmed me down over the phone, and gave me some very helpful suggestions.  It turned out that the file was not corrupted after all, I was just having trouble opening it with Word on MY computer, but it opened elsewhere fine.  I copied and repasted it into a new document, dubbing it "New Tax Outline" and the world as I know it was saved.  The moral of this story:  there is a God, and he is merciful at times, even to an ungrateful sinner like myself.   I have a final today, so things might be a little slow going here on the blog.  I will try and post things if I can, but otherwise, I will be cramming little bits of information into my brain as best I can before 6:30 tonight.
