I found out wonderful things that brought my ego sky high, and things that made it plummet beneath the earth.   Well, for the good news. Dan had asked me what was up with Tim and I. I told him nothing more then had been in the past. He then decided to go and tell me that i'm the perfect girl. I couldn't believe those words came out of his mouth. This sounds so egotistical but i had to know exactly why he found me the visible and mental personification of perfect. He said four things: I'm pretty, I like video games, I'm easy going, and that I don't put up with drama. And apparently to Dan, those are the ingrediants for the perfect girl. This is where it got the best. He told me that Kellan and him had been talking and had decided that if kellan wasn't so short and that if Dan wasn't dateing Steffanie they'd both be going after me. I haven't felt that giddy and light hearted in...god, forever. Its that feeling when you were in middle school and you idolized this boy from afar and thought he didn't even know you existed, and then one day you caught his eye from across the room and he smiles at you. But of cource this news is bitter sweet due to the fact that dan WON'T be breaking up with Steffanie...ever...they've been going out for 5 years now. And I, well, don't have enough power of suduction to bring him to me. So it's nice to know he wants me, but, thats about all the pleasure i can get out of that.  And, of cource, during our conversation nate had to come into play. I haven't talked to him in a good month or so. Here's the news that made my heart sink like a rock.  He's dateing a girl at Drop Em Dead...alright...i guess i can handle that...i mean she's probably prettier then me and all....NO. NO not at freaking all. Dan likened her to his girlfriend, who isn't the skinnest person in the whole world, and he said that she's FATTER then stef is. God...and on top of that she's older then nate and has a strong tendency to drink alot.   hmm. There goes my self esteem again. Whatever little bit i gained earlier in the conversation went out the window. Am i that horrible? God...why would he choose her over me...  I'm done. I've had enough. I am numb to emotions dealing with boys. I will never fall in love again.  ...  Jesus.
