Hope you have a nice day with families, friends, and lots of people you don't even know (if you go see fireworks, that is)... :-)  After church we're all going over to my cousin Kim's house in Pipe Creek.  Woohoo!  Alcohol and fire... what more could a gal ask fer?  I'm sure that the works of fire will be a purty as anything I've eva seen!  :-)  More later...
