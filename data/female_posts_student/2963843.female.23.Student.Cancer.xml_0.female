To remind that life is magical, and full of pleasant surprises.  At that very same moment, it brought both of us near. Even while I'm on a train, and you on your path home. We were so close, never really leaving each other.  Why did you look up? why did I look down?  I cannot find an explanation for this. I do not intend to. I just need to feel. Let life work its own magic. =)
