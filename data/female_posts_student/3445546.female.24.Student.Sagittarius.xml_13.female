(kinda rhymes, which amuses me right now...but that might be the four hours of sleep i got.)  anyhow, i am thrilled.  it was a tough semester, with some hard classes.  i mean seriously, who really understands the federal rules of evidence?  who even cares to understand them?  certainly not myself, but i even got a good grade in that class as well.  but i actually studied this year and even overcame the ex of over six years dropping a bomb on me a wee two hours prior to one of the big exams, pulling in my second best grade in that class.  his news having such a small impact, if not perhaps no impact at all, somehow gives me the belief that i really am done with that chapter of my life, which is bittersweet, but right now, more sweet than bitter.  so, i am happy about this.  so happy in fact that i am going to treat myself to a soy chai.  yeah, but only after i go run in the rain.  i love running in the rain, primarily because i feel totally free to splash in the puddles and secondly because sometimes there are ducks out and i heart ducks.  quick flashback for you all...back in undergrad i studied abroad to england, scotland, ireland and france.  i believe somewhere in england our gang had gone on a tour of a very old castle in the pouring down english rain.  i was super excited though, because i kept seeing all of these amazing ducks all over the estate.  finally, after much meandering (because one meanders when in england) i stumbled upon a duckery!  (somewhat like a nunnery, but minus the nuns and plus ducks...or yeah, it was really a duck pond with a sign that said duckery.)  anyhow, i was SO happy about this.  it was absolutely necessary in my mind to get a picture of myself in front of the duckery...regardless of the pouring down rain.  so, i get positioned and am waiting for someone in the group to take to photo, but all of being hungover, things are moving slowly and in that hungover state, i lose my balance (actually, i am not real coordinated, i fall even not hung over) and tumble ever so gracefully into the damn duckery.  which was full of ducks.  and dirty ducky water.  it was like one giant mud puddle with tons of ducks.  needless to say, it was a very funny moment and a great picture.  and you know, i still love ducks...according to gabe, i even walk somewhat similar to a duck...which i am taking as a compliment, even though that is a questionable inference.  but hey, it's my damn blog and i can draw all sorts of inferences.    alright, back to the joys of living in a newly constructed home, which is certainly incredibly beautiful, but sometimes frustrating.  specific to this instance there were no peeking half toothed builders or random workers waking me up, but instead a broken hot water heater...so, cold showers for me.  now, i know cold showers can serve an important function, but really, i'm not in the frame of mind or physical desperation where i need to utilize such a freezing shower, but whatever, i'll roll with it, given i have absolutely NO ability to fix it given my total lack of mechanical skills.  word on the street (or around the house) is that a new one will be installed later today, amazingly when i am at work, so i won't actually have to deal with anyone fixing things for a day.  such a treat.  alright, enough from me.  i finished work last night at 1 am and am now getting ready to go back in...the whole late night shift back to back with the lunch shift kinda blows, but whatever, i need some frelling (thank you caleb) money.
