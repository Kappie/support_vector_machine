I just have to keep repeating "law school, law school, law school" over and over in my head to remind myself that this will all be over soon.  Well, he called yesterday. Probably in response to the two e-mails and the message I left on his answering machine, but yeah, well, I never doubted that he'd call me BACK, but I wanted him to take the initiative and call first. I should remind him that it was his idea that we be "friends" after we broke up, not mine! The conversation was nothing to write home about, since I had just gone to sleep (granted, it was early, but I was tired) and he was acting like he felt like he was waking me up from this Snow White-esque sleep or something. He said he'd call me later, but ask me how much stock I put into that? Not much, don't worry. I'd like to see him this weekend, but what is the point of pushing it? If he wants to, he will, right? But that doesn't dismiss the fact that I miss his stupid ass.  But I think I have other things to keep me occupied this weekend. One of my sorority sisters is coming here from San Jose and another one is coming from Ohio. It should be a pretty busy weekend, I'm guessing, although I don't know what the hell the plans are, because I think they're all being made through one of my sorority sisters who lives in Van Nuys (25 miles from me). I miss my sister (sorority sister, don't forget) from San Jose. She was one of my best friends in college. So I'm excited to see her again. I haven't seen her since graduation weekend.  So, my friend R from home got into Teach for America. Whoopee for her. I'm actually really excited for her, but I'm a bit turned off by her lately. When I went home to Ohio, she was just out of control degrading and rude to me. So now, she is supposedly "falling in love," and now that she got into Teach for America in North Carolina, she's having all these crazy thoughts about "having the talk" with her current boyfriend (of two months...gimme a break! There's no talk to be had yet, but of course, will she listen to me? No! My advice is worth jack diddly to her, why does she bother asking me shit?) and maybe asking him to move down there with her. Those are similar to the circumstances for which she degraded me...I mean, f**k that shit! What a hypocrite! I'm really just sick of being her little pawn in life, and when I advise her (unselfishly, mind you, since she has a terrific way of wanting what's best for her in her advice to me) of what's best for her situation, she completely disregards it. But if I don't take her advice, I'm degraded, laughed at, pissed on with her snide comments...why the hell do I maintain this friendship? After my most recent trip home, I have to keep asking and asking myself that question. I almost wrote her a letter telling her that I needed a break from all of this bullshit, but I didn't...but I can't be sweet, mute little pawn me with her anymore.  Whew. Weekend is here, thank you thank you. I hope it turns out to be a good one, but most weekends for me having been finding themselves in the lame department. I'm going to chat in the Dave Matthews newsgroup chat now...until the next crisis...
