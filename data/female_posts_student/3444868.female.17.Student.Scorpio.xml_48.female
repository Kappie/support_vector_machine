They leave today, so they're already packed and stuff.  I took a shower this morning and went to find a hairdryer.  Now you all should know we have two hairdryers in this house because only three people use them.  Two of the people are going on the trip, which leaves one of them (me) at home.  Can someone please tell me why they have to take two hairdryers on their trip? Especially when a ton of other girls will be in the cabin and will probably be nice enough to share theirs if need be.  I mean I use one styling product thing and it's the hairdyer.  This may seem trivial but to me this is a big deal.  I mean what if my dad and I want to go somewhere nice while they're gone.  Will I be able to dry my hair? No.  And the rest of the family is going to rebuild houses, and they won't be going anywhere nice.  Is this God's way of punishing me for not going on this trip? I didn't think so.  Well other than that I've had a every uneventful week.  I'd tell you what I did, but I don't remember.  I do remember that I had my senior pictures taken.  Ah the joys of being a senior.  Emily and my mom better be glad senior pictures aren't this week coming up because if so I wouldn't have a hairdryer.  I don't consider that the biggest deal in the world, but my mom would because "it's my senior year." I also skipped a theatre thing this morning because none of my friends were going.  Hanging out with middle schoolers from 8-12 in the morning isn't exactly my idea of fun.  That's all for now.  When I remember what else I did this week I'll fill you in because I know you're dying to know.  Go ahead and laugh.  I would.
