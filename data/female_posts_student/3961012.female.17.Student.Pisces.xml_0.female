That explains why i have been suffering from this huge outbreak of   ZITS  .     Wednesday was Bio CT. At least someone decided to cut us some slack. Overall, the paper was quite alright..only with some really confusing objective questions..Someone should mention the incapability for a pig like me to analyse complicated and confusing "things" although i remember that I was once told that pigs are fairly intelligent organisms. Then again, I am only a pig-let..Perhaps my brain has not completely mature yet..Blek..im being so crappy    Let me continue about my wednesday. I came home at bout 5.30 and then rushed to piano class. I walkedto piano class throughthe alley..so..on my way there..I saw a really tiny kitten..smaller than ur 15 cm ruler, hiding at a corner, purring so very loudly. It looked so   charm   (cantonese) (sorry ah..cant think of an english equilvalent for the word   charm  ) I was in a rush to piano class..so I had to leave it there..Then as I walked pass it, it purred even louder and it looked at me with those sad kitty cat eyes.. and when I reached a patch of grass at the end of the alley, I saw another kitten, most probably related due to its similar fur colour and size. But this one laid stiff on the grass and there was an open wound. A WAJA was parked next to it. I would think that it was the tyre that crushed the kitten and ended its innocent life. Don't get me wrong, I am not really for felines..just kittens..they look so irresistably cute and adorable..Don't u think? Cats on the other hand look more evil..My impression for felines has justchanged from bad to worseafter watching SHREK 2, two months ago, i think (the pirated version at yee's house). The puss in boots definitely proved that cats are just downright mischevious and evil.    anyway, enough said for now.    have to go offline..not like most ppl i know, i don't enjoy unlimited access to the net. Yes, i am still using dial-up.    Adios.
