If you ask me, it is absolute brilliance, cinema at it's finest.  I mean, Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla Presley,  AND  O.J. Simpson, who could ask for more?  What could ever be more romantic than "This is our hill, and these are our beans."  Honestly, I know it's sad, but I have been wanting to see the end of this movie for a while because they always use the "Stttrriiiike" clip on the morning animals and it makes me want to see that part of the movie.  It's preatty funny.  Anyway, I just had to share my good fortune with my peeps.  Peace Out, Yo!
