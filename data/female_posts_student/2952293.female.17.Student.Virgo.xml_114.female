Okay, my aunt is driving me crazy and I haven't been home in so long that I'm homesick. Yesterday we flew into Dallas (sigh, one day TK, one day) and then we had to take a train to a different terminal and my aunt just could not handle it. We went to Starbucks and, swear to god, this kid kept speaking but I could not understand one word. He was not foreign, okay he was a Texan, but everything he said, I just smiled and nodded. I have not found one understandable human being on this trip. As we were flying to Oakland this man in front of me glared at me, because I was speaking too loudly- I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF AND THE PRESSURE IS INTENSE UP IN THE CLOUDS, JACKASS! We got in around 12 AM their time, 3 AM our time. The place was BUMPIN' and it was annoying. While waiting for our luggage, this horrible, stupid girl kept flirting with this guy and he'd be like, "Is this your bag?" and she'd go, "No hehehehehehehe" for every bag that came before them! I was like, "When I grab my bag, I won't be too careful to NOT hit that bitch." Then we had to wait for the Rental Car Shuttle to take us to the worst rental car company, Dollar/ghetto. Two men: one was on the phone to the Philippines and it's like- hi, Hello...CUSTOMERS. The other was Indian or something and his teeth were messed up so anything he said was not understandable. They were closing right as we got there, fortunately we got our crappy Hyundai. Sharon, my aunt, started driving and the car was sounding horrible... we had the emergency break on. I took over, because legally I'm not allowed to drive (so you are an adult at 18, can drink at 21, but can't rent a car until 25... the US is stupid as shit), but my aunt can't navigate either. The 45 minute drive took us like an hour and a half, that's how bad she is. We rolled up around 2:15...CALIFORNIA TIME, 5:15 Ohio time! I slept on the air mattress, which sucked, so I made my aunt sleep on it tonight/she offered and I didn't refuse that much. Today we hiked along this mountain by their house (eww outdoors not for me, but my aunt is anorexic and freakish about the outdoors, so I went with it) and then went to Walnut Creek's downtown. It was nice. I wanted to buy this diamond ring I saw at Tiffany's- it was hot. We got manicures, too. The best one I've had- seriously she was so precise. Every nail she asked if it looked okay. I got a full hand/arm massage, 5 coats of shit, and it was only $10! If I found a place like that back home, I'd go all the time. Tomorrow we are going into San Francisco. I want to go to the Museum of Modern Art, Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, and take the cable cars and stuff. Okay... cable cars, those are the things at the fair! You know, a car on a CABLE. In San Fran- those are trolleys. Who backs me up on this? Well, maybe I should get some sleep, it's going to be a long day tomorrow. Bye!
