(or did i knock on to her..?) and i fell. ew.. my knee was scratched. ugly scars. wasn't really painful though. then they wanted me to be the goalkeeper. having to knelt on the floor, i guess it made my injury worse. but anyway it wasn't serious. it was not as serious as sisuan. so i shouldn't complain. furthermore, i couldn't catch the ball. i made the group lost. and i was like so lousy? run only like 1 min i was already panting hard. visions blurred. perspiring profusely.  i thought floorball would be fun. it was rather disappointing. 3 players against 3! and the game is lk only for 10 mins?! quite pathetic uh. very different from what i imagined it to be. floorball always reminded me of my ex-209. it was so fun to play with them. it was like 11 vs 11 people. so u dun need to do so much running. the whole of p.e lesson we were playing floorball. don't know why i enjoy their company more. perhaps we are more bonded together that's why.   i still miss them a lot. i always see them around in school but sad to say, we are not as close as we used to be. there are not many topics to talk about. sometimes i feel rather extra when i am with them. still miss the good old times, although it was barely three months. in contrast to my current class s209.. haiz. this class kinda sucks. the guys are really not fun to be with. they don't talk to the girls. when they teased boonluan, it gives me an impression that they are not trying to have fun at all. i don't really like them. they are mean. mean guys. my goodness. reminds me that i have not watch 'mean girls'. and even if i want to watch it, movie theatres are no longer showing them.   mjc is ridiculous. giving us loads of homeworks, making us have remedials after school. and futhermore cca ends so late!! there is no life in mjc. i don't seem to be able to enjoy myself. i don't have any free time. sometimes i feel trapped. but still, it was better than sac. back in sac, i was like suffering in hell?! tt's i don't miss sac. i prefer mjc though life is getting monotonous. it is still not as hectic as sac. i get to slack once in a while. i hope life gets better. if only my class is bonded together. yanting's birthday is on this coming friday (30 july). wonder what they will do. i think the class has completely forgotten abt it. poor yanting.
