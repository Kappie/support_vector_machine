Well actually something did happen, but its not like major or anything.  There was this kinda pale-ish blonde kid right and he's shorter than me.  He's kinda cute but he just has some clothing issues that I CAN'T EVER GET PAST.  So that pretty much means that he doesn't qualify as one of the few, the proud, the elite boys to have a relationship with.  Ok lets start with the first issue.  He wears the SAME FREAKING JACKET everyday.  It drives me crazy.  And its light brown, which if you know anything about me, you know that i do NOT like brown.  I have this urge to tell him that he needs to wash the freaking jacket every once and awhile.  Its also fleece which is easy to get dirty.  But thats not even the half of it.  HE WEARS BABY BLUE.  Normally i would not have a problem with this color, but this kid has to light of a skin color for this color.  Pastels make him appear to be washed out and sick looking.  It doesn't look good on him.  Ok next problem.  He wears white socks with slide sandals.  you know those sandals that are those adidas slides things that you can just put your foot right into?  He wears white socks with those.  AND his sandals didn't match a thing he was wearing.  honestly, if you're going to wear sandals in the winter, DON'T wear socks with them.  or you could just be smart and wear closed toe shoes.  but nooooo, he's weird and has to have bad fashion sense.  He walked past me and i was about to scream that a)his shoes didn't match his outfit, b) he was wearing white socks with sandals and c) what the hell was he doing wearing sandals anyways?  I guess i can't really talk, since i've worn sandals this winter, but they were dressy so i didn't have a choice.  Sorry, i know this whole paragraph sounded incredibly vain and spaztic, but seriously, when you can't match things, it bothers me.  Especially when it comes to matching colors to your skin color.   Nathan stole my purse and Lauren told me that i gave him the look of death right then.  i guess i didn't notice.  Nathan was all like "i have learned 2 things today.  Don't ever wear beige or colors that look bad on you because it bothers Taylor AND don't EVER EVER EVER steal her purse....if you value your balls, you will follow this."  It was really funny.  Not that i would ever purposely hurt a guy for wearing beige or colors that look bad on him, but if you steal my purse.....i swear its all over for you lol.  Sports Update: Stars lost on Tuesday to Edmonton 3-0, first shutout EVER for Edmonton against Dallas AND we gave up in the 3rd which was sad.  You can't say they didn't play well though.  Coppell plays Mansfield tonight in Duncanville and me and Brittany are coming along for the road trip! Starts at 6;30, come represent.  And now i have to run, hurrah for 3 4-day weeks in a row! one week until me, Brittany and Jess go to the Stars game!!!!  Look for us on tv, we're going to get on that jumbotron if it kills us. :)  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~
