Well last Friday Jean took me out for a beer. It was every nice of him.  My mom hasn't called in almost three days which is really weird. I think i will give her a call tonight. I guess there is nothing new going on at home therefore that is why she is not calling, I think.   If you want to talk about something interesting. Just leave a comment and i can talk about it on the webpage. Anyways i have to get going. Have a good day!
