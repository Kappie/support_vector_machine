Future Horizons admits their products are highly experimental but the Ecktoplasmic Oscillator sounds promising. Some of these plans are for out-of-body time travel, but if you can build the Hyperdimensional Resonator, you may be able to travel in corporeal form, which would be my preference.  If it works for you, will you look me up in 1999 and tell me to go to law school? That dotcom thing didn't go so well and the parental nagging  will never stop .
