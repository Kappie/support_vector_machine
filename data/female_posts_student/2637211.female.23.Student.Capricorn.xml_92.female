I think I should go to law school. I really want to be a young, successful professional. I was thinking last night about it, and it seems like the best option. I finish up with the history degree, start working on the LSAT, and apply next year while I have some weird job. I might be able to talk my mom into helping me find something (she works at a temp agency), or I can look into finding some kind of entry level job, not tell them I'm going to law school, then leave after a year, with more experience under my belt. Hmm.
