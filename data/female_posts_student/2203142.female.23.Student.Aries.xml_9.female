I don't know for sure, but I think that he had some part in spurring this creative surge.   Anyway, what I really don't know about this poem is whether the translation does at least 50% justice to the actual poem. There's no one here at least in Peshawar who could help me find that out. I mean, no one who is an expert in both languages who could say, ok, this is a good translation or a bad translation. Khair, let's see. One of these days, I might get lucky too. (:   I Always Get Late (Belated)   I always get late in doing things To say something, to keep a promise To call him, to beckon him back I always get late. To help him, or to sympathize with my friend To meet someone on ways unrevealed I always get late. To put my heart in the changing seasons To remember someone, to forget someone I always get late. To save someone from some grief before death To tell someone that the truth was something else I always get late in doing everything.  Munir Niazi
