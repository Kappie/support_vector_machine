(Please stick to only one. Changing   occasionally   is not a bad thing.) These characters from now on will meet on IM, Blogger IM. Please begin your participation with a bio of some sort. For any sense of sanity, we're leaving out screennames on this; it'd get too confusing for anyone unfamiliar with the shows referenced, which include:    STARGATE: SG-1   (DISCLAIMER: "Stargate SG-1" and its characters are the property of MGM/UA, Double Secret Productions, Gekko Film Corp., Showtime/Viacom and USA Networks, Inc.

The original characters, situations and story are the property of the author(s), and may not be republished or archived elsewhere without the author's permission.  YUYU HAKUSHO   Other than that, I have one thing to say:  Any use of copyrighted material is for the enjoyment of participants and readers only. We are getting paid only in our dreams, ie. not at all, not a penny, not a pfennig, not a pound, not one Euro. This is just fun. Any recognizable characters are the property of whoever holds the copyright or the author.  More will be added if more needs to be said.
