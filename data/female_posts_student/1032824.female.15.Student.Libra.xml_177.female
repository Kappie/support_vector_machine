The first photo depicts myself studying for Physics rather seriously, then subsequently I lose control and my brain breaks down and * snoorrees... * ;)    Alamak , so many random thoughts. If everyone chips in 2 dollars each for Jeremy's birthday present, he would be able to go to Linkin Park's gig. He hinted to me yesterday. I need more time. If I were to go to the Band Concert on Tuesday, I would have to make up for the hours lost to study Chinese! I feel as though I have lost a lot of blood. I have Chinese tuition on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday next week.  Monday is  the day . After  the day , I will watch movies!     GIANT MOSQUITOES!!! TOODLES KIDDOS! * Smucks *
