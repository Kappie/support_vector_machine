This house I was brought home from the hospital to, in mid-May of 1981 during the infamous memorial day floods.  I've rarely admitted it, but it is indeed a most beautiful home, and I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that it's located on one of the finest lots in Austin.  A 1/2 acre, taking up virtually an entire coul-de-sac, in the heart of Westalke Hills and 10 minutes to just about anything.  And this house, the house that my grandfather designed...well, naturally it would always seem perfect in my eyes, as I've grown up here.  White stucco, with fine gates and a courtyard, and a sign on the front that reads "La ultima casa"--which means "the last house" in Spanish.  I'm not sure whether that's just irony, or if that sign was a hint of things to come: not only am I the only one in my family who speaks Spanish (which would make it all the more bizaare that my grandparents would put up a sign in Spanish well before I was born), but this is apparently not the last house.    I've always intuitively known that it would never be  my  last house, but I had always assumed that Mimi and Opa would never move.  Our family flirted with moving when I was in high school, but their answer was always "we're too old to move."  Now it seems we are moving out of this house out of necessity--necessity for a one-story house in which my handicapped grandmother can move around in, and the necessity for funds in order to provide for my grandparents during the remaining years of their life.  And of course, there's the little fact that I'm actually leaving--for Tulane in August.  This is it--this is the end game.  I will be leaving Austin and won't be returning to live for a very long time, if at all; I would like to receive my Ph.D. in International Relations from a school up in the Northeast after completing my Master's program.  So, with virtually nothing to hold them back, including their granddaughter, my folks are saying goodbye to the house they never imagined they'd be leaving, and moving to a very very tiny town about 50 miles west of Houston.  Why are they moving to a city with maybe a little over 1,000 people?  Because there are 3 people down there that count--their daughter (my Aunt Rite), and their other 2 granddaughters, Jamie and Brandi.  For 23 years my grandparents have taken care of me and pretty much have had me to themselves.  Now, thankfully, they will be spending some quality time with the rest of our small immediate family.  I know that this move will be the best thing for them, as I was not planning to ever again live in this house anyway after finishing my education.  I keep telling myself, "It's just a house, Rose.  It's just a stucco building."  But no matter how much I try, I can't convince myself of that.  It's more than just a house.  I've spent my entire life in this one place, with both good and bad memories.  And then, like 'the twinkling of an eye', everything is drastically thrown out of its usual abode.  I'm not implying that's a bad thing--I'm just saying that it's bittersweet and overwhelming.  ~~~~~~  On a completely different note, I am scheduled for my laparoscopic surgery on the 24th of May.  Nothing major, but hopefully we'll figure out what's causing me all this horrendous pain.  I'm actually quite terrified that the surgeon will come back and say, "Sorry!  Didn't find a thing wrong with you.  It's probably just your overly-sensitive stomach."  Sorry, I don't buy that answer--this pain is not all in my head.  A "sensitive stomach" wouldn't keep me bed-ridden for nearly 2 weeks straight, with the feeling that someone is stabbing me in the ovaries.
