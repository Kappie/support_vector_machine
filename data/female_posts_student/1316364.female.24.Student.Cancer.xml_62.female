After surviving a weird viral throat infection and getting food poisoning I am less than happy to announce that the seasonal allergy bug has decided to move in and take over and just when I thought nothing else could go wrong too. Other than that things remain the same for me. I wake up each morning and got to work, when it slow at work or when I am home I make it a point to log on to the Internet too see if Jesse is online and that’s my life in a nutshell (Pretty boring, if I do say so myself).  In other news, the FRG has decided to have a meeting next week to propose a reelection of group officers because there is a lot of people who are not happy with that is going on with the group, although that is not the reason they gave us. :-)  They actually stated the positions that were filled were only temporary positions and now is the time to reelect people we feel are suited for the job. I wasn’t able to attend the last meeting but I have spoken with a few people in our group afterwards and understand why this has been brought to the groups attention and feel that it is a good idea to hold an election.   I think this is a good move for the FRG and something that needed to be done a while ago. It also gives the people who want to be involved a chance to be part of the process.  If the ARMY can’t be organized then at least the FRG should be.
