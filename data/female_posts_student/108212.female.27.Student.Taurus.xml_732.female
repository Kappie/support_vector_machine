Thanks for the kind words, you guys.  Had Chorale and Organ last night - this is gonna be hard.  Pia:  Check out the book for Never Ending Story - excellent, especially for a translation (from German?  I think...).  I read it to my kids before the movie came out.  One of the best book concepts ever!  Ching:  urlLink IMDB  has a  urlLink joint ventures  feature:  Joint Ventures Here are the titles which credit the individuals Minnie Driver (Actress) ,  John Cusack (Actor)   Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)  7.4/10 (13530 votes)    Or was that cheating?
