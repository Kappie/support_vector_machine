I think of Ro and I find her gaudy hot pink AOL background floods my conscious.  I haven't purchased stamps for months.  I very rarely hit print; instead, I am bookmark happy.  Yet my office is far from paperless.  I judge a book by it's Amazon.com page. It takes a leap of faith for me to do business with a company that doesn't have a domain and matching email accounts.  I tried to order pizza online last week, but, surprise!, the outlet in my town was not equipped to handle online orders.  I drive across town to get coffee at a wi-fi enable cafe.  As I was scanning a 12-pack of Diet Coke at a local supermaket, the store customer service walked by and told me that she hated automatic scanners because they take away jobs. I didn't know how to respond, as I never come face-to-face with those losing their jobs.  I have cell phone service when hiking in the mountains.  I refuse to install a home voice line.  I no longer get excited about Sex In the City.  Now I think pervasive computing is sexy.  My mother is on match.com.
