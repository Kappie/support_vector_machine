He simply gets out of the boat, walks across the water, unsnags the line, and walks back across the water back into the boat.  The next day, the New York Times's (a  very  liberal newspaper) headline read "Bush Can't Swim."  Ok, maybe not as good as I originally thought, but it's a lot for my dad to tell a joke, so bear with me.  Ah, going to get my schedule today.  Hope it's good.  Anyway, I guess I'll see some of yall at least today.
