J.Lo is a typical hispanic girl w/a pear shaped body, hair that grows down (instead of back) right at her hair line, and has no physical feature that is even remotely special.  I don't hate her but I do think she has issues.  She makes people have this idea of latinas, that they are all sluts.  This is obviously a stereotype but she's just making herself look so ridiculous.  When she was with Ojani Noa, she was into "looking hispanic." Notice she sports her natural hair color..  Ex.    When she was with Puff Daddy (whom she met while married to Ojani), all of a sudden she was ghetto and trying to act "gangsta."  Ex.     Then she was with Chris Judd and started dressing w/indian  hippy inspired clothing and a more relaxed look to match his look.    Ex.    Then she meets Ben Affleck and all of a sudden she dresses w/ more class.    EX.     Case closed.  JLo sucks, which brings us to our next topic...Britney.  I was reading this blog...this guy is great !  His blog is so much fun to read.   urlLink VividBlurry  has these really great pictures of Britney and her new fiance.  Here's the link to the pictures...   urlLink Britney, putting more in her mouth and hand...then the usual cigarette.   That is soooo funny...use your imagination.    Anyhow...somehow, I really don't have anything against Britney.  I think she is like many women at her age.  I'm about the same age and most of the things she does is not much different than many girls my age do.  So she likes smoking,drinking, and partying.  So what ?  Everyone at her age is doing most of the same things.  The only thing I think is stupid....is that fact that she doesn't want to sign a prenup with her new Justin-look-alike fiance.  That's just plain stupid !  She's worth so much money, she should have her lawyers decide this type of stuff.    There's another picture of Britney, that  urlLink SmitHappens  (btw..this site is also very funny) has on their site...     In this picture she is probably telling him what she is going to do to do him.  Basically, what it looks like she's doing in the pictures that  urlLink VividBlurry  has.  You would think she would be a little more careful...considering there are so many reporters out there trying to catch her doing something like this.  Or maybe she didn't give a fuck, got caught up in the moment, and know has pictures on the internet to forever remind her of this fun day..=)  Anyways...I felt like bagging on celebrities today.  Probably cuz I'm having one of those days where I feel like a fat ass and wanted to point out other people's imperfections.  Definitely, starting my diet today.  I'm still what is considered "skinny", but this extra weight just doesn't feel right.  I'd rather be fit...than voluptuous.  Ok, I'm done bashing.
