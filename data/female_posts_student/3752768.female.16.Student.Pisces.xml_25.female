Ashley came over and we had girl talk because she was going through hard boys times. Then today I went to my S.A.T classes and they were boring as usual. My dad came and got me then we went to get Ryan and we went home and watched a movie...it was an old '80s movie. Then  my dad went to church and me and Ryan and Renee and our cousin Jeff were there. Me and Ryan were watching t.v. and we sucked face for a while...hehe... So yeah that was my day! hehe...It was alright.
