       
      Celebrate life,  live, laugh, and love  Celebrate friendship,  Let it bloom and grow.  Celebrate love,  give the untried a try.   Let your hair fly and float  in the track of the wind.  Let the moonbeams come home to your eyes,  and let the sunshine glow your face.  Dream the fairy fantasy,  And grow wings to make it come true.   Let the pain of your heart drip dry,  Unleash those salty crystal tears,  Trap them in a bottle, cork it,  and send it up river with your fears.   Celebrate your loved ones,  Celebrate the blessing spread around you,  Celebrate the sunshine, the rain, the flowers,  Celebrate life the most precious gift of God.    ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
