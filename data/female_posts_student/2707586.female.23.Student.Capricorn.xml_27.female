From a ways away all I could see was the ears sticking out and I was like "what in the world." I knew Brendan was at MIT but this kid looked just like him. Of course as he got close I knew the head wasn't big enough and the face was all wrong but by looking at his ears I thought "That has to be a Wells." I have great news for all of those concerned about my roomie situation (the 40 something Filipino wife and mother of two living in my room). Geraldine will be returning to the Philippines next Monday so hopefully I will have my own room for the rest of the semester. I will miss her some but having my own room definently outweigh the loss of such a nice person. In other news I am incredibly busy in school and I am wondering why I am here. Not really, this beats working anyday but wow are they piling it on! My spring break plans are still up in the air but I think someone is putting a bid in on my parent's house so I am thinking I should go home and throw about half my stuff away so when they move they don't have to do it for me. I don't know when I am going to make it to VA but I will sometime I promise.
