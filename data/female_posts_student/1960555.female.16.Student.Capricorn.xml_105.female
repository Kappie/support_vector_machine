(i saw it last night for the first time.)  i couldn't even get over how good of a movie it was.  then i was thinking about other movies i've seen on tv lately.  Rock Star, Crybaby... all excellent movies.  so this is what i did.  i got out of the shower, threw on a towel and came up with this list.  it's a work in progress, so have mercy, but these are the best movies i could think of this morning.  all these movies ARE classics or sure as hell WILL BE classics.  go and watch them all.  it'll enrich your life in some way or another.   TOP 20 MOVIES  3 Men and a Baby Almost Famous* Chicago* Clambake Dazed and Confused Edward Scissorhands Empire Records Ferris Bueller's Day Off    Finding Nemo* Harry Potter 1-3* The Hole* Lord of the Rings 1-3* Powder Pretty In Pink Rock Star* Shrek 1+2* Sid and Nancy Stand By Me Sweet Sixteen Weekend at Bernie's  they are in alphabetical order mainly because i couldn't choose a number one.  as will you notice most of them are pre 1995.  movies post 1995 are all crap.  honestly, good movies went out the window with the millennium.  sure, they're okay to watch once or twice, but can you think of a single new movie that could be regarded as a classic.  nope?  yea, that's what i thought.  some of those are just good movies that might need to be replaced.  i'll think about it a little more, but for the time being, these are wicked enough. (* note that they are post 1995)
