On the other hand, that means I get to go to the Fall Out Boy show tomorrow night. And...I am the only damn person on the guest list for that show. That's right. Guest list, VIP, awesome shit.  Because hey...I'm awesome.  Whoo I'm excited. It's gonna be a damn good show. And if I have any trouble getting in, I'll just talk to the tour manager, and it's all good. Got the HOOK UP.  And...I am hungry. Amazing. Really. Think it's time I go get some foooooood.  Why do places close so early on Saturdays? It's like...hey...screw me over why don't you.  Quite literally.  Tomorrow night is gonna kick ass.  Hunger is an abnormality, crazies.
