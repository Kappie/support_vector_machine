Saturday once we got all done showering...by then it was like 2...we went to church and met Jeff and his family. We named Jon his son the Mobb Father. It was funny. I think we scared him tho...but I guess thats what we do best. Then we started figuring out our whole ground and saying what everyone was...like Ross is the oldest...im the youngest...Kaits the tallest...Jon has the longest hair...lol Yeah it was pretty funny. Then we did like nothing all night...and went to bed early since we were so tired...  And today we went to church and layed around all day...We went to Walmart and got shirts that we're gonna write on next week when I come down...we're gonna have fun with them. So yeah....I had fun. I got the How To Deal soundtrack at Walmart and Im listening to it now...I have two favorite songs...I'll probably end up puttin the lyrics to both for the quote cuz im to lazy...So yeah...  We finally got our tv working back here and right now Im watching the cd kait got me of all the rally pics...that and this music...*sigh* im down. Oh well. Im just really missin Ross...and Todd said he shoulda asked if he wanted to come along when he picked up Kait. *sigh*...So yeah...I think I'll go watch Backdraft now...later all...   7 Days  Till I go to Humboldt  9 Days  Till NYE   Tara   Current Music:  Promise Ring   Current Mood:  Down  Quote of the Day:  Promise Ring:  Long ago, I drew a light into the sand Dreamt across and held your hand Band of gold, protect us from the bitter times It comes to wash away our wounds with time  Hello you, hello me, hello, hello Can't you see? Love is more than, more than it seems So, I wear your promise ring  Promises made under the light of spring Heavy on a summers day Saying no, I've grown to where the spaceships land A million miles between my mouth and hands  Hello you, hello me, hello, hello Can't you see? Love is more than, more than it seems So, I wear your promise ring  Love labors through the night It breathes and never fights And like a sheet, it lifts before it dies  So don't forget, just like cash, I walk the line Like a soilder guarding what is mine  Hello you, hello me, hello, hello Can't you see? Love is more than, more than it seems So, I wear your promise ring  Wear your promise ring  Wear your promise ring I wear your promise ring
