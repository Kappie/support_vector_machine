We talked a bit and stuff like that. I love him. Honestly I really really do. I'm sorry for ever hiding that dumb blog but yeah. It was just stuff I wanted to clear outta my head. It wasn't meant to be hidden. 'Cos that's the place where I blow off MAJOR steam. Anyway... I didn't mean to hurt him. I'm sorry Nima... Please don't let out your emotions by working out too intensely. You're gonna hurt yourself badly like that... and you know how I feel about you hurting yourself... I love you and you mean so much to me! I can't even start to describe how I feel about you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for ever hiding anything from you, for ever hurting you, and for doing anything and everything that makes you unhappy. I'm sorry. You have no idea how sorry I am. I love you. I have to go to dinner now. Blog later... tomorrow.   To make a long story short, I LOVE YOU Nima... I mean it. Never forget... the last thing you do.
