I am not permanent And the only thing keeping me dry is where i am  You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex A stranger with your door key explaining that i am just visiting And i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving  D.C. sleeps alone tonight  You seem so so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex A stranger with your door key explaining that i am just visiting And i am finally seing why i was the one worth leaving The district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lights And send the autos swerving into the loneliest evening And i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving
