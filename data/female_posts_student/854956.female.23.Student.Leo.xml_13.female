Yeah, my Mom got me a frog "cellbaby"... haha... I attempted putting it on, but my phone is about 1/4 to 1/2 an inch too big... :-(  Oh well... another note... I got a bunch of pics because my Mom took a disposable camera of mine to have the film developed (she had a coupon to get a free picture cd).  Anyhow... it brought back good memories... :-D  Thing I would appreciate comments about:  should I use the Cell Baby.... or just keep it as another frog novelty item to add to my growing collection...?      urlLink  postCount('cellbuddy');
