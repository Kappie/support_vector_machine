But  noooooo  she can't be.      *SIGH* Well, today is Friday the 13th... I've heard that weird things can happen.. Maybe I'll get a boyfriend today? Or be offered a recording contract? >oP  I just looked at my S assignment sheet- it doesn't look hard at all! I'll probably be able to finish it in like, two nights. I know I was  supposed    to make a start yesterday arvo, but nyeeeh. Since when do I keep my own promises?      I've been having really weird dreams lately... Like, everything that takes place is so stupid.. Last night, my whole family (kooky grandparents included) were involved in some Tennis tournament... BIZARRE. But I guess they're better than the dreams that cause heartbreak when I wake up.. Haven't had those in a while...      I'm getting so much better- I'm thinking less and less about Mark... It's great because it usually takes me several months to get over someone, and it's only been about 2ish weeks. *SIIIIGGGGHHH*      Kate is reading my fanfiction on the computer behind me... Kinda worried because I can't write stories for shhhhooott. Well I'm gonna go look for info about Old English sheepdogs... I want one!      Useless Camille Fact #758: When I get an Old English sheepdog, I'll call it Martha or Aubrey.
