If you don't get it by now i guess you'll never get it. I just wanted to say that i wish things could go back to the way they were ..... yeah, this is out of character for me, but i love you and and i miss you and really wish we could be together again... and after i write this you probably still won't figure it out.. how obvious can i make things? And if you do know, but u don't feel the same anymore you could at least say so. I mean really, yeah i'll be sad, but i'll just be worse off if you keep on forever. *sigh*... i can't think of any more words to say at this point.
