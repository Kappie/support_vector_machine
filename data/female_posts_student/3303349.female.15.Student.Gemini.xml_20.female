And then we had a guest speaker for like two hours and then Mr. O'Hara went on and on about what to do if you didn't pass aand so I was litterly ready to kill him by the time he finnaly passed them out to us. It was crazy!! But  now I am happy that I passed that because it was so majorly stressing me out. Now I should eat because I am starving and I will probably faint if I don't!!
