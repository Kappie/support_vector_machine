He's butt ugly which makes it really bad. I mean if he was cute, that be a different story. Then I wouldn't cared if he waited for me outside the girls bathroom (yes he has done this). But the fact that he's ugly, very strange, and his lisp is always cause to make fun of him. As Tim and I did, it was so funny. He just stood there next to me and we were making fun of him and he didn't do anything. I wonder, was he stupid enough that he didn't even know? Yes, so it shall be interesting the next he see's me to see if he still likes me.
