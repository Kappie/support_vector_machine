Then you look to the other side of the world and a group of teenage girls are putting on make up and going to clubs looking like, you know what they look like. Teenage girls whose only problems in life are 'oh my gawd, you did NOT just say that to me!' and 'he just looked at that girls butt! can you believe it? the nerve?'... And they dont think for one moment, how lucky we are to be alive right now. Not starving. Well off and we actually have beds to sleep in! It pisses me off how some people are just so ignorant and unhappy, creating little problems for themselves while others, across the world have bigger troubles to deal with. I wish people would be happier, I wish they could see how lucky we are to look around us in this European or American world (whichever you are in) and think to ourselves, you know, I really AM lucky.
