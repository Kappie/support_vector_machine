Turns out it's just supposed to be a first draft. Haha. So I abused that and made my first draft really sucky. Yay. :D  So how is everybody? We weren't able to meet this Monday. So I'm expecting our next meeting to be MORE fun-packed than usual, hehe. Oh, and I'm going to be treating you guys to sundaes on the Monday after my birthday! YAY! Isn't that fun? Haha. Sorry, that's the only thing I can afford at the moment. I'm just a poor girl. :( Pulubi ng Ateneo, hehe joke. :D Pero seriously, money is very hard to come by these days.  Rogee and I went to UST today with our buds, Kiko and Rocky. Rogee, I'm really sorry about the crappy service. You know, if you guys hadn't pulled me back when I was ranting at the window today, I would have asked the guy what the absent employee's name was and march up to the Rector and have that guy fired. I mean, he's been absent for what, TWO DAYS? Poor MedTech and Education students. Tsk tsk.  What else should I type.. Oh. I saw DA LAB OF MY LAYP (eww.) in UST today. Felt sad when I saw him. :( In fact, I was even able to write a short letter to him which will always remain unsent. If you want to read it and laugh at my mushiness, it's here --  urlLink click .  Oh. This is getting to be really long. Sigh. Oh wellers. Good night guys. See you on Monday.  HUGS! :D   edit  I just realized.. I am not king anymore. :( I gave Eumir my title because the kingship was too much of a hassle. So from now on it's Queen Karla. :D :D :D queens are waaaaay more powerful than kings anyway. (Think chess.) Bwahahahaha. But that doesn't mean Queen = King's wife. NONONONONO. NOT EQUAL! NULL SET! Hahaha. =D
