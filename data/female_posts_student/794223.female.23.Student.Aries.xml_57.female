"You are my friends, and the greatest love a person can have for his friends is to give his life for them."  After seeing the film, I turned right to these Scriptures:  Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say?  'Father, save me from this hour?'  No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.--John, 12:27  Who do you think you are?  Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.  Though you do not know him, I know him.  If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.  Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."  "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I AM!" -John 8: 54-58  Lord, Thy will be done.
