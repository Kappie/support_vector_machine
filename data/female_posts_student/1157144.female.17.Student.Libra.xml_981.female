So i was like sure, I hope I am old enough to buy them.  So Jason and I go, and I put the lighters down on the checkout thing and the lady (which i thought i recognized from when i went to pre-school at ATLC) was like, I'm gonna need to see some ID for you to buy these.  So I was like, how old do you have to be, and she's like 18, so I was like, Jason, you better show her yours, seeing as I'm not 18.  So that's ok, and then she's like your total is... so I go to pull the 10 dollar bill out of my back pocket and she's like, HE HAS TO PAY, so i was gonna give the ten to jason but she gave me this hard evil look so jason had to pay.  So as we were leaving I was like, Jason, i didn't know it was that hard to buy lighters and then we get in the car and jason's like, you want me to buy ciggarettes for you too now? and i was like, suck a dick, trick.  but then we went to tower and i got the new incubus cd and discovered i had 10 dollars on a tower card i thought was empty.  go me!
