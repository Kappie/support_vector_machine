The wrestlers are sooo freakin awesome!! lol its fun ridding that stinky bus with those guys. Theres this girl, Laura Greene who used to be a matmaid and comes along to help every now and then, no one likes her. I get on the bus and i hear..oh yeah, laura is coming too. I tell Leslie to sit with me so laura doesnt. They all laugh, yeah..i made a funny..but i kinda felt bad, well maybe not bad, just i didnt want her to hear what i had said. She ends up driving herself there and back all by herself and on the way home a wrestler was like "so which one of u matmaids wants my beef in ur taco?" There is only me and Leslie so we both laugh. Someone then starts talkin about Laura and how they all want her number and they bet she'll put out for all of them. It was soooo mean but harlious. Even the coaches were laughing, even meanier. I then got home about 9:30ish and talk to Lorne.Kristen calls me and tells me she has some news. She tells me that her, joe, and lorne were all talkin and decided that joe liked me and lorne liked kristen so we were gonna swtich. WHAT THE FUCK?! i about had a fuckin cow. Then i hear kristen laughing saying GOT YA!!! omg she scared the shit outta me!!! lol She then laughed and made me promise not to tell anyone, but that Lorne is gonna ask me out this weekend when he comes over. YAY!! He told joe and joe told kristen but lorne made joe promise not to tell ne one..and then joe made kristen promise not to tell anyone..but hell i know now and trust me, i'll tell my friends HAHA. It would be kinda fun to go back to school and be like..yeah lorne and i are dating now..i wish kristen hadnt had told me, but then again...i knew it was coming. Lorne and i are like the perfect couple. Tonite we were on the phone and i was fighting with a diet coke box to get a soda outta it and i couldnt get it open so i grabbed a knife. Lorne was like, why dont u just get a kinfe? like the second i grabbed it. We laughed about it as i stuck the kinfe in the box..not thinkin about the sodas inside..well the knife goes through a soda and it starts spraying EVERYWHERE and im like OMG lol and we're both laughing our heads off over my stupid diet coke mess. We talked on the phone for a pretty good while, for about an hour and a half. Our shortest phone call ever. haha I really like Lorne and i cant wait until saturday nite when he comes over!! yay!!! I tell him around 11:30 that i gotta go do hw..lol he doesnt want me to go but i dont want to go either..but i gotta do what i gotta do. Lorne and i arent even offically dating yet and im already starting to think about how stuff will go and how long we'll last. I dont want to get hurt, but i think he knows that. Ive always been so jealous over people who have a bf or gf, used to piss me off, but now that im sooo close to having that i dont feel the same like i used to. Thats all i used to want, but then..i guess now that i'll have it im worried of what we'll do and what will happen to us since he doesnt go to MA and we wont get to see each other everyday. Another thing, girls like lorne..all i hear about from his friend is how like 5 girls are jealous cuz lorne and i are talking and they dont have a chance with him...damn..what am i gonna do with a wanted man?! haha Trust him i guess. I hope i can..i dont want to turn into ex who is labled "pyscho bitch" LMAO Naw, i do worry about how well i know lorne. Ive only known him like exactly a week i think. DAMN thats not long. But we talk so much its like ive known him longer..he told me he feels like hes known me his whole life..wow idk if i feel that same way, but ok. I'm going out on a limb here to do something and get something ive lately been dieing for. Here he is..what i think is Mr. Perfect and he came around at the right time in my life. I'm truly happy..but nervous about what im gonna say when he asks me out HAHA besides yes that is.
