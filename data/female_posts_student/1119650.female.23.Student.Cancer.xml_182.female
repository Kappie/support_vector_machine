Cons  I want to smash my face with the claw end of a hammer to get rid of sinus pain My nose wont stop running I'm tired as hell Im weak and don't want to walk around.   Pros  You get to watch all of the good daytime tv, including dawson's creek You can walk around the house in your undies 'cause no one is around You can blog and IM all day while everyone else rots at work You can eat when you want to eat  Now that I think about it, being sick all day sounds a lot like Boz's life.
