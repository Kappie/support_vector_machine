Britt is still at her babysitting job and Jess is out hanging with Jordan and his posse or something before Jordan leaves to go wakeboarding or something like that.  I think i will go out in the manual car later and do something.  i dunno, it depends if i actually want to move from the computer.  I read up on the CBA thingie for the NHL and their economic/political problems......in my opinion we're screwed and we're probably not going to get a season next year because the little superstar hockey players like Mike Modano and Sergei Fedorov don't want to give up some of their precious money in order to save the game they love most.  Same with owners of the clubs too, they don't want to fork over some money either.  I learned this off of Step by Step today at my babysitting job, that the fans are the ones who make up the sport and without us there would be no NHL.  From what i read, if both sides would just make salary cuts and make sacrifices (but namely if the players would just make financial sacrifices such as shaving off a few million dollars from their salaries and paychecks) then we wouldn't be having this problem.  I dunno, i just pray that this season wasn't the last.  alright well, i'm out because i have nothing more to say.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
