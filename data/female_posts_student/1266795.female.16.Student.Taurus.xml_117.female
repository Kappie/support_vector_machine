Then we get out of school for winter break Dec. 23rd and go back January 3rd. But we do get "flex" days, meaning our spring break is March 23rd until April 4th. Eh, that could be worse. Ah well. Ha! Prom is 4 days before my birthday!  And there is still an honor's night. I'm not going. I hated it this year. Don't ever want to go again. Ah well. That short rant is over.     So yeah.     I went to lunch with my dad and Sarah today. That was....stressful. I think that it was time to talk to him again though.  So yeah. He still wants to meet Nathan. And yes, Sarah, my father does like you. I wouldn't worry about it. He likes most people. Ah well. It was an interesting time. We talked mainly about school and such of that sort. So yeah. Don't worry. I am still alive and he didn't really upset me. I told you all I could handle it.  See? Strong Ashely! (Who still can't spell her name! Ah well. C'est la vie!)    Well, Michael, you just signed off, but you never gave me that link, so I won't be clicking it anytime soon, will I? (Long story. WAIT! You're back!)  I'm too lazy to delete this paragraph, so deal.     Well, tomorrow I am going to Kokomo with Sarah and her mom I think. That should be fun.      "Shall we go to bed?"
