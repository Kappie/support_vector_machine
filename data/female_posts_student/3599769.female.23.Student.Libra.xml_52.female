I was fine, but then I had to cancel a client who was'nt qualify so now I'm back to square 1. I just wish I could fly to Greece, where in my mind nothing bad happens. Or to the make belive world that Legend takes place. All those posies flying around and unicorns playing. Minus the part where everything turns dark, because everyone knows your not supposed to touch the unicorn. I dont't even know what I'm rambling on about now. I just wish everything was my definition of normal.
