A PhD does not make you courteous nor well mannered.  3. Poverty does not make you unhappy. But wealth makes you dissatisfied.  4. She who sits quietly by will be just as quickly insulted as those who are not quiet....but the quiet ones often get to hear it right in front of themselves.  5. Politics suck.  6. Ashes to Ashes and Dust to Dust....We are that which is in our hearts, minds and souls....we are not that which lies within this multihued sack we call skin. And skin color....is the most ridiculous notion. It does not exist in death.   7. A rich man's bones will crumble just as quickly as a poor mans.
