Haha it was a banger tho...and we ate dunkaroos so that pretty much was a party anyway. www.williamhung.net is the place to be. I want to marry him. He's my little chinese chipmunk. Rachel wants him too. I was so bored today that I watched MTV Hits and noticed that they were showing the same lineup of videos just now that they were when i got home from school....i could actaully predict what the next one was going to be. Honestly.....that is sad. 1 week, 2 days till i'm un-grounded. Amazing! Oh and my family will be in VA for prom weekend so i'm thinkin prom after-party at my hizzouse! Wat up my Andreas..i miss u have fun with Ter-bear! Ahh it's time for some eyes shut. Peace out my negros!         ::At night i pray...that soon yor face will fade away:: Megzzzz
