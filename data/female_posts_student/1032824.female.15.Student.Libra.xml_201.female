I could still remember distinctly, how devastated I was though, when I realised that they had splitted up. It honestly came as a shock to me.   "There will always be sunshine after a rainy day"  -- Quoted by Mr Lee, and true enough, Katie Underwood's debut single was on sale after some time, likewise for Sophie Monk, and now, Tiffany Wood (Now known as Tiffani Wood). I have yet to hear from Sally Polihronas and Belinda Chapple though.   Going crazy over Bardot brought back so many memories. I made so many friends, especially  Nora, Juliana and Lyanna . Then there was this time whereby I pon-ed school to meet Bardot at the airport, spent heaps of $$ on pressies for them (Juniors please do not follow me) and got punished and grounded by my Dad. On the other hand, I believe that during this period (Year 2001) it has been rather fufilling, mainly because I have made heaps of friends and also because I have been very thankful, not taking anything for granted.  I am actually waiting for the clock to strike 12 before I can sms  Jeremy  (as requested by him) to wish him a  Happy 16th Birthday!  Hahaha. ;) I also received news from  Daniel Faizal  that he would be leaving for NS tomorrow. Good luck and wishing you all the best!   My Dad is in the middle of the climb now, I wonder how is it like living on a Mountain? My family and I just prayed for my uncle and him. They will return on Thursday, I can't wait to listen to their adventure!   Til' then, goodnight, don't let the bedbugs bite.   I've got news for you, just remember I can be  poison . I can be poooi-sonnn....
