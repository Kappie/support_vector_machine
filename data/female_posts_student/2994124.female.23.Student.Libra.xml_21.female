So today is Thursday - TV night for some :) but here it is just work and bed.  Hopefully an early night actually.  I haven't watched TV in ages. There doesn't seem to be anything decent on at the moment. For some reason I keep thinking it is Friday.... anyway I was supposed to be going to see Cathy Burton tonight but my friend didn't book the tickets and then changed her mind and didn't want to go anyway and I didn't want to go on my own, so here I am. Maybe I should listen to her music now and I could pretend I was there. Has anyone heard of her? She is really cool. Beautiful voice and really good lyrics.  There is this one song called 'Take me out of here' which I used to play really loudly in my room when life wasn't great!  Saw my CPN today, and as usual she was late.  My appointment was 10:30 but didn't go in until 10:50. So normally at 11:30 she says we have to end but I just kept on talking so she couldn't say anything. Then at 11:45 she said that we had to end and I said rather sarcastically "yes well I suppose I have almost had my hour now haven't I"  She wasn't much help again today. Just told her about the Therapeutic Community (she doesn't know that much about it, she didn't even look round there before referring me!) and then we talked about the Rachel problem.  When I said I was trying to think of all the possible solutions and so far I had only come up with: 1. wait for her to contact me 2. contact her and say it was all my fault, take all the blame 3. contact her and say that I'm not taking all the blame, the CPN helpfully added -"well you could always call her and scream down the phone, or put a brick through her window"  Very useful, sensible and mature suggestions I thought. Who was the professional and who was the patient again????  Looked after the kiddies this afternoon. Hannah is 6, Paul is 4 and Ruth is 2.  Ruth wasn't feeling well - we think she is coming down with chicken pox and so she all she wanted to do is be held.  They are really huggy kids generally, which I love.  It is like the best form of therapy. Can't wait till the baby comes in April and I am going to have tons of 'therapy' with her!!  Right must go and do some work.
