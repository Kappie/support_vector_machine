Niko was doing pretty good excpet for this one pass that he let get away that could've been potentially dangerous.....oh well.  CHRISTMAS BREAK STARTS TOMORROW AS OF 2:40PM!!!!!  Thank God, i don't think i could've made it through another day.  And that means Christmas is closer! yaaaaaay!  Siru was so happy about her new boyfriend that she said she was going to get me the biggest bag of finnish gum that Finland had to offer...yaaay i'm going to be set now.  Sarah, Nadia and Nathan all gave me their Christmas presents today!!!  Sarah gave me a MAGIC 8 BALL PEN!!!!  Its going to be ordained by god just like my big magic 8 ball, lol.  Nadia gave me a christmas card that she made herself about Bop-It and Hockey sticks......it was really funny.  Not to mention the SUPER AWESOME socks she gave me plus tons of candy!!  Nathan gave me a little angel ornament in the awesome-est gift bag EVER.  Today sucked until the hockey game which was cool.  I got to see Brittnee, who i haven't gotten to hang out with in awhile.  Then i got to see Marlo which was cool because i haven't seen him in awhile.  Aw man at the game tonight, Brittany said some hilarious things: "I would have said.....Soooo.....when do we get to makeout?" Britt: i'm acting like such a retard Me: well actually that's quite normal for you.... Britt: um...ok.... *40 mins later* Me: my shoes aren't as white as they used to be... Britt: kinda like you!!! Me: What the hell is that supposed to mean? "so in theatre....*looks over her shoulder*....we did this"   Yeah so anyways, Cowboys won 4-0 but i must say this was not one of our better games......I wish TJ had been in tonight, Ozowski makes me uneasy about the agme especially after that game with Marcus when we almost lost.  Scary stuff.  hmmmm ok as much as i would love to keep on writing, i did absolutely no hw tonight because of the hockey game so i need to work on it/get sleep. Maybe i'll just do it in french......i dunno  NHL = non-stop hockey love (lol Brittany),  ~~~Taylor~~~
