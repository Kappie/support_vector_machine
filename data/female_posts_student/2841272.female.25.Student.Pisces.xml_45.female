I really only have two complaints about this movie. 1) It was a little long, 2 hours and 45 minutes, I would say about 20 minutes could have been cut and then it would have had it's ideal length. 2) The writer's took quite a few liberties with 'The Iliad', the epic Homer poem the movie is based upon. One could go on like this all day. But the amazing thing about all this apparent disrespect is that it doesn't really matter.   Troy   is such an exhilarating piece of epic filmmaking that it pulls you in, sweeps you up and works very much as its own thing. And at the end it has basically taken us to roughly the same place as homer, capturing the pageantry, political complexities, and rich characterization of one of Western literature's great masterpieces.  Set 3,200 years ago, the story deals with the Greek war against fellow superpower Troy that's sparked when Troy's prince, Paris(Orlando Bloom) makes off with Helen(Diane Kruger), the wife of Menelaus(Brendan Gleeson), brother of Agamemnon(Brian Cox), the Greek King of Kings.  The Greeks draft their great but reluctant champion, Achilles(Brad Pitt), raise a fleet of 1,000 ships and sail across the Aegean Sea to get Helen back, but Troy lies behind huge walls that have never been breached and things quickly get bogged down. In Homer's version, the quagmire that ensues is seen from three perspectives: the Greeks, the Trojans and the gods, who take sides in the conflict and keep coming down from Mount Olympus to directly enter the fray as allies of the mortals. Peterson left the Gods out of this movie, which I feel was a smart move, the movie might have been four hours long if he would of included them.   Peterson then faced a question that all film makers face when making a historical epic. To go with the gritty realism of   Master and Commander  , or the romance of   Gladiator  . Peterson went with a little of both. Through it's graceful battle scenes, not one but three romances. And in a most satisfying way it leans away from a movie depicting men in war, and towards showing the spectrum of strengths and flaws that each character has.  The movie's strongest point is it's casting. Brian Cox gave us an incredibly detestable villain in the role of Agamemnon. Brendan Gleeson shined as the brutish Menelaus. And a great performance by Peter O'Toole as the aged, weak, yet undeniably noble King Priam of Troy. Orlando Bloom strikes a chord in the thankless role of Paris, showing us a self-centered softness, but he also gives us a cowardly sense of vulnerability and self disapproval that explains why his family and nation would stand behind him. In the role of his brother, the great Trojan hero Hector, Eric Bana delivers the performance of his career. Bana is so unexpectedly strong and yet so sympathetically human that he all but steals the picture. Brad Pitt also found a character that he could lose himself in. He gave us another incredible performance(same level as his portrayal of Tyler Durden in   Fight Club  ). In Battle he makes you believe that Achilles is an unstoppable killing machine that knows no equal. I could not imagine anyone else cast in this role.   Grade: B+
