Non-Candid Quote Goodness:  "If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make, who would you call and what would you say? And why are you waiting?" -Stephen Levine  "You have to forget about what people say, when you're supposed to be loving, or when you're supposed to die. You have to forget about all of these things. You have to go on and be crazy! Craziness is like heaven." -Jimi Hendrix  "Sometimes the little times you don't think are anything while they're happening turn out to be what marks a whole period of your life." –Andy Warhol,  The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again   “The key to faking out the parents is the clammy hands. It's a good non-specific symptom; I'm a big believer in it. A lot of people will tell you that a good phony fever is a dead lock, but, uh... you get a nervous mother, you could wind up in a doctor's office. That's worse than school. You fake a stomach cramp, and when you're bent over, moaning and wailing, you lick your palms. It's a little childish and stupid, but then, so is high school.”-Ferris Bueller  “I will sing of your mercy that leads me through valleys of sorrow to rivers of joy.” –Jars of Clay, “The Valley Song”  "I wish there was a knob on the TV to turn up the intelligence. There's a knob called 'brightness,' but it doesn't work."-Gallagher  “And I'd give up forever to touch you/ Cause I know that you feel me somehow/ You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be..” –Goo Goo Dolls, “Iris”  “When did the logo on our shoes become more important than the hearts on our sleeves?” –a Champion commercial  "I feel so high, I even touch the sky above the falling rain."-Bob Marley  "Every man thinketh his burden is the heaviest."-Bob Marley  "If a man should importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I find it could not otherwise be expressed, than by making answer: because it was he, because it was I."-Montaigne  "If love is worth less because it doesn't last forever, then life must be worth less for the same reason."-Henrik Oldin  "I was blind all the time I was learning to see."-Grateful Dead  "I have my fingers crossed on a shooting star."-The Wallflowers  "The courage of the poet is to keep ajar the door that leads into madness."-Christopher Morley  "You never know how you look through other people's eyes."  "To keep silence is painful."-Leo Tolstoy  All My Weirdness  Sarah: Erin, what are you doing? Erin: Eating my young.
