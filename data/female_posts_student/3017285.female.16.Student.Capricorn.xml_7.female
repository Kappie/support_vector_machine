I get claustrophobic in elevators. And the school one makes strange noises...I nearly panic every time it stops because there's a bit of a delay untill the doors open. :( Sorta pathetic, I guess, but that's just me. My knee is in leauge with the forces of evil.  The school computers are so slow. It takes them about 10 minutes to open the stupid Login-window. And they're all iMacs of course *grumble*  But, it's friday, finally, and I can sleeeeeeeeep tomorow  ^_^
