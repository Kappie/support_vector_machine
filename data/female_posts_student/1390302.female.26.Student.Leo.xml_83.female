Behrman   Well, school is finally out for Matt and I –at least for the spring- and we both passed all of our classes…though Matt was unsure about his Physics class.  I got two A’s so I am pretty happy. I actually started this semester with 15 units and finished only 6 so I have been down on myself for that, big time!  But hey, at least I finished any of it so I can’t complain too much.  I suppose I shall be glad when we are finally going to a University and I can begin to feel as though I am actually getting somewhere on my education.  So enough of this education banter. I’ve had it –at least for now.  Though admittedly there is not much else going on.  I applied for a writers group.  If they accept me then I will be able to get college credit and learn to write from a mentor.  I am actually really looking forward to it, though there are fees and I am not sure I shall be able to pay them!  Here’s to hoping, right?  I think it will be a miracle if I am accepted anyhow, considering that my education is rather meager at the time being.  There was a writer’s test, it was free, so I figured that I had nothing to loose!  Other than that I am endeavoring to read  A kiss of shadows  by Laurell K. Hamilton.  I have read the Anita books, which have me absolutely hooked- so I figured that if they’re good so too should be the Merry Gentry books.  I sure hope so.  I think I am going to go stark raving mad with the wait for  Incubus dreams  by LKH, which is out in October!  OCTOBER… I can’t wait that long!!!  Guess I’ll have to give it a try…  Otherwise, everything is just fine and dandy here.  I am trying to put more time into my writing and I hope to have several books read this summer, possibly including The Fountain Head. I haven’t read a book in like 3 months and it’s making me nuts!  Reading is an integral part of my existence, it’s like breathing - if I don’t do it I cease to feel like me, Kristyn!  So I am going to endeavor to read a few books over the summer.  Summer session doesn’t start until June 2, so there’s plenty of time.  After that I am taking only 2 Internet classes, so I have no on-campus classes, yeah!  Okay, enough is enough…   ~Kristyn
