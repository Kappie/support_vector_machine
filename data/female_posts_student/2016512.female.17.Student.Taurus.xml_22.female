I kinda wanted someone to tag along, but I think it will be nice having a little alone time in which I can pretend to sing. Music tends to make me feel better, assuming it's positive music. Or negative music that sounds positive. Like punk rock--I can never take it seriously, no matter how serious the lyrics may be, and that's why I love the genre so much. Big band jazzy music makes me happy, even though I don't really have any. The closest thing I have is "Luck be a Lady" by Frank.  Ugggh, I really need to get going now. I have to be back to town for damned Pippin practice.  The show would be  nothing  without me!
