mark2: wow we acually had a convo  BluCrushed3: lol ya BluCrushed3: we actually did hello im mark2: good job hello im mark2 signed off at 10:54:44 PM.  BluCrushed3: lol Previous message was not received by hello im mark2 because of error: User hello im mark2 is not available.  so I really like Mark and he is the only guy that is really safe in my opinion, but he needs to have someone to actually date. So whats a girl to do?
