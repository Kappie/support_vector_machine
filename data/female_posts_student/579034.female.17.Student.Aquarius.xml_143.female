Okay, so Thursday I picked up Deb and we went tanning and then after I dropped her off I went to get my hair done and then redone cause I looked like Medusa. So then I get home and I relaxed for a bit, slept. Then I got ready and Fea (who looked very dapper by the way, all the guys did) picked me up around 5. We got to Ambro's and it was like a huge gathering of parents and teens in prom attire. I swear I felt so like super star cause all the parents had cameras and stuff and kept makin us take picture after picture, I swear I'm gonna have like 10 of the same picture on my camera. So then we climbed into our rolling Roman palace (no joke, the limo had 6 wheels, marble floors, Roman columns, and Roman statues in it) amd we to the prom. It was actually really fun. Danced with Fea a lot, hes not too bad a dancer. John was rippin up the floor, let me tell you. The best part of that was seein Mr. Boardman and Mrs. Gerdies dancin. It was great. I hope all our pictures come out. Don and his girlfriend were so cute by the way, they just looked so happy. So did Deb and Dave and Erica and Doofy. They just looked so great together, all happy and smiling. So after the prom we went back to Fea's house to change. I LOVED my after prom outfit even though Mick didn't like it too much (took pictures on my WebCam and sent them to him). I wore this like short pastel green skirt with this white halter top that had like a cherry pined to it with white high heels, I felt so girly and pretty, aside from my Medusa hair.  So the boat was an experiance. We saw these like black guys with all white suits and pimp hats and canes. The dancin was the best part. At one point me and danielle were dancing and this black kid was tryin to get inbetween us so we just kinda moved closer together and then Tom, Liz's boyfriend goes "That kid was staring at you two." and I was like I know. Then, a few minutes later he was back and kinda tryin to dance with me so I just kinda started to dance with this kid Tom brough, can't remember his name though. So yeah, then after that there was a comedy thing on the top deck with this black comic/ magician. Interesting mix huh? But yeah, he picked out John and kinda joked around with him for a bit and then he did a few more jokes but, he wasn't the greatest. Then he did this talent thing where he mad a white kid rap and then a white kid try n dance with a black girl. It was kinda demeaning but oh well, I guess they feel we deserve it.  After that it wasn't much fun. They served a ghetto Continental Breakfast and then we docked. People were gettin kinda fed up with each other cause now the drinks were being brought out. Stasi and Melca were pretty bad.  When we got back to Deb's we all changed and then they all really started to drink. Me and Fea didn't have anything and Rubin only had a little and I don't think Deb or Dave had too much or Danielle or Morgan but Erica and Stasi and Dave were bad. As soon as we got to Deb's and he changed, Dave just collapsed on the floor.  Then Vin and Erica started and she got really bad. Vin, John, and Rob were outside with Deb's brother and his friends so God knows how much they really had but I went outside cause I couldn't listen to Erica anymore. When Deb came to get me and told me to come back inside I found out Vin had thrown up all over himself and Erica was REALLY out of it. At one point after we put Erica in Debra's room, and Vin was on one of the couches I felt his head and it was warm so I put a cold towl on it and all of a sudden he gets green and looks like hes gonna puke. I put a bucket that was close by under his head and away he went. It was so gross. I yelled for Debra or Dave (her boyfriend not Melca) and Dave came by and took over and I went to check on Erica who was all upset she ruined Debra's prom. Later, when Vin was still kinda outta it, he kept tellin me he was sorry and that he dissappointed me and he won't do it again, but I guess he don't remember any of that cause I heard he said he has no regrets.  so yeah, then, when Vin was comatose and Erica was sleepin and things calmed down we made panckaes and I dunno just sitting around Debra's table eatin pancakes with my best friends I realized that, no matter what I say, I'm gonna miss them when I go away. Almost makes me not wanna go. I mean I realize at this point how special they are to me and how much I love them. I really could have spent every day of my life like that. Just all of us together, takin care of each other. I love them all so much.  The meet wasn't too bad. The best part of that was when we all sat down together to do a crossword puzzle. Yeah, Coach K did most of it but i got Sticky and Globes and Ella! Then that night I went to Fea's with John, Rob, Dave, and Rubin. They taught me how to play poker but then I think they regretted it cause I kept winning through Rubin's help. So, in the end we combined forces and split the money. I only put in one dollar but I got back three so yay for that.  And that was my weekend. Today I just have cleaning and homework to look forward to. x0x
