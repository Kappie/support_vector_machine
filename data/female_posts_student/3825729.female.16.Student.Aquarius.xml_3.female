Speaking of food, I had the best dinner the other day.  Went to Moxie's on Robson with some friends, had calamari and canelloni... so good.  Best damn canelloni I've had, and that's sayin' something, since I'm Italian.  Best calamari, too, but that's not too hard to do.  Don't get good calamari too often... *giggle*  Ooo, last night my friend Meg slept over, it was so much fun!  We talked to random people online and ate Timbits and made huge friggin' sandwiches in the middle of the night.  Also plotted horrible things... like putting makeup on Gabriel.  Too bad if he dun' like it, Meg'll do it and it'll look GOOD, damnit!  MY BOYFRIEND WILL BE MADE UP!!  Hmm... Gabriel... that's a pretty name, for a guy.  It kinda suits him, given he's really cute.  I have this thing for names... Gabriel, Amadeus, Vincent, Tristian, Angie, Collin, Joel, Ashley, Kelly, Calan... there's so many guy names I absolutely adore, can't list them all.  There's some nice girl names, too.  Meagan, Anastasia, Lara, Kristina, Amy, Carrie... *bounce*  I like some names for guys you'd usually think would be for girls... Angie, Ashley and Kelly, offhand.  There's a couple others, but I can't remember them right now.  Not so many the other way 'round, though.  I dunno, girls with guy names rather annoy me someimtes, it's just like, if you're gonna have a good guy name, be a goddamn guy!  Bah!  Bah I say!  But yeah, names aside, eyes... oh my god, eyes.  Gimme someone with beautiful eyes, and I melt.  Just friggin' melt.  You can tell so much about a person by their eyes, it's incredible.  Gabe's got beautiful eyes... I love the color, and everything... amazing lashes, too.  It's not fair, guys get the nicest lashes all the time, and 99% of them don't give a shit.  Mine're okay, at any rate, so oh well.  Arg.  Monday cannot come fast enough.  I wanna see Gabe! *throws pointy things at time as incentive to hurry the fuck up*  Hmm, the crows outside are leering at me... it's kinda scary.  They did it the other day, too... I was just sitting here, and suddenly, "*leer* CAW!"  Six friggin' crows sat on the railing and glared in at me.  Not so fun, sometimes.  But anyway, I should go attempt to clean my room.  It's a hopeless battle, though, since I'm just gonna get it messy again in two weeks anyway.  But oh well, this'll please mom, or something. *shrug*  So I'm off!
