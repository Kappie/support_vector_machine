The emptiness, The constant hunger for what I strive for, More than immortality, More than my own life... Answers My mind seems never-ending, I am trapped living in it, Deep down inside... Surviving in the painful silence, So icy cold and fearing being hurt again, I'm too scared to move Frozen thoughts Aching soul Suffocating dreams The sun used to shine on me, I knew and felt about, Something they call happy I always knew just where I wanted to be That sun is gone and, Replaced by night... I only know misery and greif, I don't even recognise myself Losing grip of reality, Slowly letting each drip of blood, Drop and take away... My sanity
