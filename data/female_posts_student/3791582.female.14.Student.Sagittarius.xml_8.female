Yea, we love the adrenalin in saying goodbye and the rush we get while we tell ourselves “you’re not going to cry,” So when they ask us if were okay we say “were just fine,” is fine supposed to look like this?  There was a time I couldn’t stand not knowing who I am, but that times passed and I’ve decided I’m better off believing the worlds all flat, than trying to explore every curve.   yes, i know:i suck. but im trying! :)  all work © smokeycustard
