Our lecturer, Dr Tony English, has the reputation to be a very good teacher, interesting but tough and strict. He has been teaching for 5 years now at Flinders University and before that, he spent a lot of time as a business consultant in many countries in the Asia-Pacific Region.   This morning was an introduction of the topic and what we are going to study. His class seems to be very organised and I enjoyed a very important point he made about the objectives of this course: to get general knowledge about the historical, cultural, economic and political aspects of the countries in the Region.   Being French, I never had the chance to study a lot of those aspects of this Region when I was in High School. I studied French history, a bit of American and English history as well as WW I  II. Because the program is big and the time allowed for history/geography classes is short, I think we try to learn about our country first. I can't say I know everything about Fench history but I learned a few things that help me to understand the French society and culture today. " Our history builds our present!"   Anyway I am looking forward to learn from this topic and I am sure I will enjoy it as the lecturer seems to be really good and interesting!
