So, new semester... nothing's new my classes are carbon copy of last semester... except of course for the people in them.  I have no complaints... and would like to say "hooray for no more kyle cottrill in my history class!!!  sorry kayla :-/  Well last week was formal... not to bad... not all that great either... but at least i got to get all dolled up for once.  I fell asleep watching Finding Nemo at Laura's house.  It's quite funny actually... EVERYONE fell asleep watching it... except for Kyle... who had been on the road at 6 that morning and wrestled about 4 people.  kudos for Kyle Davis (not Cottrill.. never kudos for Cottrill)  So, next day, tubing at Great Bear... oh what fun and FREEEEEZING... but once again i survived... barely.. i think i was close to loosing a few toes.  Hmm... then we had Bells.  When kayli and I got upstairs... we found MK and Laura sleeping infront of the door to the bell room... awwww.  Then Kayli and I got locked out... in the COLD.  Then we played bells and Pat picked on me.    Mary Katherine: I'm sorry Pat!! there's a reason I...  Pat: no Mary Katherine just get it next time  Mary Katherine: No Pat, there's a reason why i can't tell the difference between black and white chimes  Pat: Because your sister is Elizabeth  !!!! Well.. i never... also.. when i couldn't get the stupid and of 3... she threatened me by saying she wouldn't let me stand by Chad.. doesn't she get we'll talk anyway?  oh well...  After bells Kayli MK Chad and I went to Qudoba.  The second time that weekend for chad and myself, but it was delicious all the same.  I dropped off MK at home and then went to kayli's where she and chad and I watched Pirate of the Caribian (sp???).  It was a good time had by all and Karl made us popcorn balls.  I spent the night then went home and went CRAZY at my house.  aahh too long here and anyone could loose it.  So i hung out at Chad's.. went to March of Dimes... then back to chad's watched a movie... beat chad at pool 7 times.. okay sorta not but he did loose... and was late getting home.  Okay so that was last weekend... this weekend is booked full of me being sick sick sick... so... send me a singing telegram or something... cuz i deserve it :-D  Cheers
