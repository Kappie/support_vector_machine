The legal definition of stalking is that it cannot occur in a public place....ex: me seeing adam havens shirtless at a sand volleyball court.  lol, he chose to be shirtless in a public place, so therefore i am not stalking him.  thank you for your time.  oh and the house thing, that event took place was with 10 other girls, yeah so we're all stalking him.....go figure.  Oh yeah and since you like to believe that i hate you, its not technically hate per se.  its more like i don't enjoy your talking about me and things you don't know much about concerning me.  Personally, i think that you should stay in your own business, but thats just me. But i don't hate you, so stop telling people that....thanks.  You're probably a nice person, but you've tainted that of what i could've thought of you by talking about things you don't know very much about. Again, thank you for your time.  partying it up with sarah now!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
