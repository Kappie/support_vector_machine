I was always fascinated by masochism, even before I truly understood what it meant. I tried to understand why someone would enjoy feeling pain, and it was always described in books as a physical thing. Until I read the Kushiel books. In the second book Phedre talks about her fights with Jocelin and how she treasure every one with him, and that the pain of the body is nothing to that of the heart.   Emotional Masochism. It was then I began to understand my own fascination. I thought it was physical though and for the most part I ignored it. However, time progressed, and I found myself being yelled at by people who were special to my, and I found myself relishing every tear I shed over it and even forgiving them in a subconscious desire to shed more in that unbelievable pain that can only come from your heart bleeding.   This was nothing new. You can ask that boy I mentioned in my first entry, and he'd say that over two years, he'd broken my heart and crushed my spirit and infinite amount of times and every time I came crawling back to him.  I don't crawl anymore, and I thank whatever deity may be in existence for that bit of pride. But when someone hurts me, it makes me want them around more. I want to be hurt. I even talked about it a few times with people before this, but it all comes crashing down when he yells at me and calls me names, and I still forgive him, because I enjoy shedding tears.   Is it a weakness? Is it an advantage in that cruel world to want the pain that you're eventually going to get. I really don't know. I just hate myself for forgiving people who have hurt me in ways I can't begin to explain.  Hating life and enjoying my own self loathing. That's my fate...  Talk more later, Faylinn
