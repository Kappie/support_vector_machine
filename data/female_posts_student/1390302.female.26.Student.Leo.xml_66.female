I am full of them; cliché’s that is.  Yet the one that bothers me the most is “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade” what the hell does it mean, really?  The best I can tell you is that it was probably, at best, some off the wall saying by someone who had very few lemons!  Truthfully and realistically, I understand it’s meaning.  When life hands you a bad deal or things don’t go your way, deal with it.  Yet I still cant help feeling like it’s a useless saying.  I do, however, acknowledge the fact that this particular saying could have been coined by someone who had more troubles than I do.  I just don’t think so.  Realistically when you think about it, would this adage help anyone?  Would it have helped the Jews in Nazi concentration camps?  Would it have helped the Russians or Chinese living under fudal, totalitarian governments?  Would it have saved the South Koreans when North Korea was trying to overthrow them?  The list goes on…  Then answer is no.  So what I have come to decide is that “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade” is a decidedly American saying.  It goes to save those few souls who burned the cupcakes for their daughter’s class and had to go to HEB and buy some instead, and the little girl who fell off her bike and skinned her knee.    So why the rampage?  I have been feeling lately that instead of dealing as the adage would suggest, most of us just push our problems aside and try to forget them.  For better or worse, most of us simply try to deny that we have the problem to begin with.  The good ol’ American way, at least under these circumstances.  Now don’t get me wrong, do not mistake me for unpatriotic, I am certainly none of that.  I just get the feeling that, perhaps, we are a country of live, learn, and deny…  Not always and with the coming of George W. Bush we are certainly a society that seeks vengeance on those who have wronged us, as a whole… My comments pertain to the individual not the whole.  So perhaps the adage “one bad apple spoils the bunch” is a better way to look at it.   Lately I have just had the feeling that in my own life I am less than successful at dealing with my problems rather than ignoring them.  So I am among those who have failed to make lemonade, and if I hear the old adage once more I am going to scream!  I’m just not that tolerant.   ~Kristyn
