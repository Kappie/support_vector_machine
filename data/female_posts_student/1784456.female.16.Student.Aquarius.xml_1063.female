Speaking of crap, my parents have just been watching a really fascinating documentery about the history of toilets! Did you know that the dude who invented the first toilet was called Thomas Crapper?? Arghhh I've been flicking through the yellow pages for ideas for work experience - did you know that there was such a thing as a sewage consultant? Eugh, why is everything about poo???   Ok, so tomorrow, we are expecting... Me! Katie, Laura B, Beki, Jess, Emma, Kim, Laura H, Claire, Emma Bexon, Dave, John, Vinnie, Seb and someone called James Dixon??!!??
