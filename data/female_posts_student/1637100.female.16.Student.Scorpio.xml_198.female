AHAHAHAHA tomoros class challenge i dont know if im going though because our class seems quite unprepared. we'll see. i'll have to ask first if i can stay home, and i highly doubt that my parents will let me stay home. oh well. i guess i'll have to go. yay. well, time to practice before i go to piano. double yay!!
