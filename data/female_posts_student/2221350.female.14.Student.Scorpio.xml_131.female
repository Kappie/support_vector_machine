Whether or not the fiber is a good thing, I don't know yet. We just like to talk. We talk about movies and poets and  urlLink  sex bracelets   and our favorite things.  what are a few of my favorite things? I self-absorbinately assume you ask?  *color-red then black then blue *flower-iris, a black bearded iris *dessert-rice crispies *name-coralie, celemene, timbre, Vincent, Isis, auguste, Marlowe, Sloane, Edward, maxmilien, Faustus, chelle((since I'm not having any children, you can place all these names with cats and/or fish))((but seriously, couldn't you imagine a big fluffy cat named Faustus?)) *smell-almond extract, gardenia, marijuana((not kidding, smells great)) *holiday-Christmas((someday the pagans will steal this holiday back! Until then, well, happy birthday Jesus)) *sound-an e minor chord on a perfectly tuned guitar, a kitten's meow, a thunderstorm *soda-diet coke with lime *actor-Sean connery, Nicole kidman, tobey maguire, john Wayne, Lucille ball, Brett butler, Richard gere *phrase-wtf? *curse word-shit ((prnced: sheete!)) *digit-right thumb *bone-scapula *body part-medulla oblongata((nope, didn't make that one up)) *time of day-night  whew... I stayed up all night watching informercials and now I'm in need of a nice cup o' jo. I decided the best way to get back on a normal sleep schedule((as in NOT sleeping past noon)) would be to exhaust myself so that I'll be in bed nice and early.  have I mentioned that my mother said I could have my eye brow pierced? Well I was fuckin all excited until mammaw overheard and said she would throw me out on the street if I had it done. a small fight about how piercings are removable and it wasn't life or death ensued between mom and mammaw. Well seriously, what's the big deal? I can ALWAYS take it out!  kittens, piercings, moving out for the whooole summer, all caput. My life is just one big disappointment! Woe is me!  ((lol)) ((too sarcastic to be pitiful))
