Just molding into another frame of mind. Im tired of feeling like im not my own person. I feel like im in a rut. Its really starting to catch up with me. Maybe this summer will be like a new beginning. I sure hope so. Maybe do some stuff i've never done before. Meet some new people, yuck i just feel....i dont know blah. I wish i could spend the summer in florida. I love it there its so calming ad makes you feel like a totally different person. I dont know if its the ocean or the people or just the change of scenery. The weather is alway so beautiful *sigh* well im gonna go talk to david now....
