Well to start with I just bought a new Harry Potter t-shirt. HELL YEAH!!! I have been wanting one so very much and it was nice to get one. Next my DAD is out of the hospital and I think he is doing well. I only heard him get up out of bed once last night, which is better than his usual every thirty min trips to the bathroom. I hope this time we can keep him out of that damn hospital. Lastly, I just want to tell you about my wonderful night last night. Let's see to start out with, other than my trip to the mall to get the Harry Potter t-shirt, I tried on jeans in vanity. Wow they fit. I think I have lost about five pounds this week and I plan to keep that up. Also me and Amber went to play pool and we had so much fun. There was this hot guy there with his girlfriend, but for some reason he would go out of his way to stay in staring view of me and also make little comments when I walked by. I didn't say anything to Amber about that because I am not trying to Talk to anyone right now (especially someone with a girlfriend). DID I MENTION THAT HE WAS HOT!!!!! Okay, I have to admit that I was thinking about taking him out back and it was flattering to know that I still have the touch to turn heads. Okay I need to stop thinking about the guy at the pool hall. Did I tell you that I won almost all the games against Amber. HELL YEAH I did!!!! Okay I suck really bad and she is better than I am but she would clean the table and then for some reason scratch on the 8ball. HEHEHE I WIN!!! It was just an all around good night. Thanks to Amber for being such a great friend.
