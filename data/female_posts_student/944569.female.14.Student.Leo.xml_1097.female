"I've been waiting in the dark for a long time, shining my beacon of hope through the shadow.  If you see me, don't you hide your eyes from me."   The White Rose is associated with purity, honor, and chastity.  It is governed by the goddess Artemis and its sign is The Cross, or Agape.  As a White Rose, you are a person of your word. You may have a strong moral code, but regardless of your virtue, you always stay true to yourself.  To you, love is the most pure of emotional forms and it's just a matter of waiting for it to bless you.  Some people may say you are too idealistic, but it's only because you don't want to mess things up.     urlLink What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
