I AM ALSO A VEGITARIAN ATTEMPTING TO GO VEGAN. if you have a problem w/ that, then go away.  If, for some reason, you wanna talk to me....  email- xXbloodyXvalentineXx@yahoo.com AIM- X2ndXheartbeatX MSN- cashdogg213@hotmail.com yahoo- xXbloodyXvalentineXx  First introductions. Hi, I'm Caitlin. Nice to meet you. Or maybe it's not, i dont know yet. If you're an a**hole, then I'm fairly sure it's not nice to meet you. I'm 14, and I'm a freshman in high school. It's not fun.  Now I'm probably gonna use this blog mostly for lyrics/ essays/ stories, but i'll include any thoughts about my day if i feel like it/  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Current Soundtrack- Ozzy Osbourne \m/ Current Mood- Tired and bitchy, so WATCH OUT   Ok so CAPT IS FINALLY OVER!!! I'm so happy it's not even funny. (For those of you that don't know, CAPT is the standardized test from Satan's whore-ish inner circle of hell.  Not fun at all, I can assure you.) I have to go to the library tomorrow to work on a project. fu-u-u-u-un. I don't wanna make my partner do all the work, but it will NOT BE HAPPY, cause i hate school and i hate the library.  Second order of business- political talks. BLAH!     If I Were the President    1. Universal Health Care  I believe that if someone is SICK, they deserve to get BETTER. I find it amazing that anyone could seriously feel otherwise. It's sickening that someone could let a poor man die of cancer because he can't afford insurance while they take advantage of theirs on expensive stress management, etc. They need therapy, but thats definetly not the kind they need. I wouldnt be able to sleep at night if i had that on my mind.  2. Make Adoption Cheaper and Easier  There is a huge population crisis in the world, and it makes no sense to have more children while so many are homeless and without families. But many people don't adopt because it's too expensive, or difficult. I'm not saying it would be easy, but I'd at least try.  3. Try to get Minority Religions to be More Acceptable  Not by changing the religion, by changing peoples opinions of it. Religions such as Wicca and Voodoo are looked down upon and labeled Satanic, merely because they are misunderstood. In truth, Wiccans (witches) believe that everything you do comes back to you 3-fold in this life. In fact, "An it harm none, do what ye will" is a strong belief of wiccans- translated into modern american english, it means "do what you want as long as you don't hurt anyone." That sounds nothing like Satanism to me.  4. Redistribution of the Wealth Yes, i know this is a touchy subject. But i believe that the people who have unreasonably huge amounts of money should give the unreasonable portion to the people who have unreasonably small amounts of money. Everyone should have at least a certain amount of money. I'm not saying that freeloaders deserve the same as hard-working people, but they should get something. If anything, maybe things like wellfare could be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  5.  Demilitarism I dont know if i spelled that right, but i want to make the military less glorified. There are kids who joined the military to go to college, and now they've lost their lives fighting our beloved POTUS's illegal war in Iraq. and that's pronounced "a rock", by the way. Anyway, ideally, each country should have a defense corps incase of terrorism, and nothing more. No warsif there's no armies to fight them.  Thats all i want to put now.  Later Daze.
