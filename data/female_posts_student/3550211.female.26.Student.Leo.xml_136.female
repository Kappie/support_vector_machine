Now I hear that the leather document holder was not “inadvertently” taken, as reported the previous day; it was Berger’s fault all along.  But there is no proof. Of anything. Boy, I bet Kerry is thrilled to have him on his team now.  Oh wait. AP has revised the story  again . Berger has severed connections to the Kerry camp.  Whoa. This ping pong game has lost my attention. I'm getting a headache from the constant back and forth motion: he did ~> this. No wait. He did   this side. Liar. He's on   I read somewhere, that somebody jokingly wanted to know if Berger was wearing boxers or briefs when he stuffed the documents down his pants. At first, I thought that was hilarious. But upon second thought, AND after picturing Sandy Berger in his underpants, I shudder at the thought. And now, sadly,  this  is the image scarred into my retina.   I warn you now. What ever  you do, don't picture Berger in his underpants!
