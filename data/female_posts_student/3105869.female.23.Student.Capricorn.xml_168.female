I'm okay but its one of those getting up in the morning and nothing you try on looks quite right.  It must be the Austrian weather induced sun deprivation, on top of SARS [bronchitis].  Or maybe its because I woke up entirely too late...7:12 and had to run through a shower, etc. and nearly fly downstairs to eat all of one little beany weeny sausage link and chug a miny glass of apple juice before running to the bus stop.  Did I mention I left my umbrella in my room again.  I walked outside looked at brother Todd and said, "Oh well, my hair's wet anyway."  Cochran's class was supposed to end early, but in typical Cochran style he said, "I'll give you back the couple minutes I owe you, by ending early."  No such luck, he carried us over and didn't even get around to handing out evaluations.  Got a cup of coffee afterward, i.e. espresso in a over-sized mug with lots of milk and sugar, two substances I wouldn't deign to taint my black coffee with in los estados unidos.  Well, maybe I will stay awake in class today.  She was reading basically yesterday, which apparently is hard to listen to even a Supreme Court justice do for an hour and 10 minutes.  I just hope she doesn't make eye contact again.  My face turns bright red, then pale white in all of 2 seconds, and I feel my eyes bulge in fear, probably like how a deer feels in its last seconds.  I am convinced I am sustaining heart damage from the skipping of beats that occurs during her eye contact, I also now have my reaction perfectly timed so when she looks at me, a quick smile comes across my face although I am really contemplating crawling under the desk and below people's feet to the end of the aisle and making a full sprint toward the door.  Okay, maybe I am being dramatic.  I think I just need some sun.  The dreariness and intensity of Sandy are a killer combo.  But then again she signed my classbook, pretty cool, huh?
