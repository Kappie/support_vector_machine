I have been back since around 2 yesterday afternoon and so far I have studied for my written exam at the DMV, I have gone to the grocery store twice (once with Jess and once with Mom), I have been to 7-11 with Bret, watched Sopranos, watched QAF, went to a hockey game with Bret, went to the DMV with my sister, GOT MY RENEWED LICENSE, DROVE MY SISTER'S CAR!!!, went to the Social Security Office with my sister, ate lunch with my sister and now I am home and wiped out. I love being home.
