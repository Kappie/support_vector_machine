Susan received a free sandwich at Arby's this afternoon, which brought up associations I have with said establishment's roast beef.  The associations stem from a drive through Bozeman a couple years ago with Natalie and the Boy, during which Natalie compared Arby's roast beef with a particular area of the female anatomy.  This whole discussion would work better if I remembered the actual line Nat delivered that fateful day, but that's beside the point.  The point is: the random, pointless stories I tell in this blog are much better when I take myself seriously in telling them, with a few flourishes of sarcasm and irreverence.  Recounting such stories only if they're important, relevant, etc. in the grand scheme of humanity wouldn't be very fun, as the above illustrates.    To drive the point home, let me tell you another story, plucked from the day's activities.  Stopped by Oracle-lady's office on the way to Civil Procedure.  She's good fun and is loose with her candy supply.  "Well, I think you're entitled to some Smarties," she said after I told her I was happy with how my first semester went.  "Or some Dumb-Dumbs," she laughed, referring to those little suckers the banks across the land have become famous for distributing, "depending on how you're feeling today."  I spied a third option (one might even say 'alternative'..gasp!), instead.  "Actually, I think I'll take a Nip."  I said, knowing the significance of such a choice was lost on her, but enjoying the joke thoroughly nonetheless.
