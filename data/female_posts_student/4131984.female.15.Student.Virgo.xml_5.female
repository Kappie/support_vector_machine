He had the coolest webpage and all his friends had cool weboages so i decided i want a cool webpage! I am always open to feedback.  Perhaps updating this thing (assuming I can figure out how it works) will keep me busy online.  I figured it out.  Today rehersal kind of sucked. Not for any real reason, it was just one of those long rehersals where not much gets done. All in all though I think that Pippin will be a really good show. I am just a player but I get to do a lot of fun dancing which really excites me. So far I am in the "dance break" of Magic to Do, I have a trio dance with Amanda and Jen in the middle of Glory, and a pointe dance with Amanda, Claire, and Sam for With You. Not to mention the whole show is Fosse choreography, some of it original. Natalie lifted it right off the video. So all this dancing has been keeping me on my toes! hahaha that was a dumb pun, sorry.  I went to breakfast with my mom this morning at the Tumwater Valley Bar and Grill. It was quite enjoyable. Although, somethimes she is relaly judgemental about my friends. But I still love her. She starts her new job at TriWest tomorrow. I think she is really nervous that she will hate it. I keep telling her that she won't, and I really pray that she won't too. She only left her company so that she could live here and not in Sacramento because it was too damn hard to not live with her family. So I am really praying that she doesn't think that she has made a mistake by leaving HealthNet.  And I can't stop thinking about him. It sucks. Seriously. WHY! (At this precice moment I am contemplating whether or not I put this link in my profile, and whether or not that decision affects what I write.) Yes I think I will change the subject now, for fear of total rejection and humiliation. Not that he even has my screenname.  There are no longer kids at CTE, and I miss them already. Wow, hear I am trying to impact there life when they really have just changed mine. Its funny how much you can learn from kids when you are trying to teach them. Here are some funny kid quotes: "Do you belive in Gawd? Gawd created all the aminals." That was actually said to Joe but I love it. "Caitlin! Make him turn around!" About 15 showcase girls refering to Rick and there obsession with him. "You look sexy like that Caitlin" James in front of 120 Arts Fewstival kids. Way to go. By the way, I looked "sexy" when I would put all of my hair in front of my eyes and put my sunglasses on. The kids loved it! Ahh, the simple joys. "No way, my muscles are bigger!" A five year old boy named Blue, to another five year old boy named Adam. I could go on and on, but seeing that it is 1:36, I am tired. But I won't be able to sleep. Man, I need to buy more Tylenol PM. That will solve all my problems, not that I have any real problems.. at least I'm not in Sudan.  Oh! Also today, Richelle came over and we watched the first 5 episode of Season 4 of Sex in the City. Good show, good company, the good life. She is coming over tomorrow to finish the other DVD she rented. Thank the Lord for Richelle.  I believe that is all I have to say. And If it isn't, I can just add another post.  Love and God Bless, Caitlin  "Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier." Mother Theresa
