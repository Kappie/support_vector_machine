I had studied my ass off and was hoping to do well on the exam. After going through a page worth of questions, I realized that I was totally going to kick ass on the exam. And, let me tell you, I should have known this was a dream/nightmare, beacuse I never feel like I'm going to kick ass on an exam.   However, suddenly, the questions no longer pertained to histology. Instead, the questions seemed to focus on the entertainment world. Who is Britney dating now? Why did Penelope and Tom break up? Things of that nature. Now, let me tell you, I used to know everything about the entertainment world, but, sadly, all that information had to go when I realized that I actually needed to study in medical school. So, as soon as I saw these entertainment-related questions on the exam, I burst into tears. Again, only I would freak out like this. Thankfully, it was all a dream.  There's no way that Taube would ask questions about Nick and Jessica, right? Right?!?
