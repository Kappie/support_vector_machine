But who made me shout? She keep on saying and i was like"ya,it is my fault". Hey,i got temper and patience.I kept controling my anger cos it was really not my fault. Until the last period, i cant stand it cos she just pissed me off just like that. She say i am petty. What if she was the one who didnt do anything wrong and someone keeps saying she was the one.Will you get pissed off. I am not petty it is just that why she can be angry but not me. I am human too. And the another one keeps stepping my skirt and causing footprints on my skirt. It was so dirty . So unlucky that i met cor,juli,sharon and jia rui at the bus stop,and the moment they ask me what happen i just break down. I hate it so much.   Today i didnt really talk to her acceptabt the class thingy. Alysia they all ask me why i am angry and dun be angry with her. But i am really mad. I noe friends normally qurral ya then after awhile they will be ok. So let it be for awhile.    Went town with misa to shop.Ok that is very tired cos i actually wanted to go home early and sleep ya. We went to many places.town really changed alot.Haha... Going to buy milk chocolate for my faezah hahaha... Promise her liao ya.
