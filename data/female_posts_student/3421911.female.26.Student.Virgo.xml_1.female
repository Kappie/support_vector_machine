Taylor used to play drums for Alanis.  hehehe).  people usually get a haircut when they're depressed,i got a haircut 'coz i was depressed.  Alanis got a haircut 'coz she's happy.  weird, huh?  but then alanis is  sui generis , she is a class of her own.     i feel good everytime i hear her new song Everything.  it makes me wish i can find my own "Ryan" to make me feel so happy i can sing, walk along the desert with a guitar in my hand,wearing my powder blue halter top, sporting my new do :)    Everything  I can be an asshole of the grandest kind  I can withhold like it’s going out of style  I can be the moodiest baby and you’ve never met anyone  who is as negative as I am sometimes  I am the wisest woman you've ever met.  I am the kindest soul with whom you've connected.  I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen  And you've never met anyone  Who's as positive as I am sometimes.  You see everything, you see every part  You see all my light and you love my dark  You dig everything of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can’t relate  And you’re still here   I blame everyone else, not my own partaking  My passive-aggressiveness can be devastating  I'm terrified and mistrusting  And you’ve never met anyone as,  As closed down as I am sometimes.  You see everything, you see every part  You see all my light and you love my dark  You dig everything of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can’t relate  And you’re still here   What I resist, persists, and speaks louder than I know  What I resist, you love, no matter how low or high I go   I'm the funniest woman you've ever known.  I am the dullest woman you've ever known.  I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever known  And you've never met anyone as, as everything as I am sometimes.  You see everything, you see every part  You see all my light and you love my dark  You dig everything of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can’t relate  And you’re still here   And you’re still here  And you're still here...
