Nothing too out of the ordinary.  I got first chair at region orchestra so I get to go to Area... me and Leah are going all the way!  Congrats to Lauren, too- we owned them all : )  Cowboys won the football game yesterday.. *sigh*  Oh well- I have orchestra next weekend so I don't have to go to the game anyways.  So all of you should try really really really really hard to come to the concert Saturday @ 4.  I'll be in the last orchestra to perform so even if you can come late, still come!  Nimitz HS.  Be there.  New tri started.  So far, it's easier than last tri because PreAP Physics was replaced by regular Pre-Cal.  And wow.  What a dumb class.  I should have taken PreAP but, considering my class load, I just wanted to take one regular class that I could semi-blow off.  Band has been kinda sucky.  I hate playing for Mason, mostly because he doesn't know anything about oboes, so I just get yelled at for things that I'm doing correctly, but he thinks should be done differently.  The day of orchestra try-outs, he told me that it was "too late" and there was "nothing I could do at this point", and then I got 1st chair.  Take that!  Oh well.  Got my solo the other day- I totally love it, so that's good.  It's much more exciting to practice than the all-state stuff.  Let's see... what else... I saw Matrix Revolutions at the IMAX on Friday- that was pretty cool, although we had to sit in the front and my neck was killing me by the end.  Went to CiCi's and Kid Country last night after the football game.  That was a lot of fun... Chmiel is a crazy kid and I was glad I invited him along.  You should hang out with us more often, Clayton!  I'm soooo looking forward to Thanksgiving break.  I need to clean my room and do nothing but sleep and have fun.  Just one more week :D  Cool song alert! "Dare You to Move" - Switchfoot "Hey Ya" - Outkast     Alrighty, I'll see you cool kids later.  Have a great day!
