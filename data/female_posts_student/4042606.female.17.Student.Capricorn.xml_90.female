The computer virus that attacked her house-mate's computer days ago has seemed to do more damage than the originally thought. The entire harddrive is destroyed and it will take time and money to fix the problem. That means, no Michelle for about another week.  Jackie is still not communicating with anyone that is a contributor to the website. The only person that she has talked to since she has left was her mother. We all know, I am not on speaking terms with that woman either.  Spinner (Abby) is on her way back to Pennsylvania tomorrow. That gives her two more days of catching up with old friends. So you can bet she will not be making many (if any) posts tomorrow. I am unaware of how long the car ride back to Pennsylvania is so she may not be posting for a period of time.  Myself, will be leaving at noon tomorrow. I will be heading out to Williston until Wednesday, and I am not going to be wanting to post at all. I need a vacation from this place so I really don't want to be responcible for anything, including the website.  On another note, our other website went under today. I really didn't have the time to take care of two different websites. I am a busy person you know.  Other than the problems above, the website will be going good. Just think of this week as a vacation for all of the contributors on it. I will probably be making a couple more posts tonight, as well as making some more tomorrow before noon, if I have time.
