I watch the clock,  the hands move like the seasons  and I wait with little patience.  Time is endless, never ending,  I damn Khronos ;  the cause of my pain and torment!  Restlessness overcomes me  and I begin to pace-endlessly.  The wind pushes reality away,  as I continue to yearn for you and I  try to find the key in killing time.  My want for time to pass is excruciating,  Alas, all hope is lost  as a breeze blows in reality and  I give in as my soul cries in agony.  I accept that time is:  immortal,  uncontrollable,  a friend and foe all at once.  One that you cannot kill.
