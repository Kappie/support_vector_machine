There r sum things that evry1 must keep a secret from the world, and like evry1 else i have my secrets. Its more my emotions that i keep secret. It does however cause me 2 stand alone in my darkest hours so 2 speak. Here i am again sinking in2 the dark abyss of nothingness. Have u eva felt that life is just passing u by, that u r living ur life in sum kind of trance, where u r too afraid 2 feel, too afraid 2 take risks, too afraid 2 live? I fell that is happening 2 me. For once in a quite a long time i am questioning who i am, i think i know the answer 2 sum of my problems atm all i need 2 do is be motivated. Sum of my answers may lie in Wicca. Im not going 2 delve very deep in2 wicca. It is sumthing that helped me through hard times in the past and i hope will be able 2 help me again. I always thought i would be strong 2 my belief in wicca but as my life became busier and my passion for dancing increased it has dropped down 2 a lower priority on my list. But as i have been thinking 2day i realise that it was wicca that helped me through the harder times by just doing a little meditation now and then was enough. So ova da next week i will be reading and learning again about it all for my own mental, physical and spiritual well being. Till next time.  Lisa  "Every living thing dies alone."
