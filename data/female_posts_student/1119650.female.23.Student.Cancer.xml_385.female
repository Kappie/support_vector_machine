This means I have also been forced to be subjected to your vile and otherwise rank stench of rotting elephant poop with hay and baby wipes. This also means I've had to endure you're fucking smelly assed Spanish cooking that you bring in and make everyone suffer through. Finally I have to suffer through you making your "business" phone calls ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.   I would just like to offer the following suggestions to you on behalf of everyone in the office who has no balls:  1) Take a fucking shower you reek of dirty uncleansed ass and its really unpleasant for us to have to be around you. Don't you ever notice that cloud of fucking lysol and Yankee candle room spray floating down on you? THAT'S BECAUSE WE CANT FUCKING STAND YOUR VILE ASS, DOUCHEBAG.   2) You might not want to clip your fingernails at your desk cause they fly onto my desk and that is fucking nasty. You don't want to piss me off because I'm contemplating retaliation which involves used tamps. So fucking knock it off.   3)When you're making a personal call, you might want to a) not make them in Spanish, cause its ABUNDANTLY clear that they're not for business, b) shut your fucking mouth when you're on one because I know what you're talking about and its Brazilian soccer matches and you think no one knows what you're talking about and you're fucking SCREAMING in my ear when I'm trying to actually field business calls, you fag, c) if I hear you say "Puta, Doctor" or "oon-bo-leavable" one more time I am gonna come over there and fucking choke you out with the phone cord, you useless piece of shit.   4) When I wear a skirt please refrain from telling me that I look beautiful in it because you're a fucking creep and that's sexual harassment cause you're a skeevy fuck. Its not my fault that you got into a fucking accident and can no longer run batches so leave me out of it.   5) Do yourself a favor and go die 'cause I fuckin' hate you!       Regards,  Gwen  P.S. No, this isn't PMS, I just  really  hate you.
