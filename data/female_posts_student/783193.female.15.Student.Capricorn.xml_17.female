It was pretty fun, but my hands were all grimy afterward, even after I washed them. Then, we went to pizza. You know what THAT means. The best part was when we were doing the competitions when we were bowling, because we were all doing these little individual feuds. Mine was with Christina, who kept beating me by one point! But during the last match, I beat her by, like, five or six. It was only because she kept getting gutter balls in the beginning. Gutter balls sounds like some mutated video game.
