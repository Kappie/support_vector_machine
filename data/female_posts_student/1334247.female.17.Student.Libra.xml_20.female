But, I don't think I was really tired until I got home that night. However, the comedian/magician we had got really old after awhile when he found out someone went to Hooters during a school trip. Then, during the handing out of prizes, he'd ask everyone if they'd been to Hooters, and make other really stupid jokes about it...for almost 15-20 minutes. It got REALLY OLD!!!   The next weekend was Pella and State Music Contest. Pella we got 2nd. It was cold that day, and it wasn't much fun. State all three groups (band and the 2 choirs) got 3's!!! We don't think we really deserved 3's in any groups...actually we thought Varsity Choir should've been a 1 or a high 2. Not a 3!!! Oh well though...I guess there's nothing we can really do about it.   Now this weekend is graduation. The seniors' last day was Thursday, and one of my classes today had 4 people in it, continuing until the end of the year. The other 3 are close friends though, and it's a cool teacher, so we played Hearts (cards)-and I have no idea how to play-so I think I lost...but I had the best excuse you could use. It's kind of sad though having the seniors gone. I really got along with a lot of them.
