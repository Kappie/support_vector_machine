So we will be running around between fields with are chairs and cameras.  Today is cleaning day.  YERK...  I have so little time left before I go in to the hospital.  I am freaking out.  I have long list of things I need and want to do.  I will not be caught off guard like last year.  I have not yet ~ ticked off ~ anything, so I need to move my butt.  I bought myself some walking shoes yesterday and tried them out this morning after taking the girls to the bus.  I still have one foot that is hurting...  but I STILL HAVE TO WALK EVERYDAY.  No excuses.  So off I am to make some calls, pay some bills and clean the house so please have a great friday and........Be Good
