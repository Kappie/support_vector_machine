It's true, I tell you, I was eating a crispy taco even though I actually only like soft taco and suddenly a jolt of pain like none other rocketed up the tiny space between my front teeth and into my skull. Now the gum is swollen, the chip fragment is stuck, and there's a dull ache between my two front teeth that is more aggravating than it is painful. You see folks, it's this kind of shit that will send me to the nut house.  I am always wondering if I will become insane when I get older. They say people like me with high IQs develop multiple personalities in an attempt to distribute their unbelievable intelligence, they say people like me with all this childhood trauma turn out to be murderers who take the lives of others trying to fill an empty space.   there have been times when I think I've teetered on the edge, had that feeling where I am so overwhelmed I seem to lose sense and begin rocking. rocking back and forth aimlessly is something I think I've always done when I'm upset. For some reason it's quite soothing. If you've ever had a hard day, I would suggest a couple hours of this to chill out.   Monday was quite upsetting, and there seems to be a pattern there. I got my GEE, which is the graduate exit exam, back from school. I hate standardized tests, and although I've never done bad on one, they offend me. Well back to the point, I got the GEE back and made mastery, which is good. Mom picked me up from school at 3:30 and I went to guitar, then I walked to the restaurant near my lessons and sat in an empty dining room alone for a few hours while mom and Steven "talked" in the bar type area. Finally at seven we were on our way home with take-out and I remembered to tell her about the test.   when I told her, I lit a fuse, a long fuse. She yelled at me the entire way home. She said I didn't tell her about the test results until now because I was a liar and a manipulator, she said she had let me mother myself for too long and that I had stepped over the line, she said she was going to be a real mother from now on, and that I would be a real kid and not have the freedom I have now. I tried my best to reason with her, but was having trouble because not only would she not shut up, but I was in a state of shock over the absurdity of the matter. I told her that I had simply forgotten about the test, and asked her why she was so upset that I had only not told her for like, 5 hours. I told her that I had not known for a week or a month, I had known about the little fucker test since that morning. She told me that if I couldn't remember something like that then I should get my priorities straight and that I had waited to tell her so I could manipulate her.   as soon as I was in the house, I crashed and burned. I wept over the thought, choked on confusion, and even as I'm writing this it gives me goosebumps. I stayed in the bathroom in the back of the house for a long time. in a fit of anguish I drained half a bottle of my grandmother's prescription cough syrup, and I layed in the bathtub while the medicine knumbed me. I remember my silly wandering thoughts, thinking the empty bathtub was quite comfortable, and smiling at the wallpaper.  once the buzz had worn off I crept into the livingroom and crammed down some spaghetti. I found out that mom had told the entire story to my grandmother and sister, and that they also thought she had lost it. It's one of the few times in my life that Devon has stood up for me, and it was... Well she swaggered out of her bedroom, soaking up the glory of her "defeat" and making some obscure reference to our falling out. I apologized for the second time that night, but what it got me was another screaming fit, with myself on the not-so-cushy receiving end.   again, I  broke down, again, I made a beeline for the bathroom, leaving Olive Garden containers strewn about. This time I didn't stay so long, only long enough to make sure mom was asleep in bed before I left.      the last and final flailing I got occurred the next morning on the way to school. I apologized for the third time and when she still didn't really accept and had a small blow up. at that point, I just gave up. I was so completely inebriated by anger, hers and mine, I couldn't do anything but suck it up and make my way to English class.  I hate not understanding things.
