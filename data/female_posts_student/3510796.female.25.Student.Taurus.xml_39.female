For those of you not in the know, Grey's a huge Cubs fan, I'm  a lifelong Sox fan, and the two teams are renewing the annual interleague rivalry this weekend and next.  Since they started playing interleague games in '97, this is the first time the teams have met with both of them owning winning records.  Both teams are within sniffing distance of first place... and God, the Sox have no pitching.  Starting tomorrow is some guy I think they picked up off of the back of a turnip truck.  I've never heard of him before, ever.  It looks like I'm going to be owing Grey a drink by the end of this weekend.  Speaking of drinks, Erica's send-off was one done in high style.  20 assorted people (co-workers, former workers, and random significant others) ended up making an appearance.  It was like old times, when I first was introduced to the Thursday Night Tradition.  Every Thursday, out we'd go to this hole-in-the-wall Irish pub, at least a dozen of us and oftentimes more.  But people started leaving, and the new people that came in... well, they're fun to be around at work, but so many of them are either married or damn close to it, so they're all about hanging with their life partner, not going out boozing after midnight with the likes of us.  Now we're lucky to field a gang of 6 on a Thursday.  Sad, really.  But hey, maybe this past Thursday is the sort of evening that will remind people how much fun they can have out with us, and maybe it'll lead to future crowds around that long table.  Here's hoping.  Homelife... is strange.  I pull up to the house now, and I get the feeling like there's a giant banner out front that reads "You're Not Welcome Here!"  I mean, this is still my home, technically, isn't it?  And yet I walk around here feeling like a houseguest who has woefully overstayed his welcome.  I want to spend as little time here each day as I have to, and I know feeling like that about one's home can't be good for me.  I can only hope that there will be someplace new I can call home in the very near future.
