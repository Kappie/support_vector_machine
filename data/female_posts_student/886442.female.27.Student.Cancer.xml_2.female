It doesn’t have to be someone or something I’ve never encountered, I even expect that it will be related in some way to something I already have or know about. I think what I’m trying to say is that I need a new mindset, I need a whole new perspective on life. I need to learn how to see things in more than one way. I am at a loss of meaning.   Whatever I do, I keep asking myself  “Ok. Now that you’ve done that, are you any different?” “What has this taught you?” Like everything has to teach me something! But still, I crave for meaning, a higher purpose.  There are two things in life that come with their meanings inherent. One is science and the other is art. What renders them meaningful is that one can profess either one just for its own sake and be completely satisfied by the process rather than the product. There is no end product to either one anyway and all intermediate products come with their meaning inherent as well.   The paradoxical thing here is that art and science have completely different ways of advancing. Science is linear, meaning it is all cause and effect while art moves in leaps, back and forth, in pursuit of the little tidbits of meaning flying in the air and that is how it advances best. But they serve the same purpose which is to explain life, though they may strangely end up complicating it rather than simplifying and do it with such grace that you end up feeling that complication and simplification are one and the same thing. Art and science are also both liberating in the sense that you are free to discover meaning and you are equally free to create your own.   It follows that my being at a loss of meaning must be for lack of intellectual stimulation. I need constantly to feel that I am unfolding each day some small mystery of life that makes for the unfolding of an even greater mystery, the mystery of existence, of creation itself.
