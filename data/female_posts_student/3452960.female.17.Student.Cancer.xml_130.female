I work in the new Freezeways shop in Fore St. I have to work on my own with a bunch of old people who want cheap frozen goods. gah! It was so boring and so hot and I had to tidy and do boring, boring things. I love to rant! Also, my boss is a mixture of David Brent and Wallace from Wallace and Gromit. It cracks me up! so anyway life is boring at the moment. My mobile phone got stolen :-( I can't remember if I told you guys before but I'm SOOOOO annoyed!!! Damn Saltash Community school bastards. I cried - and I NEVER cry! Sorry I'm blabbing, but, shush. There are some really good films coming out which I must see at some point - Shrek 2, Garfield the movie (he rocks ok!!), Spiderman 2 (better be better than the first) and Thunderbirds the movie (come on, you can't say your not a little tempted?) Oh and one final point. I HATE THE BLACK EYED PEAS!!!! ARRRGRRHHGHHHHH! Au revoir
