These memories help us bring back any moments in our lifes. Semantic memory is our memory that tells us what we have learned and what we retain. It helps us learn from our past experiences so we can learn new concepts. This interests me very much. I dont really know where I am going with this but I dont want to remember any of what has happened with all my so called friends in like the past summer. Very bad memories. Well that is enough of the memory stuff for now. later. ~ashley~
