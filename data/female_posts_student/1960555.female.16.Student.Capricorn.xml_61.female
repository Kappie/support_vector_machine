Bitch please, wont someone save me from falling to my knees. (Random ADD moment)  "When you're smiling, oh when you're smiling, the whole world, it smiles with you..."  Then why is it when you're frowing the whole world still smiles?  Some things are just a crock.  How I love it.  It makes things just as jaded as me...  Not that I... no, I am jaded... very much so indeed.  I'm really board.  I have nothing to do tonight.  And I can't do anymore homework right now, I just can't.  I'm sick, A.D.D. and at my breaking point.  Oi vay.    I wanna see a movie... call or email me if you want to see one.  And I could honestly care less when it comes to what movie.  Anything will do at this point.  Save me... Oh and another reason for my rescue, my dad's going out of town on business this Monday til Thursday... Just me and my mum.  We'll either bond or kill each other.  Anyone want to place bets?
