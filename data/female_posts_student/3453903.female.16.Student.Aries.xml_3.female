I don't think I'm like that usually, just so you don't get the wrong impression. I've just been using this for innermost thoughts, and innermost thoughts usually come to me when in a bad mood.   I shouldn't care what complete strangers think about me, really, but I  do  care and so that's the reason I've said this.   Then again, if I wrote my every day thoughts down like I do in LiveJournal then you'd all become terminally bored. Whoever reads this anyway, which I'm guessing isn't many. Gawd that sounded self-pitying, but hey there's not much of a reason to read this unless you know me. And the whole point is for people who know me not to read this.   So yes, just to apologise for the numerous moany entries.
