Christ, Jerm barely knows how down I am... or maybe he does. I talked to Holly for a long time on the phone last night, and we had a great talk, bitching about the various misdeeds and mistakes of Alex. I don't know anyone nearly so self-destructive as that girl, and she's in such intense denial about it all. It seems like she has no concept of how her actions affect other people at all. Oh well. I just need to tell her again that I don't like James, I think she's wasting her life with the son of a bitch, and she really needs to get over her whole "I'm a victim" bullshit. I will not listen to her talk about how poor she is any more. For Christ's sake, she's 20! No one has a ton of money when they're in school, but I suppose she'd have more if she didn't have an old man leeching off her. Okay, enough.  In other news, this weekend's picnic day, and I hope it doesn't rain. Jason is already back and it sounds like he and Lisa are having a "serious discussion." It's kind of a weird time to be a roommate. Jerm's coming tomorrow, and I'm really looking forward to seeing him. I've been really clingy lately with this whole sister thing, and he's finally starting to see that maybe Alex isn't just making a short mistake with her dating choices. I think he now understands and appreciates the family's horror about it all. My mom and baby sister are coming on Saturday, and I'm really looking forward to having them see the campus and my apartment more. They came to Davis last year when Catherine went to sections with her 100M hurdles. Apparently this year she's even faster and doing better than ever. She even knocked my old track rival, Jenny, off the record trophy. I'm glad Catherine's better than that snobby twit. It's also good to be in college and not high school anymore!
