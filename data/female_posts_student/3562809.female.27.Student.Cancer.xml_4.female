Which led me to the grand inspiration of...  Comfort Sushi!  Think of it, there are endless possibilities!  I, for one, would be first in line for a KFC Roll (consisting of fried chicken, mac 'n cheese, maybe a lil slaw or gravy).  It could be wrapped in some sort of biscuit compound (or better yet, cornbread, mmm).  What about a Thanksgiving Roll, with turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, wrapped in a tiny dinner roll?  Pot Roast Roll, with nice tender roast, mashed taters  gravy?     Sure, we love to make sandwiches out of our leftovers, but I'm envisioning the Comfort Sushi as much more sophisticated.  Everything trimmed just so, wrapped nice and snug and precisely sliced up in cute little circles of happiness.   And fresh, too, as sushi oughtta be.  Aren't you craving it?  No?!  Shoot, let me pick up a sushi-making kti  a bucket meal from KFC.  I'll figure out the details  give you a ring when it's ready.
