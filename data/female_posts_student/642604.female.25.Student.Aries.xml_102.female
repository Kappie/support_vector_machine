Day 1  Friday night I left work and drove immediately to meet Caitlin and Eric so that Nancy could drive us to Union Station.  Packing for this thing was a nightmare because we didn't know what we needed to bring.  We had sleeping bags, blankets, water, food, clothes, chairs, pillows and bags of stuff to entertain us.  You see the only thing we knew going into this was that we were to start lining up on Saturday at noon and all would be turned away after that.  We didn't know if we would be allowed to leave the camp site once we received this mystical "wristband" the website kept talking about.  We were also given a list of rules stating that if this wristband was tampered with at all we would turned away or cut immediately. The rules also said if you were to get in line before noon on Saturday you would automatically turned away and cut.  So we managed to carry EVERYTHING onto the train and store it.  We sat separately since there was not a spare seat on this Friday night train to NYC.  Once there we emerged from Penn Station New York and up onto the street.  There we took in another cigarette and decided to catch a cab since we had no idea where we were going.  Once we loaded everything into the cab I told the driver to take us to the Chelsea Star.  Well when the cab driver pulled up in front of the Chelsea Hotel I explained this was not it.  I dug in my bag for the address and finally he delivered us to the correct address.  Let me explain what I saw.  There was a blue door with the address number on it.  That was it.  It was just a blue door.  We were thinking maybe it would be better to just sleep on the streetsâ€¦ but alas we called up on the intercom, lugged our stuff up a large flight of stairs, as there was no elevator, and we ended up being pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere.  It was a hip â€œloftâ€� sort of feel.  At first the manager scared us by saying things had been screwed up in the blackout the weekend before and they were full but then he explained he had a room for usâ€¦ I still donâ€™t understand why he felt the need to tell us they were full unless they were trying to say how lucky we were.  So we went up another flight of stairs to the room where it was even cuter.  I was very impressed and the feel of the room was very stylish and very roomy.  I would highly recommend it in the end.  So anyway, we went out to the terrace (you canâ€™t smoke inside NYC buildings anymore unless itâ€™s your own place) and had a couple cigarettes before the terrace closed and then Caitlin and Eric went looking for cold water.  The air in our room hadnâ€™t been turned on until we got there so it was burning up.  I, on the other hand, went up to the room and waited for them.  When they finally returned later they mentioned they had walked around the block to see what was there and guess what?  Penn Station was across the street.  We took a $7 cab ride for nothing!  So we went to sleep that night with a game plan for the following day.  Day 2  At 9 we all woke up and began taking turns in the shower.  Well the shower head was adjustable by height but it wouldnâ€™t stay up high so we learned how flexible we could be. And believe it or not I broke the damn thing at one point, which actually made it easier for me to use but then Eric fixed itâ€¦ dammit.  We walked to get breakfast, only bringing a bag of water and snacks and chairs with us this time.  We had a good breakfast and we headed down to the Jacob Javits Center to see what was going on.  The rules said no one could start lining up till noon so we figured we would be waiting across the street and in a mad dash we would all be running across the street to line up.  But when we got there we found out that the whole line had started the night before.  Technically the street where you originally lined up wasnâ€™t on the property so it didnâ€™t count.  We got in line behind what must have already been almost three thousand people.  We immediately began to meet people.  Adrienne â€“ from PA, a single mom at the age of 21.  Jen and Tiffany â€“ friends from PA, Tiffany worked a hourly job (I didnâ€™t much care for her) and Jen who was recently married and had two kids.  Erica and her dad â€“ Erica was a drop dead gorgeous 17 year old who had missed the L.A. auditions and was in from San Diego.  Her dad had taken a job in Boston and had moved from the family.  She had been out doing college searches and her dad agreed to come with her to the auditions.  Fatima â€“ from NJ.  Stephan (which he pronounces Stefan â€“ or Steph-on) Jones who is a model for Ford Models.  Look up the website if you want to know what he looks like.  He lives right across the state line in Jersey and was hysterical.  â€œTO THE WINDOW!!! TO THE WALL!!!â€�  So we wait in this line for what must have been close to three and a half hours.  I got sunburned big time.  We finally get in, set up camp and relax.  OH!  And while we were in line we heard a rumor that once in with a wristband we couldnâ€™t leave.  So we sent Eric scrambling for things we needed.  He had to drag back a suitcase and a huge bag.  I felt so bad.  Once he left to go get it we spoke to someone who had already set up camp, received a wristband and had come out and she said you could come and go as long as the people around you would let you back in line.  We knew this wouldnâ€™t be a problem since we had already established a friendship with them.  We tried to call him to tell him that he didnâ€™t need to get our stuff but he had left his phone off.  So he lugs it back and we take it all into the parking lot, get our wristbands and get in.  We sit around and Caitlin and Eric go get lunch/dinner.  They come back, we hang out a lot more, and it starts.  Everyone begins singing at the top of their lungs everywhere for everyone and especially around those of us who donâ€™t care.  Finally Eric goes back to the hotel and Caitlin and I decide to go to sleep.  Mind you, itâ€™s quiet hours according to the American Idol staff but the news crews are still running around and so everyone is singing for them.  Plus on top of that before quiet hours, this one girl starts up this disco line thing and itâ€™s in the main aisle way so the only way to get through is to dance down it or they wonâ€™t let you through.  It was hysterical.  So getting back to when Caitlin and I tried to go to sleep.  We are on hard concrete and we canâ€™t fall asleep and it was just killing me.  But we finally fall asleep.  Day 3  We wake up to singing, of course, and we are told we will probably be moving to camp inside so they can open up more room in the parking lot for the new arrivals.  So for a while we wait around Eric brings us doughnuts when he comes back to the camp site.  I finally tell them to move stuff without me if they move us inside and I head back to the hotel for a shower.  When I come back I am in a much better mood and Caitlin goes back to the hotel.  We sit around a lot, Caitlin and Eric had gone to K-Mart the day before and had picked up this pole thing so we rig up a tent.  They go get lunch.  We eat.  The day is boring.  I finish my entire Rolling Stone Magazine.  Eric and I take a trip to K-Mart later to pick up foam padding to sleep on that night and better pillows.  When we get back Caitlin tells us they just gave an announcement that they would be waking us up at 4 AM.  This sucks since I have to do my hair with a curling iron or it will look like crap.  So we decide I will be getting up at 3:30 to go back to the hotel.  We go get dinner.  We get back and sit for a while.  Then Erica says she is going to sleep at the hotel with her dad and Caitlin tells me I have to do the same, that she will not accept anything else.  So I pack up as much as I can to get back to the hotel and go sleep there.  In the midst of the day, by the way, I am getting phone calls from family and friends asking whatâ€™s going on.  I say nothing, they donâ€™t believe me, Iâ€™m like would you like me to tell you what I read about in Rolling Stone because thatâ€™s the most excitement Iâ€™ve had all day.  So I get back to the hotel, go to sleep.  And I am using Caitlinâ€™s cell phone alarm since hers is louder than mine.  I wake up at one when I think the alarm is going off and I am cursing the world cause I am thinking itâ€™s the alarm.  Eric wakes up and is telling me it is not at all 3:30 and he has to get up to find out what time it is.  Itâ€™s only 1.  Good thing it was her stalker or I wouldâ€™ve given her a piece of my mind.  But she couldnâ€™t help that.  Then I wake up later cause I am cold and wake Eric up again to get the blanket.  More to come about Audition Day soonâ€¦.
