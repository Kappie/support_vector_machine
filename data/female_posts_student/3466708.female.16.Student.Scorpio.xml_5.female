Like..sure there's a lot of shit going on in the world and a lot of people have it really rough but I am thankful for everything that I have..or don't have..I dunno. I'm just thankful. And life IS beautiful guys, honestly it is. Sometimes the view just gets a bit blurry is all.  Anyways. That was random. lol So'z. Umm yeah so today..I had school. Only 3 more days left! Yay 'cuz I'm so ready for summer break to start. I still have exams though..bleh. OH well. My sister had gymnastics today so I went with my sisters and my mom into town for that and we shopped. I bought a candle holder and these lil candles that are buttermilk vanilla and scented and oh baby do they ever smell good. Indeed. I'm a fan of the scents, I must say. And then..we went out to dinner at a greek/italian restaurant which was pretty good, I've had better though. =P Now it's just us gals at home and I picked out a ballet movie to watch since my dad ain't home lol I figured this was a good time. I've never been in dance but I do enjoy watching it a lot..it's the girly girl part of me I guess. Who knows. It's called The Company by the way..I'll let'cha know if it's half decent or whatever. Damn I was going to make this a really short entry and now it's getting long. I can never give a simple answer to something. I realized that today. I deffiantly analyze things a lot but mostly, I figure that's not bad. I like to learn. I'm not ignorant. So..that's good right? lol Anyways..some person that I dont know *shrug* subscribed to my xanga and their entry had this survey and so I'm gonna fill it out because..well that was all I was gonna do but then I started yabbering on about who knows what.

I SEARCH> for music a lot..always dl shtuff. BAD SOPHIE, BAD! mwuah ha. I WONDER> what's it's like being dead. (I started thinking about that yesterday like just natually out of curiousity but then realized it's a waste of time because who really knows? Not moi.) I REGRET> umm..ordering lassagna for dinner because it was a bit of a disappointment..shoulda gone for the ravioli. :D  I LOVE> my family, friends, my country, music, laughing, sunsets, beaches..I could go on  I ACHE> in my head sometimes..I'm not sure why.
