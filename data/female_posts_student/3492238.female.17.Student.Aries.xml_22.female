Ball hit between 1st and 2nd - 1st stayson first, 2nd gets the grounder, short covers for the tag out on 2nd. This is how it should have worked. I was covering 2nd, ready for the throw, when the left fielder had actually run in to 2nd, to also get the ball, which made everyone look ridiculous. Agggghhhhh. Why don't they know what they're doing? I also don't understand why SH and DB put CS back in to pitch for another 2 innings. I mean, at least put SS back in. When yu pitch like that for 3 innings you have to do something about it. I mean, if yu're not going to let me pitch, then thats fine. But you have to prove to yourself that you're good enough to be put back in, something CS didn't do. I work my butt off for nothing, or so it seems. We have another practice on Sunday. I hate knowing it's going to be very frustrating only there's nothing I can do to prevent it, just go.   Uninvited. Can I say anything? No. Because you invited yourself. You wonder why I can't and don't talk to you. This is why. I just can't. There'd be no point. I'm not putting myslef up for a huge blow out. I don't want that. But then I also can't pretend everything is fine forver. I tried that one. Didn't pan out so much. The one day I'll have in 2 weeks to actually talk to MI about anything, and it's already gone before it comes. I don't think anyone quite understands. Invited yourself. But I can't stop you. You can stop me. I make the plans, and you take them away.
