Ok so first off i woke up at 6:21 like always. Then I took a shower. Once again i almost feel asleep during it b/c i was so darn tired. Then i got dressed ate breakfast and did my hair and makeup (which i'm sure you all needed to no). Then i went to school. I walked into the band hall and like no one was there. It was the weirdest thing. I mean no chairs (expect for jazz stuff) and maybe like 10 ppl tops. So yea then i went to my locker and got my books and then:  1st period- Spanish w/ Wilkinson. So i walked in didn't no a sole. but i sat behind this girl who i learned was in band. But when wilkinson started class the only thing i caught was hola! Not kidding so much spanish so fast agh! Anywho so i sat behind Lindsey and i also learned that she had Mr. Kovacs next so i told her the beheading story and she went to 2nd period and told him that so now many fishes know that i plan on beheading Mr. Kovacs. but anywho then we did some work sorta and then ring ring bell  2nd period- Biology w/ Melton. "I'm Mrs. Melton. If it doesn't say that on your schedule your in the wrong class. And, those horror stories that you've heard about me there true." Not kidding first 3 sentences out of her mouth! I'M SCARED!!!!!!!!!!! But yea, Britney is in my class so we sat next to each other fun stuff. But, our class is not very good. anywho nothing happened so ring ring bell  3rd and 4th- Block math class w/ Pye. That class rocks. Not nesscarily b/c its math but b/c of the ppl in my class! Megan, Melissa, Grace, Jerry, Britney, and many more who just aren't coming to my mind. We ran through rules then some notes during 3rd, and in 4th we did that computer thing Geometer w/e its called i really don't no but it was fun to mess w/.  Lunch- yea so i have C lunch which i don't really like b/c i liked going from lunch to band but w/e i can't change that. So w/e all the ppl from math are in my lunch so its fun and Toni has  C lunch to so she WILL eat lunch w/ us!!!!!!!!  5th- band w/ mac. So yea we suck! not kidding the first day was terrible b/c everyone was not playing and messing around and some ppl were playing way to loud and some not even. We kinda suck at the Opener. But i love the marching part but inside when some ppl who suck play or those who just don't play is starting to make me mad.  6th-  Geo. Honors w/ Lange. Yea i heard that she was bad, hates skinny ppl or w/e but i personaily like her. We listened to songs about countries and then had to find them on the map. In my class theirs Kylene, Leslie, Jennifer, Porsha and i think thats it that count from my view.  7th- English Honors w/ lindner. OMG he is so funny! I am going to love that class. Not many ppl are in it, um stacy, cassie sarah hadden. And a lot of the boys from my last year english class so oh no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  the ice cream social- WOW fun stuff! I ate ice cream then i was really hyper. So, i ran around a bunch. And, then helped my mom clean up. Oh and i found out why ppl hate the fishes so much b/c they are kinda stupid. Um yea so that was pretty much my first day of school!!  But today nuttin much happened. Oh we wore our Poipu-pee shirts and a lot of ppl asked about them but i think their funny. I had homework. And, toni had a huge "katie moment". It was really funny. I got my band bag back so Mickey i know longer have my "team cologate" bag which i left at school by accident.  SO i think this is long enough. later yall
