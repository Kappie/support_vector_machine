Sum up of a truly marvelous 24 hrs. Firstly I got good marks on both my tests yesterday so I was very pleased. I got an extension...then again as did we all, on the maths coursework, which I think we all can agree is a welcome releif to say the least. Then I stayed after school with Jess, and we rehearsed and wrote our script. It was fun!!! I am now a wierd Italian person who is the daughter of Sammy who happens to be frm norfolk! Then we went to see Shrek two, which is just good! Esp. as it was at Bury cinema, which is one of my fav places. Then we went to Sam's and 'helped' babysit. Actually we ate doughnuts and played bargin hunt the board game..which is good, despite the fact I don't really like board games that much, as I never really have anyone to play them with. Then we went home and ate then went to bed. Anyway we got up Jess went home, while I was at the Hairdressers. By the way even if I do say so myself my hair is great!!!! It's sounds really vain but it is! I haven't stopped flicking it all day. Which brings me to my next point. Me, mum, grandma and grandad went to the Trafford centre. and I got wolf whistled, now I have been before, but never when I was wearing just Jeans and a jumper, me not the blonde, because the guy winked at me when I turned around...safe to say I think I went bright red! I was with my grandad after all. Then we ate in food from the bottom orient in these new tables we found at the back of the orient upstairs that no one ever goes to, so it's really quiet..which was good coz there was no tables anywhere else. ANYWAY, then we shopped round, bought the above. I tried on this really nice skirt, but then found out I couldn't afford it (but by then nothing could get me down :)). It was really cute, denim with like a chain on it, that was like a charm bracelet with little pink beads and faires and little metal baubles with flowers on hanging of it. It was sooo nice. Anyway! This brings me to now where I have just watched Emma...again! Aww it's so cute, I cried even more at the film than I did at the book. Such wonderful actors! Then again Ewan Mcgregor is in it! I really must stop watching such soppy films, they always make me either cry or at the very least my eyes water. Oh! I love them anyway...they're just sooo good!  All for now,  from one very happy, Dani
