I nearly broke down crying.  This afternoon I met a little girl about the same age as the one in my arms. She was smart, active, and loved to laugh just like any other child in the world.  Except half her face had been burnt off.  She was a little hispanc girl that had been abandoned by her mother. The family that was taking care of her now was working on adopting her.It was so hard to smile and be happy without remorse.I'd think of what she must have gone through at such a young age and what might happen in the future. Then the most heart aching part was that when she called me "mommy". She probably assumed i held the role since i am hispanic my self and my hair is quite dark probably much like her mothers. She was also infatuated with hair, not that i blame her considering she can never grow her own naturally. I'm wondering why i'm not crying now. I guess i've always found refuge in Rev 21:3-5.  "With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say 'Look! The tent of God is with mankind,and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from thier eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.' And the one seated ont he throne said 'Look! I am making all things new' Also he sais:'Write because these words are faithful and true.'"  I hope I live to see that. Until then i think you should know she is one of the most beautiful children i've ever had the chance to meet.   good night.
