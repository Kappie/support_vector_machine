Then I drove back to the places and delivered them. The first place was subway, and the lady took it and said she'd call me, so far so good. Then I went to this place in downtown, and they told me that I had to be 18. Ok, not so good.  My mom suggested Burgerville, there were two in our area, so I was like "Ah okay!" and we drove to one on Mill Plain blvd. I was filling out the form and the pen quit working. So naturally, I started scribbling vigorously on the paper, and I rippled it. The lady gave me a tape dispenser and i tried to tear the tape but flung the whole thing onto a nearby table, where it knocked over and elderly man's fries. *oops* So I finally turned it in. After watching the episode, my mom suggested we try the other Burgerville, maybe they would hire me if this one wouldn't. (We know they wont.) So we drove to Fourth Plain blvd. I went in and got the form and filled it out in the car, for safety measures. Then I went back in, and tripped over practically nothing. Everyone stared at me, as I dusted myself off. Trying to be all cool about it, I strided on over to tht counter and gave the paper to the lady. She told me I forgot to sign it, so i did, except.. well I forgot my name for a second and sort of just scribbled. The lady took it anyway (probably put ti in the paper shredder).    An overview:   Mill Plain:  Thinks I am a violent, fry killing, paper ripping, tape thrower.What place wants that? The Italian Mafia?  Fourth Plain:  Thinks I am a retard that cant spell her name and trips over ghosts. Maybe I could be a Goodwill Ghostbuster.   *sigh*  Just when i thought I was going to get a job and buy a car, so I could get myself around, I set aside a special time to embarass myself in public. Ah the fun of it. One of these days I swear I will get a job, if I have to tear apart Portland, and Vancouver!
