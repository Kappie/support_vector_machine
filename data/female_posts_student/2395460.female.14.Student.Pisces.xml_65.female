But if you did, say, want to carry your Treo with you while you white water raft, the  urlLink Aqua Pruff Accessory Bag  is something you'll want. These neoprene (synthetic foam rubber) bags are waterproof, sand-resistant, and they float. Now if you have to dive into rough waters to rescue your valuables, you'll have a fighting chance.
