So I am very happy about that because it's didn't dramatically drop.  I worked my ass off trying to understand everything for Bio and I tried my very best.  71% is the best I can do.  I put my very best effort forth.  Mat and I went to the zoo today.  Our lunch was like the most expensive thing ever!  Tonight I am going to the Greek Festival with Megz and a bunch of my other friends.  It should be fun.  I also am eating what I want to eat now.  I mean I don't want to admit it, but I am obsessed with weight, and weighing myself.  I decided I need to get out of the habit, even if that means I gain a couple pounds (but hopefully that won't happen) Anyways....today has been great!!  My Bio marks just made my day.  I swear she like rigged the marks cause I thought I did bad.  Maybe my T.A. is right after all.  Maybe I am just like way too hard on myself.  I mean I do expect great things from myself though, I mean there is no doubt about that!  I also wrote this little thing a while ago.  Just about people who inspire me, I look up to, and mean a lot to me:      Making a Difference    Everywhere I go it seems that the message trying to be conveyed to students is that there T.A. is someone who they can rely on, find strength in, and just go to in times of need.  Truly that is what my T.A. is there for and she has been such an amazing support and guide through out my high school years.  However, at the beginning of grade ten my T.A. was away for the first few months.  To count the various substitutes I had gone through is nearly impossible, nor did I feel very comfortable is a new school environment.  There was this one day after tutorial had ended, and our substitute we had for T.A. had asked us to get a card initialed proving we had gone to tutorial.  It was my Science teacher, Mrs. Jagorinec who asked me who my T.A. was.  When I thought about this question, my answer came out as I don’t know.  That was the truth.  I had met so many different people in the following weeks that the names of people became unimportant to me.  Once my Science teacher realized that really I didn’t have a defined T.A. or just someone to talk and rely on, she did her best to make me feel welcome within the school community.  She talked to me, took interest in what I liked, and most importantly she cared.  To her I was more that just the student that sat in the back corner.  I was more than just another student in her Science class.  As the weeks proceeded, Mrs. Jagorinec began to notice my involvement in the school community and the different aspects of extra-curricular activities I took interest in.  These interests of mine became our foundation for weekly discussions.  The more she took interest and the more we communicated, I began to feel more welcome in the school community.  It wasn’t long before I felt that she too was someone I could rely.  I discovered she was a teacher I could turn to for advice, someone that would support me in tough times, and just talk when no one else was around.  A couple months later my T.A. came back permanently and I learned that she was also an amazing person.  She was there to support me with learning and help me with choices, but I wouldn’t take back the way Mrs. Jagorinec had made me feel in the past months.  She helped me to get through those months where I didn’t have a supportive relationship with any other teacher, and didn’t have any one else besides my friends to turn to.  Soon enough she became my favourite teacher and her Science class was also the place I loved to be most.  Not only was she an inspiration, but she was also a role model to me as well.   Since I got to know Mrs. Jagorinec very well in the last months, I began to feel more open when I needed to ask for help.  I didn’t feel pressure to always be perfect in her class and she reminded me that making mistakes was an important step in the learning process.  At the end of grade ten she had mad such an impact on me that I realized I wanted to teach Science.  I thought I may possibly want to teach Biology because I excelled in that area more so than others.  When I reached grade eleven she only had the opportunity to teach one Biology class.  During the second semester I saw her in the hallway and she told me that I was in her Biology class.  I wondered how this could be; because on my original schedule I was suppose to have a different teacher.  It turned out that one Biology class had been switched from another teacher to her, so she had the opportunity to teach me for the second year in a row.    I cannot describe the difference she has made.  Times when she saw me in the hallways and just asked how things we going had value and importance to me.  Just a simple question of how’s it going can make all the difference in whether my day was good or bad, just because she took time to care.  Even when I wasn’t a student in her class, I was an important friend outside of class.  She has inspired me to become a Biology teacher in the future.  I plan to go to University and study Biological Sciences and then obtain my teaching degree to teach secondary education.  Before I had met Mrs. Jagorinec teaching was only a dream, but she has made me realize that becoming a teacher is only a goal away.    This is a poem I wrote about her, because of the difference she has made in my life, and I am certain that she will continue to inspire and touch others students such as myself in the near future.      Thank You  People come and people go But you were so special I want you to know I’ve never met anyone so kind and so caring So different, all that knowledge you were sharing  I still remember one day walking by You gave me a smile instead of a “hi” That feeling inside was something so great A gift that anyone could appreciate  You never failed to ask how things were going Never failed at the compassion you were showing Always proved you wanted to help out Certainly the greatest teacher without a doubt  There is just something special about you You know what to say and you know what to do You helped me with Science and with Biology too Helped me to deal, helped me to get through  A memory of you will remain in my heart Didn’t think you would be so cool right from the start But wonderful people they come and they go The thing in life is that we never really know  So here is a thank-you to all that you have done You have made such an impact on everyone You are an inspiration and a role model too There is nothing about you that I would undo  Thank you     	My high school years have been filled with wonderful memories of the remarkable experiences and the many magnificent people.  With anticipation this wonderful precedent has be set for the generations to come.  Just thought I would write a little essay kinda thing.  Just felt like it you know.  It gives me more time to reflect on everything.
