Thats why all those fucking ppl at school make me sick. daniel? shes had like what? 4 boyfreinds this year...whats the point. there are only a select few out there that you can be with. and when you do meet them you know that they have something that just fits. Friends fit in a different way. and its too often confused. i mean i dont believe there is only one person on the earth for you. honestly there are probable thousands upon thousands. b.c. that's their personality and who they are. but that will come across your path? a few. you have many chances to be happy. and it might end. it might now. but why do ppl seem to feel the more guys your seen with the happier you'll be. it takes the wonderment out of it. it takes the faith out of it. it takes everything and throws it down the shithole. b.c. they have a public image that fills the void of their life. just fuck off would you.   this is how i see it as its supposed to be: lyrics ( of course b.c. there is nothing in real life anymore)  Who makes you feel the way that I make you feel Who loves you and  knows   you the way I do Who touches you and holds you quite like I do Who makes you feel like I make you feel
