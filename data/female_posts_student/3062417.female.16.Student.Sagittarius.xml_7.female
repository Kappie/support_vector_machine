And then it was on to my US History. But then I realized I didn't bring the book home. Oh DARN. lol. So that's why I'm online now. To look up the stuff for history. Fun funness huh? Yea not really. Well I probally won't be on tomorrow cause it's gonna be a busy day. Here is what's happening tomorrow: 1. School 2. Homework as soon as I get home from school (maybe online??) 3. Jazz Band from 7-8:30 4. Get home around 9 and watch 1 hour of TV while doing more homework before I finally go to bed. And then I get to do that all again Tuesday cause the cabaret is friday and saturday (come watch us suck everyone!!!)  Well I'm off. G'nite to everyone. Lots 'o lovin', Kelly
