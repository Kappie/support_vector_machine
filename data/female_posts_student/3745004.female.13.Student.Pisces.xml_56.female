And because it amuses me, I shall relate to you the (mis)adventures of Bekka and the Super Nintendo.  So anyway, this level is the last one of the Stage Clear mode, where you beat levels one by one as they get progressively faster. Not hard, really. Well, that is, the levels leading >up  So, right, I'm all hyped up for the last level. And then it comes... BOWSER!! Roooar. The flatulent King of the Koopas himself. -_- So, by now I'm thinkin' it'll be a breeze. (No pun intended) Then comes the chiller.. "BWAHAHA! IF YOU DO NOT KNOW CHAINS AND COMBOS YOU ARE WASTING BOTH OF OUR TIMES!" -_-;;; Isn't that dandy? He's got "health" and I have to use these "chains and combos" to "attack" him.  Well, it still doesn't seem  too  hard. I mean, chains and combos are easy, y'know? So I'm thinking "Hah. My power of justice shall smite thee, yon toady-beast." You know, just cos it was easy to win the other levels. So Bowser laughs maniacally, the game starts...  Game over.   Game over ! I mean, the speed level was only 50, I had gone up to 100 before. So I hit the 'try again' button.  Bowser laughs evilly. The colums of blocks start to rise again.   Game over!!!!  -_- So, I try again.  Same thing. Mwahahaha. Game starts. Game over. This goes on for a while, by now every time I lose I lapsed into Ed-mode. Screech unintelligible words, flail for a few seconds, angrily mash the button to try again. And every so often I'd get a comment from Boy, "Deep breaths," or "Calm down." At which I would either pretend to hyperventilate or screech at him. I mean, I was getting killed by a  turtle on steroids !! I had a right to be torked.  'cos, I mean, I'd like get him way past half health then the stupid speed level would increase. And increase.. and..  I think I eventually started saying some rather unsavory things about Bowser's mother. Or at least I would have, but my mother was sleeping and wished to remain as such. So I just shook my fist at the tv. Repeatedly.  And it went on like this for, uh.. 45 minutes? I'm sort of embarrassed to say that XD but it's true.  Mwahaha. Game starts. Game over. Screech. Flail. Try again.  Then finally I got a 4 chain and whipped Bowser's scaly tush. And lemme tell you, four chains are HARD. It's like, the set-up has to be PERFECT or you have to be pretty damn lucky. So I'm thinking,  What do I win, what did I unlock?  Cos after that you damn well WANT to win something or unlock a new character or  something.   ...I got the ultimate privilege of watching the credits...  *screech, flail*
