It sounds like unless I have an unknown crime in my past (which I may... read previous post) I'll get to work there, but I'll have to go through some training before I can work there regularly.  And I'll need to buy professional liability insurance for post-partum care givers.  So, we'll see.  My aunt is also trying to get me a job at her hospital doing medical coding.  Boring, but comes with a paycheck.  So, who knows?  My aunt just got home and her dog is so excited!  Ummm.. that's about all I've got for now.
