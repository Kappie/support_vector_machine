Ok, this feeling of vulnerability is a new thing to me. I'm used to being in control, I'm used to having the upper hand. This is not something I've had to deal with before. I don't know what to do. Do I tell him? I want to. But part of me doesn't so I'm thinking I should hold off until all of me does. Last time I didn't listen to my heart I got thrown to the ground so hard it's not even funny. So yes, intuition wins this time.
