AT ALL. it's not like i can vote anyway...although even if it does turn out that i am for nader, i will still help out kerry. this is because, not including politics and other actually important factors, we share the same birthday and his last name is my brother's middle name.  hey look at how i have babbled! if you actually read all this i am so very proud of you, and also wondering why you are so crazy to do such a thing. oh well..   p.s. i was watching colonial house today(i dont have cable*screams*) and the english guy named dominic is really hot...just so you know.
