Do you ever find yourself thinking about someone? I do. I'll be thinking about someone then I'll feel stalker-like and stop. It's scary sometimes. Not a guy or someting, just like a friend you don't talk to anymore. Like..I sometimes am like:Man, haven't talked to Sophia in awhile..  I have Lisa Loeb stuck in my head, and the scary part is..I DON'T LISTEN TO HER! weird..  I'm out for now.
