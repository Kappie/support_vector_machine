SO Mel had this wonderful idea that we should go to Pulse at CCC. So we went. And mi god it was sooo bad! First, we came and we got lost! Because this place is sooo massive! We ended up finding Rory and he told us where it was. So we walk downstairs into this room and the first thing I think is, "Mi God it's like a nightclub" And it sure was. It felt like I was in this illegal, underground rave party place. The music was sooo loud, and the sound system was pretty awesome. It was sooo big though. This place is so rich! There was all this modern cool artwork on the walls, and these little red poof chairs, with mini table at knee height with candles on it. There was this bar, and a stage with a DJ on it and surround by the MASSIVE sound system. Then there were pool tables, and a screen with random videoson it, with like bunnys and stuff killing each otha. And the back door was open so people kept on coming in, lots of people. Seriously all this stuff is like nuthing our church could ever afford. Not that I even want it! I totally missed St.Steves, with it's good 'ol green carpet and EBN's simple laser lights. And everyone was soooo dressed up as well. This place didn't have a good vibe 'bout it. We looked 'round 4 people we knew but we couldn't see ne1 so we were totally lonered. We ended up sitting down, wondering wether it would start. But the strange thing was it never did. It was jsut music all the time. It was total boredom torture. I started 2 feel sick so we went out of the room and sat in a hallway talkin. Wetried 2 prank Mel's Dad so he would pick us up, but I didn't know my fone was a private number (I've changed it now!) Then we tried 2 prank Luke, and we ended up messaging him 2 tell him 2 call me. He wouldn't come and save us which was a shame. But we talked 4 abit. Mel tried 2 get him 2 come by saying things like- "If you love her, which you do, you will come!" and "There are heaps of hot guys here and they are all coming up to Beth and she is very tempted" It didn't work. He just laughed. haha. So we ended up running into this seminar room and watching TV. How sad of us. And we found lollipops in the kindergarten cupboard and we ate them. How mean of us. We ended up going home around 10. But it was soooooo bad! When we got bak 2 Mel's house we watched home videos (hehe, i saw u as a 1 as a 10-yr old Luke! U look sooo different! Mwhahahah....) and the Castle. I left her house at bout 1pm. We only woke up at 12.00 midday because we didn't get 2 sleep 'till 2am! Argh. So tired. And thenBec Bainescame over 4 dinner. We had baked dinner. :D Yum! We had a nice chat in mi room, and we did those little matchmaking quizzes where u add all the letters in ur name and do all this random stuff. Hehe, Luke and I got 97% compatability and Bec and Luke got 17%! Hehe. Jsut 2 give you an example. We did more people obvously. Mwhahaha. So that was basically mi day. How tiring. Im tired. Nitey Nite.
