NOOOOOOOOO my CAAAAARRRR!!!... Well.. I guess I don't really need it cause this weekend is Erinn's b-day party which will take up pretty much all of Saturday and most of Sunday.. but... I hope I can still go see Donnie Darko with Ryan on Friday, if we're even doing that, I don't know!  Today was the Seniors' last day. I AM AN HONORARY SENIOR. Me and Erinn ate lunch in the Senior Lounge today, lol we rock. It was like enemy grounds. Kinda. Anyways. I get to leave school at ONE everyday til school ends! Because there are only 5 people in Journalism now, and obviously there's no more newspapers, so we just getta leave! I got a note from my mommy and everthing!!! Heh. Yay I get to go sleep. Or.. I dunno. But next week, whenever sixth period finals are, probably Friday, I'll get to cut out TWO HOURS early!!! YAY. Wow school's almost over. HOLY CRAP I'm excited! BEST SUMMER EVER Somebody call me, I'm bored! Borrrrrrrrrreduh.
