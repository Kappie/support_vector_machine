Well, after 20 years the wife felt this was ridiculous.  She figured she would break him of this crazy habit.    So one night, while they were in the middle of a wild, screaming, romantic session, she turned on the lights.  She looked down.  And saw her husband was holding a battery operated pleasure device...  a vibrator ...  soft, wonderful and larger than a real one.  She goes completely ballistic.   "You impotent bastard," she screamed at him, "How could you be lying to me all of these years?  You better explain yourself!" The husband looks her straight in the eyes and says calmly: "I'll explain the toy...  if you explain the kids."   I thought that this was one funny shit. Hey guys, if you are not satisfied with something, don't fake it. DO SOMETHING!!!
