Then I watched my dad try to put these chairs together that he bought my mom for Mother's Day, but it turns out that one of them, a piece for it was like snapped in half. So, after he was done shitting his pants with anger, he and I went down to Canadian Tire to exchange the chair, which took  forever  because the people at Canadian Tire have the mind capacity of a stick. Honestly. My dog is smarter than them. Anyways, and then after that we decided to go look at cell phones. So we did that for about an hour, then we went home. I decided against the Samsung one, because I phoned Braun with one of the ones they had there, and they're too small and too hard to talk with. So, no. Then we went out for supper at Montana's. Yeeep.  Okay, now for the interesting story. Actually, I just realized I have another story after this one. Hrm. Okay, so we're out at Montana's. We wait for about 20 minutes, get a table, order our food and eat it. (It gets better) So we figure the bill's going to be at least $65, right? (Probably more) So the idiot that was our waitress, gives us the bill. Look at the grand total....$32. So my dad looks at the bill and he's like "This  definatly  isn't our bill. But, it's their mistake, so I'll pay this one. It's a hell of a deal anyway." (The bill actually belonged to the table  beside  us, this Chinese couple, but I have a story about them in the next paragraph). So my mother, Tyler, and I go to the car to wait for my dad. So, my dad evidently paid the Chinese couple's bill as our own. So he walks non-chalant out of the restaurant then fucking books it to the car. "GO GO DRIVE!" he says. Apparently the people at Montana's were starting to catch on. Especially the Chinese couple. I just think that's hilarious. We paid, like, at least half of what the meal itself was worth.  Okay, so this Chinese couple. Now, I know that Chinese people have a reputation of eating an insane amount of food in one sitting, but MY. FUCKING. GOD. This story is about the girl in particular. She's the tiniest person in the world. She had this double chicken dinner thing. There was. So much chicken in this thing. I couldn't believe it. I thought she wasn't going to finish half of this dinner. No, no. She eats the whole fucking plate. THEN, for dessert, she has this 6 or 7 inch tall cake. Oreos, peanut butter, mocha...mmm, calories, is all I can say. This thing was HUGE. She ate almost the whole thing. WHERE THE HELL IT ALL WENT I HAVE NO IDEA. But, yeah, I don't know what else to rant about, so, I bid you adieu.   -Joebie
