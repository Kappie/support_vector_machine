A place where I kiss ass six hours a day, to get the grades to go to some college, so I can get some job, so I can pay the government one third of everything I make, so they can keep the vicious cycle going. Controlling everyone and everything, so this is the only kind of life to lead in order to survive. A life so unrecognizably, carefully planned, so that the only thing left to honestly worry about is what color socks we're wearing tomorrow (I prefer white). Sounds like a plan. I love it. Don't ask me why.
