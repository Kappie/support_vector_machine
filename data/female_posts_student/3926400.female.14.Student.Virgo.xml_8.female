I survived a weekend trip with my mother (Jessie couldn't come because no one would take her Saturday shift at Betty's) down to Opp, Alabama (don't ask me where it is, I have no idea) to visit some of mom's friends. -I seem to have forgotten if I told you this earlier. If so, bear with me.- Their daughter is only a year younger than me. We get along great considering that we have no choice if we want to be friends or not.  Good things about the trip:    No one fell of the boat even though we sailed through some rough water (however, I did loose my book mark)  I finished reading Sylvia Plath's  The Bell Jar  for the second time  Did I mention Jessie wasn't able to come?  I killed no one (but maybe that's a bad thing)  The others didn't make fun of me (too much) for standing on the edge of the ocean, just listening, while they played in it's waves.   I would have had to go to my Dad's house on Sunday night, but now I won't be going until later today.   We went to the beach on Sunday. Only for one day (man, was I glad too). I can't stand being in the middle of waves. Salt-water makes my eyes hurt. Sand annoys the crap out of me. But I still love the sound of ocean and the look of the waves when you're not in the middle of them. It was one of the moments when I could obviously see my differences from the rest of the group.   I loved it.
