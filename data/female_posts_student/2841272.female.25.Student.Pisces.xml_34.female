In the last couple of years memory and memory problems have become a popular theme in movies, explored in scripts as diverse as   Memento  (long-term memory loss),   Fifty First Dates  (short-term memory loss), and   Paycheck  (surgical removal of memory). Now, the star-heavy, and suprisingly low-budget   Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   is another, and on paper it is similiar to   Paycheck   because it also speculates what might happen if science could selectively delete certain troublesome memories from our psyches.  But since it comes from the pen of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman(  Being John Malkovich, Adaptation  ), it bears no further relationship to the entertaining sci-fi film and gradually emerges as another engagingly offbeat comedy-drama. The thinking is shallow. The emotions are tepid. But the creativity is dazzling. If that sounds like a slam, consider that most Hollywood screenplays are predictable, repititious, and functional -- and those are the good ones.   Eternal Sunshine  , at the very least, is an encounter with an imagination and a personality. That my friends tips it toward the positive.  When we meet Joel, played by Jim Carrey, he looks shell-shocked, riding a commuter train from New York into Long Island, lost, lonely and searching. On a train platform in Montauk, he meets a woman who's drawn to him for no apparent reason. This woman's name is Clementine(Kate Winslet), a blue-haired bookstore extremist who's as aggressive as he is withdrawn. The film zigzags through time. The most impressive sequence -- albeit somewhat slow-moving -- is the one in which Joel, unconscious, undergoes the memory-erasing process, while two technicians (Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst) get stoned and hang out in his bedroom. The movie shifts smoothly back and forth from the activity in the room to the memories in Joel's mind, to Joel's fantasies. Wanting to hold onto his memories of Clementine, Joel scrambles to hide her in remote corners of his mind, such as scenes of childhood humiliation. The filmmaking is adept enough to show, at times, snippets from the technicians' conversation floating into Joel's mind and influencing his fantasies.   The film's missing element is emotion. If we cared about Joel and Clementine as a couple, the movie might inspire a more passionate interest. But I don't think the filmakers were going for that type of movie.   Eternal Sunshine   is not about how love conquers all but about how people can be weak and foolish and waste their lives on stupid, destructive relationships. So many times I tell people to "enjoy the movie for what its worth". This movie was well acted, incredibly creative, but just lacked the emotional attachment to the main characters.
