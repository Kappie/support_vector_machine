I don't know why I'm depressed, I just know that I'm not as happy as I should be, maybe that's why I'm depressed!  Because I want to be happier, but I don't know how!  During school I asked Gabe what was wrong with me, and he just put his head down!  So I was like, NO, tell me!  And then he was like "When you say you love somebody, and then you say it to everyone else it makes it seem like it's a joke!"  So I started to feel really sad, and I made Amanda go for a walk with me and talk to me!  And I decided that I might, maybe like him!  So I told him that I loved him, and that I wasn't going to say it to anyone else!  And then he hugged me and told me that I have his heart!  Awww! Charles called me after school and was like what would you do if Gabe asked you out!  And I was like, I don't know, I might say yes!  Then Charles called back awhile later and asked me out for Gabe or something, and I was like I don't know ... and then Gabe got on the phone ... and then we got disconnected so I don't know what is going on!  Ummm ... and I really don't care!  This is odd, and I'm not sure if I like it! I don't want to seem like I slut and go out with Gabe just because he asked me out, and I can't say no to people!  I don't even know if Charles is serious, so there is really no reason for me to get stressed over it, but oh well!  I want to go out with someone that I actually like and I can see myself being with for awhile!  School is almost out, and I'm not sure if I'll see Gabe over the summer!  And I'm going to be working a lot, 2 jobs if possible, so I might not have time for anyone!  Ahh, crap!  I had a walk through at Dolphin's Cove today!  I'm so happy that I officially have the job!  I loved working there so much, it was some of the best times of my life!  And I made such great friends last summer,  Tiffany: My Morning Drinking Partner, Angela: My Lover, Nathan: Boyfriend That Nobody Wanted Me To Have, Robbie: The "One" That I Will Never Have, Alex: Ice Buddy, and Sam: Human Sex Guide!   OH, I saw Tiffany and she has really short hair now!  I love it so much!  I also saw Sam, she looks the same!  Nobody else is working there again!  They all have better jobs, or are to lazy to work!  Hmmm ... I saw Alex's friend Andrea there!  She is going to be an attendant!  Oh, she is so pretty and so nice!  I like her much!
