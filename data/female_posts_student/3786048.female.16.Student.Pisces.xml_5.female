I should have skipped this year. There's a lot of things I should and shouldn't have done this year. I'm pretty disgruntled with myself for my lack of trusting myself. If I hadn't been so gosh darn set on pleasing people I wouldn't be so mad. Now I'm gonnna be mean and evil to everyone, which I hope is a change to most of you. Okay that's a lie, no more teenage drama blues. I'm sick of it. Anyway, last night I stayed up until 2 so I could watch Molly Ringwald in  Sixteen Candles  which is a fabulous movie. She's my new role model. Speaking of Role Model, I hope  Simple Plan's new cd will be out soon. That would be a great end to my misery. I'm such a teenage drama queen. No more of this drama crap, although it might be good for a future acting career...well, peaches to all, and to all a good night
