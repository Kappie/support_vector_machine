That was cool so I showed her my drivers license and she goes "Oh my god, your from Montana? Where at?" Turns out she is from Montana too. Who would have guess that the only two people from Montana east of the Mississippi would meet in Old Navy?  I also would like to say Happy Vday to everyone. I am fortunate to have great friends who took me out to lunch today which was almost ruined by the waitress when she asked if the check would be split two and one. There is nothing like being reminded that you are single on Valentines to make you feel great about yourself! Other than that it has been a very successful day of sleeping. That's all I have done today and I am very proud of myself for it.   Tiff- I hope you have a lot of fun watching the florists today but I think you may be busy filling prescriptions for little blue pills!
