And the coolest thing ever happened last night, Gaddis had better tell you or I'm going to blow up his house, it was just that cool. And I'm sure he will. Raugh, alright, tonite has been crazy and I'm freaking the hell out like no other. It's time to do something low-energy. If anyone reads this, tell the boys of Badmoon that I won't be there, I have to make up for the fact that the cops came out here last night. Yeah.   Alright, peace.
