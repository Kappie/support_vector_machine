I'll juz do wat I can do and hand it in...   I want to think of myself as a discipline and excellant student but hmmm... probably not, I'm easily distracted, lazy, procastinator, playful in other senses, and throws in the white towel easily... My back is killing me and my eyes are dry and sore - the tangy feeling.. I feel uptite..  I was thinking abt buying myself a pair of trainers since I didn't do so the last time I went back to S'pore.. can't find a red and black Adidas (I'm fussy abt this: no red,I'll not wear)Yups, maybe after this whole thingy, I mite rock down to Smith St to get myself a pair..see how it goes... I feel like running on days like this.. but damn I don't hav a pair of functioning trainers.. my current pair is falling apart but I still love my o'l shoes, had them since I was in college...  My resolution for this one mth is to train my body up especially since I've been falling real sick.. I mite go swimming after I hand in my papers and after wrk... woo sounds fun... hee hee too bad the pools here can't be outdoors..miss the sun.. when Jac was here.. I'll juz go to her apt for a swim.. since she left I'd done it once  at the public bath..  Ok better start my wrk to keep the vibes pumpin
