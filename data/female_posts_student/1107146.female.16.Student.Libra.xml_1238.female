Well, if you are just sitting back during this whole ordeal thing, Josh, and I have absolutely no involvement in it, except for the location of the war, you and I will have lots of fun.  I'll make a few extra cupcakes and maybe some of the "modified" brownies.  Bring my sunglasses and Sims, if its loaded, please.  I guess I'll be meeting you guys Saturday...I don't have school tomorrow, so if anyone needs to talk, I'll be home most of the day.
