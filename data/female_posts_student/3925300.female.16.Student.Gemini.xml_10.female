She came over around 8 and her me and my sis all watched tv and sat on the comp lol my sis and Ash took over my AIM name talking to tall my friends it was funny. We wher all hyper we ate skittles like the whole time yummm. It was great to have some girly conversations till 2 in the morning, then both of them went through my clothes trying them on lol,lol we all 3 piled in my bed with my doggy and went to sleep afterwords only to have to wake up at 5 to go to work lol. It was funny we all wher still hyper so a morning with tons of giggling. so off to work we went it was pretty funny we just waved and stuff a few guys tried to hit on ash and I lol it was funny. The after words we came back to my house to eat the off to the mall for a concert that we couldnt see lol so we shopped and acted dumb dancing around the mall modeling clothes!! yay it was great. She left around 4 like an hour ago so my moms been yelling at me about not wanting me to ahve private convos with her lol its weird but anyways im freakin tired now trying to eat im to tired to do anything really my mind keeps wondering and whats keeping me amused is picking the fingernail pollish off my fingers lol.
