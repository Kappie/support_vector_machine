I love working out and I met this really nice girl at the gym today.  I weight a few pounds more then when I left school, but when I look at my body in the mirror it looks nicer then before.  I like my stomach now cause I barely have one, my arms feel better from all the weight lifting, and my legs are just nice and not really thin like half of the other teenagers on this planet that starve themselves.  My Mom's surgery was good, but now I have to do like everything.  My Dad is flying in from Vancouver for the final time and then we are going to go to Peters Drive In for dinner.  Tomorrow I start summer school.  I am excited, but nervous.
