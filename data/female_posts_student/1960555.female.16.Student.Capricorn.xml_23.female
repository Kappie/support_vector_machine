I was a little choked up when they played that song from Peral Harbor.  Later in Socials though, I was talking to a guy (a hottie that I wish not to vouch the name of) and he was saying that he "Just totally broke down".  That did me in.  I was so close to crying just seeing how brutally honest he was with me.  And he wasn't even embarassed about it all.  I was in total shock.  And oh my, some people are so bloody disrespectful.  The kid who was playing the trumpet that signals the begining of the moment of silence kinda messed up and there were people laughing at him and stuff.  I was quite mad at them.  I mean he did his and that's all that you can really ask a person.  He was just nervous and all.  It's a hard thing getting up infront of all of your peers.  All people ask is for you to shut up and respect fallen soldiers one a year.  15 minutes of silence isn't to hard, now is it?
