Which in all honestly i really do. i feel as if someway thinking that aloud is gonna make it go away. lets just knock on wood for good measure. well i called him at 3am, i know he's awake cause he's working and he did answer but then seem to get annoyed with me when i said my tummy hurt which it seems to be doing alot lately at 3 am. subconciously making it hurt in the middle of the night???? maybe. the body is a wonderous thing. my pysche is creeping up on me and maybe i really want it to hurt so that i can have a reason to call. damsel in distress syndrome. or not cause my stomach just gave me a kick for questioning its intentions. what to do, what to do. i miss him. if by some unknown power i can telepathically send u a message its this: call me, i miss you. lets get back together. there now thats coming from a true pathetic. i wish it would hurry up and just rain. thunder, lightning, the works please. i hate work. but i gotta make that money, honey. i swear that im schizo. one minute sad.  one minute happy, one minute confused, and then back to sad again. hmm, i think i need to concentrate on being happy. oh, but i'm so good at being sad now. k, gotta go cause im annoying myself and prolly anyone else who will read this.
