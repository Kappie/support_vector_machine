Aside from watching E! and Court TV, I am reading Hillary Clinton's book.  I never thought I'd say that.  It's not really changing my mind about her much, though.  It's a fairly good read.  I'm also volunteering at Mercy Hospital this summer, since they are doing construction on the ER.  They are totally re-doing it, so they need me to give people directions and stuff.  The worst part is, the temporary entrance for everyone (including the ambulances), so that could get quite gruesome.  They need some more help, too.  The downside is that I had to get a TB test.  I have to get another one in a couple of weeks because that was my first one.  I have to go get read today, as a matter of fact.  Maybe my mom will take me when she gets off work.  I will talk to you later!!
