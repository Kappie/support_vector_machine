It also seems that many believe that I'm not so special that I deserve special treatment.  That my Pass/Fail option is not a "get out of final free" card.  Well poo on you all!!  Actually, a little birdy put me in my place earlier this morning by basically pointing out that its all about my ego right now.  I've been put in my place and I don't like where I'm standing, so I'm pissy.  Hmm...maybe he's right.  But really, more than anything else...I'm f'in tired and feeling a bit lazy.  I want it all to be over today, not next week.  And I like to win arguments.  Okay, so maybe it IS about my ego.  Oh shut up!  Hmmph.
