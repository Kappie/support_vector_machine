I named it Phoenix Rising cuz that's what trying to survive and thrive in Vallejo is like--coming from the ashes. The soul of Vallejo is dying. Back in it's hey day it was a bustling Navy town. Now, it's dead with a dying economy. People go to neighboring and surrounding cities for entertainment, shopping, art, etc. What I'm trying to do is shake things up. People say there's nothing to do here. I say, "As long as there is 'nothing to do' there IS something to do cuz you have to build 'something' out of 'nothing.'" I have a big heart. People could understand if I want to do this for fame or money or self-promotion. But really it's cuz I have a message, and I need to get it out.   Well, coming up soon Celebration of Poetry and Arts: kick off benefit for DEAR OPRAH Book Campaign Tour, featuring Jessica Hagedorn, the national slam champ Big Poppa E., co-founder of touring spokenword women group Sister Spit--Michelle Tea, and of course, Phoenix Rising. That's my dream...to bring all the arts and poets of Vallejo to commune, converse, etc. with their neighbors--from different cities, states,--heck, let's make it global.
