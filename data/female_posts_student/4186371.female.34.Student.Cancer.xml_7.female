Maybe you're not sure what to write or if you should. The answer to the second one is "Yes, you should comment (if you feel compelled to do so, that is) and in answer to the first inquiry, I have a few suggestions: 1) You're brilliant! 2) You're a loser! 3) You have me riveted! 4) You have the maturity of a 6-year-old. 5) Why do you keep mentioning my name? Stop it! 6) Why don't you ever talk about me? Are you ashamed? Are you embarrassed? I'm a person too, you know! 7) Reading your blog gives me something to do in my otherwise boring and mundane life. Thanks for giving my life purpose. 8) You're funny (hehehehehe) 9) Don't you ever talk about anything important?  Well, you get the idea. And I'm sure you have lots of other profound and neurotic things to say about my posts. Hey, to each his/her own. Happy commenting!!!
