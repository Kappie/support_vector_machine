It is Bacardi 151, which comes with its own flame-retardant cap.    3. The recipe used for Windex shots last night severely altered the ratios used by the bartenders at Scruffy’s. I know this because this morning there is much more Blue Curacao left than 151.    4. The correct recipe for mixing a Windex shot is, according to Cameron and Shawn: “Does it look like Windex? Does it smell like Windex? Does it taste like Windex? Then it’s a Windex shot!” So by that definition, the recipe was okay.    5. People who say, “No, you’ll like this tequila shot; this tequila is really smooth!” are usually lying. Last night was no exception.    6. Michele has no qualms about lying in my bathroom floor for several hours of the party, then calling me a “wuss” multiple times because I went to bed before she went home.    7. If you play pool with someone, you are obligated to sleep with them. Or so some patrons believed.    8. No matter how festive a party might be, if there are at least two church-staters present, a vehement argument regarding the Establishment Clause will occur.    9. A broken Craftmatic bed is possibly the worst place to pass out, especially if your back was already a little sore from keg-wrestling. I woke up in a position most commonly associated with giving birth.    10. I’m going to miss Sabrina very, very much.
