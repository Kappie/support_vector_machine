And Tyler is a dreadlocking master. I wish I knew how to put pictures on this stupid thing. Id ask Lauren but she left me. Bah! Meh, Next time for sure.  And Kyles got a girlfriend!! And Im pretty sure [no, Im really sure] that me and Lauren are more excited than Kyle is. But whatever. Thats not important, and I think I see a double date coming up in the near future.. yup. I do.   Listening To:  well nothing, but I wish I was listening to Love On The Rocks With No Ice by The Darkness because it is my new favourite song.. oh how I love you, Justin Hawkins. What a rock star.   So many issues we should address 'Cause our lives dont correlate All the emotions that we suppress Bite our tongues until its too late  Love on the rocks, you'd do anything for a quiet life Love on the rocks, Love on the rocks with no ice
