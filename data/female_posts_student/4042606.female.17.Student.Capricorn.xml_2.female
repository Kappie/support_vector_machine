If I haven't told you already, I am going with my dad to Tampa Bay, Florida. Finally going on vacation! So, even though I will have my laptop with me, I probably won't be posting much so you'll have to rely on Ian for posts! Anyway he will probably post the south park characters later this weekend. Otherwise, things will be normal!
