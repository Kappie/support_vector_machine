La Resistance just won the Tag team Champions from Edge  Chris Benoit..oh yeah! That two idiotic freaks just won..  i just can't believe it! But in the other side.. Shelton Benjamin got the Intercontinental Champ from one of my crush, Randy.. i was suppose to be dissapointed cause Randy loose  i don't even like Shelton, but i was shocked  a bit..happy?! hehe.. Know what?! i like Matt Hardy  Lita together! (don't know why!) maybe they really do fit together! i just hope Kaene don't get in the way! I just simply don't like Tayson Tomco.. he sucks!! He just broke Y2J's ribs..huhu.. He's bad!! He will pay on bad blood!! And the past episode of 'raw' was so exciting! Specially the part when Y2J  Shelton teamed up againts Randy  Ric Flair.. i also loved when Shawn attacked Triple H.. They didn't stop! hehe.. They just did when Eric told them that they'll have a Hell in a cell match! wooaahh! Can't wait for bad blood! Ok, so.. i haven't control myself from lookig for the results of Badblood.. but damn! Triple H defeated Shawn! i am so distraught!
