Both wound up around my body until, and from behind began nudging me with their heads. I let them nudge me to my knees, and then I slowly pushed myself off the ground. Both slithered around my feet, and walked ahead of me a few steps, and paused, looking back at me at the same time, as if they were one person, to see if I was following them.  “I’m coming,” I sighed, still unsure of why I knew I could talk to anything and everything here. I followed the twin cats for a long while, watching, as the trees seemed to glimmer while the night grew darker. The stars seemed dull compared to their leaves, and they sung quiet songs as I tiptoed down the path.   Suddenly the cats stopped. They turned to each other, and raised their front paws as if to fight, but instead, their bodies entwined around each other to form a beautiful willowy figure dressed in a gossamer dress, that shone as bright as the trees. She was gifted with long shimmery light brown hair, and fair skin. I wanted to touch her. Then she spoke to me in the harshest of tones.  “Your hair is pretty,” she said matter-of-factly as she turned pirouettes down the path and around me.  “Thank you” I said confused, I didn’t remember that she had once been a single spirit in the body of two cats. As she turned, her hair spiraled up into red streaked ringlets, like mine. Then she turned again, and her skin was no longer pale, it was a dark olive, like mine. She stopped twirling around me for a moment and walked up close to me.  “You look like you need help; do you want me to help you?” She shook her head and her hair fell out of the ringlets, and her skin was again fair as a china doll. I stared into her brown eyes, and they seemed truthful, but I wasn’t sure, because I could see a wall behind them. I had no one to trust, however, and so I accepted her help.  “Where to?” She asked dancing down the path.  “The castle…” I started.  “Down yonder. The castle, down yonder…” she trailed off into singing that phrase into the air as she danced around me.  “Are you going to help me?” I asked a little annoyed.  “Of course, I’m helping you know. See you just need to follow me,” she continued in circles around me for what seemed like months until she finally began prancing down the path. I followed her cautiously, waiting for her to spin off the road. She stopped.  “Can you dance?” she asked me raising one eyebrow.  “Yea,” I said unsure of what was to come next.  “Not better than me,” she said pretentiously.  “Why does it matter?” I asked her.  “Do you want me to help you?” She said angrily. Her clothes changed to match the pattern of my jeans and tight black t-shirt. Then they quickly shifted back to her own. She grew as tall as me, and then immediately shrunk to her own height again. Her hair kept altering from mine to hers. I looked at her strangely. Who was this girl?  “Yes I do, but I don’t see what that has to do with you helping me,” I said backing away from her. “If you weren’t going to help me in the first place, why didn’t you just say so?” She stepped up into my face.  “I’m sorry I promise I’ll help you this time, but I can’t help you if you are better than me. If you were better than me then you wouldn’t need help,” she said into my face. I stared back at her. What was she saying to me? “Well do you need help or not?” She asked again.  “Yes I need your help,” I said as she spun off again, this time towards a tree, and then she sat down beside it, and began picking at a flower.  “Come here,” she beckoned, and I sat next to her. She pinned a the ragged flower in my hair and smiled at the effect. “It’s not as pretty as mine,” she said pointing to the large red rose that appeared in her hair. Then it faded into pink, and then yellow, and then white. “Which color do you like best?”  “Red, I guess, look can you help me?” I said exasperated with this girl.  “Sure,” she said absentmindedly. I stood up, wrongly assuming she would do the same.  “Okay,” I looked down at her.  “Mhmm,” she blinked up at me innocently. “Do you think I’m pretty, because sometimes I think I am, and then sometimes I think not so much? What do you think?” I stared at her incredulously.  “You’ve promised me your help several times. Will you help me or are you just wasting my time?”  “Yes you’re wasting my time, you can go. That way,” she pointed the direction we had come, and waved her other hand making a mirror appear in her hand. She examined her reflection. “I need someone else like me, hmm,” she appeared to think for a moment, and then shook her arm off. A new one grew in it’s place, and another being grew from her arm. A boy this time, with dark hair and olive skin. He sat next to her and wrapped his arms around her.  “You are beautiful,” he said to her, “Am I?”  “Of course,” she giggled and batted her eyelashes at him. I stared at her sadly. So much for a promise. I shrugged and started heading the way I had been in the first place. I would have to do this on my own.
