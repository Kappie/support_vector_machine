Then we walked to Joseph's work place. I got a bunch of people to sign my yearbook. Kevin gave me a condom and told me to be safe. Aye, aye. I'm taking a pic of it. We went to the theater...blah blah... !!!! The movie was sooo good. It was HILARIOUS. I was giggling the whole time...it's funnier if you understand Thai people, their way of talking and joking around... It was sad too. It starts out with the protagonist's sister getting killed in a terrorist attack...and his niece gets hurt.  Anyway  I loved seeing the skanks. And now I know what the whole thing about the trousers is about. Hella dumb...   Checking up on Shanelle...  Me: Did your dad yell at you last night? Shanelle: No. He wasn't home. Me: Hmmm...I bet he was with his little girlfriend. Shanelle: I found an orange condom filled with white stuff in his bathroom garbage. Hecka nasty. Me: Ooh, fun.   Emily and Tsedey came over last night. We watched Dead Presidents. I took pictures of them on the roof. There's a picture of Tsedey holding a water bottle and Emily is trying to...you know...suck on it. We're the sickest group of girls you'll ever meet. We don't actually do shit, but the things we say aren't very ladylike. Not a minute goes by without one of us saying "Suck my dick, bitch.". I told Tsedey...nevermind. Too stupid and embarassing.  Tsedey's always licking people....Emily's constantly spacing out...I'm...what do I do? Oh, I'm the mother, the photographer, cook, AND the pimp (Madame Toureille, thank you very much). Not self proclaimed. They know I am. They are my ten cent hoes. They can do anything...and anyone. I love my hoes.
