I just had that, and I had a PB et J for breakfast. So my eating schedule is sdrawkcab but it's alright...I'm recording today and I deserve it.  GOD, how I hate and love recording. Especially since no one is here to help me...the problem is, my cables don't stretch far enough, so I can't set the console next to me. Which means, I have to press record, then do a dive to get over the drum kit and on the throne so I can start. Blah, plus, I haven't configured the mics to this new setup, so I have to keep stopping the damn thing, undoing it all, and starting it over til I get the levels all right. But considering no one cares about this wonderous incident in its text form, it's all good, once again.  I dropped AP English today...eep, sorry if I piss off anyone by this, I just might. But I figure, I really need to get a job, plus I don't understand what I'm doing 90% of the time while tackling the subject matter. But it's ok because I've already done the summer reading for Honours,  Pudd'nhead Wilson  by Mark Twain, which was a really good book, and  Catcher in the Rye  by J.D. Salinger, which was a really weird book. I could see why it would drive some nutcase to kill somebody...it made  me  want to kill somebody. But I finished that "classic" piece of literature and so it's all out of the way.  In other words, I'm set for school, who else is? No, don't answer, talking about school is too painful, I just remembered.  I miss Abby. But she'll be here in like, five minutes so **YE-AH**...not literally but whatever. But I really do, a whole lot.   Because you all really care...   Heheheh.  Well, have fun kidz, hopefully BLogger will stop being scroo'd and get back to the norm. Peace out dawgz.
