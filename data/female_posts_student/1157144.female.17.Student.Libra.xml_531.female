Well, the Shakespeare Santa Cruz is putting on a performance of Hamlet in the Glen (which is a bar/restaurant in Willow Glen).  I suggest we take advantage of this event and buy tickets to see it together.  Here is the website, check the schedule, and then post the dates that work for you (please make the dates after August 1st?  That is when Summer School ends).  Everyone is welcome, even if you don't have AP english.  http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org/summer03/calender.shtml  With that said I am going to HULK OUT fo sho!
