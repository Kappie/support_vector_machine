'm finishing the pre-requisites this coming fall and appying for the program in November. It sounds like you're working really hard in school so don't give up. Continue all your hard work and you'll get your BSN.  :)  So you saw my little cousin's pictures? Aren't they cute? Clarissa is almost 2 in December and she's so adorable and makulit. Her big sister Czarinna is turning 7 in December and she'll be in first grade this fall.  I taught her how to read. :)
