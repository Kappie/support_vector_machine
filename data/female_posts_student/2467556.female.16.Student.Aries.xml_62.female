But Rizzo is mine and OC is Brittany's.  Thank you that will be all.  haha oh yeah i forgot to include this one part of the story where me and Brittany exaggerated our one hockey game that we played at her house.  So i'm all like "i'm going to kick your ass next time we play" because Britty's all saying "mean" stuff about me and she started all saying "Bring it!!!! I'm not afraid of pain!!!!".  That was really funny and i forgot to write it.  Sorry, lol.  That was one of the really funny parts to the night.  ok i'm really done now, ~~~Taylor~~~
