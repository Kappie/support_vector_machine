For some reason, I just get this overwhelming sense that I'm so lucky to have the people I'm with, even though some of the conversations I can't reflect back on and smile. I'm glad they're here, though. It's something to remind me of what I used to be.   I'm glad I don't save them often, either. Some just aren't worth remembering. There are some things in there that just make me hold my breath. Others I scroll down quickly to avoid revisiting awkward details.   I've always been one for intense sentimentality. I don't like to throw away ticket stubs or napkins or little remembrances for fear that oh, that slip of paper touched France with me and to subject that precious item to the dump for all eternity is quite troubling. But seriously. Maybe that's why I always have papers all over the place. I haven't been taking enough pictures, but hopefully now that I actually have the means for putting them on the computer I'll be able to better document visual memories. I remember last summer. I found a stub from Pirates of the Caribbean the other day, and I remember the day we went. I know Katy was there, and so was Lauren. Katy couldn't stop laughing afterwards, and nobody knew why.  And then I think: If Harvard's anything like YSP, life will be good.  I'll be in a nostalgic mood for a while.
