I was in Cabin 7, (out of 7 girl cabins), but we were SUPPOSED to get the FANCY COOL 'Moore Cottage' because they switch off every year between the oldest girls and the oldest boys, and the boys got it LAST year, so therefore it was OUR turn for the cabin with a PORCH, a COUCH, a HUGE BATHROOM, an ARMCHAIR and ... A MINIFRIDGE (yeah wtf). Whereas the other cabins are just rectangles with beds in them... Cabin rivalries begin.... So... me and the Cabin 7 girls decided to steal the minifridge.... which... of course is against the rules because girls can't go in boys cabins... but one day... the boys were out of the cabin going to lunch and me, and my friends Rhiannon and Liz, were walking by and we just spontaneously decided to jump through the window and get the fridge... heh... funny stuff. The Moore cottage boys found out by the end of the day and found it ERGH... the next night cabin 6's and cabin 8's mattresses were gone... and were found behind our cabin.. we were FRAMED... haha it was funny.. boys are dumb.  Our counselors were really afraid of retaliation from the boys (they locked up their suitcases) so they struck a deal with the Moore counselors that we would just wear red letter 'T's' like in the Scarlet Letter.. I was friends with a couple Moore boys so I talked my way out of it but it was very funny nontheless. This was my last year and I'm so insanely sad about not coming back... it's so so so much fun and I've been going there every summer for 6 years. But I did turn in an application to be a counselor next year, which would be 4 weeks worth of camp wow. Mostly I'm going to miss the people... living with 10 other people in a cabin for a week and being at camp all week non-stop with everybody gets you really close, fast.... I feel like I just lost some best friends... like Rhiannon, and Jen, and James...  But... we'll keep in touch...
