In Chinese culture, it is not easy for people to say “no.”  For example, when a manager say “no” to an employee, the employee may take it very seriously and may be hard to get over the emotional damage caused by the word.  Moreover, “no” for some people may means, for instance, “not to see each other anymore.”Well, from my point of view, everyone have the right to say no. In business, only do things that we can do and things that need to do.
