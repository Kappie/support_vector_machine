I love work...i don't see y ppl complain lol....but i'm told it gets old fast. The cutest little girl was talkin to me when she went through the line saying "Be extra careful not to break the eggs...cuz then the egg monster will come, and we dont want that." lolol MCAS was pretty annoying today in school. It wasn't hard...just annoying. I was supposed to hang out with Eric and Melissa tomorrow night but I switched hours with a girl from work so i gotta work 5-10. But hey, more money for me :) 2 more days till the Kiss Concert! I'm almost more excited to take the limo there lolol. But it kinda sucks that i have to get up at 5 to be ready for 7. Thats the same time i fricken get up for school. But its all worth it to see Maroon 5...
