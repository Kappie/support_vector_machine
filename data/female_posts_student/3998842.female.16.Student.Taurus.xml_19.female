I’ll watch you  Bleed as  you scream as  you cry as  you call as  you Die.    Call for her  but she ignores.  Hearing you and  answering only my call.    Dependably unreliable to you.    You’re beautiful  as you lay  stained  as you beg  broken  as you cry  scarred.    Pale flesh encased in  darkness  disguises  Pain and  Lust and  Fear and  You    Hide from yourself  Run Forever  Forgot to live but  Now you’ll  Die.    Stand and watch  as you pale as  you beg as  you need.    I’ll call her to me.    We will share  in your Death  as we shared  in your Life.    Drink your life and  your Death and  you’re Pain.    Bleed out as  your tear falls  on the pavement  As you stare into  my Adrenaline Eyes  as I call your Death  to me with my laugh,  my Kiss,  my Love.    Stare into my Adrenaline Eyes  and watch my soul evaporate.      ~fin~
