I am no greater then your beauty and you are no better then my cuteness. We were cut from a corresponding cloth, maybe you have yet to realize it, or maybe you think you match better with the threads in which she was weaved. Maybe I lost my initial gleam, or maybe the tin can telephone wire was severed (lol). I am wondering how we got this far... why it didnt just end after sex. There has to be something here and I am trying my hardest to keep it but your holding us down, so if you really want to be with me then prioritize. I love you more then you can know, because if you did the world would have to be limitless.                                                                  - I will love you always and forever.    .:Sam:.
