I have fire bridage training tomorrow morning and its so crap cos both Mya and Michelle aren't going (Mya soccer and Michelle the unco broke her leg so that means i won't have a buddy the entire time Mya is in Germany grrrr). I guess ill have to hang out with Luke whatshisface and the other retards *shiver*. Oh and I must not forget Beaver. ewwww *signs*.  Yeah Maya remind us to teach you the sign for "well" me and Sim learnt it last night...its really cool.  I guess i *should* do some work seeing as I have done absolutely none since school went back (I live each week by going "2 more periods to stay awake for" then "2 more days to survive till weekend" then "7 more weeks till holidays" unfortunately I dont seem to get that its "5 more weeks till prelims" and like 1 more week till the first wave of assignments are due AND more scarily 9 MORE WEEKS TILL YEAR 12 AHHHHHHHH.  On the other hand its only about 4.5 months till Woodford!! ;)
