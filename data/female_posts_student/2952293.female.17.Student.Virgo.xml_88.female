And if I ever hear you complaining about your story, especially you Allison Elia, just know that I win this round.  I began my orthodontic treatment when I was in the second grade. By that time my mouth had shown to be very messed up. Doctor Cook began me with some spacers and what not, finally moving up to my first big treatment. I got my palate expander around spring break. I hated when my mom turned the key, it hurt a lot. I spent a week with my aunt who had to do it for me. Needless to say, she didn't do it right, and I had to do an extra week of key-turning. Here and there I had a few teeth pulled (5) and other little things. I got braces: one, two, THREE times! I've probably had every single package of animal rubber bands, from the bear to the eagle, my mouth is a living zoo. I had my fernectame (who knows?) cut off, ligaments scraped from my teeth, my 12 year molars were impacted, had to get gum cut open for those bad boys. I had all my wisdom teeth out and went on a crazy trip with the toenail fungus germ guy. As you can see, I have had it all done! But alas, it's never done. My jaw had a sudden growth spurt, causing everything to shift and become basically fucked up. My 12 year molars are fused to the bone, which apparently very rarely happens, and there is nothing to do about that. Dr. Cook says I may get TMJ, because now my bite is off... and the only way to fix it? Break my jaw and slap on 20 more months of braces. I've decided to decline his offer.  As you can see, my mouth sucks. So NEVER complain about yours! WHAHAHA
