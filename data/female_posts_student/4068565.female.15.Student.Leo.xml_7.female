First I find out that after all the good news of my Grandpa not having cancer last night...he had a bad fall and hit his head. Then this morning he was doing alright but around 12 or so he got all weak and didnt want to move. We got him to bed and when he woke up from his nap he thought my Grandma was my aunt Merna Rae. They took him over to the hospital in Spencer and my mom was there for a long time. She finally came home...crying. They took a head scan and the doctor thinks its something but my parents wont tell me what. All they said is that if it is...what they think...he has no chance. *sigh* Its horrible around here...nobody stops crying. Its really hard...I haven't lost a family member in a long time and I guess it feels like I have a closer relationship with my Grandpa Frick than any of the others we've lost. And remembering what my mom told me just this morning make me cry even more. I can't stop. I really need to talk to someone. I think im gonna go now...and call Arik. I love you Grandpa I hope you know that. I just wish you would get better. I love you.  -Tara
