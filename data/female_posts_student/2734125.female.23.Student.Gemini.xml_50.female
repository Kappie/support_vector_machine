When I heard that some people dream in black and white, I was slightly confused- color is vivid in my dreams.  At times it is more impressive then story, plot, or characters in the matted dream conversation.  The last few days I've woken up tired, but refreshed.  Contradiction?  Its not that I don't want to get up, I feel like I've slept, I feel that there has been rest, and I know there have been dreams (they are circling in my head, like fish beneath the surface of a dark pond) but I am also drained- I've been walking all night on tired dream feet.  I've been circling the world in my sleep, the stories, though I cant recall them exactly, have been repetitive, and fun, and stressful.  I was in the lab last night late, later then my posting time would imply.  I was trying to post, but it was too late at night to be at school and not to be in some romantic corner of the library drinking coffee and looking like a classic grad student, so I pressed publish on the strangeness and rode home.  Today is a work day.  I've said that before, but today cannot afford not to be a work day.  Today, I am going to write something for my classes, even if it sucks.  Even if I would never ever ever think about turning it in, I am going to get something into my sick little computer (it has a virus, and I am praying that it holds out just a little longer... like till Friday... so that I can take it somewhere.  When I try to open the media player, msn comes up twice.  It has also been turning itself on, which is a little freaky and I don't know if the computer store people will believe me on that one...).  There are two vases of fresh flowers on my desk, and it was warm enough last night to fight with my covers, open my window, and shower before bed just to evaporate into the night air.  I rode home in just a loose button up shirt (with pants too... we should mention that) last night (and just recalled part of my dream which involved a friend smoking something that wasn't weed... some kind of herbal high, but it was harsh and she looked very uncomfortable with the results) and was perfectly warm and cool.  Applied to jobs yesterday, thought about papers, thought about people, thought about next year.    When I feel like I'm getting my footing, when I feel secure in where I am, I think about my own spine.  I have a tattoo there, it travels down my back directly over my spine, and starts with a black circle filled in, then there are moons progressively changing to full - and full moon in the middle of my back- and then progressing the rest of the way of my tail bone into new again.  13 circles down my spine.  Their permanence reminds me of the cyclical nature of the world, and the change that has to come during a life cycle.  We start, we live, we die- it seems without fail.  I have no doubt that there are people who can tease death for a while, but it waits, and is skilled at hunting.  This passage seems to have little in common with the rest of this rant... I hope you don't mind.  It still feels early, there is sleep stinging my eyes...
