Needless to say my efforts have disappeared and I'm irritated!  Right what have I been up to? Well, lots really.  My world was turned upside down a fortnight ago when my grandmother died. Despite her being 87 and me only being 23 we were very close. She had always been there in my thinking. I think pretty much all of my earliest memories envolved her in some way or another. It hit me harder than I realised it would - I had lost a much loved Grandmother and a very good friend.  I'm not so sure whether I had quite realised how ill she was, I suppose more than anything I always imaginedthat this very strong and determinedlady whould somehowstabilise but it wasn't to be. Ijust feel relieved that her final few hoursof decline were softened by morphine. All I can say is that heart failure and fibrosing alveolitis are not a nice way to go; justtry watching someone you know and love fighting for breath whilst being on oxygen therapy. It amazes me, and it was pretty much all I could think about during the funeral a week ago, how well she coped with her condition.She knew she was going to die soon yet she remained positive, I could still get a smile from her with one of mybizarrecoments.She was still fully aware of what was goingon into her final hours, enough to instruct family members to keep an eye on my Mum and Aunt. I think it was purely a matter of faith - there was no doubt in her mind at any time about her strong Christian beliefs indeath and the afterlife. Sitting here today thinking about it I must say that I'm in awe of that level of faith. As we sorted out her things, I found herbible andsince neither my Mum nor Aunt wanted it, I took it,ithas become one of my cherished possessions.  I saw my Gran's body about 10 minutes after she'd died and I was relieved for her that her struggle was over. Last weekend we buried her in the same grave as my Grandfather, beside my Great Uncle. Ilike to think that they're all catching up somewhere and no doubt looking down on us from time to time, probably having a joke at out expense.  Anyhow, on a different note, I'm now half way through my pediatrics block. Today I am supposed to be writing my elective project - but hey! Blogging is such a good distraction.  Right back to work.
