Went rollerblading with Wayman, then Rae came over and we skateboarded in my driveway! I attempted an ollie! Oh yea! The bad news is I can only get about 1/4 inch of air, because I just can NOT get the timing down. And I can like pivot off the back wheels...oh yea...haha. Yea, I'm such a dork. And no, I'm not trying to be some skater or anything, it's just one of those things that if I never do it, I'll regret it some day. And I can't live with regrets! Because they just haunt me...and I don't like it. Anyways, I don't have much else to say...so I'll see you guys tomorrow.
