Actually a lot frequently than I want it to. And it really REALLY scares me. I'm past the point of feeling sorry for myself. Sometimes I want to go lock myself into my room and cry my eyes out, but for some reason I can't. I can't cry because it's so far beyond crying. I just feel sad about it. And I'm not a sad person. I'm a happy, positive, optimistic person. And it makes me sick that I'm sad about being alone. After all, I'm not entirely alone- I have my family. But sometimes that just isn't enough. I want more.  Maybe if I had a boyfriend I wouldn't feel entirely alone. A guy that would be my boyfriend and my friend at the same time. A boyfriend that I could just hang out with and talk. I'm so sick of being alone. I'm ready to find that one person...mentally and emotionally. I'm ready for that person to find me. I hate waiting. It makes me sick. I don't want to be alone anymore. It's not that I need a boyfriend to make me feel better about myself..it's just that now is the perfect time for me to have one. I need one now more than ever...since the falling out with my little group of friends. I want someone to want me. I'm sick and tired of feeling alone, and it makes me sick that I can't do anything about it. All I can do is wait...
