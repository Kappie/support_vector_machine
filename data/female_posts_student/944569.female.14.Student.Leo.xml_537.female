I believe that this monster deserves nothing other than an execution.  Who could possibly kill a girl like that?  WHAT A  COWARD !!!!!  I really really hope they get an execution because:  A) they killed a child who hasn't even lived her life yet B) it's people like them that waste the oxygen in the air and are a waste of blood and flesh in this world C) there is no excuse for this outrage! D) All of the Above  Answer: D)  augh!  This is so stupid, though!  They're probably going to put that person in jail for a year or two and set them free again.  YEAH RIGHT!!  As if that's gonna teach them a lesson!  Blood for blood, death for a death.   I believe in that for case of murders and murders only!  If you're gonna put them in jail like that, why dont you just give them a stupid lollipop, pat them on the head and tell them they did nothing wrong.
