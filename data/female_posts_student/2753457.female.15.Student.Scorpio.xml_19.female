Philip and Zak embarrassed me a little when they chased after each other with the former's hat, but not enough to really care.  You can't take us anywhere in public.  Then we went to the store that I can't remember the name of with all the massaging chairs and cuddly pillows.  They had to drag me away from that chair.  So nice, so nice.  Haha, we went to two different photobooths, because that's the kind idiots we are.  And to top it off, we shook our polaroid pictures, and sang the song to go with it.  Wait, maybe I was the only one who did that last bit.  Then, I attempted to put Sarah and Hanna's new earrings in, but my fingers were too big. Watched "Ten Things I Hate About You" at Sarah's, which is fun, and interesting to actually  see  it.  Back at home, discovered that I still have the screenplay saved as a word document. Good news:  Today, made an AWESOME cd of all my music that I'm discovering.  I was so excited, I was literally hopping up and down while I waited for it to finish.  It has a lot of stuff, Velvet Underground, Radiohead, Elliott Smith, Dandy Warhols, Hot Hot Heat, all that good stuff.  You know you're excited too. Bad news:  I tried to revive the scanner to put my polaroid on the desktop, but it just decided to suck.  Blah.  Excepting the cd, today was not a good day.  Felt really bad and depressed.  And I fell asleep downstairs again last night. I'm gonna fix up for tomorrow.  If we have to go to school and it's icky and it messes up my hair, I may scream.  Really may.
