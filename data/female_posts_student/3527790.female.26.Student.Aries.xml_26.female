Ok maybe sneaking in wasn't the best thing in the world to do but it sure was fun and there is No way I can afford a membership there!!   ANYWAYS!  The swim class was great. Number one the people there all know me from when I used to work there. Number two they are WAY better triathletes that I am so it challenges me. And three the coach is very helpful. Not only did I get one of the best swim workouts I have had in a while. Let me just was that 10 repeats of your "fastest" 100m where you are supposed to build on each repetition...is tiring to say the least. But I did it. What was exciting for me is the last time I attended that class the coach had me do a different workout than everyone else because there was NO way I could keep up to them! However, this time even though I was slower than them I was able to complete the whole workout which I was VERY proud of!  Anyways I need to get to work I have been slacking off all day...Its been great. hehe. I got a lot or organizing crap done though so that is good!
