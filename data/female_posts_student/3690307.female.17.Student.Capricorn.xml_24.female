Because Lauren got the times confused, poor Johnny and Braleigh couldn't help out, but, it was just as well, because I would've embarrassed myself in front of them. I was actually so weak. There were some things I tried to lift, but my shoulder popped out of it's socket with the strain. Lol! What the fuck. I knew I was a weakling, but this was a humbling experience.    After a half n' hour passed, I kept seeing violent images of my broken body lying prone as blood seeped across the concrete. I thought I was going to die. I remember telling Lauren that I should phone someone to take the job, because I was a fraud. I kept working...    It was probably around the time when Lauren and I were doing hulk impressions, throwing heavy things into the dumpster, that I realized what a whiner I was being. A lot of the heavy heavy lifting could be done in two ways, with brute force, or a more careful application of strategic strength. YES! I could do strategic strength. It was pretty sweet-awesome-cool!    Anyway, even though I'm a big slut, I learned that I should stop being such a bitch and just DO ET! Lol! I should probably start this "Stop Brittany from being a whiny bitch" by stopping from apologizing so much for things that aren't my fault. Lol. Yes! Word up, brotha
