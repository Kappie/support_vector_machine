I will be spending the weekend up north with my dad, step mom, and grandma on our anual trip. This will be the shortest period of time i have gone up though.. it kind of sucks. I was thinking about maybe going tomorrow but i really should save the gas and go with my grandma. AND it might be hard for me because i cant really do a whole lot this year (cuz of the piece of shit back) but it will still be fun. Lots of relaxing, eating, cards, and of course fishing! I hope i get more than i did last year. My sister isnt able to go this year either so that will be a first, and that really sucks. I wish she could go.. its a lot more fun then. Oh well! im off to bed.. had a long day of studying and testing and taking back cans .. 30 bucks baby!
