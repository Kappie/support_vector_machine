Now, if I get less than 9, I'm sleepy for the rest of the day. And if I get more than 9.5 hours, I'm sleepy for the rest of the day. It's tough to hit that sweet spot. Especially when my apartment is so hot. And Sean's back is so sore that he's been tossing and turning all night. Which, of course, makes me toss and turn.  Oh well. Enough complaining. Back to work.
