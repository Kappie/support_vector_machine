The friggin' gym teacher's talking about I gotta be able to jump rope for 1.5 minutes in order to pass, but I can't get past 21 seconds. I mean, it's not me, it's the people who are turning. Oh yeah, peepZ have to turn FOR US. If I could jump by myself, it'd be cake, but oh NOOO. Ugh. So what, short post, boo on alla ya.      Except NeurotiK... you know who you are. lmao    Lotsa Love, SmoOkie
