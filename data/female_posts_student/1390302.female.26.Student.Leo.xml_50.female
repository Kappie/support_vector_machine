Now don’t get me completely wrong, I know that there is.  I love football, it’s by far my favorite sport, but I saw something today that just infuriated me!  I was watching the Houston Texans v. Jacksonville Jaguars game on CBS this afternoon, which was a great game, and I saw the most UNSPORTSMAN-like thing I have ever seen.  As long as I have been watching and LOVING football I have seen some pretty low blows but this took the cake.  So here’s what happened…  J.J. Moses went back for the punt (or Kick?) return –which he had been very successful doing the entire game- anyway, he started to call fair catch when out of nowhere came #17 Jimmy Redmond and hit the poor guy, knocking him to the ground.  A penalty was called on the guy, but what he did was just sooooo messed up that I am still pissed and that game has been over for 15 minutes.  Basically it came down to the fact that the sorry jackass was taking revenge for J.J.’s incredible success in running on his team!  All I have to say is that perhaps he should take a good long look at himself and his team and their inability to stop the run!  So to make a long story short, I now HATE the Jacksonville Jaguars, believing them to be terrible sportsmen, and really sorry losers!  ~Kristyn
