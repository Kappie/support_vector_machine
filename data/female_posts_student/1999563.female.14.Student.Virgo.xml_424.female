But during the night I just got sicker and sicker. I was sweating like a marshmallow. It was disgusting! When I got up I could barley stand and I almost fell over. My vision got all cloudy...  But I have to be an usher at CYT all day..I'm kinda stuck. I wish I could stay home,but I already said I would be an usher.
