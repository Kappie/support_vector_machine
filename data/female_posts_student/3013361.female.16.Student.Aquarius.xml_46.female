Her cover of The White Stripes' song Fell in Love with a Boy is awesome! Just for fun here come the lyrics:  Fell in love with a boy Fell in love once and almost completly He's in love with the world Sometimes these feelings can be so misleading He turns and says "Are you alright?" Oh, I must be fine 'cause my hearts still beating Come and kiss me by the riverside, Sarah says it cool, she don't consider it cheating Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah Red hair with a curl Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping Can't keep away from the boy That 2 sides on my brain need to have a meeting Can't think of anything to do My left brain knows all love is fleeting He's looking for something new I said it once before but it bears repeating Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah Can't think of anything to do My left brain knows all love is fleeting He's looking for something new I said it once before but it bears repeating Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah Fell in love with a boy Fell in love once and almost completly He's in love with the world Sometimes these feelings can be so misleading He turns and says "Are you alright?" Oh, I must be fine 'cause my hearts still beating Come and kiss me by the riverside, Sarah says it cool, she don't consider it cheating Oh, don't go tellin' no more, don't go tellin' no more, don't go tellin' no more lies on Sarah Don't go tellin' no more, don't go tellin' no more, don't go tellin' no more lies on Sarah Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah
