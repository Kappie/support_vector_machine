If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn't that be something?  I promise I might not walk on by Maybe next time but not this time  Even though I know I don't want to know Yeah, I guess I know I just hate how it sounds  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing... If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn't that be something?
