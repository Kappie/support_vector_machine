We are hoping to at least make $2000 off the stand. This is our first year and we are talking about doing it again next year. Once we are established and people find out that our prices are cheaper or the same as every where else we'll be able to make more. Hope everyone is having a safe and fun 4th.     HAPPY 4TH OF JULY
