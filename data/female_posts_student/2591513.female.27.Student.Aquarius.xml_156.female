I stopped taking my meds because I thought I was too young to be taking so many medications, so as soon as I stopped having frequent migraines, I stopped, cold turkey.  Now I am getting these horrible migraines and I have just been so irritable.  So anyway, we went to the American Heart Walk Team Captain dinner.  It was fun and so nice to meet everyone there.  I thought eveyone was very kind and well they have become like extended family. I haven't met a group of people more dedicated to the cause.  They have asked that Bailey and I participate in a rally at Zimmer Dental.  We are supposed to be a mission moment speaker, so basically I would have to do another speech to try and get more people involved with the cause.  I would have to talk about Bailey's condition and why we do the walk.  I really do not mind.  I hate public speaking, but this is for a very worthy cause.  I would do everything for my son, even solicit help from strangers.  I see what this money can do for the families affected by heart disease.  I feel their pain and their joy.  So if you guys don't mind sharing the link and asking a few of your own friends and family, that would be great.  It would mean the world to me.  I hope all of you are having a great week.  Hey we are almost half way done.  WOOHOO!
