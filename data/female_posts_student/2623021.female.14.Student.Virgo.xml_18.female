We took a bath in the lake are wearing cute tubtops and skirts, matching mix-matched swim suits, and are heading out to the dunes to have   hardcore boarding, sun, sand, and fun times!    I love the summer , I love   coloages!   I love staying up to unbelieve hours being   fricken hyper   and making  no sense , laying in bed staying up until my mom goes to work because it made sense to me!
