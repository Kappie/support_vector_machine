I feel that Algor according to Jane's Blog has it correct.        I feel that "Love" is defined differently by everybody.  Here's some input from me on my heart...      When I am really sad I get a deep feeling in my chest right by my heart.  I guess it feel like my chest is caving in..      When I am anticipating an answer that I don't necessarily know if I want the answer to, if I am upset, or my adrenaline is pumping  my heart beats so loud and hard I feel like it could explode.      Then there is certain points of time that my heart just feels like it is quivering, like waves are passing through it.  That is my feeling of love that I associate with my husband.  The only time that I feel it is when he holds me, kisses me, or ect...  Thats is the only way I can describe it for myself, even though that definition is narrowed a bit.      Love towards my children:  I refer to love because I could not care for them any more than I do.  I want the best things possible for them no matter what it takes.  I never want them to have difficult lives, even though sometimes keeping that from happening may be impossible.   Other things I could not care less about.      So Love...  may be a definition that you can not define, but "Love" is something that we all in our own way feel.      I read an article today on MSN that had a women who had been with her boyfriend for 6 months and they haven't said that I love you phrase yet.  She was asking whether she should keep her silence or blurt it out.  Read it if you wish, I don't have the link but sure you''l be able to find it.      My Opinion is:  Just do what you feel is right.      When my husband and I started seeing each other I fell in love with him within two days at the most, but I never said a word.  I had already been in one of those relationships where I had loved someone and they didnt love me in return.  So I decided to wait to hear it from him first, besides I thought he was one of those types that was scared of commitment and was just with "the flavor of the week"  (I guess I settled down the unsettleable as I have said)  We never spent a moment apart and two months later we both moved together to where we currently live.  After we were together 3 months, a month after we moved here, he was heading out the door to work for the first day, and he gave me a hug and a kiss, then he told me I love you.  I think it is kind of funny now but, my response was: What?  He looked at me funny then I told him that I loved him too.  I never had to hear him tell me it though, I knew that he loved me, without a doubt, as I loved him.  I guess it is true, actions speak louder than words as I feel my story proves.      My point:  Love is a feeling, not a word that should be defined.
