I'm going to throw a bottle at them or just splash the whole glass of it. That might actually make me feel better and maybe they'll just shut up about it.  I know there doing it out of kindness and love because drinking it is very important after surgery but UGHHHHHHHHH!!!  Enough said!  Oh one more thing. Which isn't about water but why is it when they come and check on me while I'm sleeping, they have to wake me up? What the hell is the point of that?
