OK, and it suggests getting together with people to do it.  Like I would do it myself.  NO.  So I'll have to find some cool kids to do all the work with me, blah.  Today was my last lunch ever with Miss Carolina.  Ever.  It consisted of a lot of ketchup discussion mostly.  And why did we have Bio long block on the last long block ever this year.  Bad, bad, bad.    I got my award in History.  I was most consistent and favorite book choice for my complete distaste of my book review book.  Lovely.
