She took my grandparents to the beach, which isnt as normal as that sounds because they've been divorced and remarried twice, and now their both single and my grandpa's so horny that he wants my grandma now. That's a really funny sight too, because my grandpa can barely keep his balance. He staggers around, like one time he came to GrammaLynne's house and he was hug her or kiss her or something and he knocked over her lamp while he was chasing her around the living room. Actually that's not that funny, because everytime we go to Wal-Mart,  I have to go get the scooter for him to drive around, and last time we were there he wrecked the scooter into  my  car and now there's a big dent. And my grandma can be kind of crazy too, sometimes in a funny way, but sometimes really scary. She loads of fun to talk about hot guys with, like the time she sent me a valentine's day card with a naked man in it, that is awesome. Or the time she alked about growing pot in her garden just so she could try it once. But Lord knows, she drives my mom insane..So hopefully my mom will be of good mind when she gets home tomorrow. Maybe I'll take her to do something SINCE I HAVE MONEY NOW!!! hell yeah..
