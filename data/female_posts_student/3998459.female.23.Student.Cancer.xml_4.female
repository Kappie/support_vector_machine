It was SO much fun! He's the king of hedonism. The parking lot was the biggest tailgate party buffet I've ever seen. It was ten acers of kiddie-pools filled with hard liquer, wet T-Shirt contests, jello shots, pirate flags, shark decorated minivans, and so many CRAZY things! Some people hauled in a full tiki bar and like a 20 foot square patch of sand! I could not believe how many people were fans.    As you can see, Jimmy has a Taquila named after one of his songs...  Maggie and I danced and sang the bits of songs we knew, got covered in dancing drunk fan's beer, and smelled "the weed" a lot. I could NEVER live like that , but it's kind of fun to visit it once and a while a get perspective, or maybe I just secretly want to be a pirate... ARRRRRR! *Swash, swash, buckle, buckle*  Anyway, talk to ya'll later...
