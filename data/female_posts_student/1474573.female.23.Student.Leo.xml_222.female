I agree whole heartedly but before we continue I thought I'd take some  urlLink Nerd Tests   This did not help me in the search for Nerd clarity. So I asked one of my friends at MIT. We were in the same h.s. program. Him along with 4 other cohorts ended up at MIT. I ended up majoring in unemployment at the New School for  Social Research. Go figure... Here's what HE had to say..  Cassa: i've heard this a zillion times Cassa: but i never can get it straight Cassa: so i'm not sure Diane: lol Cassa: i think a nerd is a star trek person Cassa: and a geek is somebody who's interested in techie stuff Diane: hmm Cassa: but the nerd is more of a weirdo Cassa: and a geek is more of a technophile Cassa: or subjectphile  hmmm a subjectphile? So obssesive ness is part of nerd/geekdom  I still have no idea what a nerd is, however I did  up scoring Higher than Carl Sagan and  If you know who this guy is than you are in fact a nerd :) It's weird, i looked up and down for a good nerd definition and couldn't find one  And I have a natural aversion to stereotypes and  definitions especially since nerds are people who by definition fly in the face of those.  So how about this as a definition?   NERD  Though there are particulars to Nerd,geek and dork under it all is a just a group of people who dont' fit into whatever social rules they are expected to follow. They usually don't dress,act or think like they are supposed to. They are rarely seen as visionaries, simply outcasts. Because of a lifelong history of rejection, they lack whatever charisma they MIGHT have had has been killed and they are woefully sel-concious. They are usually obssessive because their ample brain wattage needs constant distraction less they think themselves to death. While Hollywood favors the science nerds, there are a whole slew of other nerds that rarely get mentioned. Take for example the ENTIRE slam scene :)    I saw the sexiness in Screech I believed in the genius of steve urkel (stephan to some) The greatest visionaries in the world were nerds.... If i looked at all the teachers that i've admired  they've all been socially inept on some level or other.     I've only been interested in people on the margins, they are just generally more interesting , however being different has it's price and those who embrace that have my respect more than anyone because that takes serious cajones...  So Dyanna asked me to classify her and myself Dyanna= Geek She's a loudmouth, she's opinionated, and she keeps it real. For as long as I've known her she's existed on those margins and that qualified for a second look and that's why i love  this girl so much. She rules in my book and she's a geek  extraordinaire. I can't share in her psychotic love for George Michael but I respect that she does it without shame. She does alot of things without shame and I respect her all the more :)  I? = Nerd-Slut.  I got this category from one of those quizzilla quizzes.   The computer geek with the penchant for S/M :) I am that nerd that those guys at Forbidden Planet dream about. I am that nerd under the guise of a geek.  I'm chronically obssesive about well..... EVERYTHING...  I was an eningeering major in highschool who spent her free time  reading 2600 magazine, synchronizing step motors on IC boards  that I etched myself with a program written by yours truly on an APPLE IIE. I made light shows with lasers and designed  cars to monster mash.  Yes... I competed in Boston University Peak Performance Challenged  and y es I still have the schematics for the car I built. My favorite toys were my soldering Iron. Know any girls that can hold a piece of IC board in one hand, a soldering iron in the other  and the solder in her mouth? sexy,sexy sexy....  I was president of the computer club and my aspirations included political activist/hacker.  The person you see right now is a brash, overly talkative extrovert  just to hide the paranoid, conspiracty theorist who sees this world through the eyes of George Orwell, Ted Kacyznski and Bernie S.  :)  I was voted most likely to shoot the president :) I am the most dangerous kind of nerd :)....... totally......completely....obssessive and crazy.  All other nerds  watch the fuck out :)  there's a new nerd in town   anyway....Nerd, Dork, Geek we are all hopelessy imperfect little creatures, each with our obssessions and  idiosynchrasies.  Be they Dungeons and Dragons, VB code,Fantasy Baseball,  taste in music, obssessive poets,manic-depressive, psychosmatic, bi polar or whatever they make us , us and negotiating through that space is what makes life important.  so? in the end.... who cares?  do we even need these labels?  No matter how we define them, they will still be derogatory in some form or other. Nigger is still offensive Spic is still offensive and Nerd is still offensive not because of how we define ourselves but because of how society defines us and while how we define ourselves is still important These words have a particular history to them and they've been coined by those on the in, not those on the margins.  As much as I've playfully embraced them in the end it's kind of hypocritical.... so lets just throw it out and be our crazy selves...
