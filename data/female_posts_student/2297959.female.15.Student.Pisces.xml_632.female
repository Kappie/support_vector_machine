If I don’t get my concert “fix” every month or so, I start to get a little antsy. After a show I’m normally exhilarated, all is right with the world, and I REALLY want some Taco Bell. I’m on a concert high. It’s got the same drawbacks too: when you start to really get into it, you begin building up a tolerance. You have to get more and more of the really good stuff to get the same effect as the lightweight stuff that got you high when you first started. It’s difficult to find a band these days that will really inspire me, make me believe in everything that is right with music and the human race, and win my complete respect and adoration. It’s just not as easy to impress me as it was before I became such a desperate junkie. I need something of real substance, of emotion, intelligence, staying power, relevance and truth. Enter Copeland to satisfy my craving.          Copeland is one of those bands whose sound sweeps over you like waves until you’re drowning in sonic bliss, or maybe more appropriately encompasses you like the smoke that is billowing around the room, seeping slowly into your hair, your clothing, your lungs, your inner being. By the end of each of the two shows I felt like I had made a deep spiritual connection with this band. Maybe it’s Marsh’s sweet, soothing and full-ranged vocals; maybe it’s the soaring guitar melodies embedded within the songs; or maybe it’s the fact that God’s presence is so clearly woven into the fabric of the music no matter what they may be singing about. Whatever it is, I knew that I had found something real those two nights, and, like a true addict, all I came away wanting was more of it."          isn't it the truth.
