At one point in the conversation she said that she was really glad he could talk to me honestly about things.  I was taken aback for a minute, it did not occur to me that she hadn't shared anything with me in a long time, a really long time.  Although most of what she shared did not please me I, too, was glad she shared it. I guess we both grew up and grew together without even realizing it.  Hmm, I guess I have sister, again.   It's funny we have lived in the same home for the past 15 years and have clicked on and off for nearly as long, but in the last few months we seem to have been drifting closer.  I care for her input, and although I've been telling myself its because she is shallow and therefore could judge how I look in outfit x or how my hair looks, it runs deeper than that.  I care what she thinks of her big sister and in some ways look up to her for the things she does (gasp, I know).  Now the question is: what is to come?
