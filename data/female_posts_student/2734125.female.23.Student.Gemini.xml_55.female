Twice today, maybe more, the world has almost faded out of being, only to reapear at the last minute, making a surprise comeback... but I was hoping for the fade to black.  Once you fade to black the lights come up, and there is a stretching groan from the crowd, and you can look around and try to recall who the hell your sitting next to, why they have their arm around the back of your chair.  The soda I just opening is making tinny pin pop noises at me.  Part of me is so dreadfully annoyed at the end of the semester.  I like the middle part better.  You are going, and you get in to a routine, and you read and write and it all fucking works and then there is nothing and you have to get it all done in a second and then its all a long heat, slow and burning into you, and things feel like they stop working, the heat jams the engines and you cant think for four fucking months- it is just survival and pounding warmth.  At night there is a breath, when you can stand under a different sky and talk out things that feel long ago under safe guarding constellations... but sleeping is hard.  It floats above you, never settles in during those sun days.  I woke up to a bag caught in a tree this morning, blowing and snapping and crinkling in the wind.  Before I opened my eyes, I knew that was what it was, but I looked anyway once my eyes were open.    Just thinking about what this is, where I am, why these little symbols are coming out... Maybe this is a confessional.  Maybe I am confessing to you, to the world, releasing something here.  Maybe the internet is a confessional, a receptacle, a containment unit for all the thoughts we wanted to say but didn't, all the things we wish we had thought but couldn't, and all the things that get tangled between that wet fishing line of lies that is life.  Maybe the internet is a brain, a seething mass that is the left over spuj of all the first world brains that have all the leisure time to think but never do, and all those dying thoughts that are bound to be pushed out by another burger, or some breasts or a shiny new something, flee their homes inside our minds and shove their way into a new reality, an ether that is and make a place there.  They shoot things at us, try to wake us, put us to sleep, drown us in wet sticky neon images- they are getting their revenge and trying to save us at the same time.  Not too hard to believe, not really, not with all the other things that I have allowed into my world, all the rumors and day dreams, the fantasies and fears.  This is darker then it should be, I'm not so much in this kind of place, haven't been for a long time.  I think that there is stress digging nails into my kindneys, and I keep wondering when I will be ready to get it all done, how it will all get fucking done, and there are things that I haven't even started, and reading and all this shit.  At a certain point you're too full to hear about it anymore, too full to taste it, you are saturated with this new thought and it doesn't taste sweet right now.  Maybe in a month or so crystals will form, delicate shapes made of thought, and will get stronger, a base for things to cling to, but right now it is just heavy, too much, and my feet are slick with it, and my tongue swollen with it, my eyes raw dryness with it, my hair matter oil with it, by finger nails brittle chips with it, and I keep thinking "I'll just take a break, go for a walk, watch a movie hang out read a book think about something else check my email fucking blog..." and then its just compounding.  I want to crawl onto my roof and crouch in the last of the sun light.  Have wanted to be there all day, and all day the bonzi has been in the way, and the spider webs on the window, and the desk.  GodDamnIt, can I do nothing?  I cant even beat a fucking little tree to get to the roof.  Fuck.  I doubt this is productive, but maybe it fucking is because I haven't been able to write for shit the entire month, which has never happened before and there is this weird fear that if I don't do everything right then I will never have a chance and I know I can fucking do it.  Why did I put off applying to schools for my masters?  I was fucking afraid I wouldn't get in.  I was frightened that in the real world I was jack shit and maybe I am but this is fucking home turf, I should be able to manage the game but I feel stunned, crippled, nothing to follow, new fucking ground and its not holy.  All these commitments, all this energy outward, and it has been, and its worth it, and I don't doubt that I will feel better and yes its only three weeks but really, come on, is there any way that I can do what I want to do, the quality I want to do, in this time?  Maybe, but I'm so freaked out that seconds and minutes are going by and I am still doing nothing but tapping on this fucking journal.  Someone is reading this and likely thinking, "who the fuck does she think she is, I'm taking time out of my busy schedule to read this stress rant, and she is rambling on about jack shit.  Why am I on this site? god, Morgan, shut the fuck up so that I can be done reading this piece of shit post, please."  Fine.  I'm going to get on that roof today, in the next few minutes if its the last fucking thing I do, and I am going to smoke up there, and try to look like a gargoyle and try to gain back some sense of superiority before I go buy something else and get cable and die old and fat and alone.
