Actually, we weren't planning to go there, only, we were too early in the carnival. We went there exactly 5:00 p.m., but the carnival started 6:00 p.m. So what we did was, we went to Jollibee to eat (of course), because it was the closest restaurant there, and we were so hungry. Actually, my dad just drinked beer, because he loves it.  Next, when the carnaval started, we rode the "SUPER TWISTER". It's a ride that turns around while it's turning around. But it was fun. Then Veejay and Makayla, (my brother and sister)rode the "CATTERPILLAR". Veejay hold Makayla, then sudenly she cried. We were expecting that because it was her first ride, (except the time when my mom,dad, and me rode the "OCTOPUS" in the Philippines, and my mom was pregnant with Makayla).  Finally, we rode the "OCTOPUS" (me, Veejay, And dad) here in Saipan. At first, me And Veejay was scared, because when we saw the operator turned on the "OCTOPUS", we thought that it was so scary. But dad asked us to ride it because we already had the tokens. So we agreed to him. We don't want to waste the money. Then when we rode the "OCTOPUS", we were really having a great time with the ride...
