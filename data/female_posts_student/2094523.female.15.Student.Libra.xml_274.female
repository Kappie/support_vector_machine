I'm sick of being nice to everyone and helping them with everything when they really should just go and fail all their shit because sometimes i am just frikin fed up with it all. The light isn't turning on so i live each day in the dark. I shall feel my way in and out of life. When people have opportunities or chances how hard is it for them to frikin take it. Why hold back on what you really want only to later find yourself sulking to me? I don't get you people. You mope around.. you are your own misery because thats what you chose it to be. You set your life and you set your happiness. don't come running back to me when you've failed.
