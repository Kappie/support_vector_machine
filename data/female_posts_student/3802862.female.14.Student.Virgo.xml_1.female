My parents are now talking to each other normally over the phone. They don't yell at each other and fight no more. I guess we've all really benefitted from my dad moving away. It was tragic that it all had to happen this way for them to resolve everything. it would of been better if he could stay here and live with us. Sometimes when we talk to dad on the fone we joke about him not being here and stuff. It's all weird.    The other day i went to John's house- which is mum's friend's son. and yer the cruz's and reye's were there too. We are starting to spend more time with John, Sarah and tit Liberty, it's most probably because of the divorce. See Noel is old and tita liberty is young and they were bound to get a divorce sooner or later. And now there's alot of gossip out with all the mums. Tita lib has alot of time on her hands now and is really lonely so she spends heaps of her time at other peoples houses. The other was the first time we went to her new house, she like called us last minute and was like dinner at my place. I don't know how john feels bout the whole divorce thing, i know my parents were about to split and it practically killed all my happiness and reason for living. No one noticed this because i was so good at hiding my real feelings. maybe that's why i can act?i dunno. even tho i dis like john alot i still give him sympathy cos it wouldn't be easy to get thro. He probly doesn't need it but it's there.    well i don't hav much else to say except i'm writing a story and i'm up to 4887 words. oh and we went bargain shopping today. oooo and i can't forget we're having a huge party at my house next sunday cos it's mum's bday and our house is getting blessed cos di saw a ghost.    neways more detail on that next post,    peace out
