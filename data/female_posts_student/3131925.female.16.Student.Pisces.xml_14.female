I failed my damn world civ final..how..i don't even know. I went to Clint's for dinner and we just kinda hung out and talked and..stuff lol which was really nice. 1 year and almost a month, how we did it I don't know lol but I'm really glad we did. Last summer it kinda sucked cause he had to go to Texas for like a month and he called almost every night which was good, but not as good as being in his arms talking about things from tree stars lol to us being together far after high school. After that I went home and just kind of hung out. Then Carlye called me and told me that her and Ashley wanted to go to this party by my house so they'd stop by as soon as Ashley snuck out. So at like 10 30 I hear all these knocks on my window and sure enough its them, so I went out on the balcony and talked to them and they said they'd be back in 30 min to get me, but I was too tired and wouldn't ahve gone anyways. Then 20 min later, Jessie's mom calls and tells me some psycho mom called asking where her daughter is cause she found pillows under the covers of her bed..so I'm like oh shit, Ashley got caught. And Jessie's step dads in the background swearing and screaming about god knows what and I told her that when they came back I'd tell them to go back home. So I waited till a lil after 12 and they didn't come back and I fell asleep. ALSO, Carlye is offically known as "the Devil" hahaha.
