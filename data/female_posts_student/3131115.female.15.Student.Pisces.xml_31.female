I fell asleep in my bed lastnight and Cierra was like in the crack between my wall and my bed. I woke up at 6:00 and looked at her and then woke her up and told her to move over. I feel so bad. I went on the floor to sleep, but I didnt succeed. Once I'm up I can't go back to sleep. I've been thinking about *you* a lot. I really really miss you, and it really sucks. Im extremely sad. But other than that I'm still insanely in love with Bill. I think he's coming over to hang out with Cierra and I today. I'm sort of excited about that. *blah*..I want another skin..I'm still not happy with this one. I guess I kind of liked the Rain one the most..there's too much white like we said but..I like it better than all Black. I want a really dark purple one but..I can't find one. *sigh* I'll look more. Anyhow...Im going to go now.
