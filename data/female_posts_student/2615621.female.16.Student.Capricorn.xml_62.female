Well i went to laurens house as i have already written in the blog before and we didnt get to go on our little "hike" but we sat around smoking cigs. haha we felt so badassed. It was a great moment. Catherines response..."omg how could you guys?!" and 10mins later "omg i wanna get drunk with you guys!" um hell no.   I read a poem in the school's new literary magaizine today about love. I thought it was 100% correcto. It's by a girl who was on the soccer team with me, Chasity. She isnt someone i would usually hang out with, but that girl wrote a poem that i really liked. It was about how if you love someone, you should tell them. If you dont u may regret it, if you do u'll never regret it. I've thought that for years. A line in it said something about yelling and fighting but still loving. It made me think of aaron. Ive thought a lot about aaron lately, maybe because i feel close to him now, and i never really did. Yeah, that's it..i feel close to him. Hes not much on the outside, but inside we really click. I'm glad we've both grown up and accepted each other for what the other is worth. He gives good hugs too...it's like his hugs arent fake, they're real. i like that. But aaron and i just sit around and talk about immature stuff. we mainly talk about sex. wow..surprised? nope.   Ben and Chris are leaving me. I want to go to their grad. friday but part of me doesnt. I know i wont be able to walk up to them and give them a hug and be like CONGRATS!!! *hug kiss hug kiss* because of everyone else around them and their family. I'm actually happy i have to paint as my exam with them this friday for drama. Ben pinched the hell outta my ass today. it hurt! haha i yelled ouch and he laughed and then hugged me, blaming me and chris for loosing his yearbook i never had. ummm...sounds like chris lost it ben. go ask him and stop fussing at me. dammit. i'm gonna miss them a lot.   I went to the dr. today during 2nd period and we supposedly set the date for my knee surgry, my grandfather took me, so i planned the surgry with the doc. I set it for july 7 with pre-op july 6. That is when he told me it would be the best time, because hes going on vacation during the last 2 weeks in july and didnt want to do any surgries the week before he left. i can understand that. So i was like yay i'll have my knee worked on, stay in bed for a week, and still have time to spend with my friends. i came home and told mom i had set it up...she of course said NO JULIA im changing it. ugh why mom oh why?! wanna know why? i found out im literally spending the whole damn summer with my dad. not just a month like i planned. fuck dammit fucmmit. WHY?! the dr. had told me he wanted to do it in july because if he had to do it in aug. it would be the same week school starts...mom said thats fine, i'll just miss the first damn week of school. thats gonna suck. that means im already doomed to take all my fuckin exams next year. FUCK. well maybe not all...but 1st semester is for sure. fuck. i dont want to go fight those stairs with cruthes and shit during school. oh well...i cried and cried, for like 2 hours. I just laid there on my bed with my head in my pillow letting it all out. i thought about calling lauren and crying but knew she was with hollis, so didnt bother. i will later though. i cried because i was going to miss the 1st week of school, that a lot happens that first week. maybe i should be happy i get to miss a week...but you know, that i means i gotta fight with crutches and stuff...i cried about that. I cried that i wouldnt get to see my friends over the summer. i cried telling my mom lauren was going away and i wanted to spend time with her. my mom said "well laurens not my child" and i said "i wish i wasnt ur child" through my sobs. Its gonna make me cry just writting about it. ...ok im offically crying now. i cant believe this. all summer with the people who keep me going, who keep me who i am. i'd go insane without them. i would have already moved to live with my dad if it wasnt for them. they dont know that, but its true. I love them with all my heart. they are my life. I can hardly go to the bathroom by myself, how will i spend a whole summer by myself?...i dont know. I guess when im laying in my bed during the first week or so of school lauren will still be in town, and she can come hang out with me and we can spend days together watching tv and me sneeking her pain pills. haha nice thought huh lauren?   Now that i have to accept the fact i wont be home all summer ( im coming back the first of aug.) i have to make something positive out of it. maybe i'll come back totally different. i hope so. Randy told me today i looked like a healthy ashley oslen. haha yea ok, thanks randy, but the lighting must have been pretty damn good. even though it made me feel good.   Oh well...let the good times roll... all that is rolling right now is tears and they dont make good times. i hate life sometimes. dammit.
