Why, ten years ago she was hypothetically the best ever; ten years ago I didn't know a word nor thing she was saying. Then she matured, while I grew. Still wonderful, and it's intriguing and blissful to run through it chronologically-and for the parallel rapport: to run through me chronologically. They were just words, just interesting words. They haven't changed. But I have. And my favourite stage is the intermediate. Why? I don't really know. The initial stage was just as intense though rather infantile. The latest stages were inspirational and resolved. Does this mean she's done? Perhaps publicly. Lord, I hope not. I get too much of a kick out of it. Too many relational possibilities on my end anyway.   6 years old- 20 years old.  16 years old- 30 years old-- do you realize guys she was born in 1974?  Wow. How the heck did  that  happen?   26- where will I be? What about  her ?  36- somewhere at least decently resolute. Will my handwriting keep getting progressively worse? How about hers? But I never saw her handwriting.  46- Let's call it satiation.  56- menopause?  Please  spare me? 66- that's half a century from the here and now, folks. 76- what an interesting number. Perhaps a grandmother.  By 86 I'll have spoken so much that my vocal chords will be fried. 96- I'll still jump around, maybe. At concerts. 106, I'll-- well, wait, I may not make it to 106; I drink far too much coffee for that. But at least it's not mary jane.   Mmmmmm... 2.49-am-rants. Slurp- too tasty.   All right. Onto chemistry- or bed?                               I think Shah was very glad to receive titanic amounts of attention (but he need not know).   --- But if there's one things that hasn't changed...                                  it's the  F  in my signature.       Oh, but I can't just give it all away!      My favourite.     " " by    Burn the books  They've got too many names and psychoses All this incriminating evidence  Would surely haunt me if someone broke into my house Suits in the living room Do you realize guys I was born in 1974 We've got someone here to  Explain your publishing We know how much you love to be in front of audiences  Hopeful you are Schoolbound you are Naive you are Driven you are  Take a trip to New York  With your guardian and your Fake identification When they said, "Is there something, Anything you'd like to know, young lady?" You said, "Yes, I'd like to know what kind of people I'll be dealing with"  Precocious you are Headstrong you are Terrified you are Ahead of your time you are   Don't mind our staring, But we're surprised you're not in A far-gone asylum We're surprised you didn't crack up Lord knows that we would've We would've liked to have been there But you keep pushing us away  Resilient you are Big time you are Ruthless you are Precious you are
