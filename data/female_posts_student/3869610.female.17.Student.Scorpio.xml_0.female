Summer is a limted time offerand i dont wont to spend it thinking about justone guy. sure, its fun being boy crazy and all but its alot more fun just kickin it. So im over it.  i got a new cd at target-Autopilot Off.I think its good, not spectacular but not bad. they were really good at warped tour so thats why i bought it. should have bought the new avril cd though, from what i've heard, that girl feels the same stuff i do, i guess its beacuse were both teenage girls or something.  Hahaha, im still grounded. its fun hanging out by myself.ONLY 8 MORE days, whoa....thats a long ass time.
