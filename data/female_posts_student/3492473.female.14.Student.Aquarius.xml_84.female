The beach was awesome. I had so much fun. Surprisingly, I didn't get burned. At all. Even after being there for 6 hours. I'm red around my boobs and my face but it's not painful. My back is peeling from the other trip to the beach but it's not like Tracy's! About Machy and Tim now because some funny stuff was said. But I just realized I said Machy was 6 in my last post, I forgot the one. Machy is 16. I didn't believe them when they said Tim was 19 because I asked him and he's like, "I'm 18..." pause "No, I'm 19." It was just weird, ya know? Originall, Tracy and I both saw Tim and we thought he was cute and we were gonna go talk to him but us girls were having too much fun. And then suddenly a very large football came and landed by us. Obviously, they did it on purpose because it was far behind the one kid so Car and me went and got the football and she threw it back to him. Then we started playing catch and talking. We were talking about lesbians and making fun of Carly for going to Beaumont. It's funny because they had no idea what VASj, Regina, Beaumont, and so was. We were talking about drinking and Machy was like, "You guys should come to a party at my friend Brendan's house tonight." Ha ha. Yeah right.  Like I'm gonna go to a party with people I just met and probably get drugged and raped. Yes, that's my favorite way to spend my Sunday night.  They were both really nice though. We were all playing volleyball but we had to leave so we said bye. I can't remember who but one of the girls wanted their numbers and  I was the only one with enough balls to go get it.  But I had to run which bothered my foot. So I got both their numbers. I just think it's funny I had to run after them because they were walking away. So then I came home, got ready for soccer, and left. I was talking to Carly about her hair because she got it "relaxed." Or whatever it's called. It looked really good. I had to talk to Mr. Willis about my foot. Today when I was at the beach I called my mom nearly crying because it hurt so bad. I told her I needed a doctor's appointment asap and that I couldn't run at soccer. So I told the coach this and he told me to come see a sports doctor at the football doubles Monday morning because my doctor would just say to stay off of it for 2 weeks. So details on that later. Then I got to dig up dirt to fill the holes in the field. But it was hard to decide what was a hole or not because the grass was like a foot high. Peter took the land mower and mowed "Peter" in the grass pretty big so that was funny. After that we could pretty much leave but people wanted to play keep away so they stayed. I would have played but I my foot hurt and I was like, "Ah, just go home and figure out what you're doing tonight." Annie, Reea, and Carly were at Chris' and wanted me to go but at that time I didn't really want to. I was in a really weird mood. Like I was totally confused about things and I thought I just needed time to lay down and think. So I came home and ate and just sat around for awhile. I was sorta waiting to talk to my brother. We needed to have a "heart to heart." It was very calm but Eddie got his point across  very  loud and clear. A lot of the time, he asks things of me that are simple but what we were talking about that night was a big deal. At that point, he was kinda telling me what to do and I was just like, "Oh, come on." I just wanted everyone to be happy and not have this problem. I didn't really say anything to my brother about my view but he knows I don't agree and didn't follow his wishes. Well, he didn't know  to what extreme  I didn't follow them. But I think he realizes it's pretty much up to me so he can have his two cents but ultimately, it's my life so it's my choice. Anyways, I called Annie and decided to go to Chris' so I got ready and went there. No one answered the door so I just went in the house and out back. Carly, Reea, Annie, and Urban were the only people there who I knew. And then it was Shawn and his friends. Shawn is Chris' brother. As soon I get there, Carly is calling Alex and telling him to come get us all because  I'm  hungry and wanna go to Wendy's. My god. The girl was the one who wanted Wendy's, not me! So Alex came and we went and got  Carly's  Wendy's. Then we went back to Chris' and watched Urban and Shawn's friends play poker. I'm not sure who won now that I think of it. I know it as between Urban and someone else. Eventually, we left, dropped Carly off, and the four of us went to Taco Bell, and then we all went home. I went to bed around 2ish or 3ish. I was exhausted. So exhausted I didn't even clean my room like I normally do on Sunday's. I didn't even do it today. Oh well. I'm gonna do another post for today so see ya soon! Yes and boys surely have an odd obsession with Taco Bell. Whatever floats their boat I guess. Oh yeah. An update on an old and current problem. Every time I eat,  I  still  feel sick afterways.  No matter how hungry I was. If I was starving or if I was stuffed or everything inbetween. And Tom Sawyer is a good book. I mean I'm not in love with it but it's not too bad to read after all.
