I dont know maybe eventually ull get sick of ure life being famous but i think eventually everyone gets sick of something. But when ure famous u getta be all u wanna be. I think itd be fun to see ure self everywhere, in books magazines, tv, movies, and then ppl recognize u and ask for ure autograph and then u feel special coz ure well known. Oh did i tell u that famous people get moola? yes lot of it too. I mean if u go to one magazine interview they give u a box of juicy coutures, food, lifetime supply of make up and everythun u want. Its amazing to be famous. Ure just jealous!
