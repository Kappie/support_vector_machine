Then after that I went out with...an odd but fun group of people. We all went downtown Naperville. Chris, Peter, Nikki, Becky, Lisa, Kathryn, Kelly, and me. It was fun, but I only spent a bit of time with them, because Brandon called Peter and asked him if he wanted to see School of Rock, and no one else wanted to go but me and Peter so we went, and that was cool and everything. Very funny movie. That was also much better than I expected.  But then, on the way out, things turned upside down and Brandon accidentally hit someone while backing out. Like, an actual person. They're not too seriously injured. I think maybe a broken leg, but gosh...it was just such a shock. Then Peter was a witness so we had to stay for a bit until the police said we could go. It was just really crazy and surprising. So, the ride home was a bit depressing but ah well.   Today was still such a fun day. This whole weekend without marching has just been so much fun. It's nice to have a break from it all. :)  I definitely need to go to bed though. I have a driving lesson tomorrow. Crazy stuff.
