Suddenly it all came rushing back. How much he meant to me, how we used to be (ok so we are still good friends), and how things have changed from what they used to be. Last time this year I was in my own house, which is no longer the way it was. Everyone is getting ready to leave it too. When I left I had a really touching scene with my ex. I cried all the way on my flight. I knew nothing would be the same ever again. And boy was I right!  suddenly look at me. My best friend teases me about me not letting him in my home a few years hence. He asks me whether K minds that he calls and hogs my time. I was angry at that but I began to think. Have I really become that narrow now? Have I forgotten my best friends? Do I want to continue like this? And my answer is a big resounding NO!  I like having my friends. I depend on them and being with K is nice but I cant give them up. Its like its two different parts of me and both are necessary for my life. yeast K lost his passport. Well he lost it sometime ago but realized it yesterday and all of a sudden it got too much for me to handle. Suddenly I realized that nothing was going the way it was supposed to. I wasn't supposed to be with K. I planned my life another way. Everything I think my life is going to go a certain way, something seems to happen. I wonder if its a hex that someone put on me. Probably the Batwoman back at home. I just hope its not contagious. K seems to have caught some of it though. Poor guy losing one's passport and supporting documents is a very big deal. I have suddenly begun to pray. I think its when you think you have been hexed that you hope someone higher than the hoaxer will come and save you.
