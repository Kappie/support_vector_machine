I began wrapping it up Saturday night and, well, I couldn't go to sleep until it was gone and done with. Wow...1000 words. It suxs that I have absolutely no computer paper in the house now that I realized it...NO! Oh well, I'll have to haggle my dad into buying some tommorow, ummm well today (I really shouldn't work into the early hours of the morning it makes al spacey). Anywayz, I need some much needed rest. i wil celebrate the completion of part  one of my summer english assignment with some peanut butter cap'n crunch tommorow. today. whenever the hell I wake up.
