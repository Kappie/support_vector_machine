And the guy goes "well leave out a bowl of anti-freeze in your lawn. Dogs and cats love, cuz they think it tastes sweet. And then they die. It's a really slow painful death, cuz you can hear them howling all night." and my dad said he was just thinkin' "how do you know this...?" wow. that is insanely hilarious in a "please stay away from my family" kinda way.
