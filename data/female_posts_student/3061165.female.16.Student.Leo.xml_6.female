It was a little troublesome but i had nothing better to do anyway. ^^  Well, there seems to be a problem about the pictures appearing which i am unable to help.. Sorry~ ^^"  Soon after, i had relatives visiting my sister today in the late morning. We hardly contact any of our relatives beside occasions like Chinese New Year and so on. Thus, I don't really know em much. And bout my sis.. She is okay now. Just tat she cannot move around too much on her own but can still walk like any normal person. After the operation, she had a height increment of 2 cm from 167 to 169! She thinks she's taller than me now... Yup, you heard me,  she thinks . Hee.. =p  Well anyway, they left at about in the afternoon at 1 to 2 pm.  During evening time, my brother came back home with his ex-girlfrend and other 2 female ex-classmates. Haiz! I dont really like visitors(besides my frends.. keke..) as i had to play host and serve drinks and so on. Meanwhile all these time, i started playing my PS2(Dragonball - Budokai 2). It was very hard and then i turned to - the cheat codes! I managed to find plenty of em on the internet. Hee.. Cheater Me(read Quote 2). Haiz, some games really hard to complete xia. Dont have so much time too. Hehex.. ChEaT CoDeS RuLeZ!  4 more days.. Haiz.. Seemed like forever. >_  P.S. I came across this interesting saying.. Or theory they called.  It's " First Praise Then Criticise ." Interesting and very true isn't it?    Dragonball Z - Budokai 2   Quote: Though it be honest, it is never good to bring bad news.
