It is always hard when we leave. It makes us sad to think that just to pop in would be a 5 hour drive.    We went to their church on Sunday.  It is called  urlLink  The Meeting House   and it is very differente.  It is also Christian but without borders. It is a church for people who hate churches.  It was still a great "Cool" service.  The theme for Sunday was the '60s... Yes, the Pastor wore sandals, jeans and a tie-dye top, but he does wear that every Sunday.  There was dry ice (smoke machines) during the praising and really funky colors thru out the service.  It was groovy.  His message was still heard no matter what.  He Has Risen, no matter where you were.  So now I am at home, Tylenol in hand with a chaser of Orange Juice.  The girls are next door watching a Tween movie and I will try to nap for a little hour or so.  So on this rainy, yucky, flannel nighty kind of day....... Be Good...atchoo
