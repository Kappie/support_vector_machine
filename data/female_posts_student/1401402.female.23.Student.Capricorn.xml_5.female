So, for all of you men who read my blog, which catagories do you fit in???  * The nice men are ugly *  * The handsome men are not nice *  * The handsome and nice men are gay *  * The handsome, nice and heterosexual men are married *  * The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men, have no money *  * The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men with money think we are only after their money *  * The handsome men without money are after our money *  * The handsome men, who are not so nice and somewhat heterosexual, dont think we are beautiful enough *  * The men who think we are beautiful, that are heterosexual somewhat nice and have money, are cowards *  * The men who are somewhat handsome, somewhat nice and have some money and thank God are heterosexual, are shy and NEVER MAKE THE FIRST MOVE!!! *  * The men who never make the first move, automatically lose interest in us when we take the initiative *   "NOW....WHO IN THE HELL UNDERSTANDS MEN?"  * Men are like a fine wine.  * They all start out like grapes, and it`s our job to stomp on them and keep them in the dark until they mature into something you`d like to have dinner with
