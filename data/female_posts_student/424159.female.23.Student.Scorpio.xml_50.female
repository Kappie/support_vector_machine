School is cruising by, work is fine, and my relationship with my roomies is much better (I could give you more information, but that might be incriminating to the three of us, LoL).  I get my income tax check direct deposited today, there's a goodbye party for Eric Saturday (I'll miss Biggie....  -sniff-), and i bought some new rollerblades yesterday (I kind of want to get back into playing street hockey).  All is VERY well now.  I'll be sure to come back and rant in a few days when my life manages to fall apart again.
