Not bad a movie but its actually quite long, about 2 hours i think. Started watching at 8.30pm and leave at about 10.35pm. The action scenes were ggoooodd, bringing the comic moves to life! Plus its also quite funny, w a few punchlines and even a dig at e comics and actors themselves... haha. Hmm.... would give it a 4 out of 5 ratings :p  Have a kinda weird trip home after movie... U know.... MAJOR deja vu! That kind of feeling you have... but can only say wat it is in french haha....   Was walking home from max's after getting CD from him, it happen near my house there. Noticed a lady standing near e traffic light apparently waiting for a cab. Didn't think any of it, just someone u saw on e streets. Well but after a few steps.... it kind of hit me... everything's familiar... like i've been there done tat. Next thing i recall vividly is tat 2 cabs (i even know its comfort cabs!!) appear and e one in front will do a u-turn and e next one will stop for e lady. BINGO!!! It really happen lor... seldom tat i get such such a "real" feeling... hmm.... talk abt alternative dimensions!!!  Wouldn't it be interesting if there's actually prove of alternate dimensions??!! E same u but doing different things at different time. But its really strange how we can get that deja vu feeling... or maybe there's really a matrix kinda thing going on in reality? Wah.... that's really something to ponder about! Haha....   15 bucks gone during journey home.... might be for a real need or it might be e cost of my gullibility... well its over... so whatever  Countdown: 7 days to Perth
