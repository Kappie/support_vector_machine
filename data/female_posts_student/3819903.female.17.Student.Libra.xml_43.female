So...I woke up, 20 minutes after it we were going to go...and didn't! So, what I did instead, goes as follows!   Ate breakfast, watched T.V., you know, was being my lazy self...then went to the bank...got drenched, and returned home to get ready for Hell.  Hell: Worked with Lili...which is always a blast!  And we decided that after work we were going to go and see  the Village.  So, despite bad reviews, and bad comments from friends...we went any way!  Oh my god! these people we call "our friends," have no respect for psychological thrillers!  These are the people that said Signs sucked!  So, the plot was good, the twists were awesome, and so unpredictable, and the main actress: Bryce Dallas Howard, was awesome, and a great first film for her!  So, Lili and i were officially freaked out, and we loved this Flick!  Definitely was awesome looking for M. Night Shamylan!  He's a tricky one to find, but its a good part!  Haha to all you people who haven't seen it, because its definitely a great "freaky" movie!  Then I went home.  And that's where this ends, so behind Home Plate Brewer tickets wait for me tomorrow.  That should be a blast!  watch for me on T.V.!  Goodnight!
