Here's to being 15.... Ya so anyway- Happy Birthday! He'll prolly never read this but in the unlikely case that he does it's here. I sent a present, and then a surprise present.. and I haven't heard from him, so I'm like...wondering if he fell of the face of the planet or is just really busy. Hopefully it's the second one.   Second order of the post  Updates. Which would be few because well, just because. I went to driving class last night and it was boring. The guy teaching it was talking at about 100 mph and I can only write about half that fast. So my notes had an amazing resemblance to this: Park curb, 10 inches, Change Flat Lugnuts, Drive. So I have impartial notes which is not ok. I think my butt was numb the rest of the night. I went driving again today! I did pretty well this time, my dad only gripped the passenger side handlebar twice. I like driving now- I drive about an hour at a time on country roads. The only time I had trouble was when there was a garbage can in the road.    Third Order of the post  Well I'm not sure what to do with this part. Lol. Well ya, Um... *HUTTAH* So, I was like *BAM* and then *HOIGHT* and suddenly I was here posting. *Yawn* I'm tired. Very tired. So I'm gonna go sleep.   I'm out like a turkey on thanksgiving day. HUTTAH
