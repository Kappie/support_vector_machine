I've looked at a few others, and it seems that the point is really to use it sort of as a journal, or to showcase your particular talent.  I'm going to learn to knit.  Maybe I will post pictures of my knitting accomplishments in the future.  I've wanted to learn to knit for a while, but never took the time to do so.   A friend of mine also wants to learn this old hobbie, so I think that we're going to learn to knit together.  Oh what fun!    This is sort of strange.  Writing these rambling thoughts on this "blog" which I suppose (if I understand it correctly) can be viewed by those who choose to view it.  Although, I don't know who on earth would choose to read my rambling thoughts.  Except for my husband perhaps.  Or perhaps not.  So, why am I doing it?  Why not, I guess.  If I get bored with it, I suppose I'll stop.    I'm dreading going to work tomorrow.  Of course, I always dread going to work.  Talking to superficial people who think that the world revolves around them and their mink coats is not something that brightens my days.  It makes me sick.  Regardless of how much money I obtain in the future, I hope that I never become like that.  That's not to say that they're all like that.  However, just one of those a day (and there are usually more than one per day), can make me forget about the couple of nice people that may have dropped in.    I can't wait to find my path.  I can't wait to know where I'm going, to be focused, committed to something that I feel is important.  Right now, my life is pointless.  I'm not making a difference in anyone's life.  I'm not changing anything.  I'm going to work everyday and helping rich people choose light fixtures.  I wish that I was one of those people (such as my husband) who never had to question what they wanted to do with their life.  I've been to three different colleges, and had three different majors.  I'm getting ready to go back to college (my fourth) and choose my next major.  I'm not going to allow myself to get diverted this time.  I'm going to focus, and I will not let any small obstacles force me to change my path.  I'm going to focus on the positive aspects of what I'm working towards, and not the negative.  I know that, that has been my problem in the past.    Sometimes I feel so old.  I'm 24 and I feel like I'm not living life to it's fullest.  It's all a matter of perspective though.  I'm living the life that makes me happy at this moment, and I know that there is change in the very near future that will make me even happier and more content.  Comparrison is so dangerous to your emotional health.  I compare myself to people I see on the street.  "She's so skinny", "she looks like she's got it together", "they're really happy".  Small thoughts disguised as observations that tear at my confidence.  I can't seem to control them though.  Of course I do it with people in movies as well.  That's when I begin questioning whether or not I'm getting the most out of life.  I begin to want things that are presently unobtainable to me; wanting things that my previous choices will prevent me from experiencing.  That's when I have to remind myself that I'm doing better than most people my age.  I can pay my bills on time (at least until I return to school.  hmmmm...), I have parents and siblings living nearby who love and respect me, I have a husband who is my best friend and looks at me as an equal, I have friends leading their own complicated lives that share their stories with me and listen to my rambling complaints.  I guess it's human nature though to always compare yourself, your life, to the rest of the world.  To always want more than you have.    I'm going to a show tomorrow at a local music club.  Jenny Toomey is playing.  I've never heard her music, but a girl that I used to work with suggested the show.  She said that her music is similar to Diana Krall.  I like Diana Krall.  I'm going with the above mentioned friend who I am learning to knit with.  It's something that I wouldn't usually do, so hopefully I will enjoy it.  If we don't enjoy it, I guess that we could leave early and go to the store to purchase our knitting supplies.  Hmmm. . . what shall I knit first.  I better start simple:  a pot holder.  Surely, I can knit a square.  We'll see.  My husband seems a little baffled that I want to learn to knit.  He said it's a stereotypical woman thing.  How stereotypical of him to make a statement like that.  I guess that I'm not what he thinks of as "stereotypical", but I'm not one to let the idea of being stereotypical get in the way of my interest.   He likes comic books.  How stereotypical of him.    Okay  -  so this is the start of my blog.  How fun.  I actually like writing in this format to get my thoughts out.  I used to keep a handwritten journal and found it very therapeutic.  Eventually, for whatever reason I stopped.  I tried to start it again a few times, but after only a few entries I would stop again.  Typing is a much easier way to get the words out of my mind.  I can type faster than I can write.
