(i dunno how to spell that) it was kinda sad that they only played one slow song, (which i didn't get to dance to, cuz i had to run arrands for my some what absorbed "friends") but that was ok, cuz i don't really like slow dances personally lol, um...ya...it was really great and now i'm looking forward to the next one, which is sadie hawkins, and i have NO IDEA who i'll ask, but i'm sure i'll go w/someone, i hope, otherwise, stag's not so bad either. and ya...i'll chat w/yall later, changedfish
