Again, if you can't wait until I make the site, my email is  urlLink melmel12889@aol.com !  To name the dolls I've been making, I've been using a place called babynames.com. It shows what some names mean, so I'm going to put up all my friends' names' meanings. I will have comments in parenthesis.  Jordyn - Descendant (of what? i have no idea...) Lauren - Crowned with Laurel (awwww! Lauren has a crown! she's a princess!!!) Tawny - Tanned Hide (poor, poor Tawny! moooooo! sorry, i had to do that) T.J. - A Twin (there's TWO OF YOU?!?!?!) Elisa - Consecrated to God (you go, Elisa!!!) Erica - Honorable Ruler (MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!) Jeff - Gift of Peace (i'm not too sure about this one.... LOL JK!!)  And my name!!!!! Melanie - Dark Beauty (how IRONIC!!! i'm not dark OR a beauty! it should mean pale ugly)
