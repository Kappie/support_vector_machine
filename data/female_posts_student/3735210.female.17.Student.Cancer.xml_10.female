     
      down to the earth i fell with dripping wings heavy things won't fly  and the sky might catch on fire  and burn the axis of the world that's why  i prefer a sunless sky  to the glittering and stinging in my eyes   i feel so light  this is all i want to feel tonight  i feel so light  tonight and the rest of my  gleaming in the dark sea i'm as light as air floating there breathlessly  when the dream dissolves i open up my eyes  i realize that everything is shoreless sea  a weightlessness is passing over me   i feel so light  this is all i want to feel tonight  i feel so light  tonight and the rest of my life  everything is waves and stars the universe is resting in my arms
