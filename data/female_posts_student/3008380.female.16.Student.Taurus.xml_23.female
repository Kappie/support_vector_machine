I went to Alex's graduation on Saturday, and for Wellfleet being such a hick town, I actually had fun. We went on this wagon ride up to Wellfleet Community Lake and it was so pretty up there. But it reminded me of Wrong Turn and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so now it kinda creeps me out. Still pretty though.  I got to drive GG's Infinity back home, and that was just plain awesome. April Morgan drove with me, and we had the sunroof open, windows down, and Murphy Lee cranked all the way to the top. Tell you what, that car has got an awesome stereo system. Geegers doesn't know what she's missing.
