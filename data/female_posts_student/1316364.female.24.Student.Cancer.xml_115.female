Not more then a ½ an hour later Jesse called to wish me a “Happy Birthday” too. We had a really nice talk and he sounded so great. He told me he was sending something in the mail and that I should be expecting it soon, for my birthday. I told him he didn’t have to send anything because he bought me two small rings, one with my birthstone, that I wear all of the time. He told me that the rings were nothing and that I would really like what he sent me. So I hope it comes today that way I don’t have to wonder about what is in it (because he knows that will just drive me mad).  Today when I got to work my bosses Kathy and Lisa littered my desk with Birthday Confetti and a balloon and cards and a gift. It was really nice of them to do so. One of my coworkers gave me a gift certificate for La-Bou ( A local Bakery/Café). This was more than I had expected from anyone at work so you could imagine my surprise.  Also one of my Aunts called me and left a message at work and I got several well wishes/emails from people in the FRG as well as one of my online chat/email groups.  Per Jesse’s orders I am going out of town for the weekend. At first I was very reluctant to go but at the same time I know the time away from work and my normal everyday stresses, at least for 4 days, will improve my current outlook on my life. I do realize that this trip has been preplanned but I wasn’t too sure if I really wanted to go a week ago, so per Jesse’s orders I am going., he says I need it.  At 1:00 they are having cake for me and then at 2:00 I am heading home to finish my last minute packing for the trip.   I have a good feeling that this trip is going to be awesome and I get to spend it with two of my favorite little guys, my nephews Isaac and Jacob, not to mention my mom and her boyfriend Mike (who is also going because of his birthday [which is on the 13th]).   69 minutes to go… till I can leave work.
