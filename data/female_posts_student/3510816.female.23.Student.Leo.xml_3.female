I mean, really, who wants to go through 27 cds worth of pictures, match them to the originals (which I scanned), measure the originals (which are really to delicate to handle much less take out of their little sleeves and slap about with a wooden ruler), find the correct file in the database (which I created and is, at least, easy to sift through), enter the data, and repeat upwards of a 100 times. I understood why I needed all of the other data, but this just seems erroneous considering how the pictures are going to be used. I hate busy work. The thing is, my bosses don't seem to realize that it is busy work. As much as I love this job and don't want to leave it, now that I realize that I only have a couple of weeks left until the grant money goes kaput and I have to leave; I just want it to be over already. Let me look for a new job and move on.
