What'ya suppose that means Buddha?  *hands Buddha the bottle*  Buddha:  *takes bottle*  I wouldn't know.  Sanzo's views are correct.  *takes particularly long swig*  Kuronue:  Oi!  Save some for me!  Buddha:  Sorry.  Kuronue:  S'okay.  Buddha:  But who knew that the highest priest of Buddhism was blasphemous?  And who knew a god would say that?  Kuronue:  Don't feel bad.  Buddhism is on a comeback.  Me, personally, enjoy being an atheist.  Baka:  *enters right*  Buddha, what are you doing?  Buddha and Kuronue:  Aw shaddup!  Baka:  I'm so glad I'm a Christian.  Kuronue:  Now, you're a Christian, yet you're sitting here talking to a god of a completely different religion.  Buddha:  Depends on your beliefs.  You see, she knows that I was more of an extreme follower of Allah.  I'm not really a god, but I ascended to a god-like level.  Baka:  This should be a sitcom.  Kuronue:  Hey, other people, come join the party.  Baka:  I'm out.  Kuronue:  Good riddance.  Baka:  Why I outta...  Kuronue:  Outta what?  Buddha:  Will the two of you be quiet?  Don't start fighting now.  Baka, go grab a drink for yourself and have a seat.  Kuronue:  Bring some food, too.  Baka:  Like I would bring you food.  Buddha:  Someone else can bring the food.  Baka:  *shrugs**goes and gets a carbonated drink**returns**sits down beside Kuronue*  When did we get bean bag chairs?  Kuronue:  Good question.  Lindsay:  Hello, this is just a cameo appearance from yours truly.  I would like to point out that I, like Baka, am a Christian and, while writing this whole thing, was thinking what it would be like if a Christian demon, Buddha, and an atheistic demon got together on a little chat.  This does not reflect my views on anything, and if that's what you got from this I am sorry.  So even if this has no particular plot to it, I have my own plot.  Fronkeys rock!
