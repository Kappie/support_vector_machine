Oh how I need a night out with friends that I haven't gotten a chance to hang out with in a while!  Oh how I need a daquiri and wine coolers!  Oh how I need a sausage on a stick!!!  :-\  Okay, that part is weird, but the other stuff makes PERFECT sense.  ;)  Things are going okay at school and work... I'm just really looking forward to Friday.  Thanks to all (Melissa especially) who have been checking in with me about how things are going.  :-)  Anyhow, now I'm off to bed.
