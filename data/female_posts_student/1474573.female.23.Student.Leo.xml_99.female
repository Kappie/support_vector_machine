My own personal fast      in the season to be eating i need to be cleansing myself of all the junk food i eat on my commute to work/ school     Someone should sue Mc Donalds because you CAN overdose on the mcGriddle, the breakfast with as many calories     as a slice of junior's cheescake with supersized order of lard  2.  Finish my website for web design      yeah.....it was supposed to be done last week. WHATEVER  3.  Write a personal essay on my poetic journey       .       done.  4.  Finish five poems in  Reflections on a gift of Matricide       Being in a room with my mom, my aunts (her sisters) and their children, I'll have ALOT of experience to draw on.     Is arsenic traceable in an autopsy?  5.  Cook thanksgiving Dinner      Yeah I can, I have and I will again........but fellas.....I'm not available and no I don't do windows  6.  Be wary of sweating the small stuff   and it really is all small..........      and remember those i love and those who love me
