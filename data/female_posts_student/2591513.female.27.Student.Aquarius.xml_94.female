I am feeling better, but still am coughing and I can't hear very well out of both ears and my throat still hurts, but hey at least my body is not producing mass amounts of yucky stuff.  I would use the correct  term, but would rather not gross anyone out too much.  THANKS MICA for the beautiful flowers.  You didn't have to, but it was a great pick me up.  Emily loves them too.   Okay better got to sleep and get this asthma test done.
