I want to be happy because now Neil cant hook me up with anyone and because its my birthday tomorrow but I am almost sad because the guy Neil wanted to hook me up with is hooked....But why am I sad? Today I saw them together for the first time and I was sad?!?! What the hell is wrong with me?! I don't even like him at all!!!! This is so stupid! And I had a chance to go with Neil to Value Village but I didn't go.....What was I thinking?! ARGH!!!! I feel so bad because I went and told this guy that I didn't know who he likes but I knew right and then I played stupid and he told me he liked me and then I didn't respond to him because I realized how big of a bitch I really am! So Steve I am sorry for last year when I told you to ask Jackie out because I was sure she would say yes but the truth is I just wanted to see you get shut down.  Sorry dude I am a bitch!  Sorry Matt for playing stupid and hurting you once again I am a bitch!   I found out a really good friend of mine well her Grandpa died the other day and I must say I love her a lot and I am so proud of her because she told me that morning and when I hugged her she didn't cry.  She didn't cry at all that day when we talked at lunch she wanted to but she didn't.  She didn't cry the next day when we were talking at lunch but she felt like it.  I think she is very strong.  I know if I found out right before I came to school that my grandpa died I wouldn't have been able to do it.  So Hun I love you so much and I am so proud of you and if you ever need anything these next few days I am so here for you!!! I want to say sorry to Neil for saying no today when he kept asking me to come with him to Value Village but then again he has Jessica to go with him but I am sorry for being a Bitch but icon I would have been horrible company today.  Sorry Hun! Spencer I am not sorry LOL you see you never seem to listen and I feel bad for being a bitch and I am sorry I do bitch at you but sometimes you deserve it.  I think Devon would agree with me on this one I feel bad for Jackie when you push her even if it isn't hard but I am scared that she is going to get hurt she is a lot smaller then you and sometimes guys don't know their own streaking.  So I am sorry for bitching but you need it sometimes.   I don't know who I missed for sorry's but guys I am sorry for a lot of the stuff I have done this past week when I was talking with Jackie and michelle after school yesterday I kind of realized what I was doing and I noticed how big of a bitch I am and when I come back after the summer I am going to be changed.  I am going to try and not be a bitch to any of you guys. I want to say thanks to Michelle, Rhiannon, Ashley, Megan,  and Jackie who have been there to help me realize this and For just being there for me to talk to when I need it.  Thanks so much you guys always make me smile when I am down.  You guys are the best people ever and never forget that without you guys being there I would be nothing right now hell I could be getting high with....never mind but still okay thanks for everything! I don't know what I am going to do about my cell phone.  I have told my mom and she said she will pay for it and stuff but I feel its my own responsibility to fix it.  I broke it and I should fix it but I don't know how to do it with out my dad finding out or how to do it without my mom seeing how big it is.  It really isn't that bad its not like I need a whole new phone or anything but this is just messed up.   I also have to find a way to tell my mom that tomorrow right after school Ashley and I are going to get our ears pierced and I know she will want to kill me but I am paying for it and its my gift to myself so I don't know what to do.  My life is fucked up right now my emotions are messed and well maybe I am like a Black Jelly Bean with no emotions? Later Gator
