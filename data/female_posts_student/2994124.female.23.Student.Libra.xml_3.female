We are hoping to be joined on board by another girl who has been managing the only Fairtrade Café in Birmingham since September.  She is now leaving there because of some problems there and wants to get on board with us.  She will now be our fountain of all knowledge!  The only scary thing is that as we discuss plans for this more and more, I also realise that I’ll need to find a real job then too – help! I’d really like to actually work in the café part time or something, but I’m not sure if we’ll make enough profit to cover that or what the others will think. We’ll have to see.    Have decided that there is no point in just feeling rubbish about something, if you can do something positive about it.  So I have written a letter to my tutor about the horrible mark and feedback I got for my learning diary. I have explained why I missed the sessions and also how I feel the comments are therefore unfair.  Wait to see what she says. But feel better for doing it.  Feel more in control, like I’m able to take charge of my circumstances.  Really feel like phoning Rachel today. Just want to chat. But I want to give her space, not appear too desperate or like I need her.  So I’m trying to ignore the urge.   Ok off to do some work – and I mean it today!  I absolutely HAVE to do some if I am going to be able to go away over Easter and not worry about it or do any.  Its really annoying that our clocks have gone forward because now we are 9 hours ahead of Vancouver, so managing to find a time when I can call Melanie and it not be in the middle of the night for her or me is increasingly difficult.  But only 19 days to go!  YYIIIIPPPPEEEE
