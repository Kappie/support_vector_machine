I haven't had a period in almost 2 years and now I've started to get it again and my emotions are hair-trigger and lean towards hating all things with XY chromasome makeup.  My apologies, I don't really hate ALL boys, I just want some good old fashioned lovin'  (and not necessarily even in the naughty way).  I think I need a girlie night out to drown my sorrows and share my triumphs over an apple martini or two with  urlLink Anna ,  urlLink Missy , and  urlLink Lisa .
