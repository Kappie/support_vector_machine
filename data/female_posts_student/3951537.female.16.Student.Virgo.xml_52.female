WTF?!?!?!?  is this children's entertainment?  honestly?  hi, kids, SUFFOCATE YOUR LOVED ONES!  ALL YOU NEED IS A PLASTIC BAG!  IT'S FUN FOR EVERYONE! someone please explain.  i am begging you.  if you want to know how this story ends, well, the dog good-naturedly let go of the bag and the dinosaur, amused, took it off of its head.  i am confused.
