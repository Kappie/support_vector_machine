His music is so incredible I hope this becomes a big hit... And I mean BIG! But knowing the stupidty of most of America, they will say "He's sympathizing with the Devil! I'm not going to Listen to that! Devil Worshiper!!" But if they would only open their ears and Mind, they would see that the song is another way of saying "skeletons in the closet" John said himself that "...Everyone has a Devil in their Wishing Well" I hope people understand that. I am almost scared of having this be the new single. But Good news Time!!            Alright, I found this AWESOME band, the Reign Kings, and I e-mailed Scottie, the lead singer, and told him my case, that being that mom would never let me buy a CD over the 'net, and yeah, and I posted on the Message Board a little, and Scottie e-mailed me back, saying the I was the fan of the month, and that he was sending out an autographed CD and Poster!! HOW AWESOME IS THAT?! And this band is incredible! He also said that he was putting in a St. Louis date, and he said that I had a "kewl" name!! This is soooo amazing! This sis why I love little known bands, they appreciate fans, they don't take fans for granted! I mean, even bigger bands like Five For Fighting don't take they're fans for granted! I am really happy right now, and I needed some more pick-me-ups.            See, Tony said that he loved me and that Christy asked him to block me, but after he left, she told me that he was the one that suggested that I be blocked, I'm just sick of all this lying. It's bull. HE sent me this song, Crazy by KC and Jo Jo, and I sent him Richard Marx, Right Here Waiting... That's Shawn's song!! How could I do that to Shawn? I still Love Shawn, with all my heart.. How can I truly love Tony with Shawn still there? God, a few days ago, Tony sent me All My Life, too. Right now is the time that I wish I could just delete Tony, and Christy, just so I don't have to deal with lies, and un-trustworthy-ness. God, I am sooo close to doing that...            I need to get a shower so I can finish moving into my new room. I slept here last night, And it was cool. I think my new room is going to work out, I can't wait to get my Autographed Reign Kings poster up!!! :)            ~~Breena            Maybe I can now remember that when I'm sad to listen to The Hoppity Song by John Ondrasik? No matter what, that song will make me smile, guaranteed ;)
