Anyway, I have my class schedule now.  I am taking child development my first term, driver's ed my second, and I have my favorite teacher for the whole second semester.  I am happy.  I found out that my ex boyfriend lied to me!  I thought I was in love with him (key word, thought) and he dumped me all of a sudden.  Well, I kinda figured it was for another girl because of events I wont talk about on here.  Well, I told him my suspicions, and he denied them.  Well, I found out that every one of my suspicions were and are true.  I think guys are soooo stupid.  They don't think a girl can figure things out.  Lol... No offense to all the guys that read this.  Well, I am hoping to find a respectable guy soon.  I am not desperate, but I am worried all guys suck.  I am very picky on what guys I like...  There are VERY few that I even would date at this point in time...  The ones I have a crush on, either don't know, don't like me, or are takin.  Like the saying goes, "Guys are like parking spaces....  The good ones are takin and all the rest are handicapped"  Lol, I thought that was cute.  Well, I am going to go now.... Peace, Jami
