Without specifying what time I would be leaving, I asked off. I just said I was going to camp that day. And a certain manager who seems bent on making my life miserable(the same one who cut me back to one shift a week) scheduled me anyway...for 10-4. So I can work but...I still wish that he had honored my request. Like, what was I supposed to do, just say "Hey, I guess I'll skip this camp that I've put all my money towards!"? I dunno. But it bothers me. So I drew a nice, thick black line through the next week and circled the word "OFF". I guess he got it, because he didn't schedule me. But, I get to work all day tomorrow, then go home, shower, and catch the bus to camp. Fun stuff. It wouldn't actually, though, be a problem, except that I asked off and gave a good reason. Grrrr...  So, another complaint. I turned 16, right? And my one year anniversary was earlier this month so, according to policy, I should get paid on my birthday. But...my birthday wasn't even in the newsletter. And I'm still in workgroup 4, with the 15 year olds. So, I'm gonna have fun with it tomorrow. I'm gonna climb a ladder, because i always had to ask other people to do it when I was 15(Chick-fil-a has a rule that you can't climb a ladder till you are 16). And then they'll get on to me about it. That will be fun.  Anyways, that's my day tomorrow. And then I get out of the house and Chick-fil-a and this whole crummy town for the week to hang out in the Rockies!!!
