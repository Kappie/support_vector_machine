Is there something that I do that people dont like, and they just dont tell me about? If there is, you should let me know, because I hate feeling like this. Especially when I have no one to talk to, and I'm just stuck thinking about it forever. That's never a good thing.  I just don't know. I don't think I wanna know. Please don't tell me it's because I'm 'emo'. I've hurd enough of that to last me a lifetime and then some.  I'm going to bed. Track meet tomarrow morning @ 7:30 a.m. See you there.
