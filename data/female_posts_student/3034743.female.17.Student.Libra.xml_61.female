However, it taught us that in tough situations, the ghost of Chris Kattan will save you. Don't ask. Haha. Oh, and I FINALLY figured out what Marty's GPA was! I was proud of myself! I don't really know why I would be proud, but yeah. Haha. Hmmm....not too much else happened today really. Oh, Jory was at the high school, and I didn't even go to see him! What is that?!?! Ugh! Oh well, I really don't care that much. Hmm....that was really about it for my day. Overall, I think I had a really good day!
