Then I try to set aside time for me to relax, after all, Sunday is a day of rest.      Moving on, what a beautiful Sunday. Sunday should always be sunny. I did go to church today. It was nice. I am finally learning most of the songs they sing. I do love the traditional hymns, but thankfully I can learn the new stuff and still sing some hymns at the church I attend now. After church, my mom and dad, Dusty, Leah, her Josh, and I went to brunch at the Harrison. Leah usually works on the day of brunch, but today she didn't so she decided she should go since she actually is allowed to eat instead of serving the other guests. The Harrison is a nice place. The old people are so funny, and the food is yumilicious. Once we all had our stomachs full we came back home. Leah and Josh chilled at the house with Dusty, Dad watched the Cubs game, and I talked my mom into taking me driving. So yeah, we left to go to Crown Hill. She did take some flowers from the garden to put on Marks grave. So I went driving for about an hour. I do plan on getting my permit Tuesday or Wednesday. That is only if I past the test. We did return home around 3. The moment I walked in the door I put some comfortable clothes on and took a nap. I finally woke up from my nap around 8:30. Man, do I feel relaxed. I still have somewhat of a headache though. I think the crying I did yesterday still has my nose stuffed up in there,lol. I watched some of the Olympics with my dad. People do have some talent. It is amazing and they make is look so easy. So yeah here I sit. My room is still a mess. I can't believe I have slacked off from cleaning it. That so isn't me. Maybe I will clean it tonight or just wait until tomorrow, who knows. Tomorrow, I do plan on going to the Dairie Queen in Clermont to apply. Please, I NEED A JOB!  So yeah, that is pretty much my day.      Ok, I am one of those few teenagers who actually reads the newspaper. I think I took an interest in reading it when I had the privilege of being taught by good ol' Mr. Nitschke. He was like the least favorite teacher at Eagledale. But yet, I liked him alot. I think I gained most of my knowledge from him. I am going to miss him while I am homeschooled. But anyway, while I was reading it I read something about panic attacks. I have known a few people who suffer from these. My mom is one of them. It is crazy when she has one. Her heart starts racing and she of course gets all anxious and thinks the worst about what is causing her to feel this way. When she has these attacks, I feel like there is nothing I can do or say that will make her situation any better. She has found some ways to calm herself. She does take a pill for it, then she reads her Bible. Seems to work too. But what I find funny when she has these attacks is she seems like she has to brush her teeth. I wonder, does anyone else who suffers from these attacks feel like they need to brush their teeth? My mom did say that I might have suffered from a panic attack when we had taken our first trip up to Kenosha. I had the feeling of not being able to swallow. So in order for me to not get so scared about choking, the whole time we were on the trip I carried a bottle of water with me. I felt embarrassed and felt like I kind of ruined the trip for us. I guess maybe I got a little to excited or just too nervous about our road trip. Who knows, but I do not like the feeling that I can't swallow. Also reading, they gave a good tip on avoiding brain freezes : To avoid brain freeze when you're drinking a milkshake, keep the straw away from the roof of your mouth. To lessen the already headache-inducing effect, press your tongue or your thumb up there. I usually find myself pinching the top on my nose or squeezing my head really tight. Let me also say, a brain freeze and a brain fart are NOT the same thing. It irritates me when people call a brain freeze a brain fart. Brain freeze is the headache from drinking cold stuff to quickly and a brain fart is when you can't think of what you want to say or what you want to remember. So those people calling brain freezes brain farts, are suffering from a brain fart. THEY AIN'T THINKING! But ok, I think I got the point acrossed. One last thing before I go, I got my homeschooling dvds. I have a feeling I will really enjoy Consumer Math thanks to a good-lookng teacher. But yeah, it is weird to watch the videos and knowing that is how I am going to learn. So I just count down the days to when I start, fun stuff! Well, until next time, I am outtie!
