Today I had safe driving, where, in my class, we did a quiz on safe driving, then talking about Constable Nolan's weapons. I got to play with real handcuffs and batons :P  Then I had stress management, in the most comfortable of chairs. Totally promoting sleeping. That ended 30 minutes early, so to keep us out of the hallways, Mr Hardcastle led us through a guided meditation. It was so relaxing, I thought I had fell asleep. It was delicious.  Just as I suspected, Adam is working tomorw after all, so I won't get to see him. What a surprise. Also found out that I'm working all Saturday, 8-6. Wahhoo..  Sad thing is, I spent so long on my hair and makeup and what I would wear for tomorw, even though I knew it was probably going to flop. I'm such a dramaturgy freak.
