I won 3 awards at school on friday, on for my poetry, one for math, and one for band.  I really like poetryand I have a knack for it, so my teacher syas...but I dont know. here, Ill write one here and you can decide.  Lady Fair  Once upon a time there lived a lady fair with gentle eyes'and rosy cheeks and golden locks of hair  one day she said  unto herself "my love life is askew!"  and so she searched  through all the land to find her lover true  the one who will be always there to hold her hand  through all the land  and let her know that he'll be there through thick and thin and wear and tear  however such a man is near impossible to find those kinds of men are perfect but they're only in your mind!
