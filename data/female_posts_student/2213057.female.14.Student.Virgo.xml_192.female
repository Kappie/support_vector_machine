HAH! then kristin rolled in dog shit by accident. that was hilarious. also she took off her shirt in the car and there was a whole bus load of guys in front of us. rachelle went home and kristin and i walked around. we sat down on a street corner. i went home the next day and showered and changed and stuff. then heather and i orgainized a party. bye.
