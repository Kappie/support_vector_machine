Today I: ran, took a bath, went to work, called tom to see if we were going to see shrek 2 negative, went to recplexx to work out, went to st. zach's parking lot to think, showered, laid down from too much thinking, went on-line, jon was sweet tonight he said he thought of me today watching just married he had good timing telling me that cuz before that i was just thinking of how it seems i was right that it seems like i'm invinsible now and worst of all, it seems that even my name is prolly erased from  his  mind. Okay, just saying that is enough because now I'm going to start thinking more and I don't wanna cuz my imagination is running wild right now and it's not good like Kev said I think too much, he's right I think..speaking of kev, we're good :-D well we were never bad actually cuz he said he wouldn't be mad at me for being upset but I still am sorry that he thought it was his fault I was upset..we had an amazing talk last night from like 12-4 in the morning, we were talking about the one thing we would never talk about in a million years: the time when we liked each other and how he's sooo shy haha, we also talked about hard times but most of all, the good times I haven't laughed like that in a while and he even was the one who wanted to stay and talk haha. I think talking to him and Ana have been the only things keeping me sane lately, that and memories. K, I don't wanna talk about feelings anymore or what I'd like because what I need in my life, is pointless to talk about when nothing's gonna change, I screwed up too much to ever fix it..."every wish i make will never come true"-fall out boy  This is where I say I've had enough And no one should ever feel the way that I feel now. A walking open wound, a trophy display of bruises And I don't believe that I'm getting any better. Any better. And this apartment is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence. Wandering this house like I've never wanted out And this is about as social as I get now. And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you Cause they would never do, I would never do. -dashboard confessional  I'm sorry I'm not me tonight. I can't fake another smile, instead I'm crying from fright. Tears I've tried to hold in come out when I think of everything I didn't do right. My heart breaks thinking of what I used to have, my life was a perfect light. Perfect till I ruined it all so now I'm as empty as night. Although I'm happy I've kept some good friends I can't replace those I lost,  without them, nothing seems right. -me
