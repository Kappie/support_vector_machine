So hope you all will continue to come and visit my blog here. ;)    Yesterday, I had done quite a lot of things.    First, at 1.00pm, I went to Jurong East to buy one Sammi's Singapore concert ticket from a girl, for SGD 150 for a fifth row seat. Ok, why did I buy Sammi's concert ticket? Didn't Iabandoned her and became Flora's fan, which is the main reason why I set up this blog??? Hehe.. A few days ago, I had seen Sammi's interview and special from the net. The shows are mainly a recapitulation of her singing and acting career. I suddenly realized that Sammi had achieved so much throughout all these years and this year she is going to be 32 years old. I am worried that this might be Sammi's last concert before she retires. And, I am very sure that I will regret for the whole of my life if I didn't go and attend her last concert.    I also bought the book   urlLink  Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown   . I read last week from the Straits Times, that this book is a bestseller for the past few months in Singapore and the story is quite interesting about the Catholic religion and crytology.    Then after that, I went to Causeway Point to buy Flora's second album to send to a friend in Malaysia.        Later, I went to Bugis to check out the place where I will be taking my GRE exam next week.        When I came home in the evening, I went to have a swim.        At night, I chatted on ICQ and watched the first episodes of two new TVB series; urlLink To Catch The Uncatchable － 棟篤神探  and  urlLink Twin Of Brothers － 大唐雙龍傳 . I think TCTU is veryasinine and funny, so, I will continue to watch it. But, the TOB is abominable. Idislike watchingshows where the characters have this special kungfu powers and can fly here and there. :P        After that, I went to read DVC. I think the book is good. Keeps me in suspense and will want to know why such and such did this and why this happened.        Sigh.. :( about the GRE. It is so boring. Till now,I am still stuck at word list 3. I really wonder how I could finish memorizing all 50 lists in one week!!!
