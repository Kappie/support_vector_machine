So I did some research online and thought what an excellent tool to have for communication while I am aboard the cruise-ship.   Monday I have my final interview for the first lady position and hopefully I will land the job and move aboard Celebrity cruiselines within the next month or so. Yippee. So, I think this will be a great place for me to post my journals about things that are going on in my life, places I am traveling and people I am meeting.   Happy Halloween, by the way. I have no plans tonight or shall I say I have plans which consist of not really leaving the house. I just want to hang out with Jennifer and throw water balloons at little kids and maybe throw back some beers. Should be fun - sounds as entertaining as anything else. Lord knows sixth street is not where I want to be. I did that last year and that scene was too much for me. Not to mention hearing about the urban legend of the crazed HIV person stabbing people with syringes of blood on Halloween.  That story still gives me the creeps.   SL-T Productions is coming along quite well - for those of you who aren't familiar: This is a production company that I have started with two partners. We are throwing a large xmas party in December at an undisclosed location. We are super excited as we now have an advertising exec, promotions person, catering, sponsorship from local businesses - everything is coming together quite nicely! It will be difficult to leave as things pick up but I am hoping I can persuade people like my hottie friend Shelby to pick up the front lines and step up the plate. She has great people skills and can seriously work with anyone.  My exboyfriend Jason emailed me today. Weird one he is. Never know exactly why we stay in touch. It's not like we are friends. Guess it's just that history, past that we still share in soe weird distant way. Gosh, it's only 2:45PM!! Oh my goodness another hour or more before I can leave. How irritating. I still have this lame office job until I get the final word on the cruiseship (departure date, etc.).   Okay, I am closing this journal for today - more to come soon!! Smooches.
