We came home, and I fixed my sister dinner. Dad was mad at her becasue she made a 2 on her A.P. test. Good grief. I got really mad, and felt guilty because I passed and will be able to get out of Freshman English in college.   I fell asleep for three hours because alot of my time this weekendhas been spent on the phone with Jason.  Ah... Jason. =) What can I say? I spent a couple hours at his house tonight. It was fun. He gave me a back massage which was nice... among the other things that were.  Dad talked to Ben's mom. (I threw everything away today, and I'm not going to take his paintings to her. screw it. She might think I did something wrong by doing that.) So, I had to ask him what Ben had his panties in a wad about. Apparently he thinks I'm going to have him beat up or something. Lol. I could tell that Dad probably thought it was funny. He kinda just blew it off. I think he's sick of getting phone calls about a bunch of bullshit. I am as well. I'm not going to have him beat up. If he does get beat up, I won't have anything to do with it, and I imagine he'll deserve it. (not like he doesn't now.) I am tired of him reading this journal, and I don't know how to make it private, so fuck it. If he wants to read it and weep, then so be it. I don't care anymore.   But this is all for now. I've gotta call Jason.
