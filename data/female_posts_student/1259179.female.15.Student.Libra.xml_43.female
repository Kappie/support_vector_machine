I want to start by thanking a very special yound lady who not only showed me her true colors but also that you should never loose faith in people. urlLink   Mollie   , thank you for this beautiful place for me to write.  I told  urlLink   Sandee   last week that I was considering closing my blog.  I didn't feel that anyone would actually care.  I was wrong. I love my look...  it is me...it is Lakeshoregirl...  The girls started school this week.  Only 2 half days, but still, schools back....   They even took the bus this year and like a new School Bus Mom,  I drove to school to check that they got there in one piece and not crying for me... Like As If...  My oldest was not impressed with my surprise visit..   Mom, you can't do that...It is not cool....    At least my baby was happy to see me...  I will get HER a nice car when she turns 21....  hi hi hi....   Anyways,  I will turn in now and catch you on the flip side so I am sending you big virtual hugs and kisses.......Be Good  p.s.  Love I have my favorites back...
