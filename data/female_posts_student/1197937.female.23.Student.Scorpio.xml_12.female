I didn't go straight home, but made a short stop at the bookstore. while there, my mom called and was frantic that i was still out and about at a time like this. apparently, while the national security alert has been raised from yellow to orange, my parents' paranoia beat it with a rise from red to purple.  my apt was completely empty when i got home. i may be one silly goose, but chicken i am not. for the first time since second grade though, i didn't like being home alone.  this is what occurred to me today: I am 22 years old and already living through the second war of my lifetime commenced by my homeland. that's not even counting the cold war. isn't it ironic how the two wars are exactly a decade apart, both against the same country, and each initiated by father and son? it's weird that i, queen of blase to all things worldly, am marginally affected by all this. but after being abroad and talking to ppl who aren't american, i realized that the problem w/ americans is that we never think anything is going to happen to us. did no one watch pearl harbor the movie?? and if a tabasco farmer can drive his tractor right into a pond near the washington monument, "one of the best guarded places in the nation," i don't think pulling the red carpet from the oscars is gonna do it. (of all things, pleeeease don't sacrifice the pretty dresses!!!!)  man, if bob were president, we'd have nothing but peace. this is a man who avoided service until weeks before wwii ended, and even had a wound to show for it. does that sound like a belligerent (sp??) man to you? i think not.
