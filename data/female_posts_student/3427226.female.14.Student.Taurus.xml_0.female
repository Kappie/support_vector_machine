Despite being the eldest brother, he                  not as careful as Tomas, his younger brother and has a tendency of being                 rather rash at times.   Hillary.T.Riddle: Tom Riddle's only child and heir, thankfully for him she is also the                   most loyal to him. Her lust for killing vampires developed when her   mother was murdered by Lestat De Lioncourt in a raid. She is highly skilled with the sword and is even better at curses, her main weaknesses lie in the fact that she drops her guard whenever in the presence in a good looking guy or someone she trusts.She is very good at her studies but the only problem is that she battle strategies only work in theory but not in practice. For a girl of age 13, it is a remarkable achievement that she is an Eagle anigrami.    Thorine.Jacinta.Riddle: Tom Riddle's wife and mother to Hillary, she was a patient woman                         who never bothered about her husband's affairs with other women. She was murdered by Lestat, when he and his band of vampires raided the Riddle's manor.   Tomas.M.Riddle: Tom's younger brother, and is obviously the more calm and creative one of                 the two, making him Tom's direct opposite. He was never into the idea of torturing vampires or any of Tom's "ingenious" ideas, in truth he was quite fond of vampires and was a close friend to Dracula. Upon discovering, that his brother wanted to use the stones to rule the world, he fled to france with the stones that he has stolen from Tom, along with his family, thinking that Tom would never be able of finding him. But he was wrong, within three years Tom discovered his hideout and murdered him and his wife, only letting his daughter live as only she knew the secrect to the location of the two stones.   Catherine.T.Riddle: Her parent's were murdered when she was only six years old while                     she was out at school. Her uncle then took her in and brought her up, telling her that her parents were murdered by vampires, when in truth it was her uncle that did the murdering. The fact that she is the last link to the lost two stones is the only thing that makes Tom keep her alive. Like her father, she is the complete opposite to Hillary. She is a crack shot with the bow and his highly skilled with charms and the transformation of various objects. Like her cousin she is a young amigamis and is capable of turning into more than one creature.   Count Vladislaus Dragulia: Lord of the free vampires of the world and the son of (Count Dracula)            Lucifer, he was the keeper of four of the remaining stones  including the most important one, the map stone which enabled the keeper to discover the location of all the other stones. By accident or by destiny he became the biological father to Kay, thankfully he somehow managed to hold on to a small bit of his soul, enabling him to take on the role as a father while being a cold-blooded murderer on the battlefield agaisnt the Wizards. Being a vampire there is only one creature that is capable of killing him and that is a werewolf, but the venom of a werewolf is good enough to render him unconscious while at the same time weakens his will. If given too much venom, he would become truly hollow and without a will of his own.    KalbÃ»ren Draconis: One might even call her the accidental child, as none ever expected    (Kay)              Dracula to have an "living" child, but none candoubtt her loyalty to her father and his cause. Her mother was able toconceivee her due to the fact that she was the lastdescendentt of Dracula's line and was a half-vampire. Due to direct orders from Lucifer to kill either KalbÃ»ren or his wife, he chose to save his daughter's life. The war between the Wizards and the Vampires led to her being sent to Lucifer for over ten years. There she learnt the art of controlling fire, along with many other skills. Upon returning to the world she discovers the disappearence of her father and goes on an all out search for him.   Cujo Erckson: One of the few vampires that can be considered as Dracula's true friend, he doubles as a bodyguard and a helper in Dracula's house. When the was began, he was ordered to go with KalbÃ»ren to Hell, along with the twins Geer and Veers to protect her if need be. He is the master of stealth and is un-matched with the dagger.   Geer  Veers Webster: Brothers in arms, and best friends to KalbÃ»ren dispite their huge age difference. To KalbÃ»ren they are just friends, but in truth they stick along-side KalbÃ»ren so as to prevent any harm to her. Dispite being over 30 years old, they still have a childish air to them.   Lesat De Lioncourt: The leader of the Rebel Vampires, he has been battling agaisnt Voldemort for years for the liberation of his kind. Now the battle heats up when he discoveres that Voldemort intends to use the stones to control them. He might be a murderer but he still has his pride and honour.   Ameera Raider: Lestat's dierect childe, she serves as is aside and is second in command in the resistance. She was once Hillary and Catherine, but after being sired she has gone all out to protect her kind, even if it means killing her two ex-friends.  ______________________________________________________________________________________     ~~~NOTE~~~ This story will comprise of MANY different stories, the main ones happen to be...1)Harry Potter 2)Van Helsing (movie) 3)Interview with a Vampire
