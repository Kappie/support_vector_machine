Thanks also to  urlLink Grace , author of  urlLink pulp , for her supportive comments.  Before I get on to today's business, I have to say three things.  1) Sev has tapped into my Sunday anti-fetish.  Check out his 07/11 post,  urlLink half-arsed .  2) Grace also tends to write long, but interesting personal posts.  Actually, I shouldn't say also. because mine just tend to be long.  3) in the interest of upping my outgoing links volume I offer you this gem:  urlLink http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2004/07/07/index.html .  It's probably only really funny if you are a nerdy lawyer-type or lawyer-wanna be.    okay.  Now onto the juicy of details of my latest random hook up.  See the next post.
