In all honesty, I haven't drank in almost a month, and I wasn't even drunk then-but I guess some of this carries over from my habits last year. Oops. Oh well. I'd kind of like to see the ranking of some of my partners-in-crime (you know who you are).    MEN!   Some guys are such insensitive pricks.  Sometimes I don't know if they even realize it. I'm not talking about any having to do w/ me, all is well w/ my guy friends/interests and I. However, I do have a couple of friends who are having issues and have talked to me a lot lately, and as for the men they are dealing w/, I have nothing but terrible words for them (the men-wait, no. The stupid boys).  Didn't your mothers teach you to be more sensitive? Girls, you have my sympathy. I seriously hope that these guys get their hearts chewed up and spat back out, like they rightly should.  That may sound a little cruel, but it is definitely what is deserved in this particular case.     Daily Summary   Meanwhile, all is well w/ me. IARF this morning, as usual, and now I'm in my apartment and wasting time, and considering taking a nap, before Bush Bash '04 resumes (my class tonight, not the primary).  It's freezing outside once again, but that should be no surprise to anyone.  My car is starting, and I got the locks de-iced, so I'm a happy girl.  My activities/classes are becoming a comfortable routine.  W/ that said I'm going to get even  more  comfortable, and go ahead and take that nap. More later!
