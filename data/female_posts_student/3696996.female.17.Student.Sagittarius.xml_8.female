They decided to have one tonight, tomorrow and friday too but we can't get a ride tonight and friday is sold out so I'm hoping that we can go tomorrow.I'll be so sad if we couldn't. 'm still wicked excited about camp but I need to go shopping maybe tomorrow cuz I need clothes and stuff. I'm listening to a band I've never heard b4 they're called "Brand New" they're pretty good, so check them out ppls. Now I'm listening to worms vs. birds by modest mouse, they're ok not one of my favorite bands. Now I'm listening to "This bitter pill" dashboard confessional, I love thum. (by the way I'm listening to lyra musicmatch jukebox, it's pretty cool you can play all songsof one genre and stuff) Now "blister" by jimmy eat world is on, pretty good....ok I'm gonna stop now, later
