Anywho,  skitHOUSE   is a random sketch comedy show. It has a couple of skit's which are....less amusing than others, but that can't be help now, can it??  Tripod are also featured doing a song at the end. WOOHOO!! lol. What else can you ask for??  Check out  skitHOUSE . Usually aired on Wednesday nights at 8:00pm, at least in Adelaide, on channel 10. Check your local listings to be certain!!
