The worth of our lives is judged in the end by the things we did and the time we spent doing them.  The great clock of life just ticking away every second of everyday, making each of us a day older –and not necessarily a day wiser.  Lately I feel like time eludes me, evades me even.  There are so many things I want to do; read –I have a stack of like 10 books and growing on the agenda.  Game, a pass-time that I thoroughly enjoy, work on my ever-needing web-site, write, do some puzzles, etc.  Somehow, in a day where I want to get everything done, I seem to get nothing done at all.  It’s almost like my days only consist of 12 hours instead of 24.  It’s getting almost depressing!  Everyday I wake up hoping to get to everything I want to do and instead I do nearly nothing and wonder where my time has gone. Though this had been my woe for some time now, in the last day or so I have been feeling a bit better about the situation.  I have had time to game and work on my web-site, and write my posting for the PBeM’s I sim for.    Now, when I wake up everyday I feel regret for the things I will not do.  The things I will neglect or push aside, I feel regret for the books I don’t finish –day in and day out. All in all, someday’s I wake up feeling like a total failure, before the day had even begun.  Depressing to say the very least!  When all is finally said and done, I hope that I can find a better use for my time, better organization perhaps.  Then when I am old, I won’t feel like my life was for not.  ~ Kristyn
