Well, there is nothing I can do. Bon is the one who told me that I can just let her stay in the living room, plus, I don't have enough place for her in my room. It's not just a place for Lemon. There was one time, he told me that I should move to first floor since I bought a lot of guys back, and most girls live on second floor!!! What!!! When did I bought a lot of guys back? And, there are three men live on second floor, but only two women!!!!! I am so upset of him! Maybe I will think about move to another place to live.  丁教授真的是超級討厭。今天回家來，樓下peter說丁教授不讓貓在外面跑，讓我放到我房間裏。我房間那麽小，怎麽放得下貓？其實一只貓是沒有問題的，但是我哪裏有地方放貓貓用的便盆。而且當初是小邦說可以放在客廳和廚房裏，我才答應幫他照看。可現在丁教授卻説不可以。丁教授實在是個很可惡的人，上次居然讓我搬到一樓去，說什麽因爲二樓住的幾乎都是女生，我常帶男生回來過夜。什麽哦！！！我什麽時候常帶男生回來過夜了？而且二樓除了我之外就只剩下一個女生和兩個男生，那麽幾乎都是女生！！！！白癡丁教授！！！！！恨死你了！！！！
