In order to be done birthday stuff for the fourteenth we will have to pull a total all nighter. Or not... I have most of teh stiff figured out. Like what we're eating and stuff like that, but to keep all the people entertained I need help. Now I was under the illusion that she was back on the tenth (late at night) that I could give her a day to recoop, and then we would go for it. But now I have to throw her right on in there. That just seems unfair.   So in turn, I'm making shopping plans. We'll head to radio shack first for the present, and pick up extras in the mall, my research dictates that they have the cheapest prices for what we want. then we will probably go to Superstore (becasue they are cheapest) for the food food, I'll see if Bethie dearest can get over it. And then there are the decorations, we can pick them up willy nilly. I'm thinking mostly at dallare giant they have good ones at cheap prices. And then I have to contribute, as well I have to get Cory's money and the stuff bethie had and what ever else I can squeeze out of others.   AND PEOPLE STILL HAVN'T RE-EMAILED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well I have relatives from Edmonton here so I must be off for now.
