Today all I really did was go to the stables at Willow Glen Equestrian Center and I signed up for classes to begin in August. It was  really  awkward because the girls were all in the office (the arena was flooded so they couldn't practice) and I'm assuming that they all know each other and are friends so I was like "fresh meat" being the new kid. As soon as we walked in the chit-chat stopped and the staring began. It was so wierd because my mom was talking to Shea so the rest of them just sat there staring at and, most likely, judging, me. So needless to say it wasn't the warmest welcome. Then I copied some papers for an article I'm writing on the Olympics that's due on Tuesday so I should really go and work on that now. Ciao!      Oh sorta P.S. I also got online and started searching for things to put on my t-shirt that I'm making so here's a list of my favorites...     Where there is no trust there is no love  Let the dead bury their dead  After a storm comes a calm  As soon as a man is born he begins to die  Beauty is only skin deep  Better die with honor than live with shame  Dead men tell no tales  Every bird loves to hear himself sing  Fools rush in where angels fear to tread  Ignorance is bliss  Life is just a bowl of cherries  Live and let live  Love is blind  Nothing is certain but death and taxes  The female of the species is more deadly than the male  Variety is the spice of life  When the ear will not listen, the heart escapes sorrow  Do not remove a fly from your friend's head with a hatchet  He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount  A diamond with a flaw is preferable to a common stone with none
