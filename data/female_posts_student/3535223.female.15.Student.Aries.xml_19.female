Well, since Katlyn spent the night I woke up and went to the gym...then I came home and helped Katlyn do her chores so we could "chill" like homie G's. ( That was a joke...) Then, we ate lunch together and then watched the movie Monster...( disturbing ) It was o.k. Then, she took her little brother, Baxter, to see Harry Potter...isn't she such a good sister.... She always makes me look bad... Anyways, then I sat at home and looked at www.avrillavigne.com and was totally jealous of Avril's career. She's totally the luckiest kid on Earth.  I won't go into that... So, then I just ate dinner and right now Katlyn got home and she's going to call me when she gets done eating dinner and we might go run or we might just sit and watch T.V. Isn't life just one giant gracious hairball? Yeah, I know ...we all live through them freakin' hairballs... But, my parents are hugging and kissing and it grosses me out beyond hairballs... I gtg...my brother has been putting popcorn kernals in the air vents...so I guess that means that I'll be smelling popcorn throughout the day. Families these days...especially mine...we are crazy...wait, I'm not but they are.. GTG.. Love everyone.. ~Lauren~
