Which happens to be a very good movie, even if neither of us has seen  The Bourne Identity . Anyway, I didn't sleep at all because I got home at midnight, and I had things on my mind. I went over to Sarah's at about 12:40 and stayed there until 2, then snuck back into my house at around 2:30, I then proceeded to go to work at that exact time. So that didn't leave me much time to sleep, as you can clearly tell. I was about to pass out at work, so I decided to leavea half hour early and get some sleep. I am glad I did, no one realizes how no sleep can drive someone crazy.
