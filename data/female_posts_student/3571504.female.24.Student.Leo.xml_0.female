I am going grocery shopping tomorrow, joy to the world, and I am going to get a lot of weight watcher dinners.  I think if I make a habit of eating those for lunch and dinner and not snacking in between meal times that should help.  I am going to continue my work out regime also.  Mother, if you would care to walk with me or do my "Pilates for Dummies" tape with me let me know.  I am going to walk regardless.  I will beg Allen to come walk with me.  I just have to keep saying this "I am the only thing standing between me at my weight now and me 50 lbs lighter."  I alone can do it.  When you think about the fact that you could do it alone.  You can be the weight you dream about, you just have to work for it.  It seems ridiculous that you haven't done it yet.  So I am going to try and keep that attitude.  No more cheating on the weekend.  I have to keep this a regular thing or else I will never get anywhere.  I am all talk now, but I have to see if I can stand the test of time.
