Everyone seems to be going for haircuts recently. Maybe because of the fact that school reopens in exactly TWO days. *runs amok* It's back to Horror Camp and I'm still so unprepared. Guess who will be welcoming us back on the first day? Cheah! *horrified scream* Lit with Cheah on the first period. Talk about Monday blues, this really brings it to the extreme.  It's been three days since the arrival of our new fridge but I still can't get over it. The elation and excitement of filling up the empty spaces on the cold shelves, deciding what goes where. I've been making more trips to the kitchen, just so that I can look at it's glossy white surface, grip the handle, yank open the door and breathe in cold air as it blows onto my face. Ah, but I'll probably grow out of this phase when my parents go marketing sometime later and dump in all the fish and meat, stinking up everything else.
