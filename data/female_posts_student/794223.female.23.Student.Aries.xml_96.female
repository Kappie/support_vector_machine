I never really did much in Austin anyway, so leaving the terrible traffic and just looking at sunsets over corn fields is actually kind of nice.  And everybody knows everybody else, and the whole town always lends out a helping hand when you need it.  So what if there's small-town gossip?  At least people give a damn if something happens to you.  This evening I went around the neighborhood with Brandi, and she introduced me to several 40-something women who all happen to work in the local school district somehow, having a party.  It was hilarious; they were all dancing in the kitchen to old 70's tunes, with this red-neck, foul-mouthed comedian in the background.  In the next house we went to, there were people of all ages, and when Brandi introduced me they all yelled in unison "Hi Rose!!!"  Welcome to small-town Texas.  Back in Rollingwood in Austin, it was illegal to have fireworks within the city limits.  Here, it's like, "Who cares?  We're brakin' out the beer and settin' 'em off early!"  I have no idea what we're doing tomorrow, but I'm sure it'll involve hot dogs, hamburgers, and the cheese from Vincek's smokehouse up the street.
