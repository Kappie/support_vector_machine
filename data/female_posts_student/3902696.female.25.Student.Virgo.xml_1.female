My long hair,  Flies in the wind,  The warm dry breeze,  Caresses my chin.    The glitter in the sand,  Shimmers like light on water,  In this open land,  Stand tall rocks that don’t falter.    My heavy eyes open,  The orange sand rocks I see,  This barren wilderness,  Is never-ending.    The purple sky shouts beauty,  A spirit their must be,  But all I hear is silence,  As the blood drips off of me.    I thought I heard voices,  Somewhere beyond the dunes,  But the whispers were a lie,  I spoke too soon.    Behind me in the distance,  Follows a red trail,  Surely my body can’t go on,  This journey’s bound to fail.    I slowly sit down,  On the soft sand,  My fingers feel sticky,  Dried blood’s on my hand.    Dark red flecks,  Cover my body,  Where’s the blood from?  There’s no wound on me.    My face feels wet,  I don’t remember crying,  I reach and touch a tear,  To only find blood drying.    I close my eyes once more,  Trying to numb the pain,  When I open them,  Reality’s back again.    I look around me,  Hundreds of people I see,  I’m back to every day life,  As I smile lethargically.    I walk in public,  No one really knows me,  But yet they don’t know themselves,  Who are we really?    Would I rather live with the sand,  Is that more of a reality?  Or would I want to live my life,  Where no one knows my true identity?
