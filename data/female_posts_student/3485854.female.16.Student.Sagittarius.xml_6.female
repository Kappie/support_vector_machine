When we're at school it's like he can't get enough of me, but when we don't see eachother every day, like I've said before, it's like I've fallen off the face of the earth. I'm no the type of person who likes sitting by the phone in my spare time. And he leaves for a week tomorrow. I f he doesn't want to lose me and he truly loves me like e claims, I think he should actually show it. Any takers? Besides, Damien is trying to holler at me and if Danny don't straighten up, I just might let him. Enough is enough, am I right? If Danny wants to stop it, he better let me know, otherwise, he's showing me that he doesn't want me anymore. Do you know how great it is to drive 90mi. an dhour on an interstate highway for several hours? Could have been batter, but I enjoyed the majority of it. If anyone wants any details, like how we ended up at Brian's house while he was still on the highway looking for us...and so on,  my e-mail is in my profile. I need to get drunk, maybe when I get paid I can talk my mo into getting something for me, I don't know, it's a no go on buying drinks for parties that aren't at home though, so she says.  This is just for you Leah and Kyle... How do you know she's a witch? (If you love you'll fill in the rest in the comments...lol    Joke for today    Three business men are driving through a storm when their car breaks down. They find a farm where the owner says they can stay in the barn with his daughter as long as they don't touch her. Well, of course they do and the farmer/father finds out in the morning. So he goes to the first man and asks him what his father does for a living. The man says, well, my father is a butcher, so the farmer gets out a butcher knife and cuts off his dick. He then goes to the secon amn and asks him what his father does for a living. He tells him he's a lumberjack, so the farmer takes a saw and cuts his off. When he gets to the thired man and asks him the same question. The man says, well, my father is a candy tester, he licks lollipops all day, so you'll have to lick mine off....lol.  Okay, I have to be at work early in the morning, so goodnight all Love, T.Y. Next blog may be a poem, maybe not, later!
