I already made the brownies but they didn't turn out so well. At 4, Nick and I are going to visit G Koski. Hopefully they can borrow me 2 slices of bread. I forgot to get bread and don't want to go back to the store. I'm looking forward to going up there. Then, Nick will  help  me cook for his daddy.
