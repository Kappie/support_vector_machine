Every night, he would look out the window of the apartment complex to the eight lane highway where he could see the tiny silhouettes of fluttering moths splatting into the windshields of the oncoming traffic.  Stan lived with a recovering alcoholic named AL. Last Tuesday morning Al's Jewish girlfriend Ruth decided to end their relationship on the grounds that Al's leg hair was too dark and thick. Al relapsed. In three days he had gone through 8 six packs, all of his remaining stash. On the fourth day, he stormed out to the nearby food mart to pick up some cigarettes and more booze.  an iridescent blue butterfly flew in through the door Al had left open and landed on the bowl containing stan's breakfast. Stan was captivated by the creature and followed when it fluttered out the window onto the fire escape.  meanwhile, al arrived at the store and made his purchase ignoring the cashiers advice--a keg certainly would've been cheaper. He drank as he loaded his Bud in the jeep.  the butterfly landed on stan's nose.  al started the car and peeled out of the parking lot. He startled two old ladies and hit a street lamp.  Stan sneezed and frightened the insect. It gracefully floated away. Stan pursued. It led him farther away from home than he knew he should be. The butterfly fluttered under a street lamp. Stan heard a rumbling noise. A semi barreled past and the butterfly was gone. Stan ran to the lane closest to his house and sat down to catch his breath.  Al felt a bump. He turned into the garage of the apartment and parked his car. Then he went upstairs and drank some more.
