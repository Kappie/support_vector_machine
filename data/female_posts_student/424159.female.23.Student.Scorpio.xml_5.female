However, I do know the signs and symptoms of love, and it's much like the flu (I've learned this primarily from watching others suffer from it).  You catch it unknowingly (most of the time) and unwillingly (if you're a loner like me).    To make a short story long:  I'm sick and I know exactly who gave it to me.    You know who you are.
