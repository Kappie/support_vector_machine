I printed out a bunch of info on automotive training for him, put it in a folder, and wrapped it in ribbon. :-) Also got him three car magazines (one collectors' edition) and a Jimmy Hendrix CD. The gift bag I got was pretty cool too: it was black and fuzzy with orange and red flames.   Not a terribly exciting day. I did work out for the first time in a while. Worked hard! Got some church stuff done and made copies of a billion pages of genealogy information I borrowed from Grandma Higgins. It was nice to be with my family for a bit tonight. I enjoyed playing ping pong with my bro.   Now for more of Taliesin! :-)
