All my friends could also see i was almost in tears and said that was a good idea... when we started to leave.. tyler asked why we leaving... i told him if he didn't know .... he was as stupid as i thought.... he had a confussed look on his face.. so i guess he is stupid... but the cool thing was... my friend chad... who everyone thinks is a total babe... grabbed me and pushed me up against tylers truck adn kissed me .... and held hands with me the rest of the night to make tyler jealous... i must have worked b/c he came up to me and said whats going on why are u holding hands with that dude... i was like u can do but i cant... he got so mad he throw his helmet down and cracked it.... he was like whatever u were never mine... all i said was ur right i was never yours........ but things have cooled down and were trying to be friends again....but its hard... but im cool with it b/c i dating morgan... one of the sweetest guys i know.. and handsome too.....%-)
