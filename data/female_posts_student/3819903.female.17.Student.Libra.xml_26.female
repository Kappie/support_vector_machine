Yeah, I've played Halo, let alone Xbox, 3 times, twice at Caleb's, and the third being today...meaning: I'm just learning how to control the camera angle!  That's what fucks me up! I'm used to the ghetto N64, where the you use your left hand to control the joist stick, yes i know you use your left thumb on the xbox controller, but the camera angle isnt controlled by that tho! Thats like asking me to rub my belly and pat my head...its hard!  So we played that for a while. The most kills i had was 4...says alot!  Then, for the second time today, I had Caleb tell me that girls are inferior to men when it comes to sports. ok w/e, i dont even want to get into that...it would take forever to write!  So I just went over to him and slapped the back of his head, and said..."well at least we win conference championships." and he shut up cause he's never been on a winning team before...and I'm not kidding!  hahaha, ownage! Dick!    So now i'm typing up this after a long drive home from kraus's dad's, and being the only one on the road!  Ok time for beddy bye!  gnite everyone!
