Not a ton of fun but it got me out of two days work and I got to meet some interesting people. Tonight is the night of our lives in that it is the Miss Ag Econ White Trash Universe Pageant. We all had to get dresses from good will and I even got my hair cut so I could have big bangs! The best part is its being video taped and then whoever wins has to wear the sash and tierra the next day at the ag econ picnic. The competition is tough so I am going home to watch the best movie around... The Blue Collar Comedy Tour. Its AWESOME if you love some redneck jokes.   In other news I have started a class this summer and it sucks. I really like not doing anything! Talk to you girls Later!
