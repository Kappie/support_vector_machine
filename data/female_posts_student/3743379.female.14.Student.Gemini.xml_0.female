XD   So we talked a while, then we played dance reveloution.  :D  I am horrrible.  ^=^   And then people started coming, so I stopped and we watched one of the dummest yet funniest movies ever... Monte Python and the Holy Grail.   O_o;;  I am still seriously cunfuzzled about stuff, but oh well.  Then we played dance reveloution again, untill everyone was gone but me and Hannah!  : D  She was taking me home, so...  they invited me to sleep over, but I had to wake up early to go to Michegan Adventured with my other friend.  *yawns*  Tired-E-ness.    So we decided to go outside and wet our hair with the hose because we were so hot!  ** :: see postponed note :: **   And then we started fooling around with it, and by the time we went back inside an hour or so later, we were so soaking wet!  XD  Funness!  So we wrapped towles around ourselves, and played flash flash reveloution on the computer, and then we got bored so we decided to talk again, then Hannah's daddy came into the room and laid pictures infront of Hannah, saying:  "Here you go,"   If anyone watches Frasier, then know its over :( .   But Hannah's daddy is really good friends with the guy who trains the dog, and the pictures were 5 signed group pics of the cast, and then 5 signed doggy pictures!  : D  And see gave a set to me!  *huggles Hannah*   She be so nice!  Then I went home, and narrowly missed my parents.  I was supposed to be home 2 hours before that... O_O;   Now today, I am waiting for my friend to pic me up to go to Michegan Adventures, a theme/water park.  Yaay!  XD  *falls asleep*  *groans*  to.......... early........... *yawns*
