I can see how it works out as punishment, but my mom says she wants me to take this time to re-evaluate my goals in life and to clean my up act. Uh... whose goals? Your goals or my goals? For goodness' sake. My dad says I'm grounded 'till the Hawaii trip. My mom says I'm grounded for a week. For the first time in my life, I actually want to side with my mom. But then my dad's catch is, I'm grounded 'till Hawaii OR until I learn how to play  Stairway To Heaven  by Led Zeppelinon guitar. Uh... right. I hope I don't butcher this thing.  Anyway, I'm actually really excited for this High Society thing. I got my skirt, I got my "accessories", I got my shirt and shoes. Flip flops, really, but hey, I match and that's what matters.That's not completely true. But that's okay. BAHA! I'm such a kick.
