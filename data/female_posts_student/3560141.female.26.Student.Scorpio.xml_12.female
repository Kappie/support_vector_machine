He says you live a life with qualities that I wish for, I close my eyes when he tells stories so I can drift away from mine...His lifestyle chimes with rockstar - dome, the likes of which he will never admit to.  He lives in a dreamy apartment in the sky and valet's his European sports car every evening after a long tortuous day of computer based work, meetings to discuss business ventures, projects with roots in many forests...His hippocampus works on overtime packing new amazing ideas into short therm memory that day by day grow into tangible be it or be it not gambles, he delegates his responsibilities only willing to subject others to work he would otherwise find himself overwhelmed with...he has gadgets like ipods, flat screens, watches that are worth more than my rent, credit card thin cameras...He has his eyes and his savings set on property he wants to buy, like instead of an apratment in the sky a condo in the clouds, he watches the market and knows the lingo, He buys a paper everyday, but he has the Sports Section memorized, he knows the words to every song ever, quotes great authors from the library of books he has read, can actually differentiate between a good and a bad movie these days, has been on stage with lines and everything, knows porn stars personally, takes golf lessons, did I mention he's younger than me... and he parties beyond what the average person would call a party (try impressing him) in deserts, on beaches, on boats, in a metropolis or in the Keys, in style with plush couches and bottle holders with ample mixers at his disposal... I can only assume as my life's shadow has fallen quite short in recent times....I listened today as he spoke of a project, one that would carry itself into stability, this project which could now possibly carry him to the verge of a bigger gamble, but a gamble with a wager closer to his heart...He could tap that well, full of creativity, spontaneity, full of those one line texts he so quickly sends telling me of new ideas I should write on, use all of that power (I sound dianetics - ish)to make a name for himself...He is never afraid of ideas....  Ok these are the tangible things I admire, what about the brain behind the He...He thinks for himself, not for others to notice, others notice because I pour the spotlight on his achievements at least within my circle...He is unrelenting when his brain is STILL in the mood, no idea is left unturned....He speaks with confidence, with utter confidence...He works the atmosphere, the person doesn't even know they're being charmed...His assertiveness never oversteps its bounds into cockyland...He will go up to two gay men in a city that is not his and ask for input on an idea he has for a gay friendly gym, utter confidence...He is never afraid of ideas...He will buy a crippled, lonely old man with one ticket to a movie, a soda and a popcorn...a heart with real empathy under the poker exterior...  He says respect amongst my peers, a worthy profession, a so-called talent for writing (I think it's like my pouring spotlight thing) or a creative soul, a high intellect, a certain likeable character (it's the people pleaser in me), stability...this is what he sees me as sitting in the lap of...it's funny how we cloud ourselves with pessimism.....
