For example, on this Thursday's episode of ER, Dr. Pratt and Dr. Kovac put an epileptic patient on an EEG to detect any seizures that she might have.   The patient had what appeared to be a seizure, but upon looking at the EEG (electroencephalography, mind you) results, Dr. Pratt and Dr. Kovac realized that she was having a pseudo-seizure. There were no spikes, etc. Apparently, she was faking it. I felt all smart-like, since I actually understood what they were talking about. These are the times when my love for neuro returns. And, from next week's previews, it looks like this same patient is going to undergo a psychiatric assessment. Sadly, I don't have the same kind of love for psych as I do for neuro. Shame, isn't it?
