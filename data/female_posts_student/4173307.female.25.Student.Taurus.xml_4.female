Isn't the Olympics so inspiring and motivating...I've been trying to catch it every chance i get....hmmm so its my break....and im broke...so looks like ill be at home reading or at barnes reading that lance armstrong book...i read a few pages and had to force myself to put it down...it was interesting...i have to go to the beach every morning and get all my workouts in at least...screw working...i wanna be a lazy ass for ten days......aiite catch yall on a flip flop....
