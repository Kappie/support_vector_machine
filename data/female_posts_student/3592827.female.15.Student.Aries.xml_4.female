And according to different sources, who know me at different levels, he's either a senior, a smartass freshman, a nice freshman, or a random movie star. I'm just going to refer to him as "Khaki". If you have any guesses as to who this "Khaki" person is, feel free to leave a comment. I might respond with something like, "heck no". But then again, you might be right. In which case, you get some prize or another... I'll think of something. Maybe a large candy bar. Nah, too expensive. How about a plastic party cup? It's red... and you can fill it with coke. You'll have to provide the coke, but I'll have the cup ready to go. I'm going to miss Khaki this summer... *sniff sniff* Summer! I usually don't have plans for this time of year, they just kind of pop up, like dandelions. And between events, I go into this wonderful stage called "hibernation". Or if the hibernation plan doesn't work out, there's always Terry Pratchett or Dave Barry to read.  I got a digital camera for Christmas. I'm going to have a good time at graduation. *wink wink* There's a kid giving away free kittens down the street. They're orange and brown and adorable and I want one and my allergies will reject it so I can't have the adorable, lovable kitty. *achoo!*  Leave me a message! I want to go to Cedar Point but I have no money... (This is only a minor setback. When I take over the world, Cedar Point will be mine! and Chinese people will be the most athletic people in the world! *insert evil laugh here*)
