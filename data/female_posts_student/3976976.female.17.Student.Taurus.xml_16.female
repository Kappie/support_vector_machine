To think that I had years to get to know them, but waited until they were gone to finally talk. I thank the internet so much because with out it, I would not have the interesting conversations I have now. The fact the they are not afraid to say what they think, that we have things in common, it just makes mecome to a realization that if you don't try to get to know a person while they are here, well, you may be missing out on having a friend. I am glad though that I never deleted the screen name and was able to find a friend, not mattering that we are so many miles apart. If only people here could cherish a friendship and realize that one day we will be going our own paths... they need to enjoy the presence of their friends now and be glad they are able to connect with that person. I guess all I want to get through is that I truly cherish all my friends, even when they fuck up. Realize your mistakes and apologize if need be, don't loose a friend over something stupid as being a fucking asshole!
