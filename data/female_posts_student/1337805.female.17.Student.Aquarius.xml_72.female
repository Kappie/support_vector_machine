This year I have a heavy course load, and the YAC, and youth group, and family, and work, and Cons, and fundraising, and me time! It's looknig pretty hectic, and to squeeze in, and be fair to have a boyfriend is just not possible. I tried it before. It's cruel. I mean, I'll take a fling now and then, but I realy think that something serious isn't going to be possible. And of course, I realize all of this after things become unfixable with someone who is willing to fling too. HEH. Oh well. In time. And hey, at least I realized this now, and not when I was in a serious relationship with someone I cared about deeply. I can be free with the wind this year, and I'm glad. And when I find that love of mine, I know he'll be waiting for me.
