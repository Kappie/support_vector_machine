I watched 'When Harry Met Sally' for the first time tonight. I deem it my new favorite love movie. Whenever I see a really good love movie, it becomes my new favorite. I change my mind often, so savor this.  Midnight! Its official: 10 days left.  It is so strange. When you are young, you look at the age of 16 as way off in the distance. You think of cars, boyfriends, and jobs. Ironically, I have none of these. But I have come to the realization, I do not care anymore.   On the car issue: I am lazy, so I didn't get my permit certified until June. Now the earliest I can get my license is December. But as of right now, I get driven everywhere, I don't have to pay for gas, and I don't have to worry if I am going to get pulled over by a cop. So life is good. What is there to complain about?  Boyfriend issue (or lack thereof): When I think of love *slash* boyfriends *slash* my-insignificant-need-to-have-a-supportive-male-presence-around-to-dish-out-meaningless-compliments-to-soothe-my-esteem, I go through stages. Stage one: Not caring. Stage two: Starting to care but pretending like I don't. Stage three: Really caring, and not hiding it. (For an example, see my blog entry from June 22) Stage four: Low self esteem. (Again, see that entry) Stage five: Not caring.  I bounce back and forth through this stages, and for a better explanation of the 'Not Caring' parts, I give you this: Sometimes, I get sick of what I look like, I get sick of trying, and most of all I get sick of my getting sick.    To quote Fat Bastard, "Its a viscous cycle."  And finally, the job issue: My dad, he is whipped. Soft. One of those guys that can't say no.   Generous .   'Nuff said.  But all-in-all, 16 is a good age. Two years from voting (WOO.. go NADER), five from drinking. 16, 2, and 5. All round numbers.   Wait.. No... not 5.   But it should be, its right there between zero and ten.  ****  Harry: There are two kinds of women: high maintenance and low maintenance.  Sally: Which one am I?  Harry: You're the worst kind. You're high maintenance but you think you're low maintenance.
