Attendees: moi. xtine. cass. mae. jamie. sara. monica. val. gezelle. clr. emily. lance. arcie. brian. jason. ig. eric. moby. stephen. lloyd. richard. gezelle's parents. Beginning was like sitting around talking. Walking on the beach. Was freakin' rocky. Woman was recording us. Freakiness. Then the "enf-ers" came. Pronounced: enphers. Huge ass water fight started. It was them against girls. Holy crap. That freak ass huge water balloon, lance got me first w/ that thing! Stupidness. Then more water fightness. Then it slowly trickled down to cass and I against enf. Holy crap. So out-numbered! 2:8?!?!? Wtf?!? And our weapons were like these tiny ass pails! And enf had water guns and water balloons. And after awhile, when enf were "refilling," cass and I stalked them, but they took so damn long. Then the second time we followed them, gezelle and sara came along. But then they left us, those ditchers! Hah, take that moby! Dogwater! Go cass! Haha. Oh my, what fun times. Sand castleness. Mine was so much better than gezelle's *rolls eyes* Burying-ness. "Awww"-ness. I bet she did like sitting there, can't deny it. My god. It's so obvious, seriously. Ice cream truckness. Climbing the jungle gym. Walkie talkieness. Sleepiness. He was a little too close to me. But whatever. Kits beachness was pretty fun and crazy, I enjoyed it..=). Next one = soon..woohoo!
