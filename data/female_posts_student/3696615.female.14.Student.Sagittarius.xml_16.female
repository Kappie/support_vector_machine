Our neighbor and her daughter are over here doing something, and I'd rather not talk to them. We'll be there for 5 days, but it will take us 3 days to drive up there, and 3 days to drive back. My sister will be driving back down with us.   Woohoo, are  they gone.  I heard "bye"  Hmmm...  perhaps I shall venture out into the wild >_0
