That usually only happens when I extremely happy or really depressed (as in depressed, not sad) and I'm really not either right now.  I mean, I'm happiER, but not HAPPY exactly.  I've had too many fights with Mamita to actually be HAPPY.  But I'm definitely not even close to a little bit sad.  Or mad.  Or whatever.  I just want to play the freaking piano.  ALL the time.  Literally, I've been on it almost five hours and then I come in here and work on homework or post on the blog or eat when my arms get to tired to hold their own weight.  I have really low blood pressure.  110/70.  Isn't that weird?  Rosie should understand that one.
