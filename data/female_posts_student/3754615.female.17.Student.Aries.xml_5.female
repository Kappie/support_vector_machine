Everyones so cought up in stupid politics and pritty much all that matters is what the fucken leaders say... Id like to ask you, how many americans agree with Bush? last i herd 70% of em voted againsthis desisions! no lie. That is so pathetic, Bush doesent know what the hell hes doing. War doesnt solve shit! ... but what the hell, we all know this. so why am i talking about it.? screw that. lol.The funny thing is i used to hate america, and the americans, but i guess i canged my view.. sorta... the U.S. might be the stronget country in the world, but they cant stay like that forever, i think all this war is gonna tear them apart, eaither that or they need to get bush they fuck out of there. .. yeah.. i thought i said i would stop tlaking about this! lol y dont i just stop talking all together lol
