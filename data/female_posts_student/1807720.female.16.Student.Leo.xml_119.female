I NEED my graphing calculator for tommorow because a normal calculator can't calc. any mortgage questions. But hopefully Lawrence just accidently took it or something, or maybe I just forgot it in her room or something.  I HOPE!  And well tonight to review for my math test I am going to have to go over my notes and use those as practice cause I have no text at the moment.  I am VERY responsible though and it seems strange that I wouldn't have it but I am not going to worry too much about it.  I understand my Chem. a little more.  Mrs. J also talked to me a little bit today, and she is like my favourite person in the entire world to talk to.  She is so awesome and like one of the best teacher's I have ever met, and like really cares about people.  I feel like things are starting to go my way.  I still have alot of things on my plate though, I have the math test, the chem re-write, the Chem project, the religion tests, my project and M.C. for the rel. final, and the next chapter 9 pt. 2 test next week.  Yeah it's alot.  But I CAN do it.
