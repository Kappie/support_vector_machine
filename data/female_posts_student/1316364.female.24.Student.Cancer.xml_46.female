The course in on Family Childcare and I have been looking forward to this class all semester.  In other news, I continue to chat with Jesse just about every day.  I found out that my phone, which has wireless internet, can log into yahoo messenger so if I am in route from point A to point B I can always log in there and talk to him through my phone.  It is really a neat thing the thing they call technology.  :-)   Monday is Jesse and Mine 1 year wedding anniversary.  I am not really looking forward to it.  I was hoping that I could just not wake up, but that wont happen.  Jesse said that he would call me; I think we need to talk to each other on our day.  I really hate that he has to be away on our anniversary but I know that he is needed where he is.  He and the rest of his unit are very important to the war effort, and I know that.  Every so often the selfishness peeks through and shows its ugly little face, and I guess today is one of those days.  I just miss him more with each passing day, sometimes I wish I could pinch myself and all of this would just go away like a bad dream, but all I wind up with is a sore spot on my arm and the realization that my bad dream is real life.  I just always hate missing my best friend, especially when he is Â½ way across the world.
