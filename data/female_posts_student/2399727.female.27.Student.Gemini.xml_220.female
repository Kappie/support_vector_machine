I'm neither a true and whole member of the sighted community nor am I "bad" enough to be a fully-fledged member of the blind community.  I don't know where to park myself, so to speak.  I think that is a key part of this recent identity crisis.   My grades from the second term test were posted today.  89% total.  Better than I thought given my predilection of massacring one of the questions.  If I do about the same on the third test July 21, I will only need 50% on the final exam in order to pass the course.  That sort of average serves to calm me down.   Good visit with a different neurologist yesterday.  He has me on $500 worth of drugs (that's the cost for just a month! thank goodness for insurance) to see if that will help.  More to come...
