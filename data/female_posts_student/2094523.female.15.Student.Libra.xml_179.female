I hate it when peopel have mood swings. people must hate me and i sure dont blame them. not one bit. rite now im like lightheaded and dizzy and emotionally mixed. i have absolutely no clue why. its not happiness, its not love, its not hate, its not school, its not friends.. .ooh i get it.. I MUST BE PREGNANT.
