She went to harvard and university of maryland, two schools i am very interested in, and was able to give me a good perspective as a student athlete. I am very lucky to have her as a resource. That afternoon, Dr. Richmond gave me some of the data he collected from observing the star that i found to be varying. I made a graph using this data, and it again showed variability throughout the night in the magnitude of the star. Dr. Richomd suspects that this might be due to an issue of color. If this star happens to be a different color star then the other stars around it, the results might be skewed. Dr. Richmond is going to check this soon, so i may know whether or not this star is normal or really a variable star. I won't be back into work until the 11th- vacation time!!!
