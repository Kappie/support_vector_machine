Here's one I prepared earlier:       But if my method isn't working... urlLink check Courtney's out.     ---   Do we prefer our musicians to be arrogant, conceited drug addicts? I mean, really, can you think of one 'rcokstar' of note with a polite, lovely and generally palattable attitude? Or would that make them too 'boring' or 'weird', not in keeping with the societal idea of 'the rockstar'? The rockstar, after all,  has   to get drunk,  has   to insult other bands in order to  be   a rockstar. Rockstars, too, are allowed to do things we plebians aren't. Many perform drunk, half asleep or just plain badly, and are still revered as genius. But really, if it were any other way, everyone would be a rockstar and there'd be no societal division between those of us who  are   and those of us who  aren't .   Besides, I don't think the public would buy the album of a band whose songs go something like this:  "The world is so beautiful/Let's all dance around in a circle/Hold hands and pick flowers"   , and whose idea of 'rocking out' is  cleaning   the instruments insteading of smashing them.
