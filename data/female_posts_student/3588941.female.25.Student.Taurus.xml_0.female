It unfits them for the regular duties of life. It renders them restless and impatient of proper restraint. It obstructs business. It tends to contract habits of dissipation. It throws our young folks into the company of persons whose society should be shunned. It cultivates worldliness. It conduces to many evils, and the spirit of purity, temperance, holiness and peace will not abide..."  Our society is based so much on amusement and (instant) gratification. We have a false sense of deservedness that causes us to strive for happiness through attainment of wealth, possessions, and etc. As a byproduct, our country is overwhelming debt. Recently, I heard figures of around 26 or 28 thousand dollars per household average debt rate, not including mortgage. I can only say one thing about that… sick. What are we thinking!?  Why do we deserve so much that we put ourselves, and other through the general economy (who pays the debt when we can’t, ie bankruptcy), at such great risk!?  I know that there are a great number of problems in this world. And in my person opinion, I believe each us, individually, could fix a great majority of them, if the efforts were made to live with a love for others rather than ourselves. This grandiose statement reminds of another quote that was used by a good friend of mine…  "Only he who attempts the absurd is capable of achieving the impossible!"   some more thoughts along these lines, go to  urlLink www.zaadz.com
