Fine, so I've cursed it a lot over the years, but still...  *sighs*  I'll still be able to get online I think. I'm going to borrow a PC card and can hopefully get online in my dorm room.  Yes, time will fly. 5 weeks will be soon over. Ahhhh.  I'll see you guys later. Call me if I've disappeared for more than a few days. =P
