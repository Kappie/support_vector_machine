We know it, we accept it, but sometimes we do forget it. That is, until some construction worker pulls up next to our vehicle so he can make googly eyes at us while driving 45 mph.   This afternoon my daughter (whose name would translate to  Kalala --seems a bit much)  and I were on our way home, having just left the drive-through, when a white construction truck in the lane next to me pulls up right beside my own car. His window is down, as is my passenger window, and he proceeds to make a series of faces at me, starting with the universal gesture that means "What's up, Hot Stuff": the nod. Meanwhile, I am trying to take in the fact that this man is seriously imagining whatever boys imagine when they road-stalk girls on four lane highways, and wondering how it could be that this person had the idea to hit on me while I'm minding my own business, eating my lunch in the car.  Oooh, Baby, I love the way you bite into your Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich. Spill that iced tea in your lap one more time for me please, will ya?  Did he completely ignore the two year old in the back seat who was screaming that her chicken needed jelly?   Every time I slowed down, so did he. I sped up, so did he. I actually have a theory about this kind of male behavior that is not so humorous, and a lot more "angry feminist," but I don't want to reveal my true colors just yet. ;-)
