I've just been slacking lol. I don't remember it all of course, so I'm going to kind of summarize it. It's been crazy up and down with me and Tyler, and our status now? I have no clue. I talked to him a little tonight, and it was happy talking...but that still doesn't make me understand anything any better. He knows what I want...who doesn't? Don't know if I'll get it though. Suppose only time can tell. Some crazy things happened today though. At around 4 or so my mom and step-dad went to play tennis...nothing out of the ordinary...but then we stopped by my Grandma's house on our way to Casey and there was a strange child in her living room, just watching TV. It confused me, so of course I asked. Apparently he was fetching their tennis balls for them when they were playing, so they took him to DQ for some ice cream and then went to my grandma's to hang out for a while. That was kind of strange but then I didn't think anything of it. So, anyways we left and went to Caleb's house where we watched a bit of Fern Gully and then played tag with the hacky sack...yea I don't recommend it. I got pegged in the face, back, and leg by Rieman and once in the arm by Caleb...I get the feeling tomorrow I'll wake up with some bruises. Anyways, we left Caleb's after about an hour and went to Bub's house, where Caleb worked on his bike for about 5 minutes and then Bub showed up and so we chilled in the garage for a while before going over to the tennis court across the road. After hanging out there and the boys getting hit on by some nasty girls, we got kicked out by some adults I assumed to be the owners. Oh well, so we went back and chilled in his garage a little more then came home. This is the new picture, its about 11 o'clock...I walk in the door...my step-dad's asleep in a chair and my mom on the couch, nothing new. So I look in the other chair...and there he is. That same boy, I'm beginning to think we've adopted him lol. No, just kidding. So anyways it leads me here to about 3 a.m...and he's about 20 feet behind me settled on the couch watching cartoons...AWAKE...small children aren't supposed to be awake at such hours, but what am I to do but cater his every service. I've been bringing him pop tarts and soda and anything else he needs. I feel like a mom...hope I get payed for this...oh well. But that's about all that's happened.  + Pick up your China Doll    Pick up your China Doll  It's only fractured, Just a little nervous from the fall. â€“Grateful Dead, China Doll   --*I've been watching your world from afar,
