Sakdary correct that. Correcting policy is my job. However, correcting the entire work from some bimbo from last night just throws me off. I have been so feisty to everyone. That is just because co-workers started first. Now you must have thought that I am so selfish huh. Gosh, I hate today.   Being a supervisor is not easy at all. Putting up with people is a Bitch. I was told to let my co-workers know what is going on and how work should be done (correctly). And once I go off doing that, everyone complain to me. WFT? Now, Jim (2nd manager) is going off at me and everyone else because of all these changes. Jim was not around when all the changes took place. Only Kim ( the big manager) was verified. Is it my fault? I don’t think so. I was just doing what I was told to do.    Why can’t everyone just get alone and do their work the way they was told to do. Why trip off every lil things that are coming out of my mouth? Why cant we just work together and corporate without giving each other mean dirty looks? Great, now two co-workers are passing notes around and laughing. Are they laughing at me? Talking about me? Could anyone please tell me what am I doing wrong?   Now I feel like everyone is just trying to bite me in the back when I’m not paying attention. Feels like co-workers are going to stab me with an ax in the back of my head. Now I’m the bad person in their sight. What a very nice way to start out a day man.
