When the waiter asks in his or her midwestern accent what kind of pop you want, don't say "pardon?" or "what did you say?" more than twice if you don't understand.  Just don't.    2.  Remember,  you  have an accent, not them.    3.  Racial jokes are welcome in that conservative, red-neck setting.  After all, you're surrouned by white people 24/7.  It's a great change from California:  fast-food workers actually speak English.    4.  Don't try to leave a note in Spanish for the hotel maids.  They are all African American.    5.  If you've ever had real Mexican food (aka you're from California), do not go to a Mexican restaurant in that area.  The food is laughable.  You're safer going to a Chili's or some other generic restaurant.    6.  Beware!  You're surrounded by people wearing "Vote Bush" buttons.    7.  Bring an umbrella.  At any moment, it could downpour.    8.   Always check the Culver's flavor of the day in your area.  You wouldn't want to miss out on some yummy, home-made frozen custard.    If you keep all of the above in mind, I guarantee you'll survive your trip to the midwest!  :)
