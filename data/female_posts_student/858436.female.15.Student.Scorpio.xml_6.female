English, ha, I'll be happy to get a B. I hate that class. I don't like any of my female teachers. Well, I like Mrs. Choir Seyer. But that's it. Mrs. Welker and Mrs. Ha I cannot stand.  I got my outfit for the dance. :-) It's a sleeveless burgundy/red top with a funky collar thing, and these pants that are kinda khaki, but they're not. And they have these buttons up the two front sides. Very cute. :-) If only I had a date! Haha.  Later kids.
