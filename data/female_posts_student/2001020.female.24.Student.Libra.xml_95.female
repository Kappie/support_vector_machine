Even still, he's still the most beautiful (asshole) I've ever laid eyes on.  From a purely physical standpoint, I have *never* been with someone so beautiful.  Wow.  He is completely amazing to look at, to touch, to kiss, to feel...so it's just fitting that his poison was the hardest to swallow, too.  you caught me lingering  in another girl's paradise  the way she paints the world i want that in my life  emeralds, you should know,  are renting in her meadow  with a stroke beauty lives  *how could i resist you are desire*  *when it all is said, said and done*  *who can love you and still be standing* there's mary calling up a storm  *can i take from you and not keep taking* naked as day gemma follows him  *does it all come down* *to the thing one girl fears in the night* *is another girl's paradise* through twists and turns  jasmine foxed me in her grove  arms filled with honey-bells,  st. michael's sanford bloods  "you have come to discover what you want"  *what i want is not to want what isn't mine* "but i am desire" when it all is said and done.  is another girl  is another girl  is another girl's paradise
