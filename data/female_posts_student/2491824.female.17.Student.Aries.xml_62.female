I feel like poo.. Only colder. ...Like a pile of poo buried in snow...no, not good snow, the icky kind of snow that's along the sides of the road... Ya know, it's all black eewy-looking...  I'd been wanting to post this ever since I first read it, but I kept forgetting... Better late than never!   All guys have to read  Jeeves's  most recent entry (February 15) and take notes.  He could make any girl swoon... She is so lucky... ;)  hehe, and the best part is this:  ". . . I wanted to explain something about the roses to you. The reason that I only got 6 instead of 12. Well... I have six more coming for you... but I'll only give them to you when we're together forever."   Mad props for Jeeves.
