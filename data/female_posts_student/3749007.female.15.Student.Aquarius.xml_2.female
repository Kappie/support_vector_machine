Yeah..ok,..just wanted to get that out..anyways..back to ME!!  Well..so far, today has been pretty boring. No one is on MSN msgr. so I haven't talked to anyone today. Since last Sunday, I've been at my grandparents, so I haven't talked to anybody for almost a whole week..and that's not a good thing, because that means I haven't been able to let my feelings and thoughts out..I haven't had a chance to let out everything that's bothering me. Some things are good, some aren't so good.   And I'm having the worst time trying to make decisions.. The hardest deisions are the ones where you have to decide to listen to your friends, who have good intentions and want the best for you, or listen to your heart and soul, which can make you the happiest person, or give you heartbreak. Now, normally I'd just listen to my mind, but of course, when I need my mind, it decides to take a vacation, which I'm supposed to be doing, but I guess the drama never takes a break, so in the mean time, I'm stuck trying to figure out what's the right thing to do..and it's not all that easy. Some days, I'm convinced that I should just go for it, and then the next, I lose all confidence. So, maybe it's a good thing I've been gone, so that way I don't screw my life up too terribly much.  This Sunday, early in the morning, I'm leaving to go with my church's youth group on a mission trip to Oklahoma. That should be fun, considering I've never been to an Indian Reservation Camp before! We'll see. I'll have to get back with you on that one.  Well, I think I'm gonna give this a rest for a while. Much Love
