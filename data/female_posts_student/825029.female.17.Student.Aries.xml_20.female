Saturday  - Playoff game, then theres this... party for some rich guy that martin wants me to play at with some other ppl.  Maybe ill get a $5 blockbuster gift card!!!  After that, find a reason not to go home.   Sunday  - *sigh* im thinking im going to see harry potter  THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS  (oooooooooooOOOOOOOO scary lightning and music) with my mom and hopefully an unfortunate friend i can sucker into going.  On second thought i might go and like it.  We're doing nothing in computer science right now and im hungry ... for love ;-)  oh!  i just remembered.  one time when i was... 9 i think... some friends and I were playing with someone's dad's golf club (i remember it being a 9 iron, but back then thats the only golf club we knew about so maybe it wasn't) and we were hitting these nuts and rocks we found on the ground cause we ran out of golf balls.  This kid i really didn't like (he was a lot older, like 12, and he always made fun of me and pushed me around) was standing behind me.  So i took a back swing and bashed him in the face.  It was totally an accident but i was almost glad i hit him.  After i hit him i hit the rock over a house -- a beautiful shot -- and then noticed him bent over crying with blood all over his face.  I broke his nose and there was blood everywhere.  It was great. Also, when i was 5 we were in recess and an older kid (6 or 7) made my best friend get off the jungle gym thingy but my friend didn't want to so the older kid punched him and pushed him around.  I got angry and punched the boy in the throat and that was that. A bit violent, but i was just thinking of some precious childhood memories.  Dodododo....  I guess thats it.  Lunch is soon and i hafta do this worksheet. Im crossing my fingers for a great weekend... maybe  yyyyyyyyoooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu  can help me there.  you all have to be happy and have a lot of fun. I, Charles Ayen McTygue III command it be so (more scary lightning).
