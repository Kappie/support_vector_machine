Im now amongst many other people that have the exact same template.  Feh. I don't really care because my blog is different then the others cause it's mine.  Wow, that was corny.   urlLink My other blog  is my work of art. I costom made it myself... its one of a kind.  I can't say that I don't like this layout, I just don't feel that it's "special" because everyone else probly has it too.  Feh.. enough with this.    Turns out that Don* really likes Kelly*.  Apperently, he's really concerned about her life and her safety.  This took me by suprise. I guess my first impression of Don wasn't so great (I saw him when he was drunk).  Lol.  I do hope things all work out fine.  Now my other friend, Karen* is having some other problem of her own.  It is believed that a guy named Calvin* likes her but she's having "mixed" feelings about him.  Heh.. I'm having the same sorta problem but it's not about Calvin or anything. *laughs*.  This sucks. Meep.   *=Names have been changed.  Now for a better subject.  Robin is comming back from the ranch tomorrow.  Yay.. I can't wait t'ill she gets back!! She'll probably have lots to tell.  Unfortunately (but fortunately for Kevan), Kevan is going to a ranch tomorrow.  She'll be gone for 3 days but she'll have fun.  Lol.  Geez.. just when Robin gets back, Kevan leaves! We'll all be reunited again soon. *Smiles*  Well, I'd better get going cause I want to read some more of "noughts  Crosses" (A really interesting book about what the world would be like if "whites" were the slaves of "coloureds").  I'm not really into the book yet but I soon will be... I hope.  lol. I'm going to go now.                        "PeaceTheFuckOut"                 -(Just)Julie  Latest news- The flooring project is really comming along.  The downstairs bathroom is almost fully tiled now.  Tomorrow, we'll finish "tile-ing" the bathroom and then start putting down some nice laminate everywhere downstairs (except in the livingroom and laundryroom). Something to look forwards to- On the 27th of July,or around that date, I might (probably) go to with Robin to a rodio (I think her granpa owns it or something). It should be fun.
