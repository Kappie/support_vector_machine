The social pressures and experiences that I had. The chances I made. The maturing that I did. The friends I had the honor of having in my life. The friends that I have the honor of having in my life. Not to mention finally being truly happy with someone.   I want to go over the major experiences after this academic year. I wish that I did it in years prior. Wait, why the hell not. I have a good enough memory.     6th Grade     -Time to begin discovering who I was. -Brittany was my closest friend  -Starting to become friends with Christine again -Started the year with High Honors and finished with honors the rest of the time -Began struggles with mathematics - Ms. Ball -Loved science, great course with Mr. Connelly -History was not a favorite - Mr. Raggio was still a great guy -English - easy Ms. Ball -I was happy and quiet -Found a knack for languages, such as Spanish with Sr. Alvarez y Sr. Banderas     7th Grade    -Friends with Brittany, Christine, and Kristen -Mr. Rockett twice a day, we was such a fun teacher in science and English -Got to skip English and go to the library because I already knew it -Honors all year -Mrs. Truncellito for history, began liking history -Mrs. Drozd for Pre-algebra...real start of trouble for a lot of people.

I missed them so much. I am also talking to all sorts of new people. One has come up being very negative, but I am not going to hold that against him. I understand. I think...  People no longer see me as "quiet". They see me for who am I, and we have fun together. I love laughing all the time, and I usually do. Nothing has been able to dampen my spirits. Things work out, everything happens for a reason.   Life is finally the way I want it, I am living up to who I want to be, I am doing the things I want to, I am succeeding.   Most importantly, I have all of my friends. I love being able to care for them, and in return they care for me. It does not matter where we all go, we have fun just the same, because it is about the company.   I hope to become closer to some again, Jennie...since I do not disrespect you, I would love to hang out more.   Rils, you are my best friend, and we really do need to hang out  All of us, I want us to go and do what we have always dreamed of.  What is my short-term dream?  Go somewhere special, like the Enders, bring everyone's favorite outdoor lunch, radio, and just be there. Reminisce, make new memories.  I would love for it to be Tycho  if he wanted to bring someone, Ari, Billy, Brian H, Britt, Christine, Frank, Izzy, Jennie  Tim, Jess  Shawn, Kristen, Heather, Marie, Mon Mon, Murky, Rils  Nick if she wished, Roni  Andy, Robbie and his crew, Shawn, Steph, and others. That is the core group lol. Maybe more people from other robotics teams.  That would be a massive party lol.   Actually, I think that is basically all of my friends. I should invite the entire Aces High team, I consider them all my friends...tehehe.   Wow, I have been in such an untouchably good mood. Some things hit here and there...but I get over it. It is so great!  Ea tebea liubliu Tych!!! :-D
