I decided that the reason I like these movies are because I am so fucking stupid/desperate/lonely/i suck. Haha.. no not really.. well probably.. but I guess I don't really think about it THAT much, although it would be nice to have... oh nevermind. I do suck.   haha on a brighter note  "Would you like to put a bullet in your head so I can fuck you real good?"  ~pick-up line for a necropheliac~
