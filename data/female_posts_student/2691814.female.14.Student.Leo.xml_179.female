Yes, i finally could sleep..thankyou LORD!! ....uhh...never thought i would say that. ok anyway, I'm working on a new song on the guitar...i can play it already cuz i know all 'need to know chords' so, its pretty easy. Mom has a temperature. Shes sick, and i feel bad. Especially because she's watching the news. yuck...i dont watch the news anymore unless its super important. I've had enough of this talk about Kuwait and all of those other countries...i just dont wanna hear it lol. Ya so, wat day is it? I think its a tuesday...oh i have dance class dont I. i dont wanna go...i did 30 sit ups and 30 push ups last night, and not those girl push ups i did the real ones  >>Im not sore..so im happy. I have another funny story, but its one of those 'ya had to be there'...well me and deidra were at Osprey Park at a party for a while and when we decided to leave, deidra got out her cell phone and started calling random family members...we were outside at night so, yes I love the night time and I do anything at night but, anyway, All of the sudden someone starts saying something to her and she about throws a fit. Well, I had her camera and while she was making an "OMG!!" face...mouth open and all..i snapped a picture. She stil has and and no one was there to really get the full affect on how funny it was at the time. Plus she's pretty dull...haha j/k...bipolar. Its not really funny funny, but me and deidra still laugh about it. yat yat yat.
