I think he's fine, though. I'm going to be away from the house for a couple of days, depending on my mother. The whole family is going to be staying the weekend at the Bayou House, since it's Father's Day weekend. It makes my dad happy when we all go there, so my mom has decided to make us all go, even though the only one of us that actually likes it there is Austin. I always get sick when I go there. It might have something to do with the air, but I could be wrong. I could just be allergic to being away from the computer. It's going to be really weird because it'll be the first time all summer I haven't been on the computer at night. There's nothing to do there. I'll probably spend my time laying out in the sun or painting one of the rooms. A project I started Thursday, but have failed to finish. I'll miss the lot of you. Miss me, too.
