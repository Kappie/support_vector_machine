Josh, I can't believe you woke up.  That has got to be traumatizing.  You deserve more drugs just for that.  Sharing is nice too ;)  Rosie, I wasn't  going to say I told you so, but then I figured I may never have another chance to say it. In light of all that, I told you so. And also, they shoved a camera inside of Josh to see what's wrong with his stomach.  Scott, Abby was being sarcastic.  It's a little too early to assume Rosie's mom might be turning her into a girl.  And just for Josh's and Abby's reading pleasure, I was reading a book last night, and it used the word "dingleberry" about 10 times.  I laughed so hard I cried.
