I have given it much thought and have decided that over the course of several days, I shall make this change. But knowing how lazy all my friends are, I'm not going to hold my breath on those comments. :)  Oh, and for those of you who are sitting there pondering the Latin above... possibly with a quarter out smirking victoriously over my published mistake and thinking about your first comment (which, undoubtedly would read something like this: "Haven't you even seen a quarter in your life? You misquoted it... it should be  e plurbis unum  you moron. Har har har."), it was a joke. A play on words, if you will. So the joke, my friend, is on you. Har har har.  Yeah... you still don't get it, do you? I took the phrase "From one comes many" and changed it to "From many comes one" showing that all you people thought that you had been the first to email me about "your" idea, when in reality, my inbox had been flooded by people with the  very same  idea. Clever, but you're still scratching you're head, I know. Why do I even bother?  Anyway, this weekend should go by rather quickly. I have rehearsal tomorrow morning (at last!), which should be fun. I was able to get in a lot of practice time this week so, despite my rather cynical start of this entry, I have been in a pretty good mood. I even reorganized my music. Yeah, I'm a nerd.  The big event for the week was a trip to Tri-County Mall. Well, not the trip itself, but the events that unfolded. Matt and I were in the food court minding our own business eating dinner, as normal people do in public places. Out of nowhere, this little kid comes up and helps himself to my food! So I look over towards his mother (who appears to be younger than me) and she's too busy looking at her shoe while her  other  three kids run around the food court to notice. I was sooo mad!!!  The other big even was that I got called for jury duty. On the same day as Liz. What are the odds? Well, as it turns out, I don't have to do it because I don't live in Hamilton County anymore. But those were still some pretty freaky odds, if you ask me.  Well, I'm all talked out for the night. I think I shall work on my composition a bit more and then go to bed. Talk to all you kiddies later!
