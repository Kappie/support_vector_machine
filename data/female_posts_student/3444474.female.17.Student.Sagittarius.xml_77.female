So I suppose I'll see it at some point this week. *sigh* But I did spend some time with Cameron, we just hung out at his house, which was still eventful, lol.  Came home, sorted laundry, listening to  Franz Ferdinand  (woo!)  Meh, could've been worse. I could've spent my night at home, that would've been really boring.   Relaxing now. Said good-night to Cameron. Might read my book.  In The Bedroom  is a very good book, as it turns out. I'm on story two, and it's getting very interesting. I need to see the movie. Yay HBO on Demand. :D  I'm done babbling now. :)
