For now, I'm simply thinking about what is it that CTA could get, and journalists/sociologists often don't get?       The purpose of cognitive task analysis is to model the actions and especially the knowledge and thinking that learners engage in when performing some task. It focuses more on the underlying knowledge, skills, and structures of task performance with a primary goal of acquiring a rich body of knowledge about a domain from experts and assembling that knowledge into a model. Normally consists of a description of the actions that performers engage in associated with the knowledge states necessary to perform those actions; the actions are not only the behaviors but also the decisions that must be made.  (Jonassen, Tessmer and Hannum, 1999, p. 107)        CTA methods for analyzing problem-solving tasks must include  - the essential features of the environment,  - an internal representation of the problem,  - the relationship between the problem-solving behavior and the learner's internal problem representation;  - a description of how problems are solved; and  - what makes problems hard.  (Newell  Simon, 1972)    Jonassen, Tessmer and Hannum (1999) describe three methods of cognitive task analysis:   1. GOMS - Goal, Operator, Methods and Selection  Seeks to analyze and model the knowledge and skills that a user must develop in order to perform tasks on a device or system; describes knowledge of procedures that users perform in a hierarchical arrangement. Result is a description of the Goals, Operator, Methods and Selection rules for any task, breaking down tasks into a meaningful series of goals and sub-goals and continuing until you end up with primitive psychomotor or mental acts.  2. PARI -- Prediction, Action, Result, Interpretation.  Seeks to analyze the system knowledge, procedural knowledge, and strategic knowledge required to solve troubleshooting problems in situated, real-world settings. When presented with a problem, PARI attempts to identify each Action that the problem solver performs, the Precursor to that action, the Result of that action and an expert's Interpretation of the Results of that Action.  3. DNA -- Decompose, Network, and Assess  Seeks to provide an easy procedure for eliciting knowledge and skill elements from experts and represent the diverse kinds of knowledge required to reason and function in any domain; works by identifying a hierarchically structured knowledge base of curriculum elements for instructional and training purposes. Ultimate goal is to produce the expert model for intelligent instructional systems.
