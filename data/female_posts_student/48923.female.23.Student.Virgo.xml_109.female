(everyone is in a circle. and they put their left arm ontop of the person next to them's right arm.  then you go around the circle, with one clap [on the table] equals a continue in the same direction and two claps equals a directional switch.  if you mess up, the offending hand is taken away.  this also works as a drinking game.)    while waiting for the nurse, a overly excited boy told me his life story all the way down to finding out he had nits.  while waiting for the nurse, the girl calmed down and nearly chewed the ear off the bunny toy i took from the classroom to comfort her.   i managed to rediscover my multiple voices (as a kid, i'd giggle about the different voices i could make) to create a story with the bunny and a magnifying glass.  while waiting, J, turned sweet and slightly disturbing.     it started off with her seeing the ice, as the nurse was zipping all over the place.  (the ice came out of a silicon ice tray, and had silly shapes.)  she wanted some ice for her injuries.  doe eyed and tilting her head, she starts begging for ice. batting her eyes "i'll do anything for ice.. anything" she coos in such a way i wish the office wasn't full of lice-ridden-kids and had a councilor could talk to her about......  what might've caused the in class outburst.  the sad thing was, after waiting inside of the nurses' office for a good 45 minutes, the girl was dismissed and would possibly be looked at later....
