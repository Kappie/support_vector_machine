Have you ever got mad at someone for the stupidest reasons? lately I have and its only because I am scared that I am going to loose him to someone else or just loose him in a couple of months because it isn't going to work out, and the reason it doesn't work out is because of distance and never being able to see each other. That is why I have been so mad lately its just because I am scared of loosing him forever. I love him and I don't wanna loose him I wanna spend the rest of my life with him. I am just scared that him going to a different school next year is going to break us up, or him finding someone else. I wanna tell him how I feel but I don't know how. Someone help me to not be so worried. I love him and I don't want him to leave me because I don't know what I would ever do with out him. He is the only good thing that I have in my life. Well I have my friends but that's different.   I love Kenny more then anything on this earth and I don't wanna loose him.
