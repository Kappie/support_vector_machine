We played monopoly, clue, soccer, basketball, then I had to pull them around in a wagon for like half-an-hour which actually was really fun, and we watched Monsters Inc.  Kids are so fun!  I can't wait til' I have kids, but yeah I am just slightly young right now.  I made $40 for the night, so that will pay for Tuesday.  Some of my friends and me are going to laser quest, barbecuing in fish creek, going to Chinook to bowl, having dinner out, and then going to a movie.  We always have like a day of fun once school is over every year, so this is what we decided we are going to do this year.  This morning I went out for Brunch at the Carriage House Inn.  Ashley was working, so I saw her and apologized for missing her party, but I am seeing her Tuesday.  I will also give the gift I bought her on Tuesday to her.  Anyways, we went to brunch with Melissa, Ben, Collen, Martin, my Mother, my Dad (he's in town for once in a blue moon) and of course myself.  You know what the retard did at the gas station yesterday...He left EVERYTHING open - the fuel door thing and like the twisty thing that you have to unscrew to fill up the car with gas.  Luckily I went to go wash my car right after that.  While I was washing it, I got around the that side and noticed it open, right after I had filled up.  Errrr, that makes me so mad.  If it was raining my car would have been ruined if water had gotten in.  I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know how to fill up a car with gas and it is only common sense that if you have to twist a knob to put the gas in, it's likely you also have to CLOSE it as well.  Next time I am just going to go to self serve, even though last time I swear the guys in the gas stating were laughing their ass off because I couldn't twist the cap thing off.  So then I had to ask some lady, because that was the first time I had ever filled up with gas.  I can't wait for Summer school to start, but on the other hand at least now I have some time to go to the gym and work out.  I haven't been for a long time, and I have been eating a lot more than usually because I am trying to get out of my habit of weighing myself all the time.  It's almost like an obsession I have.  I must weight myself at least four times a day, if not more.  Twice in the morning and twice at night.  It's hard trying not to gain weight though.  There is so much pressure to be thin and look good and everything.  It will be nice to get Social 30 out of the way too.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to use the strategies I used this year to get myself through Social.  I ended with an 82% and that is pretty good for not knowing a thing.  I mean all I did for all the long answer tests were write out the answers to the questions they gave us and memorize then word for word.  It doesn't matter in the world today whether you understand or not.  Everyone just looks at marks and uses that as an estimate, which in my opinion is stupid.  I mean you can't measure what one knows based on marks.  There is to much emphasis put on achieving, and everyone always praises those who are so smart.  Then again I guess I get praised for hard work.  It's like being complimented for TRYING to be smart - sometimes I wonder if that should be taken as a compliment of not.  That's a tough one.  It's hard to believe next year will be grade twelve.  I will be at the TOP of the food chain.  That feels good, but it doesn't mean everything.  There is so much pressure to succeed, and I already put numerous amounts of pressure on myself to do good.  I want to get into University so badly.  That is the one goal I am ultimately working towards.  I know that if I get in, I can do that stuff with hard work and well probably going to have to hire a tutor.  I might even need a tutor for next year because no one seems to take me seriously when I saw I don't understand my math.  I mean no one really knows just how frustrating it is, going home and just crying for like hours because you really want to understand and you just keep trying and trying, but can't seem to get the right answer.  That is why I doubt myself a lot.  I mean really, people expect me to believe in myself, but after trying and failing so many times you would think there would be a time and a place to draw the line of: I can and I can't.  If that makes any sense at all.  I probably will need a tutor for Chem 30 next year too, but I really want to try doing it without a whole bunch of tutors.  I want to be able to do the stuff myself you know.  I don't want to be dependent or reliable on other people all the time to 'teach me this, and show me that.'    I hope I get all the hard courses in the first semester for grade twelve year.  I want at least just the Math and Chem.  That way second semester I won't be so stressed and will go through my depressive state at the beginning of the year, rather than the end.  I want to enjoy high school, it's just not always that easy though.  I'm so scared of Diploma's next year too.  I mean C'mon, why on Earth would they make them worth 50%.  Some people like me, try and they try, but doesn't necessarily dictate how good of a mark I will get.  My tests are my weakness for most subjects.  Like half of the subjects I do good in, is for the reason that I work my ass off for my future goals and dreams that I am NEVER going to give up on, and most of my marks are as high as they are because I do ALL of the homework.  I don't think anything is going to change though, it's just I don't chose to fail half of the tests I do, I mean I REALLY honestly try my best to pass.  I mean what will happen if I fail a Diploma.  Maybe I shouldn't be so negative, but I mean you always have to consider all the possibilities.  The University are especially going to pay close attention to my marks in the Science courses I have taken.  The thought of having to do Chemistry courses and Math courses in University scare me a lot.  I am the girl who still doesn't even understand how to balance an equation properly and needs to eventually pass University Chem.  I have proven to myself that I can do just about anything I put my mind to.  So when I make it in into University (Which I will because I didn't work my ass off for nothing)then I will probably have to face one of the biggest challenges of my life.  Mat and I argued this morning, about Tuesday that we are all getting together and stuff.  We argued about a stupid movie.  He was like "Oh, we all agreed to see Chronicles of...??Can't actually remember anymore" yeah I forgot what the last word was, but it's like some action shit I don't want to see.  Then I told him that like why would I pay for a movie I don't even want to see.  And he was like "Well you can't always have your way."  Well you know what, if I don't want to see that fucking movie, then hell I am not going to go see it.  He pisses me off so much something.  I can't even believe I am dating him.  So sorry Mat if you somehow happen to find my journal and read this, but I really have to get off all the shit I am feeling so I don't end up almost killing myself like the thousand other times I came so close.  He is way too into my looks.  I mean no one was attracted to me until I came back after last summer 50 pounds lighter.  There is this one comment specifically I remember, he said: "I can't wait until I get back from the flight camp because you will have lost more weight."  I mean buddy your being TOTALLY unrealistic.  Just because I lost 50 pounds one summer, doesn't mean I am going to come back to school again even thinner.  I look just fine (well I admit I would like to loose more, but right now I am not trying cause I have other issues I need to deal with) and like it's all about my stupid looks.  Looks are nothing, personality is everything.  The more I get to know him, the more turned off I am.  I miss Aaron, I loved Aaron.  I really hope he comes back for the Summer so I can see him.  He is like my perfect match.  I didn't believe in love at first sight until I met him.  Now that was love at first site, then our personalities just complimented each other like leaves in the wind.  I swear Aaron is the one.  Ok, not kidding, not joking, not being unrealistic.  I mean they say there is always someone out there that is meant for you.  With Aaron I feel so loved and accepted, so free to be who I really am.  To him, he loved me the way I was.  He didn't think I was too big, or too thin, just right.  We had so much fun together.  I had public affection with just about anyone, but with him it was so different.  I felt good showing public affection with him.  I just wish he didn't live so far away.  I mean I can't exactly fly to Halifax and I swear last summer it was fate that brought the two of us together.  In fact, the minute he stepped of the west side bus at C.O.P. for an off-trip, my attention drew directly toward him.  He made me feel confident and just wild.  When we all took turns going on the bungee trampoline he was like "Vanessa, do a flip, you can do it."  I was so scared, but I did it for him and it was so much fun.  Then he dumped a bucket of water on me and we had a huge water fight, just the two of us without even knowing each other that much back them.    Nothing in life seems to ever make sense does it.  I mean I seem to have failed myself in so many different areas.  I mean I failed in relationships, I literally failed Drivers Ed, but with so much damn hard work and practice I finally got my license (Some miracle of God, seriously that was so stressful), and well sometimes I feel I failed myself in school.  All the times I really try.  Sometimes I think people underestimate how much effort and work I put in, trying to get a good mark.  That is why it's so upsetting to fail.  I guess that is the whole lesson in life though.  We try and we fail, and we try and we fail.  I suppose with failure we understand more about life and the rest of the world.  Maybe the world is trying to send me one big message or trying to teach me some important lesson.  Maybe I am just crazy.  That seems like a good option.  There is so much that is on my mind right now though, I am pretty stressed.  You would think that with the end of school, life wouldn't be as hectic, but thinking of the future and what awaits me is a pretty scary thing.
