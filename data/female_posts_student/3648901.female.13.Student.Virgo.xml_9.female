Also tonight(Im at my Grammz) the cops shot another bear out here. It kicked ass. And I ordered The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, Marilyn Mansons autobio. Supposed to get it in about 4 days. I also bought The Wordsworth Golden Treasury of Verse. Poems that are a few centuries old, including The Lady of Shallot. Well thats bout it. Go check out Ashleys blog.  www.ashleylandry.blogspot.com
