One minute I'll feel so strongly about something and then the next I don't. It's strange, I know. Well, I had a long talk with Carol today in study hall about the *boys*. And it helped a lot for her to just listen to it. Today was my first day of sitting first for wind ensemble. I love it. I had a test in English today that I think I did really good in. And my bus ride home was extremely uneventful. Carol is still trying to convince me that this guy is perfect for me. She seems happier about it than I am.  Tomorrow I'm leaving school 15 minutes early to go to Kim's softball game in Hannibal. I won't be back until late. Then Friday I'm going to majors fest and will be back around 6 (?).  We got this new music magazine for free in the mail today. It's called Spin or something like that. It has some cool stuff in it. I cut a lot of stuff out and put it on my door to my room. My favorite is an ad for a bunch of my favorite bands on a cd called Rock Against Bush Vol. 1.   So, right now I'm just listening to random music that I have on my computer and downloading Rise Against.   Listening to: [I Want To Hear You Sad by The Early November]  These eyes are strongly covered in disguise We're waiting on the real Time again you'll see That no one knows for sure  CHORUS:   For all of this I'm better off without you Do you regret all your loneliness?    This ride is drifting slowly to the side We're swerving off the road Going past the cones That warned us from the start  CHORUS [x2]  Every day goes, every night goes [repeat]  On and on we sing a song A tired day that's oh so long Every night I sing this song for you  CHORUS [x2]
