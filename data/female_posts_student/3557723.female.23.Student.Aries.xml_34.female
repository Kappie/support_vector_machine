It started off good, then went bad then finished good. So I figure okay.  I went to the airport for my first shift. That went good. Everything went well. I was thinking, "What a TERRIFIC Monday!" However, I discovered I packed the wrong shirt for my short stint at the pharmacy so I had to head home before going there.  And luckily I did too. I found my fiancee at home. I instantly get worried as he never stays home unless he's sick. He isn't one to complain so when he's sick, he's sick. Me on the other hand, sorta the opposite. I'm the pathetic one. Anyhow it turned out that he did call my workplace and he only had the number to one out of the two offices. The receptionist refused to give him the number of the second office despite my fiancee introducing himself and saying that it was important. The call was made at 9:30AM. The plane had left and we were doing a general tidy up.  I got home at 10:15AM. Still no call from the receptionist. I get the details of what happenned from my fiancee after finding out what was wrong with him. He could barely walk!! >_  I also said to my supervisor that I expected an apology from the receptionist. I understood that if I didn't get one, I didn't get one but was very tempted to go to the receptionist to give her a large chunk of my mind plus more. But I wasn't going to because I didn't want to lower myself to her level. My supervisor did however pass this all onto the boss. The boss pulled the receptionist aside at 11:30AM/12:00PM stating that she needed to apologise to me and whether she had even passed the message on. The receptionist hadn't and the boss pointed out that I still wouldn't know had I not gone home and asked for a reason. The receptionist didn't have any reason apart from "I don't know."  During my second shift at the airport, the receptionist makes no effort to apologise to me face to face. She makes a phone call home sounding significantly different to my fiancee who answered it to the point that he didn't recognise her. She then makes a phone call to the second office from which I was based wanting to speak to me FIVE minutes before the plane was due to land. I happenned to be the one to marshall it in, (You know, wave the batons at the plane with those secret signals.), so I HAD to be out there.  The receptionist made a deadly mistake when apologising. And that is ladies and gentlemen is to lie and make excuses. When you apologise, you are admitting wrong a claiming full responsibility and if you can fix the situation, you do so. That is how I have been brought up. And chances are, the person you're apologising to already has figured out what went wrong and where, just like I had today.  She first blamed my fiancee for not stressing the importance of his call to which I state that I had already spoken to my fiancee and that I know that he had stated the importance and that he even requested the number of the second office.   This of course led to the reason that she isn't allowed to give out the number as it is a private number. I point out the fact that the number is allowed to be given out to family and that I only have one fiancee. (And by the way, she does know who my fiancee is and also, it isn't a secret.) She then states that she doesn't know who to give the number out to. I point out that I have been working for the company for a shorter period of time than her and know exactly who to give the number to and who not to The she says that she's been in trouble for giving the number out in the past. (Now she's blaming the boss.) I point out the blatantly obvious again and point out that it was only by pure chance I went home and that my fiancee was barely walking when I got there. I also added that she had no idea how furious I was when I found out and how inconvenienced I was during what was supposed to be a calm 2 hour break as I had to rush and get medication for my fiancee. She said she was sorry and that she was trying her best. To this I simply state, "Thanks anyway." and hung up. And everyone that was around me at the time heard me and was shocked especially the leading hand who heard everything that I said. But I was angry and had no time for arguements.  I think a few people thought that I was still angry but I told them that I was fine and that I was only angry at the receptionist, not them and that I direct my anger at the source, not everything else around me. Which was true since I hadn't said a word of it to anyone until then.  I did mention to my supervisor that I had been rude to the receptionist and explained what had occurred but it was no big deal as she saw it and understood. My supervisor has also had problems with the receptionist so I thought it would also be a good idea to talk to the boss as well to which I did and it was all okay. I did state what I said verbatim and what the receptionist had said.  I hate to think what would have happenned had I not have got home and found out while I was at the airport.  My fiancee will be alright. He should be back at work tomorrow. I basically told him to rest and left no room for arguement. And that is why my day is finishing on a high note.
