My hair is frizzy and in the way..I always wonder if i'll be alright when I get older..I think about the people that I will lose and it makes me think even harder about what I would do. I want to play the flute..I know it must be hard. Maybe next year i'll join the highschool's band. I like the way it sounds..so peaceful and relaxing..Sort of sad, but happy too. I guess it depends on what your playing. I think about my art too. If I will keep doing it and be great at it..or just stop and forget. Im depressed sometimes because I start thinking about the future..Im scared and worried that things wont work out or something. *sighs* Im worried about my one true love walking out of my life and never seeing him again. I may be young, but when he is with me..it feels right. I feel at peace with myself and I think better of myself. I laugh and smile, like I did when I was just a small child. I lost my childhood at the age of 8. I can never have that feeling back, but I can feel better knowing that I can act as a child around him. Teenagers go through so many problems in those years of misunderstanding, not doing what other's tell you to do, not careing about some people that are close to you. You push them away and it hurts inside when you realize what you've done. Hurt and pain are some problems today..When we get upset, we think of oneself, we think that all of the bad things happen on only us. That isn't true..But anger is a very different feeling from others, yet they are related and share some sides. I know this is confusing, but not to me. I have learned from my mistakes and learned some wrong from right, but..Im still a child. I am still the small weakling that is in the far corner, hiding from the monster in the closet. Someone saved me from my fears, he is fighting for me and I hope I won't suffer anymore with the past that I had. I fucked up a lot in the past and maybe...maybe I can overcome all of that and be my self again. One day, we can all live in a world of peace..So we don't have to hide anymore..
