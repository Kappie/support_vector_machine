RYLA has been fuckin incredible.  i've changed a lot, not just in outwards manner, but the way that i look at myself.  the kids and counselors are family, we're all hella close, all 180 of us.  last night we had eulogies for 2 campers and everyone was crying and holding each other.  i've had deeper talks with these strangers than i've had with some of my closest friends.  i've gotten heartfelt compliments that left me bawling and really understanding myself, and i've said stuff that made grown men bawl too and a crowd whimper.  this camp is the fuckin shit, i feel really at peace here, so yeah.  RYLA!!!  anyway, heh last night has been on my mind a lot because it was a culmination of a lot of maturing here.  i also spent yesterday learning how to act.  i had no fuckin clue how to perform The Open Boat before, but now, its fuckin good, even i can tell.  i can't wait to deliver it this morning.  i feel like an orator delivering the work on the chapel stage. hehe.  this will be my second or third speech here- each has been seriously something i'm proud of.  i'm not nervous in front of groups up here and can improv damn well.  i miss ya guys, especially you jessie.  there have been so many times i've wanted to have you here.  u'd be in heaven too at RYLA.  everyone, and i mean EVERYONE is so frank, friendly, and outgoing.  everyone has a talent nad isn't afraid to express it.  we had some guitarists playing the Brown Girl or whatever the song is that you play.  they did a duet and it was hella good. i'm missing YOUR campfires and ur fucking laptop (typing on one just like yours right now).  people really want to see me cross dressing (apparently the swimmer look goes REALLY FAR at camp).  even this foreign exchange english lifeguard wants to (mmm, she HOT).  so yea jessie, i've got a lot of stories to tell you and a lot of discussin to do.  i trust things are going well with you... how is the bulgaria oh um belgium (sorry forgot the name) situation?  don't post, i won't be able to read this thing for a while, tell me.  i'll see you guys later, maybe sometime in august, i'm not sure yet.  one of my good friends here, gerrardo, wants me to come with him to his place in el salvador (a nice place, not a hut).  and i may ship off to africa too, to help out rotary.  whatever works out.  LATER
