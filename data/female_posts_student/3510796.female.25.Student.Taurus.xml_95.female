I figured I should type out some random bullshit to make it seem like I just dont use this blog for set list and words that people probably dont even read. =')  So here I am, waking up on a Saturday morning, before noon.  Waking up to kids who smell like syrup.  Not my favorite smell, but I can handle it.  The kids and I, along with my mom and dad and my brothers family, all went up to St. Joe, MI for the Venetian Festival.  It Started to rain on the way up, so we ended up eating at this restaurant.  Stooges-no one go there if you're ever in St. Joe.  Food was real good, but the owner was a bitch who didn't get her medication.  There was nine of us, five adults and four kids.  There was a table for six and about four booths that sat four, open when we arrived.  We were told that they had no idea how long we would wait.  I asked if some of us could sit at the table and the others sit at a booth.  I was told that isn't policy.  So the next time the hostess came back, I told her that we didn't know my brother and his family and that we wanted to sit down at the table.  The owner was going all crazy telling me that they couldn't spilt up groups.  I told her that's OK, I didn't even know that group.  After a good five minutes of a 'disagreement', we all had a place to sit and hoped we wouldn't get someone's bodily fluid in our dinner.  Im not sick yet.    After dinner, we all walked down to the bluff near Lake Michigan to find a place to sit for the fireworks.  There was a band playing and my brother and I looked at each other and both thought the same thing. Then I hear Sophia say, 'Dave Matthews!'  No folks, it wasn't Dave Matthews, but it was a band who sounded like them.  Walked over to check them out.  Kids got out and danced like the little hippies that they are.  This band was pretty good.  They ended with an almost exact dmb version of 'Watchtower'.  I tell ya, people know when Im coming around.    Continued on to find a spot to lay our blankets and to find one of those god awful Joy Johns.  I don't know what the Joy is all about, I hate those things.  Took Mo in one and he ended up gagging and spitting.  Saying things like, 'It smells in here.  I'm going to throw up.'  OK Mo, we all feel like that.  I've even lost a phone in one!!!  Another story, another time.  Ask me if you know me, or if you even care. Wrapping up this saga, the fireworks were awesome, a good half hour.    Onto a baby shower this afternoon.  Oh, I know you cant wait to hear about that one.  =)  Sports Report Won one, lost one in the Milwaukee series.  This is where it really matters too, we need to win and not get behind that 8 games out second place slot to this Brewer team.  Playing St. Louis this weekend.  beer...sounds...good.  But! , I cant....give....in.  Even with teeth clinching.  By the way, if you got my email about the wisdom teeth, I don't have mine because I never had the roots for them, Im not a toothless chic.  Ya dig!?!  Nancies Report Well, I think ya got it down below in my set list.  Have fun!  Local Report Now, I dont have the link to the story yet, but my mom was telling me that a lady who is mentally retarded got on the bypass going the wrong way one day last week.  She hit a car with a dad, mom and three kids.  The dad died and the three year old child had serious spinal cord injuries.  He was flown to Rileys Children's Hospital in Indianapolis.  Supposedly the prosecutor is trying to figure out how and why this lady had a drivers license.  A spokesman from the BMV said that anyone can get a drivers license, even if they do not KNOW HOW TO READ.  They can take an oral test and then pass the drivers test....without knowing HOW TO READ!  This boggles my mind, more so than the crack head owner of the restaurant.  So if you're driving down the road and you see someone going the wrong way, you might be able to thank the BMV for letting someone out who cant read a sign that says WRONG WAY or DO NOT ENTER.    ya'll have a nice day now.  peace.LOVE.dmb.
