Pierce asked me if I wanted to join the SM kids blog andIi agreed..It'ss kinda neato tho!! I like it!   Our housedefinitelyy sold and we are moving into our new house on July 16...earlier than we were thinking but that's better so we can all go to the beach the week after and relax...well mostly my mom so she doesn't have to worry about any of the moving stuff!!! I'm kinda excited about moving...but still kind of not!! Oh well it'll be fun!   I am so0o0o bored...I hate being sick cuz there is nothing fun to do...oh wellI'lll just go and watch Full House (Full House is my Life!!)
