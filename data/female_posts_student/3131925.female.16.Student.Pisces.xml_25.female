I felt so proud of myself, the way you said I would, that I didn't drink and drive, though some friends thought I should. I made a healthy choice, and your advice to me was right as the party finally ended, and the kids drove out of sight. I got into my car, sure to get home in one piece, I never knew what was coming, mom something I expected least. Now I'm laying on the pavement, and I hear the policeman say, "the kid that caused this wreck was drunk," mom, his voice seems so far away. My own blood's all around me, as I try hard not to cry. I can hear the paramedic say,"this girl is gooing to die." I'm sure the guy had no idea, while he was flying high, because he chose to drink and drive, now I would have to die. So why do people do it, mom knowing that it ruins lives? And now the pain is cutting me, like a hundred stabbing knives. Tell sister not to be afraid, mom tell daddy to be brave, and when I go to heaven, put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave. Someone should have taught him, that it's wrong to drink and drive. Maybe if his parents had, I'd still be alive. My breath is getting shorter, Mom I'm getting really scared. There are my final moment, and I'm so unprepared. I wish that you could hold me mom, as I lie here and die. I wish that I could day I love you, mom so I love you and goodbye..
