Just recently, I had a "thing" with a friend I've had nearly all my life which actually turned out to be quite unexpected, nice, scandalous (say what you will, I'm comfortable with myself.)  and also very dumb.  But as we said then, "Because we're dumb!".  Anyway, after an ordeal with past boyfriends/ girlfriends, we finally made it possible to actually pursue a relationship.  Now, I'm not saying that I was entirely ready for this, so I know I'm partly to blame for what ensued; after being in a relationship for over two years, I was hesitant to return to the whole responsibility of having a "boyfriend".  Maybe I just didn't like him as much as I thought I did.   By the way, I'm trying to be as nonspecific as possible- I hate the type of people that bitch and name names on something as cowardly as a blog, you know what I mean- but I hope it's not impossible to understand... oh well, I guess my friends will understand, and that's all that really matters.  But returning to the aforementioned issue, the friend now has a girlfriend.   After a few days after a date-type thing.  What the hell.  I guess what gets me is that he never told me, and he really led me to believe that "we" could work out, and the "Oh, I like you sooo much" crap.   Maybe I'm being too cynical; I should be glad, right?  I mean, I wasn't ready for a boyfriend, and now I don't have to worry about it.  Great, eh?  ...nope.  I just feel dumb, but I suppose it's a fitting ending for something that began with the words "Because we're dumb!".
