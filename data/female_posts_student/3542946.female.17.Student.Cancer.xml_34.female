When I first created the ministry of pornography, I, like Max, Peter, and Anwar, chose positions that best suited their talents. I am an expert in the traditional Ralph style pornography, along with more internet age Paris Hilton sex tapes dubbed in Korean. However, certain people have misinterpreted this and view my posts as a sort of written pornography, exciting those who oppose my views. They, shall we say, intellectually masturbated to my posts, creating a fierce debate. Now, to take a bad metaphor too far, we have reached orgasm. Will the office of pornography fall? You decide.
