I'm getting my hair CUT!  After spring break though.  I am going to donate it! wahhoo!!!  I was gonnna do it tomorrow but we have a game at MARK MORRIS which is like an hour away, longer by bus so we are going to be gone till 8:30. Which really stinks because I can't go to church!! Which is mundo depressing. Church rocks.   SPEAKING OF CHURCH AND GOD RELATED ACTIVITIES...   Oh! random, my grandpa is giving me spending money for Cali! Gosh, my grandpa rocks!  BACK ON TOPIC!  I might get to go to creation afterall!!!  SEE!  I am going to pay Jacob to take me. And, I am going to pay for everything (food, gas, tickets, camping) PLUS pay him 20 dollars a day for taking care of me ;) Which will make a MAJOR dent (-$400) in my savings account but it will ALLLLLL be worth it!  Creation is the best thing on EARTh.  I just have on dilema...superchick and falling up are playing at the same time on different stages! Oh dear. I might not go to superchick then hang with them afterwards or vise versa. I LOVE CREATION! S-foots gonna be there tooo!!  But they got booted up to the night set which means they wont sign autographs. Waa.. *To much for me to handle*  BUT!  Creation is still the best thing EVER.  Speaking of best things.  MANDY!  I GOT YOUR LETTER!  That sticker is creeptastic...i think i'm gonna put it on my binder to ward of the evil forces of ZANE!  :)   Speaking of EVIL FORCES   Miss Saul was in a BAD mood when she made the science seating chart. Geez. The closest friend by me is Katie and she is farrr away and obviously daniel preoccupies her time ;-) I am by Eric. Which really isn't that bad considering Zane is FARRRRRRR AWAY!!!! Wahho! No creepy stares, baby!  But still, this whole situation scares me. A lot.  See, Zane is hurting so much and I desperatley want to help him but if I start being realy nice to him he might think I like him or somethign and when I tell him I don't like him or if he starts to follow me everywhere he might like r ape me or like murder me or something.  Which he is fully capable of doing.  That my friends is what SCARES me.  Every day it always enters my ming, and I serisouly don't feel safe at all at school.  And it seems as if my friedns don't take this serious, but it IS serious.  Gosh, this is compromising my values.  I want to be a loving christian but its SO hard for me to show love to this guy who stalks me everywhere.  But that I hate the MOST is the STARES it feels like he can r ape me without even thouching me.  Okay, enough about this.  Yuck.  Why did i get on THIS topic! UGH!  Its runing my life. :)
