One of them is "What Held Jesus to the Cross?" and under it says "Love can be so strong that nothing else matters"  Love huh, now I was under the impression it was nails. Question: Wouldn't love then release him from the cross, not you know, keep him there?  Gatta love those badly worded church flyers that people shove in my door. Well no, not really, but it was funny.
