That's why I don't tell any body anything cause people just suck and GOD I hate them so much... It's like.. people need to just leave me alone... I hate it I really do... I can't wait to get out of here... not even to just like get out of Staten Island but to just like leave all these gay people who think they know what's goin on and really they have no idea... and it's not like your everyday ordinary "omg did you hear what she did last weekend" kind of thing its things that only I would be able to tell people and they twist what I say around and just be all gay... GOD...
