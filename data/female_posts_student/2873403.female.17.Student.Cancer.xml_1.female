My mom is an idiot, my dad is leaving (supposedly only for a week or something, but who really knows for sure?) Extreme makeover doesnt make people look better. It makes them look different. Completely different, but still just as ugly as before. James started calling again...strange... I have mucho confusion these days. I dont know what im doing, what I want. Ok Steve is a stupid asshole piece of shit bitch. and so is my mom. i hate my "family." And when i say this, people say, "no, you're just pissed off and its probably your fault anyway, yaddy fuckin yaddah, you have to love them." Well fuck that. Thats not how my life works. And at this very moment I am getting yelled at...for what? absofuckinglutely nothing. Its always nothing and i hate everything. sigh. hold please, im in need of a tissue....ah screw it. not getting up. sleeves dry up tears just as well. I need to get away.... i remember back when i used to never go home after school... i'd always go to chris's house or mike's house or something and just waste time because I hated to be here. Then I started getting caught. Allllll thanks to my wonderful loving sisters. I cant get away. Even if I could, I'd have nowhere to go. Cant really go to Chris's too much anymore... in fact I havent been there in a looooooooong time. I have no where to go anymore. No escape. Nothing. And now my mom is fucking up the whole lacrosse thing for me too. The only thing that matters to me. The only thing I have, and shes trying to take that away too. I dont know what to do anymore.
