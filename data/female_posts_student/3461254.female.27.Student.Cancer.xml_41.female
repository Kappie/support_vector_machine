On Channel 7 this morning, I was informed that it could reach 91 degrees today.  Keeping all this in mind, I shlepped myself outside to read and returned about fifteen minutes later because I was chilly.  Not that this office is balmy either: I have goosebumps and a runny nose.  If I'm getting sick, there will be serious hell to pay.  I'm blaming John for this one; it's probably a reptile virus.  Damn.  I've got to recover by Sunday!  I'm going to the  urlLink Detroit Zoo  with Mike!  Yippee.  Now, what to wear...  I have a nice khaki skirt, maybe a white shirt, but I'll probably look like someone dressing for safari, and I'm not going to be that dork this time!
