And she was saying how she used to be so into pop and stuff but know she's into punk. I told her that she still listened to pop. It was mean, I know, but I couldn't help it. I knew I would say something one day or other. And being worried and upset with Amanda made me go over.  I feel bad about it, and don't want to confront what she says about it but I know I'll have to because it's lame to run away from things like that.
