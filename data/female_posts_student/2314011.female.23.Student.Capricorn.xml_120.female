All else is fabulous, and the links are still pretty damn cool, really.  And the original bloggy is still lurking around the archives (gasp!).   Had an action-packed night completely devoid of homework.  Well, except for the two pages of Civil Procedure.  Cashed in a dinner Joey owed me and we spent a nice chunk of the evening on the living room floor with our roasted chicken, macaroni salad and dinner rolls from Safeway watching The Spy Who Shagged Me.    Good times.
