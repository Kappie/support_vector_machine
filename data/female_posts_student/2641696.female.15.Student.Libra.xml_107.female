Anyway, my dog's sick *cries* And you all know how much I love my dog. Ivy's been at the vet since yesterday morning, she's been sick since Tuesday night and still nobody knows what's wrong with her. They're taking more tests to find out what the problem is. But here's the thing -- she's never really been gone from home for this long, and I can't help but think how  lonely  it is! I really really miss my ikkle baby, and I just hope nothing's really wrong. Apparently it's bowel problems (so far), but the vet can't see anything obstructing 'clear passage..' So yes, I am very sad and slightly devastated and in a bad bad mood.
