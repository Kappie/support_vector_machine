No, no just kidding, but I am pretty sad he left, he played for Man Utd for 13 years.     But I have to say I am very  ANGRY  with United right now. They have lost there 2 games in the USA Tour!! 0-0 against Bayern Munich (lost by penalty shots) and a 2-1 loss agianst Celtic....WHO LOSES TO CELTIC!?!?! But I can tell you why we're losing all our games... FERGIE IS AN A-HOLE!!! He left all the star players at home to "rest" because they just got done with Euro 2004. BLAH BLAH BLAH! They are football (soccer for you americans) players, it's there job! But he has wised up...a little bit, for there last game here in NYC he is bringing Scholes and Silvestre in. With O'Shea and Keane already here we stand a much better chance. But I do think it would be wise to bring in Saha and Nistlerooy...Grr...    Well, thanks for listening in my time of venting, lol, this is nothing though, you should see me DURING the game, I'm known to throw a shoe or a couch or something....
