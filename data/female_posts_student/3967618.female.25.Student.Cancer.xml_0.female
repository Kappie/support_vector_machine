What can I say? As an stifled artist, I am hoping that the noise, trash and abundance of fellow students will push me into a new creative space. HA!  Ignore the fact that my description makes it apparent that this 'awakening' will be much different than I expect--i.e. 2:30 a.m. travels across the street to tell neighbors to turn it down, and yet 2 hours later I'll be on my third beer.  O the romantic notions of the alienated writer!   Not to mention that I am a senior and this is my final hurrah until I become a 'real adult.'  It really bugs me when people say that, as if upon graduation I will simply begin my march toward death--listening to and lusting after Rod Stewart and wearing holiday themed sweatshirts year round.  I formally pledge that I will retain my wild eccentric side as I age-No better, I'll fall further into a wackyness that is oblivious to what others think (so that I have full licence to wear holiday themed sweatshirts year round).  No really, to hell with our youth-worshiping society, I can't wait to be a wise crone who doesn't give a shit.
