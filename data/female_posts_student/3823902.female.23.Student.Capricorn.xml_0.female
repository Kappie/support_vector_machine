I feel that everyday I grow a little and learn more about myself... but can I call that an accomplishment? After talking to my best friend today I drowned in thoughts... Thoughts of my life, of my present and my future... I'm a very anxious person and thinking about the future always makes me even more so... She made me stop and think... what do I want? I don't know... I don't know, really... That scares me... I wonder if I'm mediocre to have such vain concerns. I feel that there is much more that I need to do and somehow I don’t get around it… What is my problem????????????? The problem is that only I can find the answer…
