(which by the way is a bitch!)  Anyway im going from last weekend, which was an exeat so we had the weekend off! Basicaly the weekend is where i catch up on lost sleep but i woke up at 7am both days! thats before i wake up in the week! Anyway the daytime wasnt much better as i had my family  bitching and constantly moaning at me! it was boring and horrid so i went onto the computer for the whole day! I learnt some more HTML and went onto my old email account and found that i had an email from neopets about my account which had been unfrozen! I was sooooooooooo happy so i played all day and had no dinner! My mum was in such a bad mood so i kicked her too! in all a bad day! - knowing how saturday went on sunday i went straight to the computer and spent more time on there! Then i came off the computer at 7pm and did my homework and some revision! it was boring but i had to do it until 9pm when i went and had a shower. I then got told off for avoiding jobs by having a shower and i said that i needed to have a wash! this started another argument so i took my dinner and ate it in my bedroom watching tv until 11.30pm. So when i woke up today i was absolutly shattered, this wasnt helped by the fact that i had to sit through the most boring lessons and assembly! and now i am here writing about today! kinda odd! i bet when i get home i will not have fun! and i will probably go and revise on the computer and play games till late and have no dinner AGAIN! i hate food! it makes me to large tummied and i hate my tummy and bum! i need to loose weight! - i will go and run the 1500 tomorrow! (ok so i will probably not!) anyway we have a rounders match on thursday and saturday! so i will get fit then, and then go to the gym at the weekend! Anyway i will go and die now! cos i have been typing for ages!  ttyl hedge
