Well, he came home today so that means I've been around him for about three hours, seeing as he left. Three hours is waaay too long to be around him! His madness catches and we usually end up doing stupid stuff and blaming it on irish logic, ahh how weird. Ahh! I'm gonna be stuck with him for two weeks! Oh well, guess I'll just have to bribe him with chocolate like I did last year. Or tie him up... *grins a evil grin evilly* (How much grin and evil can you fit into one sentance?) If I was to grin an evil grin evilly then I'd evilly grin the evil grin with as much evil grin as I evilly could. (I had to ask) and I had to tell! *badumchee* See what I mean? And only after three hours! Ahh, I've had this up for ages time to click post  publish kiddies. Bisi!
