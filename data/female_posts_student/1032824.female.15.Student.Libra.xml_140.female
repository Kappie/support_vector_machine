My  husband  Geetha dear. * Smmmucks! * So anyways, Fiona and I attended the Chairperson/secretary workshop this morning before training, which was incredibly productive. Fiona cracked me up so badly I feel like gasing her to death some day.  Heil Hitler!   Heil!   Personally, training with the NCC boosted my morale. Sir Amir is  awesome . He's just... awesome! An incredible sir who's very teachable, motivating and diplomatic. I think it would be cool if our school had NCC - girls. I would be the first to sign up. Haha!   I love boys!  (Although I've told myself time and again that I'm ignoring guys for a year) Yet boys nowadays are so.. thoughtful! TS Faizal baked brownies for me, Jake got me a big pressie, Jason got me a soft toy, Brian purchased the  Black Eyed Peas  album and gave me a rose (part of the class V.day plan), Martin (Yulun) and Gabriel (Fengrui) got me the heart-shaped balloon and the finger puppets. And most importantly, the boys from the NCO squad (Sec 4/5) bought us roses! Thank you so much guys. You guys rock! CTNPCC rocks my socks!  Wenta' JJC's Love Fiesta with the chicks (Jess, Geets dear, Jiax, Kalyn) and dined at Marche (Orchard). The outing was totally, "HAHAHA!" My girls are such amiable and humourous people, I  really  am blessed, I truly love their company.   Anyways if Jenna hadn't gone home on yesterday's episode of  Survivor , she probably wouldn't forgive herself until the day she dies or something. Life is SO short.  8 days .. is a short time, but if spent wisely, many things can be done. I'm happy that Jenna made the right choice by pulling herself out of the game. Lotsa love.
