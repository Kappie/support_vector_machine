Dare you to move, Dare you to move, Dare you to lift yourself up off the floor, Dare you to move, Dare you to move, Like it never happened, Like it never happened before...   Okay...that's enough singing for now...I've been listening to  Switchfoot  like  crazy  lately...they're  really  good!  I didn't do crap today, I waxed the floors for my mom, I'm almost done, I've been doing it since 1:30 this afternoon...and it's now almost 10...so thats like almost  9  hours...geezums...  We ordered this ACT software for me so I can practice so hopefully that'll help my scores when I take the real deal...I have no idea where I have to take it, or when...yikes...might want to find that out...haha...but hopefully it'll help a good bit...  I'm on the fourth book of the Left Behind Series, I haven't been reading them lately...bad Brit...I started it last night while chatting on the net...and I'm more than half way done...like 200 somn pages...go bRiTbRo...haha  My Aunt Janice, Tanya, and Hunter came by....kinda annoying....feel like they're here only to tell us what we're doing wrong, and how superior they are...haha...oh don't they wish they were! They talked a lil bit about going to Tennessee again when it was just Aunt Janice and Hunter last night....I hope we do go, I don't know if they'd spoil it or not...but I  LOVE  that place!  That's all I really did today, the cleaning lady came, whoopie...we know how that goes...what an  exciting  day eyy??   Ohhh! and we got news from my dad...he's in the  Bahamas ! Lucky man! If only he wasn't working  we could join him down there....hmmmm
