Neil's grandmother came over from India, she earns her living, she pays her taxes, she owns her own house. However, I do agree that illegal immigrants should not be allowed in the country, as it really is taking the piss now.  I have to disagree with point number 2. "Eighty-seven per cent of the population of England and 96 per cent of the population of Wales gave their ethnic origin as White British."  If they are going to come over here, they should speak English, they should get a job, they should earn a living not hang around Croydon late at night not doing a lot. If you thank that's mean, Croydon has higher amounts of Asian or black than the national average. For example, black or black British in Croydon is 13.3%, in the whole country 2.1%.   urlLink  Source: 2001 Census, ONS
