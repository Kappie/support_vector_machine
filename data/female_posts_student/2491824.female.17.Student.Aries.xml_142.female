Just my first three classes (Science [which I failed last year b/c I am a lazy bum], Theatre2 [technical theatre], and English), which the thought of having to sit through them causes me to wake up in a bad mood on school days.  But Algebra (my 4th class), cheers me up. I love the logic and order and predictability. ...And the fact that I am good at it. ..that helps a lot... :) But, oh man my Drawing class (5th) is great. Why? Because I sit there and  draw ! (Right now we are doing perspective, and I'm not a fan of using rulers or anything I like. I like just using my eyes, so it's kind of boring for me now..) ...But you know what is great? Sandwiched (pun intended) in the middle of 5th period is my lunch. And I  love  the people that I sit with... Joanna, Amy, Aaron, David, Jeff, Harold... oh, it is so funny! So, there is very little chance that I am in a bad mood after lunch...  Then I go back and draw some more... In that class I sit with Cat and Allie. (She's straight-edge. oh yeah. mega-coolness.) Allie is so good at anything that involves artistic skills. Sometimes Cat and I just sit and watch her... until she notices that we are just stareing at whatever she's working on... Yeah, we're dorks... 20th Century U.S. History is next. I love that class! Mainly because I adore the subject, but also the teacher, Mr. Ramsey (who can be quite the asshole),  really knows his material and doesn't just teach the crap that is printed in the books. And he ties whatever we are learning about into current events (another of my favorite topics).  And 7th period, well, it's not great, but better than my first three... It's Theatre3 (acting). And we hardly do anything it that class. So, it's always a nice lazy way to end the day... Oh, oh today most of the class got in a really heated discussion about eating meat.. It started out as being about not being cruel to animals or something like that... Andrew (straight-edge and a vegetarian) had the only logical argument even though I'm not all about vegetarianism...  ...Alright I might write more later... My aunt is coming to pick me up to go out to dinner...
