He made it out of surgery fine, they ended up having to remove 3/4 of his small intestine, he will never be able to play football again, he is going to have a very long recovery, but he has made progress!! his brain activity was only at 30 and now it is up to 66, so he is a little more aware of what is goin on! but He is an extremely strong guy, so we know he will pull through! We'll be up there again real soon to check on him again, and i'll keep ya updated!! Keep him in your prayers!! love you all!- bRiTtAnY-
