So far it's good but it's definitely shattering my perfect image of Redford.  They have good things to say about him, yes, but they definitely have their opinion of what he's done to damage the subject as well.  But you think they rip at Redford?  Try how bad they go on about Harvey and Bob Weinstein.  They make those brothers seem like they should be wielding axes as they walk around their offices in New York City.  I haven't finished the book but if you have any interest in the subject it's actually a pretty fascinating and candid book.  The author definitely doesn't sugar coat or hold back opinions if they show someone in a negative light.
