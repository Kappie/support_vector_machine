Just in case u ppl havent seen, my cousin added in a comments section to my blog 4 me so u can comment on my...stuff....that i write......be sure to check back because i'll write down an answer too.  u can also read other ppl's comments.  In order to do these, look under the entry that u wish 2 comment and u should see something that says comments (0) the number in ( ) means the number of comments i got on that one ( Mr. Aimers is going to kill me 4 using these dull verbs) .  By the way, Fhrank you, Owlan! ( His real name's Alan but i've called him Owlan since my brother pronounces it that way...He's lucky that i didnt say Alanna cuz once when he was about my age, he made a spelling mistake on his name...yep...thatz rite he accidentally spelled his name like Alanna!)  By the way (again), he is now in university and he's not stupid anymore (hmm....) his blog is http://hisbloodbringshope.blogspot.com =)
