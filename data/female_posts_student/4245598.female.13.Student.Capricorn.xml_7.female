I'm really pissed off cuz i kept forgetting my username n hav to make a new one :/..well just went back frm sch.tired.no hmk today which is good. life is difficult for me cuz my parents are police.. everyone will be saying so wud right? BUT if u live with my parents..u won't last a day. wud can i say it's fated. it's like getting grounded everyday and everything i do seems to be wrong. well at sch i found out a frend of mine was reading my book..not any book but a special one. it's not a journal or anything like that cuz those r for girls who r lonely and alone. mine is filled with songs i wrote and a long story..dunno whether my songs r good but wud u expect from a 12yrs old right? but my friends says it's good. ONLY special friends are allowed. Some ppl just can't keep their nose to themselves. lol..just now my friend told another one to piss off. the person didn't knw wud that was so she was totally puzzled. I'm goin for guitar lessons and the end of the year when my final exams r over. that the time when i'll be totally happy but the results it's scary cuz with the  results,  it determines which sch ur gonna go. If i don't get the sch i want, i will be told to go to an all girls sch.lame. there's no excitement. just imagine if u say u want to skate all the girls will be like sheesh ur a girl and u want to skate. skating are for boys. if that girl doesn't stop that instant, i will punch her face but by doing that i will get into more trouble. sigh . well life.
