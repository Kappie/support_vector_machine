No I am pretty good at the program my 'employer' had me working on. I like WORD it's always good to me. I'm going to watch the wizard of Oz now and probably edit after that. it won't be done though. Still I'll try to get a book to my Bethie tomorrow. It'll probably be the pillars of creation. I'm almost done my book as well.   Ok the wizard of Oz DVD opening sequence is getting to me I have to go now.
