And well I've decided that I need a behavior makeover.  Also I need to not make stupid inferences that no one understands and leads to others thinking I'm completely insane.  Starbucks was fun.  I appreciated it (nodds head).  I'm one of the 326BCs.  And Becca, Bella and I will do something extremely crazy on February 28 at 11:30 pm on my front lawn.  And probably invite some people over for Hazelnut (Klingon quotation fingers) Coffee.  Sounds fun, doesn't it?  And just for the record the trash can fell on me, I did not jump into it.
