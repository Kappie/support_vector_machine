We went out 2 the field and we started catching bees. But then we stopped cuz Crystal got stung! hah. So then we got bored and Doug told us that we should spin in circles so we did. Yeah and we got really dizzy! But it was soooo cool! I felt like i was goin crazy. I bet that's what it feels like when ur drunk. Ya so that was my interesting day.
