I congratulated myself on graduating and asked a bunch of questions.  urlLink  FutureMe  is this nifty service where you can email a note to yourself in the future -- even a few years later.    I wish you could send one backwards instead of only forward in time.  But then, I have always wanted to talk to an earlier me, even when I was a kid.  Beck and I seem to be doing the living together thing okay.  It's hard, because she has mono (way to start off, isn't it?).    My graduation money is paying our bills right now.  I was a little bitter about it, because I had allowed myself to dream about what I could do with the money.  Oh, well.  I should know better.  I know what it means to be poor.  Using cash gifts for not-bills is a luxury only available to people who have enough money to pay their bills in the first place.  *sigh*
