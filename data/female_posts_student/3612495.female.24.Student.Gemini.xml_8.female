Also I just want Gavin to support me all the times. No matter what had happened, he will give a hand to me. Also, what had happened to him, I also always stay near him to support him.  This is the first examination in Australia, I dont know whether are there any difficult with Hong Kong. I wish it will be easier than Hong Kong, I am scare very very much.  明天是我的第一個考試，好緊張。但我心中不祈求有好高的分數，只求科科合格，那麼我已經好開心。此外，我希望Gavin會時時刻刻都支持我。不論有什麼事發生，他都會伸出援手，幫助我。而當他需要的時候，有什麼事發生係他身上，我也會一定在他身邊支持他。  明天係第一次在澳洲的正式考試，唔知會同香港的有什麼不同。但願比香港的容易，可是始終都好緊張。
