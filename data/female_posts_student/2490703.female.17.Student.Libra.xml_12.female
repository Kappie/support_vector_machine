I was supposed to go up to CMU today to get a job thing, but I changed my schedule around so I have 4 day weekends and classes 3 days a week. Yeah, mom. She helped me. All I have to worry about is if the transfer. I'm so excited for college now, other than the fact that I'm not going to see Ryan as much anymore. I'll see him when I go to MSU because it's closer to home. Sadly, I'm going to have to live at home for a little bit because housing around there is so expensive. It's kind of crappy. But, I'll be closer to most of my friends, They are all going to MSU or LCC so it'll be okay. I have so many jobs to apply for tomorrow. I found this one a coffee shop. It sounds like a really cute job. Then I have an interview at banana Republic tomorrow. And I have an Application for Kohl's. So I hope I can get a good job so I can actually have money to spend on things other than college. All I can say is welcome to being a poor college student. But yeah. I have to go. Talk to you soon!  Peace and Love, Melissa
