But it would simply be nice to have a space to myself in which to work.  We're consistently bumping chair backs, as the space isn't big enough for the both of us.  This will soon be rectified as we'll be changing spaces soon (thank God).   But not soon enough.  Of course it doesn't help to feel that my current officemate doesn't particularly like me...she's one of those people with an extremely dry sense of humor and a deadpan personality such that you really don't know what she really thinks.   She gets really defensive about some stuff (Stephen King, being a Republican...), and somehow always seems disapproving of me.  Not that I can come up with any reason WHY she should disapprove of me.  I'll just chalk it up to the fact she doesn't really know me all that well, nor I her.   Spent a long time in my boss's office this morning going over my project for the morning.  He can't seem to find a happy medium between treating me as completely ignorant of statistical methods (I'm not) and completely versed.  I know I've been out for a while, but I'm not competely stupid.  I'm looking forward to classes starting so that I can prove myself.   Had a fabulous visit over tea and a piece of shared cheesecake last night with my friend Marion.  She's one of those people with whom it's almost impossible to break off a conversation.  We really enjoy each other's company.  We were just getting to really know each other before I moved last October and sometimes I wonder if she's one of the reasons I was meant to move back.  I go off on these kicks where I absolutely HAVE to believe that everything happens for a reason.  Probably because my life these last few years has been so chaotic.   Okay, okay...I really must get to the number crunching.  I've finished my cuppa soup (chicken noodle soup...what a breakfast...it was the only thing in my drawer to eat) and need to get going.  Yours, Maggie  P.S. Marion made a rather brilliant (well obvious but brilliant because it never occurred to me) suggestion on how I could still have my afternoon tea at work (the problem being that the coffee club here evidently all drink their coffee black so no sugar or milk available).  Powdered milk!  Once she said it, I was like  DUH!  Of course!  So I bought some last night and as of approximately 3:30 this afternoon hope to be enjoying a cuppa Irish Breakfast Tea.  I'll have to bring my afternoon teas another day.
