I was beginning to believe that Bush had already hatched his evil plan to block out the sun in the erudite northeast. I bet everyone's outside in hot pants and tank tops right now. I, on the other hand, am relishing the urban dreary of my room (the antidote for shabby chic, no doubt) by revising those nearly finished (yay?) grant proposals. Oh, I'll also be combing online news to provide you with up-to-date commentary on the issues that matter to YOU. What should be next? The Olympics?
