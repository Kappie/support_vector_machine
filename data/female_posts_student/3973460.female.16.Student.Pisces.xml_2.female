Ahh, Dashboard Confessional. How I love thee. It's such a pretty song, and even better, it's the theme song to my favorite movie of the summer.         So, my day? Well, let's see. I ended up going on the swim trip at work in the morning. It was really easy, but the campers were being annoying. I am officially sick of cards! GRRARGHH. So, we get back, eat lunch. OH, but right before we ate lunch, my brother comes running up to me, crying, and shows me that his pants ripped--by his crotch. Thank the lord Tom had an extra pair of shorts and my brother wore them for the rest of the day. I felt bad, I was laughing. I'm such a horrible big sister! So yea. We eat lunch and I bought a green apple/sky blue icee! Yummmm. Then it was time for "mid-summer staff evaluations". I was scared to find out how I did, but Andrea and Chris said that I'm doing absolutely great, so that was a sigh of relief. I was wearing my tank top today, and I had a halter bathingsuit on under it, and this one little brat decides to untie it. I didn't even notice she did it until my bathing suit top was starting to slip. I yelled at her and she said that she didn't know the top was going to do that. GRRR. If she wasn't a 9 year old crybaby, I would open a can of whoopass on her, I swear! She also pulled a whole thing of my hair out because "something" was in it. Let me inform you, that "something" was really just a piece of lint. *insert very mad smiley face* Well, that sums up my day. Stringer told me about Cornerstone yesterday and how he was going to play, and I feel bad I missed it. I wasn't sure if any of my friends were going to go to watch, and no one called me and told me they were (besides the Tropia, but that was like 5 minutes before the thing started). So yea, I hope no one is mad at me or anything. Okay, I'm out! Woot.     -Jen
