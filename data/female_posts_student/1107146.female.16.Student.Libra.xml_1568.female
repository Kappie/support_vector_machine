Just watch as I walk in with a $1000 Italian suit and slicked-back short hair. Heheheh. I just got done watching  Casablanca ...what a badass movie...and I'll talk about it more on mine. But it was SO L337.  And I've heard a lot about said Last of the Mohicans, so I probly should join this limited frenzy and say "OOH OOH ME TOO". My days consist mostly of watching old movies...that was today's choice, along with old episodes of South Park, which has become the funniest and most disgusting show ever.  I'm a little better. But I'm getting really fat cuz I haven't been running (DRUGS!) so yah...I got addicted to NyQuil, it was a lot of fun trying to quit. And stuff.  Here's looking at you, kids. Tata.
