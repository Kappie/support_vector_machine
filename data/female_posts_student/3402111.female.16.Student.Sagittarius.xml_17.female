And others you can't wait to get away from.  Some who will overcome great odds and some who will get past their personal obstacles.     And then there is that someONE.  The some one who makes you happy, sad, and angry.  Someone who surprises you beyond belief yet is still predictable. Someone you can't live with or bear to be without.  Someone who overcomes all odds.       There is a wide variety of people.  Many you will get along with.  Most of whom will be simply aquaintances.  A few will be opponents.  And even fewer will become the ones you will always be able to turn to and depend on.  But all of them make a dent in your life.  Mold a little bit of it like a ball of clay.  Sooner or later to become a final product.... you.
