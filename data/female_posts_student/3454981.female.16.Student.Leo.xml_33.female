Today I had to attend a funeral. I hate funerals but then again, who does like them? This one was for the grandfather (to some of them he was a father) of a family who is friends with our family.I never really met him but he seemed like a really fun guy. Theyhad pictures of him  everywhere , but they also had an open casket during the visitation time. That is the part of funerals I hate the most--when people die, they are gone.No matter whatreligion you are or you practice it is commonly known that basically the soul of someone is gone, and so is any remnant of life. So what is the use of trying to make them look like they're living? I know this sounds very cold and heartless, but I too, have had many relatives die--especially within the last 2 years and I know it's tough.However, filling them with formaldehyde and trying to make them look like they were is really pointless. They are not like they were beforebecause they are not living. But I guess I know deep inside that people do need to have that last glance at a loved one so they can really 'let go' so to speak. I just hate how it is after someone dies. I am not afraid of dying, butI do hate the lingeringaura of death. My thoughts are too contradictory that Ithink I willresume writing later.
