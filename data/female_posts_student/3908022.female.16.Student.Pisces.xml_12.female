Instead of going shopping for things I actually need. I choose to sit here, alone.  How much fun is that on a scale from one to ten?     One and a half.     But at least today I'm going to call Linnea. I promised to call her a week ago, when I came home from Italy. But that just didn't happen. Today it will, though. I've got to talk to her. I feel like such a bad friend for not calling her. :(  And what can I do about my room? It's so ugly! :D I want to make changes. But there's to much wrong about it. I can't just change a little, I have to change alot. And I don't think I have the money to do that. So, maybe I shouldn't change it. I could just keep it ugly.  Yeah, I'll keep it ugly. Who cares?   I do.
