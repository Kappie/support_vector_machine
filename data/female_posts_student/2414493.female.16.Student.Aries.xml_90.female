I don't know why I'm feeling so awfully happy, but here's my conjectures: panel's over and Mr. Francis didn't get the eval back yet so consequently he isn't as pissed as he could be, and I've gotten home safe without feeling like crap. I did a new layout on the front page in journalism (haha yes, there's a front page now) and there's at least 50% of the teaser pictures and everything seems to be falling together. And it's getting warm again. Enduring hot weather just reminds me of the Davis Days and walking into Tercero with helmet in hand, sweat running down in rivulets. Just the smell and the feel...and I can almost expect to take out my key (234) and stick it in the door and come into the stairwell. And there was good food for dinner: tofu, chicken...just the way it's meant to be always.  But yeah. I'm sitting here without burdens, and boy does it feel good. Journalism's actually working out for a change, and I only need to sort out little minor details until I can get everything finished, and hopefully I'll still have time to do a bit of copy editing. haha, I can't stop thinking about how I love the front page design...it's at least different from the usual hi, here's a picture on the right (right? which way's right? from the physio lab), and I just need a good cute picture and a good solid article. Please, I beg. Ruego. Suplico. All I have to do is do hw and shower and little minor stuff, and then I can go to bed a happy girl.  I should hear from none other than Harvard within a week. Fantastic!  Design, design, design. Things are by design.
