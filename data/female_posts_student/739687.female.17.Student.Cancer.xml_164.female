My family always tells me how I used to be so happy, and how they wish I would be like that again. How they "want that person back." And I don't know what to do. What  am  I supposed to do?   I can't do anything.     If people would just stop pointing out to me how unhappy I am, then maybe I could ignore it a little more.
