Woke up late, beat up my brother for singing songs out of tune and teasing me (the older one, of course), got dressed, and then took Christopher to the park to play. Strangely enough, we met a lady there who had two sons named Matthew and Christopher. Now what are the odds of that? But those names are also pretty common, and they're both Christian names, so I guess it's not that unlikely.  After that I took Christopher out for some Baskin Robbins ice cream, and now I'm here, more bored than ever. Anyone up for hanging out tonight?
