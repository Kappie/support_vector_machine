All I can say is that it was hard, very hard - but I'm rather optimistic. I would love to discuss it further, but I had to "swear" not to disclose any information, and writing about it here would most definately do so.  The drive up was completely uneventful. It was very nice to see my  Aunt Mary  (being that I took the exam at  Emory , I stayed with her, being only 15 min. from there).    MY MOTHER DRIVES ME NUTS . Okay, here is the "gist" of it... I was supposed to hang out with  Jason Royal  Saturday night (in the long run it had to be canceled - however that is not what this entry is about.) I told Mom that I would be out very late, and I would not accept any curfew. She replied  "There is no curfew as long as you are on the premises" . WTF??? What the hell does that mean? How the hell can I have "college fun" at my parents house - that place so often is a prison. What would we do there... uh.... watch a movie? eat ice cream? play with the dog? talk about college life in front of the parents? I don't think-a-so. So I pushed her a bit more to see what was going on, and basically she said,  I WOULD HAVE A CURFEW . Here is what I don't get:   I'm 23 I've traveled Europe on my own I have two jobs I'm in college AND SHE WANTS ME TO HAVE A CURFEW???   GRRRRRRRRR. No wonder I didn't have a dating life in high school. A note to all parents out there, when your kid is 23, NOOOOOO CURRRRFEW!  UGH. As you can see, this has really pissed me off.   ON ANOTHER NOTE:   I almost adopted a puppy this weekend.  She was sooo cute. I finally decided though, I really do not need to get a puppy on finals week. (Irene, you will be glad to know she was not a large breed dog.) Man, if my mom gets upset over curfews, I can only imagine what she would have said about a puppy.  Before I left home, Mom decided to "check my tires". Of course, they had to be a few pounds low, and by the time they were fixed, an HOUR had passed. Grr.   As I left my parent's house on Sunday, I passed my neighbor  Preston . I pulled over to say hello (suburbia-life). She said to me,  "All of a sudden you look so grown-up".  Hm.... Do I look old? I thought it was sweet, at which point I told her to mention that to my mother next time they see each other (hehe).    YAY!!!!!!!!!! The FSE is over!    Thats it for now.
