Since this is only a scrap don't be to surprised if it is rough at points. So without further ado:   Conceptual Holism   The possession of a concept consists in the existence of a node at a particular place in a network of concepts (i.e. a conceptual scheme). A consequence of defining a concept this way is that it commits us to a conceptual holism (in contrast to a conceptual atomism): no person can possess a single concept; concepts only come in sets. Just as a move in chess cannot exist apart from the whole game, there is no concept of red apart from a network of color concepts. Concepts, however, do not consist solely of their relationships in a network. Only the first ingredient is a concept’s unique place in a network. The second and final ingredient is that this particular node in a network belongs to a conceptual network, and a network is only a conceptual network if the network plays a certain role in a person’s form of life. Just as a pawn consists partly in its location in the network “chess”, but also partly in the network chess’ place as a game in our form of life.   To illustrate, imagine a board game where we assign certain English phrases to differently colored pieces: blue for “hello”, red for “good-bye”, etc. Then using the rules of a conversation, e.g. “Game begins with both player putting forth a blue piece,“ we play out a conversation. Perhaps in the game a player can win if they force their opponent into placing the colored piece representing “I’m wrong, your right.” To us this can only partly be a game; knowing what the pieces stood in for we could hardly avoid letting the game also function as a linguistic interaction. But suppose we go on to teach others the game without revealing to them that each colored piece represents an English phrase, or that the rules of the game govern the colored pieces just as the rules of conversation govern the phrases the pieces (covertly) represent. These new players are engaging in the same rules as our language and the blue piece node still holds the same place in the network as “hello,” but playing that piece is no longer saying “hello.” The difference between the original players and the newcomers is in the role that the whole network plays. The statement “hello” only partly consists in its location in the network, the other component is what role the network plays in our form of life and that is what the second group of players is missing which deprives the blue piece of its status as the statement “hello.”  Looking to chess again, we can ask two questions that will have analogous answers for concepts: what makes an action a move in the network chess, and what makes the network that of the game chess? Taking on the former question first: What makes an event a node in a network as opposed to a simple isolated event? For example, a pawn’s location on a chess board can be changed both by making a move in the game of chess or by an accidental bump from a careless passerby. In the first case the response is one that enters a network, is a move in the game chess; in the accident case my response is disconnected from any network.   The difference is that from the in-game move there are further moves now stand in different relations to one another than before the pawn was moved. Certain further moves become “good” moves and will lead to a “win”; certain moves will result in a piece being taken off the board; certain moves will lead me to exclaim “Blast!” while scrunching up my face in anger. In contrast, after bumping the table there are no further changes in the pawn’s location that become “good” moves. Unless, of course, apologizing to the players and putting the piece back where it originally stood is a “good“ move. That, however, puts the pawn’s change in location when the passer-by bumped the table into a different network than the one of chess--the network of manners.    Now we have a move in a network, but what makes my actions a move in chess is only partly the move’s place in the network “chess.” The network must also be a game, and what makes chess a game is the network’s role in our form of life. That there is nothing produced by playing the game, unlike building a house, is part of what makes it a game. Another important part is that in normal cases chess is played for enjoyment, though not in all. If a game was not played for enjoyment in most cases, it would cease to be a game.   Learning Concepts   A concept or a pawn can take on any physical form, and cannot be reduced to any particular physical form. They are roles things can take on, not things. It is how we behave towards the physical cut of wood or the neural pattern that makes it either a pawn or a concept.   There are certain moves from a stimulus to a response that to get from one to the other there must be an inference. When this happens we can say whatever has gone on in the brain during the intervening time between input and output is the physical instantiation of the inference (like a wood piece is the physical instantiation of a pawn). Once said, this statement must immediately be qualified a little since strictly speaking we only mean the stuff happening in the brain that is causally linked to both the input and output.   If a stimulus sets in motion a set of moves from one node to another (perhaps a brain state), and then finally to a response--then it is a conceptual network. Just as the “white bishop” node in chess is both a physical cut of wood and the non-physical “white bishop.” The concept may be shown by science one day to consist of a brain state or perhaps some mental substance or (if we adopt a crude behaviorism) solely a set of behaviors, but this only reduces concepts to their physical form in the way a pawn may be reduced to its physical form. As in chess, concepts need not have the same physical form so long as they function the same in the network and the network as a whole functions the same in the overall form of life.    Simple stimulus-response connections are not concepts, but in acquiring a conceptual scheme a person must first be trained to have certain simple stimulus-response connections. We are, of course, born with a few stimulus-response connections built-in, e.g. crying when hurt, but these must be multiplied if we hope to build a conceptual scheme from them. It is these inborn connections we depend on to train the further stimulus-response connections needed for a conceptual scheme. Since a child has the inborn response to repeat actions that bring about sweet food or an adult’s smile, this can be used to train new stimulus-response connections. (Wittgenstein)  To acquire color concepts a person need respond to different colors with a different response. Let us say that when a child sees red or blue certain neurons in a child’s brain fire. In actual child raising this response does not work because the adult cannot reinforce or show disapproval to this stimulus-response connection. To raise a child the response normally relied upon is verbal utterances, since an adult can hear the child’s utterance and show approval or disapproval depending on if the child has had the right response. Neural activity might be used if we had the proper equipment to know what the child’s neural responses to stimulus were.    Assuming this equipment were available, a child might be shown disapproval for having a certain neural response to blue and shown approval for having a certain neural response to red. Eventually the child will come to have one response only to red items, if not they become classified as mentally retarded; lacking the inborn stimulus-response relations needed for teaching the further stimulus-response connections for a conceptual scheme.  Over time the child might be trained to have different specific neural responses to a set of different colors (e.g. blue, red, and green). This is not yet having the concepts of these colors, but closer to a parrot’s trainability to utter certain words in response to certain stimulus. Concepts arise only when these simple stimulus-response connections become connected to one another into a network. Suppose the child has the neural activity of red when shown a blue tie under intense red lighting, and then we switch to white lighting and the child has the neural activity of blue. If this is the end of the story we are still in the territory of parrots and thermostats, simple stimulus-response connections. If, however, the child is confused because what was once red is now blue, something significant has occurred. In addition to responding to colored objects, the child is confused when objects spontaneously change color. This additional part of the child’s brain that invokes confusion when confronted with spontaneous color changes is one of the needed elements to turn the mere response to a color into a conceptual response. When the response is integrated into a network of elements invoking, e.g., confusion for spontaneous changes, that the child’s responses become more conceptual. Here we might be able to say the child has acquired a set of concepts containing rudimentary versions of colors, objects and causation.   The question might be asked how a neural state can both be a response and a conceptual response; how can a neural state be a concept? A concept is not a physical thing. How can the scientist tell us the concept of redness a pattern of neurons? Surely we would find it much more intuitive if we were told that the concept of red consisted in some mental image of red or some non-physical, platonic “thing” that our mind touches when it contemplates redness. But concepts can be physical in the same way a piece of wood can both be a piece of wood and a pawn depending on its role in a network. A pawn is a certain place in a network of physical things which are at that time taking on the role of the chess network in our form of life.   Still, the cognitive scientist is bound for trouble if they try to identify concepts with neural patterns completely. Part of the problem is that we do not use neural patterns to teach a child concepts, but instead their behavior. A child may sometimes have neural pattern-A when they report “red” and sometimes be in neural state-B, but this is unimportant to if they have the concept of red. In fact, the neural state when the child utters “red” could never repeat itself--always be different. But if the child still responds “red” only to red objects and still can become confused when red objects magically turn blue, then they have the concept of red. Just as having a concept is not a feeling (Wittgenstein), nor is it a neural state.   Think if chess had always been played with a pawn of a certain shaped wood, and now someone  made the claim that a pawn is merely a piece of wood of a certain shape. This is a category mistake, and the same mistake the cognitive scientist makes by identifying a concept with the neural pattern normally (if not always) associated with that concept. Wittgenstein reveals in his Philosophical Investigations that concept possession, language possession, acts of reading, acts of thinking, acts of intending are all further cases where they can only be reduced to neural states in the same sense a pawn can be said to be a piece of shaped wood. Wittgenstein’s main target is those who try to identify these things with a certain feeling, mental image or first-person experience, but his criticism applies equally to the over zealous cognitive scientist. Wittgenstein himself, of course, saw this as well.
