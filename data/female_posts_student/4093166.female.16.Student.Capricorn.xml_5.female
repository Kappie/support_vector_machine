Last day of band camp was yeaterday and we have all of our show on the field.  I am excited because it is a fun show.  My ex-boyfriends sister had a wreck the other day, she cracked somthing in her neck and is wearing a brace.  As much as I don't like my ex, I'm still friends with her, so I hope she gets better soon.  She flipped the truck 3 times then went end over end 2 times.  I would have been soo scared. Lol.  I have lost weight like I thought I would, so I'm happy in that department also.  All of my burns have went to tans and my ears are healing.  So I guess life is pretty good right now.  Well, I have to go do some chores (yuck).  I'll try to write more later. Jami
