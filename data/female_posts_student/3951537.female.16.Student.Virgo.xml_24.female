Plus, no one cares if you miss classes. Well, at least I don't care. I don't know about the rest of you. But miss work, man, you are dead. Responsibility sucks. So the point of this post is that, see, if you're one of those few people who might care what's going in my life, well, here ya go. I am going to sleep. As soon as I eat something, I'm going to bed. At 730 pm. And I'm going to wake up on time, dag namnit. I don't lead a very eventful life, but Emily made me swear not to abandon this blog. I promised that if I did, I would have to be banned from photoshop for an entire month. I'm sure as hell tired enough to go to sleep. I'm spacing out.  there  are  big  gaps  in  my  thought processes   no, i'm not on drugs. speaking of which, the advil is calling me. farewell.
