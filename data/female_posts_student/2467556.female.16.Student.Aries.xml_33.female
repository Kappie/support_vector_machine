I feel really bad though because after the second perod when after we were doing so well and we started losing because Calgary was up 2-1.....i didn't watch the 3rd period and i went to sleep.  And then they went off and won.  Oh well.  Stars play Vancouver on Monday, so that should be interesting to watch considering they're losing to teams they shouldn't be...*cough sanjose cough*.....but yeah anyways.  Niko was doing great!!!!  Oh man last night was awesome.  They put Niko on the tv before commercial then they showed my FAVORITE COMMERCIAL of all time (the Coors Light Wingman commercial) and then when they came back to the game Niko was on the TV again!!!  It doesn't get much better than that folks.  I officially love ESPN and Fox Sports Net.  Mike Modano did rather well considering his "groin injury" from his "strenuous" skating.  whatever, he did alright.  I know i don't talk about football often.....more like never....but here we go.  The New England Patriots and their EXTREMELY HOT quarterback, Tom Brady, (oh god save me, i think a football player is hot) are going to the Super Bowl.  That report was made especially for Brittany Pleau, being the proud half Bostonian and half Canadian that she is.    I didn't really do anything today.....except watch my mom book our vacation over spring break to Williamsburg, Virginia.  oh joy.  Brittany says its an awesome place but i'm just mad about how my mom picked that option over the MUCH COOLER options we had.  Lets see our options were: Finland, Norway, Sweden, England, Ibiza, Spain, Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, France, the Carribbean......and she picks frickin VIRGINIA.  aaaaaaaagh! oh well, whatever.  At least there's no hot guys in Virginia, lol.  i might be going to hang out at someone's house tonight, but i dunno......ttyl  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~
