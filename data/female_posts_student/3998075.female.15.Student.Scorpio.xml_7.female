I always go for the guys who are always gonna hurt me. Or do i always screw it up some how on my own...i just don't know what is wrong with me...everytime i see something good for myself..i push it away...i guess i'm just ment for lonliness...but whatever.....i'm over it....all of it....and everyone involved in it.
