Does it worry or excite you that there are girls that want to undress you to find out if they are boxers, or briefs, or boxer-briefs; praying it's nothing, easy to make you feel naked even if you're still wearing a t-shirt and jeans. Does it comfort you, or uncomfort you (for that matter), to know that the more you cover up the more I want to bare you, exposing items that can be used for the most taboo acts. But you can tie my up or dress me down, nude or clothed, with goosebumps unconditional. To reach inside, to divide time and space, to mesh feelings as well as chemicals. And if you want to grab me and hold me down like the weak, meek girl I am, I would only be able to find such similar and contradictory actions in dreams, frivolous yet again. But like Moses parting the Red Sea, you would be able to separate, segregate words from thoughts, and comic from truth. As they say, "actions speak louder than words," and the words that can roll off the tip of your tounge, can whip around, stabbing, darting, not willing to come out with the squeek most attribute to butterflies. Butterflies are too beautiful to describe the feeling ever time you smack me with your words, I'm left speechless as always. Moths, worms, roaches, and grubs are thrown up with anxiety, like when Cisco held my hair back, I'm always so shy. Atleast we agree on one thing. Eager eyes peer into your fish bowl but only privately disguised behind a pathetic excuse for a smile and a pair of binoculars. I'm scared to release information that could potentially interrupt or create a tremor underneath you Earth and my skin. I'd love to crawl through you mind or take a bite out of your emotions. I salivate in anticipation ready for the meat, ready for the kill. All I must do is wait, but as the minutes turn to hours, hours to days, weeks, months, and years, I am impatient. I'm dying, I realize I am as quiet as a firefly but just as efficient at lighting that space in between a dark heart and crying eyes. I feel as if I am in the palm of your hand but ready for both truth and lies to serenade my presence. But just as those words could drive me to the edge I know how to take a step back and look at the surroundings that seem larger than life. A hand, a back, a face... all with a flick or whip of wind can sent careening off cliffs and diving into an ocean of blue... you.
