I'll try to create strategies that address all the obstacles for each problem.    How to make sure that I'll get to work before 8:30am?  - Post a sheet on the wall behind my pillows to check that I get up before 7:30am every morning when I need to go to work. Every time that I fail to achieve this goal, donate $5 to poor children through the Overseas China Education Foundation (www.ocef.org/newocef).   - I need to cut down the "just a few more minutes" thoughts for all of these problems. Pinch my arm every time that this kind of though occur to me again.    How to cut down the time that I spend passively browsing the web or watching TV?  - Read an article today about internet addiction, which actually really should be called internet dependence. "Dependence is characterized by obsessiveness, loss of control, continued use despite adverse consequences, and inability to stop even if a person wants to." "It is estimated that employee Internet misuse and abuse cause over four billion dollars in lost work productivity." The internet prevents an escape from the real life's problems and challenges.  - Establish an Internet Addiction Recovery Excel sheet. Every time that I'm able to curb my impluse to go on the internet, I get a plus. Everything that I'm not able to curb my impluse, and it's OK to be honest about that, I get a cross. I also need to write down what I'm escaping from, what the consequence is, and how long did I end up wasting. Visualize the positive and negative consequenses while I'm doing this. At the end of the day, treat myself a great dinner if I'm able to achieve the goal. Otherwise, do 20 push ups or run for 20 minutes for every extra hour that I spent online.
