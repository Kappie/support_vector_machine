I just got back from being beeped to attend to two deaths.  At first I thought it was three, but the 3rd was just a repeat of the first.  So, how am I as a hospital chaplain to attend to families who have just watched a loved one die.  The first family I had met before on my floor.  They got ping-ponged between my general medical/surgical floor and the intensive care unit (ICU) for at least the past two weeks.  They'd be on my floor for a few days, then back in ICU depending on how the family member was progressing or regressing.  I hadn't talked to the family beyond a 45-second check-in over the past week because I didn't want to make them nervous.  I find that folks, even folks of great faith, get a little antsy when faced with constant chaplain visits.  I think we all think  "How bad am I really if this pastor/priest/chaplain keeps coming by?  Aren't there other people who need her/him more?   Well, this patient just died.  The patient was surrounded by family and spouse and children.  I went up and said a few prayers.  I didn't even say as many as I meant to because I made a pause and they said "Thanks."  So I stayed for a bit.  Then moved to the second beep.  This was another person who had died.   Expired  in hospital parlance.  I had talked to the family earlier.  Even brought in the on-call priest from the local Catholic parish to administer the  urlLink Anointing of the Sick .  This patient was going to die pretty soon.  And they did.  I spoke with the family again.  One of the patient's children was being very efficient in contacting funeral homes.  The other relatives had only recently driven in to the hospital today.  They had been by last night, though.  They made it in time to be with the patient before death, so that was good.  I said a few prayers -- once again, not all the ones I intended.  Stayed for a bit and moved on.  So my questions, at what point do my prayers become ineffective as pastoral care?  These prayers I'm speaking of specifically come from the  urlLink Occasional Services  for the Lutheran Book of Worship.  I've had few occasions to use them in CPE.  But usually one of two things have happened.  1. I don't get through the entire intended rite.  I try to make a significant pause, and folks think it's done.  So I just pack it up.  2. I get all the way through it, and it feels so inadequate.  I could probably fix situation 1 by becoming more familiar with the rites.  I want to feel like we're paying significant and proper homage to the person and the event.  If the family is fine with the Lord's Prayer, I'm fine with that.  Maybe that's all that's needed.  Perhaps I can always start a rite by saying, we'll end with the Lord's Prayer and try to read the crowd as to how much prayer they're receptive to.  But part of me says, that's just me wanting to play a bigger role in their grief.  If they're people of faith, they'll be praying and prayed over a lot.  My little words, even if they were carefully chosen by a group of ELCA worship gurus, don't mean a whole lot in the grand scheme of things.  In situation 2, that feels as if it's just the inadequacy of responding to people's needs.  I still feel like I should try harder and be more open.  I don't feel as sorry for people when I'm the chaplain that shows up, but I still feel it.  These words are wonderful.  They're part of the faith proclaimed by the ancient and future church.  But they're still just words.  And I'm still just a speaker.
