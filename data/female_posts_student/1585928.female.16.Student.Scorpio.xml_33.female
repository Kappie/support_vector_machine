He told us that ketchup was $1.25 everytime you used some!, haha, and the sad part about it was... Julise BeLiEvEd him!! haha yea what a D.A!! lol j/k... okay friday DAY.. me and Julie went to byram and on the way back from my house (in Julie's car) this red explorer passed us.. filled with BoYs!! they FLAG US DOWN in the MIDDLE OF HER STREET!! haha it was crazyy!! turns out it was Jamie, Josh, and David! three REALLY sweet guys! they got my number and told us about a party later that night.. okay so we got dressed at Julie's house and then went to pick up Gracie and Laura Beth.. we went to Margaritas to eat with Paul, Brice, Wesley*, Robby, Zach, and Matt..(SoCcEr BoYs FrOm DeSoTo) after we ate me and Julie left and went to see Derek, Rowdy, Robert, Cary, Kurt, and Jet at Wendy's.. well when we get there, we saw Ben, Casey, Michael C., Michael H., Taylor, Harrison, David, Louis and  Nathan up there too.. we talked to everybody for a while.. Derek almost got an M.I.P. for smoking.. but he got out of it!! =) well after that.. we went and picked Gracie and Laura Beth back up and took them home.. and then we went over to BrEnToN'S!! him and Jarrod were there in the hot tub.. lol They gave us some of brenton's old clothes and told us to get in.. haha! we didn't of course!... so we finally made them get out.. only after we counted how long they can each hold their breath (jarrod can hold his breath for 58 seconds... brenton can hold his breath for a min. 30)... so then we went upstairs and watch "the missing"... it was weird! .. haha.. well then we left there and went to byram to Josh's house.. it was us, Jamie, Robby, Rowdy Buck, his girlfriend Kristen, David, Johnny, and some girl we didn't know! LaTeR we all loaded up and went to Waffle House.. hahaha!! ok.. Saturday.. nothing much went on during the day... until around 5.. me, Julie, gracie, and Laura Beth went to the DeSoto boys' soccer game.. they won 4-0 i think.. and then Me and Julie went to eat at applebees with Amanda and Amy.. we saw Matt up there.. he's soo sweet!!! well we left there and went and saw derek and cary.. talked to them a while.. went and got Gracie from Laura Beth's.. she stn with us that night.. later we went over to derek's to see him and jet.. we chilled a while and thats about it! so sunday.. hm.. this is gonna be a lil out of order.. so yall can decide what goes where!!! we went and saw the desoto boys before one of their games! well turns out their coach had said no visitors..but they didn't mention that to us.. so when he came in to give them their lil pep talk or whatever.. we had to hide in the freakin bathtub with the lights off!! we're standing there all silent and stuff.. trying our hardest not to bust out laughing!! it was so funny! we went and watched their last game at 12 .. they lost 4-1.. oh well! =( we talked to them a while afterwards (*wesley*, paul, and brice), listened to a cd of paul's band and the "theme song" of the weekend (sLoW JaMs!!)
