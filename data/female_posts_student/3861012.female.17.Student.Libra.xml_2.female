I was set on this being what I wanted to do and what I wanted to aim for the HSC. Mum came home last night and confused me again. She had been talking to some Med 3 students and they suggested that I don't do the med science degree if I wanted to do medicine and that I should instead do Pharmacy, chiropractor, or physiotherapy. They said that that way I could support myself with a career when I do the four year medicine course. Now I'm confused.  the other option that was suggested to me was to do Medicine straight away at University of Newcastle who still offers it as an undergraduate course. This would be good because personally the prospect of spending 7 years in uni isn't really appealing but I don't think that I could move away from home to go to uni.   This is so annoying just when I thought I knew what I wanted to do.
