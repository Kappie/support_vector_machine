((July 17-July 21)) and it was just an amazing expierence we did so much in just a week..it touched each and everyone of our lives  in some way or another!! i really learned about the Power of Prayer..by just some of the stories that people told me during Mission Trip, and by my own expierence..i mean God will answer your prayers..and on that...         "More tears are shed over answered prayers than over unanswered prayers."                                           -Mother Teresa      just a thought...i found that in one of the books that i do my quite time with...lol! but uh yea Mission Trip..wow!! i have pictures of it if you want to see them, and like oh my goodness words cant describe it! and if you ever get the chance to go on a mission trip..TAKE THE CHANCE..its a life changing expierence! i loved it! and so many tears were shed in NYC that week just my my youth group and the sponsers..well im out of words to say..but only my heart can explain it...and just ask anyone that went on the mission trip..it was tottaly INCREDIBLE..lol      -Lindsay
