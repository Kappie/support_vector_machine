Will- Sorry about my mom...that was amusing after the fact but she's just pissed now about anytime that I'm not studying for my SAT II's. If you need/want to talk to me then e-mail works really well. The pool party is definately going to have to wait since Zabeth went to Mississippi today, I'm leaving, and, well, Linds is busy. Josh is free though; so is Becky.  I know I'm a worry-bug but can the two of you do something for me in the next month, especially Will. Josh, I know you'll be kind of busy, at least mentally, with Linds and that's great, honestly. Becky is going through a really low period...yes I know euphenism (sp?)but she's told everyone that no one can help, esp Phil and I but I also know she adores her friends. Can you by any chance just keep her busy so she doesn't have that much time to dwell on the problems and spend time with the truly good part of her life, her friends? She loves movie nights and just hanging out. Go the Recreation World, go swimming, go ice skating (she does love that and she's good) just keep reminding her that her friends love her. I would if I was here but I also think that I wouldn't be able to do much even if I was. I love her to death and would give up Phil for her but in her mind the choice has been made and that choice distances Becky from me, at least alittle, for awhile. Also she loves running so if any of you feel up to the challenge go for it. I think she's doing a Red Cross Marathon so.. train with her or something. I love you two!!! Thanks!!! I know exclamation mark crazy but I don't know if I really put how strongly I feel about this in this little post (yes, LITTLE). I never thought I would stab a friend like I have, in fact I never thought I would have to face anything like it. You two have seen the brainstorming of if I do like him and if not and if I would ever act on it. You've heard me mull over how Becca has felt over the months and you have seen me deal with it. I also know that you two love me and have put up with alot because of me. Thank You. I know that isn't much but honestly thank you. I don't know what's going to happen as much as I wish I could say but I do know this, friends are the world. If it wasn't for you this past year, acedemics and all, would have been more insane than it was. Thanks for the little waves in the halls between English. Thanks for the walks from physics. Thanks for the "NOTHING!!" screams down the hall. Thanks for your know-it-all attitudes...both of you. Just plain...I'm gald your here. Take care of a friend for me. I know Josh by now is rolling his eyes and going "Rosie, you know I would without you asking" but I have to. I have to know that she'll be ok; not only that but happy. I want it so badly right now. Take care of her for me, for everyone. She's such an angel. No matter how much she says she's stubborn, strong, ok, fine, and going to be fine, she truly is more fragile than all that. Thanks. Forgive the mistypes and the bad grammar (spelling, punctuation, ect.) as usual. Oh yea...and don't forget to smile, sleep, and laugh.  Byebye
