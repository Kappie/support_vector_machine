(Out of the corner of my eye i can see bandit flying through the air in both directions.) "The box of rocks sitting in my truck for this apartment," he says. (Well I suppose at this point I should have been glad that he didnt just walk into the apt like the flower delivery guy). "Um, I think you must have the wrong address. What kind of rocks are they?" Now here was where the "sleepy me" turned into the "psycho archaeology me" and actually thought they might have been important rocks sent from maybe France for me to look at! Not a chance. "They're just a bunch of plain old rocks,"says the lil man with the pony tail. "Lemme get my paperwork and I'll be right back." Sure enough those rocks were for my apt. Turns out the delivery man was supposed to drop them off to a bunch of mexican workers outside my apt. For what? I dunno. Maybe they are going to make my apt bigger. Or maybe they're gonna pave the newly cemented sidewalk with them. To be honest I dont care. They're not my type of rocks anyhoos. http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2004-8/803660/boxrocks.gif
