I honestly am. I hope they have a wonderful life. And to think, when Tony logged on, I  HATED  him, lol. Now we're buddies! Its weird to explain. He is the best friend that I have always wanted, and so is Christy. I am very happy to have them in my life. Tony is just the BEST guy friend, and Christy is the best girl friend. They are both older then me, but oh well. I love them to death. grrrrrr, i need to write, I'm bored, but I have nothing to write about, I could write about Shawn, bt I don't want to mess up the website :P Hm........ What to talk about...... Ok, tomorrow, I'm seeing this band: April Wine, they have been family friends for YEARS, and I was kinda named after them. See, mom named my brother after Brian and Myles: Bryan, and the female version of Bryan is Breena.. my name, lol. ANd they are the nicest ppl. They always make sure we have seats when they come here, and one of them ususally gives me guitar pics and stuff like that. Jerry is my fav. He's the drummer. I wish he was my dad. I really do, oh there's something to write about, by scumbag father, but he is a waste of energy to type, so no. lol I woulden't mind writing poems here too. I think I'll give that try.  God must really want me to happy to have put you here For you always make me smile Yet you always make me cry You showed me that life was worth living But made me want to die. Only a matter of time before my heart expodes One hug from you would ease all of that You're hundreds of miles away Your heart is even farther away You have shown me love You have shown me pain But God still must love me for making you  Thats all for now.  ~~Breena
