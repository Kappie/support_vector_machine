No bikes or scooters or skateboards anywhere in the parking lot or sidewalks. We have a playground.  Today, Nikko was again playing ball in the parking lot. We heard him say to the other kids "Wanna play scooter soccer?" and proceeded to kick balls toward our home. As the ball skidded up to our walkway, my mom stepped out and said "Nikko, am I about to get a free ball?" with an arch of her eyebrow. He nodded 'no' and scootered away.  A moment later he was at it again, so she stepped out and said "Are you doing it again?" and he shook his head 'no' obstinately and started to rush away. "Excuse me, you don't just ignore me when I've asked you to stop playing ball," said my mom as she walked after him. He called over his shoulder that his mom wanted to talk to her, so she said "Fine, let's go right now," and went after him.  I stood with Gavin for a few minutes until I heard yelling. We walked over and found both Nikko's parents glowering and yelling at my mom, who was standing with her hands on her hips looking angry.  It got worse. They yelled about how she can't tell them how to raise their kids, they know where their kids are every minute of the day, and they reprimand Nikko when they need to because he's not perfect. "Oh," my mother countered, "so you know when they're behind my house and standing on my porch and you're ok with it?" The mom sputtered and said she'd tell them to stay away then, if she didn't like it. After the dad barked at my mom from behind the screen door, my mom asked him to come out because it was rude. At one point the mom started to tell her to shut up, but caught herself mid-word. The other neighbor joined in, yelling about how everyone tells him his kids are damaging their cars and "show me the damage, show me the damage". They insisted that unless there was actual damage, we should tolerate the kids throwing balls, and that social ettiquette decreed it unsuitable for people to complain before damage was done. Call the police then, file a lawsuit, they said (all so their kids don't get told not to bounce balls at our cars and houses? Does it really have to come to that first?). My mother told the third party that he was actually doing a good job managing his kids, that the noise was actually decreasing from them and that their kids don't bounce balls, and so he limped away (his foot is injured) looking unhappy. "Where's the aloha spirit?" he wailed as he left. (I'll tell you where, I had it jammed up my ass every day of high school. As far as I can tell, he was exhibiting "aloha spirit" very well by coming out to yell at us.)  So, after being accused of hating kids, trying to control their play so we could maintain our "boring" life, and being told that "supervision" does not mean maintaining visual contact with your kids and making sure they're behaving (that is the definition, isn't it?) we left feeling pretty pissed off. At least by the end of it, they had calmed down enough to tell us to just come to them when we have a problem (so their kids don't have to be respectful of adults and can do whatever they want otherwise?) and we said we would. Meanwhile, Nikko was in the background telling a neighbor that he was just playing ball and that lady came out screaming at him. I told him in no uncertain terms that she absolutely was  not  screaming when she came out and asked him to stop.  We have a copy of the rules. If it comes up again (which it will) we can simply read them aloud. It even states that it is the homeowner's responsibily to enforce the rules on their own before taking official action, so we are  not  unreasonable to ask them to stop behavior that is clearly against the rules. In the meantime, we'll call the manager tomorrow to report this. And if it's a lawsuit they want, I'll start taking pictures every time their kids are out there with balls and scooters. Great.   I hate drama. I just want peace and relative quiet. Laughing kids are nice to hear. Sceaming helions on wheels weilding balls is another thing entirely. It really makes me want to move to the country. (When we said that it was reasonably quiet before they moved in and that the noise went up dramatically when they moved in, they cried "GOOD!" because, of course, we are child-hating nazis who just want a boring life. Bah. Hello, we have a kid. And unlike them, we will teach him how to fit into society and think about other people instead of expecting everyone to let him do whatever he wants and be cocky about his right to do it.) But, hey, it's aloha spirit, after all. Kids will be kids, so long as you know their general location, you don't have to care about how they're behaving or actually show them how to play nicely. ("Oh, what's YOUR definition of playing nicely?" they snapped. Hello? Hopscotch, jumprope, pretend, tag, leapfrog, ANY play that doesn't involve screaming and throwing balls at cars, maybe? Sheesh.)  Okay, I feel better now. What a tirade, eh? We ended up at the bookstore at the mall to fume quietly, because the swimming pool was closed for some reason. My mom, seasoned by years of parent-teacher conferences, calmed down quickly, but I only get angrier as time goes by, and I didn't even participate in the event, only witnessed it. I guess that's how it goes with me. I'm angrier than ever about the events in New York this past winter. I'll be damned if I ever set foot there again. It will take a funeral, nothing less (including weddings). >8[
