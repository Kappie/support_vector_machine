Thankyou that you help us and guide us and give us all that we need and keep on showing us the way to live better lives for You so that we may be cleansed and ready for what You have for us in Heaven. "Who shall I compare to You, who can reach so deep into my soul, like You my Lord." Lord You know us inside and out and You know what's best for us beacuse You created us. Thankyou for this and that You are in control.   You are eternal, You will never change and your love will never fade, nor will You leave your people.   Please keep us fresh in You and willing to go wherever your path may take us, however challenging it may be - because You were willing to pay the price for us, even if it meant your Son.  Please help us  not  to live for our  own  glory, but for  yours    Your will be done in Jesus' name, Amen
