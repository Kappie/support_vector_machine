It is true, I have not recorded my notes from today's Civil Procedure class, but they're all nicely kept in the Federal Rules supplement section called RULE 12.  No, our professor could not just assign us it to read, he had to tell us in class what each section and subsection said.  (Sigh)  The book reports have reached a new level.    Anyway, my note-typing has been a bit lax of late, as I've been distracted by the whether, my fabulous mood in general and yesterday, by this incessant need to run errands.  The two primary points of focus were getting my winter locks trimmed and buying a small, relatively-inexpensive boombox on which to play my bastardly-burned CDs.  And so, rather than staying around, studying and typing after classes, I took off immediately thereafter to seek my fortune with a stylish new do and miniature stereo.  It all went fantastically, I successfully avoided the evil one-stop shopping empire taking advantage of minimum-wage working women across the land, the Spring Mixes providing the more-than-apt theme songs.  In fact, I even managed to investigate the possibility of a new bookshelf/DVD tower and do a bit of grocery shopping AND fill Harley's tank before heading home by 3!  I KNOW!!  Amazing, isn't it?    And it didn't stop there!  Once home, armed with my new toy, I set about enjoying it immediately while catching up on checkbook balancing and general house puttering.  Eventually, all the good times had to come to an end for the sake of doing today's homework, which wasn't even needed as it turns out.  As I was preparing dinner before heading back to school to type up my back log of notes (yes, class, this is foreshadowing), I felt ready to experience the 1st Volume of the Spring Mix on "Random" mode.  I looked for a convenient "Program" button or the like on the handy remote the boombox came equipped with, but was denied.    "How odd to only have the random feature on the player itself." I thought as I made my way over to the little guy on the floor, pushing away the thought you all are having now.  Crouching around the new acquisition, I denied the obvious even further.  "Here, let me turn on the light.  It's got to be on here somewhere."  But it wasn't.  "Maybe I need to do a combination of 'Program' and 'Memory'."  But I didn't.  "Okay!  FINE!  So there's no Random feature.  So what?  I can live with it like it is!"  But I couldn't.    "Hey!  I'm NOT going to Wal-Mart after all that!  Principles are worth more than a damn Random feature!"  But they're not.  I tried convincing myself of that throughout dinner and the first subject's notes, but I knew the truth.  And so, Contracts was forsaken for yet another day and I made may way back across the border to return my briefly-but-intensely-enjoyed-but-ultimately-worthless new boombox in exchange for one from the Den of Satan.  And no, Shopko did not offer any viable choices other than the one I initially walked out with, so don't even start with me!  I loved my new RCA pal immediately, even though I felt kinda dirty about it.  To make sure I would never forget what was forsaken in the path to Random, I named the little guy Sam, after the founder of Wal-Mart.  He is now Sam Tort in further recognition of the trials those brave workers face each and every day so I can have everyday low prices and my Random feature too.
