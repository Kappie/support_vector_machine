And when I saw I didn't get into UofT, she makes this face like as if she's really sorry that I didn't get in but inside, she's really feeling like she's better than me. She's not even a friend. She's a loser.  So I had the accounting test today. I bombed it. I freakin' skipped Geometry to study for accounting (Yeah I know). It's Olga's birthday. ... YAY!!! Anyways, I thought I knew everything and Morgenthau's not even there. So the test had 34 M/C and T/F questions. LIke 4 or 5 freakin' pages of short answers. The test was so freaking long I was afraid I couldn't do them all! I don't care anymore. As long as I get 70, I'm fine. Wow, such a big difference from me last year or two years ago, getting pissed off from an 80 mark.  The physics quiz was today. I studied my ass off in period 4 for the freaking quiz. Liena comes like 20 minutes to class and obviously she didn't study. Then she has the fucking nerve to ask me how to do the quiz. I fucking finished the quiz in like less than 20 minutes and I'm the one waiting around for like 15 helping her. I'm such an idiot. Next time, don't even help her. I'm seeing why Jodie doesn't want to help anybody or give anybody the answers. Karima is stupid too. She gives Natasha and Veena all the answers. She lets those two walk all over her. Me, not so much because I always ask them for favours too. I'm such a pushover. So Liena's gonna get perfect because of me, doesn't even thank me. I'm not gonna get perfect because I made a stupid mistake that I told her and she's gonna get right. It's not fair. She gets a 90 average. How in the fucking world does she get a 90 average. She says she doesn't study, she has her freaking genius brother to ask all the questions. I hate this. I hate her. I hate my life. At least when I get to McMaster, I don't have to see her again. I hope she fails at UofT. She's probably not going to because she has her brother and she's so damn "smart" but you better believe it, I'm gonna wish she fails.   What a lousy day.
