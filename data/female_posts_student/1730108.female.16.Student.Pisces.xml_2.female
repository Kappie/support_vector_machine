At any rate...from my profile u can see that I am a huge fan of the 80s. Probably one of the best eras ever. lol. For those of you who like the movie   The Breakfast Club   I have a little something. At one point during the movie, Bender is running thorugh the hall screaming what me and my friends thought was "I wanna be an airforce ranger." But no...if you watch the movie with captions(you should if your a fan of the movie..lol...you'd be surprised at all the things you've missed)you'll see that this is the whole song   Airborne Ranger   I wanna be an airborne ranger I wanna be an airborne ranger Before the day I die There are five things  I wanna ride Rifle, lifeboat, automobile Virgin's mother and a ferris wheel I wanna be an airborne ranger  I wanna be an airborne ranger  If this a shorter version of a real song could someone tell me the whole song...or if anyone has links to anything fun about The Breakfast Club just post it on comments please. Thanks. :)
