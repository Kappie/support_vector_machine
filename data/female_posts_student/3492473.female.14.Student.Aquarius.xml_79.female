After all the pain they put me through my whole life, what was the point in giving them more and more chances to just let me down? See my sister moved back home last June. Back then, we were never really close as kids or when she lived with my dad or her boyfriend but once we got into the groove of things at home, it was great. Now we're we're best friends, we can trust each other with anything, and it feels good. We both have a whole new set of clothes and make up and everything! We share it all! Everything is up for grabs! Most of you who know me, know that I didn't have the best dad or the best childhood growing up. There was a lot of problems and a hell of a lot of fights. And that my dad wasn't a part of my life for  more than 7 years...  But I'm happy to say my dad is back in my life. He's soo much better than what he was those seven years ago. He's really matured and gotten serious. It's soo nice to see the "new" him. I've seen him twice in the past three weeks. It's really nice to just hang out with him and my other family. Like seriously, I never knew how close everyone was until now. My McGrath side of the family is so close. My uncle and my dad cheer me on for burping! I mean, wow! I was doing things in front of my dad that other people would kill me for. And it was cool because last time we hung out, he asked me to give him some of my poems and this time I did. I gave him three, Time Flies, Death, and Stay, Don't Go. I'm really nervous about what he'll think because that's how I am about my writing but I think he'll like em. And I've realized my family is so supportive! Like my uncle was saying I'm so beautiful and that I'm gonna be a great driver, despite what my older brother says. He even got mad when my brother kicked me out of a convo. It seems like everyone is always there for each other. Like they just walk around and say, "I love ya man" or "I love ya bro!" This is everything I've ever wanted but never gotten. A note to everyone else: Every situation is different, I know that but please, all of you try to stay close with your family and form a really good bond with them. Let me tell you, it sure as hell feels good to just be able to say, "My dad thinks I'm awesome for burping..."  Just always give them another chance to let you down because you never know, they might just surprise you, and bring you up...
