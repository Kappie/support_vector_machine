It was fun! and then we went to Girl Scouts, and i got sat on by a buncha little girls. I almost suffocated! ah well, enough of that. I've still been doing alotta thinking, and I just can't get this outta my mind. I'm afraid that I'm going to die before I leave my mark on the world. You know what I mean? I-....well, I'm just afraid that I'll die and leave so many things undone, leave so many people unsure about how I felt about them. Probly just being paranoid...but still!!!!! I can't help it! I'm scared that when I die, people will remember me as the b*tch that only thought of herself. again, just me being silly. I know that people care about me. I guess I just need reminding sometimes. Blog at ya laterz. Love, Shannon What if you never let them know how much they meant to you?
