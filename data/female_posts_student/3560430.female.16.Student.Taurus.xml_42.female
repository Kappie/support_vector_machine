I always forget about how great working out is until about an hour or so after a really intense workout on a hot hot day when my limbs go to jelly and my mind to mush and I think "Wow that was a little bit fun." I forget that I'm good at something until I do it. The only thing I ever give myself aclaim for is my writing and even then I'm doubtful. Well I'm watching city slickers right now (gotta love Billy Crystal!) and that means mom want sme there. As well daddy had to kill some of the big bad viruses.       Wow my limbs are going to be mush tomorrow. Thank heavens I had a looooong bath tonight. Yay!
