Me nothing here in school i finally got a chance to keep you updated since my computer is all trippin and stuff. so how far has my summer  been? well its been ok aslong as i can still see my friends im cool. Last saturday we had a final game against milby and we tied one to one but since they were in a higer position than us we lost. But dont worry they'll be full of surprises next year and i must admit that i feel like all the work that we did was for nothing but it was for somethin to prepare us for whats coming up next.    I'm going to be a junior next year and that is very hard to believe cuz if i remember not too long ago i was in the 3rd grade and jus the other day i was a seventh grader and a couple of days ago i was barely a freshman and now imma be a junior man time does slip by really fast. But imma keep myself concentrated this year in school i cant be fooling around cuz even though i want to stay in high school as long as i can i want to be ready for college.    uummm.... i got these new pink panties and their really cool... oh yeah my cat is on a diet because the doctor said she was too fat. can u believe that?? im crampin really bad right now and i have to go to the restroom but im too lazy to get up. yesterday was fathers day and i gave my daddy alot of kisses and hugs. well since i have nothin to say anymore i guess ill close this up but i will try to fill you in more later.... byeee  p.s this is my friend Bryan who got hit by mr.salcedo's car!!!    *Before*   *After*
