Congrats! Your new quote is  Idem velle atque idem nolle, ea demum firma amicitia est. You get extra  points, anywhere from 10-100 if you tell me if you agree with the quote  or not. So you can get up to 260 points this time around.    WE HAVE A PHONE NOW!!!!!!!!!!! Do you know how happy that makes me?? I  was going crazy without it! But now, yay! I can get calls! Although, I  did go 15 days without it.    Last night went to see Sussical. That is such a cute show. I really enjoyed myself. :-)    And I must add a YAY in because Sarah's page is up and running once more. I really like the new layout. It's very nice.    Oh, yeah, before I forget, points!     Nathan ...................990     Ali ..........................900     Sarah......................720     Michael...................520     Marten....................470     Olivia......................460     Jonah......................320     Evan.......................160    SO.....yeah. The kids got back this morning from Canada. Chelly and  Chris came and woke me up at 7h00. Ugh. I though, did not get up, and  went back to sleep until 10h30. :-D    I found out something very cool. I ran out of silver polish yesterday,  and I needed to shine up one of my flutes. (One that I am going to  sell.) Anyways, mom told me to use toothpaste, and you know what? It  worked! So if You ever need to shine something silver and have no  silver polish just go to your bathroom and get your Colgate. It works  just as well. (Although it's harder to do if your on the phone with  someone as Sarah and I found out this morning, lol. Ah well. Yeah,  there's my useless advice for today: Buy toothpaste for all your silver  polishing needs. :-)       "Shall we go to bed?"
