Thats not to say that anything is pissing me off, but its hard to smile sometimes when you're like this.  Mix that with the fact that I haven't had a cigarette since Sunday and you have a particularly  urlLink  irritable Diva.     I'm really getting annoyed with the "News Media", the bastards are completely and utterly irresponsible.  First of all they're all trying to jump the gun and get the "breaking news" on a story and they start reporting non-stop on something they have only barebones facts about and half truths.  Then they have to come out and tell the REAL story a few days later 'casue they were all trigger happy and got it all fucked up.  Heres an idea: why don't you do yourself the favor and wait til you get a few SOLID facts before you go blowing things entirely out of proportion and getting everyone in a tizzy.  Secondly:  why don't you stop giving out these exclusive, behind-the-scenes security details about airports, powerplants and military operations.  Why don't you just throw a feed into Osama Bin Laden's fucking cave and tell him exactly what we're planning and where our weaknesses are and then maybe see if he could pencil in a good time to attack us again, you fucking idiots!    I appreciate that we live in a free society and with all the new technology we have its easy for us to explain things, and  I know people are naturally nosy bastids, but I'm sorry, I dont think that we as a society need to know all the intimate details of our national security or lack there-of.  I would rather have you retards keep your fuckin' mouths shut so that we could stop giving the terrorists new ideas on how to attack us.  Do the words "Loose Lips Sink Ships" mean nothing to anyone anymore.  If you're willing to sacrifice security to be "in the know" about stuff, why dont you join the fuckin' service so you can be in the know and do something positive about it instead of just using it as useless watercooler fodder.       I have  urlLink school  again tonight and once again I'm actually looking forward to it.  Probably just cause its the begining of the school year where I think I can acutally make it through a semester without dropping out.  Maybe I'm just motivated 'cause I finally want to get this over with so I can take care of more important things.    On a happier note: all is well with me and Ma Dukes again so I'm happy about that, and although I'm missing  urlLink someone , I know the weekend is coming so we'll be able to rock out real soon.  Oh yeah and its payday this weekend, so thats SUPER sweet and I'm finally growing a set and starting to stick up for myself with someone very bad.  A battle is looming, and although its gonna be bloody and ruin a friendship and hurt feelings it has to be taken on before it gets worse.  Oh yeah, and if she tries anything I can break her arm six ways now, goddamn, I'm good.  :p  Well thats it for now, catch you kiddies on the flipside.  Mwah!
