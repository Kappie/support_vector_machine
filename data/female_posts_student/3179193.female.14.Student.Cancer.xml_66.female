Awww, I really wanted him to come shopping with me since I really wanted a guy's perspective on the stuff I try on. *sniff sniffzZ* Oh well... Whatever. *sighzZ*   Kent went offline 'cos he had to go to school now. Checked out Jay's public blog today. Haha! Summer school... well it isn't that bad from the way he described it.   IngiEE reckons Chrissy has changed. Hmm, good point. He used to be a lot more fun to talk to... I don't know what happened. Oh well, he's growing up... give him space. :)  So bored... can't nap 'cos of my wet hair... so hungry. I hope we have something yummy for dinner~! >O
