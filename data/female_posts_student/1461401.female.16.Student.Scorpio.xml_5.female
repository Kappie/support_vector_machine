Acually I'm trying to make the problem go away, so maybe that's why I'm feeling better. Will it ever be fixed? Doubt it. Oh well, it happens. Ben just got on. I miss him. He's fun to talk to. I LOVE ELLIOTT SMITH! IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS YOU'RE NUTS AND YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT! He's a singer, and he's really incredible. He's like a mix of radiohead, the beatles, and coldplay. A very good mix. He had a song in The Royal Taunenbaums. I don't think I spelled that right, but I could care less. Guys at our school piss me off, but that's not going to change anytime soon, so oh well. I think I've rambled on long enough for now, so I'll just be leaving... yup... here I go... just watch me... Bye Me
