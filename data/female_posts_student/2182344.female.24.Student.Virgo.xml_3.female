I'll just sit here, listening to George Noory on Coast To Coast, writing my rambling thoughts.     I got up at 9 today.  I didn't get to bed until around 2 am last night, but I guess that getting up at 9 am isn't too early.  I had to get up to get the house prepared for my meeting with the pet sitter.  I looked at her website (a few times), and she had pics posted of other pets that she's watched, and one of herself with what I assume must be her dog, in front of her house.  All of the pics show very nice houses, including the pic with her own dog.  So, I am sure that when she drove up to our house, with the dead bushes lining the front yard, and the neighbors house with the gravel parking lot, she must have wondered what kind of house she was about to walk into.  I know that I shouldn't make excuses for where I live.  I'm only 24, and still in college, married, and own a house.  That's pretty good.  Our house isn't all that bad either.  It's not the most attractive from the outside, but that's because vines took over our bushes, and then mysteriously died - after killing our bushes.  I attempted to remove the vines last year, but they were so attached to the bushes, that it seemed almost impossible.  I also found some poison ivy vines in there, so I probably gave up a little sooner than I would have otherwise.  We would have to get a bulldozer out here to dig the dead bushes up - roots and all.  Then we'd have to spend alot of money replacing them.  Being that my neighbors yards and houses aren't extremely attractive, I wasn't too concerned with the appearance of our bushes.  On regular days, that's how I feel - who cares.  But, on the days that someone is coming over, that isn't family or regular friends, I do care.  Anyways, I wanted the front porch and the inside of the house to reassure this woman that our house is presentable, clean, and interesting.  We're not rednecks, we're not lazy, and we don't have velvet Elvis or Jesus pictures hanging on the walls.  Robert thinks that it's ridiculous, and he's right.  It doesn't change the way that I feel though.  I know that people judge you based on how you look, how your house looks...and this woman isn't going to be my friend, she's going to be my pet sitter.  A friend shouldn't judge you, and you shouldn't worry about what they think - at least as far as appearances go.  But, this lady will be in my house when I'm not here, taking care of my pets, and I want her to like me and like my house.  So, anyways, that's my explanation, however ridiculous it is. So, I swept our porch, hung a curtain, swept our floors, straightened the table and kitchen, and cleaned off the back porch.  I made some lemonade to offer her, and then I forgot to actually offer it to her.  I should have offered her something to drink, it was rude of me not to.  Oh well.   I don't have alot in planner for this week.  I had the appt. today, I straightened our bedroom, and did some laundry, went to the grocery store and bought about 33 dollars worth of food (which is really, really low compared to what I usually spend), came home and took a two hour nap, got up and made dinner, ate, watched "Bridget Jones Diary" and went to Speedway and bought some sugary, fattening snacks, and now, here I sit typing this boring blog.  I have alot to do to prepare for this trip that's coming up in less than two weeks, but most of the stuff needs to be done the week of the trip.  Doing them now, would only mean that I'd have to do them again next week.  I hope that everyone enjoys the trip.  I've printed out info on what we can do, where we can go...but I'm making no "plans".  My dad hates plans (the exact opposite of me).  So, we'll just wing it.  Hopefully (and what will probably end up happening is...) we'll just spend the time at the cabin, or in the smokies - not doing the touristy stuff - museums, shopping...There's a park near our cabin called Cade's Cove, and I'd like to go there.  It has cabins, horseback riding....and it's near our cabin.  So, that's the only thing that I want to make sure we do.  The rest of the time can be spent at the cabin, just hanging out.  Dad deserves some rest time anyways.  They're bringing Buddy (Bear's brother) because he's too aggressive to have someone else watch him at the house.  Robert's very against this.  I hope that he doesn't voice his annoyance of the dog coming too loudly or too much.  It will just make my parents feel uncomfortable and angry.  If I say this to Robert, though, he'll get angry with me.  I wish more than anything that he enjoyed animals.  He see them as nothing but annoyances.  He's often too mean to them, impatient with them...He doesn't understand that they're just small, helpless little creatures, totally dependent on us, and giving unconditional love.  We supposedly have this "deal" stating that when all of the animals that we currently own pass away, we will go through the same ammount of time that we have had pets, without pets.  I claim to acknowledge this "deal", but I don't think that I could live without animals.  I have NEVER lived without animals.  I will at least have to have one or two.  Not as many as we have now, but a couple.  He doesn't understand, and nothing that I say seems to have been successful in making him understand.    My new class begins on Thursday.  I'm not looking forward to it.  It's college algebra, and I HATE algebra!!!  I took intermediate algebra last semester - worked my butt off in that class - and still couldn't get above a B.  I'm taking it with the same professor as I had in that class.  He taught it really well, and he was very patient in answering our questions.  There's another woman who was in my class last semester who is also taking it this summer.  I'm glad that I'll have someone to talk to.    I have a dermatologist appt. next Monday.  Yet another Drs. visit to look forward to.  I need to get some moles checked out.  Sounds so attractive doesn't it?  then in September I have the worst Drs. visits of all possible Drs. visits.  That's right - the female-only kind of Dr. visit.  Not looking forward to that AT ALL.  I tend to want to cancel these things last minute.  I've considered cancelling my appt. tomorrow so many times.  I have to go through with it though.  I'm sure that I'll feel sick to my stomach tomorrow.    Ugh!!
