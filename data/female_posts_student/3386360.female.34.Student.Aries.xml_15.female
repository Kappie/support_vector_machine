I will be able to move in. The 100 would get me enough to move in and get some food. I'm so excited. I know it would be easier if I didnt move in until the 1st money wise but I have to do something. :) Ok   yesterday I didnt get to blog at all due to time. I was finally online to do some research and each time I started to blog someone needed me or Luci (the ferret) disconnected the computer. After the second time she ran off and pouted. It was so adoreable. So I will try to catch up. Travis has contenued to break the restraining order. I'm not thrilled. Though I'm not thrilled with anything down in that area. I cant wait to move so that Travis cant follow and it will ease up on the stress.   I am very concerned about Tony going back to see his dad. His dad is not in one place and doesnt have a study place to live or home phone number. He is "staying' with friends until he gets into a new place. I guess the lady he married her kids are with their grandfolks. I'm glad they wont be around but I am worried of the stress that this is going to put on Tony. I dont like the fact he isnt in a stable place. James is very reluctant to give any information at all. Even his own cell phone number. But I know that in order for Tony to go back there that he will have to provide us with an address and all that. The thing is even if he tries to keep Tony the order is only good for certain times that Tony is allowed away from me. Lol Legally so I have that on my side.   Still nothing from A.C. and I'm growing more and more concerned. I will be sending you a letter my heart as soon as I am done with this giving you my new address and praying that you hurry home. I miss your e mails so much. I still am attempting to be faithful to tbe blog so that you know what is going on in my life. I just am not as mushy on here as I would be in private letters mainly because everyone can read this Lol.   Happy Kitty
