So I wonder how many retards forgot to throw salt over their shoulder because it spilled when the cap came off onto their eggs, which only happened because they broke their hand mirror trying to scare off a black cat, then walked outside and onto a crack, heard their mother scream in agony, which startled them, sending them crashing into the neighbors bed of thistles, then stood up and steadied themselves using the neighbors wooden fence and said "damn, the only thing I've got left is to walk under a ladder" without knocking on the wooden fence, then ran screaming from the thistle bed being chased by the homicidal old neighbor, only to run down the street, up a driveway, and underneath a ladder being used by the neighbors, who were busy painting their house hot pink ((it is a personal belief of mine that hot pink houses are bad luck, as we have four here in Shreveport)), and last but not least, they tried to slow down enough so as not to run into the neighbors house, but failed and smashed their lips into the freshly painted hot pink house, making their girlfriend think they had been cheating on her with someone who had bad taste in lipstick, which is why they won't be having a very good valentines day.  so.. Should I launch into my valentine's ((god I hate this holiday-what about the people without boyfriends-I'm going to die alone!)) day rant? Sure I should! Before I cared about having a boyfriend and being in love and yawed yahta, I loved valentines day, I sent candy to my friends, I wore red((but I always do that)), and I got a miniature whitman's sampler from my mom. But these days, it just kind of gets me down. I don't bother sending candy to my friends, girls as it may be construed as a lesbionic, and guys as it may be construed that I would like to sleep with them. I sit around, being bitter and eating chocolate that I bought for myself. But this year, I refuse. I'm going to be peppy, I'm going to babysat(($)), and I'm STILL going to eat lewd amounts of chocolate((but chocolate makes me happy so it's ok)).  next weekend is the Krewe of Gemini parade. I LOVE MARDI GRAS! It's so festive and royal and loud and drunk and sparkly and wonderful! One of the best nights of my life was when I was attendant to the duke of Arkansas and I got to ride on his float. It was special, because it wasn't the children's float that all the dumb kids had to ride on and throw crappy beads, and it was great. Unfortunately, I was so pumped with adrenaline and orange soda I don't remember much from that night, except that we went and ate at copelands afterwards and I spent the night with the duke and his wife, and we got home really really late because we went to the bridge closing ((where everyone goes on the big bridge at midnight and says goodbye to Mardi gras and they turn all the lights on and then you walk around and admire the costumes/floats and then kiss kiss go home))((it's the official end of the mardi gras season, if you didn't catch that)).   so next weekend I'm going to the parade with Sarah, Bess, and hopefully Emily. I know it will be a blast. Plus mom managed to get us a hotel room, so no worries about mamma.  oh by the way...     Happy   Birthday   Emily!     her actual birthday was Wednesday, and I crocheted her a scarf. It was red and had scalloped edges and fringe. She liked it a lot and I was glad because Emily deserves it.   lately Devon and I have had a big pacman thing going on((everyone over the age of thirty((20?)) can lose the images of darkened rooms and little yellow balls. This is baseman world 2, meaning he kills stuff and flies, no more chasing fruit around for him.)) so anyway, dev and I have been playing it like crazy, and we're about 3/4 of the way done.  my grandmother has taken to smoking in the house while my mom is out and it's choking me to death. Mom has been at the doctor all day, helping out her friend mike, who is my "uncle mike" because he was my grandpa's best friend before he died. Uncle mikes got all kinds of bladder diseases, so he's been having trouble. But mom and I make him soup and visit him sometimes, and he seems to be doing better.  daddy sent us valentine's day cards. That was nice of him. I really need to hop onto regards.com and send everyone an e-card.  hopefully this obese post ((with the bonus Friday the thirteenth spew)) ((har-dee-har)) will make up for my scarcity the last week or so. I plan to take up blogging daily again full speed ahead.
