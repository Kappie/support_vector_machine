So, i', going to try and put it into words. On Saturday, Kyle cancelled on me and i was rather angry, and sad. We had planned to go out to dinner, and then he had to leave. Instead i went to movie, and as good as it was, i felt sick and wasn't able to really pay attention. It was nice spending time with Damon, but i can't help feeling that theres tension there, and things left unsaid. On sunday, i spent hours doing my hair and getting ready, and then we went to dinner, i had a lot of fun, our waitress was so sweet, and i liked talked to her, then we decided to rent a movie, instead of go to one. We watched Saving Silverman, and it was pretty good. On Monday, i woke up, and get ready and watched tv, and ate a pogo, and went to work, and worked till 5, and then i went home and changed, and then i went to The Village, and it wasn't what i expected, but it was really good. Then i came home and laid around till i was put to bed. Today, well today, i hope to get around to cutting a friends hair, and then im going to the mall to check out the new stitches and buy a b-day present for a friend. :D it'll be a good day i think. michelle
