I got pissed because I don't see how it's any of his business.  Maybe he's just jealous.  I don't know.  He called me a sell-out because I told Nathan where his clogs were. (Al hid them)  I say, as far as I can tell, you're the sell out.  He knew what I meant, but for some reason he wanted to delve into it deeper.  Yeah right.  I wasn't about to get into an argument over that shit.   Spencer and I were talking about him on the way to Opry Mills tonight.  I briefly told him the story of why Big Al is such a sell out.  Nobody can believe that he'd betray me like that.  But he did.  That's the cold hard truth of it.  I want to talk to him so much sometimes, it just feels like our conversations are limited.  Spencer and I are getting closer.  Emi got mad because I really wanted to go with him to the movies.  She swears up and down that he likes me.  Everyone is messing with us about this shit.  I don't believe it's true.  Right now, I'm not laying anything out on the line.  Fuck it.  I've had a really bad past month concerning guys, and right now I don't have any time to invest.  I dont' know who I like right now either.  I really do like to flirt, I just wish things would go farther with one person in particular...  So, I got paid today and I went shopping.  I got three pairs of pants, a collared shirt, and a pair of Kangaroos for 125 dollars.  Woo!!  I'm a bargain hunter, what can I say?  I'm excited and can't wait to wear my Kangaroos.   I am not writing in this enough. I'm having trouble finding time.  I need to write more, so people can stay updated.  Oh!  Jason came by to see me at work.  Interesting.  I really wasn't prepared for that and everything was going shitty already.  I had a hard time from just breaking down in front of him and letting him have it.  Bah.  But this is all for now.  Work in the morning.   By the way, Spencer and I saw Anchorman.  Very good.  Hillarious.  You'll laugh until you cry.  =)  Peace out.
