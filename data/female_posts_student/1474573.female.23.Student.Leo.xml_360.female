Well I'm not talking a certs or an altoid, people!  I'm talking about those red and white peppermints that you get in stores and stuff.  We have a whole stash over here.  Those things have some air bubbles in them sometimes and so if you're sucking hard enough, the hole can cut you.  The edges are sharp, man!  Hmm... Maybe it's just me.  Is it just me?  Talk to me people!  It's not just me, is it?!
