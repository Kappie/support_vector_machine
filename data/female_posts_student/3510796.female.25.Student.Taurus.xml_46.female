I don't want to sound overly excited about it.  I'm not in high school anymore, but for some reason, this makes me all happy and I have that warm, fuzzy feeling.  Hardly.  As it turns out, I will not be attending the Phish show Friday night.  :-(   Its horrible, I know, but things come up and other plans happen and then you're stuck with feelings of guilt.  Phish is a great band, but the need to go just isn't the same as other things that a girl wants, and needs.  I was telling my friend last night about the band that a bunch of us are going to see Friday night, and my psychology teacher heard this conversation.  Guess he likes the band, and it turned out that he wants to go-and meet me there.  So it isn't a 'date', but he knows I am going and said we should meet up at the show.  Besides all that, the band,  urlLink 2Northwest  is awesome and it should prove to be a good night.  Superflys birthday is Saturday, and this will be the night we celebrate.  I just might take my dads' digital and get some pics.  Ohhh, I should do that.  Would be good to snap some shots of drunken superflys and greys.  OK, so my blogging mind is going to sleep and this doesn't feel right.  Till next time....   Peace.Love.DMB.
