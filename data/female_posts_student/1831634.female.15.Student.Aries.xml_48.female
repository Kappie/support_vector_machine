I thought we were meeting at 10!!  so then I got up... dressed... ate... and got there at 10:30 anyways.  then we filmed.  and filmed.  and filmed.  then I went to jack's house and his dad cooked us hamburgers.  whoo.  then he played fishy and I watched him.  and he burned me a copy of his pokemon CD.  sadly enough, that was my one present today.  -___-  then we [jack and me] went to lisa's house.  we picked flowers for like... 45 minutes.  then jack and I played pingpong.  then we watched TOTORO!!  and i was so happy.  totoro is so cute!  I want a totoro of my own.  =(  but it was in japanese with chinese subtitles... so we just kinda watched the pictures.  and we pressed our flowers.  and then jack and lisa played with my hair.  and then we tried to paint jack's nails, but it didn't work.  so we painted his arm instead.  whoo.  and then we left lisa's house!  and I went to math.  where I was freaking dead.   then we went to didy's house and continued filming.  and filming.  and filming.  WE'RE MORE THAN 1/2WAY THROUGH WITH OUR MOVIE...!!  whoohoo!  and then I came home at 10.30.  12.5 hours after I left home.  man.  and tomorrow [today by now] I'm going to jack's house at 9 and filming til 11.30.  then chinese school.  then more filming.  then homework.  man.... I hate the weekend!!  oh, and lisa's coming over tomorrow.  whoohoo.  and I didn't see my parents at all today.  well... I did.  for like 20 minutes in all.  =(  and I didn't get cake!  and I didn't get any sort of celebration at all.  =(
