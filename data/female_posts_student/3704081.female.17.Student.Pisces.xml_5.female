You know, it just bothers me how I sit around and I wait for you and then you never follow through with  anything.  Today isn't the first day this has happened. Sure, we do hang out occasionally and we do have fun together, but those times are like.. once in a blue moon.   I don't get you at all.  You say that we are good friends, but whenever I want to do something, or try and make plans with you, you are always too busy, or too tired, or this is happening or that is happening.   You know what hurts my feelings worse? When you give me an excuse, I know that you're really going places with your other friends.   *But I won't name names because then you would know that this is directed at you, and I don't want that to happen.* I'm just trying to get out some emotions right now.     I just wish and hope that someday I'll mean as much to you as you mean to me.
