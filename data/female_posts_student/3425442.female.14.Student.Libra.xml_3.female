I made my bloggy thingy ^^ yesh! *jumps up and down* hehehe I'll probably change the layout but for now I'll keep it ^^  "It's better to let go of a memory than to hang on to a burden past."   Hello!  Actually, the site you've just stumbled upon is my personal/blog site. It contains a lot of my personal information... but nothing that can help you identify me in the crowd (hehe...). It also contain entries of endless rant about my boring life. If you haven't been scared away yet... you're brave. If you are searching desperately for a way to escape from this site, just stay put for a moment and surf around. Who knows, you might find something interesting among all this boringness.  Little bit about this site - this is a personal/blog/collective site, which ever name you'd like to call it. Here you can find a little information about me .  Something to kill time while you're visiting this site. So enjoy! And I'd love to hear any feedback from you.   Bye
