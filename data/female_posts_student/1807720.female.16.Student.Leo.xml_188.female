Everytime I eat, I wake up in the morning and feel really sick and extremely full.  Then I go to the washroom like a thousand times and then I am usually fine.  Except the rest of the day I don't really feel the need to eat.  It's like food is sickening.  I took four bites out of my cereal this morning and felt like my stomach was going to explode.  And I mean that is not like me.  I love food, I love to eat.  This morning it just made me sick, and yesterday I barely ate because I didn't feel hungry even though I went for a 45 minute workout and an hour long walk.  Last night I ate like some M  M's and I felt extremely full for like over two hours and I mean really eating M  M's shouldn't make you feel like you just ate like two steak dinners.  I also started to get the pain in my left side again while I was working out.  I was only into the 5th minute of my workout.  When I was talking to the doctor about that, they just said I over did it.  Ok, so how can I over do it is it's something that is reoccuring all the time.  I mean it happens when I work out, climb stairs, sometimes it just happens when I am sitting.  Usually the mornings are the worst though cause I can seem to keep the food in.  It's like I eat it one day and my body feel the need to just get rid of it ASAP.  I don't really know what this is, and if I go the Doctors again they are just going to give me the bullshit speech of how everything is fine.  I remember when my sister had kidney stones they kept telling her everything was ok, but she was like in extreme pain and like a month later they were like "well maybe it's kidney stones."  Like...hmmmm...you could of thought of that a little earlier.
