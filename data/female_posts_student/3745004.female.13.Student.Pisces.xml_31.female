It has somewhat of a choice fer pets and you can have 3. The pets seem... odd. They seem mostly to be made from parts of other animals in life. Then the map. Most of the places dont work, but hey, it's a growing site!  furry-paws.com is a very odd sitee. It has nothiing but dogs, lots of dogs. Over 100 to pick from. These are realy life dog breeds. Then, after you find where to get them (It's kind hard to) you can change it's pic. The place has jobs you can chose from and games and stuff. Overall it's on odd oky-ish site.  muchopets.com is really odd. The pets are 3D-ish and moving! That's a new one. There are NO games and the site is confusing. It's a slightly OK site, but I wouldnt tell anyone to join it.
