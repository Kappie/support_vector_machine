If you see a girl who's sad Give her a hug If she starts to cry Give her a tissue If she gives you a kiss It'll be ok.  if not. then she won't.    lyrics of the day. "oh god hold me now. oh lord, hold me now. there's no other man who could raise the dead, so do what you can to annoint my hands. oh god where are you now?"
