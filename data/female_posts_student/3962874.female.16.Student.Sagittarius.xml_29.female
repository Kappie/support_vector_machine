I think I need a real job where I actually have to work certain hours because otherwise I don't think I will ever get anything done. Zack said he could probably get me a job at the gym and I think that would be cool. Except for the fact that swim starts in a couple of weeks and school in about a month so it's not like I will have time to work. That's why working for my dad is perfect, I get my own hours. Problem is I'm very lazy, and I always procrastinate. Today, I slept in late, layed around all day, did a little bit of cleaning, helped Daniel wash his car, cooked dinner, and talked to people online. Woohoo. What a great day. At the beginning of the summer I made a plan to workout every morning at about 6 for an hour, then I would work for my dad for 2-5 hours and that would leave me with the rest of the day to do other things. The problem is, I haven't done that once. I am a really organized person and I love organizing things and getting things ready but when it comes to doing things, I am not very motivated, and I hate that about myself! If I would just do things and get them over with, I would be so successful in anything!
