I haven't had the chance to write here since...Dec. 21st...damn.  You'd think I have a life or something...lol.  Christmas kind of sucked for me because I was very sick...in fact I would have preferred to be in bed on X-mas eve than to be receiving presents.  I hadn't been that sick since I was a little girl...and the worst part is that I have asthma so everytime I get sick it seems to get worse.  New Years week was much better for me....my cousin, Silvi made a surprise visit from Colombia.  It was really great to see her again...last time I saw her was when she was 15 and I was 16.  The funny thing is that we did not grow up together yet I feel like she's one of my favorite family members from my dad's side.   We click really good together.  I spent New Year's eve with Silvi, my bro, my cousin Migue, and of course my boyfriend.  It was fun...we just hung out with several other friends, drank, played ping pong *my cousin Migue's X-mas present from his girlfriend*, and listened to music.  Later on in the night, my boyfriend and I went to his house to spend some time with his family.  Ummmmm.....BAD idea!! Everyone was already kind of tipsy...excluding my responsible boyfriend (he's a responsible driver).  So, one thing led to another...and long story short my boyfriend got into an argument with this mother.  Then one of his nosy aunts decided that the reason my boyfriend argued with his mom was because he MUST have been in a bad mood with me....DAMN, why do people always have to go assuming shit ?????   We were having the bestest time until we got there.  Oh well...we still had fun that night.   The next couple of days were spent hanging out w/Silvi before she left on Jan. 4th.    Now I'm almost through with the 1st work week in January...tomorrow is PAYDAY !! Which is absolutely $%ckin' great!! I know I'm not the only broke one after X-mas.    BTW...I just realized that in the last post I didn't even mention what "Sancocho de Gallina" is....so, it's just a Colombian version of Chicken Soup.  It's really great, if anyone wants me to translate just let me know.  COUNTDOWN: 10 more days until my   urlLink 21st Birthday
