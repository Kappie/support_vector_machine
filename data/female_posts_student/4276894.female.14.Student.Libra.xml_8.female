(on a side note, i am very happy that i finally managed to get SnakeNet radio to play on my p.c.! i have to do a lot of weird things involving iTunes but i still got it! YESSS! METAL RADIO! music currently playing: Possessed - Beyond The Gates)     I would like to add a reply to sarah's last post. Altough i love you muchly sarah, I have to say right now i'm not loving so many of you who i thought i did. You know who you are. I am very very annoyed with you because i don't know what exactly i have done (or what you have done, for that matter ^o)) that means you get stressy with me when i try to find out. Hey, i'm not having a particularly great time right now, so do ya reckon you could cut me some damn slack?      Enough rant.   Remember, life is good, life is fine, life is great. Life is utter shite.
