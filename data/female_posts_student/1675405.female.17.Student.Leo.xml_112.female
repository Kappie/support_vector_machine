(*Ahem* and tip money) :-) Well, truthfully, I think my self esteem gets just a tiny boost to and from Colucci's Pizza, because I have since realized since my "initiaton" into the virtuous shop that these girls actually like me. I must not be coming off nearly as high-falutin or arrogant as I must to the others in my life, and it makes me happy. That someone is actually seeing Jennica. I'm just not used to that.  Mom is still iffy about Teaching Academy next year. I want to go, and spend half of my day away from the horrors of Jefferson High. But, mom thinks I am skipping out of what I've worked so hard to get to: my last year of high school, where I don't have any extremely demanding classes. Dilemma...  Back to band tomorrow after a whopping two-day hiatus. Dreading it... Dreading it so much, but what's new? Just one more year... Oh speaking of graduation, I called Grove City College today and made an appointment for a campus tour and an interview on the 18th. I'm really nervous and really frustrated, because it's tuition is the cheapest of any college I deem worth my time, and Mom is really going to give herself an ulcer over the tuition. Hopefully, financial aid will come through for me, because I fear that is the only way that I will be able to fulfill my dreams.  I've got to challenge Allison tomorrow for tennis. No practice, thank the Lord. Mr. Bragga was playing hard-ball with me today and it really made me angry. Normally, I would have no problem throwing the ball right back into his court (figuratively), but I can't really do anything but stick up for myself for fear of losing a top varsity spot I know I would have otherwise. Ah, the woes of forced respect, even through it's not really earned.
