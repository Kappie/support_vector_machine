An irony really, for my life is really filled with nothing more than anger, anguish and fear.    Yes, I fear. I fear greatly.    It's an irony really, as to what the mind thinks, the mind sees, and the mind feels all contradict one another. A pity though, for I would have liked it if I wasn't so wishy-washy about things. Maybe I should have took control of every single situation, making my firm stand about it, but no... I allowed Yulia and Nanashi to take over most of the time, choosing to stay in the dark, hiding, running away, escaping...    Drowning myself in the face of reality in my own thoughts.      I told myself before, that I would never try to kill, though in my blood, the blood of a killer runs deep. I never truly understand though, why I had made myself promise to myself that I will never kill, no matter how much I really wish for the person to be dead. Of all the things that I could remember, the only reason as to why I never wanted to kill was: 'Someone would be sad over the death.'      Pathetic... I don't see anyone being sad about my death.      Ironic isn't it, that I came out with such a reason for not killing, while no one really followed that kind of reasoning on me. What am I really, you ask. A substitute. A comfort zone. A glass component.      I never truly exist in the eyes of human.      The only use that I have, is for humans to make use of me. Yet, even though it bothered me, the rest, being soft-hearted idiots, didn't even care. To them, forgiving is always the case, but to me, hatred runs deep within my veins, swarming me with age-long rememberance of the matter.      I can never forgive. Not now, not forever.
