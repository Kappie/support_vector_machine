I had to have so much blood taken. 6 little tube things. And halfway through when she'd gotten three, something kind of went wrong I guess, maybe there was a block or my vein just didn't feel like giving anymore blood, but something happened and she had to take out the needle and do it in the other arm. Another three viles. Ugh. My arms actually really hurt right now and they're both bruised pretty badly. Eek. No fun. :(   So, tonight I'm supposed to do something with Mary Clare and Kelly but...heaven only knows. I hope I end up doing something though. Only two more free nights of break. AHHH. That's scary. I'm ok with going back to school because I'll get to see people but it also means I'll have to go to classes and such. Blahh. I don't think I'm going to do any homework. I'm just going to go back and hope for the best. Haha. Even if I remembered what my homework was supposed to be, I probably wouldn't do it.
