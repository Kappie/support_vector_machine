Looking at my list of needs (well, not really needs so much as things that would make my life incredibly more convenient), I can tell that I'm pretty much screwed. The littler items I can do without until my birthday on September 13, though it would be preferred that I procure them as soon as is possible, but the larger, more essential things, I really really need. Number one, obviously, is a car. Cars are a very versatile part of any day: they can be used for transportational purposes, as a home, as a bed... I just really need a car. Number two is a cell phone. Now, I know that at times cell phones are extranuous and unnecessary, mostly for 12 year olds, but in my case, it's pretty much crucial. OK, so not crucial, but I'd love to have one. Story time:      Last year I celebrated my 17th birthday. It was a hot hot September day and my little brother Austin (who had turned 5 two days prior) was having his very first soccer game. Of course, I wanted to go and support him and all that good stuff, so I went. I wore jeans because I hadn't shaved and I knew I was going to be under the shade and the game wouldn't last for but and hour. I was a little inconvenienced by the heat, but I wasn't bothered. So,I watched as Austin's team got the crud kicked out of them. The game eventually ended and it was time to leave. Well, my boyfriend at the time,  urlLink Tim , had come to the game and brought my birthday present with him since he was unsure that he would attend the party I was having later. He had left it in the car so we went off to his car to get it. I told my mother "I'll be right back," and we started for the car. I got the present (a pretty pair of pink heart earrings and some ankle socks with little kitties on them, thanks Tim) and we said our goodbyes and I started off to my mother's vehicle. As I was walking away I saw Tim drive off. A0s I walked still further I saw my mother pulling out of her parking space. I assumed that she was just readying herself to leave, but as I continued on my path, she continued on hers and drove away. I watched her drive trying to convince myself that she wasn't leaving, but she didn't turn around. No, sir. I looked around for my grandparents' car because they had come, too, but they were gone as well. They left me. They had all left me. It was my birthday. I had no phone and there were no pay phones. No one was there to lend me their phone. Everyone had left me five miles from home on a hot September day: on my birthday. It was horrible. If I had had a phone I could have just called someone and they could have given me a ride, but I had no phone. So, I walked the five mile trek home in my blue jeans, carrying my box of birthday gifts.   A sad tale indeed. If only I were in possession of a cell phone, my pain would have been prevented. I think that's one of those things I'll cry about every time I think of it and forever be scarred by. That's not the only time I've been left or forgotten, either. There has been many a time when no one came to pick me up from school when I stayed late or from soccer practice when it finished early and all that. Poor me.
