SHARING!:  " no one's life is perfect, but sometimes you can just... fill the empty space with a temporary happiness, but when that happiness is gone, it's like everything falls upon you again, all at once, and no it is not as bad as having ebola, or cancer, or AIDS... or missing a leg... living on the streets... but, however small a persons problems may seem, they still affect that person..."  find your happiness, and hold onto if with all your strength and passion.
