So with gas, I probably saved about 20 bucks.  I was going 87 in a 65, but that was nothing compared to another dude there.  He was going 102 in a 65.  His ticket was only $150.  If I had know it was that cheap, I would've gone faster!         However, there was an interesting character in the hallway outside the courtroom.  He was a black guy, about 60 years old.  He had kind of a slanted hi-top fade.  There was a smidge of grey mixed in to his hair.  He was wearing a white long-sleve shirt with blue pin stripes, and a pair of brown slacks.  He also proceded to inform the entire hallway that he was going to "kick the shit out of" the DA (district attorney for those of you that don't watch "The Practice").  Little did he know the DA was in the hallway at the time.  She remained calm, and asked the "gentleman" whether he had a problem she could solve, and the man replied that, "no he had no problem".  Then she quietly replied in a sweet southern accent, "well if it turns out you do have a problem, come see me and I'll have officer Jenkins here solve it for you."  Officer Jenkins was a rather large man that had an aura of "Not to be fucked with" about him.       The picture is from the Baruch Property where I'm working this summer.  It is a lookout tower, and is one of the only structures that survived Hurricane Hugo. urlLink
