I did quite enjoy it though. I think he found out where my locker is...creepy...Yeah...We got our 40 minute lunches back yesterday! I have been in a better mood because I've actually had a time to do nothing and talk to my friends. It's snowing again. I'de really hoped that it was spring but obviously it isn't. Montana weather is so grand. I have a solo in our peice in band and it so amuses me because it pisses off the third chair flute (who seems to think that she is still better than me even though I am first chair) that she isn't the one with the solo. Finally this blog is felling somewhat like home...mow that I have put in my good paragraph. I ramble too much when there is no one to stop me. Bwa ha ha! Lucky you random people!
