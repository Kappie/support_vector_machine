(it had kinda looked like a mullet and needed to be cleaned up) and then we went to the mall and did some shopping then to barnes and nobles and then finally, home.  But yea...that is what has happend so far..oh yea! i'm getting ready to perform in San Antonio (i'm a singer) and i'm really excited! i think that'll be happening at the end of August..ok.  thats all i have to say.  Have a great day ya'll!
