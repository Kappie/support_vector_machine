It's a good thing. I can help her financially, and I can save some money before I leave for Mississippi. I'm trying to be considerate and make sure that I know the score up front this time around ( "I solemnly swear I will not eat your food, and will use but 1 glass per week" ), because the last time I lived with her, we were both miserable. I think this time will be better, though. Live and learn.  I wish I could have taken the day off for my birthday, but I will settle for cashing in my vacation next month and taking a long weekend at the beach (hey, Lisa- you provide the transportation, I provide the accomodations, huh?). And once I cash in my vacation pay, I can get my freaking car fixed. As it is now, when trying to figure out how long it will take me to get somewhere, I have to tack on an extra five minutes for every ten that it normally takes, cuz that car takes its own sweet time going where the fuck it wants to go.  The reason I could not take off early today is because Crackhead has been out for three days (but is miraculously well enough to come in and get her paycheck after work) and Barbie had to leave early to go out of town- why, I'll never know, since her destination is none other than Columbus, where I will be living come fall, and I know for a fact that it takes less than 2 hours to get there, so why all the drama about having to leave early because she didn't "want to be on the road all day?" Geez.  Plus, I have been training a new girl (I was thinking I would refer to her as Paris, because her face resembles a certain amateur porn queen, but I might change that to Rebel Yell because... well, she's just that country) all week and I finally turned her over to Posh today because I just couldn't handle it anymore, and that left two people- Blondie and myself- on the phone full-time, and one trainee who didn't know shit. Not exactly an auspicious birthday, if you know what I mean.  And more bad news to come. I was really pushing for them to fire Crackhead in deference to Paris/Rebel Yell, but that probably won't happen now because Blondie is going in for surgery in two weeks and will be out for six weeks after that. She probably won't come back until the week I leave (funny). So we can't afford to get rid of Crackhead, because on the rare days that she does show up, at least there's a trained Helper Monkey answering the phones, even half-assed as she tends to do.  Quote of the Day:  Paris/Rebel Yell:  sitting at Cracky's desk  "Gosh, none of her pens work." Me: "That ain't the only thing around here that doesn't work."  (ATTENTION: LOSS OF IMPULSE CONTROL AHEAD)  For the love of all that is good and pure in this world!!!!!!!! Come to work, bitch!!!!!!!!!! I dare you to actually work a full fucking week!!!!!!!! If not for your coworkers, who could use the break, for your crack habit!!!!!!!! That shit ain't free, ya know!!!!!! And no one wants what you're selling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Groooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnn.  And breathe.  I intend to spend the weekend relaxing- trying to forget the idiocy that awaits me Monday morning- and watching all the movies I've missed on InDemand before the cable service is disconnected on Monday. *sigh* There's like ten of them. And no, Lisa, this will not be shades of marathon  Sex and the City . I will pace myself and only watch the most important. Which may well be all of them. Okay, so I'll watch them at breakneck speed back-to-back. Don't judge.  I am so glad to be sitting in this apartment right now. I've left the ghetto, baby!   Movin' on up... to the East Side... to a deluxe apartment... in the sky...   Or a two-bedroom walk-in apartment by the duck pond?  Doesn't have the same ring.   Movin' on up...
