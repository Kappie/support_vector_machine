I decided to stop penny pinching and spend some of that Christmas cash (since I won't be using it to visit little kangaroos and dingos anytime soon).  I joined the digital revolution- or something like it- and invested in an mp3 player.  It's sooooo shiny!!!  Plus it works awesome.  That was a little something-something for myself.  It is fun to play with and I'm sure that once I figure out how to use all of the functions it will be even funner!  I've been keeping busy in NYC for the past few days.  Making sure my Mommy gets her daily hug quota filled.  I wandered around Queens today to check out her new hood.  It's pretty cool- I managed to find a tattoo parlor on my adventure today and decided to get something pierced.    I LOVE MY SPARKLY BOOGER!!!  Needless to say, I went out and got a hole in my nose.  But on the brightside- one can never have too many piercings (at least in my opinion).  The best ones are the ones you have to look for.  *wink wink*  Anywho, trying to stay out of too much trouble before school starts.  Also trying not to spend all my money, but that's inevitable.    More later.  Peace.  ttfn,  *me*
