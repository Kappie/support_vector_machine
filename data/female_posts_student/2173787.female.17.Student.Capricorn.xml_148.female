Then went to lunch with my grandmother, then went back to Kanata to get Kay, took her to garner, picked up dinner for mom dad and myself on the way home, went to the fish store (which i have to go back to tomorrow) and then the mall.  All in all I think I drove 110 miles today and got a cool blazer and a pair of tanks out of it all.  Going off to collapse now...
