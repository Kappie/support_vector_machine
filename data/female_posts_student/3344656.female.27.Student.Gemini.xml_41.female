Other  songs I like are "Half A World Away" "Bad Day" "At My Most Beautiful" "You Are  the Everything" "It's the End of the World..." "Perfect Circle" "Try Not to  Breathe" "Hairshirt" "Fall on Me" and "Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite." That's  not all, but those are all that come to mind at this second... "I am not  the type of dog to leave you hanging for no good reason..."              That's from  "Hairshirt." Other hairshirty referencing songs I like are "What a Good  Boy" by Barenaked Ladies... and that's the only other hairshirt song I can think  of. Song lines I like by BNL are "If you question what I would do to get  over and be with you, lift you up over everything to light up my room."  Even though that's a dependent clause and no condition follows it. The  first time my old roommate Mina heard that song, (it references radio stations  that conduct through their teeth, being able to light a bulb by holding it in  their hands, etc... sounds WEIRD but it's a really pretty song), she said "What  is going on? Are these people made of metal?" and was terribly  confused. I really like "When I Fall" by BNL too. I'm not going to  do this mental drivel online anymore.              I should start  workin'.
