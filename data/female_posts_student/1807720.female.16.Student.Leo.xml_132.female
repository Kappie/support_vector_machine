We watch the Lion King 1 1/2 which is hilarious and My boss Daughter or some movie like that.  Then we played Uno extreme and bunch of card games.  It was fun!  Yesterday I didn't really do much - just listen to a bunch of music and relax.  This break seems to be actually really short it seems like it's going so fast.  I went with my parents a couple places because my dad is in town.  Then we went out for dinner and Swiss Chalet because my mom wanted there chicken.  I felt really lonely on Valentines day though.  I just wished that I had someone in my life.  I just wished for one day that someone could love me, and they could just say "I love you Vanessa" and hold me.  I suppose one day there will be someone in my life, but I am afraid that I might not meet that person.    You know I have been thinking about Aaron a lot.  I mean some sort of twist of fate brought us together over the summer.  Then we just never talked after a few weeks.  Some stupid reasons kept us apart during a summer we could have spent time together.  I mean I know he lied to me about his age and everything when he met me, but I think he only did that because he didn't want me to turn away from him and I didn't.  I miss him a lot.  There have never been anyone like him.  When we met each other both him and myself felt like we were meant to be together for the rest of our lives.  That is not a common feeling when your young.  There was a spark with me and him, there was Chemistry between the two of us.  I don't feel that way with anyone or about anyone else.  I have never felt that way about or with anyone else.  Sometimes I wonder if I will ever see him again.  God can only do so much to create your destiny and let fate do the rest, but I guess sometimes that might not be good enough.  Ultimately we are the ones that decide what direction our lives go in.  Some of us take the right directions, some of us take the wrong directions.  Somethings we don't even know which direction is the right one and which is the wrong one.  I don't know for sure if Aaron and I are meant to be together, but I am starting to realize that what I felt around him, just with him was something so powerful.  When I think my future, I can see him there.  Ok so he lives in Halifax and I am in Calgary, but those are just slight differences.  You know when I met him, he though I was perfect.  And yet I was just being myself - image that myself, and that is perfect to him.  To him I didn't need to change anything.  No one sees me that way.  Chels was with me that day we met - July 18, 2003 - I even remember the specific day.  Usually when guys meet Chels and I, they are always attracted to her.  Maybe cause she opens up more right away, maybe cause she is thinner, who knows.  For once though, someone was attracted to me though.  Me for once.  And that was a special feeling in itself.  I think that I might have given up something that could have been great.  We only stopped talking cause he lied to me.  I have trust issues and don't like people who lie - but I realize now that he was doing that because he didn't want to loose me.  I see the picture clearly.  Though his plan back fired, and he didn't realize that I am the kind of girl that just takes people for who and what they are.  That is just me.  He also needed a little work on the hygiene, but that can be fixed.  Everything else is perfect.  To each other we were perfect and if I ever got to see him again, then I KNOW that we would still feel the same.  He was a good looking guy, cute.  Even chels had to agree with me.  I always look at the pics from the summer.  I look at the smiles on our faces.  We had so much fun, with Aaron it was all about fun.  And that is what I want.  Lets put it this way - I miss chem, I miss chem, I REALLY REALLY miss chem.  I am a confused girl.  I am not about to go make judgments about my future but I know that I want to be a high school teacher, but now the question is what kind of teacher.  I know that I want to teach something related to the science area and have already ruled out physics because that's too math based and just not my thing.  So what is left then - Bio and Chemistry.  We haven't got totally into Bio yet, but I find it kind of dry although since most if memorization I am pretty sure I am going to be way better at that.  However, Chem I found VERY difficult, I mean honestly I thought it was the hardest thing that I have even done.  I like it though.  You know I thought I didn't like it, or the teacher, but my views and my opinions have totally changed.  The chem teacher is one of my most favorite teachers of all time.  At the beginning of the year I thought she was evil, now I think she is the coolest.  See I am confused though, I always seemed confused.  Because well I kind of want to teach Chemisty, which would be ok I was as smart as the chem teacher.  I mean I can barely balance a chemical equation properly and I want to be a chem teacher...!  I can't explain it, it's weird.  I mean why do I always want to do what seems hardest.  It would be easier to teach bio probably, because I would most likely be better at it.  Eventually I do have to decide though.  Will I major in Bio or will I major in Chem???  Do I choose the area that I like more or the one that I am better it????  So many questions and I have to decide before I apply to university next fall.  You know I am accomplished more than I have even thought.  I am not the naturally smart, talented, or gifted.  I am your hard worker.  I work for all my dreams.  I turn those dreams into goals, and I accomplish them.  Of course University if whole other challenge in itself.  I am afraid.  Afraid that if I choose Chemistry to major in I might get stuck in a rut of not understanding because I do find it very difficult.  Then University and all the money spent would be a waste.  If I choose Bio, it would be easier but still challegning and I could probably do it, but I wonder since it doesn't interest me as much as chem, would I get tired of teaching Bio.  You see I just don't know, and I guess that's life because really none of us have all the right answers.  You know I do think that I would make an excellent teacher.  I know what people go through.  I understand that people do need help and that things can get very hard sometimes.  I mean I have sat down enough nights just staring at the math book and crying, looking at it like it's some kind of foreign language, and not being able to answer the questions.  By some amazement no one even knows that, I keep it so well hidden.  I even managed to finish all my homework last semester and everything.  No one will even know how many people I had to ask to understand, and all the nights I had to cry to finally get a little bit closer to understanding.  In fact lots of people think I am really good at social too.  You know I guess it could be partially true, but really I don't seem to learn anything from that class.  I have just come up with my own techniques for getting good grades, not actually mastering the material.  For the long answer tests since they give the questions before I wrote the answers out, and then just memorized the answers.  After the test was done, everything I had memorized seemed to be erased from my memory.  I admit my study techniques suck - What study techniques is the question I should be asking!  You know teachers spend so much time or material and teaching it, but what they don't teach is how to properly study.  I mean of course I study all the time, but I often wonder if I am doing something wrong.  After all if I can't get the marks I deserve and want, then don't you think teachers should teach us how to properly prepare for exams.  I learnt more in Chemistry then in Social, but my Social mark was like way higher then Chem.  So what does that show anyway.  Are marks really an accurate way of showing how much people learn.  You know really a mark, a percentage - it's just a number that's all.  It doesn't define how much you know, or how much you don't know.  It doesn't determine you future (well usually it doesn't) so then why is there so much emphasize on them?  You know I never thought about that until now.  So now that I think of it, why would I let my Chem mark stop me from doing what I want to do.  It doesn't define me, or what I know.  So when the time comes to apply for University, which will come sooner than I am imagined, I am going to major in Chem because that is what I want to do.  I don't care if it's my lowest mark, highest mark, whatever it ends up to be.  Why would I let a number determine my future.  I will decide what I want to do based on my feelings.  After all I wouldn't major in something related to Social just because I have a high mark, so why would I choose not to major in something I have a lower mark in???  You know just thinking about this makes so much sense, like I feel I have gained about 2000 points towards my confidence level.  I think that if you believe, then anything can happen.  You bet I am going to make what I want it life happen.  I have made my dreams before into goals that I have achieved, so why not do it again.  I think I know what I want to do in life know.  I know now.  After High School I just have to do it.  I will be a High School Chemistry Teacher.  That's it.  It doesn't matter how far fetched that seems right now.  The things that are harder are always more of a challenge, but somehow I always go for things that don't come easy to me.  It just means I have to work harder to get what I want, and to get where I want to be.  I see clearly now.  I understand.
