Mike takes a double take and runs over to me and hugs and kisses and spins me. IT WAS SO AWESOME!    and when he was on stage playing the guitar for Nate......i almost died, that had to be the hottest thing in the world. aaaaaaaa boy+guitar= orgasmic.i love it. he got off stage and i like covered him in kisses.    i also got a drumstick and a promo CD yea!    and a bunch of people were there. Brandi gave me a kiss on the lips beore she left it was pretty cool. there was Lee, Nate, Cory, AJ, Jake, Chad, Zac, Mike, Brittany, Hannah, Lis, Jessie, Austin, aw fuckit.   I'm sorry Anthony.
