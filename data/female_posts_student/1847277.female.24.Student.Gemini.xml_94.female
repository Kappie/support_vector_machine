At least I only have one 9 am class this semester, and it only meets once a week.  Although I have grand plans of getting up and being at the museum by 9 every morning, anyway.  We'll see if it actually happens.  I know it won't this week, as Matt is home and I'd like to spend as much time with him as I can.  I'm actually looking forward to the majority of my classes this term, which is always a nice feeling.  But ugh, I am going to be oh-so-busy.  And it's already started, what with the fellowship application, and trying to work out scheduling with my profs (since I'm leaving early and all).    We'll see how it goes.   I'll probably post a post-first day wrap up this evening.
