I know, editing can be a bitch. But from what I've gathered, the video will be a blast! =p I've already gotten hold of the vcd of one of the fsv yr 1 videos. Feedback-ed to Lianne on the icebreakers stuff as well. Just to check the logistics stuff, has Julius contacted Wendy Wee and Mr Siew already for the artdsn  photog showcase? The games side (icebreakers, scavenger hunt) looks good and all set, so can someone (Simren?) coordinate with me and Ika on the logistics? Need to know if we have all the 'barang2' ready. As well as the screening stuff, if we're screening it on a lappy (audio tracks on cd, videos on vcd).   Cheers!
