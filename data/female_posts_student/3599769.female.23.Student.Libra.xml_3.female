(wah, wah) Okay I take some solace in knowing that I am in full "pity for myself" mode. So with that being clarified, let the ranting begin.   Says in her whiny, child baby voice:   Why can't I have you too make me see the silver lining in everything. Why can't I know that I don't have to always be the one that thinks or to work things out on my own. Why can't you do it #1 Fan? Where are you? For someone to over indulge me in gifts, know that they have bought me too much and spent way too much money. Or indulged me in  sweet nothings? And what the fuck is this guy looking at? -sorry. Or to call me and remind how wonderful my everythings are and to be so damm excited to call me you can hardly contain urself. ARGHHHH!! I'm just feel really frustrated right now. I want a #1 fan, and not in the stalking sense either. See if I had never beed adored at one point or another in my life by you, I wouldnt know what the hell I was missing. But you showed me what it was like and now its gone. So #1 fan, wherever you are, wherever you escaped to, come back and find me. I'll be waiting.
