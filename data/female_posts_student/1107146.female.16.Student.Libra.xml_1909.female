I was practically useless at choir sectional tonight, but...yeah.  So, anyway, my dad has gone to new heights to show that he is a prick.  Want info? Ask me later.  And keep your eyes peeled on the LiveJournal.  I agree about the holes.  I have one black sock with TWO holes in it.  I always say that I kicked a vampire in the mouth.  ;)  Yeah, so if you see me tomorrow, unless I tell you differently...try to talk into my right ear. Laters!  ~Z  Who is MC?  This post is nearly identical to the one on Antiphilanthropy, because posting here didn't work at first...oh, well.  Laters.
