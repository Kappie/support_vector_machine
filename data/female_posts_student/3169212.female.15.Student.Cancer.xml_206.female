ANd anyway, I first met Reeses a few years ago when Benjy-benjy-bed kidnapped her. I was just working on teh basis that it was a future version of her. Or an alternate reality thingy...   I should probably be worried that that whole sentece doesn;t cofuse me, or freak me out.      Well...she has been eating that Alim-whatsis stuff...you can't see it but i'm currenly shuddering.      Uh...well its not as if Teal'c speaks english as his first language so he'll probably be a slower reader...i wonder when he learnt to read english...?      Nice to know someone agree- hey! Were you insulting me?!      Definately some things you never *ever* do to a guy. Even the Evil snakes know that.      I agree, Reeses, they are slightly scary. ANd i want to know more about these Fronkeys...they seem like my kinda people...                   #59 D.W.A.R.F.- Weirdo; Keeper of the dimples.       		    urlLink    Yahoo!
