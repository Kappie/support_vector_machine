( In no specific order..just as they come to mind)  1.) ALL the JR. HIGH drama...I can't stand it...any of it is too much.  2.) Susan's constant crying...honestly, she's 13 now...crying more than once a day,      every day, is too, too much...  3.) Water that smelled worse than I did when I went to take a shower...that's just      not cool...nope..not at all....  4.) Having to share the shower with miscellaneous bugs, lizards, spiders, and giant      toads...for some odd reason, I enjoy my privacy...  5.) Having to sweep the cabin nearly every day, and on the days I wasn't the one to      sweep, it somehow ended up in mine, Aly's, Katy's, and Jen's side of the room...     coincedence, I think not..  6.) Being frozen nearly to death at night...women in menopause, need I say more???  That's all that comes to mind at the moment...if I think of anything else I'll add it to my blog...  I'm not promising that I'll write everyday...I'll try to when I'm here, but no promises...  Well, that's about it I think...  Oh yeah, I really missed some people...(some more than others..) Let's see..I missed: Flash, I really, really missed you...you'll never know how much... Thomas,yep...I actually missed and still do miss my big bro... my mom  dad...except them nagging on me, and me always getting in trouble by them...Ashley, even though I hardly ever talk to you anymore...we really need to get together sometime...hope your trip to the beach is/was alright...and some other ppl...but since not many ppl choose to read my blog, they aren't special enough to be added in it...and katy, you were with me, so I didn't really miss you any..  Well, I'm out.. I'll be back later.  Much Love,  Aub
