Here's the link:  urlLink    Chemistry Power!  yeah, so, michele,....well intentioned as she might be... that reassures me not one bit. Its not that im afraid it will be regreted...im sure if it happens, it will be...for the right reasons. something like that. but i dont know how im gonna accept that if it does happen...even if it wasn't in...a bad kinda way. i still dont know how im gonna accept it. Not that it makes you a slut or whatever if you do, cause...yeah...definitely not. i just...i dont want it to. i really dont want it to. and the likelyhood is that it will not happen.... but im not sure that it wont happen. and i cant be certain anymore now... it was a relief before to know it hadnt yet... i suppose i should just ask... bah. why is the whole thing such a big deal to me? i dont know! i wish i knew! maybe we should talk about it... ha. like we ever end up talking about anything i decide we should talk about. too many "i dunnos"...damn her. okay, anyway, enough thinking about that. my worrying wont change whatever happens right now. so ill just hope.  i want to talk though. real talk. i need some of that.  real  talk. like...intellectual conversation. philosophy. soul proding. haha, soul proding..well, i mean...learning things about the other person...below surface layer things. you know? i need some of that. i never get enough of that. can you ever get enough of that? i dunno... i dunno...  i need a boyfriend too. id take one of those... itd be worth it just to have something else to think about all the time. instead of constantly worrying about lots of different things...like i do now! well, at least its better now than it was...man, i was so f**king crazy earlier this year. im so glad thats over. that was horrible.  seriously  horrible. i never wanna do that again. but...i guess...ill have to. wont i? track starts soon... 5 aps next year. and field hockey. and marching band. and pit. :-/. im never gonna see...sigh...why did i have to pick such a masochistic one? damn! damndamndamn.   see? look. im worrying again. and...now...im worrying about college...just like i was earlier...sigh...its the car. i want a car in college. then, at least....or maybe i could live with public trans...well, nah. if only we lived in europe....  anyway, i need sleep so i should go now.  goodnight all. "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"
