I'm able to stay in touch with her better than I can with Sheryll because she lives in California. Pia and I have known each other since grade school -- so we've known each other for over fifteen years, by my estimation. I met Sheryll during my first year in high school (American translation: seventh grade) and we've been the best of friends ever since.    I'm glad that you like the look of the page Glee. I'd been tinkering around with it for the past few weeks and I think I've found a layout that I'm happy with. Hey, you're a word freak, aren't you? You should go to  games.com  and play me Scrabble. It's tons of fun !     Has anybody seen  Rock Star  yet? It's actually pretty good. I was surprised.
