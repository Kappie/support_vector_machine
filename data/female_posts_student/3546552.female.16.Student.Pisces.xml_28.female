I was at the  Sideras  house where I practiced my duet with  Rachel Primrose  for  Fine Arts , and then, got into a huge waterfight with  Madeline ,  Phillip  and  Nick . We all ended up drenched and had to eat lunch outside, but I'll tell ya, it was some fun! So now I'm home, and freshly showered...all ready for the next adventure which will be  cell group  considering that both  Andrew  and  Shaun  feel that they are up to it. LOL, I hope  Andrew  doesn't fall asleep! see you in a bit! bye. ~BS
