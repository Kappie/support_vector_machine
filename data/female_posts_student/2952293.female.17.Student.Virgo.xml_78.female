Then I went to school and did some more review, etc. Charlotte and Megan K presented in English class. Megan K played some violin to demonstrate a point- it was amazing. Then she had a book of show tunes, I wanted to hear some Aladdin, but Dr. D was all about something else. She had NEVER played it, but tried, and was perfect! It was awesome. Also, she had one of these music stands that folds up and I just really wanted it. We asked her if her poet, Langston Hughes, had any wives or kids. She said no and I said, "Sounds like my life, all alone" or something and only Maria laughed... oh it was great! Ms. King (Julie) baked us cookies for being so nice to her. They were yummy and math class was fun. History was one of the best we've had. First, Mr. O got a haircut and shaved his beard. Everybody was walking down the hall shouting, "Looking good O'Grady!" and "Hot stuff!" and whistling, it was great. Then we were discussing whether or not we should have gone into North Korea. Everybody was shouting out how they felt, and I was changing my decision, and O'G was going on and then he just bursts into "America the Beautiful" and everybody was still shouting. Then we all laughed. Ariel kepts shouting, "I have a question, I have a question!" and Kristen muttered under her breat, "JUST ASK IT!!" I love Kris. Then O'G was explaining CenTO and he says, "Big C, little E, little N, big T and O" and I ask, "Is that a big O?" and he goes, "Yeah, that's a big O" AHH I DIDN'T MEAN IT! We gathered around the chem room at break, our tradition before a test. It was funny, because on Friday I was telling everybody how whenever I go to my dermo I tell him what he wants and he writes me a prescription, well then on Saturday I found out... he died. It was sad, but isn't that weird how I mentioned him on Friday. The chem test was... A JOKE! It was so bad. It was a test unlike any we've had, yeah the last one was completely different. In the middle of the test I shouted out, "Doc, I've made up my own method of science!" The average is like a 54. That's great. I worked on Spanish fifth and sixth periods. Lunch was really awkward. Then I went in to give something to Señora and talk about my grade... I'm seriously getting a C in Spanish, no joke. She says, "Ajorge I do not eknow what the aproblem is. You are usually such a good estudent, but I eknow that you have had amany deaths, and you missed a whole week before the etest. But you know ajorge, I looked at the enational espanish exam and you got a 8%, that's not agood." 8% WHAT THE HELL? So I go to Señor's room, and he was really nice. We looked at my practice AP Spanish Language Exam (taking it tomorrow-wish me luck) and he was like "If you could do well on this, you DEFINITELY didn't get an 8%. You probably messed up the bubbles and screwed it all up." AHH I hope so. It was our last kickboxing, but we walked around the school. I had some nice chats with some folks, especially Margaret. Good luck on the game tonight girls! Then I stayed at school until 5:30 working on our Spanish project-hey group projects SUCK! Kidding, my group is good, I like them! Did I ever tell the story about the people I babysat for on Sat? Well, if I did, don't pay attention. When I was talking to her on the phone, she says, "Now, we are really normal people. I don't want you to be worried or anything, I mean it's fine, but we have a 19 year old girl living in our attic. Now, she can't be trusted around the children, so she'll just stay in her room." OKAY-THAT'S NOT SCARY AT ALL! Thankfully, she was out of town, my god people are weird these days. Well I leave you with this:   ELCB95: back like your mama browntrash182: ahhh you sayin my mamas got a big back? ELCB95: No way beeeeeach ELCB95: I got yo back ELCB95: like a mama got her baby ELCB95: back  ELCB95: ribs ELCB95: err..
