I knew we would. We did good...So yeah. That made me happy.  The rest of the day was just kinda laid back...cleaned the library and practiced the organ for about an hour.  Today was just...blah. Got up early for church...tho none of the alarms in our house worked....so I got up 15 mins before I had to be there. Woops. Oh well..I made it in time. Then after church I came home changed and went out to eat at Petes with the Hansen family. Then I came home changed again and went to my piano recital. I was sooo nervous...I couldnt stop shaking. But everything turned out great. I did super good on the organ. Everyone loved it. *sigh* They'll probably want me to play at chruch all summer. Ugh. Oh well. I'm getting good at it. Then I came home and changed AGAIN. Eh 4 different outfits today. lol. And then went to my Grandma Hansens for our lil Easter kidna thing. We just ate and got fat. And now here I am....So thats all for now....  -Tara
