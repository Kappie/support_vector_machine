Usually I drink more than I eat with Jerm, but because it was a girl's night, I ate a ton of food. And drank a fair bit of wine. After watching the Big Lebowski and doing the dishes, I started to feel really full. I mean,  really  freaking full. When I climbed into bed, I almost barfed, ran to the bathroom, didn't barf, climbed into bed, almost barfed, ran to the bathroom, and didn't barf. Finally I decided I was fine, but put a plastic bag near my head in order work with the Murphy's law that seemed to be going--place to barf equals no barfing.   I had bizarre and interesting dreams, as always, and then Lisa knocked on my door and said, "Waffles and coffee!" I think I mumbled something about, "Mwah? Just a minute. Ugh," and promptly fell right back asleep. I hear Liz and Lisa talking, and then the door front door shut and I woke up. It was like 9:30, which was a little bit earlier than I meant to get up, but reasonable. I ate my waffle and drank coffee, while watching E! News live. Now I'm probably going to Woodland with Liz to order grad announcements, though I made a list and I have like, 6 families that I for sure want to send announcements to (my grandparents and various aunts, uncles and cousins... Oh! I forgot my dad's side! Make that 8.) I'm contemplating getting creative on the computer with some fancy paper and a printer. I might have to make a visit to Papyrus this afternoon.
