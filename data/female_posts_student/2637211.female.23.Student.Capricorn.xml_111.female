Except for the stressful drive home, It's really nice to be here, except Jerm and I have been on the phone with Holly for the whole time we've seen each other. And in other exciting news, I switched out my earings for the first time since the December piercing experience. I think I want to get another hole in my ears, and I've been contemplating the belly-button. Any comments/ideas for non-creepy piercings?
