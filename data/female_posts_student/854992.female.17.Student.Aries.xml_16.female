	 
      you cried when she left and my heart wept for you scalding tears full of heft I did all I could to hold you  I walked for hours and hours And hoped to find your window You’ve told me so many times but this time I had to know  if you still pray in everyway that she’ll return again someday look for that girl with a heart that cries and beg her again to hide her lies and I will be forlorn and I will be forlorn  cry on my shoulder, and smile once more my heart will never be forsworn I know I’m always so insecure But I never matter anymore
