On  this  tour the Boys will be doing 3,000 seater venues.  Interesting indeed.    At first I was hardly pleased with what was supposed to be exciting news, as the very same article revealed the title of the first single from their upcoming album.   Climbing the Walls , a tune by who else but Max Martin.  But let's get back on topic.   Oh no!  I thought.   How will I ever adjust to tiny venues?!  How will it ever be the same?  The melodrama played out in my mind like a bad soap opera.    From the article I got the impression that Johnny Wright, their new (kind of) manager (he managed them in the beginning of their career), is starting the Backstreet Boys all over again.  When they debuted as a group they weren't doing so well in the United States, so they headed on over to Europe where they were accepted instantaneously.  Funny thing, too.  Now all European fans think they have some kind of right to the Boys because they gained popularity there first.   Chuckle.   So here's what I think.  They're touring Europe to ignite the smothered Backstreet flame there, and doing so in small venues so as not to embarrass themselves if they don't fill arenas.  That's fine.  And smart.  If they do the same in the United States, I won't be heartbroken but I do wonder what it'll be like.  Hopefully it will be easier to get closer seats and perhaps better concert photos will be the result.  We'll see.  What I'm most interested in at this point is the music.   Beautiful Woman  has been proof enough that they are capable of giving their sound a fresh and edgier style that would undoubtedly do well on the charts given the right promotion.  And you know what?  I want edge, but I also want that classic Backstreet feel, which there's no doubt in my mind they will deliver beautifully.  Alright, if I'm being honest, they could record a song with lyrics consisting of names and numbers out of a phone book and it would be better than anything on top 40 radio right now.  It's Backstreet 2004 and I'm ready for their return.  Oh so ready.
