But for now,lemme just say that I really love this guy. *Cant believe Im yours  ur mine*  If I Aint Got You - Alicia Keys Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power, yeah Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what’s within And I been there before but that’s life’s a bore, so full of the superficial  Chorus: Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything But everything means nothing if I aint got you, yeah  Some people search for a fountain The promise is forever young (You know) Some people need 3 dozen roses And that’s the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter And what good would it be? With no one to share with no one who truly cares for me  Chorus: Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything But everything means nothing if I aint got you, you, you Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything But everything means nothing if I aint got you, yeah  If aint got you with me baby, ohh, ooo Say nothing in this whole wide world don’t mean a thing If I aint got you with me baby.
