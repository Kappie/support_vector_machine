It has got all to do with the guys..hahahah LOL.. come on think about it girls generally do NOT have an over busting ego that seems to spill all over the place.. ok some of you would call me a feminist..but seriously only guys seem to be egoistic..There is this thing in them telling them that they should be better than others and that they should not lose to a girl and that they are the best and everything that others do is not that great after all etc etc hahah ok let me give some credit.. not all guys are like that of course ( I do know some guys who are just damn nice).  But on the other hand.. I think everyone should have a fair amount of ego but it should not reflect a great deal on your character..I mean you should have enough self esteem and self confidence but not go over board with it.. I guess it's hard to draw the line it just comes naturally...
