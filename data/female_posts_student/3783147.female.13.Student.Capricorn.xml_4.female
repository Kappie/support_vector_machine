Judy said he likes me but i am not sure if i should trust her lol!! I really like him tho! most of my friends allready know that one!! lol!! I went to see David Wions Concert @ the Dayton Art institute and i got to sit by Eric. the only bad part was that he kept poking me in the arm w/ his elbow but that was ok still. OOO and he was wearing cologne and it smelled really good lol!! i know that sounds really corny but i dont care he did smell good and i am aloud to say it!! but everytime he moved or like the wind blew on him i got this big wiff of this really good smelling person. lol! well i am going to go now!
