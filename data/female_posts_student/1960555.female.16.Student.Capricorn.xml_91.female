Karma! Thanks for being uber good friends and telling me when i become the queen of all things drama.  i know that i have a flair for the dramatics, but sometimes i just need to mellow out!  I think everything "boy" related issue is somewhat sorted out now, so the stage queen has temporarily left the blog.   So I was home sick from school today old to learn that I missed the greatly anticipated milk challenge.  Matt came out on top to the suprise of all, with Adam close behind and Alex/Nick crapping out after half a jug.  From what I hear tho, if Alex had continued after the initial hurl he totally would have kicked ass.  Then there's Nick with his homo milk.  Smart move Nick, cause homo won't end in your untimely demise.  Sounds like good times were had by all tho.  We can all just hope for a rematch at a later date.
