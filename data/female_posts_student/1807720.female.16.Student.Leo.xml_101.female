My face was like swormed and omg I have to get rid of em' before school starts again cause I hate wearing make-up to non-speacial-occasions but if I have to hide my face then I will!  I am breaking out more now on this break then when we had school.  I assume it's from Mat that is really stressing me out.  I feel so good today though.  My sister came and we watched American Wedding which was hilarious and then like I got my hair done.  It's really dark with blonde and red going through it.  It's soooo awesome - I love it!!!
