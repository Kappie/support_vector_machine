They were sorted out today.( After coming to XII, basically the problems arises, when people start going out, and then they cant give much time to their old friends, which becomes pretty disgusting.) Anyhow, things got sorted out , with enormous help from Soumya. Well, there still remains one person, with whom the problems still persist,.. Anyhow, a lovely day. I have just returned from my piano class, and finally I got my teacher to teach me Sounds of Silence, and when she played it for me, it was simply heaven. Its raining too.  Fiitjee Phase Tests are on 28-29th August , so most probably, my frequency of writing posts will slow down. Please excuse.
