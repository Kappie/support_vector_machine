ANYWAYS, I'll hopefully write in this blog every day and use my other blog for what it was made for: There Events, articles, and the like...but that means I'll actually have to attend events...nahhhhhh. Might keep this blog a secret that not everyone knows about: I have NO idea as to who reads my newsletter!  My other two Blogs can be found here:   urlLink Andorra's Newsletter for There events    urlLink Emily's Site  (This one was supposed to be for rl stuff but...that didn't work out too well because I didn't want to talk about rl in the end.)   urlLink    It's ME...yeah...I couldn't find a place to put my picture for the url for my profile so I had to post it so I could take the url *hangs head in shame*. urlLink
