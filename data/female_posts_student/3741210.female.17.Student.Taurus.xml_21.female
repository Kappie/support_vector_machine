Catie was gone and I didnt feel like calling Kelly or Kathryn. (I think since Kel doesnt see her Mom all day, she wants to be at home at night to talk to her. That's my theory any way.) There was nothing on TV like there never is in summer. I wanted to go bug Amit at McDonalds (and maybe get some free food) but Steve  also  took the car.  My dad was trying to teach me how to play golf but I got sick of that quickly. I guess I'm going to take lessons with my brothers and sister. At least it will be something to do. --O yay! Amit just got on, now I have someone to talk to.   I'm not usually this pathetic. I swear.
