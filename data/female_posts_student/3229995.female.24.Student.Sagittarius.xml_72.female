It features Kurt Russell, Kim Cattrall (Samantha from Sex in the City. I bet she's proud of tis one...) a 2000 year old Chinese transvestite, a flying one eyed blob, a hairy monster and a lot of really crap martial arts fight scenes. Kurt Russell's wears his west tucked into his jeans, which are pulled up almost to his armpits, a mullet haircut and boots that can shoot knifes. He is the coolest guy in town. "No horse shit" Jack Burton.   THE PLOT  We are in San Francisco, where Jack the all American macho truck driver goes to the airport with his Chinese buddy, Wang, to pick up his fiancee coming from China. He meets a mysterious female lawyer he fancies while the girlfriend is kidnapped by a China town street gang "The Lords of Death"(!) They are dressed in the ultimate 80's "thug" gear: Headbands, Michael Jackson style leather jackets and enormous sunglasses. In trying to rescue her, Jack and Wang come into all sorts of trouble (as you do...) It turns out the fiancee is captured by Lo Pan, a 2000 year old evil magician who rules an empire of spirits beneath San Fran's Chinatown. He can only return to a mortal life if he marries a girl with green eyes.(It has taken him 2000 years to find that apparently). Gracie the lawyer also has green eyes, and is captured as well, Lo Pan decides to marry them both after all those lonely years...    The guys get help from an old Chinese man named Egg (!) and make their way through the sewer underground to the Wing Kong Exchange where Lo Pan has started the wedding ceremony. They have to get through 3 guys with supernatural powers wearing lampshades on their heads and shooting electricity out of their fingers, the Room of the Upside-Down Hell and a whole lot of black magic monsters. And what happens in the end? The bad guy dies, Jack and Gracie fall in love, Chinatown is once again a safe place...and Jack hits the road again.   WHO WROTE THIS DIALOGUE?  Jack complains about the loss of his truck, Wang says: "How do you think I feel Jack? I lost the whole girl!" Toasting a drink that will give them supernatural powers in the rescue: Wang: "Here's to the army and navy, and the battle's they have won, here's to America's colours, the colours that never run." Jack: "May the wings of liberty never loose a feather." Egg while explaining some "Chinese history": "Anybody who showed up was going to join Lim Lee in the Hell of Being Cut to Pieces. Jack: "Hell of what?" Egg: "Chinese have a lot of hells."
