I'm a little less homicidal and/or pessimistic, and well...ah crap I've lost my train of thought *hears 'choo choo' sound as she looks to the left and sees a train chugging away.* I don't know...So my dad came home for a visit last night (he works out of town in Coronach) so I camped over at Autumn's to escape his ass-holy-ness. Anyway...so he picks me up from her house today and right off the bat starts bitching about my bracelet. "You can't be wearing that. You could take someone's eyes out. The spikes are too long." so I just said to him "I spent like $7 on this, I'm not throwing it in the garbage." He shut up. I think he's starting to realize that he aggravates me to no end, because whenever he comes home I'm never there. And for good reason. I hate him and I don't want to see him, or see as little of him as I can. Luckily, though, he's going back to Coronach tomorrow. I just can't get over how fucking moody he is. Take today for example. I called him to see what's new over there (my house). At first he's all peachy keen, and then I was like, "Well, could Autumn come over for a little bit?" then he's like "Well..." then I said "Well, if you don't want her to, it's alright..." then he fucking trips and says "I DIDN'T SAY THAT. STOP PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH. I HATE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT." He pisses me off. Anyways, I'm a little "happier" now, I guess...but I'm still not going to try and make everything better. I'm still just gonna sit back and watch what happens, hoping for the best. Whatever happens, I'll deal with it somehow. Later.
