Some have one or two friends but most of them are feeling lost and confused and wishing like hell that they were somewhere else.  Did we put too much emphasis on this city?  On this school?  Did we leave our comfortable worlds assuming that we would end up making a new comfortable world?  We were all idiots if that is what we thought.  So here we are in Boston, Cambridge, Allston, wherever wishing that life were a little bit more like it has been in the past.  Sadly, knowing that almost everyone is in the same boat as me, makes me feel that much better.  :)  Your misery is my joy.
