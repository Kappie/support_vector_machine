The cold “ber” breeze is rounding its way inside my room as I try to locate the moon. Haay…I haven’t seen any Christmas lights yet in the vicinity but I could feel the different crackle of the air…December is near.  I remember when I was in college, when I came home from Manila to celebrate sem break, my friends and I would gather immediately and plan a party. Now, I hardly go out, let alone have my friends over, because everyone seems to be living their own lives and they get much more attached to making money…and planning a family.   I took out the pictures from way back 1996-2000…and there’s this heavy feeling inside that engulfed my whole being tonight. Those woebegone days seem so long and yet, memories are still fresh…not necessarily haunting, but more on…wondering if we’ll ever be together as a whole again.   There’s one thing to say, it’s never good to have a relationship with a barkada, ‘coz if you don’t end up together, you’ll probably be hurting each other and the people around you more…and later regret the hurtful things that were uttered. My barkada BF of 5 years happen to marry someone else, and it started a rift among us…it was really bad. Now, that I’ve moved on, they couldn’t help but offer me congratulations…I was lucky enough to have escaped the clutches of early marriage due to accidental pregnancy.  Though the experience hurt me more, I still tried to be strong, maybe at that time, I was nursing my hurt pride, but I realize it was not about pride, but about hoping to salvage what was left of the friendship that started it all.   As I come across pictures of us together with the whole group, I kinda miss the thrill, the excitement, the companionable silence and most of all, the laughter shared by all every time we venture out to enjoy the rest of our vacation.   Closing the last photo album, a tear fell…not because I remember how hurt I was, but, of how good it was yet it had to end. Some good things really don’t last even if you’re swept away with emotions converging all at once or even with the foundation of friendship that started when you were still but kids.
