Also the exam looks like it's going to be easy. This is good, because even if it seemed like it was going to be hard I probably wouldn't have studied much. This course is  mine !! Muahaha. Now, watch me fail. *g*   So anyway, I'm glad T worked everything out with ya-know. Of course that still leaves the question as to why she's waiting outside the school for him every morning... and even more so, why she runs away and shrieks when his car drives in. I'm confused. Does she want to talk to him or no? I'm going to stop talking about this subject, because earlier I said I didn't want to get involved. This is between T and lover-boy. So, I'll stop. *stops*   Now... what else to talk about. Getting a hair-cut on Saturday, which is cool. I'm hoping she'll also wax my eyebrows. Dammit I hate plucking loll! And then I get my braces off next Wednesday, so yayy I can be a super-model again... *gags* hah. no. Wonder what everyone'd say if I came to school without  any  makeup on? It would be an interesting experiment, but one I am far too afraid to try *g*   I have a piano exam in... 3 weeks. I am scared out of my wits, because I am not prepared. I've hardly memorized my pieces!! Of course, it's my fault, because I don't practice nearly as much as I should, but still. I should probably stop complaining then. It seems like a lot of topics heavy on my mind are off-bounds. *pouts*   What else... ooh! Next period we have a part of the music exam. Hell, on Monday we've got  the  music theory exam. I am screwed for both. I can sing back intervals, but I sure as hell can't name 'em. I don't think I have a very good ear *sigh* Dazok. But I remember singing back intervals in my last piano exam, and that was fine. I did well in that. But aiee! Naming is hard. I lost that sheet saying which song sounds like which interval... blargh. I'm pretty sure I'll survive. BTW, on that whole musicalness topic -- A should totally have been the one to play with the grads. I'm so mad no one else realized that. She is the best frikkin flutist in our class, and yet nobody backed down for her! That makes me mad. She totally deserved that most. Who cares if she's gonna be in Alberta for that!!   So's anyway, J just gave me all the song stuff for the music test next period, so I'll leave to study. Byee!
