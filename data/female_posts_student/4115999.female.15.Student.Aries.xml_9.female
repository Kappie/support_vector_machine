Well anyway, this guy called at 5:30 in the freakin morning asking for someone named Jenny....Well it took awhile for me to convince him that no one named Jenny lives here. I swear it was so aggravating. Well, dad doesn't get home till like 11 tonight, kinda cool. I really want to go to the mall this weekend, I feel like shopping. I want to go to Sweden. Don't know why just do. Geez...I am so bored, I need to do something....Maybe I'll go for a run or something. Eh maybe not it's kinda hot outside. Plus I'm way to lazy for that type of thing. Well, I have nothing else to bore you with at the moment.
