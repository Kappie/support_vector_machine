(btw they r all by Evanescence).  "Tourniquet"  i tried to kill the pain but only brought more i lay dying and i'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal i'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am i too lost to be saved am i too lost?  my God my tourniquet return to me salvation my God my tourniquet return to me salvation  do you remember me lost for so long will you be on the other side or will you forget me i'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am i too lost to be saved am i too lost?  my God my tourniquet return to me salvation my God my tourniquet return to me salvation  my wounds cry for the grave my soul cries for deliverance will i be denied Christ tourniquet my suicide   "Imaginary"  i linger in the doorway of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name let me stay where the wind will whisper to me where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story  in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullaby i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me  don't say i'm out of touch with this rampant chaos - your reality i know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge  the nightmare i built my own world to escape  in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullaby i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me  swallowed up in the sound of my screaming cannot cease for the fear of silent nights oh how i long for the deep sleep dreaming the goddess of imaginary light  "My Immortal"   Iâ€™m so tired of being here suppressed by all of my childish fears and if you have to leave i wish that you would just leave because your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone   these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  you used to captivate me by your resonating light but now i'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone and though you're still with me i've been alone all along
