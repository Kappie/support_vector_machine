Well last night i had this long talk with adam and eli and they both were cracking jokes on greg, cody, matt, and beaner... at first it was funny to hear what they were saying about these boys, but after awhile i was like getting tired of it, so i stuck up for the people who basically made fun of me and told me that they hated me... then i antiqued krissy ( pouring flour all over someone when they are sleeping) she woke up the next morning and didnt know what the fuck happened... it was funny. Then i slept in till 2... heres where it gets good. I went to borders and bought the Book (a fat girls guide to life) and i started reading it and got sucked in bc what this woman went thru is everything i have been thru, and i have had the same feelings about things and its just nice to hear someone else that has survived a weight battle. See it takes me so long to lose weight, then i gain it back, like i have been doing already :( so ive been all down and depressed about it, but reading this book is making me feel better. Then i went to krissys and rara was there, and i was already in a bad mood, and they made comments about me being a princess, and idk why , but it pissed me off so i left, i cried to my mom down at her work and i was crying about everything but what happened at krissys lol it was like i needed to cry about alot of shit. ( ive been a sap lately, ill cry over n e thing lol ) then i went home and got on my pjs (i was in hoochie mamma clothes and didnt want to be n e more lol ), and went back to krissys where rara and heather were and we all decided we would play monopoly, where i was winning by a shit load, and heather was fucking around on the computer, and she wasnt even paying attention and what happens??? i land on her boardwalk and lose  ALL of my money except for 6 bucks! but i came back and got in 2nd place with 8,580! so that and stick it in ur piehole! lol and we played Monopoly for 5 hours, lol which is sad considering it was a friday night lol OH and heather told friggin David that i had sex with Derek! so now David is gonna tell people all this shit, and its just gonna make my life hell.. lol but o well , so yah tonight was pretty much drama and we ended it on a low note... altho now im grounded bc i got home at 3:37 and thats too "late" so poor me... but ill be out tomorrow, u watch and see.. :) Grounded at my house? Nahhh!!
