She told her mom about her being bi and her mom didn't take it so well. I wished I could jsut take her pain away. Sometimes I think it would be easier if we never met. That way she could be happy her mom wouldn't say hurtful things to her and she wouldn't be in pain. I just want to run away and never come back
