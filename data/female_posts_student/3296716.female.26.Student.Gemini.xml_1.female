I got a very positive e-mail from Dr. G last night saying that I was on the right track, and also saying that my insights were good and that I had brought up some interesting points. He recommended a few books: The Post-modern Condition by Jean Francois Lyotard (which of COURSE I will read, as I am a huge fan of postmodernism) and a book by Pierre Bourdieu called Reproduction in Education, Society, and Culture. This second book sounds much less interesting, but I will check it out anyway- I'm sure it will be useful :)  Yesterday I took notes on the first chapter of D'Andrade's book, The Development of Cognitive Anthropology.   D'Andrade defines cognitive anthropology as the study of the relationship between human society and human thought. (I loved this definition, because it was very clear and didnt' throw in any words like discourse or enculturation or anything else intended to make the author appear superior and the reader to feel stupid.)  It is the study of the ways that people in social groups (societies, subcultures, etc.) concieve of and think about teh objects and events which make up thier world. This includes everything from physical objects like houses and clothing to abstract events like chairty and social justice.   Ch. 1 is a lot of background- D'Andrade goes all the way back to the dawn of Anthropology. He says that ethnography was originally the observational study of the ways of life of "primitive" people, which of course bothered me, because "primitive" implies social evolution, which I think is crazy (I will expand on this later). He expands on this, saying that early ethnographers were interested in the ways in which particular cultural traits diffused from one society to another, and that they were strongly divided on whether or not societies evolved in a series of stages from simple hunting people to complex urban civilizations or were simply involved in non-evolutionary, non-directional, multiple processes of change- an argument that is still not resolved.   He also brings up an idea of "agenda hopping" where he talks about how the focus of the discipline has changed over the years. I wasn't really very clear on this- I'll have to talk about it with Gordon. He said that the new agenda of the early 20th century (which sounds like it would be obsolete by now, right?) is "focused on the detailed examination of how the institutions of society are integrated together to make society function." These institutions of society are not just a jumble of traits, but rather  a set of learned and prescribed activities which are coordinated with one another to bring about a satisfactory way of life and maintain social order .  I have to briefly talk about social evolution and why it bothers me so much. It is completely arrogant and ethno-centric. We evolve into more powerful and complex societies? Why is this deemed something as noble as "evolving"? I think sometimes this theory is completely backwards- that in some cases societies that are seen as "primitive" are really more advanced in some areas than our own. What are the attributes used to judge this evolution and advancement? Poverty? Illness? Longevity? Procreation? Weapons of mass destruction? Military Power? Material wealth? Some of these things have no place in "advanced" society, depending on who's opinion you hear.   And of course, this whole theory was devised by western culture, putting themselves at the very top, as the standard for all societies that are still evolving....
