It was so incredibly bitchy ... and I kept apologising and she just threw it back in my face.  Not that I had anything to apologise for.  And Mel goes on about how our code names for Clare and Charlotte are "thirty-six year old man" and "Harris".  Huh?! Where did that come from??  And Charlotte goes, "You and Pooj are becoming the same person." She didn't even explain what the hell she meant.  We say stuff at the same time, like the same music, fancy the same guys, but apart from that, we're total opposites! Well, um, we're like, the same height and stuff too, but ... okay fine, we're very similar, but still.  She's just trying to  be  Clare, whereas Pooj and I can't help it that we're exactly the same.  I think I smoothed things over.  God, I hope I did. I've got half term to be as sweet as canned sugar to them, and this whole thing will be over. It's horrible!! I really wanna know what they've been saying about me, though ... hmm.  I want to know, but I don't.   I've got to put Snood and Smelly to bed, but they won't go in *beats head against table* they won't go in!! Oh well, it's not my problem.  I just need to remember to watch Lenny Henry.  And no one's coming online!  Darn! Must change my name to Snow Patrol lyrics.  You know, Elliott fills all my critea for the perfect bloke.  1) he's gorgeous (even though he looks like a mushroom when he's not wearing hairgel), 2)he's waaay outta my league, 3) he likes Muse, Foo Fighters and Snow Patrol, so he's got good music taste, 4) he dresses skater, so he can dress well (and he's got this top with a monkey on it swinging on a vine with a cast around it's arm and it say, 'I am a slow learner' or something.  Aww!), 5) I'm sure he's got a good personality ... 6) he MUST be rich because he comes to Bablake and he forked out Â£900 on a trip to America.  So maybe he was rich, and isn't any more ... anyway, he's absolutely great.    And if nobody minds, I'm just going to change the address of this now so Katherine can't find it!  Ha ha ha!   Must go, *~Jools~*
