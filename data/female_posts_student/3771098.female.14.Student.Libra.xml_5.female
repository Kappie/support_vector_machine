Well she called back and left a message telling me I had won something. I got my mom to call her back (seeing as how i hung up on her) and it turns out that if you're under 18 or 21 or something that you can't win stuff! How gay is that? Anyway, I was still happy because I did win (i don't even know what i "won") and i never win anything, EVER. So that was cool. Alright. bye!  liz
