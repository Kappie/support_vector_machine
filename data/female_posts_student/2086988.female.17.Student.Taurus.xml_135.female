I could understand maybe once or twice. But, after like what 10 times? Making the same mistake over and over again...it's insane. And I have to sit back and watch it all. I can't say anything, because I don't want to lose my best friend and also, would it really do any good? She's almost 18, if she hasn't learned it all by now, she never will. It makes me mad, she keeps making the same mistake over again and then she gets caughts and has to face punishment from her parents. She lied to be about what she did in April, and then tonight she did it on 3 different occasions. And it was REALLY REALLY sick, like never in my wildest dreams would I ever EVER try anything like that...And then that brings me to discuss Christianity. People wanna know why I'm not like so into it. Maybe because the majority I know are ALL hypocrites. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Christian and I know really sweet ones. But people like Kiera piss me off. "Oh I'm so good, I go to church everyday and I read the bible. And on my spare time I give cock to random guys! But Jesus still loves me" Seriously, WTF is wrong with these people? Do they feel the need to rebel because there parents have sheltered them with religion? My parents never forced me to go to church and they also gave me a more spiritual upbringing then religious and I turned out ok...Ahhh sometimes people just amaze me...   When you came my way You brightened every day With your sweet smile
