Then on Monday I am going to my grand parents for about a week. I do not know If I will get a chance to write there or not. I am looking at this msn group called Ask A Witch Community. The title of this post is a link to the webpage if you want to visit it. I joined, it seems good so far. I am waiting for someone to book the chat room for a wicca class. Not that I really need it, but I would like to see what it's like, I have never talked to another wiccan over the internet, or get taught a lesson by someone else. I might learn something to, wich would be cool. I always taught my self by trial and error. I really would like to open my own wicca/pagan website, maybe on geocities or something. Maybe one day, maybe not. I really do wish I knew of other wiccans/pagans. I have never met a pagan, and I have only spoken to a few other wiccans. I hope, one day when I have children, they will take to paganism or wicca. I would never push them to. It really is a lovely way to live. Less stress because your mind is more open, and developed to deal with things, and figure ways out of problems. It is hard to explain. I will try to write on Sunday if I can, but I do not know what time I will be getting home, and I leave early Monday morning, but I will try.
