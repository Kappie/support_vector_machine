Elisa ended up being a last-minute addition, and I'm really glad she came. She seemed to have fun and I think it was nice for Victoria to have someone more her age. It was also great to have Carol there: another adult for me to talk to and to trust with caring for the teens. :-) Lee was camping with a friend, James couldn't go, and Michael started a new semester at Moorpark yesterday.   There's really not too much to say about the trip. Everything was pretty smooth and everyone seemed to have a good time. This event ends up being David's last big event with the youth group as a member. He leaves for college on the 25th. It will be hard to see him go, but I know he'll have a great time at Pepperdine.   I think I realized that I'm liking Disneyland better now, though. A lot of the rides knocked me around quite a bit and made my head hurt. I love the power of a roller coaster, but I don't enjoy headaches. Now that I'm passed my teenage years, though, I appreciate the creativity and overall atmosphere of Disneyland better. Funny. Growing up is a strange process.   Elisa was baptized on Sunday. I didn't get to mention that. I was so excited when I heard it, I nearly cried. Her mother said that she felt closer to God at Kings Kamp than she'd ever felt and wanted to get baptized. Her dad did it during worship. How wonderful to add another sister to the body of Christ!   Now I must prepare to go shopping with my mother. That is, I need to take a shower. :-)
