Or maybe I'm just selfish.  So life kinda sucks right now.  Prelims in less than 12 days.  Looking like India may not happen, but still won't know for sure until December.  Too late for South Africa. :( Jerrywill just suggested that perhaps I could still go to Burkina Faso, and I COULD ask Stephen and Daphne, although I'd probably have to pay for my own plane ticket.  Or I could ask Augustin if he'd take me to Senegal...  Hmm... Guess there are still some options.
