It only makes it hotter because of the humidity. I might as well to go Jersey, because that is what it feels like here. Meh. I could go get in the pool, but that requires going and putting on my swimsuit and going out to the pool, alone...and the water is colder than I want to be exposed to. This world is evil.  I took 10 days off from work to go with Mathew to Portland in like two weeks or something, that should be great. I also work everyday this week except Monday and Tuesday, which will be nice, because I will get some hours before I leave for 10 days, that way my paycheck won't take that much of a beating. Phew.  I really shouldn't take all that time off work though. My car needs a new muffler, no let me rephrase that. It NEEDS a muffler. Mine fell off a while back and I need to put a new one on it, something about safety or something....whatever. But that requires having 200 some odd dollars. By the way, I DID have that kind of money, but I bought a.....puppy.....yes, that's it a puppy. So, now I don't have that kind of money. Damn puppies. *shakes fist* I could take the thing back, but that just doesn't fit into what I want to do this month, and some things are taking a higher priority these days....You know how it is. Well, maybe you don't but that doesn't matter. So, deal with it.   I'm going to miss my Mathew, I know that.... But I think I can handle it. I know I can handle it, I love him, more than anything in the world, and I can wait. Not leaving your thoughts is the same as having someone there right? No, but oh well. The wind just picked up, and mum said it was cooler outside, I'm going to go investigate.  Fucking Kangaroos...*scribbles them out*  Ciao~
