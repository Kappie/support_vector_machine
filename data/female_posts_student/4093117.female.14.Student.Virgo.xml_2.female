All I've done was sat around in Newspaper, got a few more quotes from people, spent an hour asking people to buy ads (which none of them did), and bought a lovely black and white scarf from this one store to be used as a belt. And now I have to add more quotes and kind of rewrite my articles. Although I did get a few leads, I was still kind of disapointed that I didn't sell any ads. One girl from the Student Council gave me some useful quotes and for some odd reason I almost had some sort of nervous breakdown. It was really wierd... well last night the lady at Copperfield Books was kinda scary. She asked if we printed the book list and I said "well we could include that in your ad..." and she said "That's not what I'm asking. I SAID do you print the booklist in your newspaper?" She said kind of loudly as if I'm some kind of idiot. But I do know for a fact that the X-Treme Hair design place will buy an ad and that the Shear Sophisticates will most likely want to buy an ad tomorow, too. Oh crap I have the hiccups. I hate the hiccups, and yet I love them. One final thing before I go- have you ever been awoken in teh middle of the night by two cats in a fight outside your window? Well I was last night and let me tell you that is the CREEPIEST sound to hear at night. At first there was a *thump* which initially woke me. Then, half asleep mind you, I hear this eerie screaming sound followed by a hiss. Of course, I'm like "Oh my god there's some sort of demon out my window." But then I heard another hiss followed by a yowl and then it hit me- cats. *Shudder* oh they can burn in hell for all I care. Actually, I believe that's where they end up since all dogs go to heaven.
