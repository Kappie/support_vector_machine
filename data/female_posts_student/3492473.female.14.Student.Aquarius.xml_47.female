Ate, (only one bowl of cereal! Usually, it's two or three...What? I'm a hungry girl!), got ready, and left. First, I was in pants and my mom made me change into shorts because she said I'd be hot. Then, as we about to leave, my step dad was like, "I'm gonna need your help in the garden today..." I was pissed! I was not in any mood to work  in the garden I planted.  (about 100 tomato plants and like 25 pepper plants...) I wanted to just read and relax there today! So I had to go and change into crappy clothes really quick and change my shoes. We had to take two cars because both my mom and brother had work afterwards so Eddie needed his car. So I went with Eddie in his car and my mom, step dad, and pups went in the other car. So we went to the Mini Mart, got a newspaper (for my grandpa of course), and got on the freeway.I guess the part we usually take to my grandpa's house was being worked on because there was a detour. Eddie didn't wanna follow it so we turned around, went back to Wick, and took 84 there.When we got there, my mom was like,  "OMG! Where were you?!I was soo worried!"  It was funny. So I went to slave in the garden while Dave (my step dad) tried making Eddie help but Eddie refused because he had work right after and because the damn tomato ties kept ripping. We were tying the tomato plants by the way. He went inside and fell asleep on the couch. At the beginning, Dave tried showing me how to tie a tomato to a stake so I was like, "I already know how to...I've done this before." I mean, come on, I'm the girl who grew up around this garden. But Dave flipped and started yelling at me. First instant where I wanted to cry today. Whenever he yells at me, I always wanna cry. He just has the ability  of breaking a person down.  But later he said sorry for that and the only reason he flipped was because he just wanted one chance to explain something.I miss my real dad...  But I always do.  No one could ever replace him. But anyways, later, he's like, "Want some of my pop?" "HELLO! I DON'T DRINK POP!" Really starting to annoy me that my parents don't know that. So, when I was done in the garden, my arms were soo dirty.It looked like they were covered in blood, so some thoughts ran through my head, but I washed 'em and I wasn't bleeding.  I think I murdered some tomato plants but that's what they get!  But I did get three mosquito bites around my right knee. And I kept itching 'em and Dave was like, "STOP!" I hate when people tell me to stop itching bites or something. It's not your body so back off! So I left and went home. Cleaned, did crunches, read, talked to Alecia, Margaret,and Sheryl, and ate. I felt pretty sick afterwards. But that seems to happen a lot.Got ready for soccer and left. Uh, soccer was just a mess today. I was horrible. Felt like crying  a lot  during soccer. I was seriously horrible. I missed easy shots and everything. Uh... Well, everyone has bad days...Let's not talk about that anymore! Margaret was suppose to be there @ 8 to pick me but as usual she forgot...well, actually she fell asleep so that pissed me off even more. Came home, complained to Eddie about Margaret, watered neighbors flowers, (the ones in the front are dying or something... they look bad!  but the ones in the back are really good), Kevin came over, did Mark. with Margaret, (spending moneyalways cheers me up or something), had more drama with Dave (the guy thinks he's dying as soon as he gets low blood sugar...he's a diabetic n a drama queen), Eddie went out with friends, and I finished reading Chapter 8 of LOTF. Only four more fucking chapters...  Now I'm here. Wow. What a life.
