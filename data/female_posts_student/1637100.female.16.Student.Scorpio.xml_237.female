So just imagine how they'll flock when they know you've been matched with Prince William himself!   Though his official title is "His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales," he'd prefer it if you just called him "Wills." That's right, the hottie, heir apparent to the throne is your teen celebrity match. He's sexy (at 6'2"), single (just starting college), and smart (straight A's).   This royal bachelor would be more likely to take you to a hidden pub to raise a few pintsâ€”strictly a jeans-and-sweater affair, mind you, than take you on a tour of the Castle. You're sure to notice a down-to-earth wisdom beyond his years as this born leader has grown up in the public eye. And even if he didn't have that sexy English accent, how could you resist him as he looks into your eyes and tells you how dedicated he is to helping the environment, or you.   So if you want a nice intimate evening, just you, Wills, and a couple bodyguards (and the royal jet if you're lucky), this great Briton is all yours. After all those times people have called you "Princess" wouldn't it be nice if you could play the part for real and make the world a better place?
