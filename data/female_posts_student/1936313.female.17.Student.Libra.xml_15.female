Kevin had to work... so I'm still angry at him.. hehehe... It was nice... I got to have a 'girls day out' with someone other than my Aunt or Megs... (uh.. no offence to Megs... and my Aunt.. neh.. if you haven't heard stories of those adventures... be thankful..)  Sooo kinda-lunch (it was like 3:00) and a movie and some one on one time to talk with Allie..... I think I've come to a final decision about college..... though I still want to talk to my Cr.Wr. teacher and the counselor about it.... but yea... I'm heavily leaning towards MHC and the UofR for Journalism.... a lot lot lot more work...but the dividends are much larger as well... and I think I'll be happier....................... hooray for having a student loan until I die.  Andrew gets back from Banff tonight...... I'm going to try very hard to enjoy my last hour free of him..... and go eat something....... and stress over college more.... Good news is I have yet to get a headache today!! (ooh watch me get one just to spite me for saying that!) and... uh... still haven't done my homework....
