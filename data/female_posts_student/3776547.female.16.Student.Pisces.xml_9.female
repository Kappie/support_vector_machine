Who knows if it will ever happen thought because I was like mom if I pay for the bar-bell will you take me to get it done and she was like sure but if you can pay for your bar-bell that means you can pay for your car insurance. She was like and to do both of thoes you need money and to get money you need a job.  She was like so yeah I dont see you getting you bar-bell done!  I am so going to prove her wrong!  I will win!  Like I always do!
