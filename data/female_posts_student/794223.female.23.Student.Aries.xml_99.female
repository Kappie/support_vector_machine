Christian Cubans have some of the strongest faith I've ever seen, despite the oppression and restrictions they suffer.  I can definitively say that I learned more this past week in Cuba than the entire 5 months that I was there two years ago.  Although I was on a missionary trip, I really feel that  I  was the one whose faith was touched and further solidified by the very people we were sharing the gospel with.  They have so very little material wise, and yet they have everything that counts--a love for Christ that is rock-solid no matter what difficulties are thrown their way.  As I was driving back to my house today, I felt suddenly heartbroken.  I realized that I actually had the option of leaving Cuba and seeing the rest of my family; the Cubans that I've become so close to and who are so dear to my heart don't have that luxery.  At the Havana airport on the way back to Miami, I watched in horror and extreme sadness as hundreds of Cubans sobbed while waving goodbye to their family members who actually received the opportunity to board a plane to the States.  Cuban Americans are only allowed to apply for visas to visit family members in Cuba once every 3 years now, and some visas might not even be granted.  I could write a book about my trip, and I'll be talking more on here about it later.  I can't and won't discuss everything, but I can share just what an impact this second trip had, and probably will have, on my life.
