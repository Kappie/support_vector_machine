Its totally my mom, though. and...i really dont feel like explaining the whole conversation...but it basically ended with "go ahead and ask her, but just understand why we're a little concerned" sigh.  am i the only one in the world who would, having lived through the last year never seeing her enough, still love this girl? that cant be. Gosh, sometimes it feels like the whole world is pushing me away from her, whispering into my ear "you know, you should hate her. what has she done for you this last year?" you know what? shut up! shut up, mom. shut up, world. i know what im doing. you think id still be trying if it wasnt worth it to me? You think id waste all this time and energy on her if i didnt care...i mean, really care? Maybe i do! maybe its not that im stupid and i dont get it and im letting her take advantage of me... mabye she just really is busy all the time and doesnt have much time for getting together with any of her friends, let alone me. Sure she sees and talks to other friends and her boyfriend more than she sees and talk to me, but thats not because shes purposely avoiding me, its cause those are the people she happens to see a lot at school.   grrr... i hope she can go not only cause i want to spend time with her, but so i can spite my mother.  and i gotta wait till after confirmation to call her and ask her. out to dinner now.
