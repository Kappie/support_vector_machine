In the morning, Dave's dad gave us a tour of the Engineering Department, mostly the Electrical Engineering part. I learned about all the opportunites that RIT offers its Engineering majors. I also got to see a lot of really cool machines and equipment and talk to some of the professors. Even though I'm pretty sure Electrical Engineering is not for me, it was still very interesting and informative. I loved watching the people making the computer chips in the little contained rooms. After a fun lunch, i worked for a littlebit on my lists, but then went out to volleyball.
