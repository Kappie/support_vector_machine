I'd say it was something more, like frightening, if it weren't the most unlikely of events that it would succeed.  But indeed, it is somewhat frightening that the President has so little respect for the Constitution that he would be willing to throw his support behind this type of amendment.  It is simply beneath the dignity and beyond the scope of the document to be worthy of inclusion alongside those amendments dealing with freedom or speech or religion or equal protection.  And he is totally trashing the supposedly conservative concept of federalism, which should let each state decide how they want to handle this subject.    The cynic in me realizes that Bush knows this doesn't have a chance in hell of actually becoming an amendment to the Constitution.  He is merely trying to appease his base now that it looks like the election in November might actually be close.  But it does seem to be a rather petty and fickle thing to command the the President's attention when it should be focused elsewhere.  I am very disappointed indeed.  I'm not saying he should come out in support of gay marriage, but he should stick to conservative principles of keeping the federal government's nose out of stuff that it doesn't belong in.  I am reminded today why, though I share so many of their views, I do not call myself a Republican.  If I did, today I would indeed be ashamed to carry that title.
