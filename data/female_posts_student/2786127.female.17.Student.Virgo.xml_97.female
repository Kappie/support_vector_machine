It freaks me out, i'm never home around 12 so this is new to me.  I keep thinking i hear my cell phone in the other room to find out that its all in my head. I think i'm going crazy, i'm hearing things. And i'm still creeped out about or phone cord getting cut...thats just messed up.   I want to go to college. I want away!!!!! AWAY DAMMIT. I don't want to go to high school anymore. Bah. I have registration in two days.  I need to make a new life.  Jon called me ugly tonight.  *sigh*. whatevs. Its not like i have good self esteem to ruin anyways.   But back to this college thing. I was hanging out with Staci and Ashley the other day and we got to talking about if we all went to the University of Washington. We could all get an apartment together and decorate it...we could have cats and live near Seattle where we could flea market shop and play at the aquarium. God that sounds like the life right now...i'd give anything to be in that fantasy.  my life seems so worthless right now. I'm just...bored. Things will pick up i expect when volleyball starts up.  The only thing good about this summer was Genie...without her i would have had absolutly no fun at all. I heart Genie.
