I hope it turns out half as good as any of Sarah's stories.   This morning, I woke up at 8:03 and got ready for work. It was pretty painless. Got done at 12:00 today. The kids are really cute. The third-fifth grade kind of think they know it all though. Oh well! I can't judge because i'm too young.  I got home and ate my subway sandwich. I talk to Sarah and she tells me she can't come over because of the storm. I have been depressed since. I haven't been this low in so long. I felt the world was going to end. I'll get off that subject now. Basically, we fought, and we overcame it. Everyone should be proud of us because it was a hell of a rough fight.   I don't really have anything else to say! Hope everyone has a good day tomorrow. Summer time is pretty great
