Online shopping is gradually depreciating in my mind. Too many hassles and I am just getting more and more untrusting because of it. GAH! I want my book... It's just not right to take a book from an academic freak. *wailing*  Okay, so I paid for standard delivery... yet the person mailed it under media mail of US Postal Office. Grr... cheap, slow delivery. Grrrrrrrrrrrrr! Media mail is like around one dollar. I paid almost four dollars for shipping...  *breathing in and out... relatively calmly... will speak with professor*
