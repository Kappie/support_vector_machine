I'm more near-sighted and since my eyes are not aligned on the same "planes," I'm getting some prism in my glasses. They're really cute. I'll post a picture when they're in. Oh, speaking of pictures, this is the easiest way for people to get that I donated 21 inches to  urlLink locks of love  is by picture, so here it is:    So don't mind the little pink me; it's the computer's fault, I'm sure. ;) But yeah, that's my new do and I like it. ^_^  So after the appointment, I delayed lunch for the sake of Mardell's Music Madness sale today only, all CD's ten dollars or less was totally worth it. I totally  stocked up  on great groups like  urlLink Skillet  (of course) and Barlow Girl. Now all I lack of the former group (my favoritism band of all time) is their  Ardent Worship  album. But hey, that's cool. All this earthly stuff ain't going with me when I die anyway. ^_^  Then I came home and vacuumed the upstairs (after my devotional, of course) while listening to Skillet's  Alien Youth  then I did my workout to  Collide  WITH that nice track  Open Wounds  (it's a bonus one when the album was re-released) ;). It was nice; I lifted weights vigorously, jogged for a bit, used the pull-up bar, put weights on my arms and legs and did WHOLE bunch of kicks and punches. It felt GREAT! HOOAH! Praise God! Man, do I sound like a girl who took karate/was in ROTC or what? -_-` Oh well. God made me the way that I am for a reason, which He'll reveal in His time. As said in Falling Up's song:   Father, healer deliver me from broken love Stay hear, closer let me hear your voice of love  Um... right now, I'm listening to Barlow Girl -- Never Alone. [^_^] Mom left for grad school and Dad came home from work. In a bit we're gonna fix some burgers. Oh yeah, I did have lunch, don't worry. I was able to hold on until we got home; I split some nice split pea soup with my mom. :)  So tonight I'll probably try to catch up with some friends whom I met from  urlLink church  camp and whoever else happens to be online. IMing is more convenient than the phone; I can talk to multiple people at once. "Efficient, too," says the engineer's daughter side of me. Well, it is, considering that we have cable internet. *shrugs* So that's about all going on here.   I'm kinda stressing about my first of three summer reading assignments a little now since I haven't had the chance to read much of it today. I mean, until I get my new prescription, I can't stand to read but for 15-20 minutes without feeling seriously carsick. And that's being perfectly still, sitting in a chair in my own home with plenty of  urlLink light   with  my glasses on. Go figure. ;P I'll be okay; the LORD is with me, as always.  Had a slight "identity crisis" earlier. I opened my CD case to pull out  Collide  and in the left pocket was the Skillet CD in all of its punk silver and black sleekness and in the right pocket was the Powerpuff Girls in all of their pink, puffy, girlie splendor. I gasped in revelation; this was me! I am tough like a true cadet (with the body build to prove it) and extremely soft like a squishy, sensitive, sentimental ballerina. *shrugs* God must have a variety in store for my life; never a dull moment, I guess. :) For now, I'm just a mad mix of opposites.
