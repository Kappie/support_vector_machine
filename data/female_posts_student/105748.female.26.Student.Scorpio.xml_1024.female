Then thats easy but if you want to really play the part you might wanna rent a half size ninja sword, a ball and chain, and i guess grow your hair long till it reaches your @55.  Good luck with the killer costume.  Take pictures while your at it.  I would like to see a Brian in a skirt dont get me wrong I am just curious.
