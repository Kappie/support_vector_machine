Today, i meet my supervisor to see what i have to do? the first thing i have to do is to meet him every Tuesday at 2pm. I really want to say 'Thank you' to him cause if he makes me to see him earlier, I would die!! ha ha ha  So, my project start with reading as many papers as I can about GA and microarray.  OK... let go for it!!!
