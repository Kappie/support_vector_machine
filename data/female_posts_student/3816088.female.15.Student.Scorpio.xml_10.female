On Friday night I went over to Maegans house around 4:30 and got completly lost lol it was great fun and finally got there around 5. After I got there we had Wendys and went and swang on the playground like little kids!! It was so much fun! Then like later that night..I guess around like 10 or so Ben came over and we talked for a while and just hung out in his car (he has the BEST car ever!!..im soo jealous). Then soon after Chelsy came over and hung out with us too and we just goofed around for a little while and then went to bed so we could wake up early the next morning for.... Well we woke up at 8 to get ready for Hurricane Harbor!! We all three got ready fast so we could be ready by the time the guys got to Maegans house....So yeaAndy, Ben, Ryan, and Phamgot there around 9:30 and we finally left around like 10:30 maybe?? i dont know and we just hung out at Hurricane Harbor. The first ride we did was like this straight down one and I was soo freaked out but it ended up being so much fun!!! And then we did a few other rides and like always hung out in the lazy river and the wave pool. And we also played volleyball a lot and we all fought over Bens "ball" It wassoo muchfun! We all like rolled in the sand and got covered since we were still wetand stuff and then Ben and Chelsy burried me in the sand. lol It took me forever to get the sand off me! And I still have a whole bunch of sand in my swimsuit..its cRaZy!But it was still so much fun.. Then later on during the dayChelsy, Ben, and me all lost the others in the lazy river so we just went on our own rides and stuff and it started to get really really cold because the sun was like going down so we went to my locker and got my towel which wasnt all that big and me and Ben like made it so we would both fit... it was pretty funny watching us try but whatever. After all that and finding everyone again we went to Wendys for some dinner and stuff and then we just went home and good thing because I was sooo tired and still am so i am going to go to bed! Good night, sleep tight! heather
