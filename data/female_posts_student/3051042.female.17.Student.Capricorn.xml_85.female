From Ashley's Everything Book:   I have the choice of going up into his bed and at a sorry attempt to make him feel uncomfortable, or I can sit here and write. C'mon Ash, no regrets... Plus I think I'm still drunk. *Sigh* This is so hard for me. Go for it. (my heart is pounding)  Where are you Michelle?
