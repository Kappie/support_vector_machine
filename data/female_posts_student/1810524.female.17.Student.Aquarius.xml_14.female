(the coolness!:S)  today i hav to admit i hav been kinda.....how to put it nicely......moody! i hav rather alot on my mind to say the least! i dont think i can quite go in to most of it atm coz im still kinda hurtin...alot- briefly, i like sum1 alot- mi x , and now one of my close mates has started likin him, really really likin him alot n i think he likes her just as much. i no it doesnt sound much-  teenage girly problem ! but it really hurts,... really really hurts!  im kinda surprised im not used to it by now, coz wen i first started goin out with him a gd, almost best mate of mine tryed to break us up coz she liked him, later on in the ' relationship ' he tells me he really likes one of my other closest freinds! grrrr! but yet i still like him?! madness! i dont no wot it is about him,everyone likes him....he just makes you feel so special and wanted, just by tlkin to you! but is he the one for me?! lol we so should go on like  ricky lake  or sumit ' go ricky, go ricky! '....or not!  part of me's sayin  'he'll b better off with her, she's great'  and  'leave them to b happy together' ,  but then another part is sayin  'fight for him'  and  'dont just give up' , but i dunno, im confussed! well, im always confused but not im just completly cafuzzled! :S:S:S:S and on top of that i get my  gcse  results  2moz!  5yrs of school workin up to these n ill find it out soo soon!  but my other problems r bigger! i could go down the beach 2dy but they'll both b there n i really really dont wanna c anyone, i just dont feel like i can face seeing ppl! i just wouldnt no wot 2 say to anyone bout anythin-especially to her! last night, online she was turned 2 me and asked how i'd feel n wot id do if they got 2gether! my god! she new/no's how i feel about him, but as long as everyone else is happy! the sad thing is that was actually my outlook on things,  'if it'll make sum1 else happy! ' but y should i? nobody else does! i dunno wot 2 do or wot 2 say....grrrrrr! xxx
