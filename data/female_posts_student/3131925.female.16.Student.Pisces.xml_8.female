WQe ended up going to Cathrines and her and Mexican were watching the Wizard of Oz trippin out..funniest thing ever. Then we roamed around and went to Uncle Ray's and chilled there for awhile and Shantel tripped and left and me and Carlye went back to Jessie's and slept. The on Sat. I went with Adela to Main street. Interesting times. We walked everywhere, saw mean girls lol, and then went to the beach where we saw this couple in their 40's or so playing with dolls and taking pictures on the jetty lol..so yeah after that we left. Then later that night Carlye, Marie and Shantel called and wanted to chill so I packed my shit and went back over. We walked over to Jetty Surf Cafe and saw all the Strand guys there..KENNY TOTALLY CHECKED OUT CARLYE..it's casual lol. Then Matty came and got us some..ahem and we headed back to Shantel's haha. Then we went out and roamed around again until 10 and went back to Jessie's and chilled cause the cops were out everywhere. Then Ashley called and come and picked us up and started driving to some beach house on Hollywood Beach for a party..stole her moms car and only had a permit lol but she drove good so nothin happened. We showed up to the house and no one was there so we chilled and waited and talked..then Shantel got really sick so we left. Once we got to Jessie's Carlye decided to go look for Kenny so Marie and I chilled then went to sleep. Now I'm sittin here..tryin to remember as much as I can lol and I don't think I remembered it all...but yeah. But it sucked cause I didnt get to talk to Clint ONCE, kept missin is calls and he'd miss mine so I'm actually anxious to go to school on Monday. Back for some more drama.
