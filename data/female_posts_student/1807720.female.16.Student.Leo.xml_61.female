When I got to school and went and got some math help from my math teacher and there were like a couple of us in her room watching some examples.  Socail was pretty good, we all spend the time practicing math and there were other people practicing for the test as well so whatever I didn't get we helped each other out.  Then I had the math test.  Surprisingly I didn't think it went all that bad.  I mean I know that there were some questions that I didn't understand but there were also lots of questions that I totally understood.  I really hope I did good on that.  And well after interviews thurs my TA knew I had some issues with some of the teachers and then in CALM today I don't know how we got to the topic but then she actually told me all the stuff they talked about.  I only asked her to talk to my Chem teacher but I think she talked to my math teacher too.  She said that they said that I doubt myself alot and that sometimes I can do things but I think that I can't do them.  And then she said that they said that I am really hard on myself.  I guess now that I think about it I can be a kind of hard on myself at times, and I guess sometimes I do doubt myself.  I think my TA also mentioned something about structured reviews to like the math and the chem teacher.  I am hoping maybe the Chem teacher will like have a little more structure to her teaching and stuff now that well I think my TA told them that.  Well yestarday well pretty good.  Me and Travis did some stuff together.  We were going to go into his hot tub but then I decided not too because I didn't want to lie to my parents because I can't lie - I hate lying, and well I just knew if we did his parents might come home or something.  So I went over to his house and we played X-Box, GameCube, and Playstation for a couple hours.  Then we went to my house and I made him some lunch, actually a really huge lunch.  We has that spiral KD stuff and then we shared some pizza too.  Then I made us some hot chocolate.  It was really good actually, he said I was a good cook.  Then we played my N-64 and I kicked his ass.  LOL.  Then we talked for like a million hours.  Later that night I watched Joe Millionaire finale which was soooooo sad and happy, and like a million other emotions.  When I was trying to go to sleep I just started crying for about five minutues, but I can't even remember why I was crying.  I think it might have been that I was really stressed out about the math test, that could have been it.
