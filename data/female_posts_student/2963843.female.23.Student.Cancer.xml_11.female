Actually its because I'm late so I had to rush down the escalator.. hehe...  Something really embarrasing happened today. I was printing some stuff out in the lab.. As I still have not had my lunch, my stomach started growling! There were these 2 guys beside me and I heard one ask the other;"hey are you hungry? Wanna go eat something?" Then silence for a while n I heard some murmuring... Eeeks! Ah agony! the pain of embarrasement!!  Then I still had to stand right there and pretend that it wasn't me as the bloody printer is still not finished yet... I couldn't even dare look behind to see if they were pointing at me or what... Somehow I feel they were! Why? Why god? Why do these mah lu stuff always happen to me? N I was feeling so babelicious with my new haircut! Then this have to happen!  Saw this gal wearing one of those pink j-pop pleated short skirt today...  Singapore's been invaded by J-pop wannabes who all think they look like Jolin Tsai or Ayumi... Bright pink with bright green?? Big dangly pink earrings to go with that? eeks... yuck.. puke...   Nuff said... I'm going to study now for my investment test tomorrow.. See ya! =)
