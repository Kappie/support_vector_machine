       
      I will not walk on the water’s edge,  Below the pink mystic sky and the three glowing moons,  Nor will I walk in the water shore sludge,  Surrounded by enchanting dark forests of sadness and gloom.    But straight to the center is the place that I go  In a silver mercury lake of denseness and power,  And on the place I walk is a strong current flow  To send small rippling waves to the edge lining flowers.    In the hazy distance are shining purple mountains,  Planted in the thick water absorbing it’s shiny glaze  And within the glaring purple are many natural fountains  Making beautiful waterfalls in the hidden mysterious caves.    Sand-like glitter drifts from the sky,  Bringing the foreign smell from “the other side.”
