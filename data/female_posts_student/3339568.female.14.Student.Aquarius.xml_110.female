First song I'm teaching myself is Pete Murray - So Beautiful (mi fave song in the world) and I'm also attempting to learn Tim Hughes - Here I am to Worship, but I'm waiting for Mel to come back so she can help me with that once, because she supposdley has the higher, easier veriosn of it or something. Wow, I'm so excited. Last night I was all depresso and feeling apart from the Lord, so I just randomly thought, I'm gonna play the guitar! Yay. And I was practicing until like 11.00pm. hehe, its so fun, I think I'm doing it all wrong and everything, but it doesn't matter because I'm enjoying myself and feeling a bit happier!
