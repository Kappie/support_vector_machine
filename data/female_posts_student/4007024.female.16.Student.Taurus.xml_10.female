LOL. but the pie was totally awesome and we were just lazy and watched where the heart is while the guys complained b/c we were watching lifetime. i mean shit it's the woman's channel and we want to watch it. oh the other guy that was there was madison's cousin.. if you were wondering where the plural on guys came from. ;-)  so i get a call from judson ( yeah yeah... i'm a freaking taxi cab or something ) and he wants to go sulphur. i'm like okay b/c i figure judson knows where this chick lives. but uhh he thinks he does.. we have to ask directions like 3 times. and i being the unpatient one i am was like going off b/c i was driving around sulphur for like 30mins. and this isn't far into sulphur.. it's just maplewood so just imagine how many times i had to turn around. oh i was fuming.  i come home FINALLY and i'm about to take a nap then madison calls and says to come over so we can go get daquiri's before we go froggin and we are all meeting at her house... so oh course i jump out of the bed..! haha we all chill at mady's having a good time. and then we go froggin... and we didn't catch ANYTHING. the closest i got to a frog is when william put his hand on my leg and i got sewer shit on me.. and i didn't smell too peachy.  then we went to jack's and he was having a few people over so i get out telling people hey and they leave me but i don't care because amanda was there and she wanted me to stay anyways b/c she felt weird being the only barbe person there..and was happy i decided to stay. so i hung out with scott most of them time... and that's my little buddy. he's cool as shit. and amanda disappears so we go to find her.. and then me and amanda are off b/c she has to bring me to my car at madisons.  so that was my night. it was pretty fun and adventurous. :o) but next time i hope i catch a frog. or atleast get the chance to hop into the ditch.. there wasn't much out there.  good times. later.  PS yes i still haven't fallen asleep yet.. and i don't know how i'm not passed the hell out. but i'm going to go attempt to fall asleep... let's hope it works. byebye.
