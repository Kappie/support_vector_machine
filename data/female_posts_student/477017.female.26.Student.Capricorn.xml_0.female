Standing Still - Jewel  Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights  Try to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here  To the twilight  There's a dead end to my left  There's a burning bush to my right  You aren't in sight  You aren't in sight  Do you want me  Like I want you  Or am I standing still  Beneath a darkened sky  Or am I standing still  With the scenery flying by  Or am I standing still  Out of the corner of my eye  Was that you passing me by  Mothers on the stoop  Boys in souped-up coupes  On this hot summer night  Between fight and flight  Is the blind man's sight  And a choice that's right  I roll the window down  Feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town  Feel broken down
