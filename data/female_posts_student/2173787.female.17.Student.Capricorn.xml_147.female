It was nasty enough that I came home, transferred all of my bedding from my bed to the floor of my parent's bedroom and snuggled up to a marathon to TV watching and napping.  Unfortunately woke up feeling crappy with an exceptionally large load of homework left (which I still haven't done).  In an attempt to wake up I just downed a coke float consisting of a full can of diet Pepsi and 1/2 cup of ice cream and an extra can of diet Pepsi.  Now just feel sick.
