Erin was in it and so was David. Anway erin wanted me back home and we were hanging out.Further into my day. I decided to clean my room and now it smells like febreeze..Which doesn't smell too bad. But my room is clean and has a cotton candy theme. which is kind of cool.. I am still in my pajamas. Cuz I am cool.Pitt went to the water slides today..urgh jealous. And I cant find any good radio stations any more. i wrote a sexy comment on Taryn's blog. I hope she reads it.so far thats it. Besides that hannah took pics and has no money for doubles. I might send her some...cuz I want them now.
