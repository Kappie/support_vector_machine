Thats when i notice not only are there the 3 kids but some neighbor kids from next door have come over now there are like 8 lil kids runnin around and climbn trees its like a zoo of kids!!!!!then me and ashes thought it would be safe at school today but we saw raymon and had 2 run away more today than any day so far. Then i was walkin home and i was almost here when i look behind me and see raymon and ryan walkin a little ways behind me, so i casually walk behind a truck 2 block there sight till im home, i really really hope they were just casually walkin down the street, but they never passed my house i think they turned around and went back.haha k well i gotta go 2 work and hope nothin horrid happens while im gone haha, later days, peace out, rock on wateva, mandy
