Even though I still return to sch early in the morning for a remedial, I still managed to pay my frenz house a visit to pass him his hw... Watch my god bro perform during his NPCC promotion test... it kindda seem funny to me, but his expression when taking the test was so strict... so firm.... Nth much though, even though it is a saturdae... nv go out, nv go and play bball... whole person felt so weak and tired... hope to jus lie in bed and slack for the whole dae...
