We got there, and we were waiting for Dave in the parking lot and we were like, "Oh, is that Dave?" "No, that's just some old guy." This happened like three times, so finally Peter says something along the lines of, "there's a lot of old people, is there league bowling?" So, finally when Dave gets there we go in and check, and yes...there definitely is league bowling until 9:30, and it was only like, 7:30 so we decided to just go see a movie. We ended up seeing Scary Movie 3. It actually wasn't bad. Pretty funny. I guess it probably would have sucked had I not seen The Ring and Signs but since I had, it was good.   And really, that was my evening. Not too eventful, but still good. :)  Tomorrow...hm hm hm, what am I doing tomorrow? I have a driving lesson at 11:00, then I think I'm going out with Bryan for a while, then I think I'm going downtown to visit my brother/go out to dinner down there. I'm excited for that. I LOVE going to dinner downtown. I feel so...I don't know. It's just fun.   Anyway, I'm not even going to say I'm going to bed because I know I'm not. I know I'll stay up for like...four more hours. Most likely talking to people online. Every time I try to leave, someone new comes on and IM's me, or someone I really want to talk to comes on...  Ahhh! Oh well. I'll TRY to get a decent night of sleep.
