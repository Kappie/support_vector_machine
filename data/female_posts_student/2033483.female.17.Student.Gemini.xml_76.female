"My Band"-Eminem This song, like every other song Eminem has rapped on, has gotten annoying real fast.  It was good the first three times I heard it and now can be recycled.   3. "I want it that way"-The Backstreet Boys  I'll admit I went through the teeny-bopper stage and really liked them, not as much as NSYNC but I liked them.   But one thing I never understood was that song.  What way does he want it?  Obviously, that way, but what way is that? 4. “Intuition”-Jewel  That song ruined her career 5.“Where is the Love?”-Black Eyed Peas  It's a good song with a good message but I think they’d find the love if they stop playing that song constantly on the radio and making people angry when they’re on their way to school! 6. Anything by Outkast after it's fifth play 7. Watching Jessica Simpson sing anything is enough to make you hate her dispite the fact that she doesn't know the difference between a buffalo and a chicken wing.
