When we say go away... we mean go away... God that bar was sketchy now looking back... but at the time it seemed like a really really good idea.  Go figure, we were drunk.  No Doubt : It's My Life This song brings me full circle back to Carteret.  Plen and I were obsessed with this song.  Of course it was playing at his house that fateful Halloween Night... myabe that's why I don't like it nearly as much anymore.  Hoobastank : The Reason The song I obsessed over after a certain ex called me to tell me about a certain current girlfriend for the first time... I kind of got a little bent out of shape.  Thank god I got over that fast.    Outkast : Roses Rob, better known as Yaley, singing this randomly throughout our Ensemble finals.  Baby Bash : Suga Suga Christmas shopping at Macy's... don't ask.  Okay that's enough for today Michelle Branch : Breathe Sadly, it reminds me of fat women trying on clothes far too small for them... oh it was so gross...  Five for Fighting : 100 years Driving home from HFStival and finally listening to the lyrics and deciding this was one of the most depressing songs EVER!  Cause guess what... I'M NOT 15 ANYMORE!  Howie Day : Perfect Time of Day Where to begin?  9:30 club and hearing him on the radio for the first time and being so very very proud.  It was about friggin time.
