Under my grandmother’s care and supervision, I saw life in a different kind of perspective hearing advices from my lola all the time about simplicity, strengthening one’s faith in God and being good. In addition to that kind of upbringing, my school where I’m in for almost 12 years now, has also molded me significantly into the kind of person that I am. It is an all-girls Catholic school that stresses really the values of simplicity, respect for human dignity, responsibility, compassion for others, and all the while, never failing to inculcate in us the importance of academic excellence. As I grew up, there were numerous instances where in I was made to choose between remaining the kind of person that I knew I was or conforming to what others think and believe for the sake of acceptance. I should say growing up was never easy. You get influences from different kinds of people and even those whom you admire. Sometimes their influences may not be that good at all. But despite all that, I also never sacrificed my values just for the sake of being accepted in a group. I saw to it all the time that my actions were always according to what I learned in school and at home and of course, what I for surely know is right. With regards to my studies, I have consistently placed myself in the honor list since elementary grade. But apart from my hard work to excel in my studies, I also never limit myself from doing just that. As much as possible, I really try to do the things that I love and I try to enhance these talents which I believe I possess. I believe talents are only enhanced once one commits herself to practice it every now and then. Whenever I get to have the luxury of time, I sing and I write. These two things are basically my passion. Through these, I get to express myself more creatively. And to enhance them even more, I take up voice lessons and also take the time to write every single day. In school, I am into my passion of reaching out to others through the Peer Facilitator’s Circle. By being a peer facilitator, there’s a bigger chance for me to get to interact with students in my high school. They come to me for some advice and at times for academic tutorials. But whenever I do my job as a PF, no matter how tiring things can get, the fulfillment I get from helping others is certainly incomparable. With all these and that I am involved in all through out my high school life, I could say that I am more than glad enough being where I stand right now. I know I am nearing towards the end of my secondary education. At least, for the last remaining months that I’m in my school, I want to make the most of my senior year. And I can say that at this point, I am experiencing the best moments of my life. What would probably count the most unforgettable experience I had this year is my grade 10 retreat. Within that one day and a half long experience, I was able to really get in touch with my inner self and take a closer look at my values. Personally, my relationships with my friends and my classmates were strengthened. I had a really great time bonding with my friends and sharing to them things they never once knew about me. This experience made us appreciate each other even more and has made me realize that I was right when I decided not to change anything about myself. After all, at this point in my life, I could say that I’ve finally found friends who could wholeheartedly accept me and love me for what I am. The parent-daughter encounter was also a very significant part of the package. But most of all, I had a very meaningful interaction with God. My faith and spirituality was further strengthened. And that, I think is the most important part of it all.
