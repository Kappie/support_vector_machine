I will let the public decide.   P.S. I'm right.   It all began with a rail gun........   --------------------------------------------  Tali : I'm going to buy a real camera   Frankie : I have no contacts in and at first glance that read I'm going to buy a rail gun. Don't know why   Tali : LOLThat'd be cool too   Frankie : Imagine the things you could do with one.   Tali : Ummmm...Frankie? What's a rail gun?   Frankie : Its a gun that shoots giant metal slugs out at speeds close to 4 times the speed of sound. It uses electromagnets to propel these slugs through a rail and out at amazing speeds   Tali : Holy fuck   Frankie : The cool thing is the amount of electricity used in propelling the slug usually causes it to turn into a giant ball of plasma. Very cool shit.   Tali : I need one   Frankie : Everyone needs one   Tali : Well, not everyone   Frankie : No no really...everyone...its like the same theory as in the cold war   Tali : No no. Everyone except the people I want to shoot   Frankie : see...thats why you shouldn't have WMD's   Tali : ROFL That makes no logical sense. Why in the Gods' names would I want my enemies to have the same weapon as me?   Frankie : You're like Iraq man. You're a loose cannon with no understanding of the ramifications.   Tali : Tactically speaking, I want them to have crappier versions of the same weapon.   Frankie : Nope...for the good of man kind its better to have everyone on equal settings.   Tali : No it's not. Then we just blow up each other equally thereby DESTROYING mankind. That's not good.I may not be an anthropologist but I know blowing each other up till we're all dead is not good.   Frankie : No seriously...for one it keeps people on the edge and from using the weapon in fear of retribution. it also is an amazing way to inspire development of new technologies. True...but look at history as an example. Look at how much money was dumped into R just based on the fact that we had to stay one ahead of the russions. Sadly enough fear is a great motivater.  Tali : It also is a dangerous balance cause one press of the button from them, then I'm going to have to press the button cause, well fuck, if I'm going to die then they are too, and BAM! no more mankind. And the Russians never had the same weapons as us. They had crappier versions of ours  Frankie : Nope...but we sure thought they did ;)  Tali : So my argument stands correct. Thank you  Frankie : No it doesnt. You're crazy  Tali : You just said so  Frankie : No...I said "we thought they did" which is equivilent to then having it.  Tali : Re read your log of this conversation and get back tome.The general public thought they did, our government knew they didn't hence them making better ones and allowing the soviet union to buy the cheap knock-offs. I still win  Frankie : Nope :: hits you in the arm ::  Tali : Yes, andI'm posting this conversation on my blog to prove my point  -----------------------------------------------------------  I'll let the readers decide who won (me!) .
