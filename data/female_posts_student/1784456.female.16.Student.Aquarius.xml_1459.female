Like the lack of careness *caring* yes, yes, whatever shut up! (Like there) But people don't seem to notice, the world's so cold. It's scary. Like the girls who are obsessed with themselves and their problems, and try and convince you that breaking their nail is worse than anything that could ever have happened to you. *bitter sounding* Well... I've had to put up with it enough, we all have. What about *the children!* No, what about the people who are dying because they don't have any food, that simple thing could save them. What about people who have been ill for their whole lives and are waiting to die? Oh, but you're right. Nails are important, aren't they? *i think too much*
