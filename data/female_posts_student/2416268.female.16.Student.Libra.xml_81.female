When does something become ridiculous? is it ridiculous that i am a huge Marilyn Monroe fan, that I am a big Audrey Hepburn fan or that i adore the fairies and am fasinated by witches?   to some it may be,  but to me it is not, i don't care what other see,  as I am happy being me!!!  ooooohh i framed my pictures today, they are now on my wall!! THANK YOU ALL FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, what i have done to deserve you lot is beyond me?!?!?!?!?!?!  love you  Nat
