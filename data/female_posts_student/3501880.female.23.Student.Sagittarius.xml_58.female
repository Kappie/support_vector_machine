What I have noticed for the past week or so are a number of large garbage sacks left along the side of the highway, spaced about two hundred feet apart from each other. It looks like there are dead bodies in carelessly stuffed inside. At first, I giggled at the absurdity of the idea, but now, I think there might actually BE dead bodies inside. And what a perfect disposal site. Who is really going to stop and see what the contents of these bags are? I imagine at some point the highway patrol might do something about it, but considered the large numbers of roadkill and abandoned cars along the side of the road, I don't think it would be in this fiscal year.
