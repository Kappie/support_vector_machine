One thing i decided is that i'm going to be at truce with my body..no more punishing my body..no more self-hate..I'm done with that chapter in my life..count ur blessings, not ur blemishes! I am proud to say i gave up my Eating Disorder last weekend! I didn't love myself..so i couldn't believe how others could love me..i didn't understand! It was amazing for me to believe Jesus gave his life for ME! I am His!
