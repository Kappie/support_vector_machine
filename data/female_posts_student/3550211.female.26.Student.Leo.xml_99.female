One of our required readings is a poem entitled, "Fire and Ice," which I would like to share with you. I hope it is as enjoyable to you, as it is to me.     Fire and Ice  --Robert Frost  Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To say that for destruction ice Is also great And would suffice.
