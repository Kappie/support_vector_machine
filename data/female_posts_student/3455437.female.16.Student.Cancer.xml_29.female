First paragraph:  Good afternoon Mrs Thompson and class,  Establishing a utopia would be an ideal solution to solving mankind’s problems.   We currently live in a world full of greed, apathy, hate, corruption and extreme inequality. As a result millions suffer. Suffer from being ignored by the rest of society. The capitalist way of living has failed, taking with it countless victims of poverty and neglect. It is therefore my belief a utopia should be established, mirrored from Thomas More’s novel “Utopia”.
