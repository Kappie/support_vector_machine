He asked me if I would sit with him because it would "make him so happy" so I did, and we talked mainly about Martha Stewart and government corruption.  Enjoyed my inaugural patron chat -- usually I hang out in the window serving.  Only three weeks to go.  Came back home, answered email, listened to TV and read/skimmed two novels.  Four to go tomorrow plus a library trip and dinner with Miki.    Got to get over my phone phobia.  Important call to make tomorrow :p  More to come...
