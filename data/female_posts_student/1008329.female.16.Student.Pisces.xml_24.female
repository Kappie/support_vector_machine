LLoYd, if you read this: CALL ME.  HuMm.."dOg". Yes, haven't talked to him since the beginning of break. Ha. What a laugh. LLoYd asked me why I even like him. I don't know really. I guess I see different things in people. Take BNP for example. I don't see anything now, and am surprised I ever saw something. But, at one point, I did. I think it was the chase that drew me in. Other (dumb) girls wanted him and he was going out at the time I wanted him. So his g/f thought he was doin' the *dirtydirty* and dumped him. I guess it's the feeling of: 'o0o does he like me? does he not?' I remember that feeling very well. It's now more 'can he hold my interest after he returns his?' -That is very important. I don't know about you, but I sometimes find myself bored with the current fling. Just sayin'...  Does it ever seem fake to you? Sometimes I feel like things that were important last week no longer are worth mentioning. I easily let things go b/c I don't care enough to keep them going. Especially drama.   I realize that there are always going to be boneheads in life. You can't escape them, and it scares me. There's people always thinking in their ignorant ways and it infuriates me that I can't change their mind.   It also kind of frightens me that people might actually read this. A lot of people are surprised when they really get to know me. I guess I give the wrong impression..?? I've been told it's more of a goody-goody, sweetie-airhead thing, or psycho. I don't think people see me as a person that thinks...unless..they do. Hah. That makes sense.   xxx000  -crackELhead-
