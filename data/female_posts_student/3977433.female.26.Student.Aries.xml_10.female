"Out of sight, out of mind" works for this situation quite well I believe.       I can't wait around for someone to find worth in me. I know I'm worth something, maybe just not to you.  One day I'll find that girl that wants to make me happy too. That doesn't do things to make me feel this way. ..... one day.      If you can't understand even remotely where I'm coming from, then it wasn't meant to be.       Reading now for the night.
