I have to smile when I consider his conviction on certain issues and his apathy to others.  Greed, Capitalism, Politics, Religion, and of course the every advancing world of Technology.  It seems at times that he is passionate about the most fragile of subjects, at all times.  Recently they passed a “Public Smoking Ban” in Waco and he freaked out.  Ranted about his Civil Liberties and I agreed with him –and not for the first time.  Now, he is boycotting any restaurant that will not allow smoking.  I commend him for standing up for what he believes in, it’s more than most would do.  Tonight we were talking about a rather big court case gone awry.  Matt is strictly against pirating –music, movies, you name it, if its pirated he hates it!  I have never seen any problems with people burning CD’s and he has.  It has always been an issue that we had to agree to disagree on until tonight.  When getting into the finer points of the effects of pirating, I think I have to take his side on this one.  He explained it like this: “For everything we purchase we are casting a vote.  If we buy a Metallica CD new from Hastings we are voting for their continued career.”  I understood but still he wasn’t getting through to me.  After a long discussion I came to the realization that Pirating is socially depleting.  Every pirated CD is a stolen item, which makes the new ones worth less.    In the end he was right and I wrong.  He should revel in his victory on this issue, it doesn’t happen very often!    Which coincidentally got me thinking I have always been interest in ethical issues.  What constitutes “unethical” these days?  Ethics is a personal decision and should be one made while taking into consideration the rights and laws of the world –both written and unwritten, spoken and unspoken.    For me, Religion and law dictate my morals and ethics, then on personal views.  This is not always so for everyone. I guess there is no real answer to the question: “What constitutes unethical?”  Dictionary.com defines unethical as: 1: not conforming to approved standards of social or professional behavior. 2: not adhering to ethical or moral principles.  If unethical is not conforming to standards, then who set’s those standards?  Is it the right of the government in this country to tell each person what they should believe and how to live their lives. If so then I jump on the boat and sail out to never-never land with Henry David Thoreau… but I digress, if I live in a country of freedom of thought then Thoreau is for the birds.  Then I wonder if that is the case then how is dictionary.com possibly right about what unethical is?  ~Kristyn
