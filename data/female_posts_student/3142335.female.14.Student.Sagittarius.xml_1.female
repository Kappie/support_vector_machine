Ok normal people just aren't that happy on this week....I love you girl!! No one like you!! Well today has come to be an over-all good day..I mean I thought that it was great and then it got mediocre and then it went waaaay uphill again...so yeah it was good.....OMG did you know that people think that Brittany Crosby and I look alike??? Hmm I thought that was intresting!! We're the next Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen!!! Aha I think it's funny...I was lookin in a magazine and saw them and I was like hey there's me and Brittany,mama, look there we are..aha just a funny moment but yeah some people just weren't in a good mood today.....And I mean maybe it's just me but I kept feelin like people were so mad at me and so I kinda just got depressed or liek there was something that they thought about me and wouldn't say anything about it and that kinda got annoying and I just wanted to go home but by 5th period when Mrs.Anderson called me "Sweetcheeks" in the middle of class I was just like ok never say that in a large class!!! B/c we were in there with a different class so that we wouldn't miss out any of the Romeo and Juliet stuff (Oh darn!!) But yeah and so now Colby calls me Sweetcheeks everytime that he sees me and I'm just like uggggh!!! But hey it's Colby so it's ok....He's already convinced me that I', stupid so who cares what he says aha....This past weekend Adam and I went down to the river and it was soooo much fun!!! Gah was it fun!!  But yeah I'm goin to eat now talk later!! Byebye!!!!
