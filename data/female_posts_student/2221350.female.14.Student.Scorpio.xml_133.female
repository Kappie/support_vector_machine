It is by far the best and most intriguing book I've laid eyes on since "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance". If you're a woman, you must read it, if you blindly follow the Christian bible, you must must read it, if you enjoy a good story, you must read it.   I would sit here and explain the whole story, but that would take forever. The main point is is that it's amazing what the church has done to cover the truth of history. The mission of the main characters is to find the holy grail, supposedly the cup or "vessel" that held Jesus christ's blood. BUT WAIT! A vessel.. Couldn't a vessel be something other than a cup? A person, perhaps? Jesus Christ was a mortal being, he lived a normal life until his crucifixion. He was married and had children with Mary Magdalene. This is the theory the book is based on. It said that Constantine and the catholic church rewrote the bible in an attempt to make Jesus more like a celestial being than a human religious leader. Over 80 accounts of Jesus' teachings were considered to be put in what people today consider "the way", but only a few, including those of Jesus' closest followers or disciples, made it in. in an attempt to further cover up the truth, they made Mary Magdalene out to be a prostitute. of course, this is not the whole book, it's 750 pages of the best book ever. all I can say is, I knew the bible was a load of wholly misinterpreted crap, but I didn't realize it was THAT BIG of a load of wholly misinterpreted crap! read it, read it, read it.  my grandmother in texas got out of the hospital friday night. she sounds like she's doing fine, but my dad doesn't know when i'll be able to come over. I am seriously losing my mind now. between devon's shit, momma's drinking, mammaw's bitching, and never having a second of peace, i'm ready to kill someone.   i'm going to see HP with Lauren, Devon, and tiffany tomorrow. I'm sure I'll love it. Plus I've got the OK that tiff can spend the night, and she's always tons of fun.  last night my mother and my neighbor were yammering about alcohol. For someone my age, I've got quite an opinion about a good drink. Like my biggest thing is American beer. It's piss! Watered down piss! As my Canadian bloggie buddies may know, a good Canadian beer is the best and there's no comparison between that and some crappy football game Budweiser baloney. My step dad was Canadian and he's the one who introduced me to.. I can't remember the brand name.. Was it molson? Anyways, don't touch that bud, it's nasty crap.  of course, if I have a choice, J neat is the only way to go.  I hope I'm not an alcoholic. I live in the biggest addiction family I know of, our main vices being gambling and drinking. I positively adore gambling, drinking is pretty nice, and I refuse to try drugs for fear of getting hooked. My position on drugs is about as uncool as it gets. I say don't try it, don't do it, stop it. You may as well just slap a D.A.R.E. sticker on my forehead. When you've had someone as close as your mother involved with that kind of thing, it seems much less silly.  there is a bingo dobber on the desk in the office, and my sister just put pink circles all over my arm. I am so sick of Devon, I could punch her. But she got lucky, because by the time I scrub this ink off my arm, I'll be too tired to kill her.  I'm looking for a really great book to read next, any suggestions?
