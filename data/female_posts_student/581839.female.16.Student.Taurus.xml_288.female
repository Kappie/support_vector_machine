And although the A grade student's expressions for all things great occasionally make a detour through "cool" and "awesome", there's just one word that sums up pretty much anything from Boot Camp rations to ice cream.... "amazing".   We take a look at how Stu perceives day-to-day items and activities.    On parsnips  "They're amazing."    On baked beans on toast  "Its amazing - it's like a standard issue meal."    On designer Christian Lacroix  "Who's Christian Lacroix? Is he amazing?"    On skiing  "It's the most amazing thing."    On sleeping  "I had an amaaaazing sleep last night."    On a task that involved the housemates plummeting into a trough of fish guts  "This is an amazing task."    On completing an obstacle course comprising a fishy tunnel, a manure trough and a balance beam in a bed of stinging nettles  "That was amazing."    On being given an ice cream machine by Big Brother  "Wow! That's amazing!"    On discovering that the ice cream machine dispenses strawberry, Smarties or chocolate ice cream  "Seriously??!!! SERIOUSLY??!!!!!! Woah! That's amazing."    On the procedure for erecting miniature boats in bottles  "That's amazing, that is."    On the basic rations provided for the Boot Camp task  "We eat amazingly in here - even this is something I wouldn't dream of having at Uni."    On the prospect of winning Big Brother  "I'd just feel even more amazing."      We'll have some of what he's having...  Here's to you here's to me best of friends we'll always be if we ever disagree (one finger in front of mouth) (whole hand in front of mouth) here's to me  september 13th = la calle doce day
