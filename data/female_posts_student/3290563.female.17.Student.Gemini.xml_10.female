Have you ever had those days where someone says or does something to make your heart literally hurt and your stomach drop? I hate it how my ex can make me feel like that whenever he's around me. I thought, that maybe, when I was finally able to get away from him, things would get better, but they're just steadily getting worse with each passing day. There's only so much verbal abuse you can take, before it finally starts sinking into your head, your body...your soul. It's like you're a sponge, soaking up all the anger that he spills. But what happens when you can't soak up any more?   That scar on my stomach is almost gone now, and I'm glad too. It was embarrassing. I didn't wear a bikini last year during summer because of it. I'm just...I have that feeling in my stomach again when I think about it. Meh, this is a shitty update, but I don't really give a fuck.  Much love
