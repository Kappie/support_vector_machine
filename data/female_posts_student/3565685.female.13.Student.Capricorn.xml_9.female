You just feel after that that you wanting to leave him and you want him to get out of your life.After that happens then you realised what happens.But after the break up you will change to be more positive in life and have a better guy than him a better one who is caring and more understanding for you.Someday when you can't tell a guy that you like him you feel upset.But when you havetold him and he says he love you too and you became so happy to be until one day he left you and then you understand that he was just playing with your feelings like what everybody think it would happen.       Sometimes being too sincere is not so right cause he may take advantage of you or even makes your day worser than ever and leave you.A sincere guy would keep the girl happy as she could be and never left her without any good reasons.So girls to find a boy you just have to be patient and find the right one before your day came to a worse end.So beware before it happens.This is just my opinion and my own day that happen before in my life.So its up to you....my friend you have taken my advice have succeed.So you can still tell that person how much you love them but just don't take it their sweet words or else you will be so unhappy at the end...Be not too sincere and be understanding to succeed...Good Luck and All The Best To All
