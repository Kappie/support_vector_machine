So Summit and all the streets and intersections around us are blocked off by police. Yet, our school remains completely open. Yup, they officially do not care about us. I was watching the police sneaking around in 4th period, Ms.B's class is on the first floor directly in front of Summit so I had the perfect view. Two officers were standing out in the middle of the street talking and I swear, this is word for word what they said.  "So, officers are moving in on Summit?" "Yeah." "Is the suspect still in the building?" "We don't know." "Shouldn't the school across the street be on lockdown too?" "No, it's only Hale."  God, that makes me feel loved. We just got news that we may end up on lockdown soon to though. Looking out the window here I can see all the local news stations setting up camp in the faculty parking lot. Goody.
