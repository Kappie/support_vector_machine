I dunno what is up with me adn andre he still isnt really wanting to talk to me cos of something I didn't do well I dont think I did anyway. He is too moody one minute he is all yay life is awesome go GOD and all this then he is like fuck I hate this shit I just wanna die. it is quite annoying but we all still love him because that is who he is. i can live with it, sumtimes, mum doesnt know why I even talk to him on MSN cos we always end up arguing.  Um I guess that is really about it apart from feelinglike shit I guess life is pretty good. Well three-day or mayb fourday weekend ahead yay. Peace
