So if I get the chance again, I'll know it isn't that bad. I really think God did something in me, because I didn't look nervous (so I hear.) I asked Mary if I could not wear shoes, and she said not to. At the last minute, I decided it would be better if I did, but I wasn't wearing them because I don't like wearing shoes when I'm sitting down (I really don't like them in general,) so when she told me to go up there, I forgot them. I think it was for the best though. I didn't want to wear them anyway. While I was speaking, my tongue got tied and I made a "pleh" sound to get it straightened out... People laughed. I got so many people coming up to me afterwards telling me that I did so good, which made me feel really good about it. Blair came up to me and said she teared up a little, which I was glad to hear, because I didn't think that my testimonial could make anyone feel anything. Anyway, enough about that. After High Pointe, Zane asked me if I was going to BCS to play "volleyball," and I said yes, and smiled very big, but I don't think he noticed. It was really a party for his birthday that was Friday. He was surprised, and all dressed and ready to play. It was Shanna's idea to get him a guitar, which was suuuch a good idea. The church bought it, and a lot of people signed the case, but I didn't get to. Maybe sometime this week. I really wish Zane didn't have to leave, he is such a great Christian guy. I know plenty of Christian guys, but not all that many that have a heart that reflects so much of God. He leaves next Sunday :\ Tomorrow (well today) I am going to the church again to film the Girls' retreat commercial. It's going to be good, we are using the Six-Flags commercial music. Ahh this is long, and I want to talk to Jose, and go to bed at the same time, so I'm off.
