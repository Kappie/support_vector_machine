I found out that now you can post pictures to your blog if you download a specific program, and I'll be all about that once I get home.  Yay for making the blog more exciting.  And, if you didn't notice, now you can also add comments.  Not that anyone has comments, but, well, if you do, feel free.  But if they're nasty I'll delete them. :)  So, I haven't tried to be deep or meaningful on my blog in a long, long time.  That needs to be remedied.  Today I was actually reflecting on the past year (I had to fill out a yearly progress report for my NSF fellowship), and I realized how much I've grown up since last year at this time.  I know I've commented before that whoever says you're grown up at 18 is full of crap, but it's worth revisiting.  I mean, last June, I never would have imagined that I'd be where I am right now.  In terms of academics, personal life, everything.  I finally am starting to figure out what I want to do with myself academically, I passed prelims, I have new friends (including girls!), I've done lots and lots of traveling, etc.  And of course there was the drinking until I puked thing.  Lots and lots of lessons learned. So, at the end of the day, do I feel like I'm a better person?  Well, maybe not, but I think I now have the potential to be a better person.   And you can take that as you will.  :)
