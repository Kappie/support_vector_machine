I actually know a young girl who has her life planned out to a much greater extent and she has for quite some time apparently. I just have a list of qualities I am looking for in a wife, a general idea of what I want to do for a career, the names, gender and birth order of my 4 children.  Actually I have three of the names picked out(the boys') and a name suggestion for a daughter but I will leave that one up to my wife.  My only real desire is that it stay with the Gaelic theme I have.  Woohoo!  I love my heritage.  Well I mean the nations I am from, not necessarily my individual ancestors.  Anyways, if you see any honest Baptist girls who love the Lord and have vampire fangs, give me a ring.  Or tell them to go to BJU.  All in all, the moral of the story is "It is not bad to have a plan."  Don't procrastinate.  Illegal narcotics are bad.  Buckle up.
