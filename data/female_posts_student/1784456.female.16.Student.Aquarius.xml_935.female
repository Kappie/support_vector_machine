Oh, and I don't care about posting their e-mail addy cause they're being sad and using the website form to type nonsense in. Get a blog, then you can type nonsense on that instead! (Like me) Hehe, I just sent an e-mail to them saying 'stop using my website form. bugger off.' Hehe, I can block them too! I WANT MY PAGE BACK! :'( Poor old lil me! Oh, we gave Jon a present and he was very scared. I don't think he'll blow it up though! *sob sob*
