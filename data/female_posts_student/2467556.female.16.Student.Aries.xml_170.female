Fireworks show was alright, except for the part with flaming particles (not kidding, totally serious) falling onto the audience's heads.  A few fell on my mom and one went down her pants and burned a hole in her shorts.  Also, a piece of one of the fireworks apparently landed in her chair also.  After the fireworks show, i went over to Brittany's house for what was supposed to be our big Vincent Lecavalier party because his replay on Leno was supposed to be that night.  How about not.  So we watched the outtakes and other stuff on the 2nd cd of the Miracle dvd and we watched Britt's Vincent Lecavalier slideshow that she made herself.  That slideshow was awesome!!!!  Just as great if not better than the Stanley Cup slideshow.  Then at about 1:30am or so, we decided to watch Miracle.  Of course, watching this took FOREVER, because me and Britt kept on pausing and rewinding at parts we liked.  We also had a competition of who's new fave Miracle character (Me = Silky, Britt = Johnson) was "in focus" in the camera more.  Silky so won, hehe britt.  Britt said that "muffled" shots didn't count....lol whatever the hell that meant.  Anyways we had alot of fun watching the movie and laughing and making stupid jokes/comments.  hehe "My Miracle soundtrack makes me want to kick some Commie butt..." good times.  Then the next day i had to get up super early because my mom was picking me up to go to the Independence Day parade because my brother, Dillon, was in it.  4 hrs of sleep baby!!!    After the parade, me and my family went out to brunch with our other family friends.  It would've been great if i hadn't been assigned to babysitting duty at the restaurant and my mom wasn't being such a bitch about everything.  Thankfully my dad bailed me out and let me drive his car home early after i had finished my meal.    Then, after doing my AcDec reading, i was so bored i decided to go to WalMart.  I looked around WalMart, checked on cd prices, etc etc....i looked for a cheap Harry Potter poster but the one with Danny looking really hott....but i couldn't find the one i wanted.  Then i came home after going to sonic and went all over the net looking for cheap posters.  I finally remembered where i got my Ferri Bueller's Day Off poster really cheap and i found my HP poster at the place called www.stage-fright.com!!!  only $17!!!!  Everyone should go to that site, they have really cool stuff there.  Anyways, i didn't buy it yet because i decided that i would buy my MIRACLE POSTER first since at AllPosters.com, they were having a free shipping and handling weekend.  So i got my Miracle poster for $20!!!  yaaaay!!!  i've already got a space planned for it.    After that, i drove my brothers to blockbuster, came home, ate dinner aaaaaaand here we are.  Since i have only had 4 hrs of sleep, i'm going to go now....and my mom is being retarded and trying to read over my shoulder, so i need to go.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
