Usually I'll wake at my normal getting up time of 6:15am; or over these past few weekends I simply haven't had time for a lie in. So it was a promising start to the weekend.  Can't say I've actually achieved that much today. Just been floating around. My housemate who's moving out, went home today so it's just me in the house this evening.  Mum rang earlier this evening asking me if I could get to Stratford earlier tomorrow. She said she was feeling a little vulnerable and ganged-up on by Ann, which didn't suprise me much. She asked me to get there for 10:00am, certainly earlier than I'd planned! Oh well, we'll just have to see what time I wriggle out of bed at tomorrow morning.
