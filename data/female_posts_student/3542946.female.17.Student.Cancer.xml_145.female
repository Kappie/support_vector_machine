Everybody who reads it leave a message. We are all winners in our own special ways. except for srug userts they are not winners. Had agood time at the party Polly, i hope you did too. Claire is very sorry about not cleaning up. Vanessa is very hurt about not being invited. Evan had a good time but he got drunk. Word!
