Then we went to claires and we bought little giraffe's and these best friend necklaces that are cheerleaders. They're pink and they're like amazing. I'm the "F" score. So then we went to get pizza. We were upstairs at Scotto's and we were sitting at this bench and i'm like laurel throw a piece of cheese over the railing. It hit this kid right on the head and then like bounced off it was amazing. So then we went to go get ice cream and we saw this old guy with a cane that had a horse head on it and it was all like fancy and he had a long beard and a black Indiana Jones-style hat with two red feathers. He was so cool! we stalked him and called him Texas Johnson (like Indiana Jones only not). The indiana jones movies are about him when he was young. And he lives in a mansion and he also lives in the sahara, cuz he's cool like that. Yeah so i looked away for like two seconds and he was gone. I'm a disgrace to stalkerdom. Yeah so then me and laurel were waiting for my mum to show up and we went on those little kid things that bounce up and down. That damn ice cream truck wouldn't work. Psht. Then i had this temporary addiction to those claw machines. It was bad. But then we left and Laurel lent me The Bell Jar, so I can finish it. That was basicly it. Yeah.
