I didn't think so, but I figured best to ask you. You know a ton more than I do.   My reply:   Interesting...well some do and some don't. It depends on what kind of Goth they are and their personality. To me, death is just another adventure waiting for you after life...except a much more pleasant if you lived your life well. Anyways, about the different types of Goths; you have the mopy Goths who are sitting around waiting to die or else speeding up death because well...according to them "life sucks", they would agree. "Death Rockers" the original Goths are...well you could almost call them punks digused as Goths because that's what goth branched from, they might agree depending on their personality. The perky Goths (probably me), the Glitter Goths...the list goes on...and those ones "live life to the fullest" (a cliche, *cringe*) and would not agree. Vampyre Goths...yeah they'd agree with that statement, and then you have "Manson's little followers" who would also agree with that statement...but Manson isn't Goth! OMG I'm going to stop there, I could go on and on...   In summary: NO, N-O, nope...and so forth.
