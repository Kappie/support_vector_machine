The girl..hmmm... well..she is not strong enough to put me in a full so half of my body is in a full and the other in a pre...yeah ok..duh..I am going to fall....but we finally hit is so I was happy! Anyways more important then that I was the first one finished when we ran today...I added more weight to everything today...so I am really happy about that! But my jumps still kinda suck...gain muscle takes a way from flexabilty so i seriously need to strech..and i need to learn the Fight Song...i feel so lost when we do that...and i hate yelling...I guess i am not 100% cheerleader! Now i am sore as all hell.... So on with the non cheer life...I went to the Branding Iron last night...which could be why i was so sore today..dancing all night...but i saw these really cute guys and then they came and daned with us..at the end of the night me and my friend... went to go talk to them and they were gone...sucked...but we are goign back on monday so i hope they will be there! I met some guy there from myspace...umm he got there like 10 45 and it closed at 11...so we saw eachother talked for about 3 seconds and then....we left...o well no love match there...ha ha  So update on the boy..hmm..i dunno when this feeling will ever go away...this love shit...i am tired of missing him...but i dunno what else to do...we talked and i was happy to hear from him...but i still miss him...I dunno...hopefully i come to some solid conclusion!...SOON!!! well until another time....
