She hasn't got the right.  She has to have tangible proof before she can accuse you of plagerism.  You know you wrote that paper, and so do I, and I'll be damned if you get a C for a paper as good as that one.  Fuck her feelings, Josh, this is not only about your grade, but also about your integrity and dignity, and if nothing else, those are the things you have got to stand up for.  Be assertive, Josh, tell her what you feel.  Tell her you're insulted, that you're pissed, that you demand a better grade.  If she doesn't give you one, take it to the administration.  I'll go with you.  Abby will go with you.  We'll both go with you.  But you absolutely  have  to talk to her about it.  Abby backs me up on this one Josh.  Everyone knows your right but her, and she's the only one who doesn't believe it.  Stand up for yourself, Josh.  She'll just keep running over you if you don't.  I don't give a shit what she thinks; you're an awesome writer, and I won't have her discouraging that anymore.  Josh, this is a very important issue.  This kind of stuff goes on your record that goes to your next english teacher.  I'm serious, Josh.  You've got to take control of this situation.  Now get your ass into that classroom tomorrow, and tell her exactly what you want from, and be forceful.  Not disrespectful, but assertive enough to get what you want.  Josh, you're one of the most gifted writers I've ever seen, and I won't let her think otherwise, and neither should you.  Please Josh, if not for yourself, then for mine and Abby's sake, please talk to Ms. Calhoun tomorrow.  The longer you wait the harder it will be.  Call me on my cell if you need me.  I should be up to all hours of the night.  See you tomorrow.
