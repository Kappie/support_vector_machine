Maybe except for Rupert Boneham. Yeehaw!   Last night before I went to bed, Geets hubby sms-ed me. She made me so happy. She wished me sweet dreams and casted a  Patronus  spell to keep the dementors away from me. I told her to be careful and not fall off the broomstick while dating with Harry above the Forbidden Forest otherwise it would mean trouble if they fell by the Whomping Willow. Geets said she'd rather be kissing Harry while Fawkes shed its feathers on them. Man I love Geets...  Gabriel and I are working on  Project Pia . Actually it's quite silly, it's supposed to keep us motivated to  pia  for our pre-prelims, prelims and o levels. Amesie poo has a countdown thingy on her blog to remind her of  The Big Day . I think that's really cool and useful, but since she already has one on her site, I don't think it's necessary for me to apply for one.  Yesterday as I was watching the show on Channel 8 at 7 in the evening, the little girl asked an incredibly meaningful question -  What is life ? And it really got me thinking. I personally feel that life is full of surprises and challenges. Life is also about enjoyment and being happy. Yes, although there are times whereby we get depressed and all, but I believe that nothing beats having your friends and family around you. It is also essential to be true to yourself. It's not worth living a life of deceit and hypocrisy. Well, that's what  I  feel about life. What about you?
