I've done some thinking about what I said in my last entry about "considering sex with josh" and I'm kicking myself in the ass for it. Taking my values into consideration, I really wouldn't want to have sex with someone that I'm having a "fling" with and lives in North Carolina. Infact, on a walk to Unimart with Anna we talked about sex and marriage. We want to wait, but homie, I don't know If I can do it =( I mean, I want to, but what if there's to much pressure, or I just don't want to wait. What if I don't ever get married? I'll be a virgin for life? Ouch! In the car on the way home from getting groceries I was thinking about it (yeah, I think about sex a lot, so deal with it). And if the situation came with me and my baby, would I have sex with him? I mean, I know it's right to wait, but what if that's what he wants, I wouldn't mind. Argh, like, I know I should wait, but I want it to be special, and I think with him, it would be. But what if that's not right? Will I go to hell? Will he? Well, I don't think so, but I wanna know! What if I terribly regret it when it's through. How could I regret it? He's amazing, and I have so much love for him! And the real question is...Why am I concerned now, I'm not even dating him. We've only kissed a couple times, and I'm not sure if he just wants to be "fuck buddies". Gosh, Maybe I'll worry about this later, I mean, it's only 1:14 in the afternoon. I'm not sure if I'll even see him tonight...I hope so
