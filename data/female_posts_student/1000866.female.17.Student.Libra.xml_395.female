It kind of amazes me...and I guess worries me that I've gotten So good at hiding things like when I'm upset. Even from Chris and he's my best friend and even from my mom and I tell her a heck of a lot. I don't know. I guess that just kind of scares me. I don't think hiding the fact that I'm upset is really good. It all bottles up and then I just end up really really upset. Oh well. I don't care. I'm sure I'm just tired.
