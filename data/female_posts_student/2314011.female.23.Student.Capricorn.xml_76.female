The four-hour power session went smoothly, even though it was a bit rough getting back into the rhythm of taking notes for Contracts.  Yikes!  Statute of Frauds, indeed.  One day, many removed from this one, I may explain the rule to you.  The Criminal Law class, however, looks promising indeed.  We love criminals!  But only the ones we read about in textbooks.  Actual ones aren't our friends.  Unless they are.  How's that for legal maneuvering for you?  I have a new nickname:  Nothing But Trouble.  I don't understand why I have this new designation, but I'll take it, own it and be proud of it just the same.  Don't even try to stop me.  Suppose it's a good thing I'm already a fan of the Pink song.  I'm harassing, too, but we won't get into that; trying to change that perception of myself, and all.    So now the day's down to reading for tomorrow, which is just more Criminal Law stuff, none of which I have to brief...Yah!  And that's always a good place to be; especially before 3 or 4 or 10!
