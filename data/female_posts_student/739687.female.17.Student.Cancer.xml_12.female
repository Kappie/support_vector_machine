No more useless worrying about everything. Life happens, and I'm sick of trying to mold it into the image I've created in my perfectionistic mind. So there ya go! That's just how it goes! I also want to concentrate more on writing, because for several years, it's the one thing I've been missing. I want to start chasing all the dreams I'd left behind when I got caught up in the hype of trying to be someone that I just wasn't. From now on, I'm going to concentrate on being myself. I just want to go back to being happy all the time...ok, well, how about  most  of the time, alright? I tell myself that I'm going to do that all the time, but I really mean it now. There's just so much that I've left behind...and I need to go back and pick up where I left off. Get rid of all your conceptions and judgements about me now, because they aren't going to do you any good.  Wow...enough of all that...I'm out!
