The SNL skit that parodied that "letting the days go by"  where David Byrne says, "and you may ask yourself, why such a big suit?"  It's really funny.              Anyhow, I'm busy in a good way today, not about to be buried in work, but  doing a lot of things, keeping me off crack and off the  streets.              I have an insured parcel at the post office... I don't know who it's  from, but oooh... how exciting! I'm hoping it's a CD I ordered, but we'll  see I suppose.               I was up until 1:30 this morning.... bad news when you're waking up at  5. But I feel mostly okay, as long as I don't think about it. I  spent a goodly part of the weekend fighting off a sinus infection, so the  sudafed and the excedrin gave me the jitters, making it difficult to  sleep. But I won. My sinuses feel fresh as a daisy, thank you.  I set a new Heather Sneeze Record yesterday: 18 consecutive sneezes! It  was ready for a nap when I was done.... Okay, back to work I go.
