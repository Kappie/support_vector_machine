I just need to work on it a lot so I might acctually look descent when I do it. Then from 6-7 we have like a break and we always just run over to Target and get a bite to eat and then head back for jazz class. Well me and Mariah really dont like jazz and it was also raining like cRaZy!! By the time we all got into Target (Kelly, Mariah and I) we were all drenched so we sat and ate and talked and kelly then called her mom to come and get her to take her to the dance placebecause she didnt feel like running in the rain again. So thenMariah and Imade the decision to SKIP BABY!! We are such rebels! We had it all planned out even though it didnt work that good.  See the Lord does cruel things sometimes. Hes a great guy but sometimes I get the idea that he doesnt feel the same about me. Well it got time to run back to the dance place so we didnt get caught and of course it was raining the hardest it had the whole night. Like you couldnt even see the whole parking lot. It was terrible!!! SoMariah and Iwere like we are runny like heck to the closest cover and then we will take a break and do it again!! Well see when rain is coming at you its really hard to run. So yea we thought we were going all fast when we were like crawling. It was pathetic! We just decided it would probably just be easier to walk. So we walked over to the verizon store and stood under the little cover for like a second and then we started again and we hid over by where half price books is so our teacher wouldnt see us. lol ThenTHANK GODMariahs brother got there and we sat in the car until my mom got there and I guess she couldnt see me because it was so dark because she didnt ask me one question of why I was dripping wet. My feet were litterally swimming in my shoes because since I have clima cools and since they arent supposed to be taken in water because they have ventsthat will let water in like -that i was swimming. It was terrible. My pants were stuck to me my shirt was like soo wet it was stretching and I could just feel the cold water dripping down my back from my hair. You know how everyone says no good deed goes unpunnished well that should be changed to no goodlie goes unpunnished. But despite all that and all the rain I am still sooooooo glad I skipped jazz!! NO ORBITZ OR DOUBLES FOR ME!!!! YAYA! Mariah and Me have successfully skipped twice now!! Once for Teams and now once for Jazz!!  Well I am going to go because me and my brother are jammin out to Awesome God....lol dont ask please! i love you miss rebel heather!!! jk
