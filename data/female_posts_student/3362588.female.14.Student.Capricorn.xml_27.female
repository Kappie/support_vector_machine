Buahahahaha. Then I'm gonna say, "I love you as much as I love country music!!" Country is, for your information, from the devil. buahahaha.   I went to Quincy today. To buy a swimsuit. But there wasn't any. So instead I bought a cool skirt instead. It's blue and knee high and kinda tight around the hips (joking) and has waves on it. Nifty Stuff. I was gonna buy a coo black shirt too, but mom thought it was too tight. For mom, anything is tight that doesn't make you look like your wearing a potato sack. j/k.  GIthinks some blondes are hot.... and he's sending me a pic of him in a beany minus a shirt. We also talked about what makes a person hot and how to avoid a farmers tan. Don't ask. It's not what it sounds. I do not need mentle help (lena....).   Clarisa Is A Jerk. She Is Very Annoying. She thinks I like Brian. Ha Ha. Weirdo.....  lol  sooo  yeah, uh.... notin' mucho more to say.  Signing off - Jak the stud magnet
