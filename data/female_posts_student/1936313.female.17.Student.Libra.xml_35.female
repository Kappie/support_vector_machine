Michael bear came into being shortly (a week or two?.. or maybe only days..) after the accident. Megs and I went out to West Ed and being the dilligent impulse buyer that I am, we passed Build a Bear and decided to do something in honor of Michael. I'm such a child, I know... Teddybears are magic guys, they make anything better.  We picked out a purple tipped bear referred to as Nikki's Bear, as proceeds from the sale of those bears went to fund children's cancer research and treatment programs. We proceeded to dress our furry friend in a tux and top hat, because Michael was our Prince Charming... and it just seemd to suit the bear right. So.. thus was born our dear Michael bear....         I swear I'll write a new poem at sometime this year.. but here as well is the poem I wrote around the same time as taking Michael bear home with me. I thought I'd lost the poem.. hah... and then Dad revealed just how much of my writing he's been saving on me.       En MÃ©moire      For a loved one lost this night, A new one now takes to flight. Cherished memories taking form, To care for our hearts...forlorn..  Precious to those who held him near Who watched and cared without a fear Flowers abundant from his hand, A smile to light the entire land.. A dashing prince to bring those smiles.. He'd do anything for us... across the miles..  Now all thats left is our cuddly bear To show him how much we truly care Brought to life this twenty-seventh Our message shall travel with it to heaven...  Our love for him will travel now To float in the stars and rest in the clouds Goodnight to a friend...oh so dear.. So far away.. but oh so near    I've got a week to start dragging all my strength together... let's hope I'm successful... otherwise things tend to go sour.  I apologize in advanced for my odd and probably cold behaviour for the coming week.
