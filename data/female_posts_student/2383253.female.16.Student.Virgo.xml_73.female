Of course, I'll have you share more of the details with me once you get back. ;)  And Insha, tonight we must hang out or something before you leave tomorrow! I'm gonna miss you so much. :( I know you'll play  beautifully  once again in Portugal, especially with your daily 2-hour practicing sessions. Don't worry, it'll ALL pay off eventually.  As for myself, I've been extremely bored in the doldrums of summer. August will be here on Sunday, and I've really yet to accomplish anything much. I started doing community service work at this place called Hannah's House in Balboa Park. Basically, it's a place where separated, two-house families can have supervised visitation for the parties who don't have custody of the child(ren), or so that an exchange can take place from one parent to another. They also have several themed rooms filled with books, toys, videos, arts and crafts, and animals to amuse the children. Essentially, it's a place to put the child at ease and prevent trauma, since most of the children come from a broken home or abuse situations. The past two days I've been vacuuming and cleaning there, bagging donated Starbucks pastries, and making phone calls to both parties as a reminder to exchange or visit their children. It's quite a hassle, actually. Sometimes I can't get ahold of the parent, or they start giving me an attitude about the price or what the other parent is up to. Today I had to call up parents and inform them that a Gay Pride Parade is taking place tomorrow on the same street and that they can't park there. Do you know how many people scoffed at that? People have no respect, I swear.  Other than that, not much else is going on. I should be doing my summer homework, but I've hardly even cracked open the books. I haven't socialized with anyone in a really, really long time. There's just no one around anymore. Now I'm almost looking forward to the beginning of school....bah.
