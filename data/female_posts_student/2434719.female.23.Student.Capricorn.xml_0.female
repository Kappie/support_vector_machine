O magazine's theme this month is happiness, and i took a quiz and i am officially happy. :).  tell it to the cheetah.  all i want is a nice day with  a jean skirt and flip flops with the sun shining on my shoulders..... that's ALL i want right now.  and it wouldn't hurt to have a million dollars thrown in there.
