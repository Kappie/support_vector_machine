"These Walls"  Something missing Left behind Search in circles Every time I try I've been here before I've seen you before I can't escape walking down these halls Hard to find a place where there are no walls And no lines begging me to cross Only straight ahead better move along Like Clockwork I commit the crime I pretend to be everything they like I've been here before I've seen you before And I trade everything for this And I trade everything for this Why do I read the writing on the wall Why do I read the writing on the wall I won't lose my place in line I've been here too long and I've spent too much time I won't lose my place in line I've been here too long and I've spent too much time     dont have a great weekend because i wont                                       later days                                               MEH
