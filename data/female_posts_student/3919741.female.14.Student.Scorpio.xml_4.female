And all day she kept pointing at me and going "I'm not touching you...I'm not touching you." you know like they do one that commercial. And then latly shes been whineing about how she wants to talk to Demarco, her ex-b/f,  so bad but shes to scared to pick up the phone and call that fucker. and then she'll go " trishy you should call him for me" but i won't because I know if I do she'll get mad at me.  School is starting soon, and each day I get more and more scared about it. I mean because I'm going to be going to a big high school were I know no one. and im just going to be just a small freshman. :( well thats it for now talk to you all later
