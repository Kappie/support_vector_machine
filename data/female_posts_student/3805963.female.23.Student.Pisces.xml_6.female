I vowed to myself right then that no one should fear such things and that when my companions and I are ready we will smite every creature that sets foot on that ground with an evil thought in his mind. But, now we must get stronger. We head past the castle to a giant fortress where large dark humanoids breed their young and teach them the ways of all the dark gods and goddesses. I feel sorry for the young ones that my compainions slaughter yet I know what they will grow up to be and am grateful that I am saving them the tragedy of serving one that is not Brell. This takes us a long time, yet we are successfull. Kretais, Ziggur and I agree that we should contact the Wayfarers Brotherhood to see if they have any use of our abilities. I am ashamed that it has been so long since we have asked them, yet there are many evils in the world and we have been busy.  Kretais then called upon his powers and made us all as light as a feather. Before I knew it I was levitating. I had no idea it was so much fun to fly in the sky. I could see the world and the mountains, the slight sunset on the eastern horizon. I felt that with one long hard bellow I could cure the world simply by shouting my prayers. All the evil creatures would turn thier heads and listen immediatly putting down thier swords and maces and taking up a book of Brell. I was ashamed at my naivite yet it was a wonderous and emignatic feeling of power. Though I must admit that I like being little and so close to the ground. Ziggur and Kretais miss out on so much that I see from my small stature. Such as did you know ants and other small bugs have the cutest little faces? Everyone should bend down and take a look, it might bother you to step on such small creatures.  Brell has blessed me yet again with new spells and abilities that I will put to good use. I picked these up on my way to the Wayfarers Camp where they told me of a great evil in one of the many dungeons on Norrath. It seems that the evil is starting to creep slowly into Lesser Faydark and they thought that these creatures are just right for me, Ziggur and a few other companions to smite. I agreed and contacted Ziggur, his beastlord friend, another paladin and a ranger to help. We went through the dungeon smoothly and with ease. These creatures were of no match for Brell's powers in our group. We take care of this in less than an hour and are on our way again to the Kastanor Castle eager to beat this evil once and for all.  Akcron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!
