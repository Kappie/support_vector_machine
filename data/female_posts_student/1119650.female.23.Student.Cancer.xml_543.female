That always seem to make me smile, like reading over a long email from someone or the anticipation of drinks and a night on the town with my girlies, a long hot bath with some good tunes crankin' and only candles to light the room, maybe even just snuggling with my kitties.  I dunno I feel so at peace right now its amazing.  My life has the potential to go in a million different directions and instead of being stressed like I used to get over "not knowing" I'm excited, just going with whatever happens to see what comes next.  For the last 3 years I've been under this dilluded impression that I was supposed to be responsible and have this big office job that's gonna mean something.  I have wasted so much time skipping out on adventures and being young because I thought I was being responsible.  To hell with that.  The only person I have any responsiblity to is myself so without further ado I'm gonna go out and be happy already.  So, if you're along for the ride, cool if not, I hope our paths cross again someday and best of luck to you in the interim.
