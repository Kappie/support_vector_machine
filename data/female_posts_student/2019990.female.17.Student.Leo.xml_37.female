I wonder if my body didn't just go into an automatic sleep mode after being awake for too long.  I do however remember counting how many times Abner changed positions, and dropped his pencil during Spanish class.  The final count was changing positions 35, and dropping pencil 15.  He is a hyperactive child.  I almost feel like I was drugged this afternoon.  It took Wonder Woman about 20 mins to wake me up to go to Great Spoons.  We had a good time.  I got new shoes!  They're so pretty. They're black and strappy and sparkly, and little bit expensive, but they're comfortable, and will last a long time.  Abner and Paco actually called me to go to Great Spoons tonight too, but I was already gone.  I was really surprised that they called though.  Next weekend I'm going with them to the opening of Troy though, so that should be interesting.  But how can a movie that has both Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt in it be bad?   So on the way home tonight I was thinking, and next year is really going to suck.  Wonder Woman, Lola, Abner,Uma, and alot of other school time friends are going to be gone.  It's going to be a really hard year too.  I'm taking first semester: English, Social, Advanced Bio, Pre-calc, Web Page, possibly Discrete and Finite if I can do it as an independent study class, and Journalism.  Second semester I'm taking all but discrete and Web Page, those will change to science seminar, and a technology aid, or technology independent study, whatever they want to call it.  I'm going to be very stressed next year.  I'll have even less hair.  score!     In other news the results of the student council elections were in today, I was beaten by my one competitior.  I can't understand.  both of my friends said they voted for me.  I obviously didn't do much to appease the masses.  Oh well they'll be fine without my leader ship.  I'm a born follower.     I think today was a be mean to people I like day.  In english this morning one who will remain nameless was reading the article Lola and I had published in the great Spoons paper which was against tanning.  He is an avid tanner, and he was making fun of us when I was right there in the class.  I'm not deaf, and it's not like he was discrete about it either.  Then in social another one who shall remain nameless counted the um's in Leila's presentation about the Beatles.  I wanted to hit him, it's hard enough to give a presentation without someone pointing out what you did wrong after you were done, to the whole class.  Kids these days have no respect.  But I'm exhausted.  I'm heading to bed.
