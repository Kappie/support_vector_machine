At the game, my friends and I we wondering if we would be allowed to oob, because it's the opposite of boo, so it has to be something positive right?  It didn't really seem to catch on however.  Yesterday my teachers kindly game me lots of homework for the weekend, I was pumped.  I only have about three hours of math, and 2 of chemistry which I totally have time for.  Although I did get to go shopping for a little while yesterday, I went to Target, and I got a new purse, quite exciting, it has venice on it!  I also found sweettarts lip gloss, that was exciting.  I think I may go  make myself some lunch though, I haven't really eaten yet today.  (The excitement level rose 3 points)
