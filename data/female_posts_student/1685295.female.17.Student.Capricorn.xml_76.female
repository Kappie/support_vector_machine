Anyway couldn't update yesterday cause I came home late and had to go to sleep fast or else people would start yelling at me. The funny thing is that I actually fell alseep at around three in the morning.  During the time when I was staring at the ceiling, I decided to make a web comic (I've made this decision several times). Probably won't do it cause I am too lazy but, I can hope.  Anyway it's true Deadinside does smile, not often, but I've seen it. The  urlLink About The Staff  page is updated; check it out.
