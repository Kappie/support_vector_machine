I got schooled by all of the girls there sooo badly, cause they had all been playing for probably like a thousand years, but it was all good. I met some new people. I roomed with these two girls, Rachael and Katie. They were both awesome, and so sweet. I miss them now. I can't sleep now, becuase it feels weird to be sleeping in my own bed. How strange. At camp, the sessions were long and tiring, but they were really worth it. Everyday we would wake up at 7 am. and eat breakfast, than at 8:45, we would be out on the field and be ready to play. In the mornings, we would always go to different stations which we on the fields, which all had different kinds of techniques there. It was cool. We did a hell of a lot of sprinting there. It wasn't too bad though. Then at 11:30, the session would be over and everyone would flock to the lunch buffet. Then at 1:45, again we would have to be out on the field, but at these times we would play with our "teams". Well of course I didn't have a team, so I was with just a bunch of other random girls. It was all good though. We would then come off of the fields at 4:30, and then again go eat. At 6:45 we would all go on the field again and play games against each other until it got dark out, so that would be usually about 8:30 pm. It was a helluva busy day! Every night me and my girls were beat! It was a lot of fun though and it was worth it. Wednesday night was a ton of fun, becuase we had the talent show. We did American Idol and I got up in fron of a bunch of people and like sang "I've Got A Lovely Bunch of Coconuts." Everyone was laughing. Then on Tuesday night, we didn't go out at night again, becuase it was pouring so badly. So we all watched Finding Nemo. Everyday it did rain though, we did play in it, so on Tuesday in the afternoon and on Wednesday at night, we played in the pouring rain. I was completely soaked and uncomfortable. Our room reeked of wet clothing and mildew and mold and nasty crap like that! It was terrible. Next time I go to camp, I know now to bring a lot more stuff, like Gatorade and like snacks and stuff to do. All we did in our room was sat around and played cards, becuase that's all we had! It was still fun though. I bought this awesome sweatshirt from the store. I got it all muddy though on Thursday, the day I finally came home, because we had to play on the Rugby field, which was a total swamp, because of all of the rain! It was pretty funny though, everyone was sliding and falling. It's weird, it's my first night home and in my own bed, and I can't sleep at all. I thought the minute my head touched the pillow, I would be out like a lightbulb, but that was completely opposite. I can't get comfortable. Well, peace out!
