I think that guy Oliver Alvarez went to the same church with me when I was younger. If I am not mistaken I think he lives somewhere in Moonwalk close to our church.  Ask him if he knows my uncle, Onie Hernaez (Leslie's dad).  I took the liberty to check out the teacher's profile and I remembered his face. Oh well, what a small world.  I just thought I'd tell you. :)
