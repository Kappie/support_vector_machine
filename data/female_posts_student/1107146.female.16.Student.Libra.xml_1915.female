I'll get a pair of socks and, like, the next day, there'll be a hole.   Ok, so I've actually never had a hole in the sock.  I just thought a story like that would be appropriate for such a subject.    Ok, so I'm going to turn strange on you guys again and become really perky.    Hey y'all.  (Yes, Linds.  Y'all).  Wanna come on out to my schools production of "Rumors?"  It's really neato mosquito man.  And the makeup is spectacular!  It would make me so darn happy if we could sit in the back cursing MC for taking my part!  Yeh, after reading that, it's not very perky.  Oh well.  I tried.  Sorta.  Kinda.  Ok, not so much.  Yeh, not really at all.
