She is doing it at her aunts house cuz her sunts house is right on the river and she has a nice big yard. At her aunts house they have this big concrete pavilion thingy and it was caked with dirt .. like an inch thick. There were leaves and a bunch of sticks and shit stuck to it. So Danielle and i sat there for an hour and a half scraping dirt off the concrete thing. CHER IS ON THE RADIO!!!! sorry she just came on and i had to add that .. lol .. :) ! anywayz .. now after an hour and a half of cleaning for her party danielle said she might cancel it. I was kinda mad but thats ok ... its her party she can cry about it if she wants to. So afterwards we went to Bens house cuz we had nothing to do and we didnt want to go home yet. When we got there ben told us that he was expecting chip over so they could go to the mall ... so i was going to leave before she got there. But we ended up staying and going to the mall with ben and chip. It wasnt bad .. i had fun. Then we went to amys where we met amy, nate, alvin, and shaina. Amy suggested we camp out so we called jeremy and camped out in his back yard. It was unexpectedly very comfortable and i really didnt want to get up this morning, but i didnt have much of a choice. Amy and nate started throwing pillows and blankets on me so i couldnt move or breathe. them they proceeded to beat me ... lol but they always do that so its ok. Everyone except amy and ben are going to see spiderman 2 today and i really want to go but i cant cuz i dont have any money, but i am pretty sure i am getting my belly button peirced today so that should be fun! im excited!! oh well i think i wrote enough, im going to go shower cuz im a stinky kid. I'll write another post after i get my belly pierced.
