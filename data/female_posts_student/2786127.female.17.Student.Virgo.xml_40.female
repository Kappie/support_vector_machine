I went to church and got there as they were closing service. hmm. embarrasing.   I need a shower. I put mayonaise in my hair yesterday so  it would be all shinetastic and pretty today, and i took a shower and now it looks rat-tastic so i'm takeing another one. Nope, you can't talk me out of it. To bad, i'm going to anyways.
