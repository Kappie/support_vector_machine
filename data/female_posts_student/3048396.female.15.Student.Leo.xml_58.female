I don't even get to see him on his birthday. *sigh* I really wish I could...But tonight is the last night for Bible School and I really have to be there. Its been 39 days since I've seen him tho. Eh...kills me. On top of it all I've been super emotional last night and all day today...I just cry at random times *sigh* I don't know. Its weird. *sigh* First song I heard today was The Reason. That helps even more. Eh. I hate crying...but it feels good too I guess. Otherwise today has been very uneventful. I woke up late again...sat on the computer for awhile...Kim came over...I packed for this weekend and thats about all. *sigh* I get to see Kait tomorrow...and Im excited but I wish I could see Ross too. Who knows when he'll get his present. Probably July. LoL. Oh well...*sigh* I just miss him...and feel soo young...hes 16 now...and Im sadly still 14. Oh well its not as bad as my parents my Dad is like 5 years older than my Mom...so yeah. Well the Bible School program is tonight...Might be a disastor. These kids have a VERY short attention span....might not work out to well...but yeah. It'll be cute as normal. So yeah....I guess not much more is goin on....I just miss my Ross......
