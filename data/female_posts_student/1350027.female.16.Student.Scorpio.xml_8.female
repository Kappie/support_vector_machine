Simple quotes, poetry or lyrics are simply imprinted in our brains and the words are replayed again and again in our minds whether consciously or unconsciously.  For a whole week, everytime I've finally found some peace and quiet, Atreyu's song starts playing in my head. The lyrics thumping and the vocals, strained and screaming, echoes. Over and over.  "Look how pretty she is when she falls down And there's no beauty in bleeding mascara Lips are quivering like a whitering rose She's back again."  I wonder what it all means. Hopefully it fades away soon. I'm starting to get rather annoyed. Not that it's not a good song, because it really IS a good song but mainly because it's just starting to be rather .... naggish.  ANYWAYS, Paul's parents are back. He has no car thanks to the stupid trailer who decided to squash it like how we would crush a Coke can before recycling it. I am pretty much stuck at home as no one wants to teach me how to drive and I'm too lazy to go for the Undang thingamajig and the fact that I can only legally take my license in November.  Any functions happening over the next 2 months I'd probably have to skip unless someone's kind enough to drive all the way to Subang pick me up and send me home by 1AM, latest.  I did some shopping yesterday. Instead of buying Seamonkeys, I ended up with two wifebeaters and .. a silly belt. I misread the price and paid more than I was willing to. :(  I have to make cheesecake today.
