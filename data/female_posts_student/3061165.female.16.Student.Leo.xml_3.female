Guess it's easier to understand when I've seen the movie. =)  The story is really marvelous! The pathetic movie is like a summary of the whole book! Missed out many events like Griffindor winning the Quidditch matches when Harry got the Firebolt OR how biased Severus Snape was OR the little history about the history of Moony(Lupin), Wormtail(Peter), Padfoot(Sirius) and Prongs(James) with Snape in their schooldays and many others! Geez... And just when is He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named gonna die? Haiz! I hope the Harry Potter movie 3 will release some extended versions in VCD/DVD. Hope the 4th movie(if there is one) will not take away such many details. Oh, heard from Kheng Wei it's gonna be three hours long! Hope so! ^^  Browse through this   urlLink website   on Harry Potter! It provides lots of imformation regarding many things such as the Characters, Spells, Creatures and so on. I dont think it's an official webbie though... but it's nice. Also, check out this   urlLink website  . Do be careful of *Spoilers* though. It contains all de mistakes in the Harry Potter 3 movie! Goofs! ^^ Haiz.. Still couldn't find anyone for the 4th and 5th books.. Geez. Oh btw, if anyone wishes his/her webbie to appear under my links, feel free to  urlLink email me . Gotta find something else to do now~ Signing off! ^^  P.S: The quotes posted today are all from Harry Potter books! ;)    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban   Quote: There are all kinds of courage. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much as to stand up to our friends. Quote 2: If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals. Quote 3: Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where it keeps its brain.
