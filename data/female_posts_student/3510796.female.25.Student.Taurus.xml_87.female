There's so much inherent pessimism in being a White Sox fan, knowing your team is, has been, and always will be second-class in this town.  It's something to be embraced rather than fought, really.  It builds character.  Right.  So now, I owe Grey dinner at  urlLink The Parthenon ... assuming that she ever has any free time to make it out to Chicago for dinner.  She has her weekends full till about November, I think, and weekdays, well, that's just a lost cause.  This could very well be one bet I never have to pay out.  Saturday night, I went out to see my friend's boyfriend's band play a bar gig.  They had a great hard rock sound and did a cover of Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love" that sounded incredible, with a drum solo that blew everyone away.  Unfortunately, they were too loud for the venue, it was pouring rain off and on, and the town they were playing in was having their fireworks that night.  So, put that all together, and the end result is a less-than-spectacular turnout.  Staying the whole time though, were two guys in their late 40s wearing NASCAR apparel, rocking out like there was no tomorrow.  (We were out in the eight-one-five, where the downstate twang starts showing up and people think stock car racing is half-sport, half-religion, when in fact it's neither.)  But I told Dan (the aforementioned boyfriend of my friend) that hey, if Cheap Trick can make it big in Japan, there's no reason Desert Plenty can't get their start with the NASCAR crowd.  Sometimes, you find your fans in unexpected places.  Matt's decided that a summer job is just too much to handle.  So that means I've only got 2 weeks left here of having 3 mornings out of the week to myself.  After that, an already-uncomfortable situation will get a little extra boost.  I can't wait to get out of here.  Job listings this week, well, pretty much suck.  But I can't afford to be picky at this point - I'll take just about whatever I can find that will allow me to be self-sufficient.  Speaking of job listings, Grey and I were talking on the phone last night, both dead tired and slap-happy, her from the birthday party, me from a classic 14-hour shift at work.  Now, I'm willing to cut her some slack because we were both sleepy at the time and laughing like a couple of freshly baked stoners, but she insists that if you drop a letter off at the post office on Sunday night (when it's closed,) and the destination is fairly local, that letter will reach its recipient by Monday afternoon, when the mail is delivered.  I say the earliest it gets there is Tuesday, because that letter's not getting touched until Monday morning at the earliest, it's not arriving in a mailbox till Tuesday.  She says she will prove it to me by mailing a letter to herself next Sunday night.  I think that if she was any more full of beans, she'd qualify for farm subsidies.  Especially since I'm working with the metro Chicago postal service, the same people who took 3 letters from me on Thursday, all addressed to the same place, and only one of them showed up on Saturday.  Monday afternoon, my ass.
