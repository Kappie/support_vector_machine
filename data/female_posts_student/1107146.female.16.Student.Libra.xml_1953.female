Completely changing the subject from Disney characters and Finland, though, I went to a Lyle Lovett concert for those of you who know who he is.  Pretty good, but he didn't do enough of his old stuff.  And Francine wasn't there.  She's getting old.  Oh, well.  Good concert anyway.  See yall later.  I'm going to bed.
