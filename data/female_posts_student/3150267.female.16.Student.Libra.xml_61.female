He's always there... forever my dayima. haha. he use to say tt he has a glass heart n is always easily broken, but now i can see tt he's stronger now... still remember he "carelessly" tore the first letter i wrote to him... n the first present, a keychain together a tiao zhan shu... :D haha.. so hope u luv the present i bought for u n MUZ not Give it to OTHER ppl ok?!!! haha... anyway, thanks a lot chun qing ke ai, yue guan chao ji mei shao nv. (happy wif tt name? if not later go add somemore)          today had english lesson in the morning n after tt went out wif wm, gary n wc. when i was at orchard be4 meeting them,i saw a lot of nhrians whom i noe n r gary's classmates. haha. such a coincidence. like wat frenz always do, we hang out n walked towards taka to meet rk n his fren. she kinda looks like michelle (yh's gal) hehe. kinda cute. i think yh will agree wif me totally rite. haha. going out wif them always need to ponder lotsa things. first, where to eat. this question is a tough one coz all of us had a hard time deciding. (mostly bc all of us r very easy going.. hehe...) so we somehow corked up a pathway in cineleisure, next to pastamania. needless to say, we went into pastamania. enjoyed our food n off we went in a hurry, as our dear wm needs to rush off to meet his fren. rushing-- due to some unforseen circumstances (coz he kinda forgot the time they r suppose to meet :X).  our gang was thus split into 3. wm n i taking the mrt towards the west-east line, gary, wc n rk walking towards ps to shop n eline (rk's fren) who took the train wif us but alighted at dg to change to nel.  later in the evening when i juz reached hm, my mum gave me a ring n asked me out for dinner. (sounds exciting rite? ya rite....) i simply can't gobble down the food as i was veri veri full after eating a large bowl of pasta. bloated should be a better word. haha... *bleah* my mum is veri nice to me... but sometimes we also get some misunderstandings... thanks mum, u r e best. luv u... *muach*   really enjoyed myself today, all thanks to my family n frenz. hehe... okok, giving my "thank you" speech again. thanks jasmine for making tt trip juz to pass me some notes n stuffs. but also want to tell tt 2pid guy (u noe who u r n everyone in the church does)... U stop Passing my PHOTO ard lahz!! so paiseh liaoz... today saw ur fren again, he was laughing like crazy!!! n not forgetting tt time when u bunch of ppl were at the bus stop outside holland drive... *grrr..*    ~And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years...~
