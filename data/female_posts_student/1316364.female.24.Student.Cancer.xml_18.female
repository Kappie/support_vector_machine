I also got to meet a few other family members of soldiers from the 319th HHC. One of the people I got to meet today was Gina Wilfong; she was very sweet but under the weather. I hope to get a chance to meet the rest of our FSG sooner or later. The event was fun. SPC Kinglsey showed us a few pictures he took while at Ft. Bliss TX. I got to see what the tent looked like that Jesse and all of our guys were in. It made me feel bad to think all our guys had to protect them from the outside was a giant vinyl tent. Last night Jesse sent me some pictures of him and a few of some other stuff and one of David. I sent the one of David to Danielle so she could have it.   Jesse looked so sad in his picture, it makes me wonder if he is really ok or if something is going on with him. We don’t get a chance to talk as much as I would like but then again sometimes we can’t always get what we want. I understand that eventually the calls will have to stop but right now I am not really willing to accept that fact. Tonight I am miss Jesse a lot. I am not too sure why I am feeling like this today, but I am really missing him. What I wouldn’t give for one of his powerful hugs and soft kisses. I would give anything to not have to go to an empty bed tonight and only have my teddy bear (Jesse Bear built with love from the Build-a-bear workshop) and my cat Pepper. I remember one time Jesse told me he remembered something I had said to him a long time ago. He said, “We fit together” lately I have been feeling like I am not whole, like I need my other part, the second piece to my puzzle. I often look at the sky and wonder if he is looking at the same thing as me. 9 time out of 10 you can bet he is looking for Orion, because he know that is the only constellation I could ever spot, besides the 2 dippers. Tonight I can’t see the stars, overcast, but I know deep down Jesse is thinking of me like I am of him.
