On Friday i went to the Rough Riders games with Maegan, Mariah, and Erin and we just pretty much walked around the whole time and got on the tv TWICE!! hehe but when we finally did go and sit down in the grass we met this guy names Mike who is the fireworks guy! He was so cool too. We were like annoying him to all capacity but he didnt really care that much. He even gave his watcer bottle to Maegan!! haha she like made out with him! We were trying to get him to like shoot off a firwork for us and like spell our names but he said he couldnt so we had to wait until the end when they won.     Then after the game I went back to Maegans and spent the night and we were like soo out of it. We were trying to do these exercise thingys but they didnt work out that great because we just kept falling over ourselves. Then when we got up around 11:30 or 11:45 we tried to do the exercises again but we failed again so instead we made cookies!! The dough was really really good like the best stuff the two of us has ever tasted but when they were cooked they were like a soufle and then just fell into a pancake and tasted really bad!     After we made all the cookies and stuff we both showered and then went to a firework show in Addison. We went and were looking for hot guys and saw one but then he just kinda disapeared. Then we were going to go swimming and when we were walking out these 3 like 18 or 19 year olds asked us to come upstairs with them. And maegan was like....uhhhh NO! WE ALMOST GOT FREAKING RAPED!!! ahhh. and then one of them like went out to his car or whatever and walked by the pool while we were in it and i swear me and maegan were as freaked as we could get. Then when we didnt think it could get any worse when we were in the hot tub people kept looking out of their windows. Like we kept seeing these mysterious hands in like 3 windows. So we decided to dry off and leave the pool.     After all of this excitment came more excitment! We went into the car and changed back into our clothes and the car would not start! The battery went completly dead, not even jumping it did anything. So we were there just kinda hanging out in the lobby watching SNL and mad tv and then getting on the internet and talking to people from the hotel computer until like 12:30. When I finally did get home i just crashed my bed and went to sleep because i knew today I would have to get up and go to another 4th of  July party and see  MORE  fireworks!
