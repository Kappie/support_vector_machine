Isn't that peachy? Today was alright I guess...I'm not depressed anymore, so that's a plus. I got told by Huebby today to pay attention! Wow, I'm proud of that guy, he finally found his balls.   Lunch was hilarious today, Sarah had Kent say "scrotum" just so that she would vote for him. It was great. Tomorrow we will be having "penis" yelling contests, and you could be a winner! Or should I say, weiner? Mwahahahaha!   Alright, enough of my perversion. Beach is going to freak tomorrow because I've skipped practice twice. Oh well, I didn't audition for the musical just to make freaky-deaky "corn" (in reality, its wheat with bright green tissue paper taked to it with electrical tape. What a budget we have.)  We had pizza for dinner. Two slices of supreme pizza and some Dominos dots. Yummy scrumbos.  I also just went over to my grandma's house to see my uncle before he leaves back for Tex-ass. He gave me a cool pocket knife to protect myself from the flocking males. Yeah, right. But I did get to see an entire episode of Fear Factor. Interesting...I will never eat a snail. Poor little guys.  And now I'm just sitting here, waiting until school tomorrow so I can start this boring cycle  allllllllll  over again. How much fun is that? Man, I need to take up a hobbie.
