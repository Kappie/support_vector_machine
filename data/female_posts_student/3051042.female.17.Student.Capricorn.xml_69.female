We first went out to STD testing centers but we can't find one that's free, because she's poor and I'm just not willing to pay. I'm going along more for support than for anything else, since Nikki is being a bitch and won't go with her. Both the Corner Health Center and Planned Parenthood charge up the ass. It pisses me off... and people wonder why others won't get tested, because they CAN'T FUCKING AFFORD IT!!!  Blah.   At any rate. We then went to the mall to shop....  lift . Two new tops, new earrings, a suit jacket, some cute little brief-like panties, a toe ring, and a new purse. Want to guess what I stole? Our clepto-total was around $75, but the mall is over priced anyway. She had $5 to begin with, and ended with the $5 as well. ;-)  Headed to Media Play to buy Lost in Translation and some CDs. Bought some chill out music, some Fat Boy Slim Live in Brighton Beach, and (randomly) some Kill Bill memorabilia. A lunch box for Nick and a Flask for myself. Media Play is so over priced. lol.  We chilled at my house for awhile to listen to some mashography, too bad Windows Media Player blows. Too bad I downloaded WinAmp to replace it. Fucker.  I started writing a script for a movie. Nick want to read it... beggars can't be choosers biatch. JK JK. I don't know, it's a little personal but he can watch it when all is either A) written and published or B) filmed. I'm excited. I like secrets... they're fun.  I think I need a new layout for my blogger, though I'm lazy and no one reads it so it really doesn't matter in my opinion.    DOES ANYONE READ THIS?!!! THAT'S WHAT THE COMMENTS ARE FOR!!!!!   Oh well..
