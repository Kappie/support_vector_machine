Before school had even started, I swore more than I had the entire two weeks off. F this and F that. In announcements we learned that Senor had done something good, well I didn't even pay attention. All the seniors got into really good schools, which causes me much distress. English was just English with Dr. Doden. We talked about Beloved, which I haven't even finished. I think it was funny, but I can't really remember. Nobody can retain information first period; it's just a fact. But math class........ oh Ms. Potts why do you hate me so??? First off, I sit at the far right side of the classroom, so when she writes on the far left board, with a black pen, in tiny writing, with a glare, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE! So, I was squinting, and she is like "Where are your glasses, Allison?" And I said I didn't wear glasses, and she told me I needed to get some. Then she draws this graph on the board and asks what it is. People shouted out really stupid stuff that was wrong. She then told us that it was half of an ellipse, people started laughing, cause nobody was close to that answer, and Ms. Potts said, "What did you do now Allison?" I WAS SILENT THE ENTIRE TIME. Ann and Anna were laughing really hard. Anna was red, because last night we talked about how much Ms. Potts doesn't like me, and then today was so bad. It was great. Third period History is just classic. I got a gold star, but I should have gotten two, but I won't let it get to me. Actually, everybody was really smart today and I was proud. Then Mr. O'Grady was telling us about this Japanese military general and his name was Toejam. WHAT?! It was Tojo, but Mr. O said Toejam!!! So I said, "Is that T-O-E-J-O-E?" OOH we were laughing. He kept instructing us about different Generals and Admirals in WWII, and I kept shouting out Custard, which is completely wrong on so many levels. Then Katie was like, "I'm really hungry. I like custard in a creme bur le (I don't speak French, I don't know how to spell that)" and I said, "Or a bear claw!!!" We talk about doughnuts a lot in that class. Chem was just Doc being crazy. OOH wait, in History, Chelsea was like "Doc lost his solar powered calculater, and now he has to use a TI-83, he's freaking out!" See, Doc has this obnoxious solar-powered calculator, which he has to throw against a desk to turn on. All of a sudden, in the middle of a test, he'll throw it across the room. DOC YOU ARE CRAZY. We weren't really doing anything, but Sam kept asking test questions, of course only she listens and pays attention. I didn't know what I was talking about in Spanish, as always. I speak crazy. Lunch was hot dogs, so Erica and I were really excited. I had kickboxing today, it was intense as always. Margaret and I got in a huge debate about  The Feminine Mystique   and the ideas about the role of women in society. I'm sorry, Margaret, but if I am unfortunate enough to get knocked up and have those brats, I will still work. They can go to daycare for all I care. I'm not giving up my life for them. Oh, by the way, Bush is going to try and ban partial-birth abortions, even if it will endanger the mother's life. So basically, ladies, you have absolutely NO SAY about your own bodies. You can get raped, and the government is going to think it's your own fault. So you must have your buck-toothed rapers baby and you had better change your entire life to become some poor mom. Have fun with that. Elizabeth Chinn and I talked about how stupid all this stuff is. She said they might have monitors, who will come stay with you and make sure you have that damn baby. If you don't want it, you shouldn't have to have it. It's your body, that's it. I don't care what anybody thinks; it's MY CHOICE SO SUCK IT. Anyways, I am scared of how Margaret will react, but alas I must speak my peace. Now I am home... but I do have some funny stories about my Grandmother: 1. There is this area by her house that has really developed. I asked if it had always been this busy in my lifetime, or if it was just land when I was a baby. My grandma said, "Yeah it used to just be land. They said it always would be. (In a sarcastic tone) That was a farce." AHH Grandma! 2. We were watching Dateline, and this guy was trying to lose weight. He had this really bad beard. There was a tuft on one side of his cheek and another tuft on the other part of the cheek. But there was skin in between, I asked my grandma what was up with that and she said, "Well, that's his own fault!" AHH I LAUGHED! 3. Now she puts black stuff in her eyebrows and my mom questioned it and she was like "I need help!"  LOVE THAT! Well I must do homework. BYE!
