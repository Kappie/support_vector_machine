I thought that maybe if I watched the movie, the book would make way more sense. Guess what?! PFFT!    I mean, it was exactly how I imagined it in places. The actor who played Oskar was just as creepy and child-like as I imagined. He was astounding. But, when he decides to perform oral sex on his first love, Maria, I nearly vomited. He looks like a three year old. It's pretty easy to forget that in the book, because you can just mentally block out the fact that a tiny, childlike horny teenager is humping 16 year-old girls. Man.    The best part of the entire movie HAS to be the Post Office scene with Jan Bronki and Kobeyella. God. Fuck. That was so good. If you've read the book, I would suggest just watching that part. It is so amazing. The actor who plays Jan is so friggin' good, that you die inside as he begins screaming "Agnes!" as the Germans invade the Letter Room. And when he starts laughing maniacally, holding the Queen of Hearts aloft.... Wow. Just nuts. So Fucking GOOD.    Holy shit! The part with the fish, and the eels crawling from the horse.... BLAH! So disgustingly good. Watching the woman who plays Agnes, you begin to wonder how much she is being paid. As Mr.Mazerath says in themovie, "She doesn't eat, she gobbles!". Not only that, but she throws up like eight times, sleeps with both men on screen, and probably has to endure the high-pitched screeching of Oskar more times then I care to think about.    If you've read the book, defiantly rent the movie. You'll find it both highly entertaining, and highly disturbing! I never actually finished the end of the book, so when I found out it ends when they board the train, leaving the grandmother behind, I was a little disappointed. But please, if you watch the movie first, you will never read the book, and will miss out on the huge amount of inner dialogue that Oskar doesn't share in the movie.    OH! I almost forgot! You know the part, "There once was a boy named Oskar"? They did it, and it turned out so good. But they just skipped out on the trumpet-player's story.    Lol, ok, I'll stop this post, but if you want to watch it with me, I think I'll have the movie for a couple more days. We can fast forward through the midget sex, if you want. Lol   AND PLEASE! If you understand the theme\anything behind this book, tell me. Because, after watching the movie, I still have no clue.
