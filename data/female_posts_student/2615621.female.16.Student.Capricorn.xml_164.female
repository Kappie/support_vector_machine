We talked about the O.A.R/Graham Colton Band/Howie Day concert and how it sounded like fun and even if the price i told her was about $10 too less for tickets, she still thinks it sounds like "a lot of fun". She said she would mention it to john, and how she's sure he will agree, considering hes wrapped around her finger. I told her about my outfit for the wedding this weekend and how i picked it out because i could care less what my dad's family thinks of me...its..hmm...unique. hahaha i asked to wear my converses with it, but got a no go on that. She told me that if i wanted to come home a week early it would be ok...what shes trying to say it "julia, i miss you and want you home" aww how touching. actually, i would like to really go home, but the thing is, if i leave next weekend, i'll miss my Everclear concert..so right now, im weighing the 2 options...idk what to do. i really wanna go to this concert cuz it would be cool to see them preform, but then again...they're not my FAVE band...and i couldnt be crushed if i missed it...but..i do think it would be cool to go...but then again, i have to make sure mom orders our tickets for the other concert..and if im not home i know she'll be clueless on what to do. and if i come home, she'll DEF take me cuz "i missed a concer to come home early thinking i could get to go to one in aug!" lol oh and she went and bought me a facial at the European Day Spa, so when i get home i get to go get a facial, which ive always wanted, because they clean out your pores and stuff. yays. Now, im thinking about going home. i dont know what to do. I figured i'd mention to my dad "hey i talked to mom today and she mentioned she thought i should come home a week early to get ready for my dr. appointment" my dr. appt. is aug.30th. haha i would have to come home july 17th, to prepare for my aug. 30th appt. wow. I want to come home and see my friends and have 2 weeks of real summer before i have my surgery. I dont know what to do...  now im listening to this 30mins 18 second radio show about "how to not get a speeding ticket" and this dude is callin in giving advice, saying the cops pull over on "sweet cameros" lol this is funny shit. everyone should hear it. how did he talk his way outta a ticket? cuz "ur picking on me cuz my car goes 85..and i pay ur salaries" hahahaha this is funny. http://media.ebaumsworld.com/index.php?e=iroc-speeding.mp3   yeah i agree with the guy, why dont cops go bust out rapiest, gang bangers, and burgulars instead sweet rides. lmao oh and speed raidars bounce off of a clean shiny car...lmao funny shit.  I have just destroyed one of my fave guitar picks. but i have 11 more like it. I started chewing on it, and totally cracked it and made all the color come off, and now it's in 4 pieces. I hate the thin picks. lol they chew up easily. fuck it.   *much love and palm trees*
