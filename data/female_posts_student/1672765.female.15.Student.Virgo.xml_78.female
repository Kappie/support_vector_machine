It hadn't been doing it that badly lately, but for some reason (I may have just been imagining it I don't know) but it was at the worse last night. So I wanted to turn off my computer but I saw that my video was downloading nicely so I thought I'd just put up with it. But then I got up about 45 minutes later (it was about 1 now) and it had 3 minutes left. So I just sat there and waited and it finished and I turned off the computer. I got in bed and I was saying to myself how quiet it was and how nice it all was (keep this in mind - the irony is killing). I had been leaving my computer on for the past week so today was really quiet and nice. Then I heard that stupid dog bark. That piercing sharp short bark cut the night. Man. Then he started barking more and more and pretty soon the two other dogs joined in too (joy joy!!)!! So this went on about an hour. Then I finally decided there was no way I could sleep with that (I can't fall asleep with any noises) so I got up out of bed and opened my window (they were right under my window!!) and banged on the screen. Sarah came running in all mad because she thought someone was breaking into the house (but she was already awake because the dogs woke her up). Banging on the screen didn't help. I went downstairs mad as hell not knowing what I was going to do, but I opened the door and the cold took my breath and any ideas I had away. So I was kind of jumping around on the porch (it's a concrete flooring) because it was too cold to stand still. I whistled for the dogs and when they came running I just whispered "be quiet" and went back in the house and shut the door. They were quiet after that. Thank God. But by then it was 3ish. I finally fell asleep around 4. Got up at 6:20 and I don't feel that bad. I don't sleep much and don't really need it. I'm always tired, I mean, so it doesn't make a difference. I had a headache before I even got off the computer and it hasn't gone away, though.   My mom, sister and I were talking about last night's events on the way home today and Sarah said she was in bed so scared when the dogs went quiet. She knew that I had gone outside and she knew that I don't like the dogs and are already mean to them. She said she knew that I didn't shoot them because she didn't hear a gun shot. She said she honestly thought that I went to the kitchen, got a knife and slit the dogs' throats.   When I was in bed listening to them bark I had all sorts of crazy notions in my head. I was imagining myself ripping out their voice boxes so they could suffer SILENTLY. I know that's mean. I'm a bad person, I never said I was a good one.  If they do it again tonight, I don't know what I'm going to do.   I don't know what they were barking at though, but me and my sister both heard the dog on the corner barking so that's probably the reason. Whenever they get into nightly barking fests it's always to the other dog on the corner I am pretty sure. They've done them before, but on weekends when I don't care as much and also they've never done it that much or that long before.   I wish I could blame my headache on getting only 2 hours of sleep last night but that's not it because I know I had it before I went to bed.   They are calling for a 'wintry mix' tonight. Everything was cancelled - basketball games, ACE matches, etc. Lots of folks think we won't be in school tomorrow. I don't know. I kind of want to go because if we miss any day this week we are going to school this Saturday. And I like my Saturdays, thanks very much.
