It is classical, something that blank and white movie stars would wear.  You see, while I was at my aunt's over thanksgiving she forced these two dresses on me, saying, "You never know when you will really need to dress up."  And indeed, I plan to wear one of them this weekend, just to be obnoxious.  Now, however, I have left both of them sitting in my purple velvet chair in my room, and have donned my blue silk kimono. Its late at night, I need something cool and soft. Sometimes, there is a crazy fascination with the opulence in which we all live, and I take full advantage of it.  For example, I bought blank plether high heel lace up boots today.  This may sound like just an odd list of clothing, and maybe it is, but it is also pieces of me.  I watch what people choose to don themselves in.  I think that it speaks about them, even in a subtle way.  Where is that symbol from, around your neck or snuggly tied quietly around your wrist?  What is the story of that worn t-shirt, and those jeans with all the wholes (holes) and patches?  Where did you get that tattoo?  Why?  Was there something that you needed burned onto your soul?  Those shoes have character, they are brazen or red or scuffed.  Are they carrying you away from me, or to me?    I plan to try on different me's this weekend, dress to fit a character which is clearly a piece but not everyday.  It takes to much work to be my diva, sex goddess, prowler everyday.  Taxing.  I am just a regular goddess on a regular day most of the time (did you not notice?  Well, goddess are silent and stealthy, they look like the rest of us most of the time).  certainly time for black plether lace up high heel boots...  I have been getting an odd high in class lately.  It is an electric charge that starts in my knees and moves into my stomach and chest.  It seems to be brought on as ideas and synthesis conforms into my world, and as the world expands to meet the possibilities that are.  It makes me grin.  It makes me talk too loud, to let out and away the thought of it, the need of it.  I worry sometimes, that I will be thought a freak, for being so overjoyed at the moment of potencial understanding.  When I know that my energy, my excitement, is just being broadcast through my skin and out into the room.  I am vibrating with the connections... Quantum.  I have been coming home over and over again to the idea that when we look at reality we are making it static, just as we do when measuring sub atomic particles.  I keep coming home to fractals- images in ideas in images in ideas, and these things that come back to us over and over, a pattern that we cant begin to understand, and yet live in.  Words that are changing my mind, not just altering my opinion, but possibly altering the mind in which meaning functions.  Surely they alter the brain, each pulse and firing that flashed in, changing it in tiny bumps and eye lash flutters.    These two rants seem to conflict, but in fact they are part of the same idea.  I am trying on world views, slipping in and out of roles, dancing through realities, and I plan to enjoy it.
