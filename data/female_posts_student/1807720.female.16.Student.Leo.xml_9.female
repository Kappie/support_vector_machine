But well I REALLY wanted to prepare really well for my quiz tommorow and well I am feeling pretty confident - but not over confident of course but I KNOW that if I want to do good I really believe that I have to power to.  And well I've got the Chem quiz on Friday but I am having some diffuculty understand the stuff and I did go to tutorial today which sort of helped but it's still confusing so I think I am gonna go for tutorial tommorow too and well what ever happens with my Chem quiz at least I know that I did my best and tried really hard.  And well this morning me and Chels got into a huge and I mean HUGE fight.  In fact I don't think we have ever had one quite as bad as the one this morning.  Because well I told her I liked Alex and all but we had a LONG and I mean long talk about how that stays between me and her so I found out yesterday that she told Lenny and well he talked to Alex and well apparently he likes me back which is a good thing and all.  But I was questioning her why she told him because well *I* wanted to talk to Alex and about the way I feel and for once *I* wanted to do something for me and instead of having it done the CHEAP way and having people set others up.  But I guess what's done is nothing and there is nothing that can really change that.  But I am actually not upset that we had that fight.  To be honest when she walked storming off I felt a huge sense of releif.  I feel like I am always trying to live up to her expectations and all and like she thinks she is almight and powerful and great.  Well I don't know how bad my attitude was but I was just questioning her and she took it the wrong way.  I think maybe though some part of myself is changing - espeically my attitude I just don't kow what is up with all that.  Maybe it is just a stage that everyone goes through but at different points in their lives.  But who knows.  I am feeling pretty happy right now actually despite being a bit well majorly confused in chem but math was SOOOOOOOOO awesome today.  I thought it was so fun, and like I was excited to do more practice problems.  Lol...if anything that so does not sound like me but it is so true.     The Untitled Poem  Floating on my feet once more I have looked on through this open door Steped inside to see what I face On this path to a better place  Knowing my attitude isn't always great But in life we must learn to appriciate All the things, the good the bad Even those that may be happy or sad  This is a stage I think all people go through Just some of us wish only we knew How to deal and get through each day Knowing that I can't always have my way  ~Vanessa
