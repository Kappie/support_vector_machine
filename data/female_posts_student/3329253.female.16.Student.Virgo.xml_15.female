Though it's kinda funny...Because I already opened it. So there really should be not that big of an emergency here right?? - I passed just 2 % under my goal. Which sucks because2 whole percent sucks like a sucks thing.   Updating the past while since I've written. Summer school sucks - though I have a very awesome cool mark of 91 - 4th highest in the class. So I'm happy. Which is more than I can say of my math mark... Oh well. I never exactly did that bad in math. I made a 15 percent raise in like 5 months right? Yea so school is a bummer.   Though it does have its perks I must say. haha me and ban and Dan and Sondy and nick have bonded as a group better over the weeks. I see nick Monday to Friday from like 8:00 to about 2:30. And yea I'm having fun. But you know what's funny?        Me andChu were talking today and we got on to the subject of university. So yea we're talking about what we'd be doing and than he went on about how the biggest thing that has kept us together would be our biggest divider. You know its funny how no one realizes that. Its like ... So not obvious. But think: We've spent most of our lives together in the same classes - or somewhat, we've spent lunches together, spent time together out of school, Spent money together even. Its interesting that University will be the force that may separate us from one another.        But your base group will always be your base group no matter what. The people who you call to when you want to do something at lunch, the people who you can hang out with,the people who are just there for you 24/7 as you know that will. Sure anew school means likea million students and like new friends. But I mean how close can you really get to another person who is fresh out of high school hanging out with the old crew on campus. The chances of that may be very slim.. But hey I still want to hang out with the old people that I love to hang out with from school and stuff. yea that was my argument.        But I know that most of us won't fall out of loop with each other - I just know we won't... Right?
