CHRISTI CHOVANEC'S NUMBER ONE RULE OF KEEPING WEIGHT OFF: only eat at one mexican resturaunt a night. (and bring your own can of diet dr. pepper.)  KENTESHEIA'S NUMBER ONE RULE OF KEEPING WEIGHT OFF: only eat at mexican resturaunt's where you don't intend to pay. (hence, mass amounts of chips and salsa.)  KRISTIN'S NUMBER ONE RULE OF KEEPING WEIGHT OFF: only go to the mexican resturaunts that bring you your food, but no plates.  looks like us ladies are going to be thin.   NEVER, NEVER, NEVER EVER GO TO TEJANITAS ON LOUETTA ROAD IN SPRING TEXAS. never.   first, kristin would like everyone to know, that the place smelled of urine.  kentesheia would like you to know that it was the size of my living room (+ the bar as the kitchen area).  christi would like you to know that that obviously "fake" chips, possibly hill top or sams choice, from food town were micorwaved warm, and that we finished the entire basket before our waters came to us.   we let this slide.  we continued to eat because christi brought in her own diet dr. pepper, and we were too big of wusses to do anything about it.   our waitress, don't ask her name or what she looks like cause she'd have to give us service for us to know that, wore her hair in a bun. i know this cause i saw her back throughout the night.  her highlights, let me say, were tacky.  when we finally got our food (we had no water again at this point) we asked for two extra plates, because the four of us were sharing two meals.  we decided to time the waitress' response to our request.  after seven minutes of staring at our food, we finally get up to complain.  as we're getting up, the waitress brings us two plates. still, no eye contact.  now we're contemplating if we should leave or not, because the service has been so bad, but we decide to stay because we had been waiting so long to eat some enchiladas.   i take one bite.  we find the manager, tell her we're not paying for this food, and leave.  now, if I say the food is too bad to eat, you know there are problems.   the cheese WISHED it was velveeta.   we headed over to el palenque, our favorite for spinach enchiladas. the waiters were nice, we had plenty of water, and the spinach enchiladas were as good as we hoped them to be.   NEVER Ever EVER GO TO TIJACRAPPY'S ON LOUETTA.  unless you want to keep off weight by following our tips. :)
