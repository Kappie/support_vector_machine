Marching band has started up again, and band camp is coming up. I've found someone that I completely adore and care for more than anything in the world. You know who you are :-). I went to the bank and I got an ATM card today. Woo hoo! Of course, I'm not supposed to use it without permission, but its still fun to have. And I went shopping. Fun stuff. So I'm going to a movie with some trombone guys in a little while. I went to this musical theater camp in Urbana last month, and had a ton of fun and meta bunch of cool kids. It was awesome.
