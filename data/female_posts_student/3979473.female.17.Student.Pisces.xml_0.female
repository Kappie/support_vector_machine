I always wonder what kind of an impact i've made on the world. Just cuz I'd like to think that someone would say to someone else someday, yeah i remember that girl! She helped me out of a real difficult situation when i thought nothing would pull me through. Wouldn't that be cool? In all reality, it seems that if ya change someones life, maybe just even one person.... you could change the history of the world. Take for example... um.... Hitler.. now there's a good example. What if maybe one person helped him out in art so that he'd become better at it for school or for a further carrier... he might have been one of those really nice famous artists that we other artists have to study and learn about in the books and go, oh that's a nice picture!  Another thing i've been thinkin bout recently, i've always wondered what it is that makes people so self concious about what others think about them. What's wrong with sayin screw the world, i wanna do this my way?!? We'd have lots more interestin things goin on if ya ask me. Not that the world isn't already interestin enuf but just sayin ya know. And if ya think about it some more, if we're always changin to please what other people think about us, then maybe our own actual personality gets lost in all of the changing to fit the crowd.... and we lose our actual own personality. Then ya gotta wonder if who ya are is actually you..... odd isn't it?   Anyway, i was just thinkin bout these things cuz i was sittin here bored cuz it seemed no one onlinereally wanted to talk, and i started thinkin ifi was doin somethin wrong to irritate em or somethin and i started thinkin if i needed to change my conversations and such to make people feel more at ease talkin with me... i mean i might be too intimidating or too cheery, or too immature, or too somethin ya know? ...... i hate thinkin. It makes me wonder about odd things that probably are irrelevent to what's actually happenin. More or less i should probably spend less time on the computer. Otherwise i might become addicted to talkin to people and thus become dependent on someone talkin to me ya know? Ok i'm done sharing for tonight. Maybe i'll talk somemore tomorrow or somethin. Catchya'll later! :D  Kate
