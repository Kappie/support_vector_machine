But we have to wait FOREVER for the "meet-n-greet", so that finally ends, and we say "Hi" and catch up with everything. Myles actually says hi to me and hugs me. Thad and Ryan are awe struck, But it was really cool. We finally say our goodbyes at, like 12:30-12:45, Jerry kiss my goodbye on the cheek, and the whole ride home, I can feel his beard on my cheek. Well, I finally go to bed at 1:45, and at 6:60 the next morning, mom wakes me up, and asks if I want to go with her to Illinois to see them that night. Of course I go! So I listen to their greatest hits CD the whole way there to learn the lyrics better. I am soo tired when we get there, and I call Brian's cell to find out where they are staying, and it is the NICEST place! But they have no rooms available! But she checks again, and says that if we wait one hour, we can have a COTTAGE!! I was like: OH MY GOD!! LOL. And the cottage is soo nice! It has a kitchen and a bathroom bigger then MY room! The couch turned into a sofa sleeper, which was awesome. So we nap in preparation of the concert. When we get up, we go to a bar and grill to eat.. Mine was....... Eh. LOL. But I do eat, and when we come back, there is a message on our phone from Jerry wanting us to join him at the "oyster bar" across the street. We meet up with him, and since we already ate, I ordered a key lime pie and a latte. It was soo good! But the Latte was bad, LOL.  So that was really fun. When we get back the stage crew that Jerry was going to the stage with are gone. He goes upstairs to call them to find out what's going on, and me and mom stay downstairs to wait, while doing that, we finally see Brian and Myles. We talk for awhile and Jerry comes back, and us 3 go down there. And we find out that its an out door festival for handicapped children, and Bikers are all we see! It was actually scary! So the concert starts at 9:30 and Brian gets us onstage next to Jerry and behind the stage hand. It was a blast! But after Jerry's awesome solo, I could tell that something was wrong with him.. He was just sick looking. I kept asking mom if he was ok, and I knew that he wasn't. But he keeps playing, and after "Roller" He gets up to stretch, or whatever, I'm looking ahead at the crowd and Brian and Jerry, when these two stage hands say "OH MY GOD!! JERRY FELL!!" I look over, and I see Jerry's hands grasping the side of the stage that is about 5 foot in the air. I run down the stairs and he is up, but he is soo disoriented, he is almost dizzy looking. But he gets back onstage, and plays two more songs! The man is 65 years old! I had never been so scared in my life. So the concert ends, and he goes back to the trailer they have for them, and a line forms for autographs, and Jerry signs them, he can barely stand! He says that he is going back to the hotel with us, Brian says that he is going with them, but he ends up going back with us. The had to get a golf cart to drive him the 10 feet to our car.. That's how bad it was! About 30 minutes after he is in his room, he calls for mom to rub his back for him, she won't let me go. When she comes back, she says that he has no bruises on him, but he is soo sore. We don't get up in time to say goodbye to the band, which sucks, but when we get home, me and mom pass out! I sleep on the couch from 3:30 till 9:30 then from that in my own room till 9:30 this morning! But earlier, mom called Jerry in Canada, and he is ok, just bruised on his legs. He had a concert again last night, he is incredible! But I thank God that I didn't see him fall. I would not be the same, I can promise you that!  On to more pleasant things; Matthew recorded another song: Anxiety, it is sooo awesome!! But what isn't by him? LOL. Um.. I had a weird dream with my friend Kyle that I do NOT want to go into details, LOL.  I came upon a horrible reality, I find myself forgetting things about Shawn already. I can't remember his voice, and that terrifies me. I remember everything else, but not his voice.... That's like a dagger piercing my heart. I can't believe this.. I am soo afraid that I will forget something else. I can remember his laugh, his smile, his eyes, his cologne. But not his voice, its like, a movie, you know? You remember the script, but not the actor saying it. **sigh** This hurts so bad. Oh Well, I'll hear him again in 2 months.... I hope.  ~~Breena  P.S. Im gonna write more poems.  "Blink" When giving up is your last option And there is no looking back In a blink you're gone When a smile cannot be achieved And tears will not stop In a blink you're gone When the end is near And life has just begun When the silence laughs And trees whisper In a blink you're gone for good When your heart breaks And your world crumbles When you're naked- vulnerable And no one takes advantage In a blink you're gone When everything goes right And you're finally happy In a blink you're gone  I really like that one!!  Shine your light On the dark corners of my soul Try and find What you have been looking for If you find it Let me know, for I have been searching too Fight everything The dragon, and beasts of the past Break through chains That keep me away from a deserving life Carry me though The fire and decay of my dreams Save me From the torture I give myself  100 Tears Every tear, a memory A smile, a look, a laugh One hundred tears Two years.. a lifetime Gone in a heartbeat... Much like life But a heart so guarded Has to come under attack Sooner then later When the white flag is waved Everything is over Its so hard to live With your face in my mind Your laugh in my ears Your touch on my skin Your smile in my eyes Your voice in my dreams The moon wishes me luck The stars mock my foolish ways Tears fall, memories coming back Eyes closing, preparing To do it all again   Angel  How do you explain When an Angel touches your life It's a feeling that stay with you until the day you die You came when I needed you the most You showed me that My life ment something Then you disappeared As quickly as you arrived The feeling you gave me Will never fade away I stay awake dreaming That I will see you again But knowing you are gone forever I'll remember everything about you forever I can never forget you Or what you did for me But how do you explain  When an Angel touches your life...
