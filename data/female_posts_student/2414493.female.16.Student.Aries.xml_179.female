I have to make up a math test at 6:10 am. It's going to be a long night, folks.  It's humbling myself to talk to him again. And it's almost frustrating since it takes a long time for him to respond and I'd much rather go to bed. Whatever, I had it coming. I hope this lack of sleep isn't going to affect testing. It's hard to tell what's going on in Ryan's computer.
