The retreat was good, the condo was great and cold and the beach was marvellous. My thighs ache much from the morning jog yesterday at the beach. And I'm not exactly a morning person.   School starts tomorrow and that sucks. I'm online now, at 8.30 pm simply because I know my classmates will start calling and I don't want to be reminded of them yet. Not yet. Am I mean? I have a whole pile of undone homework waiting for me and I don't feel up to it. I feel up to it sometimes you know, rarely la, not now though. Sighhhhhh   Piano exam is roughly 3 weeks away. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I am not prepared at all. I hope I don't feel. My oral is gone. So is the sightreading. Mazurka, my Elegiac Blues piece, CPE Bach, SAVE MARY-RUTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahahaa. scales also on the edge, gonna drop off and die liao. Gotta buck it up, M-R. Buck it up. Get more than a merit, get a distinction!   Whoa, did I just say that?   Goodnight, I'm off to prepare myself psychologically for school tomorrow. Argh, back to face the teachers again tomorrow. Yay, no English no Monday. Teacher is h o p e l e s s.   -showers of grace
