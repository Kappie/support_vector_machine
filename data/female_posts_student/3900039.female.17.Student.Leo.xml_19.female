We also went to the river and threw rocks in the water to get eachother wet, it was pretty funny. But while I was dropping him off at his house, I got a phone call...FROM LINUS OAKES ABOUT A JOB INTERVIEW!!! YES!! WHOO HOO!!! It's been soo long and I haven't heard from anyone I've applied to, so this is very good. :D and my dear friend Collin comes home tomorrow, well kinda late tonight, but early tomorrow morning is more like it. He's been in Mexico for a long long long time and I missed him alot so I'm very glad he will be home...for a whole five days...whoo hoo....no. anyways, I'm hanging out with my computer geek ryan and he is telling me what to type about and he suggested this story....the snake from hell. So while Lance and i were exploring at the river, I stepped on a snake and it jumped out and striked at me and hissed and i freaked out and was hysterical of course....it was bad. And this wasnt no gardner snake, it was LONG AND BROWN! I dont know what kind...which only scares me more. Ryan thinks it was an anaconda...I doubt it :D He is my massively best friend and he just wants to get me to freak out cause im so gullible but its not working this time hehe anyway, hope everyone is having a good day. Okay he just said "thats it? no life lesson?" sorry I'm no jacob bentley. BUt here, kids...dont do drugs, don't drink alcohol, and don't have sex. thats all folks!(happy ryan?)
