For example, "Sometimes, life is shasty," or, "That girls face is shasty!"     I never quite start my blog out right. It always ends up boring, so today I decided to put a crazy definition to spice things up a bit. Anyways, if I was a different person reading my blog, the first thing today I would want ao know would be there whereabouts of the small child also known as Fizzgig. So this is what happened with him since I last posted: at about 4 a.m. I finally got him to go to bed, so I went to bed too, alone...:(...sleeping so lightly because I was afraid he would come in my room and do something. Then apparently he woke up at around 6 a. m...yea, running on 2 hours of sleep, not something I would do but if he wants to, sure...why not? So he got up and watched TV for a while and sometime his grandpa brought out some medicine for him and notified the parentals that he was going out of town for the day, leaving him with us, so Mom and Jim took him shopping in Champaigne and then out to dinner at Red Lobster. He left with about 10 pair of shorts, 5 shirts, 2 pair of shoes, a hat, and some boxers. I'm beginning to think this retrieving tennis balls thing is a good idea...worked perfectly for him anyways. They returned home around 7 and he just did random things such as riding his bike and the scooter and swimming and finally he went home at about 8. Other than this, I can faitfully describe my day in one word: uneventful. I was left home alone, which doesn't bother me at all. It gave me some time to think about things, everything...but where'd it leave me? Nowhere really. Screw brains, they don't help anything. I actually spent time thinking of phrases I would learn if I went to a country that speaks a language other than English, but most of them are mean, so for the sake of my life in case a foreigner would just happen to come apon my site, I'll only post one of them. It came about when I was thinking of the trip to Mexico we took back in May or around then...one thing that sticks out in my mind is all of the male Mexicans hitting on me, no matter what age. So I thought of something I could reply to that, in any country with horny men lol. "Jo kashish hai, woh tho sirf andar ki dard chhupa raha hai," which translates to: "The magnetism you talk about is only hiding the pain inside." Sure it would turn a couple of heads and possibly confuse them, but it would stop them from throwing comments and proposals for a few minutes right? I surfed around on the net for a good many hours today just looking for something to occupy my time, and came across a site that told me what my name would be if I were a squirrel. "Arch Bishop McNutt"...lol, so for a small furry animal, I think being the leader of a province or something of equal power doesn't sound half bad! That's about all I found that sparked my interest on the net. I got offline at about 6 and spent a couple of hours playing Pacman, still unable to beat the level me and Tyler got stuck at that one morning...speaking of Tyler, I talked to him once today only for about 10 minutes, and the conversation consisted of a bet...which I lost...and a few nice thoughts. Well, that's all that's coming to mind tonight so I'm going to leave you with some lyrics and talk the night away on MSN...such a wonderful life...yea right...      Underoath-A Boy Brushed Red...Living in Black and White  Can you feel your heart beat racing? Can you taste the fear in her sweat?  You've done this wrong  It's too far gone  These sheets tell of regret   I admit that I'm just a fool for you   I'm just a fool for you.   Here is where we both go wrong  Tonight's your last chance to do exactly what you want to do And this could be my night this is what makes me feel alive Makes you feel alive  Here is where we both go wrong  So tie me up and toss this key cause for now we're living   In this momment that we both ignore the truth It's all over It's all over I feel your heart against mine So take a breath and close your eyes  Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing  My heart is dead, it's way past beating    Something has gone terribly wrong   I'm scared you're scared, we're scared of this  I never thought we'd make it out alive I never told you, but it's all in your goodbyes It's all in your goodbyes  Well look who's dying now, slit wristless, sleeping with the girl next door I always knew you were such a sucker for that It doesn't matter what you say You never mattered anyway You never mattered anyway  In this momment that we both ignore the truth It's all over It's all over I feel your heart against mine So take a breath and close your eyes  Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing  My heart is dead, it's way past beating   Something has gone terribly wrong   I'm scared you're scared, we're scared of this  I never thought we'd make it out alive I never told you, but it's all in your goodbyes it's all in your goodbyes   Don't shake, I hate to see you tremble  trembling You've lost your touch haven't you?  And I'm so addicted   so addicted.   Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing  My heart is dead, it's way past beating   Something has gone terribly wrong   Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing  My heart is dead, it's way past beating    Something has gone terribly wrong   I'm scared you're scared, we're scared of this  I never thought we'd make it out alive I never told you, but it's all in your goodbyes It's all in your goodbyes  I never thought we'd make it out alive I never thought we'd make it out alive I never thought we'd make it out alive It's all in your goodbyes
