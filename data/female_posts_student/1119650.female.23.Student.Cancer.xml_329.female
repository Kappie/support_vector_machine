Dean is a retired engineer and he means well he but has the annoying habbit of creating all of these theoretical situations and then says "well i know it doesn't matter but what if..."  Well, Dean, if it doesn't matter why are you even wasting my time with it, ass?  Dean is bringing with him, Bob, the other project manager.  This isn't even a real project but they're kicking all of these hypothetical and utterly impossible situations around becuase people in my town are lawsuit happy.  I appreciate they're trying to cover their ass, but they're overlooking the most basic aspects of the project in attempts to cover said ass.  I wish I never got assigned to this project.  Rar.
