[life]----youre standing out in the cold with your face pressed up against a window looking inside at a nice warm home, and you want to be inside more than anything to feel the warmth that you pain for but youre trapped outside...and life should be the other way around. you should be inside, in the warmth looking out at the cold, smiling feeling secure and sheltered. but its an illusion..we're in another dimension out in the cold and as close as the warmth may seem..its not even there. and youll keep standing there wanting it so bad.------- live.
