I had a drink the other night, a rum  coke, and i might have another 1 tonight if i can, but other then that im just gonna do homework and chill before i try (for once) to get a good nights sleep tonight.  I've been having a pretty good week, other then the fact that my house might be sold and i might have move out of the house, even thought i just moved into it in August...but other then that, I've been talking on the phone to my friend and Im gonna be driving more this comming week, hopefully to dean park, and home again...  Oh hey i have a job interview tomorrow, and i really hope that goes well, but i can only work on weekends, and possible evenings, it depends on if my mom is working or not, because i'll have to babysit.  Well I best be going for now...but i hadn't writtien a letter in this thing for a while so i had to update it instead of just putting quiz results in here  write more later  Nicole
