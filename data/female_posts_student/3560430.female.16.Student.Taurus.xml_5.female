The other day fo rthe first time ever in my history as a student worker at Crab Tree Corner I was allowed to work in the day care. The only part of that that  I really enjoyed was the fact that I got to hold this really cute little baby who for no reason I ended up singing at. My mom used to sing to me when I was rally little so maybe that was it. I think it was probably an unconsios thing. Of corse it could also be the fact that I tend to sing regardless of where I am. I must say thought that holding that cute little baby quickly lost it's charm once I had half my head of hair (Hyperbole) pulled out.   My work expiriance teacher came to visit me yesturday as well. It was cool becasue he's one of the few teachers I actually enjoy talking to! He was my grade eight drama teacher and was crazy good at his job. Unfortunately after a few tramatic grade eight classes he quit doing drama and moved to work expiriance. He says that the reason he switched to W.E. wasn't the kids it was that he needed a change. I really don't believe that. We got into some fun convos about my expiriance and he was really shocked at how much I wasn't shocked about what I saw. Maybe it's my craxy vivid imagination, but I find it very hard to be shocked. Maybe it's becasue my expectations are too high (in that I expect most of the people who come in to be absolutely screwed). I think if anything shocked me it was the behavior of teh staff. I find that when 'normal' people do wierd things it blows my mind much more than when people I expect to be fucked up do wierd things.   I'm just glad the 'Expiriance' is over. It leaves me time to wake up late, edit ect. I plan on finishing the editing today. That'll be nice. I hope I can get it to Beth quickly. I don't really think she'll be able to finish her part in time But I know she'll try. This is really my fault. I thought that I would be able to do stuff once I came home from work but really that's a no. I tried and got like a page done.   Away from that though, I think Bethie and I should do a web page together! It would be really fun!  And it could be like a summer project for her that allows her head to be able to do something on days that she feels she has nothing to do (I know how much that annoys her). So I'll throw that idea around.   I plan on going through my W.E. systimatically so that I can throgh all my thoughts around. We'll start haveing fun with roman numerals for the 'Blank' heading.
