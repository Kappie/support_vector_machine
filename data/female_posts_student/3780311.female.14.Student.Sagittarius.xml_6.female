Question:   why doesnt everyone love god?  God is such an amazing spirit, i dont see how people can hear about him but still make it seem likes hes invisible, they treat him like hes bad news made up by some storyteller, but to me, i dont see how people can do that, we are all different but its plain as day that things dont happenby luck or by playing your "cards" right but by living through god and doing for him instead of yourself... Isn't it ovious that God is soooo powerful and amazing, just by the HUGE book written about his only son who was sent here just because the world was going to hell and he gave himself up to save us all from the living hell? you can choose to follow God or The Devil right? why would u do thingswhich makeits difficult for u to find where to go? dontu want to be saved?! didGod not pay all hisblood and tears to the Devil for us, since the devil tookus all anddecided he wanted to teach us to Divorce, and Kill, and Lie and hurt? isnt there enough shame in knowing we were weak enough not to fight back tothat? why would anyone want to follow the devil?! It is said the Devil atchually believes in god, how is that possible if all the devil wants to do is have more power then god? god uses his power to help and heal people, and take us to a better place, yes people die. and its hard for everyone, but it isnt like god is taking lives away from us to cause pain and suffering,like the devil would...he does it because those people and being used for sonthing greater than anything here on earth.... but anyways.. thats all can say for now...:)... love god.. he loves you..
