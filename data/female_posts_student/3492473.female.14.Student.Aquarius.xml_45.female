Came home, talked to Alecia, read Chapter 9 of LOTF, talked to Annie.Chris was having a surprise party for Ree since it was her birthday today. So after soccer I was planning on going to the party. Before soccer I must have had some panic or anxiety attack because I was shaking really bad and my heart was beating really fast. I guess I was worried about conditioning. It wasn't too bad. Which surprised me. The only thing I really had a problem with was the first warm up mile we did. I was started wheezing and I couldn't handle anymore so with one lap to go, I had to quit and go get my inhaler. I don't like using my asthma  as an excuse . I feel like I should be able to finish that mile. But the cool down one we did, I did pretty good. I came home and got ready for the party.  That was a disaster in it's self.  My hair wouldn't do anything and I just kept throwing everything. And my room is  ALWAYS  clean so it was a mess after I finished. But I got to the party and well, I don't wanna go into too many details but parts were bad (pretty much everyone was drinking and a lot of people were smoking) but some parts were really good! Like seeing Alecia! God, I missed her! I hadn't seen like any of my friends since the festival which was a month ago! Everyone was like, "OMG! I haven't seen you in forever!" Even the guys.  So yeah, uh, I'm going to bed one happy girl.  Sweet dreams!
