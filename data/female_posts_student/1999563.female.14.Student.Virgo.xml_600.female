I really missed him on my trip to the beach. I forgot to bring my bible. :( I discovered how much I need God to be a good person. Like when I wasn't close to him I was this disgusting, awful person. I never want to be around me when I am far away from God.  I think today we are going to help my moms friend move.  I finally bought the Inhabited cd!!!! I also bought this awesome shirt!! It says "I hate meatloaf" Hahahahaha.  I am so excited.  I hope it comes in the mail  soon!  When I continue on my path of inspiration I shall tell you all about it.  Yours until we meet again,  Laura  P.S. Have you noticed that since I started being "inspirational" all my friends have joined in? Haha!
