We wandered round deciding what had changed and what we remembered like old people talking about their past. It was kinda scary walking round somewhere we hadn't been in over 3 years, but we were still glad to be visiting all the same.   Yesterday was the last day for the Gorse Hill's (my old school's name) students, so we were bombarded with little kiddies for the whole day which was pretty crap. They're so annoying at that age. We took refuge in one of the empty classrooms and stayed there for a good part of the day.  Today was a bit more interesting, partly because there were no more little kiddies so we could roam around as we wished. I brought my Ouija board in to try and contact any dead headmasters or people who had died that used to be students at the school. 2 people contacted us, wasn't very successful though. After playing games with the teachers, we went home, thoroughly worn out. Not much more happened after that, except I ate potato wedges, but thats hardly interesting.
