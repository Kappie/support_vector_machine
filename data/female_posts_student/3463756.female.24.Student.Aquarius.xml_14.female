My sis who wanted very badly follow a certain path is being prevented from doing so by circumstance. My dad,who lives in a place not many people go to voluntarily,(but where he went voluntarily because of his desire to see both me and my sister get what we want) is now having a rather rough time of it. And my mom who feels her hands are tied by us all is depressed. Add to that I feel guilty that I am not that miserable here and far away from the rottenness that prevails around the place where I lived.  but then I spoke with my dad. Probably one of the few times in life where I actually had an honest open conversation with him. Probably I think due to the fact that the conversation was not about me. He wrote a very nice email to my sister who felt happy again and so the chain goes on. The bluebird of happiness had made its rounds...  but why is it that most people are unable to empathise with other people effectively? I see people in one way, mostly in shades of grey. So I never can understand why others see in only black and white... Am I so different from other people that I see things differently than they do and that its easy for me to place myself into the other person's shoes?
