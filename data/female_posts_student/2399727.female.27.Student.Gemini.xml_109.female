That's the worst; they never seem to go completely away when you wake up with one.   People seem a little on edge today.  Trying to get things done but nothing is happening; can't leave home, waiting for phone call, can't do anything sitting here on my butt, nobody is where I want them to be.  Almost said "nobody is where they should be" but suddenly realized that it's a "be there to answer your phone" style of selfish mentality.  Will leave here at 11am regardless of whether the phone rang or not.  I have to go to the Fac. of Theology, to confession, to Mass, and to a bank machine.    More to come...
