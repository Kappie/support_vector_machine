It makes me feel better about life n such. Anyways its great. It means summer is coming. And I can't wait. This summer should be pretty good since I'll be pretty laid back. I can't take drivers ed till next year because Im to young. Its gay. And Im to lazy to get a job. So yeah. I'll probably attempt to live in Humboldt as much as I can. Anyways...as I was saying...  Spanish today was alright. Barely did anything so I did some homework and yeah it was just peachy. In Science we went outside. It was a tad chilly and my shoes got all muddy. I was mad. But all the mud came off in the school. lol. Poor janitors. lol Yeah that was alright. In homeroom dumb DeGroot made us all fold programs for the play which is tomorrow night. Eh. It was dumb. And I can't fold worth a toot. lol So yeah. Algebra was poopy like normal. Band and choir were alright. Tracy, Jessica, and I wandered the halls for food and then went back. In band Tracy, Krystal and I wandered the halls again...once again for food...and then we decided to sit in the hall with Greg. That ended up being quite amusing. Greg probably got bored with us...or scared...of us freshmen but oh well. Hes great. Then Tracy grabed Camy's shoe and then we started trying to throw it into the garbage can. It was amusing. Very. LoL So yeah.   Then I came home got online...discovered Ross wasn't on...and I was tryin to think if he said he was gonna be anywhere or something...right then he calls. His stupid internet was down. So yeah we talked for like an hour and a half. Then he realized his parents would probably kill him since he was calling long distance. LoL So yeah. Thats pretty much all that happened today.  -Tara
