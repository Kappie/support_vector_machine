Well school was long, I don't even care for it anymore. It's sad in a way, I used to be so caught up in it but what for? ya it's going to help me with my life but without a heart or anyone there with me for the journey, what good is it really for? So ya school sucked. Afterschool was heartbreaking as usual. Then I had to go to work. It was okay, a good distraction for my mind. Then since I was closing I was there alone and like around 10ish an Indian dad and daughter come in and he's arguing with me about giving him free pizza for his daughter but this guy is wearing a gold necklace with a rolex and he's telling me and my manager he doesn't have 5 dollars for his starving daughter. It was so clear he was scamming and my manager got mad after he left but for some reson, I was still feeling bad for him. He's being selfish and not thinking of his daughter cuz when I looked in his daughter's eyes I was bout 2 cry but he couldn't see that. I felt bad for him. I wish he could fix himself before it's too late. Then I go home and as soon as she opens her mouth, my mom's aggravating me already. I don't yell or show signs of it but she's yelling at me for the stupidest things like the sweater, me sleeping, etc..and I'm probably aggravated because she's SO bitter about screwing things up with her life yet she's too stubborn to 'fess up and say she's wrong and change, everything is always mine and tim's fault and we have 2 just put up with it cuz she thinks she's not selfish but in a way, she definitely is. And I'm aggravated because I see that that is who I am/was. I do not want to be that. As much as I love her because she's my mom, she is the last person I want to be like. She still hasn't realized what's wrong with her but I've at least realized there IS something wrong with me and am trying to fix it. I don't even want to go out with random people anymore or be fake like she is at work parties, I just want to be able to change and be happy with myself cuz (and kevin's going to hate me for saying this) but I'm not happy with what I've done to myself and everyone I love. Speaking of kev kev, I gotta sign that kid's yearbook still like 3 pgs and get his money for saves the day concert hehe he's great. Well my mom's bitching, bye... "i never really wanted you to see this side of me" *crossfade
