I am not in this world to live up to your expectations  And you are not in the world to live up to mine.  You are You and I am I.  If by chance we find each other, it's beautiful.  If not, it can't be helped]   [You see, I cannot do my own thing without affecting you. I am not free to swing my arm if it is likely to hit you on the nose.]   (like rubbish)   [If I just do my thing and you do yours,  We stand in danger of losing each other--and ourselves.  I am not in this world to live up to your expectations  But i am in this world to confirm you  As a unique human being  And to be confirmed by you.  I must begin with myself,true;  But i must not end with myself:  The truth begins with two.]   (soo true)
