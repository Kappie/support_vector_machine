Actually i'm pretty sure i'm not. i'm sick of the song and i want to play what i want and not have to be bogged down by polishing a song that i've been playing since october. *sigh*   well, i started picking out senior recital music. it's really wierd to think about. i need six piano pieces spanning the music periods. so far i have two romantic, one boroque, and a modern. what to do. anyone know any good classical? i don't think people will find much enjoyment in my recital. i would rather play jazz the whole time and just be background entertainment than be the center of it all. i will be playing just so people can listen. now normally i'm in the living room, no one's home, and i play for pure enjoyment. wierd...i like my way better.  tomorrow is instrumental solo contests. *breathe* my vibratos going to be pretty heavy tomorrow, being so nervous and shaking. crap! why must i shake when i'm nervous? oh well. i wonder what time i play?   Grew a mustache  a mullet? -Betso
