In my line you don't have to." ~Elvis Presley (1935-1977)    I have come to believe that there is no honor left in the entertainment industry anymore!  No, this has nothing to do with Janet Jackson or Justin Timberlake (both of whom have lost whatever scrap of a scrap of respect I once and ever had for either of them); it’s about the industry as a whole.  Honesty I don’t know, perhaps my standards for entertainment are too high, yet I can’t help feeling that I have a right to demand good entertainment from those who proclaim themselves modern day bards.    I wish I could say that it is music and only music that has earned my ire, yet alas…  Music may be the one I have the most to say about, but it’s not the only entertainment industry on my “hit list”, so to speak.  So let’s begin where it would seem most logical…   Music   Even if we were to forget the fact that nearly all musicians are uneducated buffoons who get their kicks pulling stupid childish stunts for millions (yes, Janet  Justin), the music industry would still be full of crap for tunes.  Modern day music is childish, loud, annoying, and fully of lyrics that say nothing more than lude lyrics about sex, drugs, sex, violence, sex… I think you catch my drift.    As if bad lyrics weren’t enough to push my buttons, push all of our buttons, musicians insist on doing things that demean the average listener.  Michael Jackson repeatedly getting arrested for allegedly molesting little children, how many?  I have lost count… Janet Jackson exposing herself to millions of adults and children alike at the Super bowl half time show with the assistance of Justin Timberlake.  Aerosmith defiling the national anthem a few years back, musicians breaking away from their groups because they think they don’t need them anymore (i.e. N’SYNC and Destiny’s Child)… the list goes on.  I can’t help but be insulted and enraged by their lack of propriety where their fans are concerned.    On top of all of those problems with the industry and musicians, many of our modern day musicians are uneducated and make their money by selling their bodies and raunchy lyrics to the fans for 14.99 per CD and thousands per ticket.  Britney Spears for example dropped out of school in the 9th grade to pursue her music career.  While I have to admit that she had a beautiful voice, her lyrics and wardrobe –or lack there of- leave something to be desired.   Yet in the mess of uneducated airheads like Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears, I have found a shining star –my husband actually has found her.  I am about to recommend a singer to you all, go buy her music you won’t be disappointed (as long as you like good music that is).  Her name is  urlLink Norah Jones .  Her music is light and fun, her lyrics actually make sense (be still my heart), and on top of all of that she can actually sing!  He found her when watching a special about music on the Discovery channel.   What he found what that she tries to infuse her music with the Phi the magical number, 1.618.     Television   I’ve said it before and I will say it again, reality TV is for the birds.  I despise so called ‘Reality TV’ as it serves the lowest quotient of our population and serves to feed myths about American reality and daily life to the world.  On top of that, I believe soap operas –which most of us are addicted to.  I myself am a recovering soap-aholic- are only slightly better.  All in all, television has grown to be sad and uneducating, going to show that the myth that TV will lower you IQ is so much more than correct.    Now don’t get me wrong, I love the History channel, History International, A, Discovery, Tech TV, and the Travel Channel.  So not all TV is bad, just most of it…   Movies   Movies are getting worse and worse.  Acting is getting better and screenplays are getting worse.  There are some exceptions to the rule, yet I find myself longing for a good movie.  Matt and I went to see Mona Lisa Smile and it was the most enlightening, fun movie we have seen in a long, long time.  Still most people had the nerve to call it dry and boring… I sigh.  So all in all, I have to wrap this up by saying that everyday I grow more and more disgruntled by the entertainment industry.  The only industry that hasn’t disappointed me is the literary industry, thank the heavens!  So if anyone knows of a good movie or music please, please email me and let me know.  I long for something interesting and fresh…  ~Kristyn
