So I went on ebay, found one and it should be in the mail soon. I am so excited that the first part of summer session will be over next week. I am starting to feel a little burnt out. I will get a month off school in August-September.   I am done with the West B. I will find out August 2nd if I passed. Wish me luck.   Next week I start my second methods for teaching elementary math class. I can't wait...I am totally joking there. I am going to have to work my ass off to get higher than a 3.5 in the class. I got a 91 on my Economics test...that sucks. I am going to have to do a lot better than that. AHHH...the pressure.    Talya
