Why I am saying this.One of my good friends , Sinha recently started blogging ( he insists on referring to me as mr.c there) and in his second entry has made out as if I am the biggest hogger aound (no considerations for Nisheeth or Bhavya). No I am not, and I like to have good food as other normal ppl do. [ Well I have not added him to my links, not coz of the above mentioned stuff, but coz he knows he has to make it a blog worth viewing before that. Sinha u kno, only u have to go through this ].  Today in the morning when I saw Nilesh with his electric guitar and amp. for the morning assembly , I got really excited , expecting some good rock/metal number. I mean its been a long time since we had those guys jamming (last time was the day before the summer hols).But I was heading for a huge disappointment. They started playing Hotel California( soft by their standards) and with Sehrag singing, ohmegod.The mikes also gave up on them. A Disaster. Anyhow, from now on Damini will be called queen meeny miny monroe ( in short qm cube) on my blog.   [By the way, I havnt taken any serious offence against u Sinha, so plz chill. I kno u love to tease me.]
