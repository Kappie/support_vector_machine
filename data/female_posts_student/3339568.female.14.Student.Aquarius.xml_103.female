Well, in case you didn't know, seeing as the whole church, and pretty much the whole world knows. Luke and I are going out. That was just 4 all of you who hav been living in a hole and don't know! (and Hannah W u didn't know yet because i couldn't get onto you!) So neway, we went 2 coffee bout 11.00, and Luke lost track of time, so he had 2 go, but he gave me this poem he had written. A very romantic poem. Pretty much self-explanatory of feelings and hopes 4 our future poem. So I'm walking home in the rain reading it, in disbelief, smsing luke 2 double check its bout me, yup is, yeh feelings mutual etc. Yes! It is. Yay :D So everythings pretty much perfect :) Love is an amazing thing.  So then Mel and I hang out and chill, being the amazing musos we r, play the guitar basically the whole time. I learned 3 new songs, Here I am To Worship, Feels Like Home, and This Kiss. This Kiss is Mel's fave, shes playing it right now in mi room! :) So we shot off 2 church, which we were both totally looking forward 2 going 2 because we had missed it, the service was good. Sermon good, Sal was very enthusiastic and full of spirit 2 say the least! Although I couldn't fully enjoy it because I was feeling a bit light headed. It was very hot in there. Don't know what Tom's talking bout it being cold!! Oh and on the topic of Tom, he gave me his sermon on CD!! Yay! 'Snaps 4 Tom' Ur a champ Tom! Moving on...but then after I went out 2 the front to be prayed 4, and it was the most amazing feling. All my friends surrounding me praying for me, and I felt so full of spirit, and close to God again! Thankyou Lord, for everything. And the best thing yet, is i actually feel accepted in the group now!! I dunno why, I just do. We went 2 Macca's after. Our group took up pretty much the whole place, and we filled the roles of evil, raucous teenagers very well! :) Pete H FINALLY found out who I am!! 'Bout time too! Ahh, meh, he'll prob. end up 4getting me again neway. The whole day was just so great, dreams coming true, feeling accepted, and being closer 2 god now. Oh and the guitar!! 'Snaps 4 guitar' So yeh, I betta b off, can't leave Mel 4 much longer! Blogging off, an extremley contented and thankful, Beth
