Anyway, the picnic was fun, the people that Ed works with are all wonderful people and I am glad Ed had the opportunity to work with such wonderful people.  I must admit however that the change will be good.  I think one more tour with the Marines and I would like Ed to spend the latter half of his Navy career on the "blue" side.  The "green" side has been kind to us, but I think Ed will further his career on the "blue" side of things.  "Blue" is with the ships and all that stuff, and "Green" is with the Marines.  Anyway my cousin't wedding is next week and I did not lose any weight.  Oh well.  Another time,s o I have to be prepared to field the ever so kind, "Lanie, YOU'RE SO FAT!"  Oh really?  I didn't notice.  lol  Thanks for stating the obvious, can I go now?  Gotta love family.  IT is nice and hot and I should get to work.  I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, all 4 of you who read this.  haha
