   So, Again, I have been lost in my own thoughts, and here's what I've come up with.        At school ((which is about to start VERY soon)) Everything is just one big soap opera, An unentertaining soap opera at that. And since all summer, I've been somewhat isolated from the series, And Haven't been having withdrawls, I don't want to be in the next season.  So, I've come to the conclusion, To hang back, Learn, Socialize with those who I already know, and Make no attempt to be noticed. And If this doesn't work... well... Then I guess you can consider me an actress, But I don't plan on that.         I have become quite content with my newfound happyness.  It's Great to feel... Great, and quite a posotive change at that.  Jacob, Well, What is there to say. He's not like everyone else, He's Nice, He's cute, He's big enough to defend me, small enough to cuddle ;), What more could a girl ask for? I've got it made.          Well... That's all for now, Next stop, Sleep! yay!
