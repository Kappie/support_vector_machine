Lisa did not go either but that's a whole other story.   Coming home felt wonderful.  I arrived in Houston on the night of 29th and was greeted in the airport by my mom and Richard. It was really nice to see them especially after such a long flight from San Fran home.  My mother wanted to stay up until 4AM in the morning chatting so I didn't get much sleep that first night as I was leaving early the next morning for the Family Reunion.  It was soooooooo great to see my grandmother. I also went to visit them on Tuesday for the day.   I got into Austin on Wednesday and it was just CHAOS from the moment I got there. Not necessarily crazy partying but just people were very different. Everyone was the same but a little stranger looking to me, familar faces that I couldn't remember the names to match.  I got to see a lot of people I knew especially at the Pride Festival on Sunday. Another story I just will not write about here. (Damn, has my blog just gotten way to personal here???).  It was sooo nice to see all my ECI Alumni peeps. Thank you to Lisa Letchworth and Paddy Langford for organizing everything and allowing us to be at his place.  Thanks to everyone for coming over - it was truly special to see all of you.  I felt so loved and so supported.  You have no idea how much this meant to me. Thanks again.  I am back in Houston tonight...which is great. It's good to just be at home where things are much simpler.  I can lay on the couch and not worry about everything that is eating my alive right now. It was tough drive for me home - just bad weather and a lot on my mind.  Well, I am not much in the mood for writing now but just thought I would check in for a bit and let you know I am alive. Not sure when I will be Austin again but will keep you posted.   smooches, Shell
