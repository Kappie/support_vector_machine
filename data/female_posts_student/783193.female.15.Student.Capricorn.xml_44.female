The whole time in the car, I was thinking that I didn't really want to see 2 Fast 2 Furious, because it just didn't seem like a movie I'd like. Well, actually, in the car, we were talking about all kinds of things, like scars and Barbies and falling in the bathtub, and we were squishing four people in the back (that always seems to happen in cars that I'm in...), and we kept passing these cops. I think we passed three that had already pulled over people, one that pulled someone over as we passed, and a few waiting to pull people over. It was fun, but poor Talli had to sit on the floor. Meanwhile, we all were laughing and poking Jieun's "slab of poo". It was pretty gross. So we got to the place, and we were buying all our tickets and stuff, and waiting outside, and then everyone arrives at various times, so we go into Fuddruckers. I ordered a cheesy mushroom burger, and Alysia, Ro, Jane, Jessica, Elaine and I sat next to the window. Yum. Then we had a little while before the movie, and we walked around and got dessert and stuff. Then we headed into the movie, and there was the big poster for Pirates of the Carribean, with Orlando Bloom right in the middle. His head was practically the size of my body, and I was like, whoa, but he didn't look as hot as he did when I first saw him, which was in The Fellowship of the Ring. Okay, back to my point. 2 Fast 2 Furious started about seven minutes after we got into the theater, and it started off with this racing scene. The thing about the movie is that it really pumps you up. It kind of gives you an adrenaline rush, just watching the people race. Then Paul Walker comes in, but I had no idea he was Paul Walker, because I hadn't seen The Fast and the Furious, and I'd only heard his name thrown around a bit. So I'm practically jumping on Ro, who was sitting next to me, and trying to tell her how hot that guy on the screen was (sneakers and all) over the noise of the revving engines. She heard me, and was like, "Duhhh, you weirdo." And that subdued me for a while. I just couldn't stop looking at his face though. He's so amazing! I couldnt' believe he spoke Spanish. I guess that'll be my inspiration for my Spanish elective next year... Anyway, back to reality, summer PE began today, and it's a lot easier than I thought. All we do is bowl for practically the whole period. Then we have a half-hour break, and run, and if there's leftover time, we play softball or something. I have Treglown, who has really skinny legs. He can yell pretty loudly too. The only bad thing is all the construction is going on at the highschool, and it's really stinky. Well, I still have to go to Kumon, and tomorrow, I'm going to a party at Ulka's house. Like amovie-marathon or something.  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/stars2/WeLovePaulWalker/  Just so the oblivious, like I was, know who Paul Walker is. Hey, I didn't find out until yesterday.  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/stars2/WeLovePaulWalker/gallery/cosmog.jpg  Cissy: Sizzle, sizzle.
