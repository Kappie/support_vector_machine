Just about every fairy tale and nursery rhyme were made fun of or had a satire about them in that movie.  Then  he fixed my computer so that i FINALLY have aim now. I know, I'm such a dinosaur!  finished packing today which was just a magical experience. I think that if I go to hell at the end of my days, my punishment for all of my evils will be the task of packing for eternity. WOW that would suck. Anyway, that was pretty much the sum of the last couple of days. My life is so exciting, I know.
