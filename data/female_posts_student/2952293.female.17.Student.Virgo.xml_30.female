All I know is that in English, a few days ago, Dr. Doden was talking about his mom being a WWII veteran, and Ariel asked, "Was she a nurse?" And Dr. Doden freaked out, "NO MY MOTHER WAS A U.S. MARINE!!!" It was really crazy! Ariel was so embarrassed, but she didn't know.  SAT class was better than ever! Everybody remembers how last summer I lost my flip-flop down High Street when there was a flood, right? Well, Chelsea should know that you can NEVER wear flip-flops to SAT class, but she did. And as we sprinted across High Street, her shoe came off right in the middle. I had to run back and get it for her, since she was really wet and cold. This kid came in late and put his coat on its own chair, I thought that was funny. In the middle of the lesson, he said to the other boy, "I thought I'd seen a dude like you in White Castle." Then five minutes later the other boy said, "If it makes you feel any better, there's somebody at my school who looks like you." Okay, that was just the funniest thing that has ever happened. The class was crazy, as usual. The smart girl kept saying, "We can have a party at my house and burn our books!" Dude, nobody would go to that. That kid is just hogging Priya, the smart Indian girl, that Chelsea and I want to be friends with. I had this intellectual moment with the teacher, and all the kids thought I was a dork. Then this kid, Hank, was reading a section of the Critical Reading passage, and he said, "...the Wiliad" NO THE ILIAD YOU FOOL! Then one boy said, "There's only 7 hot girls in my school, and I got one of 'em." We were reading this question and there was this answer and it said something to the effect, "An elephant is drawing in the sand with a pebble or stick that he puts in his trunk" I MEAN WHAT IS THAT?!?! It was just really, really fun!  So now school is just boring. None of the juniors have brought their stuff for the Junior Picture. But we're doing it tomorrow, hopefully. Poor Uli is suffering so.  I had a hard Chem test today, I do not know my results. I really don't want to blog anymore. But before I go, I just want to thank everybody who has been so nice to me these past couple of weeks. The support and kind gestures really help me and make me feel better. I love my Unies, thanks guys!
