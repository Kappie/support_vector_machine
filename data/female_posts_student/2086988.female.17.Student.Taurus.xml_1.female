Oh well...OMG, I haven't talked to "D" in like forever, he told me to call him Saturday but he had his phone off, then I called last night and he didn't answer...does he not want to talk to me :( :::cries:::, lol jk! I am loved ^_^ I'm pretty sure he's just really busy, I hope he's not avoiding me again. Since I did nothing, unless that email I sent on Friday freaked him out, but I doubt it. Oh well, I'll talk to him soon enough...   If youâ€™re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
