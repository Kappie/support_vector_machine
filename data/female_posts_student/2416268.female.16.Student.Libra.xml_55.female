"it only takes one tree to make a thousand matches it only takes one match to burn a thousand trees"  ok so today so far has been a pretty random day, to go with a pretty random person I suppose,   hmmmm............................   ok so I am having a few problems writing on here today, I just don't seem to be able to get the sentences flowing, not that they usually do, but its become really difficult tonight.  Haz - sweetheart I really hope you feel better soon, have a cup of tea, it is the quintecenctialy english cure for everything. Dont worry bout that problem, you will have to put up with the rest off us instead, sorry about that. oh and sorry for being an emotional bugger earlier, dunno what was up with me.  to the rest of you i dunno really what to write, i no dan is getting impatient so i will hurry it up, lol  ok im gonna give up now, this is proving almost impossible, i will write in a couple of days or so, when i can think of more to write  Love ye Nat xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (the fairies not working again bloody things, they will be back though) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
