They gave me a REAL guitar this year.  Complete with case, pitch pipe, and books (to learn chords).  Anyhow, I'm really excited.  And I got a surprise from my brother!  He got me tickets to Blast! in Houston.  Well, a ticket for him and one for me.  We're going on his birthday, 11 Jan.  So, the weekend before classes start, I'll be in Houston with my brother at his new apartment.  Partying.  Hopefully I'll get to see Dave and Jana... and their new baby boy Hayden.  WOOHOO!  Anyhow, from my other relatives, I received money from my Grandma, and from my Uncle Scott I got CDs and DVDs.  He also gave me a gift certificate to Best Buy... that combined with my G-ma's gift will buy me TSO (The Sims Online)   YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     From friends I received:  Melissa-Chasing Amy DVD (awesome!) and a Ben Kweller CD (which I'm already liking a lot);  Jennifer-a shade thing, and a candle that smells wonderful!; Wolf-Bath and Body Works stuff (woohoo); Druck-this kick ASS moving picture!  it's so awesome and all my relatives now want to steal it from me; Ricky-I got 2 DVDs... When Harry Met Sally, and Minority Report!;  Jamey-she's bringing me wonderful stuff tomorrow...  I had a wonderful Christmas... and I have wonderful friends to be thankful for...  Merry Christmas to all of you... I love you guys!    I also got to see Ben and Lizzy last night at church!  It was wonderful... I haven't seen them in such a long while... I didn't realize how much I missed them... Me and Ben showed our tattoos off to each other.  It brought back memories... and we got some good hugs in... hopefully we'll see each other at church Sunday (provided we both show up).  I saw Jeff Timm, too.  He seemed so glad to see a familiar face.  It was fun for all.... :-)  That's all for now kiddies... leave a message if you'd like.       urlLink  postCount('25Dec2002');
