That he wana do well in uni bcos of her, frames up this v'day pic of them, places it on his desk for motivation and inspiration, knoes she's bored at work, promises to send her a new song everyday hoping tat will cheer her up. Oh by the way, he's in BNE. Thats why he cant do much. But is she gona break his heart like how the bad doppio broke hers? Babe ur so rite. Good guys always come in last. But maybe not this time round, she may just give him a chance.  But how bout the hot nose-pierce guy? Is she jus gona leave him aside? Dangling in mid air like wat doppio did to her? Haven tot of that yet.   Would you choose to be with some1 you love or some1 who's nice to you? She used to say "some1 I love!" but tat has always resulted in heartaches.  One after another. Without fail. Maybe it's time she chose some1's who's nice to her.  For it's better to be loved than to love.  Sent:  Thu 5/27/2004 12:13 AM   Subject: Just for you!!!!
