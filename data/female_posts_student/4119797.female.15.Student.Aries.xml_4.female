Of course, she couldn't hear me as she was in the tv. I also, really think that they should invent something to record your thoughts. Like do you ever have those times where you completely zone out and start thinking about the coolest things but like when you snap out of your little day-dream, you can't remember what you were thinking. That happens ALL THE TIME to me.  I just don't make sense anymore. I don't know if it's out of laziness or stupidity, but I just can't explain things the way I mean it anymore. Maybe it's because Im out of school so my thoughts aren't all straight. Oh well.
