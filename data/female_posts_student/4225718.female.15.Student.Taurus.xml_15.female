     
      she wakes up from a pointless nap. she is still tired. she is tired a lot these days, you know. she goes to the computer and looks to see if anyone has sent her a message since she's been away. nobody has. she looks at the clock, it is 7:04 pm. not to early, she thinks. the tv is on in the other room. she waits for the mother to leave. she thinks about what she has done today. and the day before. and what she will do tomorrow. her fingertips are numb, and she doesn't know why. she takes off her glasses and cleans them, taking longer than necessary. okay, here we go.  she can't feel her body. and neither can anyone else. because it's not there.
