I mistakenly admitted on Wednesday at Navs that I have never actually been to a night-club. I just don’t see what people see in them.  Most people are totally inebriated and totally out of it.  You can’t talk to anyone, get to know people, or chat to friends.  Drinks cost a fortune and taste disgusting.  Sometimes I do like dancing – if you are with a whole group of friends and its good music, but the rest of the time I just feel totally self-conscious and bored stiff!    Anyway my day today has actually been quite good. I got up at 8:00 which pleased me and then headed into town to do some jobs.  I got my friend’s birthday present, an insulated mug with a lid (for Spring Harvest – can’t have hot drinks around kids in case they spill) and I there was a sale on in my favourite outdoor shop and they had this camelbag thing – have you heard of them? They are like water holders – I have a platypus one, but I wanted to get an attachment tube so that you can leave it in your rucksack and drink out of it.  I wanted one for skiing and other stuff and they were on sale. I got one that comes in this handy rucksack thing – except got it home and the seal isn’t good and so it leaks!  Never mind I’ll take it back next week.  I had a nice wonder round the bookshop ( I LOVE books) which I don’t often get time to do as I’m normally in a mad rush round town getting everything done on my list.    Then I came back home did some bits and bobs and went to look after the kiddies.  We did some finger painting today!  I love it, we made a right mess which the kids loved and I ended up clearing up – but it was cool.  Ruth (who is 2) and I did some singing and piano playing too whilst Paul (who is 4) surfed online on the Tweenies website!  He is an amazing kid on the computer.  Stayed until bathtime and then headed home.    But the best news of the day……Rachel called me!!! YYYYIIIIIPPPPPEEEEEE!!! Just chatted about random, superficial stuff but was SO good to talk.  I said I would call her at the end of the week.  Although part of me is still cross I guess that she wouldn’t take ANY responsibility for what happened, I have decided that our friendship is worth more to me than that, so I want to move on.  Initially I think I felt stung by a wasp and so was scared to go back in, but I’m going to take the risk. Its not going to be like before but maybe, just maybe we can have something.  And I have other people now too, so its ok.  Hey  maybe  that is why I met you when I did Mel, so that all this with Rachel could happen and I would cope….. God works in mysterious and crazy ways!!  Am off to the Lickie hills tomorrow with some girls from my small group at Navs. I am taking Paul and Ruth too, to give Jo a bit of a break.  Feel bit bad about not including Hannah (who is 6) but she is at a birthday party, so hopefully she won’t mind too much. Think I might do something special with her next week, but can’t think what.  Ok Granny goggins is off to have her coco before heading to bed with her hot water bottle!
