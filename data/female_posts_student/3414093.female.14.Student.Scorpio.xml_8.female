And the power keeps going out cause its raining and what not, which means it might go off tonight and fuck up my alarm clock and then I will be late waking up.  I had this dream last night and there was this talent show at the school but it was held outside (in a field that is identical to the one at my dad's place...why do my dreams always end up there???) Jamie did this dance thinger with some other people to the song The Sad Robot by Lardpony...but it wasn't The Sad Robot...it had messed up pop, girly lyrics...which pissed me off tremendously.  And I told Khala that and she was like "No, they didn't rip off Lardpony, its the otehr way around" and then I got even more mad cause I love the song The Sad Robot...anyways, the whole thing was a little trivial, but I really like that song... urlLink  The Sad Robot   I wonder if that link thinger will work...meh...if it doesn't then go here:  urlLink http://www.lardpony.co.uk/music.html   Okay...anyways...lately I have felt like doing something creative but I'm not into working on  urlLink my book  so I considered making a comic but I' not all that good at drawing...but I started one anyways (What Happened Last Night, Starring: Sketchy Guy) but it isn't all that great...meh...  So I need something to do...Maybe I will start an e-zine...again...for liek the 80th time...speaking of zines I still haven't published  Superheroes Chased Butterflies Too...  which I really should do cuz its awesome!!!  Okay...so I guess I'll go make an e-zine...or something...argh! I hate weekends!!!  Chera
