There's no strategy, no better way you can go about doing maths other than  practising and practising and practising.     It's not like English, where you gotta read, enhance your vocab, get your grammar right and all that stuff. I'm starting to like Maths you know. Even though I'm still not up-to-standard for a good grade.. Now all I need is the determination. Hardwork pays.   I love the coloration. Blogger is getting better and better.   I like how the 5 of us are now. Peychee, Liying, Shavon, Veron and I. And I like how we love each other, help each other and care for each other. The magnitude of a true friendship outweighs the test of time and predicaments.  Sunshine fill my window, that's what you are.. My  shining star* =]
