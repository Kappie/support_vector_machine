Yup.....Ego sum fatua (I am stupid)  Somehow i wonder why all the other Chinese girls are smart and why I'm the only exception.  I really don't like being stupid.  Maybe I'm not like all the other Chinese girls.  Nooooooo....i don't want to be an outsider.  I'm not intelligent enough!  I can't even speak my own language for crying out loud.  the only language i excel at is English
