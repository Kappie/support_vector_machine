I think now is a really good time to quit with gas prices soaring and I really want to start walking and getting in shape because I have big plans for when I get done with school.  I have not had a cigarrtte since yesterday @1145 pm,  I have also not purchased any and I have turned down offers from "friends" to let me bum one.  It has been really hard but when I got gas I paid at the pump so I didnt have to go into the gas station.  The worst is driving in my car.  In the car is where I smoked the most.  But I downloaded a bunch of EMINEM rap and that keeps my mouth moving.  so my oral fixation is satisfied.  I guess.  the really nic ething is that my hair still smells like my favorite shampoo and my clothes still smell like fabric softener, not stale smoke.
