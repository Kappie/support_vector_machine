I've been there almost every week day for the past two weeks. Therefore, my lack of blogging has been made up by my play. It's a simple play. 10 minutes. It's gonna be stage read by BU seniors January 16th. Fun.  Believe it or not, a whole shitload of....shit...can happen over a two-week Maddie period. The stories I could tell....  Let's start with...my play:  PLAY TAKEN OUT   That's my play. Yup. I don't like it. I don't even have a title. Tell me if you have any suggestions.  I'll finish with the stories tonight. I gotta go to the class now.
