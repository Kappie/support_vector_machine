Her hair and her eyes stood out prominently from her fair features. And she sang beautifully at the bar where she worked, called The Spirit Cove. There were plenty of bar girls, but none of them as decent and beautiful as Raven. Some of them were jealous, of her talent and beauty, how she seemed to capture the whole room with her beautiful voice, like when the Sirens had lured men to capsize their ships on the rocks. Except, how she captured people’s attention into paradise.  There was a good reason for the bar girls to be jealous. Number one, she has a beautiful voice and looks to match. Number two; she had a decent job where she didn’t have to use her body to make money. Number three; she earned more money then them. Lee Ann, the most beautiful next to Raven, pouted her red lips towards Raven as she filled three mugs of beer for three ugly and leering men sitting on a table not far away. “Raven can keep a distance from them and I can’t.” she muttered to herself. She plunked the mugs unhappily into the tray and pushed in next to her home girl. “Erin, take theses to those fat bastards there.” She nodded her head to their direction. Erin shrugged and picked up the tray. She set the tray on the table and gave them their drinks. She eased the tray to her hip and held up her palm. One man slapped a generous fifty-dollar bill on her palm and smacked her buttocks. Erin rolled her eyes and walked back. “At least I didn’t get smacked for nothing." as she passed Lee Ann and deposited the note into the cashier.  Lee Ann laughed and snapped open her compact mirror and checked her image. Her cat-like features glared back at her as thoughts about her life spurned in her head. Being poor, no abilities unlike Raven, as she stole a look at the dark-haired song stress. Lousy job, low pay, and get leered and touched by those filthy men. She might as well work as a prostitute. At least that brought in big money. If only I could sing like Raven, she thought.   “Hey, Lee Ann!” shouted one of her bar girls, Miriam. “We’ve got a new girl!” Lee Ann slapped back the lid of her compact mirror and dropped it in her miniskirt pocket. A demure redhead stood before her. “Hi.” She greeted Lee Ann. “First day of work?” she asked. The redhead nodded. Lee Ann scrutinized her up and down. “What’s your name?” she asked. “Phoenix.” she replied. Lee Ann’s perfectly plucked eyebrow raised an arch. “Phoenix? What kind of a name is that?” The redhead looked at her. “My street name. I had it for quite some time. I also used it when I was working at the brothel.” Lee Ann was surprised. “You work as a prostitute?” Phoenix chewed her bottom lip. “Yeah. What’s the big deal? I was sold to those places since I was twelve. Can you believe it? I lost my chastity at the age of twelve. I wasn’t even a teenager yet.” Okay, thought Lee Ann. Her life’s worse. At least I’m clean. She smiled to herself. Then the laughter of the three ugly bastards broke into her thoughts. She turned behind to glare at them. Okay, maybe not that clean. A bit of gray won’t hurt right? “Alright.” Lee Ann said. “Miriam,” she told the blond standing a distance away. “Take Phoenix, and show her what to do, okay.” Miriam stepped forward and took Phoenix’s arm. “Yeah, alright.” The two of them walked to the storeroom. Lee Ann glanced at the stage. Raven wasn’t there anymore. “She must have knocked off. And we still have to entertain those ugly bastards here.” She muttered angrily to herself as she caught the three men having their hungry eyes all over her. She turned away and mopped the bar counter furiously.
