I've tried all morning to work out how to post this as a word file people can download but I have to admit defeat so I apologise for the long post! I'll put the rest of the details in a seperate posting to help ! Doing it this way also seems to have ruined the formatting but hope this makes sense. Email me if you want the list as a word document on email just in case!     Friends of Marsh Lane Fields Brainstorming Session Eton Manor Clubhouse, 27th July 2004  Many residents walk their dogs at the site. Concern about the dog waste bins, the prevalence of broken class and horse manure which make the site a poor comparison to Hackney marshes. The nature trails signs are broken but still advertised in borough programmes. Scouts use the site but don’t use the lower fields because of the horse manure.  We need wardens or a park keeper for the site. The Running Club is a community based athletics association but the back of the club is being used as a dumping ground for rubbish. In particular council has left old play equipment there which is encouraging flytipping.  The Running Club would be interested in participating in a trust to run their building and develop their facilities. Also working with local schools including George Mitchell, Lammas School and the SCORE project with regard to the new track at Ive Farm. LA Raiders interested in participating in a trust to run their building and develop their facilities. Looking to work with other partners at the site to develop a project for sports facilities.  Cyclists also use the facility but get attacked by the animals, concerned by horse manure, condition of pathways and inaccessibility of the Marsh Lane Bridge. Geese in particular a problem! Residents like the rural feeling of the area – like the open space and don’t want facility to be too formal or too ordered. Access to the bridge a key issue. Triangle of land – gas works land? Is it contaminated? Could it be reclaimed?  Access to the site difficult for the disabled because of uneven paths etc. Lammas School not using the site as much as they would like because of the poor condition of land e.g. horse manure, broken glass. Also had problems with animals entering school property! School plans to specialise in sports activities so may be interested in working with partners to develop facilities at site.  Walkers like the open area , the fact the site is relatively free of hedges and fences. Need to work with Lea Valley Partnership – should think about not just what is in Marsh Lane but how the area connects with surrounding areas.  Public toilets needed – both the running club and LA Raiders regularly asked to provide facilities by visiting public. Both clubs would be willing to maintain such a facility. Profile of the area poor- not very many people know about activities at area. Signs up still mention Afro-Caribbean centre.  Could link into the Marina ? Olympics planning will see the enclosure of the electricity pylons at Stratford – could we do the same? Any Friends group would need to work with other groups in the area. The gates need to be locked to stop people accessing the site and dumping rubbish. Schools who use the site such as Sybourn, St Josephs and Church Mead need traffic management and a turning space for cars dropping people off.  Decontamination of site, in particular the asbestos at the far end of the site and potential damage from the gas works. Could we have a land survey? SCORE project – what are the facility charges and how were they decided? What role does Ray who lives on the site have? what time does he have allocated to the maintenance of the site?  Long term maintenance of the site and a proper budget for this key to its future. The trees are being strangled and need attendance. Most of the broken glass and rubbish comes from football players on a Sunday – cleansing happens before matches rather than afterwards when problem is biggest.  management of grass needs to be better – need to fence off areas which are damaged to help grass to grow back.  Large events should pay for cleansing of area afterwards. Also local groups need to be told dates of these events in advance.  The wooden posts stopping cars entering the site are damaged – SCORE project replacing these?  Open Spaces group came up with ideas about the area and a possible Friends group but nothing seems to be happening – can we have an update on what they said and involve them in the discussions.
