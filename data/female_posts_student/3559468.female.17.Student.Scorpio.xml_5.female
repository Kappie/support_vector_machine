Tom's gorgeous, he others aren't bad either, but I'm guessing he'll be my favourite.  Now, The OC.  Sorry, but The OC is waaaaay more important than McFly..... Ok, of course there's the fact that channel 4 have been very naughty postponing The OC. But I'm over it, it'll just make the next episode more exciting! However funny it is that Ryan has only three expressions (brooding, shocked, blank), the real story is Seth, Anna, Summer. Seth, who I will marry someday (so what if he's fictional, has two great women on his hands. But who is right for him? I love Anna, and they're perfrct together. But, Summer! I think she may actual like him on a deeper level. Did you see her face when she'd just kissed that random on New Years? "You're not Seth Cohen." Today I want him with Summer, tomorrow, probably a different story!
