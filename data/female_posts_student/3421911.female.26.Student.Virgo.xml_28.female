When I say earthlings, I mean, Chris, Beth and of course,  moi .  This was our first gimmick together after all those years.  There was bound to be a lot of milestones.  All of them left undocumented, damnit.  Patrick showing up. Bels all made up and slutty.   Beth without her boyfriend.  Chris dancing.       We met at Camp White. Well, actually, Beth and Chris met up at Mcdo Araneta, where they were supposed to wait for me.  Unfortunately, my roommates had other plans and made me up.  They picked me up at Legarda where suspicious looking people were behind me.  I was terribly late and as a consequence I was gonna pay for cab fare.  I, who did not have money.  But I was so scared of getting picked up, either by really perverted strangers or by the cops for allegedly soliciting.  We met Patrick at Camp White.  I didn’t know until late that Camp White was gay territory, specifically, gay men.  I WASN'T GONNA GET LAID AGAIN, I KNEW IT.  I have never seen sooo many gay men in my entire life.  They were all flooding the dance floor.  Camp White was for fags and their hags, or if lucky, their dates.    We ordered beer and as usual, Patrick wouldn’t offer to pay the first round of beers. And he looked so masculine, or at least trying to appear masculine.  To think he was such a slut when I graduated.  Immediately you could see the 4V divide.  Beth was talking to Patrick, I was talking to Chris.  You could also tell that Beth was still so much in love with Patrick and his butch image aroused her to new heights. Then arrived Erwin, Patrick’s ex and Jay, Erwin’s friend whom according to Chris was Erwin’s new lover.  The plot thickens.  ( N. B.  this is why I don’t or haven’t written anything about my lovely friends.  I can’t stop laughing.  No, seriously, I love my friends.  Everything is just sooo telenovela, that’s all.  Particularly this episode.)   Chris told me that Patrick was still a virgin, according to Patrick, of course. So I had to ask.  And I had to whisper.  And I just had to hit the beer bottle by accident spilling SanMig Light on Erwin.  That was the first time I got a gay guy wet, literally. There’s always a first time for everything.  We went to the very crowded dance floor.  It was full of gay men and while the idea of gay men rubbing themselves against each other fascinated and excited me a little, I couldn't breathe.  besides,  walang career dito .  I told Chris we'd just meet him after the show or whatever.   I love gay men.  My closest friends are gay.  But a gay man and a bisexual don't mix so off to the gig site Beth and I went.  We learned later that Patrick ran off and left Chris in the sea of gay men alone.
