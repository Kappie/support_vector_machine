I just wanna feel whole again, I wanna feel you next to me...holding me, looking in my eyes, telling me everything is perfect and as long as I am with you nothing bad can ever happen...I feel lost, like I don't belong here anymore. Everything is different, it seems to have change. No matter what I do, I keep thinking about last weekend and how I loved every moment. Now that's all gone and I don't know what to do...I just want us to be together again and never have to say goodbye...   However far away I will always love you
