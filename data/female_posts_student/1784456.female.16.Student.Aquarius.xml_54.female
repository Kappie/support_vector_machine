Some one got here by typing in 'halloween costumes dirt cheap' on Yahoo. Scary thought huh? Well I changed the sub heading thingy to Ca me tuait! Hehe. Guess what that means. Oh, oh! I have a cool furry coat with pom poms! Wow! Well...I'm getting it for Christmas but we bought it and I'm actually going to get it! Stupid people in boot room! I want to buy this pair of shoes (like really really four weeks want to) and I need it in size nine. But I can't get it! :( They never have it in stock and the people at the boot room look down on you and it's scary in there... Mmm food. I haven't had any breakfast cause we're going out for dinner and I got up about half an hour ago! So at the moment I'm thinking about eating the computer... tempting thought... Wow. I really do have a boring life! Who did kill Mr Body any way? Err...my brothers locked himself in his room and he's listening to Lady smith black mambazo or something like that. Have fun with your life. Bubi.
