The fact that I'll be graduating next year still hasn't settled in yet.  Since my comp died, I've had a lot more time to myself. Good when reading. Bad when not. Like I've said before, I think too much.  I just realized... once I get my braces, I'll be the dorkiest girl in school. Hmm. Not like I care. Not like it matters.
