I can't  not  know them, either of them, i need to know mike especially, since we are so smiliar, and Geoff, it's really a comfortable thing. I've known him for a year now, and like he said, he is putting SO MUCH into this relationship, and i know he is. i know, that they both truely love me, and i also know that I'm Geoff's first love, as he was mine. But, the sparkle, no correction, the flame, that geoff put off, and put into me, is now a kindle. And, it is such a turn-on, to be able to talk to someone for hours, or should i say 3 months at a time... I just dont know. One of them is saying me or him me or him, the other is tellign me how he NEEDS ME. and it's overwhelming. It's overwheling to think that i mean so much to both of them, it's overwhelming to know that it's all on me, all my fault, all my doing that us 3 are hurting and being so stressed out over this. i want to end it all, but by taking another step or action, may cause another downfall, how can you know what's right?
