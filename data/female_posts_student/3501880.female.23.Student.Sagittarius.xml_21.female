After standing outside for 20 mins (having to watch the Beastmaster rock back and forth), my prof. informs us that we are conducting class in the clubhouse of a GOLF COURSE about 10 mins away. Of course, I am frightfully low on gas, so after speeding to quickly fill up and grab some MUCH NEEDED coffee, I drive around for 20 mins. trying find the place, and could not    I must be missing Utah lately, cause it has been on my mind lately. Possibly because I am still getting used to having a film of sweat because of this damned humidity. Never thought I would wish for my skin flaking off again.  If anyone is planning to move or visit Utah in the near future, be sure to check out the following survival tips.   Useful Phrases and Vocabulary    Oh My Heck : What the Fucking Hell!   Jesus Jammies : Mormon Underwear. Upon getting married or leaving for a mission, a person has their "endowments" taken out. This, in effect, means that they now have to wear the most disgusting and un-sexy pair of underwear, consisting of knee-length shorts and a t-shirt made of a filmy, synthetic fabric. Bra and underwear are worn OVER the garments. Rumor has it that garments feature a "love hole" so Mormons don't have to take them off to have sex or rather "make babies".   "You're a Special Spirit" : Usually said proclaimed by a girl who is dumping a guy and means to say that she wouldn't even with someone else's cooch.   Helpful Hints   1. If you are minority, avoid visiting Utah. People in Utah usually don't like to see anyone of a particular ethnicity other than white unless they are cleaning their houses or serving them food, and even then, they guard their purses/wallets a little more carefully.  2. Bring Extra Beer Money. The beer in Utah is watered down to 3.2% alcohol.  3. Refrain from swearing in public unless you like being scowled at by strangers.  4. Be sure to take pictures of hoardes of polygamist women. You can identify them, because they are the ones wearing long, frumpy skirts with tapered jeans underneath and hair tightly wound in buns. They like to hang out at the DMV or other bureaucratic institutions for some unknown reason.  5. Watch out for the following interaction: You: Oh, Jesus Christ! Them: Where?  6. Sundays are the best days for shopping and hitting the malls...everyone is in church.  7. Beware of the screaming children. Utah Law requires that each public establishment must have at least one misbehaving child on the premises at ALL times.  8. Go to the Mormon Temple Visitors Center to check out the oversized Jesus statute. For some reason, it reminds me of the Jesus statute in  Dogma  giving the thumbs-up!
