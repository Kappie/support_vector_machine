A Violin... an Acoustic... am acoustic base... a piano... and a crazy half-insane inde-drummer - playing my messed up stoner music.  It's the formula for the perfect band. Now not every instrument would be in every song, hence the idea that someone plays more then one instrument... probably the pianist would also play the violin or something. I dunno. This is something I am enbarking on, but it will take proabably a year before this all pulls together. I have the music for all the different music parts planned out alright, but not the knowhow to coordinate that many instruments all at once and make it sound like love .... cause the idea is to make these imaginary people play exactly whats in my head. I have to *show* them what im thinking.   I'm taking piano lessons, guitar lessons, and vocal lessons. Holy shizniz, could it be real? Could this be happening? Me willingly seeking out knowlage? I'm taking music theory at clark this year as well as ear training, and im going to become really good at writing staff.  Oh yeah, and I'm writing a novel on the side.   But thats secret! Even more secret!
