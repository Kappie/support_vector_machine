It was very helpful to me . . .helped me to find an inner peace that I've always had, but never knew was there . . .I take that back . . .i've always known it was there . .I'd catch glimpses of it on beautiful days when the sun is shining, casting a golden glow over the earth . . . but it always left me before . . .   I think I have found now, the joy that my pastor always speaks of . . . one that is always there, through s adness, joy prevails . . . I'm not one to go into these things easily . . . as a matter of fact I am just the opposite, stubborn in my views, but i find it incredible, the peace i feel now . . .  I had a turbulent evening . . . but the joy was there . . . Even when i was angry to the point of shouting a whisper as soft as a light breezed kissed my ear, and i knew everything would be okay, and it is . . .
