Josh...you're kinda, um, over-protective and yes, it is comforting every now and then but do NOT turn into the parents that everyone hates.  Amusing Story about over-protectiveness: This 4th the Chinese peeps gathered and had a little dinner thingy. Whenever my mom gathers with other moms it's like lets-talk-about-children time and it sucks because the children are in the next room and we can hear them. Anyway, every gathering starts with a "I can't believe how Rosie has grown" comment and this time it led to my protection and how I need to make sure that I have "good" friends, basicly how not to get raped. @.@ Some meddling mother suggests pepper spray keychains for when I get my car keys so of course my mom is estatic about it and wants to get one for me. *groan* It gets BETTER. Xi, you all know him, of course shows his face right then and overhears about the wonderful keychain and starts cracking up, I got him back though. I nailed him with a pillow (I wonder where I got aim) and he spilled his sprite all over himself. It was great, his yelp was classic. =) BTW, the Keychain thing will NEVER happen so I DON'T want to hear about it outside of this blog. thanks  Byebye, Rosie
