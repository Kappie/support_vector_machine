So yeah. Today has been one whirl-wind of a day, in all aspects. Busy, busy, what with Ofsted Inspectors lurking in corridors and stuff, plus I am trying to work out with my head of 6th form what to take up instead of geography, or whether to bother at all, so I've just phoned about 20 different unis to ask their advice, and I got to go and have a meeting with Mr Butterworth tomorrow morning to dicuss more.
