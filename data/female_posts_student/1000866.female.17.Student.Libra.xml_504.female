I'm glad I called him tonight, and we talked for a little bit after we decided so, it just proves that things can be ok with us. I really believe we can go back to being friends. Honestly, I don't feel a bit awkward. I feel better than I have in ten days. I just kind of wished this would have happened before I went to Italy but...it's ok.   It's actually...ok.
