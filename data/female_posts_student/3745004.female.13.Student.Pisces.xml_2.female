We could collaborate on it, that would be cool ^^)) Currents of warm air swell and gather underneath your ebony-furred wings, pushing you up, up, higher and higher in a spiraling motion until you think you shall faint from the height. Meaningless patterns of light dance on the inside of your eyes, a fireworks show only for you. You cough. Again and again you try to purge your throat of the sticky-sweet smoke, but it clings to your windpipe like molasses. Your mind starts to becoming weak, driven by the need for clean air it throws its last reserve of energy to your new wings, flapping madly to send you shooting out of the foul, odorous cloud. You break through. There it is- clean air! It seems like a miracle to you as you gleefully inhale the crisp, cold evening atmosphere. But something's not right.. your tongue runs along the top of your mouth before passing along your two canine teeth.. a salty substance trickles from the cut caused by the needle-like point of your tooth. And as the blood flows over your tongue your mind is sent into a frenzy. That was it.. you needed it! Blood! You craved it, you lusted for it, HAD to have it. It was your source of energy.. this newfound realization terrified the corner of your brain still conscious. But soon your mind is captivated by the lusting presence inside of you. Forgetting the forest, forgetting the flames, the corpses, the curse, you beat the air. Wind streams past your face as you cut through the air toward where your instincts told you blood was. Where humans were.. where there would be people to provide you with your means to live.. that is what you longed for. For now, you were not human but a creature of shadow, a vampire..
