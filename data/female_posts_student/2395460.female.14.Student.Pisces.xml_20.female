It's actually been a little bit of a problem for me because I carry a toothbrush, brush vigorously in some mirrorless little public bathroom and end up with toothpaste foam stains on my shirt for the rest of the day.  urlLink Oral-B  had people like me in mind. The new  urlLink Brush Up  disposable toothbrushes are textured teeth wipes that fit over your finger like a giant paper thimble. It's coated with a non-foaming mint-flavored cleanser that freshens like mouthwash. They've been making these for dogs for years but always in bacon or chicken flavor.   I do like those teeth-cleaning gums like  urlLink Orbit , but if chewing a piece really gives you a "just-brushed clean feeling", then I don't want to look into the mouths of those people working at Wrigley. Brushing your teeth 12-13 times a day is time-consuming, sure, but I've never had a cavity. I kid, it's really more like 6 times a day, perfectly normal, maybe just on the high side of normal, don't you think?  Well anyway, these Brush Ups really do curb my urge to run to my  urlLink Oral-B 7000 Power Brush . The paper is tough enough not to fall apart in your mouth, but still gentle on your gums, and the textured little nubs really scrub away the fuzzy plaque that starts to build up  seconds  after your last brushing. The only problem I see with these is that they are about $3 for a package of 12 individually wrapped little wipes. That's like a day's supply. Where's the economy sized box?
