IDK! and i dont understand. crying liek that, has to come from somewhere, not no where. but i have this hole, but what from!!??...why should i feel empty. i feel over burdened too. but its all nothing....IDK!  if i had a kicking bag today it would have been put to good use. i locked myself in my bathroom and was kicking and hitting my counter. it didnt even hurt, i was in a masacistic mood or something. i'm numb.  we had our christmas concert tonight... mde me happy, - yes, i'm that low... but region tryouts are this friday, so i'll be terrified and stressed all over again. GAA!!!!!!! and...i just made it worse. and when will i learn to keep my fucking mouth shut. i wan tot go to sleep, but i will probably be up all night killing myself. but i wont die. oh no, god isnt that nice.
