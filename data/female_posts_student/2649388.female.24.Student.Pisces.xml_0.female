Mystery Man: "u there???" (I paused, thinking hard, trying to figure out who this is ... he sounded like he knows me.  So I responded, with hesitation ...)  Me: "Hey ... who is this?" Mystery Man: "David Lin..."   (err .. ok. THAT did not help much ... so I took a wild guess.)  Me: "from Helicomm?"  (David from Helicomm, DON'T laugh when you see this blog. I swear, at that time, I did NOT remember your last name ... and u know, I thought u were the ONLY David that I know whom I  keep in touch with =P)  "no...  r u in Boston???"   (Gosh WHO IS THIS GUY??? He knows me! I was a bit freaked at this point, and I seriously didn't think I knew him.)  "err .. yeah ... I m so so so so sorry.  Have we met?"  (Being a bit freaked out, I still kept my manner under relative control.)  "urrr....  how about this: Christmas Party...."  Oh My God ... So I DO know him after all. *awkward* I felt sooo stupid/embarrassed at that moment.  He is my mom's co-worker's son (yeah, long chain), and I see him basically once a year, at my mom's boss' Xmas party.  This year, we happened to sit at the same table, next to each other, so we chatted.  U know, the usual *social* conversation ... he asked me how's Boston and how I like MIT; in response, I asked how's work, and then somehow the topic got into the bad economy and the out-sourcing problem among engineering jobs ...  Then at the end of the party, he asked for my contact info.  With my dear mother on the side, I didn't want to be rude, so I gave it to him.    During Xmas eve, he actually called, and left a message saying "Merry Christmas" (I didn't pick up.) So I was like, ok .. that's very nice of him.  Merry Christmas to u too. Knowing that he called, my dear mother started to nag at me, about how I should call back because it would be rude if I don't, and that he is her friend's son ... yada yada yada.  To get my mother off my back, I told her that I would call back and say happy new year on New Year's Eve.   Well ... I didn't call (suffering from temporary amnesia).  What do you know, after New Year is over, my mom actually remembered -- She specifically asked if I called back.  Err ......................... NO.    Of course, my honesty earned me nothing but another lecture.   O.K.  So I promise, I will email him *sometime* in the future when I get back to Boston.   Well ... obviously, I haven't yet (my temporary amnesia is acting up again).  I have completely forgotten about what I promised to my mother ... Furthermore, my promise is not the only thing that I forgot, I also forgot his name and the fact that I gave him my ICQ. =P  That was my little awkward moment of the day. I added him into my ICQ list, as "mom's friend's son" ... so hopefully I will remember him next time if he ever pops up again.
