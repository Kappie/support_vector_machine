THE BEST ROLLERCOASTER EVER!!!! man, it was awesome! haha did i mention how much i LOVE that rollercoaster? yea so then we all played the water race thing, and i won but i gave my prize 2 abi's friend cuz she was the only one who hadnt won nething.  yea, then we stopped in the gift shop, then headed home. omg! we stopped on the way home at KFC, and it was so gross and my twister was all broken cuz the wrap was so old and stale! yea it was really nasty! then i got home and realized that someone had wrecked my puzzle! so i spent like a half hour fixing it. but those were the only 2 things that really went wrong 2day. other than that it was a pretty awesome day! and im definitely doin it 4 my b-day again! and this time mayb tony can come. haha but dont worry, i wont make u go on ne rollercoasters cuz i know how scared u r! haha, just joking. but october is fright fest, so there will b other stuff there, fun stuff! like ppl running after u w/ chain saws! man, im still recovering from last year lol. that is a blast! then of course, the sky coaster but i dont think tony would do that with me either! :-( so i guess id have 2 bring either tiffany or irina just so i'd have some1 2 do that with so i wouldnt have 2 do it alone. cuz that IS scary! haha the first time i did it i did it alone, and i was so scared! then the second time, i did it with rachael and it wasnt much better cuz she was really scared lol. but its soooooo much fun! haha she loved it once it started! so yea, fun stuff! u should do it with me tony! but neway, im gonna go now cuz tony left and no1 is talkin 2 me. mayb ill work on my puzzle 4 a bit b4 bed. haha its still early... kinda lol
