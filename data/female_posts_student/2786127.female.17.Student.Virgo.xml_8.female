So, I'm leaving it there. It gives my car a little special "somethin" anyways.   Back up...  So yes this is what matt did to ask me to prom. Completely filled up my car with balloons candy and confetti while i was in school today. I knew something was going to go down with my car because staci had to steal my keys...and I wasn't supposed to know "what for", but...you know. why else. Makenzie and lindsay and I dreamed of all the things he could be doing to my car all day in school. Our favorite happened to be the way he would ask me to marry him, because he's "clearly in love with me" so makenzie says. He would write "just married" on my car window and underneath the balloons a priest would be hiding and when I opened my car *surprise* He'd jump out and marry us there on the spot. What we found most amusing about this was how long could the priest *really* last in the car? We thought it would be funnier if we found the priest dead under the balloons. HAHA....how morbid.  I need to go to grassroots...volleyball...stupid.   its just easy cheese beansta- Makenzie
