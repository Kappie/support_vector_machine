I was debating with myself about the difference between XM Radio (the satellite crap), and the regular AM/FM radio.  Personally, I like AM/FM radio better. Why? it only costs as much as the radio u buy. 5 bucks can get you unlimited radio. XM... sh-t, costs and fees up the ass. So what if it's commercial free? Who cares? Commercials on normal radio keep the station alive and gives money to the station to improve their stuff.  Like for example, a local station here, KFNK, FunkyMonkey 104.9FM, they play about 6 minutes of commercials once every hour. why? because they have money from their commercials to do that. Just because XM is crystal clear stuff, the added static (in certain spots) of some stations adds to the fun of it. Who really wants 100 channels of PURE, CRISP crap when if you wanted sports and weather, you can watch the d-mn TV?  It costs just as much to have an XM service from XMStaelliteRadio, Delphi, or Sirius, as it would to have satellite TV. wtf?  Comment on it if you want. I just think XM radio is stupid.
