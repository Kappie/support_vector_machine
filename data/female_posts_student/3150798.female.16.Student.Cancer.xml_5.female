He was such an immature wimp, but Orlando Bloom did a good job, even though it actually didn't turn out to be the biggest role. Sean Bean did great as Odysseus, too.   Guys aside though, it was a really great movie. There actually wasn't too much completely disgusting violence, not as much as I expected at least. I mean, it freaked me out, but I'm extra squeamish about blood. And the sex scenes were pretty intense. So just close your eyes. But go see it for yourself- it's almost worth the seven dollar movie ticket!
