Because some people may be curious about what it truly means to have a boring life.  6:50 AM: I awoke to my mom opening my door. I jumped up, looked at the clock, and started to panic. I usally get up at 4:30 to catch the bus at 6:20. School starts at 7:15. I dash to the shower.  7:05 AM: After halfway blow-drying my hair, I jump into the van and my mom begans speeding towards the school as I try to slap some make-up on and put my hair up so I don't look too scary when I arrive at school with my first-ever tardy.  7:18 AM: I run across campus and sneak into the gym. My PE teacher doesn't see me- my perfect attendance is safe.  7:30 AM: We began doing yoga-style stretches. I believe the woman instructing us said something to the effect of: "Relax your muscles and sway...pretend you are a jellyfish..." It was hard not to crack up. Luckily, we got R since it was Friday. In addition to over 2 hours extra sleep, I got a 45-minute nap. Life is good.  8:53 AM: Head to 2nd period. Had to stop and turn in a late assignment in algebra. I was supposed to turn it in after school yesterday, but I was running late and would have missed my bus. My teacher didn't sympathize with that. As I tried my best to apologize, she just snapped a "Yeah" at me. I ran along to my 2nd period. We had a sub, and just busywork to do. And then I sat and took apart all my pens and put them back together. It was a lot of fun.  10:30 AM: I have to go to my algebra class for three minutes before I head to lunch. I avoid looking at the teacher. Did I mention she was scary...?  Because of the rush this mrning, I forgot all my lunch money. Didn't even have a dime to get ice water. And my stomach was grumbly. I really need to stop turning my alarm off in my sleep...  11:10 AM: My algebra teacher lectured us about paying attention and using the right methods to solve our problems. She was looking straight at me. Oh, how I wanted to raise my hand and inform her that she was being obvious enough. She could go ahead and call me by name.  12:40 PM: I love 4th block, Physical Science. We don't have to do anything- it's an automatic A as long as you appear to be paying attention. It gets kind of boring sometimes, but it is a huge relief after algebra.  Today we had 17 problems, and the whole class period to do them. Gosh, I love that class.   2:15 PM: School is finally out. As we are walking down the hall, the janitor's cell phone starts to ring, and a boy behind me starts calling, very loudly, "Hey, REBEKAH, is that your CELL PHONE I hear? I think your CELL PHONE is ringing." Yeah, so it's against school policy to have cell phones on campus. I could have killed him.  3:00 PM: I finally get home on the bus. It's pouring outside, so I rush to the door, only to find it locked and no one home. And I have no key. After calling my mom, who was 3 hours away, and trying every door, I end up popping a window screen out and managing to pry the window open. I was born to be a burglar.  3:30-9:45 PM: Basically, I've done nothing. I've watched tv and chatted on the computer. That's about it.
