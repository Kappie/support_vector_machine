They turned out amazing, golden brown - zero burned product. I only made 24 though, I should probably reconsider making a few more. Wait, I need to buy flour first.  Not too much else is going on today. I managed to get a lesson in my Science course done, and made some dinner/movie plans with a neighbour.  Cleaned my apartment top to bottom yesterday. Yeah, original Martha Stewart right here --
