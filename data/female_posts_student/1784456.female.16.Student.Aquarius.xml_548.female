Oh my god, episode II was soo soooooo good! I'm still in shock from seeing it, it was truly admazing. You guys have to see it, it's not just good its really clever and everything, but I will try very hard not to reveal any of the plot - but yes! Kidnapp Laura! Gag her and put her in a.. in a.. uh - a sack! With uh.. handcuffs - anything!!  Have you seen the Esso boycott? There were greenpeace people putting up signs saying "Dont buy from Esso" etc, and handing out anti-Esso leaflets, which I was reading and finding out how evil Esso actually are. Brendan got a badge from them saying "I don't buy from Esso" ! Yeah... he buys from Shell instead!
