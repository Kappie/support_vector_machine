My sister has her two friends over, and they drove to BlockBusters, and my dad drove off because he had to run a few more erinds, and that he would be home when they would.   They got Secret Window... I'm to scared to watch it right now...   On their way home, some guy just stole my sister's purse! They were walking, and he just stole it! Ashliegh chased after him, and was about two inches from catching him when she used her head incase he had a gun, and well, she was in the middle of the street... so... But that purse had our house keys and car keys and one dollar, our blockbuster card... and did I menton our HOUSE KEYS?! Now some phyco teen can just waltz right in here!  I'm so stressed and scared right now... first my first car accident, and in the same week, we're robbed. TT_TT I am soo scared! Gardian Angels... where are you now?
