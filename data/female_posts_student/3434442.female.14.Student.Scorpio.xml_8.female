We were sitting on the bench for 2 hours when the music acctually stopped and we had to go.  He and his mom and his little brother (they were walking ahead of us a little bit) walked me to my car, so lennon gained another ounce of respect from my day (YAY). and get this.  DAD OFFERED HIM A RIDE HOME!!!!!! it was awesome. i came home and considered getting online, but decided not to (sorry josh) and went to bed, only to lay there and watch tv from 12am-1am, watching old reruns of courage the cowardly dog. before mine and lennons star counting, we walked around with Don and Nick for a while and watched don drink the cheap $2.46 a bottle Boones Farm Mountain Berry Wine. Lol. he tried to get lennon to take a drink of it (it was in an ibc root beer bottle, not the original) and good for him he didnt, then i grabbed the bottle and sniffed it and immediately recognized the scent (lol what does that tell you about me?).  then later don asked me if i had ever heard of smirnoff or knew what it was and i was juts like "no don, im just a dumb ass."  then we were following don and nick and they started going to where i wasnt supposed to be so me and lennon turned back and they just kept walking on and on and on. im not sure if they even realized we were gone... very very very entertaining night.  i was so happy at the end of it all though!!! hee hee *dances* i wanted to kiss lennon so0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o bad last night, and had the perfect oppurtunity to do so too, but naturally, i chickened out and didnt.  his lips were right there! and so were mine! dang it! why do us humans have to get so nervous at times? well im gonna quit writing now. see ya!
