There's just nothing I want to do less after a day of writing notes, typing notes, reading 80+ pages of material, writing briefs of said material, etc. than coming home and cracking open another book.  Thankfully, I've been able to replenish my reading-for-fun reserves on break.    Well, the library is ruining me for things, too.  Namely, alphabetizing.  Before this summer's projects of finding empty holdings via lists and lists of call numbers, I knew P came before Q in the line-up.  Likewise, I knew the call numbers P24 and P25 came before PE25.  But no longer.  Now L comes before K and SH sometimes passes for SE.    At least my day is almost over.  Have precisely 18 minutes left and there's nothing, I repeat, nothing waiting to be done once I get home.  Textbook should be sitting at the doorstep, but that's it.  I have all night to wait for the phone and/or door bell to ring.  Yay.  Think I'll spend it either on the futon with Harry or online with the Gang.  Or maybe both...it's just that kind of night.
