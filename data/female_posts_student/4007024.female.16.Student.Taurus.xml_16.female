BLAH.. life sucks.  anyways tonight i went to the marshland festival with manda and  fallon and it was pretty fun.. a bunch of cowboys and hicks that stared me down. listen to this shit.. me manda and fal walked past this group of guys and this one guy was like 1 pussy 2 pussy 3 pussy.. i was like you are freaking disgusting dude. i mean honestly who freaking does that? well then we went to ross's little camp out thing to just hang out.. and i reunited with my best friend who's freaking awesome ( scotttttt ) we haven't talked in a while so it was quite nice. and i got to see a lot of old friends.  then me and fal hauled ass through wal-mart to get poker chips for my mom and we had to be home at 1230 for fal to call her mom b/c her mom said she couldn't go to walmart that late at night.. ha it was hilarious. and these guys were like dude what are yall on? and i was like i'm in a hurry and i asked them where the poker chips were and they were like well i know where the lay chips are.. i was like bitch i'm not high i don't have the munchies. god. people these days!!!!  i have insomnia AGAIN. i like can't sleep or something.. i used to sleep ALLLL the time. well not anymore.. something is wrong with me. BLAH  i'm going do something else. i've said all i want to say. :o) lattttterrrr.
