That like "How's chem going?" conversation thurs at lunch was some kinda miracle cure to my sadness.  On Friday I was worried about my Chem quiz but it certainly went way better than I thought it would.  Oh goodness I just got one of those calls again - you know the ones where they think they got the wrong number but they sound like someone you know.  Man that totally freaks me out and it usually happens when I am at my comp typing around like the same time!!!  I got a call like that once last year, and I could have sworn it sounded like one of my teachers..like way TOOOOOO freaky!  And well the one I just got kinda sounded like my science teacher from last year but it probably wasn't cause well chances of her getting the wrong # and calling me - ok yeah that just would not happen cause chances are too slim.  Man I think she has had to big of an influence on me.  LOL.  But well she is like the BIGGEST role model in the world and I would kill to be like her.  She has the ideal job, two kids, married, smart, pretty....everything I have always wanted.  But well yeah I am sure I will have it all some day too and someone will probably wish to be me.  Anyway yeah I am feeling really happy and good and stuff.  I feel really happy.  That's a change from the norm feeling of grade 11.  Also I am like not a big reader at all but Sarah and Ali both read this book called "Speak" and said it was real good.  And if anyone knows me they know that I would NEVER read any books outside school, I think I started one once or twice but I never finish them.  But I bought this book "speak" on Friday - that's right *I* bought a book (yeah the world might end) LOL and I am already half way throught.  It is SOOO good.  It totally relates to teenage life and like the whole time reading it I was like "Ya this author sure knows what teens go through cause she hit it dead on with just about everything!"  So yeah I want to finish the book soon cause it is sooo good...and I think I wanna read another one after this.  What is wrong with me?!?!?!?!...AHHHHH I am interested in books now..ok that is just way too strange!!!!
