Bath and Body Works has a new car fragrance system that uses their trademark clean, light scents like Cucumber Melon and Mango Mandarin. The brushed silver AutoFresh unit clips onto your car's air vents and the unit's own vents can be adjusted to increase/decrease the amount of fragrance dispersed into the air. I found Coconut Lime to be disturbingly strong and fake-smelling, but Fresh Linen is soft and unobtrusive.    If you're on Atkins, the fruity choices at Bath and Body Works may not appeal to you. You might prefer the savory scent of barbecue in the  urlLink T-bone Air Freshener .
