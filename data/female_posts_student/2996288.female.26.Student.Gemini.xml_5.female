As long as you don't count the random mumbling I do to myself as I do practice test questions - who knows what I say at those times!  It really is amazing how isolated one can be - even while out doing things.  I had breakfast at Panera, coffee at Starbucks, went to the Y for yoga, and then to Qdoba for dinner.  Beyond placing my orders and saying 'namaste' at the end of yoga - I don't think I've said ANYthing else.  If you've never met me, you wouldn't realize what a large statement this is.  I talk.  I talk a lot.  In my sleep, during movies, during church, at the dentist...  I'm just amazed that I could and did make it through a day without saying many words.    I've actually thought it would be a fun challenge for myself - to see if I could go a whole day without talking.  I never thought I could, but I've got a renewed faith in myself now.  Down with talking!!!  I always used to challenge myself to do things when I was a kid.  I'd decide to be blind and go everywhere in the house with my eyes closed.  Another of my favorites was to pretend I didn't have knees.  (I'm really quite adept at getting up and down stairs without bending my knees as a result!)  Or I would sing everything, and it would have to rhyme.  Odd behavior?  Perhaps.  Fun?  Definitely.  I recommend that you all try it: close your eyes and straighten those legs and go have fun!
