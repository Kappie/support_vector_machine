But please Lord extend me some compassion. I need your help. i can't function anymore. I'm soo tired of being sad. and hurt, and confused. Please Lord give me a chance to regain what i once had. Please Lord give us a second chance. I promise to be a better person, an diI know for the last 6 months I've tried really hard to be. Please Lord, help me. I miss my munchkins and my lovely boy. I need them more than anything and iI dont want ot live without them in my life. So if you can please find the time amongst the other million prayers (and i truly believe that there are more important ones than mine) to help heal my heart and intervene between me and him and help us regain our strength to be the couple we once wore. thank you Lord for all the blessings that I have recieved in my life, and for teaching me the biggest lesson: never take anything/anyone for granted. Thank you, Lord.
