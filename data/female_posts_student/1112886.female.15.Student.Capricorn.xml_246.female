They say, No, it's fine. I say, in that case, can I go to conditioning at school to get in shape. They say, No, to far away. I say, it's as far as the library. They say, It's out of the question. Can't you find something to do this summer? I say, I kind of just suggested one. They say, Wouldn't the library be nicer? I say, Wouldn't you guys just be better off telling me I have no choice than pretending to give me one? They say, Clean your room. (This is obviously they're way of telling me that I'm right without acknowledging my argument powers.)   Speaking of my argument powers. This was another topic for them to be anal about. They say, Gee, you're so talented at finding information and argueing a point. Wouldn't you like to be a lawyer? I say, No. I wouldn't like doing that everyday. I don't like the idea of arguing for someone who is guilty. They say, It makes money.  Doesn't the world revolve around money? Personnally, I'd rather not have anything to do with economics. This explains my being the only one in the family who is broke. I hate commercialized things. Nascar annoys me. Commercials annoy me. The only purpose I see for money is to spend it. I do not take pleasure in hoarding it, in counting it, in investing it. This bores me. I don't care for stocks. I see the sure way of becoming more successful in EARNING and therefore having the money. Stocks are risky and annoying as hell.  I think I was born into the wrong family. For example, my entire family consists of math nerds. Currently, I use my math book to smash unwanted bugs. This is handy. I see no other purpose in that goddam book. Do you really expect me to read it? I laugh in your face because you are obviously a twit. They say, Your room is messy. Clean it. I say, It's not messy, it's contaminated. I've been in school too long. They say, You're out of school. How can it be contaminated? I say (in my head, I'm already in trouble for not going to the library), School is a disease. The aftereffects continue as long as there is homework. I have general disdain for what they tell me. They say, Wake up in the morning. I say, It's cold in the morning. They say, Take out the trash. I say, It's cold outside. They say, take the trash out tomorrow morning. I say (again, in my head), Have you been listening to my part of the conversation? I'd rather not be out of bed in the morning. I'm jetlagged (it's been a year but I don't take jetlag well) and therefore must stay up until 2a.m. Is this so hard to understand? What is their problem? They can't see through their money, their own time, their own pleasures. I hardly know them.
