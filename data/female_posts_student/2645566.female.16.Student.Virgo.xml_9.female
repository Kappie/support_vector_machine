Everytime we are together we always end up tickling one another. He will say "HEY NOW!" and then I will chime in with it as well. So we were sitting around one day and he said "Hey now" and I said "hey nooow" like in the song. But we didn't know what song it was. Now we do. That's the story. You probably think it's stupid, but it means a lot to me.   Yesterday was...well, I don't know what it was exactly. In the morning, Paul and Chris came over and Chris watched Jordan while Paul, my mom and I went to Winchester to see The Passion of the Christ (the movie was indescribable; I can't believe one person would give up so much just to cleanse those yet to come...wow guys, wow.) After that was over we came home and had lunch. Then Paul went home and the rest of us *attempted* to go to M'boro. You see, we were gonna go get a prom dress for me (didn't work out) but my car kept dying on the freeway. My car sucks. So now my car is going to have to go to the shop and they will have it for who knows HOW long. And it really sucks being dependant on people for rides once you know what it's like to have that freedom. Suxors bigtime.  Today was a whole lotta nothin. Went to Donut Palace then to church. After church I went out to eat with Paul and his dad and little brother. That was interesting. It was also kinda sad because I don't get to see Paul until next weekend. *maybe* So that really stinks. I usually get to see him on Wednesday nights for a good 3 hours at least, but the stupid Colemans had to go and schedule concert festival forthat day. And it's just my luck that we wont get home until 10 or 10:30 AT NIGHT! Ugh...  So all in all...this weekend was interesting..boring..dull...gosh I hope I have a better week than I did weekend.
