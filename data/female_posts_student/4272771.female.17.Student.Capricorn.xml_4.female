I had not a care in the world there. It was right on the ocean and everyday we would walk down and go swimming in the clear blue ocean. And it literally was clear! I could see straight to the bottem. We played lots of pickle ball and Mere and I were super good! We made offical Wimbleton noices whenever we hit the ball. Unfortunatly one day we decided to go off roading in the golf cart and...my camera flew out somewhere and we lost it! Boo hoo because all these great pics were on it from the beginning of the trip. Towards the end of the trip we all went camping on this small island we took boats out too with all out tents and sleepover stuff including lots of fruit snacks! We slept in one big tent we had set up and he was very cozy! The night I laughed the most was the last night in which a few of the guys agreed for us girls to dress them up in our clothes! The pictures are pretty disturbing and great blackmail hehe. It was amazing how many shooting stars there were during the night. Everynight AJ and I just layed on the hammock and I eventually became jaded because there was probably a shooting star every 30 seconds...or less!
