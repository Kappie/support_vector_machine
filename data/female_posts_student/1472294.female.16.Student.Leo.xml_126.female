I mean, at least her english is very very good. She gets an A1 or A2, me? Hah! I got a C6, a passing grade. Damn... Ohhh, by the way, ES (Enrolment Shit) is at last over. But so so boring. We were in the chapel yesterday instead of the usual Sunday. And it WAS so boring. We sang, saw the colours, I mean colourful flags... And we ate. But the food was so urgghh, so I never eat much. I later went to PS but again so boring even with my friends... Today, my family and I went to Yum Cha. BUT the service was so bad that after eating a few plates, we went to a coffee shop and enjoyed a cheaper and delicious dim sum. A word of caution, Yum Cha's food or service is not the best. My family and even my relatives said so... Now YOU know....
