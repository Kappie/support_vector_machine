"Thou shalt not murder." -What exactly does this statement entail?  All  war? Let me ask you a simple question. Will God command one to sin? Now let me answer. No, He will not. He cannot tempt any man with sin. So then, when God commanded the Israelites to attack various and numerous peoples, was it sin?  Was it murder? I understand those were different times/circumstances. War is war. So if you mean all war then we should talk. Perhaps that is something to think about.  I'd rather not discuss the current war too much. Makes me sick you see.  You also have an interesting outlook on persecution. -My thoughts. We don't need rights. We don't deserve rights, or freedoms of any sort. What we do deserve is death. However, Christ died to free us. Free us from sin, yes. But He also died to give us a life so that we might live for him. You claim the church flourishes under persecution. I agree. Christ is worth every bit of torture imagined and more. You say you do not desire freedoms. But freedoms are what we in America take for granted, because we have known nothing else. None of us understand what it means to be truly persecuted. Until we have been stripped of everything we have it isn't fair to those that are persecuted to say that we want what they have. In reality no one wants to be tortured. It is not on anyone's to-do list. Kids do not say, "I want to be tortured when I grow up." It is horribly sad that the Church grows more under communism and whatever else then it does when it is given freedom. America and every other religiously free country is a pit of lazy lukewarm Christians who eat their meals and forget to pray for the persecuted, forget to witness to their neighbor, and who do not attend church except for when it is convenient. Their Bible collects dust while over in China, each single page is treasured and books are collected after months. But do you recall the Pilgrims? What was their reason for starting up this fine country? Oh yeah, I do believe it was for freedom of religion. They were being persecuted. They did not like it. They moved. God was with them, and established America. Freedom of religion.  Also, I draw your attention to the Great awakening. Thousands were saved. Why? They were not being persecuted and were allowed to practice. Try that with the commies.  We do not need persecution. We need revival.  Sending missionaries is also a feat when they are not allowed into countries. Sending them requires freedoms. You do not need freedom to serve Christ, but God has set up these freedoms for the furtherance of His Word.   Again, all we deserve is death. Nothing is needed to serve the one who died in our place.    Freedom is a blessing.
