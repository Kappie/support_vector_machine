Man, Tony is one of those buddies who is there for me regardless of how estupid I act or what I*m going through. He*s one of the real friends. I got so pissed at my other "friend" earlier, Miriam. I really love Miriam and Nana a lot, but I hate how I always have to be the wrong one and how they always have to be correct when they*re not sometimes. Then I always get the blame for everything. They*re always taking eachothers side and no one ever takes my side exept for Tony. Man... Well, I*ll get to see him when I come back, I know... but I*ll miss him so much. We burly get to see eachother now, and now we won*t get to see eachother more. Sigh... well at least I got to see him yesterday. I had a lotta fun yesterday. Went to the La Macabrona band practice and I*m in. I*m playing the trumpet... so I*m gonna learn, and I*ma learn how to be the best trompeta player I can be. So then I went with the Drunk Skunks and woo! Drunk Skunks got to be on TV! Woo hoo! They did really good too... better than IV man. IV sucks! Estupid OC ska... HaHaHa =P But yeah... At least I got to see Tony yesterday and have lots of fun with him and the band(s). Sigh... :'(
