A relative called me this morning to see how I was and didn't recognize my voice on the phone.  Oh well, i was never that big of a fan of my healthy voice anyway.  So, where are we on the great countdown? 17 days I think.  I'm getting more and more excited, obviously.  But I wish I could fast forward to the part where I move in to my new apt.  I"m stoked about visiting friends in Toronto on the way up, but I"m slightly less excited about staying with a quasi relative for 5 nights after I arrive in Toronto.  I"m sure an amature psychologist could easily see its one of those social interaction things I have so much trouble with, but I"m just going to put it down to the fact that I haven't seen this quasi Aunt of mine since I was probably 11.  I will be disrupting her life for 5 nights, and on top of it, she is moving into a new house at the exact same time I will be there.  Stupid University of Calgary policy on not be able to move into apt res until Sept. 6th.  Argh.  But there really isn't anything I can do about it.  Hopefully I'll be too busy to spend any time under her feet.  I"ve got zoos to visit, books to buy, jobs to find.  How much free time can I actually have?   So, I've decieded to visit my folks at the summer home for a night on Thursday with a friend.  I'm very much a city person, but hell, even I need 24 hours of relative silence once and again.  Thankfully I'm not driving the hour or so it will take to get us there.  Although I"m the first to admit I don't have the greatest confidence in my friends driving either.  She may not have hit a house like me, but she has a bad habit of backing into things.  Oh, and surprise, surprise, I did see that cursed commerical after last night.  Thankfully, I recognized what it was before I was too tramatized.  Random question for today: do opposites really attract?
