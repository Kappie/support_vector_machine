I also had confirmation on saturday. i felt kind of dirty because i left early to get to the dance recital. but i know i just would have stressed myself out by sitting there waiting. so it was good. i had a voice solo during mass and my mom said i didn't do too shabby. yay! my sister also got to come see the festivities so that was good.  the saturday performance felt was very happy-go-lucky. everyone seemed good about the show and no major major mistakes. (stupid arms in climb) we've done it so many times it may as well be old hat. there was a cast party at Rochelle's. It was muy bueno; filled with food and laughs. we also cracked open Cranium and Rochelle and I won. wah ha ha. Plato was so jealous :P  on sunday i went out for brunch with my family and my sponsor Carrigan. She made me an awesome afgan. it's so pretty and it's light sage. yay! she also gave me a medallion blessed by the pope. i'm hoping to buy a necklace chain so i can wear it.  after the sunday show i went to a few receptions and gave them my best regards, followed by a cast party at Happy Hoe's. it wasn't so much fun at first just staring at the wall, but later i hung out with Plato, Helen, Rochelle, and Bonnie. We had a wonderful time carrying on and discussing the future etc. sadly i had to slip back into reality and go home and face another manic monday.  What's the matter with her, -Betso
