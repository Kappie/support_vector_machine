Busy 1.5 day weekend...Formal, a second dog, and watched my first football game (hey, I may not have been there but I had the best seat in the house with the new 60 inch widescreen tv that FINALLY arrived)...also skipped out on work and forgot about Ruach.  I'll elaborate more tommorrow...after all what is APES for?
