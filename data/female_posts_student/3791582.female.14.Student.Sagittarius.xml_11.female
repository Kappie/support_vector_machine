I’ve been going back to the first nights, and the big fights and those good times when it was just you and me. and I like to explore the good days and the bad, when we knew we had a face across the hall or a number we could call if the worst that could happen did. And yea, some words got thrown around and we got off cue every once in awhile but it was still a good show. And we all cried by moonlight and you messed up a few lines and we walked the quad a few times, just to clear our heads. so, summer will fix everything that we slipped. So, fall will come with suitcases and hugs. it won't matter how we left or if we said perfect goobyes, even goodbyes at all. we'll be back again.   all work © smokeycustard
