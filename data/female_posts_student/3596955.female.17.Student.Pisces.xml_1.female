'I'm sorry for 2004. And I ain't gonna mess up no more. This year. I'm gonna take this one chance. And make it real clear.'      That perfectly illustrates how I feel  act with what's left of the year. To live this one opportunity to attain my designated providence, fulfill the dreams of I and those I care about, to fulfil my expectations, grasp my potential - Let go  Let God. No regrets. No hesitations, repunctations, buts nor ifs. No silent echoes of Brian Mckight's - Shoulda Coulda Woulda.      'Should've been a better man. Could've been better off if I had done right by you. Could've done this, should've done that, but I know I can't go back. But now it's just too late. I'm saying shoulda, coulda, woulda.'     So HSC, I promise to be faithful, to let Go  let God, to be righteous, to live by you, to stay true to you, to care, to maintain, to protect, to grasp my potential, to exert all efforts for you. My HSC - this I pledge to you - I do.  hehehehehe :D  -- head hurts pow* --
