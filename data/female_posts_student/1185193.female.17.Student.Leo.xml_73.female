I just hope Scary Stocker Boy (name?) isn't working this year.  He constantly stares at me and is way too friendly.  This is the one who caught me going to my car one Sunday after church just to say hi.  He thinks my birthday is in May and that I went to Disneyland (?).  No clue why.  I'm hoping if I wear my hat and sunglasses he won't recognize me.  *crossed fingers*  Anyhoo, I'll report back tomorrow re: the first day.
