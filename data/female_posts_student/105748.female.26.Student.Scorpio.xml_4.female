Clubs  to here because hardly anyone ever visits the old club anyway.    By the way, we rented  Dude, Where's My Car?  yesterday and it's really retarded. It's a collage of all the stupid movies ever made. Think  Dumb and Dumber  meets  Half Baked  (two movies which I have never ever seen and refuse to see ~~ I really cannot believe that I let Brian talk me into watching this one) with a little bit of  Men in Black  and  Galaxy Quest  thrown in.
