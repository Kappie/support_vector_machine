I should not stereotype one person because of the history that one had no control of....I,myself have always been someone who does not like to have a strong first impression of someone......with the simple reason that what i see in superficial might not be what in depth.  The truth is yuko is an individual who knows more about Japan's occupation during WWII than most Japanese is my pleasure....imagine if i got some other ignorant japanese as my friend, my friendship probably wouldn't have gone this deep....Moreover the current Japan is like any other country with its new generation begining to generate a whole new different image.
