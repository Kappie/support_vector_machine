I as so tired. I was up till around 1 in the morning trying to convince my friend that we should still hang out. How odd is that? I mean she already goes off and says all this shit about me and how I am a bitching catholic and stuff like that. I'm about to give up. I mean why should I fight when she obviously wants nothing to do with me? I really don't want to lose a great friend but if they don't want you what are you to do? Nothing I guess...Well I am depressed now so I'm going to go take a nap or something.
