Or maybe it's just the archive system that brings out this unctuousness in people. Every time you go in, you have to sign your name, your permanent address (to track you down in case you make off with something?) your status, affiliation, and your topic. Before you go, you have to sign a sheet basically affirming that you're not going to plagiarize. Before I actually got out of the archive doors, I was asked when I'd be back. "Uh, I don't know," said I. The lady said that if I didn't show up they'd just send the paper back. "Monday," I offered. The lady made a face. "Ok, Friday." She still didn't seem so happy.  I wonder if Harvard looks up journals too...I remember BIOSIS was comparatively awesome last year at Davis. I'm wearing my Davis shirt today.  Yes, it's time to ponder about the name: Lever 2000. "For all your 2000 parts." First, what constitutes a "part?" If you take something like "torso," can you take it apart, like "bellybutton" and "stomach"? Do they count inner organs? Can't they count structures, then? And if you take a finger, can't you separate it into the finger proper, and then the cuticle, and then the nail? Is a joint a part? We know how many bones there are in the body, but parts?  Yeah, I should go off and do research now.
