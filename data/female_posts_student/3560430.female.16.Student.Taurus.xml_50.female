We had great games, added in one becasue we completed a couple of the games too quickly. I won Hot Potato, the only one I would be interested in winning as the prize for that game was a piggy bank, I have a slight love of piggy banks, I'm on fourteen now, although my purse obsession wins with seventeen.    The night before I worked on a pinata that ended up looking really good but really creepy to. I may post a picture later on when my dad loads it onto the computer. The birthday girl desimated it in three swings, blind folded.After the party Raven Beth and I had a sleep over, it was really nice because we haven't all been together to just talk for a long time. We fell asleep talking at about 3am and were lying across the bed width wise (is that how you say it?) We watched a really racey movie before hand called origional sin. Really good plot with lots of twists and character development as well as very hot sex. Definatly not a children's show!      I made food this morning and Raven was thrilled as she took her brand new CD player home with the AA betteries that I gave her and the Beetovan CD that I allowed her to borrow. Sunday should be great because we'll all be together again to hang out and go to the beach.       Today was rather odd as one of my brackets fell off while I ate a chip. Just POP, and it was off.       I have to say that aside from peculiare orthadontia goings on I only have one complaint about the last few days. And it's not even really a complaint. I saw a rather odd skin oddity on one of my friends that rather shocked, yet honoured me. For the first time in... Months (wow) I've seen her shoulders, well any of her skin that's not her hands, feet, or face, occasionally she would let us see her fore arms. This weekend I saw her shins shoulders, and parts that aren't unseamly to view. She had a word engraved on her shin, and many lines running down her legs and arms. I wasn't really suprised and I wasn't shocked, just a bit... Well I don't know what to call it. But I felt it. I feel very sad for her skin. It was nice to hang out though. Great water balloon fight (got wetter filling them then throwing them) and wonderful conversations. Over all a great night.       I must now contemplait what to do. I think I need to clean my room over the next few days, I will I swear (how often do I say that?). I also need to finish editing the Fraser part of my novel, and maybe help with the Taryne, I'm not sure if Beth wants to do it or not. I'll probably just clean up the living room and vaccume like my mother wanted me to. Sigh. I must do something... Although I probably won't.
