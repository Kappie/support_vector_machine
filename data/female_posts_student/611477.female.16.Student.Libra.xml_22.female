I can wait a day or two on that... I've been neglecting my tatting of late.  Nothing's leapt out at me "TAT ME!!!".  Well, just this afternoon a couple new patterns were posted by who must be the Goddess of Tatting.  (When I was first learning to tat I asked for basic help on one of the Yahoo groups and she gave me the clearest instructions.  Wasn't until a few weeks later I realised that I had been in the presence of genius.) So my current project...  urlLink Flamingo!  .  Mine must adore shrimp - using hot pink!
