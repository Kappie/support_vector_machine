I went straight to bed when I got home from Albert Park at about 9:30 and slept right through to 7:30.  Maybe I'm sleeping too much.  We were whipped at Div 2 last night.  We played the bottom of the ladder team, Be Afraid, and they started with only six on the field and had a maximum of seven players and they  still  beat us 15-1 (20-2 after we kept playing).  At least we had a better turn out that last week.  We had John, Barrie, Swany, Gus, Jez, Bart, Rob and Kosta and Jac, Liz, Cath and me and Suse came for support.  I made an awsome D in the second or third point and then ran on into the end zone and Bart threw the disc to me and I totally misread it.  I didn't throw a backhand all game except for dumping, but I was drilling my forehand and making some great catches.  I figured out that I shouldn't eat dinner before I go because I get a stitch, which is a massive pain because if I don't eat before hand I will be absolutely starving when I get home.  I was feeling better when I didn't get any subs after Liz pulled out with a "sore ankle" so John was making jokes about me having the build of an endurance athlete :)  I also had one other awesome cut into the endzone but the disc was out of reach and it ended up being a foul on the throw anyway.  My short cuts were pretty shit because I was to lazy to fake and the girls on the other team were really good and really fast.  They just never turned over the disc and we were being really slow to D, so that made them pretty invincible.  We have to deal with the Safety Audit today and separate all the irritants from the corrosives.  That is going to be loads of fun.  I sent an email to Lachie today advising him that I'm going to resign from the MUDC committee because I just don't have any time to supervise or even prepare for Socials anymore.  I don't think that they'll miss me cause I haven't had time for any of that stuff all year anyway :)
