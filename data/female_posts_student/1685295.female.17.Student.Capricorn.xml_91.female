Good grammer or not, I totally support the idea behind it...I know, I'm anti-patriotic too. Damn vain, stupid, statesmen, patriotic cheerleader girls. (Though "statesmen" and "stupid" is usually synonimous)  God almighty wants to kill me. I say, give it a shot, I dare you.  Anyway, some badass virus has been goin around, its a worm, and it's pretty bad. As is if stuff like tapeworms and other stuff in real life wasn't enough. Anyway, NT based comps are at risk, so if u have any of these (2000, NT, XP..that's all I think) and don't have the patch, go  urlLink here  to save yourself.  And I still hate U.S. patriotism. Thanx Dollface, for bringing such an enlightening quote to our attention.  I'm Deadiside and that's what came out when I pushed all these buttons.  "YOU'RE WASTING GOOD PASTRAMI!!!!"
