The clarinet section are stuck in their always present power struggles and disagreements we are like the only ones who dont respect one another and listen to each other its sad and really   annoying i mean just shoot me now! but yeah its gettin better i suppose i will survive! i still miss all of my favorite people! maybe ill talk about sandwiches this weekend or something.....sooo bye!
