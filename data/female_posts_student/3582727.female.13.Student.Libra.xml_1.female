Which is weird, because I've always regarded myself as somewhat unique, you know. Not at all like the average person. But I've just never really thought about it. Many people--maybe most people--are actually social, active people leading busy, eventful lives. People actually  do  things everyday. People actually have self-confidence and -esteem. People actually  like other people . People are actually  happy . I don't know why this is such an amazing realization for me. It just is. What a dumb revelation.   I wish I could live life like that.
