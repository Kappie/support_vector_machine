For us, I don’t think it is the best performance among all the practices we have had during this 2 months, not even better than the performance during the qualifying round.    I think we have to re-think the mistakes that we had made today.  Firstly, The seniors shouldn’t scold the juniors before the competition during the hair-setting time.  Secondly, The seniors do not give enough encouragement to the juniors (especially the Form / Form 2 juniors)  Thirdly, most of the members were not confident with themselves.  Hope all these mistakes would not occur again in future.    However, we have to accept the reality, we are the loser. We can’t deny that SMK Nan Hwa is really the best band in Perak. They are so proficient. The songs that they choose for the competition are very nice. I like the percussion of the school. They have good skills. Fantastic!! They are very friendly too. We took some photographs after the competition was over. The percussionist from both the school built up a good relationship after the competition. In fact, some of the percussionists have already known each other.    Finally the competition has over. However, I feel hardly to leave the band. I felt in love to the band since last 2 months. I like the juniors, I like the drums, I like my section, and I like the way in which we aim for something together. Time passed fast. Yesterday was my last formation practice in my whole life. =-(    It’s time to concentrate on study. The SPM trial is just around the corner. 1 month for it. I’ve to concentrate on my study from now onwards. No more practice and no more duties. All the activities have over. Add maths and Chemistry questions, I’m looking on you. =P
