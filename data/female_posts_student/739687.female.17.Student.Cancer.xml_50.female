Oh well, I almost got grounded this weekend, but I weaved my way out of it...so it's really not that bad. Ah, the joys of being an awesome debater with your parents...and an awesome suck-up. Actually, no, minus the suck up part. I suck at that. That's why I got grounded in the first place, because I wasn't sucking up, and I was speaking my mind a little more than I should have. I eventually told my parents that it was alllllll my fault, but I don't believe it. Meh. Being a stubborn person really SUCKS. But this time I took people's advice, and I stopped arguing and just let them have a victory for once. I think I have way way way too much pride for my own good. Oh well...I don't have a problem with it. You know, that right there is a major character problem, and a definite older-sibling trait. Gah, sometimes being the oldest really sucks. And sometimes it doesn't, in the cases where you can be as bossy n bitchy as you please. Well, if you have the heart to save me from my insanity, please call me. Thanks a ton.
