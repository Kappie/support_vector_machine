I have this great feeling that this week is going to rock.  I have absolutely no homework, and I won't have any for the rest of the week.  Plus, there's early release!  But DARN THE PEP RALLY.  The pep rally should just... go... away.    Not much else going on in my life- looking forward to Thanksgiving break and the beginning of a new tri (I'm so very sick of this one...).  If anybody has good ideas of stuff to do in this darn town that doesn't cost tons of money, let me know!  I'm tired of always doing the same old thing (watching a movie).  Cool song alert! (in honor of my sister): "Lindsay's Song" - Ten Shekel Shirt  Charles rocks :)
