The drunkplaced his bottle on the floor of the church, symbolizing that he gives up drinking, the criminal places his bandana down symbolizing that he gives up crime and the prostitue throws herself on the floor, symbolizing that she's gonna stop, well prostituning. Yay I'm so proud! I use to be so curios as to why the chick kept falling on the floor. and yes, Kayne West is my favorite rapper XD
