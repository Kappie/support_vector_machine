So reading it is! i just need to find the right book.   I wonder what will be on T.V tonight. Nothing good prolly. I wish someone would come whisk me away to A Makeover Story. Or better yet, I will invent a new reality show and it will have the same concept except it will make you over from the inside. You will see various shrinks, try different drugs, attend self-help seminars. And you won't be able to look in the mirror for the next three months. I'm sorry but those are the rules....  Its almost lunch time! And I'm starvin'.
