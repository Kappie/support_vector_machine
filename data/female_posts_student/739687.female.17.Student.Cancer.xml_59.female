"There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done And it sure feels good To finally feel the way I do I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you..."  Ahh...that song cheers me up. I like songs like that. I feel like re-posting a poem, because it's in my archive now, and not on my main page. So here it is...I like it because it's optimistic, and I like that:  I’m finally content and now I understand My life is becoming so clear It’s like I’m finally able to see the light On the path once carved in fear.  A burden has lifted from my tired back And this feeling is all so great I’m learning now I can trust and love Rather than loathe and hate.  I’ve taken my chances in the game of life I’ve bet everything I can And for a moment it seemed that I’d lost it all But now I’m winning again.  Now I stand in the dawn of a brand new day And I watch the sun rise with a smile The light bathes my soul, and uncovers a heart That I haven’t seen for a while.    And there you go. You know...the greatest feeling in the world is to feel all that is good. Not have to reminisce or think of everything going on...just to be. Just be. Soak up all that is beautiful around you in the most simplistic forms. I have a quote for that, but I can't find it. I'll post it later today. I have chores to do now.
