Is this why the continuation of the species is up to the female side of the human creature?  I know that I am stressed about school (that's a WHOLE different subject to be tackled at another time) and that I want to move (again, another topic. . . ) so starting a new relationship during this period of time is KIND OF A BIG DEAL TO ME.  Okay, he is basically done w/ his Ph.D. in Chemistry and understands going back to school.  Okay, I flat out asked him if we were "OK" and he said "Yeah!  Why wouldn't we be?"  which begs the question . . . why do I have this strange feeling something is up in Smallville?  Superman seems to be acting a bit strange . . .  Guys, help a sista out here.  If you make a BIG PASS at a girl about 2 weeks into the relationship and she says - "Um, yeah, . . . can that wait a bit so we can get to know each other better?" does this immedeately mean that you guys take it on the chin as some sort of insult?  I mean, he's gotten away w/ more than my average boyfriends have.  And maybe that's the problem.  I let him and now he may think I'm pulling back when, in fact, I am just putting some HEALTHY PERIMETERS around the whole situation.  "Relationships are not stressful" my ass.  At least I am going to NC for a few days so I can clear my head.  My friend, and sister of my heart, has asked me to join her to see her parental units in the mtns.  Ahhhh.  You hate to be single when all your friends are paired up but when you get yours . . . yeah, you REALLY GET YOURS.  And to top the evening off . . . an old "almost" boyfriend wanted to do something tonight too.  Damn, when it rains it pours.  But, again, there is the rain and then there are the flowers.  I'd better start focusing on the tulips and let the clouds just pass me by :).  And my boyfriend is very dear.   I lost the owners manual and don't know quite what to do with him now . . . Hmmmmm.  Maybe that's the problem.
