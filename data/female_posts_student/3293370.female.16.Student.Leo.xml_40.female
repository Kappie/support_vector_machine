I really would like for this year to be something else being as how all the rest of my years have been something else, in a completely different sense. I think it's time for my life to take a sudden turn and take me somewhere other than this depressing state of mind I've been in for the past few years. Oh well, I guess only time will tell.  I'm so tired.
