She wanted Bill to say goodnight to some guy on the internet for her, and Bill wouldn't because I IMed him and was upset. She didnt care that I was upset, just that she wasnt getting what she wanted. She's like "well you too were fighting anyway" (which we werent) but even if we were..she acts like because we were fighting Bill shouldnt care what's wrong with me. Its like...she's so bitchy. She goes to Bill "I'm not doing anything for you, I'm sick of it!" and he goes "then I'm not doing anything for you" and she said "what do you do for me?" and he does a lot of her...He does like anything that she wants him to do and its fucking bull shit. She's such a whore..she's not even a mother. I swear to god if I could let Bill live with me I would, because his mom is such a fucking bitch. I have NEVER known anyone as fucking bitchy as her. GOD! I wish that I could shoot her in the mother fucking head. AHHH! Because she didnt get her fucking way everything that I had planned today is fucked up. I didnt see him yesterday, and I can't see him tomorrow either. I fucking hate his family. It's so dumb because my mom does shit for me all the fucking time and doesnt expect anything back..but Bills mom WONT do anything for him unless he does something for her first. She's selfish...she doesn't know what a mother is. She should have been careful or something when she was having sex with his dad..because she should NOT have had children. My mom ALWAYS puts me before her. You will never see my mom going out and buying herself something unless she gets me something first. His mom...always gets herself stuff and lies to him and says that she has no money so that he can't get anything. It was storming one night and she's like "I have to get home, I have a baby..I can't die, I have to take care of him." and shit....but like, if it were my mom driving she would have said "I need to get you two home..I dont want you two riding around in this kind of weather"..anyway, I'll stop complaining. :( GOD i hate her. Errrrg...anyway, yeah..so I'll update later on I guess..
