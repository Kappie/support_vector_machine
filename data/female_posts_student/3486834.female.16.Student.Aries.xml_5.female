I can't do anything with Amanda tomorrow cause I have lunch with my grandmother and then my mom wants to go shopping.. again *sighs*.. i am almost sick of shopping.. That NEVER happens! Emily can't do anything cause she has an Art Camp or something. How lame can that get. I hope it's not the one with Ms. Flynn... accually to tell you the truth.. when I did that Art Camp w/ her I had a pretty good time.. Only because I got to help out with the kindergardeners and we got to swim a lot.. hehe.. Just cause I was special. Farrin is still out of town.. I think.. I still haven't seen her.. :(.. she is like the coolEST! I would go skating like I used to.. but I forgot my skates again.. I mean I am so bored that I thought about reading a book.. but it figures.. I forgot a book, too. Man life sucks! With all of this time doing nothing, I just think about the crappy things in life.. Gets pretty depressing. Oh and I didn't have nightmares last night.. YAY! I had a cool dream, but I don't have to tell you about that. It was just really really cool. lol. I am gunna go try to find something to occupy all of this useless time I have..
