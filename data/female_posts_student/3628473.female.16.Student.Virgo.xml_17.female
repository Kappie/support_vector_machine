And i dont know, it just might be. but i am thinking a different way. Where in the bible does it say your safed if you go to church every Sunday, and help out 3 times a week. and you read your bible 4 times a week. And you "pray" 2 a week. And you go to a bible study once a month... NO WHERE... James Chapter 2 says:  8Yes indeed, it is good when you truly obey our Lord's royal command found in the Scriptures: "Love your neighbor as yourself."[3] 9But if you pay special attention to the rich, you are committing a sin, for you are guilty of breaking that law. (NLT)  Now it says it is awesome. It is wonderful. But you still are saved even if you dont do all of Gods laws. Now i know that there is soooo much to go along with this. So much, i dont really want to sit here and type it all, (And it doesn't help i really want to go to sleep) But i was thinking about a song also... "Seeking you face and not only your hands" It took me a while to understand what the world the guy was saying. But i got it. His has helped save us. And so many are into the "I'm saved, lets go on our way" thing, and not looking for the face of Christ. Are they still saved? Heck yea they are! Does it upset you that you dont get to drink, have sex till your married, cruss, act out of angry, be jelouse, gossip, and so much more. And someone else does, but they are still going to go to heaven if they believe in there heart in this one thing? I know it upseted me like anything. Sadly i think i was told a lie. "When you get to heaven you get a crown. And the brighter the crown is, the better faith or whatever you had while you were here" Now if i was told this, i would throw up. That makes me sick to think that... Where in the bible does it say that? Can someone tell me please! At the time, when i was told this, i was happy. I was like good. I'm going to get a big yellow one, and its going to have dimions and hearts and everything on it... Now... i dont want a freakin crown. I shouldn't be just worshipping my God with my life, cause of the life afterwards... What would happen if there were no heaven? Would you still worship him? Would you still go after him with all your heart? Would you give him all your life, and all you have? Even when you knew there was no reward? Other then being with him... Would that be a big eoungh reward for you and me? I know its a lot of questions. And i know how i would like to answer. But i dont know what the truth is. Should we be worshipping like there is no after-life?
