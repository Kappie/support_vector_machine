The kids in Theatre3 that want to get into Theatre4 (directing) next year--me being one of them--are going to "get a taste of directing". G paired us up to direct 3 or so of the non-potential-Theatre4 students. I got paired up with Dillon. (Yay! Our thingy is going to rock!) ...But Corbin is one of the actors. (Damn, it is going to suck.) ....Corbin is such a fucking asshole..... (And he knows that I hate him; yet, he still acts really nice to me and hits on me. Fucking ass...)  Ok...Happy thoughts again....  Yay! Directing!! ...with Dillon!
