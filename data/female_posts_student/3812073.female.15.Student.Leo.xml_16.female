What kind of friend I want people to take me as, what do I want people to remember me as?  then yesterday, I was asked a question. What will the scenario of my funeral be? Will there be a lot of people? What will people speak of me when I'm gone?  and I realised the answers to my questions I've been questioning.  what about you? If I'm gone someday, what kind of person would you remember me as?
