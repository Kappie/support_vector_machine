Leah is being stalked by a crazy man who's heart is racing to say I love you and Miss Carolina is going to read up on her daily history quota that is now mathematically correct.  Oh my.  I am so tired and it is officially 8:28 at night.  This is pathetic too.  I really want some Valentine's cake that I baked yesterday.  It's even heart-shaped.  Woo hoo exciting.  I really wish I had something to do but I'm in that weird tired state that I don't want to do anything that takes much effort.
