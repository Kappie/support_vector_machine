I hate getting hurt because I always think that it's my fault. Maybe sometimes it is, but I put most of it on myself. I can't go through each day knowing that I hurt people or worse, that they hurt me. I hate the feeling of having nobody to really "belong" to out there. Not saying that I want to be loved that much, but I do really like to be considered as a good friend sometimes.       I never really actually tried to be somebody lovable. I'm not an easy person to love in the first place. I'm selfish and I am a real idiot most of the times. I have an ongoing pain for some reason most of the time too. Why can't I be a happy-go-lucky kind of person. I'd love to wake up one day and have some kind of meaning to my life. I hope that one day I'll finally wake up.   Wake up to some kind of light.   Some kind of shadow that will lead me to hope or faith or meaning.   I hope some day soon because I can't stand this nightmare.
