It was so funny, I almost choked. After lunch we walked around to the shops and such and ended up going to Brea mall. Checked out the puppies and looked at some clothes. And here I am passing time till work.  Feeling for the time being: I can only be myself, I'm sorry if that's hell for you, I guess you're lookin' for someone else...  And damnit HE NEVER LEAVES MY HEAD. WHY DO I THINK ABOUT HIM SO MUCH? ITS DISCUSTING!!!  P.S. Take me to the beach...
