I am avoiding this word because I have temporarily forgotten how to spell it.  Is it burned or burnt?  I could probably just check with the helpful little spell-check things, but that would make things much easier than they have any right to be. Besides. ...... Crap, I have no more reasons.  Alright, I'm just a brainless idiot, OH WELL.  Deal with it, becuase IT IS NOT CHANGING unless I decide to rule the world.  As of yet I have three friends (Paige, Erin, and Allison) who are intent upon this lofty aspiration, and I have no wish to contend with them over such a defective thing as Earth seems to be. Um, what else do I have to say?  Not a whole lot, really.  I watched Swordfish on Saturday (you know, with Hugh Jackman, John Travolta, and Halle Berry?) AAAAAAAHHHHHH TWO MINUTE BELL.  I will post later, hopefully during Health.  Okies, bye!
