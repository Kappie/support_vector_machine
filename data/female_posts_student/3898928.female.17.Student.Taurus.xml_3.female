I got a new book today. It’s the second book in the “Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter Series.” So far I’m liking it.  I’m also reading a book on Medieval History and a book on British History.      Tomorrow I have dance as well as school work and then I’ll probably pack Friday morning. I think we’re leaving in the afternoon for Cincinnati. I’m excited and scared at the same time. That’s a whole other issue though.     Anyway, I just thought I’d drop a line here since I’ve started updating my live journal account again. I’ll hopefully remember to update in a week or so., Au revoir!
