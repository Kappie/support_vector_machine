Dont ask me why, because I am normally a very not-mad person. Argh. Like, I can't stand it when people ask me a million bizgillion questions on the saaame topic I mind you, that I told them from the get go I dont know much about. Okay, the second thing that makes me angry is when people say that there going to do something, and they dont. When they completly blow the person off. That is really horrible. I can't stand that for the life of me. Third of all. It's really nice outside, but do you think I have anyone to go walking with, or go do something with? No. No. No. I am such a loser, that I have to spend it all inside on the computer typing in this damn blogger because no one ever wants to do anything. Ugh!  *phew* Now, onto what I hate.  I hate alot of things latley. I dont normally hate anyone/anything. I dont know whats wrong with me. Im not going to go into an extreme amount of detail, but yeah. It makes me soo aggravated because I cant say what I want to say. I always feel like Im saying something stupid. Or that something isnt right. People have that affect on me. I hate my four wheeler, because I accidently blew out one of the tires last winter, and I havent been able to ride for like 3 months now. Riding was defnintly one of my 'ska' things. That makes me so mad. I dont know what to do. But dont worry about me. Because no one ever has, and no one ever will. BaH! Im going to go before I get really mad.  Some one Save me. I will love you forever if you do!
