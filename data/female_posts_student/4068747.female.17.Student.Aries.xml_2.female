My heart beats harder and faster with every shortened breath I take. I feel like a mirror that’s been dropped and scattered into hundreds of pieces. Unable to move, I search my surroundings. It’s unknown what I’m searching for, yet I keep on.  My concentration breaks with every repulsive call of the ravens above. I search on despite the noise. A sign of meaning jumps out of nowhere like a shadow at the rise of the sun. Happiness now replaces the panic; how a dove replaced the unsuccessful ravens. As quick as lightning these feelings; along with my hope, fade into the depths below, like a mirage vanishing into the blistering heat. The crashing waves now lap against my only security. The motion sickens me so much I am forced to adjust myself.  My destination is so close yet so far. I stretech out my hand in hopes of grasping onto the hope before it leaves forever. Unsuccessful, my hand clasps onto nothing but air filled with false belief. With a splash, I fall from this unexpected abruption. The cold surrounds me, panic takes over me once again with more power than a hurricane. The ravens have found their place. Their screeches suddenly turn into calls of my name. Feeling delusional I kick my feet and move my arms to save my sanity. I grow tired and weak as I slip below the excruciatingly coldness. I manage to surface, but doubt has filled my insides weighing me down. I am overpowered and I begin to sink  Refusing to give up, I push upwards aiming for the surface. My efforts cease to prosper as hope flees my body and the surface is no longer visible. I accept this newfound reality as I close my eyes, with the last thing I see be the ravens closing in on me.
