Jose da Silva, 37, pleaded guilty to murdering 47-year-old Beatrice Harrowyn in 2001 after inviting her to his new house in a classy suburb north of Johannesburg.   "We went through the house and I told her what I wanted. She did not make any nice comments about my place so I went to my garage and fetched an axe," the Star newspaper reported him as saying.   "I killed her because she reminded me of an old school teacher whom I hated very much."  well well well. Now that I've restored your faith in humanity and interior design, let's move on.  my day was boring. The only thing I did was power walk a mile on the treadmill. I am fat, and am feeling particularly fat today because of the steak I devoured and now regret, as red meat doesn't agree with me very well.
