Well, to me, it somewhat brings out the message which I would want to tell all my friends. So, To every single friend of mine, this poem is specially dedicated to you! And to the choir members whom I dearly missed, you people have been a great bunch of friends...all the best for those participating in the Jubilate Festival!!=)
