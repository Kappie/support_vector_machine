It's been raining almost all the time for the past week but yesterday the weather got really warm and sunny. And I'm stuck at school. (To be honest, it lasts only 1 and a half hour per day, so it shouldn't be too bad but it's still school! Plus the homework.) :(  But driving lesson today went really smoothly, I'm finally getting the idea. And my friend turns 18 on Friday, we're having a party! ;) (And I'm not gonna mention that I was out "celebrating" last Saturday as well...) But summer is almost over, I have to party when I have time to do that! :P
