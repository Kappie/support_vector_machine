I am in some weird funk that I can't seem to bring myself out of.  The past few nights I haven't been sleeping well.  My thoughts are on Ed and my family...where are we headed from here?  What is going to happen?  UGH  I fall asleep watching Ed sleep, in his arms, listening to his heart beat.  The rhythm soothes my worried soul and everything is okay.  I keep telling myself everything will be okay, he has a job to do and he will be back and I will look back at all this and wonder why I made such a big fuss.  Scared...hell yeah I am scared.  Who wouldn't be in my shoes?  I keep thinking stay positive...but it has greatly affected my mood and me.  Not sleeping is making me sleep late...I am so tired and moody and tired...lol  TIRED  that is the perfect way to describe me.  AHHHH!  My father in law will be here in less than 24 hours and I have so much to do...so DO IT!!!  Someone kick me in the butt already...  Okay, I needed to vent.  I am tired of being scared and just when I thought I was over it, night time comes and I watch him sleep and all the fear comes gushing back to me.   Well I better get going...thanks.
