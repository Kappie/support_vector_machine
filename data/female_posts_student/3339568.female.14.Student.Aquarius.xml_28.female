Because no1 'cept Mel, Rach H, Rach L, Helen and I were there(because every1 was either at the epn or at roseville skool play) We decided to go to Rach H's place 4 small group instead because she couldn't get 2 Helens, so we set off for the big adventure to Duffy's Forest. Her house is way cool bi the way. The car trip was interesting. The presence of Mel always helps. We picked Rach up and Helen and Mel had a fight with the horn, which ended with Helen twisting Mel's arm, but with Mel getting many-a long honk in. :D We stopped at the service station 2 stack up on goodies, and on the way back Helen and Rach locked us out of the car and started 2 drive off, so we sat on the bonnet and the boot. hehe, that made them open up. It was quite funni.  Rach L felt compelled to stare at me in the most scary way imaginable. A face that is now gonna haunt mi dreams! Thanks Rach!! When we arrived at Rach H's, Rach L was very scared of the dogs and I had to comfort her the whole way there, and back to the car. She thought they were gonna maul her. Hehehe...  The small group discussion got a bit off the topic most of the time, but it was still God-related. Mel brought up the controversial issue of why God allowed pain and suffering in this world and she was angry at him for not giving people a choice to be created and put on earth. We had a lot of discussion on it. We shared things together, such as Helen's journey to God, the room provoked all this. It was quite a reveal-all-your-deep-and-meaningful-secrets room. It was totally cool.   Everyone got a big word to describe themselves (made by Helen - the queen of big words), such as and intermissor (or could it be interceptor?),i actually can't remember, The intermissor word was Helen and Mel, and the other big word which started with R was Rach. Man, I'm not going very well, but just trust me that they were big words! But I didn't get one. That's because Helen said that I was still on my journey and I would have one in time. Yay. And what we talked bout on Saturday night was mi word but it wasn't actually a word, if u get me. You probably don't. Oh well. The night was totally fun.  We had to stop off at the Church on the way home so Helen could get me some Bible study notes, and Rach really had to pee, as she kept on reminding us. Mel and I had a quick dash into the Church (while Rach and Helen were in the Church Centre, peeing and retreiving things) and said a quick "hello", "what're doing here?", and "bi!", to T1 and Monty.   Overall small group was really good (not that it eva isn't :P) It was good because I was really in the mood for small group. It's just like one of those days where you feel like sitting down with friends, in the warmth of a fire and talking about God, y'know? Small group tonight kinda helped me to re-affirm how lucky I am. I mean, I haven't had an abused or hard childhood, I have a great family, lots of luxuries if I think about it, I have GREAT friends (i luv ya guys!) and I have God, the best of all! So now I can put things into perspective. I mean, sure, I'm not gonna get everything I want. But at least now I can be happy with what I have. Thanks God.
