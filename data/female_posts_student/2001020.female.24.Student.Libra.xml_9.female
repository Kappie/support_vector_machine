He likes her a lot and his feelings for me are gone...I don't get it at all. I can't comprehend it. But it's over. It has ended. This cycle has come to an end for me. There's nothing left to feel and if there is, well, it's not legitimate. It's unfounded. He wants her and she surely wants him again. And they've both changed and they'll be happy together. I awake from sleeping hoping this is all a bad dream, but it's not. It's my reality. My disease will eventually be cured, my disease of being in love with someone who doesn't love me anymore. I'll never see him again. We will never be in the same place at the same time ever again. He'll be out of my life forever, forever, forever. This is it. He's going to go on his merry way being with someone who cannot love him near as much as I do ("para ser mas franca nadie piensa en ti como lo hago yo..." -Shakira, "Inevitable"), but it doesn't matter. It's over, he's gone, it's done. "Seguir amandote es inevitable." -Shakira, "Inevitable" Cry, sleep, cry, sleep.
