I remember the first day that I started working: five minutes into the job I was already bored out of my mind.  It's the same crap over and over again. (1)You say "hello" to the costumers,(2) you ask them how many people they have and what their "smoking preference is", AND FINALLY,(3)you seat them. I complain now, but I don't think I'll be complaining once I pick up my first check.  I get $7.50 an hour just for completing those 3 simple steps for hours upon hours. Not Bad, Eh? But while I was talking to Landry yesterday, I realized why I get paid so much for such a simple job.  Dirty, old, and many times drunk men walk in and act like the hostesses are there for their perverted enjoyment.  While these crusty preverts are dreaming of taking us home, we have to stand there and take it.  If we go off on any of these men while they are grabbing our asses or pulling us closer into their stench infested bodies, we could get fired. Now, that's the part that sucks.  Okay, maybe that's a little exaggerated,and thank God it's lasts for only seconds (although it feels like a lifetime).  But after summer, I will probably quit and I'll be able to work for my dad, where any old men that hit on me there will be fired! It's nice how those roles can be switched...
