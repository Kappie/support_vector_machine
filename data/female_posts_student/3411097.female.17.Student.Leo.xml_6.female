HaiZz.. lately really busy with tests! KaoZ.. teachers were all giving tests and consultations!!! Really not much time to hang out with frenZ... really wanna tell ping that i miss her a lotZzz!!! Though those days we had esp this yr was jus simple yet every single day meant alot to me.. You were by my side when i faced problems.. You were there to acco me to study for my exams.. You sat quietly by side to encourage me to go on studying and not give up.. You were there when i quarrel with ceyi.. I guess i wont be what i am today(though not really well-off)if not for u.. Haha.. *Dun be too haolian k?* You will alwayZ be my best buddy.. And really hope to come to me when u need someone there k? Dun keep things to urself! Haha~  HaiZz tml gg to be a long day..
