Cause, one was for the race and the other was a team metal cause we got second place (out of 5 teams but THATS NOT IMPORTANT!!!) My time sucked though. I did 19:24... VERY off my PR but oh well. Yea, I think I'm gonna hang around the house tonight. I don't feel much like going out, just relax maybe force my mom to take me to Blockbuster so I can rent "Down With Love" or something. Plus, I'm kinda worried cause Mick goin to Notre Dame on Saturday all depends on his party tonight. If it gets outta hand hes not allowed to go so... he's gonna call me lata when he gets the word. But if he does go hes gonna be in the same Hotel as me!! How cool? I think very!! Okay, I'm gonna go watch some TV, maybe rent a movie. Much love x0x0x0x
