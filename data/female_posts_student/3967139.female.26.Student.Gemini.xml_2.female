I really enjoy seeing Andy.  We can go for long periods of time hardly communicating and then when we get together it's as if we just saw each other yesterday.  Unfortunately I was not able to see Jarusha and Kurt.  I hope she understands that I rarely see Andy and I will see her again in October.  I just wish that I had called sooner to clarify what was happening.  My car, which seemed so roomy just a few days ago suddenly seems so very cramped.  I'm not sure I will be able to take everything that I would like.  I already have one box packed for Mom to send after I get to school.  I hope to keep up with this as much as possible during the big trip but only time will tell.
