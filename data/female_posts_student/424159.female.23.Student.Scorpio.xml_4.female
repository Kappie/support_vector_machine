Traffic was a bitch trying to get out of there, but other than that, it was great!  I'm having a blast at Puff's, and I got to see Kristin (the little freak!) and her brother Brad (mini ghetto thug), Meghan (exactly how many times are you gonna trade in your car and/or get a new cell phone?), Lena, Ben (great guy!  I'm very happy for Puff), and last but not least Robyn and Andrew (two extremely cool people I wish I got to know earlier).  It is unfortunate, but I didn't get to see Ana, Amanda, Meredith, or Carpenter.  Hopefully next time I'll see 'em all.  A funny thing happened on the way to the forum:  Kristin and I drove past Cypress Creek.  It was a very emotional moment for me, and I almost cried as we cruised through the parking lot.  I had some of the best times of my life at that school and with most of the people mentioned above (Puff, Kristin, and Ana I probably wouldn't have made it through High School without you.  Meghan and Amanda, thanks for keeping me "occupied" on the weekends!).  It's sad that it took a trip back home to Florida to make me realize how thankful I am for each and every one of my friends in Florida.  I owe you guys so much.  We've had good times, bad times, and ugly times.  In the end I want you all to know that I love all of you.  Thanks again for getting me through it all.   I miss you guys.
