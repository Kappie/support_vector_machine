I still have yet to hear from North Carolina and Georgia, but I'll probably go to UC unless another school offers me more moolah. (That is a technical term). In a way, I had prepared myself to not get in anywhere, so I'm having to readjust my thinking a little. I love the people here so much - my family, friends, etc. And Ohio will be cold. But it will be exciting for me - I'm a single woman, going off to another big city to get her Ph.D and continue experiencing life. And the Ohio River is right there, so at least I'll have a little water. I think, unless things change and I go to another school, Mums and I are going to fly to Cin City next month to check out the school and get everything in order. I'm a little scared, but I have a friend - Jonathan Paden - who lives in Dayton, Ohio (45 minutes away). So I'll get to hang out with him and I'm sure I'll make friends . . . right?   Here's to years of 3 a.m. libraries, months of 10 cent Ramen Noodle meals, the drama that is the dissertation, and intimidating professors, crazy roommates, housepets named Wayne, and no free time.   Ohio, prepare for the LaChelle.   Love the LaChelle.  The LaChelle will love you back.   But you know what I'm most excited about? New thrift stores.
