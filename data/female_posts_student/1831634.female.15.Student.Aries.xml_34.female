And if he does... tough.  =D  And then I hafta go try to track him down tomorrow so I can tell him what we're doing and so we can go to Ms. Kite and see if my idea is even acceptible.  Because it's a bit.... big.  (I'm gonna get those 5 wow points, darnit!)  but then I feel bad cuz so many ppl from my class asked to work with me....  am I subconsciously preferring jack?  (or even... consciously?!)  gah.  scariness.  I be cold.  I be only wearing one of my lacey tank top things.  **brr  I still have french and biology to do.  ho hum.  tomorrow is thursday!!  dun hafta do tomorrow hw!!  =D  anyone wanna come to a Chamber Music International concert with me on friday?
