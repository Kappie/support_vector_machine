Yeah well... the ball was pitched way inside, yet I still swung at it. How dumb am I? Ok so yeah I swung at that stupid inside ball and you'll never guess what happened? DUH...I HIT IT OVER THE FENCE!!!!...yeah right...like that'll ever happen.  But yeah instead it hit my finger.  Do you know how bad that hurts? Worst of all it made underneath my wart bleed like a blood blister.  I couldn't feel my finger so I bit it so the blood would come out right? Yeah that was another bad idea. Hurt like a freakin mofo. And above all of that some jackass sitting on the other teams side decides to yell "Oh come on we don't have all day" Man if I wouldn't have been hurt I think I would have gone over and knocked that guy a good one...I hate inconciderate bastards. But WORST OF ALL...I think my fingers infected now cuz it has a red circle around it... my mom seems to think I should go to the doctor but like any other scared lil kid I said NO! Docs are scary!
