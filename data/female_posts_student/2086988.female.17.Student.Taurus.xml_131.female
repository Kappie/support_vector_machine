I didn't even make a high enough score to be considered for my scholarship. And now I'm going to have to take it again on September 25th, like it's going to make a difference. I'm still stupid and suck at the thing. I'm sure Kiera could make a better score. I was counting on a high score, so I could get at least 66-100% of that scholarship and now I didn't even qualify it. How am I going to go to college now? They should seriously get rid of standardized testing, it's complete bullshit.
