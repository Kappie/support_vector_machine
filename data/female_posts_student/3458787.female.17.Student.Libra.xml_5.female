That means you get whatever you ask for from your parents, right?" And I think to myself, "Oh man, what a big misconception these people are in!".  When something goes wrong in the house for some reason all the fingers always point at me. Let's say the TV in my house stopped working. The first thing that I will be asked is, " Hey VALLI! What in the world did you do to the TV!" when I would not even have touched it for hours. Then there are other stuff too.   Although I'm 18 now (ok ok 17+ exactly), a mature young adult in the eyes of the law, my parents still doubt my ability to look after myself when I'm home alone- they will call to check on me like a gazillion times.  Then there is the issue of money. I'm still being given daily allowance (haha but I should say I probably get loads and loads more than some of my friends I I sum my all that I get). My parents feel that I'm not old enough to handle large sums of money without spending it ( REMINDER! I'm going on 18 this September!). I'm still seen as a "baby" in their eyes.    Ok, I have to be fair so I will admit that I think that there is quite a bit of an advantage being an only child or so I believe from what I hear. Firstly, in my life there is no such thing as sibling rivalry (duh!) or "passed down" toys or clothes. Everything I own is entirely mine and mine only haha. This is good to an extent I guess but I have to say that I miss out on all the "fun" of being able to borrow my "big sister's" clothes and feel like a grown-up wearing them.   Grass is always greener on the other side for some reason. I've always wanted a sibling- be it younger or older(through I prefer the latter a little more than the other). I always wondered how it would be to have a person to talk to whenever and whatever you want to. A person who will know you inside out. A person to share you deep inner feelings about issues and who you are very certain that you can tell ALL your secrets to. A person like a brother or sister! :)
