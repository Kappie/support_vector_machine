Checked out a practice book from the library, seven more tests. It just angers me how I can't do this, and it's probably exacerbated by the fact that I thought ok, lit should be easy, it's just CRITICAL READING.  So after a less-than-stellar (score), I really wish I could go online and talk to someone. I've been tempted to click on that stupid yellow button. I'm frustrated at myself, at my apparent stupidity, at the fact that I haven't yet mastered the nuances of the written word in a language I've been speaking practically all of my life. I missed fifteen out of sixty questions. That's a 75%, or a C, in the academic world. Lydia cannot afford to get C's.  Farewell to invincibility, I say, not that I had it in the first place. I know I can't go online. I can just see what'll happen: little superficial conversations about how everyone's tired, how school sucks, how SATIIs and APs are fast approaching. I don't care to discuss that with people right now, I have too much on my plate for idle talk. I know just about everybody who's going to show up online, since they're just about always online. I don't have anything to say to them except to convey an annoyance they probably can't understand, and I have no use for empty sympathy, either.  I don't remember this kind of despair before the SATIs. Maybe because then math was the lagging subject and there was actually something concrete I could study, something I could review. That Kaplan book is the only reason I did well.  10:03 pm. I wonder what I'm going to do for the rest of the night. I can't go online, I won't let myself stoop down to that level. I have the bio book stored away in the media room cabinet, I should go retrieve it. I'll put in eye drops or something since my eyes are itchy. I see my bad test paper. I took a green marker to it: green, the color of hope. Twenty points more, what hope is that? I can study history, I need that by May 1. Ballard is as boring as hell, very sorry to offend any of you. Dad's feeding information into my right ear about visiting colleges this summer, and even though I want to go I really don't need to hear it right now. It's really not a joke anymore. I think tomorrow I'm going to whip out my study book and start reading during Ballard's tangents. Oh wait. I don't have him tomorrow. Even better.  I'm sorry, but I just feel like a weak, helpless loser right now.  At least I'm listening to the Postal Service. [RUBS ITCHY EYES]
