       
      I feel like I've lost something. Like a peice of me is gone. I don't know what it is, it just isn't there...   I haven't been able to cry. Not since the night I called mark. Since the night dad told me we're leaving. I just haven't been able to cry, no matter what happened. I didn't cry, not even when Ben told me he found a girlfriend. Not when I told my friends what was going on. Not when I realized what might happen to me...   I feel hardened. Like nothing can get in anymore. Apathetic. Like even if something really good happened to me right now, I'm not sure I would smile. If I cut myself right now, if I could cry. Tears well up in my eyes, but something suppresses them. I feel like...   Like I've lost my soul.
