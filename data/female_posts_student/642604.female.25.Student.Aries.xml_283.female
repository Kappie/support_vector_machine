Someone said at the end of our session today that it was like one might feel after a good session of yoga.  All I can say is for the first time since I got to Boston I remembered why it is that singing is something I have to do, I need to do because it feeds my soul, my heart.  Sounds corny doesn't it?  It wouldn't if you had been there tonight.  Seven of us crowded in a room, singing our hearts out, blending together, it was amazing.  And to think I didn't even want to go to the makeup class to begin with, I almost blew it off.  It was one of the most self satisfying experiences I had ever had.  We all had an energy, we all were in synch and I just can't even begin to put the experience into words.  I wish our normal class time was like this.
