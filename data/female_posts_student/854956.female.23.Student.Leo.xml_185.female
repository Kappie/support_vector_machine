Then my Mom and I went to the grocery store to buy some things... needed something for dinner tonight and all.  So, tonight my Mom and I are going to make some homemade chili... MMM.  Tomorrow the plan is for me to go buy Target (I need a couple things) and I also need to go try and find some new bras.  Heh heh... I know ALL the guys who read my blog wanted to know about my bra purchasing... ; )  The rest of the week is still undetermined.  I was thinking of giving Naomi a call and going to dinner with her Wednesday or Thursday or something... I dunno.  We'll just have to see on that one.  So... a couple days ago this body was found in SA... someone was driving by and noticed something on the side of the road on fire.  They took a look and noticed it was a dead body someone had dumped off and set on fire.  So, by hearing the street names of a near intersection (both were farm roads) it sounded like it was right near the "spot" Joe and I used to go to.  I'm not sure, but I think it's very possible.  When they showed the little map thing, it really looked like it was the place.... that's so weird.  I mean, this body had two holes through the head...  Whew... anyhow... Oh... I actually did pretty well on my midterm in lab...!!!  I got a B, and I really thought there was a chance I'd end up with a D or F.  So, I came out on top with that one!  :-)  I'm just really happy that I'm getting a week of rest... and on that note, I shall go and help my Mom get dinner started here in a bit... :-P
