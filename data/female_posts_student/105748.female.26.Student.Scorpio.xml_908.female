After learning that the town is divided between two gangsters, he plays one side off against the other. His efforts are complicated by the arrival of the evil one-eyed son of one of the gangsters (John Goodman).  Clooney tries to pretend he's his long lost brother, but is found out, and has to run for his life.  Clooney stumbles across his real family, and tries to win them back.  Film is particularly notable for its Japanese bluegrass soundtrack.  I was gonna make a cheezy joke about Space Rump Rangers, but I was afraid I'd encourage Brian...
