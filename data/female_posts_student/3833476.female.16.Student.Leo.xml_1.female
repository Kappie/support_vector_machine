Because people only read them if they are interesting. In that case, no one is probably reading mine. I mean, how is  my  life  interesting ? The only things I do are go to driving school, watch TV, laze around the house and occasionally go see movies or shop. But so does, like, half of the US.  Some people have such cool and interesting lives. Like I was reading a blog of a girl who is trying to make it in the music business. And I read the author  urlLink Sarah Dessen's livejournal .(my fav author- you should read her books) But of course hers is good because she writes for a living! Well, I think I'll go laze around some more.  Listening to- "Memory" by Sugarcult
