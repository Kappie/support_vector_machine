The most difficult part of this thing was what to name my blog.  What is it about me that is most important.  I really don't think that being a medical student defines me but really is what takes most of my time right now, by default it becomes the name.  I have a gastro intestinal(GI) exam on Friday.  My very last exam in second year.  I am very afraid being weeks and weeks behind and having no hope to catch up.  So in order to celebrate being so far behind I decided to go see Troy.  I had very, very low expectations about the movie so I was not hard to meet them.  But overall I though the movie was not bad.  They could have done a much better job with the cinematography but I was too enthralled by the sight of the men wearing the sarongs...  Some men should only be allowed to wear sarongs, Brad Pitt is one of the lucky ones.  There was a bit too much killing for my liking and the scenes with the burning dead reminded me of the anatomy lab.  When Hector is in the pyre and his father is placing the coins on his eyes I though Hector is just going to snap out of it and bite his father (very odd though in hindsight).  I feel the same way in the anatomy lab, the body is just going to wake up and shake my hand.  I came home and called my boyfriend, he had also gone to see Troy with his best friend.  How funny.  At some point in the movie his friend turned towards him and said that he was no longer sure that he was a heterosexual.  I am the queen of procrastination having spend so many years wasting time.  My favourite way to do it is reading the news.  I tell myself is good for you.  You don't want to be one of the med students that knows nothing of the world.  If you were not to have found out that the roof of the Paris airport collapsed would you still be a complete person?  The worse is that I am starting to have a reputation for my procrastination, my friends are calling their procrastination pulling a Silvana. I don't know if that is a compliment or not.
