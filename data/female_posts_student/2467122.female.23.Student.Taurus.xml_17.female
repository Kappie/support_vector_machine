I thought for sure that I had bombed that one. God works in mysterious ways...  In other news, I am finding it harder and harder to type with these damn nails!  Next time they are getting cut way short- I am going to have a freaking fit if I make another type because of these stupid things!  Oh, well- it's my own fault I suppose.  I will learn to get over it.  Sitting here, wasting some time online checking out cool new Internet Explorer skins.  I am totally addicted to personalizing my computer... It's my baby!If anyone else gets this bored, feel free to email me- BabyFatChance@hotmail.com   Okay.  Just wanted to check in before I hit the sack.   Time for bed- minus the cute little bedtime buddy I left behind in NYC... :*(  Miss you Eeyore!!!
