I'm getting an extreemly nasty cold that both of my parents have had and so they said "hey, i've got an idea, lets get Jenni sick so she can be miserable". The sad thing is, i'm sure that they are going to make me go to school tomorrow, it's like they try and make me feel like crap. Parents suck   Rhedyn "Nevermore"
