I dont really want to leave today now, because I know that I'm going to be left out and there's going to be nothing to do. I'm so much different than everyone. I'm not the same as I used to be. *sigh*..Nobody there is like me..not anyone, and..I feel horrible now. I want to be with bill. I do..I want to be at his house cuddling and sleeping with him. AHH! I made another stupid decision. i dont want to make decisions anymore..I hate when I do it. I always make the wrong ones. I hate myself..:(  I miss *you*..:(
