Still couldn’t organise myself very well though, was supposed to be in Stratford for 10:00am, I made it there for 10:45am.  Couldn’t help but initially feel that Ann wasn’t best impressed with my presence, not that I really cared. Mum remarked, probably for the sake of having something to say, that she’d never been to some out-of-town store or other, so needless to say, off we went. It was tacky and cheap, I’m sure Mum won’t be returning. Then much to my horror there was a B next door so we wondered into that too. Why people go to these nasty stores on Sundays is beyond me, have they got nothing better to do with their time?  Lunch was supposed to be at 2:00pm, so I thought, but no being a barbeque it was eventually cooked by 3:15pm (I was hoping for an early-ish return home too!). Had a chat with my cousin Bridget, discussed Mum with Ann after she’d left at 4:00pm. Ann clearly thinks I’m doing too much for Mum, and looking at today I have to say that I won’t be going down to Stratford again simply because Mum wants me too. It seems like a case of cruel to be kind, but I can’t live her life for her. Nor can I drop everything to keep her company to allay her fears.  If only things were simple.  Got back home at about 5:30pm. Haven’t achieved anything much this evening. Had Mum on the phone twice already, neither about anything important.   Another source of irritation is that I still haven’t ventured out to do any form of exercise.  All in all, not a productive weekend.
