Firstly school was so boring and on my way to school, I fell asleep which I am not supposed to, IF NOT, my father will KILL ME! 0_o Luckily, he was also sleepy and blamed it on the BBC news and quickly switched to Newsradio 93.8 FM. I can tell you, I have been listening to BBC since the day my father fetched me to school. Their English is actually not very accurate especially their overseas correspondent, and their babbling can put me to sleep easily.... Only recently my father switched to a more interesting 93.8 FM for the recent SARS case and situation and they will only report at 7am and I am already in my car by 6.50am and have to suffer for 10 minutes of sheer torture trying to open my eyes before getting a scolding and 'beating' from my father. Haiz... what to do? As long I can 'tahan' for a few months, everything will be fine.... -___-
