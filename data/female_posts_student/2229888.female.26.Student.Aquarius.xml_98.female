Anyway, we were identical except one was a preganant super model (rebecca jane stamos) and the other was a single mom of one and one on the way, who was a size 14 before pregnancy.  For some reason the twins went on a pregnant get-away cruise. While there, they changed bodies.  They went back home a month later, in their exchanged bodies, but still living their own lives.   The super model was afraid her husband (JON STAMOS) was going to hate how she looked, but he told her she was more beautiful than ever.  The single mom's best friends suddenly hated her (except one), and she was ogled constantly and sexual remarks were hurled at her wherever she went. Also, she learned from her sister that she had to take low impact kickboxing and eat two leaves of lettuce each meal to keep that super model body.  There was a part when the super model mom went to some kind of fashion show and everyone looked at her like she was ugly and fat. She watched some kind of show where little people and tall, skinny people were half-naked and painted in swirling colors. When the super model tried to cross the stage later, she fell and couldn't get up because of a cramp in her abdomen. No one would help her,  except on of the little people who said that he was a graduate of harvard drama (i don't know if that really exists), and these were the only gigs he could get.  The model, who started off as a push-over was , by the end, a stronger person who stood up for herself. She actually slapped her agent in the face at one point because of a remark she made.  The single mom, who had started off slowly working her way toward anorexia, learned that having that super model body wasn't worth the trouble it caused. She also found out how beautiful she could be and that she wasn't as fat as she thought, when she saw her sister dressed great and looking great in the size 14 body.  At the end, they got their old bodies back, but the super model gave up modeling and became a plus-size designer. (she'd had to design her own clothes in her former body and decided she had a knack for it)  And the single mom started dressing better and having confidence in herself without having to starve for it.  What a weird dream.
