I hung out with Lissa during the day, thanks for the date Raggeddy Anne. We saw Dodgeball and it was funny. Afterwards, we went to Coldstone and ate lots of ice cream. She took me home and I took a long nap. Woke up to a call and let's just say I blasted my new fave Oct. Fall song up after that. I got my fucked up report card and now my mom thinks I'm a failure who's not gonna be able to get into college but w.e Idk right now so I packed some more then I rushed to Carson's to get stuff but it was close so that was a waste. After that I called Kev up and I drove to his house, picked him up and we went to Lake Opeka just to talk for a while. We just kept laughing and making fun of each other then making up again so it was funny convos but with serious stuff liek talking about our regrets and the things we miss. Man, I wish Kev's heart never got broken. He's too good of a guy. Well I'm going to go lay down and think about what I miss now but here's some songs..  "Tell me what I have to do tonight Cuz I'd do anything to make it right To be us again.  Here I stand with everything to lose All I know is I don't Want to see the end. I'm reaching out for you Won't you open up your heart And let me come back in.  Look at me I'm way past pride Isn't there some way That we can try To be us again Even if it takes a while I'll wait right here Until I see that smile That says we're us again."-Lonestar : Let's Be Us Again  "Too bad, Let's make it of what we have. Life gets so hard without the best. Can't send this down, I'm sick of this life when it comes out of me...  How does it feel, you wanna know? I'm so distraught, I can't be left alone Never, seems forever. Days still take down in December.  See into this break, And the memories here tell me, Do they care, to care? When will I lose this burden I wear? And do they care, to care?  Get you back into my life, Gotta get you. Get you back into my life. There's no way that I can do this right. Gotta get you, Get you back into my life, Yeah...  How could this be a day to me? Like a shame to me. Regretful thoughts they break me, Make me see, without you I can't be me.  See into your brown eyes, Turn into your brown eyes. See why your world is down, And I don't make a sound. I just wanna see you, Just wanna be you, Cause I don't wanna let you down...  See into this break,  And the memories here tell me, Do they care, to care? When will I lose this bruden I wear? And tell me, Do they care, to care?  Get you back into my life, Gotta get you. Get you back into my life. There's no way that I can do this right. Gotta get you, Get you back into my life."-Rocket Summer : December Days        urlLink Take the test , by  urlLink Emily .
