The summer I session ends on July 7th and I know that by the time it gets here it will be a welcome reprieve.  I, foolishly, decided to take two Internet classes for Summer I.  Freshman Comp –which I happened to get a D in when I was 18- and American Government.  Both classes require a great deal of concentration and work, I only hope that I start doing better than I have been so far.  So far I’ve gotten a 70, a 72, and a 12 out of 20 –those are my grades, and the semester just started!  Maybe I wasn’t cut out for Internet classes.  I really have very little choice though, I signed up for them and have to finish them.  They are going to be my last two classes at MCC so I am going to try to get good grades.  Otherwise, things are looking up!  Matt’s financial aid for Tarleton finally came in.  I have been worried about it, though realistically there was nothing I could do but wait.  So I did just that, waited, and his award came through today!  Thank goodness for small miracles, I really needed this.  My stress level was beginning to rise again!    Now, about the only thing to worry about comes in the form of housing.  We have no idea where we’re going to live when we move to Stephenville.  The problem is that while the town is small it boasts a state university.  Under the circumstances, there is little housing available, so what there is available is more expensive than it is here in Waco.    Our financial aid went up a little bit, but so did tuition.  Hopefully everything will work out, hopefully!  It has so far, so I have no reason to believe that it won’t continue to…hmm, that must be my rational mind speaking.  Y’all who know me know that I tend to be a bit, oh, how should I put this, pessimistic.  I cannot help it it’s how I’ve always been.  That way I can be surprised when things actually work out.  Still, I do tend to be down when things don’t –even when I expected it!  Paint me never satisfied!  ~Kristyn
