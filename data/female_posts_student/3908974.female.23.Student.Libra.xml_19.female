Two weeks is a long time if you've only been dating for twelve or so.  Feels like he's been sent to Siberia.    So I've had a hell of a weekend, but I couldn't really say much about it.  I drank copiously and immersed myself in politics.  Fahrenheit 9/11, Distorted Morality (Noam Chomsky), lots and lots of news.  I am feeling the glut of it all, the resulting guilt for being complacent.  And of course the knowledge that my complacence probably has no more effect than any of the proactive things I have done in my life to stop the tide.  Conversations with friends have become forums and debates.  My father and I, both deeply immersed in early American governmental ideology and documents, took breakfast over Hemingway and war.  What can I do?  All I do is become more and more aware, more thoroughly educated.  And though it shakes the foundations of my little universe, the sun rises and sets as usual.  It's raining today.  I have been asked to go to Santa Cruz and I am tempted.  In spite of my outrage I am going to go home and read Jane Eyre again and eat some cheese.
