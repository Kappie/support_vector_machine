I went to bed rather early, too, hoping that sleep would help me feel better, but it didn't exactly work much although I slept for about 11-12 hours.  I did a research on mucus and colds a little while ago and learned a lot.  I'm not sure how much I'll get done today since I don't feel very well at all, and that's bad since horror weeks 1 and 4/5 are coming up, and it doesn't even end there, for about a week later is All-State, and a week later is SAT, then I still need to set up some college visits for Spring Break... and then, of course, there're the two weeks I've been dreading the entire school year: the AP exams. I haven't started preparing for any of this (save for All-State, but only slightly), and I really don't need to be sick now. *Sigh* Believe it or not, though, some good has resulted out of my illness: I have to write a 1.5 page calculus problem (or some length to that extent, I think) for extra credit for Mrs. Dunn, and I've decided that mine will likely, in some amusing form, involve my cold and the exponential rate of growth of my dead white blood cells that cause my mucus to be coloured. Hehe.   Okay, enough for now, I suppose.   I guess I'll try to clean up a little bit and then try to get some schoolwork done.    "Return to Innocence" by Enigma    That's not the beginning of the end That's the return to yourself The return to innocence Love - Devotion Feeling - Emotion  Love - Devotion Feeling - Emotion  Don't be afraid to be weak Don't be too proud to be strong Just look into your heart my friend That will be the return to yourself The return to innocence  If you want, then start to laugh If you must, then start to cry Be yourself don't hide Just believe in destiny  Don't care what people say Just follow your own way Don't give up and use the chance To return to innocence  That's not the beginning of the end That's the return to yourself The return to innocence  Don't care what people say Follow just your own way Follow just your own way Don't give up, don't give up To return, to return to innocence. If you want then laugh If you must then cry Be yourself don't hide Just believe in destiny.
