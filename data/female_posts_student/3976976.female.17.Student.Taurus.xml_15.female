I know i'm doing better now, I finally try to go out with other guys and well... now HE is in the back of my mind. When i see him, he is just another face in the crowd. He is not what I want, He doesnt like the outdoors, I love it and need a guy that will love that with me. He doesnt like to get dirty, I'd love to mudd wrestle with a guy someday, hopefully not just hopes of him falling will happen, but he will be falling emotionally too, for me! HE doesnt like animals, Animals are my life, eventually and hopefully my career. He hates the government, i want to marry into the military and one day work as a civilian on an Air Force Base. By pointing out all of what we dont have in common, well, each time i let go, peice by peice, because i know, hes not what im looking for. He doesnt speek his mind, he doesnt let me know. I want someone, who is comfortable in their skin, and they know to an extent want they want. I want someone who will never give up, and always push harder no matter what. I want an athlete to keep up with me, because everyone knows the hassle that I can be. Mr. Perfect or semi at that, maybe not perfect at all, but was meant for me, where are you! when will we finally be? are you here, or farther along the road? i'm willing to wait, because i know when i find you, i'll finally be happy.. for now, im just out for casual dating, because when we finally meet, you will stand out from the rest and it will be an unexplainable experience.. i just cant wait. till im finally there with you. No longer will pain and love go hand in hand.. you will erase that from my system, and show me what love is.  I am such a romantic but yet, you see the tough me! the one who can probably kick your ass, no I know I can kick your ass... Im Mayra and no one messes with me.... I've always held my own and I know who I am and what I can be. No guy will ever take that away, good or bad. I know ME!
