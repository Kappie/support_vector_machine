Well so I am thinking, hmmm...will I go?  I think I will.  That is if our class has one because we all know how flakey our class was.  Hello...can we say messed up grad nite trip to Disneyland?  I can't believe I missed out on it because it was last minute.  UGH!  I was so looking forward to that too.  Oh gosh and senior ball?  Hello, dinky little nite clubs were not meant to hold senior balls.  I don't care how cheap it was.  Ed's brother had his prom at a hotel.  What is the world coming to?  Mind you, he goes to a Catholic High School...and my public school was against having it at a hotel because of the "SEX" issue.  Hello, people were going to have sex whether you have it at a hotel or not.  LOL  You don't agree?  Anyway, I want to lose some weight before going....only because high school was a hard thing for me...especially in the end when rumors of everything were floating around and people are already critical of me...well maybe well deserved because in the past few years I have been highly critical of others...but hey, I am changing...anyway, so I don't want to give people anymore ammunition to rag on me.  Ah, who the hell cares anyway, I have a great marriage (although wasn't always easy to get to its greatness, just ask Keiko)...and well I have three beautiful kids.  My likfe is pretty great...just working away at that degree.  Okay, so those were my random thoughts for the hour.  I have been blogging a lot...I must miss writing.  Oh, I can't wait until next semester, really...I can't wait.
