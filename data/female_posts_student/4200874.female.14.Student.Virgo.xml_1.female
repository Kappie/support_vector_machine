Geez... how utterly embarrassing. His abs... sorry y'all, it does ABSOLUTELY nothing to me... a little TOO toned to me. 5 VMA nominations... okay I'll admit that's impressive BUT Beyonce, Outkast  Justin Timberlake got 5 nominations last year as well. Plus, what makes people think that he'll win 'em all anyway! Sheesh... too much praise  flattery. I sure as hell hope he doesn't win 'em all (I know... IMPOSSIBLE! A girl CAN dream!)       Anyhow, SHOCKER! Apparently, Justin Timberlake proposed to Cameron Diaz - from the Sun  some other Daily sumthin, seriously can't remember what it's called. Not reliable sources, tabliods I think. HOPEFULLY, it's a farce. Nothing against Diaz, but I'd rather Timberlake marry someone younger, and NOT as 23. He's too young for God's sakes! Maybe when he's older  not to Diaz although they seem really happy together. Perhaps there's someone out there who compliments him perfectly... better than Diaz does, DEFINITELY better than Spears.       Feel pretty proud of myself! Completed ALL my homework for the weekend, at least those that I've recieved. I can concentrate on preparing for the 4 tests next week then during the weekend! Even managed Amath! WOOHOO! Ahem... Let's see : Biology, Geog Elective, Lit - KOTC  English... oh boy, sure hope I'll be able to make it. DEFINITELY need to improve!       THE APPRENTICE : must watch y'all! ;)       -Peace Out!-     Mothers weep, children sleep      So much violence ends in silence      It's a shame there's no one to blame      For all the pain that life brings      If u will just take me It might just complete me      And together we can make a stand
