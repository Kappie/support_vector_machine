Its not that bad we were sweeping sawdust, sitting on our asses, then pretending to sweep sawdust, and now we're cleaning up some of the science classrooms, so its not too awful, although theres no one here to talk to, so i'm just sitting here listening to my music in my own little world.   I want to apologize to some people, you know who you are, i've been avoiding you without telling you and its just that i've been so busy and i have a lot on my mind that i need to just think about by myself without everybody tossing in their 2 cents about what i should do. i'm analyzing the situations and i'm gonna take care of them and i'll be back to my regular old self so just give me some time but meanwhile i'm sorry for being an extremely crappy friend, forgive me???  Well that's all I have to say for now, but since I am extremely bored don't be surprised if you see like 20 more posts (that I doubt anyone would read anyways...) buh bye!
