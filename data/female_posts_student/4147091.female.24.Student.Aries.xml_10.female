Last night, after I had consigned myself to yet another night of tv watching while feeling bad for my sick self, I receive a call from friends - independently.  And all of a sudden my germ infested house is party central.  Well, not really, but there was more than one body in my house for several hours last night.    We laughed, we cried till the wee hours when I kicked them all out for making fun of my complete disregard for my exboyfriends feelings.  Was that wrong?  I don't think so....hell, it was 3am.  Am i feeling any better today?  Nope.  I feel just as crappy as yesterday, although I"m going to the doctor today.  Not for this flu that I"ve seem to catch, but for some unrelated girly thing that 'has to be done' as some people put it.  But while I"m there, I"m most definatly going to bring up that I"m sick.  Who knows, maybe there is a cure for the common cold?  Last night brought about some truly interested questions that have spawned a little self analysis.  I am, unchallenaged, the most superficial person most of my friends know.  I realized that years ago and I"ve embraced it.  But last night I began to think long and hard at the men in my life, or men who have been in my life.  For all my superficial qualities, I certainly don't pick the models.  Not that I"m the modelling attracting type.  But I"m beginning to think my label as superfical is somewhat un-called for.  I would have to re-label me as random, as all the men I"ve dated have NOTHING in common, physically or personality wise.  So, I"m going to interrupt my well-meaning friends from now on and replace their label of superfical with random.  (I think it will last roughly 10 minutes before I"m off chasing the cute bass player in the Trews again).
