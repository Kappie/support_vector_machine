I'm going to college right now and I'm taking Computer animation and I just finished my first year FYI and I wanted to talk about smartasses for a minute; a few quarters ago in my school I was taking math and yes there were quite a few A holes in there but I really couldn't help it I got math anxiety and plus I kept asking a lot of questions which really annoyed everyone because the teacher was such a bore ( and that was my way of getting back) I really didn't mean any harm I was just trying to get by. BUT the teacher was a real smart mouth and he would love to call me out and make me look stupid in front of the whole class, but that's how he got his jollies off so one day I got up and told him to his face that I was real tired of his smartass big mouth attitude and I left and reported his ass to the president of the school and then I got one on one help with my math and I got a "B" and I finally passed! And I'm learning that 4th quarter is kinda rough but I'm hanging in there, we use a lot of Adobe computer software like Photoshop, AfterEffects and Adobe Illustrator. We're also learning how to use this really complicated Japanese Software called "Retas" (Pronounced Ray-toss) and inside the software they have Retas Traceman where you can either scan a drawing or make one in Photoshop or Illustrator and this awesome program will trace it for you but you have to make sure you "clean" your drawings first, meaning make sure all the erase marks or unwanted lines, then once it's traced you have to make sure all the lines are closed so when you use Retas Paintman to color it in, the color doesn't spill all over the place. And then there's Retas core, where you import all the colored drawings into to make an "Animatic" ie Animation. We also do quite a bit of hand drawn cells where there's atleast 120 frames (pages) where you have to keep drawing to make your character(s) move and we capture them with a camera and use a program called "Quick Checker" then it plays back using QuickTime. And all you Artists out there that are really good at what you do PLEASE follow your dreams and persue that career you always wanted, It's worth it. I have always been good at drawing and the smartest move I ever made was going to college to be an Animator, I love college soo much and no matter what I'll never drop out because if I did I would just be throwing my life long dream away and that's never going to happen.
