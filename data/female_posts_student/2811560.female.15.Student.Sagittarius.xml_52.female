Wind ensemble was really sad today. Everyone was signing autograph books and there was just this feeling like something huge is coming to an end. And Andy was handing out these CDs of a song he wrote called "Four Year Blue". I listened to it after school and its REALLY good. He had a sheet of lyrics at the end and he put a message at the end of it: "Thank you for everything. Let this song be a reflection of every chapter of your life. May it touch your heart the way you have touched mine. May your lives be filled with happiness, and hope that someday we will meet again. This song is for you. Never let the colors fade away for if we shall never speak again, we will always be melted together by a four year blue." And thats where I was so close to crying it wasn't even funny. And then I gave it to Renee and she almost started crying. Yeah we were all just really sad. But the song was awesome. "So don't leave without crying/ Cause beautful friendships shed tears/ And let's scream to our futures/ Together an ending we will love/ Our beautful unborn lives..." Wow. Deep. I guess this the end of something big. But with every end comes a new beginning, we'll begin to watch our "beautiful unborn lives" unfold before our eyes...
