Tonight I've been ALOT of places man, me and Em went to Jack in the Box, Starbucks, the grocery store, and HOOTERS!! We had to go to Jack in the Box for Em for some tacos, then Starbucks for me, mmm caramel frapp ;), then the store for meine Mutter, and finally we met Em's ex at Hooters, and he was with Joe, the guy Kiera went to the Winter Ball with, who in fact is the biggest asshole, but has Kiera yelled at him?! No! Dude, if she doesn't, I will. You hear that Kiera?! Then me and Kiera started racing on the the road, lol I got to like 90 then my tires started burning, hehe, I'm so cool man!
