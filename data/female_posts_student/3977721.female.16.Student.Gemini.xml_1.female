Too bad no pokemon pinball. I missed that game. My sis’s gameboy cannot play. When I found the perfect game to play, the pilot said “We will be landing shortly”. Habis la my game.   It was quite fun in UM. A friend of mine forgot to bring soap to bath. In the end we threw a bottle of shampoo from one bathroom to another. I hope nobody sees the shampoo flying from one bathroom to another. =P. Then we are crazy enough to run up by stairs. Our room is on the 7th floor. By the time we reach the 5th floor, our legs we like jellies. We bump each other on the head also. Bang! So painful!!!!! My friend said she has a big “pau” on her head. While running, she also pressed the up button on every floor so that we will reach the 7th floor faster than the elevator. I heard the teacher say they thought got ghost! We also saw a group of girls who walk so fast(100km/hour) and shake the butt so hard. SO funny.   The competition lasted for two days. Their rockets so beautifully decorated. We were like died liaw. The judge said ours so transparent but we got 6 out of 10 for the design! Didn’t design also can get 6/10. Then got oral some more. We just crap bout our rocket. The ground was so muddy. My shoes were buried with mud. That reminds me I haven wash my shoes yet. GO wash later. Anyway, not bad la we got no 11, consolation prize. Out of 45 schools bo and only all-girls-team to win something. Girl Power!!!!!!!! The parachute time was 28.18secs. Improve by 18 secs compare to our Miri one. Oh well, it’s over already. We won must be because of your good lucks and help from God. Good enough!!!! .   We only manage to do a 4 and the half hours of shopping (shopping sounds so yucky. Exploring is more like it. What can I say, I don’t really like shopping.) Oh we met a few ppl too. (Nice knowing you!!!) And got this plastisin guy. He kept on asking for plastisin. Weird la. Then someone say he……………….. Hmmmmmm………. Better not say la. Now the band is going to Singapore. Can’t wait!!! Better study first then think of Singapore.
