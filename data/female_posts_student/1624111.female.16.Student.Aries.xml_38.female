"die you stupid [punch] bastard world! You cant  [punch] take this [punch] away from me. i wont [punch] let you. i will  [punch]  not  let this die [punch]. i'll be damned [punch] if you steal my friend [punch] my peace [punch] my sanity [punch] my emotional stability [punch] my happines [punch] my way of life [punch]. im [punch] stronger than [punch] this. and i will [punch] kick your [punch] ass. [spits and takes a drink of water] you cant have her [kick]" >:o  thats how you know when you have a real friend... you know, when they beat the crap out of an imaginary punching bag because theyre mad that they dont feel very close to you anymore.     or...maybe thats just me.
