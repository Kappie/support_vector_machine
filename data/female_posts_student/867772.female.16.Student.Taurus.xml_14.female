This is why I've promised myself one thing: I'm never, ever getting married. If you don't know already, my parents are divorced. It's the most fucked up thing I've ever witnessed. Two people, who supposedly "love" each other, make the biggest promise to each other anyone can make, and break it. Not just that, but they fuck up other people's lives too. I hate it. Then, if more than 50% of the people who get married get divorced, and I'm fuckin jinxed or something, which half do you think I'll be on? I don't want to go through all the shit if I already know how it's gonna end up. Plus, who would want to marry me?      Before my parents got divorced, I lived a fucking fairytale life. I lived in Las Vegas. I loved my school, friends, and pretty much everything else about my life. The only thing i would've changed is the fact that i didn't see my dad as much as I wanted to, because he worked a lot. Sometimes, on weekends, or whetever, my bro's and I got to go to work with him. He was the Director of Entertainment at Treasure Island. It was awesome when we did. Once my mom divorced him and moved here w/us, life was hell.      It's hard to believe how much I miss my old life. The thing is, it's not that I don't have my life anymore that gets to me, as much as knowing I'll never have it again. Some people get depressed because a loved one died- well, when my parents did this whole divorce thing, It feels like they did kill someone. Me. My life is gone. Now I have something else. Something, to put nicely, I hate to fucking death. There are the good times. You know, the little things, that allow you to function during the day. But in the long run, the "big things" show through, the shit that really matters. It's all so messed up that you can't handle it, and usually end up crying yourslef to sleep.      I might just be delusional. There might have been a lot of shit going on back when I was a kid that I had no idea about. But ignorance is a bliss, right? Whatever I don't know can't hurt me. I like it that way.
