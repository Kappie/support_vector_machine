Both were in a much more finished state than the introduction, however, so hopefully it won't be too difficult. with my new 10 pt font (yay!), i don't need to do too much ruthless cutting.   i tried out different writing strategies for drafting each chapter. with the first chapter (on material i'm less familiar with), i wrote almost as though i was writing in my journal. I wrote up on two or three pages on topics that i felt were relevant to the analysis, and connected them to form the essay. i also wrote nearly everything in third person: 'alice feels that _ author raises a critical point...' and then edited it into more formal voice. this strategy felt nice because it allowed me the mental space to work an idea through in a short space. i think this kind of strategy, where you are really doing the work for yourself and inserting yourself into the text, is also recommended for people who experience performance anxiety.    with the second chapter, on the material about which i'm most passionate, i did the every-college-writing-class-demands-it outline. chris lives by his outlines (and his lists) and they work for him.  it is very regulated for me and feels somewhat inorganic. i even set myself page length targets for each section (which of course i blew out of the water). i did this because the first chapter took ages to write, and my first draft deadline was looming. since i knew the material very well, the writing was fairly easy until the last section - which happens to be the few pages i've been wanting to write about since i began the MA program. my excitement about the material had too much presence on the page, and it took some serious work to find some form for that section.   i also tried to force myself to write shitty first drafts to get the words on paper, and then give them a substantial edit. i think this is a good idea, but it is discouraging to see crap from your own hand and i don't think i should so freely give the s.f.d's to my supervisory committee in future...   although i've been trying to break away from staid academic form for the last couple of years, i think i should learn to love something of it again.  i think i need to work on using form and structure to help me think through ideas - rather than spend ages writing them out longhand. in fact, the work i put into structuring my study within my proposal helped immensely in both researching and writing; i'm glad the overall structure of the thesis was never in question, which saved me from wasted hours on fruitless research and anxieties about the text's final form.
