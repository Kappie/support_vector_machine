(or is it suppressed? who knows the difference?) seriously. what's up with me? from the minute i close my eyes at night to the moment i open them in the morning, i dream and dream and dream and i wake up feeling VERY disturbed. don't even say i'm overanalyzing cuz i KNOW there must be a reason why i'm having these dreams. all i gotta say is, pasts really can follow you around like a twenty-four hour shadow.   other than that, i just wanted to document my discovery today that my dad is a big fan of Friends. he watches it right after the nbc nightly news with tom brokaw.  i only made this discovery today because i usually go upstairs right after dinner when the news broadcast ends. but today was different because i actually decided to do the dishes for my mom out of the pure magnanimity of my big gracious heart. but yeah, i was very very shocked to say the least. first of all, i can't believe that my dad likes something like that, something that i like. secondly, i can't believe that he understands all the jokes and laughs at all the right times. my dad's english is actually pretty good, but there's certain slang or certain references in pop culture that i guess i really underestimated his comprehension for. yeah. so now friends ranks right up there with three's company in my dad's book, and my respect for him has increased manifold.  i go to bed now. don't even THINK about coming near me if your name is anxiety-ridden dreams!!!
