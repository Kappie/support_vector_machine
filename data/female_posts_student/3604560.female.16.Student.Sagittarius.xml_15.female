Just watched The Day After Tomorrow today. It was GOOD! Ian Holm was in it! I love how Americans become illegal aliens in MEXICO! And their stupid money amd Americanism and their stupid stuck-up, we're-better-than-everyone-else-'tude can't save them from the ice-age. Bring on Fahrenheit 9/11! (Was that spelt right? Mel? That's your area of expertise). Anyone gonna see Spiderman 2? Anyone wanna see it with me during the holidays? I promise I won't talk during the film (much). Huh...that took time. And effort. I never realized that being a part of a blog meant actual participation...until now...  As they say, "When in Middle-Earth, do as Middle-Earthians (Middle-Earthlings?) do...  Namárië
