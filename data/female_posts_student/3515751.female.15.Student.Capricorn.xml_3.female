time I actually go to CF in peace…like I say, I never ask my mum lar…and through the whole morning…school lar…I’ve been thinking a lot…and I really can sense that something is not right….and that something is going to go wrong somehow…I felt so confused and worried…I felt so scared of what’s going to happen and will I be a ble to go for CF…will my mum just pop up in CF and say I’ve to go home…I really don’t know…I was very scared….and ended up…when school ended…I went to the toilet and then I went to put my bag and then went straight to call my mum…while I was waiting in the line, I was like thinking and guessing a lot…if my mum say I have to go home then how…and if she scold me how…but in the other hand…if she say okay then at least I think I won’t feel so bad kua…I really didn’t know…I was very scared…my heart was beating so fast…and when I dialed the number, she picked up the phone and I told her that I’m going CF and that Melissa is fetching me home…actually I wrote it on the white board in my kitchen already wan but jus tin case she don’t allow lar…and guess what she say….she say okay…I was like ‘okaylar…bye!!’…I was so happy lar…coz I got to stay for CF and I really feel a lot better….i felt no worries…there’s such great joy and peace in my heart…and also today….i never really talk much to the form 5s coz I dunno why…seems to slowly drift away already lar…I can’t really talk to them anymore…not much already…I don’t really know why lar but yarlor…I was with Joyce and Evelyn…and we talk a lot…yarlor…for a change lor…mix with others more…Melissa ushering mar and Tze Yuen she go toilet…and never return…so yarlor….at least I enjoy talking to Joyce and Evelyn…it’s nice chatting with them…at least it doesn’t remind me of any problems lar….today I’m kinda weird also lar…when I meet Joyce and Evelyn in the canteen, I saw Stefenie and Pei Wern and a lot more people lar…but I never say hi to them as if I never see them….but I never really look at them anyway…just make as if yarlor…but today was a kinda perfect Friday… in school today ar….let’s see…bm…class teacher plan the school carnival thing and we’re doing haunted house…and I’m the flier-girl…with Suk Teng and Pei Jie…but then I can be the ghost also if I want lar…but I have to see coz I scared I can’t make it for that day…got church lar….and James is suppose to give me the article…so see first lar…maybe I can ask my sis to help me get from him and yarlar…since the ghost thing…we started talking bout ghost a lot…eheh…and we were wondering if a small kid would go in and then got shock by the ghost and started crying…then how ar…the ghost comfort the kid…wow…ghost can comfort kids…that’s cool….how nice…friendly ghost…dunnolar…we’ll seeeeee….and then during moral…Cik Magdalene is our teacher lar and she ask us to go into groups and act out a drama using any of the nilai morals…and my group ‘kasih sayang’…and we came out with a story where a we get back results and then one of us did really badly…and couldn’t accept the fact lar…and wanted to die…jump down the building but then the other tow and the teacher stopped her…and so on lar…but hten ended up we didn’t do the dramam coz not enough time…wait lar…next lesson… and this Sunday….teach small kids…scary…hopefully they will listen somehow…and hopefully I don’t lost my temper…I won’t lar…I think….heheh…not so fast wan…but then the materials all also I haven’t get yet…I have to get it later…I just remember…dielor…so many things…nevermindlar…I’ll make it wan…besides that…I can’t really remember what already…ohyar…today during science in science lab, I and Melissa played a game call ‘look and don’t laugh’…through the whole game, so many interruptions…and we started so many times until the last time where we just stare and stare lar…neither one of us laugh and just stare and stare…but for me, I just stare lar and I was thinking of a lot of things…whenever I just stare at something too long already, I’ll start to think a lot…and that’s what happen lar…I just think lar…and the first thing I thought of is the time when my great grandmother pass away…when I was standard 5….although I wasn’t close to her and I only see her like less then 10 times a year…but she’s very nice…when she passed away, I was really sad and I cried…she wasn’t a Christian…and I was very disappointed…I just cried through…and as I stare at Melissa, my mind is drifting towards that very moment and Melissa changed into my great grandmother…and then after that, my mind flash to another scene…and Melissa turn into Stefenie now…and the sleepover night start to come back again…the time when Stefenie was just staring at us…and I didn’t dare to talk…I was just looking at her…my heart was beating so fast…I was about to cry and then I told her that I was the one who secret-mailed her and she said she knows and she’s proud of me…for telling her lar…and she gave me a hug…a big hug….but in my heart…I really don’t know…there are so many things…I felt so scared…I feel I’m lost…and I feel really bad…there are a lot of things in my heart that I never told her…and I dunno how to tell her…I didn’t dare to…all I did was smile and pretend like nothing…I was worried lar…and at that very moment Melissa look at me lar…the whole scene just pop off…and Melissa ask me whether am I okay or not…and I was kinda blur lar but I say I was okay and one thing is that…she say I was crying…I didn’t realize lar…but dunnolar…scary lar…just pausing for a moment can make me think so much…and in between all those thoughts there is also another thing lar…then after that, I just start thinking of why I’m still thinking of that lar…my great grandmother is not a Christian and that moment had really make me want to save each and everyone of my close ones…so many people is dieing and I really want lives to be saved…I don’t want to see people die some more…I’m scared…I dunno…that incident of my great grandmother’s death had motivate me to bring people to Christ…and I’m still kidna working on that lar…and bout Stefenie, I think it’s coz not everything is solve yet and nothing is done yet…and I’m worried lar…so yarlor…for now, I just don’t want to think of it…headache only…okay…today CF was soooooo SUPERB!!! they have testimonials and I just found out that Keshia only came to know God when she was form 1 and accepted Christ verbally when she was in form 2…that’s a surprise. and becoming a committee for camp is really tough…wow…I wonder man…and I bought camp t-shirt…it’s so nice…I got the camp book too…I love it so much…I think I will hug it to sleep tonight…today ended up really fun and it started really fun too…but then in the morning I got tummy ache lar…ate something wrong kua…but it went off after a while and came back again and I don’t care already…hehehe….okaylar…that’s all for now…bye!!! Love, Jovy.
