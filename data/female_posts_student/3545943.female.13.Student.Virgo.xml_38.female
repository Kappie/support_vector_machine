Quite frankly, I have absolutly no idea who this "Jen" person is. And that's kind of weird. So weird that it led me to google "Katio." And ya know what? 3,910 hits. Apparently, I am a language spoken in Colombia, not to mention half of a hyphenated land that's undergoing some problems with violence? Wow.
