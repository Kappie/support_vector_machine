And I love the lyrics under I Am... It's the theme song of that James Bond movie ^^;;; I love James Bond!! And as you all know, I am, in fact, a Bond Girl.   Among other things... Father's Day was fun. That kid L is the cutest thing since... ever! I taught him and his brother how to play FFX, and we just played that the whole night. *g* It was awesome. Neither were very good at it, but whatever. Unfortunately, I didn't get to show everyone the awesomest movie of all time -- Spirited Away. Have I gushed enough over that or what? It is  the  most imaginative, sweet, meaningful and fairy-tale-ish animation of all time. I loved it. The soot balls were too adorable for words... everyone must go see Spirited Away! Nownownow!   There are a bunch of strange guys right outside my window working on the deck. It is, to say the least, disconcerting. I woke up this morning to the sound of drills, yawned, blearily looked out the window (it was soo light outside), did a REALLY FAST double-take and was like wtf why are there strange guys outside my window!! I casually (heh) ran downstairs and freaked out and made my mom put down my blinds. It was funny. Scary, but funny.   My piano exam is on Wednesday. Ahh!! I don't know my scales yet!!! *dies* I will have to practice... tomorrow... :P :P :P Today I am far to engrossed in loafing. That's an awesome word.   Loafloafloafloafloaf...   I am the most anti-social kid of all time. I don't think I've gone to a movie with friends since like March. In fact, the most sociability I've had was going to K's 16th Wonderland party. And when P came over to volunteer. Jeepers creepers, I'm a hermit already... Although, I am getting some practise on my drawing skills. Which is always fun.   Strangely enough, I'm listening to Limp Bizkit right now. How weird is that? It all started with someone saying their theme song was Full Nelson, too. Bizarro. I've forgotten how tacky they are. And how they swear every other word. That's quite amusing, actually. I'll bet they write the song lyrics and are just like, "Let's see what happens if we substitute every second word with 'fuck,'"... I won't say what the result is, for fear of sounding too much like that which I'm insulting ^^;;   I'll stop blathering now. I don't know why I felt like writing such a long post, but whatever. It happens sometimes. I think, because I've hardly spoken to anyone my age for the past... year... that I'm talking to myself now. It's a safeguard from insanity. I don't think my body feels I'm quite ready for insanity, if this is what boring ol' sanity is like :P   One more thing!! I'll be in Quebec all next week. From this Saturday till... Tuesday. Or Wednesday. Add 10 days to Saturday, and I'll be back then. Ok? Funfunfunfun! I luuuurve Quebec. W00t!
