We have our own room and within thirty minutes of our arrival, I had our room looking like "our room." I even have pictures up of Shawn, Nick  I and of just Nick, too.  Today Miranda(my cousin), Nick and I ran errands and went shopping. I had so much fun! Of course, Nick and I got outfits for summer which  I  desperately needed! We had a very busy day-time flew by. For dinner, Grandma Lu showed me how to make Biscuits and Sausage gravy. It is soooooooo good! This weekend I am going to make Shawn some.  I really missed Shawn today. A few times each day, an overwhelming feeling comes over me and I think there is no way I can do this-raise Nick Sunday evenings thru Thursday-without Shawn's support. I miss him so much. He is an amazing man and I am lucky to have him in my life. This time apart has really made me appreciate our relationship so in that way, distance was a good thing, but I'm ready for him to be done with his internship and home! Thank "Gosh"( G'ma Jan, that's for you;) ) we have the weekends!  Falling asleep is hard without Shawn. At least I have Nick!  Nick is getting to be so smiley lately-I LOVE IT! This morning he was laying in his pack-and-play in the sun happy as can be. No matter what I said, he would kick out his legs and smile and laugh. It was awesome! He is so beautiful. Last night-while...very early this morning we snuggled and fell asleep together.-it is such a wonderful feeling to have him all snuggled up in my arms and sleeping. It makes me want to have  more  babies!-but when we wakes up and fuses, I know I can wait ;)
