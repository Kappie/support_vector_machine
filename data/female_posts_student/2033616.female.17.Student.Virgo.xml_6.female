While I was in Okoboji this summer... she came to our door asking "to play with the girl on the pogo stick."  MK spent some time with her that day and when Aliesha dropped me off at home that night there was a big chalk drawing on our driveway... compliments of Courtney and MK.  The first time I met her... Sam was here, we were working on Calling the freshmen.  She came to the door, which i answered... very confused to meet a little girl asking for my sister.  She asked me if I could play, and i gently told her that MK wasn't home and I was busy.  She came over 3 more times that afternoon... finally Sam and I walked she and her electronic dog back home.  She has come back to the house about twice a week since then, asking for MK.  Each time I've had to turn her down.  She has a brother her age, and a friend that lives just a couple houses away.  But she still comes over here looking for Mary Katherine.  She came to my door 10 min ago, and after the usual... "MK is not here" routine, she sheepishly asked, "is she ever going to get to play again?"  I feel like the bearer of bad news everytime she comes to the door.  Poor Courtney
