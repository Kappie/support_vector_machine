UGH!    anyway, i ordered udon.  mmmm... one of my favorite dishes.  and they had BUBBLE TEA!  oh my gosh, i looked so hard for bubble tea in rochester (obviously not hard enough!) and i just didn't think there were quality asian places around.  i was definitely wrong!  i was looking for something homemade and small... not a big chain restaurant.  something that would taste similar to alan's mom's food.  something that felt comfortable and warm and inviting.  this place did!  it made me miss alan a lot... seeing margarie's mom... hearing her talk.  i got thinking about the china trip i was supposed to go on with him and his family this summer... i SO wanted to go.  i love alan's family so much... it's difficult when you date someone for so long, you don't just break up with them, you break up with their family too.  "break up" is such a horrible term... sounds so cold and lost.  which isn't alan and i at all... this has been the most healthy break up i've ever been involved with.  anyway, i'm getting too deep into that... i was happy to have bubble tea and udon!!!!!!
