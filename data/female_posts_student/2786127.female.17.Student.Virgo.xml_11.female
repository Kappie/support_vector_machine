SOo... mr. nathan is back and he's completely ignoring me/indifferent about seeing me/being his normal lazy ass self. Its makeing me completely rethink this whole "get back together" situation. Whatevs.  I need to go to bed. I'm so on medication right now that i'm like in a weird dreamy state of mind and saying really weird things to people on the internet. And its late. and i have to go to school tommorow.
