DeJean has been one of the worst relievers in the Majors this season, not helping the cause on the awful Oriole pitching staff. Karim Garcia has had a bad season and was useless after the Mets traded for RF Richard Hidalgo. DeJean should not be used in any close game for the Mets, who would be better suited calling somebody up from the minors. Garcia may see some time at DH with Jay Gibbons and David Segui out.           Padres get:   SS Rich Aurilia (73 G, 261 AB, 27 R, 63 H, 13 2B, 4 HR, 28 RBI, 22 BB, 43 K, 1 SB, .241 BA, .304 OBP, .337 SLG)     Mariners get:   Cash or a PTBNL    And to think, the Mariners gave away All-Star SS Carlos Guillen to sign Aurilia this offseason. Wow. The Mariners had to trade or release him after designating Aurilia for assignment on July 10th so they gave him to San Diego where he will back up rookie Khalil Greene and Mark Loretta.
