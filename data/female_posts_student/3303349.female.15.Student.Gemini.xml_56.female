I toss and turn tring to rid my head of thoughts of you if only so I can sleep for a few hours. It's funny, you haven't even left town and I already desperately miss you. I love you. In such a short period of time you have penetrated my mind and my heart Even with you gone it is almost like you are here because i think of you every moment. YOu have become part of me and you have become my life. One of the few along the way that i have truely had a connection with. I readress your question; How much do I love you? I love you more than anything. With all my heart and all my spirit. I lve no one as much as I do you. The light sears my tired eyes and I go back to bed to be racked with more thoughts of you. But it is truely worth it. I love you.                           Halsey  I have so many fellings right now that they can't even be put into words. my head is realing tring to even find a solotary thought to write about. But one stands above the others and that is love. I can't belive I found it at fifteen or that it would have effected me as deeply as it has. But it is true. And it is killing me that I can't talk to Paul, the one that I love. I am alone now but I have regained my life before I found love. It really is nothing good. I have been forced back into reality and I must say that I have become quite fond of my dream world. I don't need reality. But i seem to be back here.   It is easyer not to miss when you occupy yourself and pretend like nothing is amiss at all. that seems to be what i am doing today. I watched soccer relentlessly and then occupied myself on keeping busy. It helps but I know soon Paul's absence will sink in. The feelings of sadness and lonelyness in the world have been pushed temporaily out of my mind. But just seeing the couples at the park today made me jelous because my boyfriend is away. The only thing that keeps me sane are the mere thought of his return and the whole future that we have layed out in frount of us.   I am running myslef in circles and therefor need to stop.
