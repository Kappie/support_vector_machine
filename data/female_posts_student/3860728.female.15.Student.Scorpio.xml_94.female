I didn't know it was 8.. i thought it was like 12 cuz i asked her to wake me up in time to see Maury.. i suppose this means she can't tell time. I went down stairs and ate pizza... oh yeah went to take a piss at like... 5am today and i got on the scale and i lost like 10 pounds... so i can eat whatever i want for the next few days i suppose. Uhhh i couldn't fall asleep after i ate the pizza so i called Amber and bothered her for about 20 minutes until she almost fell asleep on the phone. I tried out that mic Sunny gave me.. it was a dud... he stole it from skewl anywho (it has the skewls name taped on it). Certain boys suck as usual. I went back to sleep. Woke up about 4 or 5 hours later. Someone at my last slice of pizza.. most likely that fat ass jiro. OH YEAH. STACIA SENT ME " LET'S GET IT ON" aka THE BEST SONG OF ALL TIME. I guess that's all for right now... oh yeah.. i shall never eat another grape again... they taste good, but it'll fuck ur throat up. Hmmmm i am now on page 46 of Eidolon... another masterpeice by myself... ciao.
