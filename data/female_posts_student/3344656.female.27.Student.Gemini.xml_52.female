Anyhow, since after posting about losing 2 of my favorite DVDs, I found them (and one other that I didn't realize I was missing), I'm going to post that I can't find my copy of A Prayer for Owen Meany, which I'm really in the mood to read right now.  So I'm making do with Here Be Dragons.  I saw Cirque du Solieil yesterday.  It reminds me of all the things I loved about being in the circus, and makes me forget that I wasn't so good at it.  Realistically, the thing that I'd be best at are the contortion types of things.  Anyhow, I liked Varekai MUCH better than the last show I saw which was Alegria (in Biloxi MS, with an ex-boyfriend, right after the father of the quadreplegic man of whom I was taking care died, so it may have been situational).  However, Alegria is the only one that ever made me cry.  (again, may have been situational)  But the aerialists were amazing, the juggler was good (although he had a bit of an off-night), and the Russian Swing was amazing (they had a bit of an off-night too, which is a heck of a lot scarier than the juggler having an off-night).  I've found myself sort of jaded with circuses, so the fact that the Russian Swing act had me holding my breath says a bit of a lot.  It also reminded me of the Ani song "Freakshow" where she says "We live to hear the slack jaw gasping, we live under a halo of held breath, and when the children raise up a giant shield of laughter it's like the pending of death."   I'm working on my tan after I get offline.  It's time.  Remember last summer when I had all kinds of time to work on it by the pool?  Yeah, that was nice...  I had a migraine for most of Sat. and Sun. and even after 7 Midrin, 3 Maxalt, 6 Aleve, and 8 Mountain Dews, it didn't really ever go away until this morning.  So I'm feeling washed out right now.  And I'm posting more pictures on my yahoo site.  Okay, bye.
