I recently had a conversation with someone I had not talked to in a long time and it made me realize how much I truly miss him, andmissed missing him. So this is a sorry to him and the others that have somehow over time become to bea past and nota present part of my life...   Scott:  Thank you so much for caring about me and praying for me when we were younger. Tears come to my eyes just remembering the times in my life when you would pray for me and bring hope back into my eyes. You are an amazing person in every way and I hope your future remains as bright as you make it out to be. You are so optimistic and I love that about you. You have not changed in the year that we havent had an indepth conversation, and I hope you never do. I wish you luck on your wish to become a pastor; you would make a great one, and I would know as you were my own little pastor(Jeremiah 29:11, I still have it memorized). I am so sorry that high school and my own self conciousness and busyness has drawn us apart from eachother. I really wish things had worked out differently. You will always be special to me.   Ryan:  Although I have already repaired our friendship and been forgiven for the time I did ignore you and let what other people think get in the way of us, I want to say sorry again. There was a whole two years between our strong friendship and I want you to know that I feel very badly for making you 'non-existant' during that time and I never will try to rid you from my life. It obviously didn't work the first time, so I'm sure there is a reason why you are in my life and I will just sit back and let myself enjoy having such a fun great person in my life. I love you, Ry, and look forward to getting closer to my best friend, if that's even possible.   Tiffani:  We've been through a lot, and I'm glad I had someone there. I know you and I will always be best friends and we will always love eachother, but I also know there are things we just can't change and that there will always be a odd distance between us. I am sorry I could not be there for as much as you needed and I know you tried your hardest. I do not blame you for anything Fani and I love you dearly. Life is already separating us, and I hate it, but I don't know how to stop it. I just pray that we will always know how special our friendship was, and that it's not our faults that things didn't go our way. God has his reasons. I will never forget you.   Baily:  I'm sorry that I never took the time to get to know you, and that i judged you tremendously during the short time I did know you. I am sorry that I have much anger still and no one to take it out on but you. I know I shouldn't blame you but it's difficult not to. I know you would never have intendedto hurt anyone you loved, but it is hard to look backat everything Tiff went through and blame no one.   Moyer:  I know we have never talked about it, so I guess I'm just assuming what made us grow apart, but I also know my assumption has a lot to back it up. I am sorry for what I did to you, and I know it was wrong and I regret it more than you can ever understand. I'm sure college also took it's toll on our friendship, but I know that Tyler and I were probably a bigger reason. I was a fool, and I can only look back on it now and apologize to you.   Quentin:  I took a long time, but I am glad both of us have finally grown up and gotten over all the cruel things we did to eachother. There are many things I regret, but many things about our relationship and history that have helped me to grow and mature. I am sorry for the process of doing so. I know things will never be the same and as hard as we try we will never be as close of friends as we once were and that there are many things I did that you were undeserving of, and for that I apologize.   Jacob:  Thank you for everything, including forcing me to realize I could live without you and I didn't need to depend so much on only one person. The end of our friendship made me realize how many more people I had in my life to love. I wish you well in your life. I am trying my hardest to move on and I'm sorry for needing to know more from you than you want to give. I know things will never be the same, and that makes it hard to forgive.   Zach:  I do not know how much I hurt you, or if I even did, but I know some of the things I did to you were wrong and for that I apologize. You hurt me also, but I have moved on, and I hope you have done the same. There was a time in my life that you were important, and I'm sorry that it is no more. Thank you for the fun times we had. I learned alot from our relationship.   Sierra, Autumn, Summer, Jennie, Jamie, Haley:  You are all my most prominent grade school memories. I'm sorry that as we continued with school and grew up we lost contact and our friendships. I wish you all well in life.  Brittany:  I wish I had tried harder to save our friendship back in seventh grade. You were a very important part of my life when I was young and I apologize for throwing that away.   Ricky:  You hurt me tremendously during the short time we were friends, but I want to let you know I have moved on and that I only wish you happiness and hope you are safe and well. I'm sorry that circumstances at the time only made us hurt eachother. I'm sorry that I will regret every memory I have of you for the rest of my life, and I wish I had been strong enough to change that.  Most of these people will never read these, but no one has any clue how much more of a relief it is just to get it out somehow.
