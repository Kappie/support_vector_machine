I’ve broken your heart into pieces..  I’ve caused you so much pain  Tears had fallen from your eyes…  Sadness is what you felt…   I left your love behind  To test your love for me..  I tried to get you out of my mind  To prove myself I was “OVER YOU”..   Still in my heart  Can’t hardly move on…  These feelings so strong  Can’t barely forget…  I tried to pretend  I tried to hide  I tried to deny  What I feel inside..   Memries haunts me…  missing you makes me ill  Thinking of you …  Drives me insane…   AND NOW THAT… YOUR BACK…  You’ve proved to me  That your love is true..  Now I can see..   I’m ready to take this chance again  Hope your love is not slain  I love you with all of mine  Never get out of my sight   Hold on as we walk together  In this journey that would last forever..  This hands will be locked on yours..  Through joys and sorrows…   I’m yours alone  And promise to give all of me  Till this last breath of mine  Will be offered to you…
