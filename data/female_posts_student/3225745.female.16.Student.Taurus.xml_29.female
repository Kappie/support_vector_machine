Justin kept me up so late.  then he decided NOT to sleep in and wake me up right on time.  thanks. but it was awesome. yesterday we kicked this girls ass non physically and then we at dinner at chilis.  but then i got home and i was locked out. justin, being the kind sweet guy he is, waited with me.  then the weather got really bad.  it was scary.  and once again justin came to the rescue and let me stay at his house.  he is way too good to me.  i love him to death. no idea y he is still single. anyway he has the best dog, jake, i love jake.  soooo cute. so i got to bed around midnight and then woke up at 7 AM. again, thanks jray. then oh what happend the rest of the day? well i went swimming.  i love swimming.  just enjoying my time away from stephen.  hes gone to camp and i dont mind at all.  well...im gonna go get out the house.  its boring.  be back later.
