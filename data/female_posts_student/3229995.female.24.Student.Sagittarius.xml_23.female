This is good, Britney shows for the first time that she in control of her career and she is taking a couple of steps in the right direction.   Her last album  "Britney" was a definitive high, but if you (as me) isn’t that crazy about R then her new album "In the Zone" is a much more pleasant acutance. My first thought was that the graphic designers at her record company should have worked more on this terrible cover, "Britney" showcased a good cover design, this is amateur work. But music wise I was first extremely disappointed, her duet with Madonna "Me Against the Music" is NOT a good song and why, oh why, she has released this as the first single I don’t know. Well, I do know, because it is a song featuring Madonna, but that is just not good enough. Then comes yet another boring piece of work "(I Got That) Boom Boom" and you just think, the girl has lost it and you are so close to give her up and start listening to Christina Aguilera.   But then  the album takes a huge U-turn and the the 3d song "Showdown" takes you to the core of the album. This is saucy, sexy, sleek techno pop, not far from what you are used to from Kylie Minogue. "Breathe on Me" is truly a delightful song and this is when you realize that she is doing a Madonna. SEX is the word and in 1992 Madonna released her underrated "Erotica" album, and Britney’s "In the Zone" is in many ways the 2003 version of "Erotica". But where Madonna got down and dirty, Britney makes it light and sleek.    A string of songs   comes along, maybe not the biggest variations in theme and tune, but who cares? When you buy Britney you are not expecting a Kate Bush or Tori Amos, if you do you have big problem. I just have to give this album 4.5 stars because it is a good pop album and she gets an extra star just because I am so impressed.   "In the Zone"  has many rip-offs, there is defiantly some Mirwais inspiration here (he has worked on Madonna’s two last albums), there’s Madonna vibes and a lot of Kylie Minogue (if that is intentioned, I do not know, but it’s there).
