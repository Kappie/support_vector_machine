I dance abit and was packing my messy table..saw Terence's notes and CD..decide to keep them in a "Terence box" but then I thought to myself maybe there's something else I shld box... my past...  Putting the things together was hard especially Cosmo's photos.. I realise I can box everything of Seng into a tiny box.. cos then I'll require one of those "going hme" courier boxes tt stand up to my waist lvl... so a small box of important memories... I tried to find some notes he wrote to me but I think I brought it back to S'pore... I wrote a 6-pg long letter of my feelings... my eyes were pouring and I was listening to "First love" on repeat... saying phrases tt he'll say to me... and yah I juz wanna do all these things and neber to do so anymore... in future.. it's a huge leap for me... but I wanna be fair as well.. if Terence can say, "I only have you in my heart" I wanna say the same...  The next to box will be my guilt for D... I'm tryin to put tt away cos it's not tangible things tt I can act on and say tt's final... it's harbouring in my mind and conscious.. I'm always dreamin tt I'll see him somewhere on the street... and then I dunno y but I'm always with someone else.. or tt he didn't see me and juz vanish... and I always wanted to tell him what I feel but can't... hmm..someday in real time maybe.. for now, I'll find a way in boxing it up.. I'll find a way...  Dreams are made of all things sweet and nice.. but when dreams turn sour and nasty, who's gonna bear the rat?
