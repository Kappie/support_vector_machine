When the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips, you miss them? Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with them? Have you ever wondered which hurts the most, saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had? I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of. Because words diminish them, words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head. Don't be afraid to tell someone that you love them. If you do, they might break your heart, but if you don't, you might break theirs. Your heart decides who it loves and who is doesn't. You can't tell your heart what to do, it does it on its own, when you least expect it. Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was to afraid to let you. Too many of us stay walled because we are too afraid to care too much for fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all. Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever? Or maybe fell for your best friend in the entire world, and than sat around and watched them fall for someone else? Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle? We tell when we are afraid, afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us. But every time we tell a lie, the things we fear grow stronger. Life is about risks, and it requires you to jump. Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have, or could have had. You know you have something with that special someone when you two are sitting there in silence not saying anything to each other, but when you leave and you somehow feel that you had just experienced the best conversation you've ever had. That is something you should not lose."   yup. very thought provoking. and just before i read it, i was thinking to myself and i realized what my problem is. im too worried what other people might think. that might make no sense coz i claim that i dont care what people think. both statements are true. i dont care what people think, but i care what they MIGHT think. so once they think it i guess i dont care anymore coz i realize how little it affects me. i think thats why im so hesitant in everything i do. not only hesitant, but indecisive. EXTREMELY indecisive. sure sometimes i dont care, but sometimes i really cant make up my mind about certain things. back to what other people think. it bothers me. i worry. i know i shouldnt, coz when it comes down to it i COULD CARE LESS what the other person thinks of me and how they judge me. i guess i just worry bout what they MIGHT/WILL/COULD think. i dont know why i do that. coz what other people think, do, and say in regards to my thoughts and actions doesnt faze me. yup. i needa get rid of that worriness [is that a word?] of other peoples possible thoughts. i was thinking earlier and it hit me. many things ive done or rather HAVENT done have been affected by that stupid little fact that im worried of what people MIGHT think. i know this probly doenst make much sense. like its probly impossible to differentiate between caring about what people might think and not caring about what they do think. but there is a difference. and i can differentiate between the two. big difference. that little fact. its affected many of my decisions. many of my BIG decisions, and im not gonna get into detail. so. thats my problem. but how do i get rid of it? i need to push everythign aside. coz when it comes down to it, WHO GIVES A DAMN WHAT OTHER PEOPEL THINK? its all about me. i know its selfish, but when it comes down to it, its all about me, and whether im happy or not. i dont need the crap of not having ppl gossip about me and im dissatisfied with the decision ive made. its better to have ppl gossip about you and be happy. i think. coz i dont care. what they say is stupid. all that matters is that im happy. im not trying to come across as self-centered, and there is a difference between being self-centered and the fact that all that matters is my happines. there is a difference. ok. i feel as if ive been repeating myself over and over again and havent gotten my point across. do i even have a point? well i do, but then theres that other annoying fact that i am perfectly INcapable of expressing myself. the thoughts in my head are all jumbled up and i cant say them properly. ok. to sum up. i needa stop worrying about what people might think and focus on not only just my personal immediate happiness, but also that when im happy, that other people arent gonna get hurt in the process of me achieving my level of satisfaction, pleasure, euphoria, ecstacy, or any other word that can be used to describe happiness or whatever. yes. im blabbering on and on.  in regards to that passage i stole from kayel's page, it fit in with my thoughs too. coz some of the decisions that were affected by the possibility of ppl thinking low of me had to do with "love" or some other crap like that. [and yes, love can be crap]. anyways. that passage really has a good point to make. i like it. yeah.  ok i feel weird. as i sit here in this chair i feel as if i am levitating high above the ground in my chair. its a really weird feeling. i think its time for bed.
