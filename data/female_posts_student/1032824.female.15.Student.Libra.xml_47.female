However, the day became really depressing again after i got home. man, my mood sure does fluctuate hey. i received news from  mummy  that the  Iranian twins  have passed away. i turned on the telly to channel news asia and read, " Latest news: Second Iranian twin dies  at the bottom of the screen. * sobs * i feel for them. i sms-ed  amily ,  jess  and  kalyn (dingling) about it..   Anyways, i hope tomorrow would be a better day.
