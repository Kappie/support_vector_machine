Tim Foreman  [Does anyone really understand that? Maybe i'm just blonde... ;) ]    "to the world you might be just one person, but to one person you might be the world"  "the people who care dont matter, and the people who matter dont care"  "the greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, then walk out the door and deny Him by their lifestyle...that is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable"  "growing old is manditory, growing up is optional"  "do...or do not...there is no try"-yoda  "Be careful what you say and do, your life is the only Bible some people will ever read." - Dale Evans  "Show me your friends, I'll show you your future."

I worshipped science. Its advance had surpassed man's wildest dreams. It took many years for me to discover that science, with all its brilliance, lights only a middle chapter of Creation.   I saw the aircraft I love destroying the civilization I expected it to save. Now I understand that spiritual truth is more essential to a nation than the mortar in its cities' walls. For when the actions of a people are undergirded by spiritual truths, there is safety. When spiritual truths are rejected, it is only a matter of time before civilization will collapse.   We must understand spiritual truths  apply them to our modern life. We must draw strength from the almost forgotten virtues of simplicity, humility, contemplation  prayer. It requires a dedication beyond science, beyond self, but the rewards are great  it is our only hope.--Charles Lindbergh   No sciences are better attested than the religion of the Bible.--Isaac Newton   The need of the World is to listen to God.--Albert Einstein  The most important thought I ever had was that of my individual responsibility to God.--Daniel Webster  [I wonder if he's the guy who made Websters dictionary..hmm :D ]  The New Testament is the best Book the World has ever known or will know.--Charles Dickens  [and I was beginning to not like Charles Dikens..]  It is better for me to be a martyr than a monarch.--Ignatius  [i wonder who he is]  [I can't beileve you read all these quotes..they are all so cool!]  I account the Scriptures of God the most sublime philosophy.--Isaac Newton  [Sublime!

Because it seems like alot of the good artowrk out there (nature seens and such) are just reprodustions of the already perfect art God made of the world]  "Peace is always beautiful."                                      --- Walt Whitman  "We will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." -- Martin Luther King, Jr  "A democracy without values is easily transformed into an underhand totalitarianism" -- John Paul II to the Italian Parliament, November 2002  "Goodness is the only investment that never fails." ~ Henry David Thoreau  "Et tu, Brute?"
