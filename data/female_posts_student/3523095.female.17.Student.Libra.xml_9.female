Today is a super long day. And when I mean super long…..its SUPER LONG!!! Me came bek at 9.50pm today. Ate dinner and then here I am. As usual, I have the Monday blues. And today is no different. I got back my Lit paper today. Wasn’t a pretty sight. I know that my paper has been marked very very very leniently and yet I managed to score a miserable 47 for 4 of the questions. The last question wasn’t marked…..that means that my paper was so terrible that it wasn’t worth marking till the end. Fine. My fault. I did read the book ok. I did. Then I cut mass pe today. But with the teachers permission of course…she told me that I have to make it up for her….alright…and you wanna know my make up PE??? 8 rounds round the track..8 rounds dammit. You’d probably be thinking why I was so stupid as to cut class and tell my teacher and summore get a make up pe lesson. Well well…what can I say??? The banner remains unfinished. And we were supposed to hang it up today. Still undone. There is 2 more to do…12 meters by 218 cm??? Think it can be done??? I really hope so. And if I hadn’t told mrs loh….manikam will be after me… rather run the 8 rounds than to stand outside the pulse [the posh word for the staff room in my college.] and get a lashing from him. Me went to lot 1…got them some food… came bek….paint and add glitter. Till this point, things are near perfect. And I am still in a jolly mood. C’mon with vin and ash ard…..and their dirty jokes, one has to be anti social to be in a bad mood. I washed up…..in the guys changing room with those two and then left school at 9+. When I reached the interchange….i saw the looooong queue for the 300. my goodnessss…It went all the way to the macdonalds in the mrt station. It was that long you know. as usual I cannot wait. Then I overtook this one bastard and crossed the road in my usual fashion….not at the traffic light…and yeaa… me leave it at that. I know I’d get a scolding from nanda.  Once me reached the busstop….the bastard….put his smelly plastic bag next to me and walk ard the cement thingy that hold the MRT up [I know this is rather crude English. Just adjust ok?] and then he started talking to me….some moron trying to sweet talk me in the middle of nowhere…what?? Gimme a break larr…and he looked absolutely filthy I tell ya. The fucker probably trying to get my handphone number. Asked me to send ringtone to him. What the??? Totally nutty fella. Then I half screamed at him. And then…after this looooong pause…he still got the cheek to tell me to give him my number so that he can send me ringtone. That really made me blow. I screamed at his face….and asked him if he wants to spend some time in jail for harassment….the asshole face changed. Luckily this pregnant lady sat next to me….and he cldnt move his filthy plastic bag closer to me. She kept looking at my school logo….then she smiled. That sorta cooled me down….then I took the bus…that moron also got in.....ask my bro to fetch me bek home….haizzzz  Life. Such useless beings still exist…you know, I don’t agree with the men are from mars and women are from venus thingy….i think women are from earth and men??? From the other side of the milky way….or maybe the 10th planet that was found recently….SETNA!!!! I hereby change the slogan…men are from SETNA and women are from earth…jesus!!! Speaking of who…I didn’t call caroline. I have enough things on my hand already. I know jesus knows that and I hope the lord forgives me….aint my fault. I just got no time!!!! And now…..the stupid PW is pending. Goodnessssssssss!!!!  I got lots to rant. Am never finished. But it seems too long…me will stop here.  Nites Bubbye
