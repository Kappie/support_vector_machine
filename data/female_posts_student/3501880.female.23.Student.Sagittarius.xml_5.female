Watching:  The Seventh Seal   Mood:  An amalgamation of tired, productive, sick, and complain-y ___________________________________ Don't tell anyone, but I am in the law library working on a research project for my boss, and I really have no clue what the fuck I am doing. Top it all off, my throat hurts (but it's not strep), and my mind keeps wandering.   The good news: Talked to the financial aid lady about my aid for next year. I feared that I would probably have to borrow privately, which would require me to ask my dad to be a co-signer. I REALLY didn't want to do that at all. It is time for me to cut the apron strings, folks, which will require me to figure out how I am going to fund my way through school, without having to phone up my father and whine, "But, DDDDAAAAAAAAAADDD! I need MMMMMOOOOONNNNNNNNEEEEEYYYY!   Lo, the Gods happened to be smiling upon me today, and I found out that my financial aid package would not require me to borrow privately. Thank you very much! One step closer to taking care of shit by myself. *pat on the back*  Earlier, I had to run home to get my laptop and the charger for my cell phone, and I kinda absent-mindedly started backing out of the parking space. I checked...really, I checked behind me, but apparently there was a car speeding behind me, which I almost hit...The key and very essential point to this story is that I DID NOT HIT THIS CAR! I just almost did...  However, this bitch freaks out, slams on her brakes in the middle of the road, and gets out of her car, and starts walking over to mine. I notice that she is a law student as well, and I have talked to her a few times. Also, we have a few mutual friends. She starts screaming, "You almost hit me!!!!!" and then judging by the look on her face, she realized that she knew me as I said "Sorry". Very dramatically, she flips around and storms back to her car.   I understand she was mad. Hell, I would have been pissed off, too, and would have given the well-deserved finger. But, chill the fuck out and just keep driving. I am not sure what was accomplished by her getting out of her car to briefly yell at me when I didn't even fucking hit her car. She ended up just looking like a big-ass bitch, and my indifferent opinion toward her has been blemished. Not that my opinion should be worth preserving, but you get the point, it was just the dumbest thing I have experienced in awhile.
