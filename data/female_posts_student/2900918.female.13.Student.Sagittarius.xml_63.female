I hated that German idol. He was bony and he wore a sleveless[issat how u spell it?] top. I thought to bear with his looks cuz maybe he is lik clay aiken [ugly at first, but a w-h-o-a! voice]  But I was so definitely wrong.   He sang some karaoke techno song, *typing the word "techno" makes me wanna puke* , which sucked. It was horrible! And his excuse was, "Because everyone  wus  singing a ballad, I wanted to sing an upbeat song."   I dont hate upbeat songs, but he... how should say this.. well, he sucked!!!  I hope part 2 doesnt disappoint me lik part 1. I'm lookin out for kelly clarkson and kurt neilson[the world idol]
