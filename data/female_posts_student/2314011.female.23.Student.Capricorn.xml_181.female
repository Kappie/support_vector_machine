Thought I'd drop by and pick up everything I'd left; needed some distance from all the books, paper, shelves and dingey old books.  Putting the books I didn't sell back on Half.com, trying not to think about how much I paid for them as I set the sale price.    It's weird being here now:  all the empty desks, some cleaned out, some apparently recently used.  Enjoying the Wi-Fi, but will be happy to leave this place behind for good this afternoon.  Think I'll spend the afternoon at the Grind, catching up on web surfing and reading.  Yay.   Yea, gonna go through all the notebooks and trash all the precious notes, sort out what needs to be kept and lock it all away in the big gay office upstairs until it's needed again in three months.  Think I might take the long route to the Grind, too.  The day is trying to be nice, with the Superman Blue sky peeking in around the gray rainclouds, but it's still too nippy to enjoy sans the protection of windows.    Good times.
