The road curved, and a dark expanse, darker than the road, darker than the trees, came into view, an endless black hole seemingly stretching forever.  She was driving too fast.  But she had to get there.  Now.  If not, she'd never do it.  A feeling of panic and dread rose within her.  Can I really do this? Can  YOU  really do this, Kristy?  Of course.  There is no other way.  She wiped her forehead with the sleeve of her black hooded sweatshirt. She realized that she was bathed in sweat. Hot and sticky, Kristelle rolled down her window and placed her arm outside the car.  What is  wrong  with you?  You can  do  this.  It'll be easy.  STOP SIGN.  DAMNIT! Why is there a fucking stop sign way the Hell out  here ?  She blew through it.  I DON'T FUCKING CARE!  Kristelle clicked on the radio, turning up the volume so she couldn't hear herself think.  As she drove, she tried to clear her mind, letting the music roll over her thoughts, letting the music push out everything she didn't want to think about, concentrating on it, flowing with it as if the music were driving the car, carrying her forward, carrying her away, away from home, away from people, away from her life.  Life. Life.  The word played over and over in her mind, repeating itself until it seemed to have no meaning.  Every once in a while, she would raise her eyes to the rear-view mirror and wonder if she should just turn around and go home.  Then she would quickly return her gaze to the highway and let the music carry her away.  I can't go back. I've come too far.  I'm too close.  SO close!  LOOK!  She could see the flashing-orange lights of the Toll Booths looming ahead.  The Mackinac Bridge.  I'm there!  There's no line, it's empty. No one here?  Cars pass through on the left, correct? Yes, I'm sure of it.  As Kristelle approached the booth, she slowed to a stop, and then she gunned it, crashing through the metal barrier lever.  I'M NOT GOING TO FUCKING PAY THREE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR THIS!  She could feel the thoughts in her mind whirl around as if they were poisonous gases floating in an empty, open space.  Her head was reeling.  The bridge.  I'm here.  I'm here. I'm here.  What now?  Lake Huron on one side, Lake Michigan on the other.  Ohh, it's so beautiful.  Her mind was racing with thoughts. So many thoughts. Dangerous thoughts. A pretty girl her age should not be thinking what Kristelle was thinking. She shouldn't be there.  I shouldn't be here, she knew.  I shouldn't be, but I am.  And this is the last place I'll ever be, the last place I'll ever go, the last place I'll ever see.  Still driving too fast, induced by anger, Kristelle slowed at the first huge concrete pillar of the bridge and stopped shortly after. She exited her car, walking toward the East side of the empty bridge and looked out over Lake Huron, crossing her arms and thinking.  This is amazing.  I'm going to die here, and the view has already taken my breath away.  At the edge of the bridge the dark water sparkled under the full moon.  Amazing.  Kristelle looked directly beneath her. Water, but shallow, and rocky, she knew.  The perfect place.  She reached out for a cable attatched to the bridge and hoisted herself onto the enormous railing.  Memories suddenly flashed through her tattered mind. Memories that had brought her here. Memories that she didn't want to have anymore. Sad memories, tragic memories, all harsh, all so painful.  Kristelle could feel her anger start to build.  It always started in her chest, a heavy burning feeling. She could feel her chest tighten. Then the anger spread to her neck muscles. Then she felt the familiar throbbing at her temples.  I WANT TO DIE!  With a pained sigh, she turned and glanced in the opposite direction, toward Lake Michigan. The view just as breathtaking.  She giggled for some reason. A high pitched giggle.  The anger was still there, but she was beginning to calm down. The throbbing in her temples stopped. Her neck muscles relaxed.  She looked down again and gasped. I'm scared, there's no way I can do this. I have to get away from here. She moved, edging on the railing, still grasping the metal cable.  Careful.  But as she turned around - maybe she was nervous, maybe scared, or maybe she was deranged - she stopped, a strange grin on her face, and leapt backward off the bridge.  As she cascaded into the air and plummeted towards the roaring mercy of the Great Lake, her last utterance was carried with the winds, "Swallow me whole my love! The sweet kiss of death is my last request."
