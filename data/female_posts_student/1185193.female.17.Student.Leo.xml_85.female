Also, at 9am everyday, I do a "Starbucks Run," where I get everyone what they want from the Starbucks downstairs.  And then I later do a lunch run (same idea except I go to places like Subway or Le Bou).  And the people who work there are soooo nice.  It is a women runned office, so only one man works there--the husband of a woman who already works there.  I thought I would feel like a high schooler--like a bit inferior--but I didn't.  It was awesome.  I look forward to next time!  PS:  Everybody go see Raising Helen...it is a great movie :)
