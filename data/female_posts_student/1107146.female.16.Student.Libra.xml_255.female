FIGHT!   come on i'll get the boxing gloves and we can all come watch Rosie get the living daylights knocked out of her.  does any one else want to see this happen?  it would be the event of the century ? Maybe we should charge admission...and invite Becca.  wow this sounds like fun. when do we want to have this titanic showdown between a small asian girl and a short italian boy?  who will win? the one with the Mafia backing him? Or the asian?  maybe Josh should train by watching jackie chan movies and planning how to counter small asian people who attack with lightning speed.  should rosie spend her time studying pressure points?  will the Mafia arrange this fight just like it has so many others?  so many questions with only one way to answer them.  be sure you don't miss the fight of the century, small spastic asian vs. short mob backed italian.  now calm down both of you.
