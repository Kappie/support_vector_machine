We went to the station where we got on a train and well to show that our day was already gona be weird the trains were going o the opposite platforms compared to usual and well that was confusing... just before the train pulled away we saw tim....*absolute losty* on the station...he was going to kirawee and yes tim we know u like that chick...dun worry ur secrets safe with me and jenny *cough cough*. we met antionette at hurstville station where we caught a train to redfern and i dont care whether u think it was peak hour or not girls....the train was still packed like an asian household in china!!!...we changed trains and went to burwood where we started our long walk around looking at clothes and accesories.... ant was a lil dissapointed with buroowd but jenny still managed to pick up a bargin...it got a lil boring so we decided to catch a train back to good ole hurzy...well this train triphad its share of weirdos too!...apparentyl (cause i ddint see anything but ant and jen spot it) was a man with a phone camera...SORRY have to edit that....it was a full on digital camera...no a phone..wat a freak (HOW DID I MISS THIS) who moved near us and took pictures and then pulled out a video camera....ONCE AGAIN - how i missed it i duno but jenny very subtly made us move 2 carriages down without me totally going why do we have to move for lol?!?!"...back at hurstville we were in our natural environemnt....antionette got called into work and so after we had our tucker she left us and went to her delicatessan. We met Charles, Phil, Daniel and their friend Gab (who looks like hs is about 10 but anyway) and boy do those boys like to shop....they bought more then us girls lol...so basically the rest of the day til about 5ish was spent hanging round hurzy with the guys..we were gonna get phil to try on girls clothes for us but after his detail description of what his "man hairs" would look like in a skirt..we decided STRONGLY AGAINST IT!!! jen and i left at about 5ish and well the day was over..very long and tiresom due to all the walking lol... even though bushweek was over we still saw alot of familiar faces around the place...michael peck, chris peck, sophie, chealsea, etc etc...boys were amazed that all we did was shout out to people constantly wen we saw them lol...even tho there is no need to shout to antionette.she hears my woof whistle and comes running hahaha (she knows shes wanted =P) Since i have been home i cant handle it....my sister the 2nd youngest one has been an absolute bitch!!!....blamming me for everythin that has gone wrong..i had to lock her otu and me into the office out the back to save me from hitting her...the lil shit really doesnt know when to stop....she thins she is always right and well really doesnt know how to be a smart ass or use sarcasim in a fight....gives me the shits more..PHHEWWFF....needed to let that out. oh and just before i finish this lil blog i have to say last night jenny sent me a lil video clip thing and told me to watch it....not onyl was i watchign it and thinking WTF casue it wasnt working properly on my computer but it was in KOREAN..i coudltn stop thinking "I duno about u jen but i dont get this asian bullshit"...it wa something about some girl going blind and the man that loves her giving her eyes to him....i guess that k
