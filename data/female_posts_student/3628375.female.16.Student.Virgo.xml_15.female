Missy's mom hit a nurse and her mother-in-law today and instead of taking her to jail for assault, she got put into a mental hospital!!! I can't even think right now. My mind is so twisted. I need to be with Missy, she's my bestest friend in the whole world and I'm not there for her!!!!!! I don't know what to do but I know I have to be there for her. I'm going to the hospital soon when my sister comes and gets me, Sandra's coming too. This shit is just SO crazy! I mean, come on, these things aren't supposed happen. I'm like in a frenzy right now!!! Well I'm going to go. Later! ~*CaSeY*~
