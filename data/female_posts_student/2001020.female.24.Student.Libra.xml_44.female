I'm still at home for Thanksgiving (lovely) but reality is coming back to bite me in the arse tomorrow when I return to school. YIKES! Ten days till my first final, yeah, I'm freakin' out. Um, what's new in my life? Well, there's a new guy, kinda scandalous b/c he used to date one of my friends, so I'm keepin' it on the DL. It started out as a FB relationship, but I'm finding that it's becoming more and more emotionally involved, on his end and on mine, which is weird...aren't these things supposed to be detached and uninvolved? Who knows. We get along well, although we're really really different...it's nice. Maybe it's because law school is just a lonely,lonely place, and we all need someone to cling to. I think that's the answer, b/c he just isn't the monogamous dating type. I knew that from the get-go, so I didn't set myself up for any sort of heartbreak...but I'm starting to find that maybe I was wrong about him. But don't fret! I'm still proceeding w/caution! I am not stupid! I've been burned too many times to be blind...but not to be hopeful ;)
