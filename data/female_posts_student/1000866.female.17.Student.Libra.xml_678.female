I mean, I love having my old friends too but, new friends are nice and getting to spend more and more time with them is getting to be awesome.   Anyway, we all had a bbq at Hunters Woods tonight. It started out as Jeremy, Stephen, Kathryn, and me. But then...a ton of people ended up coming. Amit, Tom, Roger, John, Matt, Faisil, Jamal, Chen, and Sophie and some other chick even showed up for a bit. Crazy fun times. The best part though...other than Tom lighting everything on fire...was definitely learning to fish. Jeremy taught me how and I caught like...four fish. It was so fun. I refused to actually touch the bait or fish though...heh. I'd be a terrible fisher. But, yeah, it was lots of fun. I love spending time with them. I'm getting to be much better friends with Stephen and Tom too. It's too bad Tom's moving in July. Big time bummer. That's ok.   Summer school actually isn't bad either. All I'm doing is reading all summer. I was originally going to take Consumer Ed. but decided to go with Lit. Themes instead. I was close to quitting band and just going without summer school. If I did that I'd easily get all my credits. Oh well. Lit. Themes is fun. All we do for the two hours is read which, I'd be doihng at home anyway probably.  I'm in a decent mood right now. :) Happy, happy, happy. Tomorrow, I have kind of a busy day. I have summer school then a lesson with Lubrielle, who's supposedly really, really good. Then, I have a meeting about the walking marathon for the Cancer association and then I'll probably go hang out with Kath, Jeremy, Stephen and some other people. Good times. Good times indeed. Bon soir my friends and people I don't know who read this thing.
