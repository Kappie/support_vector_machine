I wish that I could see him today but I have to clean so that Cierra can come over. I'm sooo nervous about her coming over. I'm afraid that there wont be anything to talk about with her. Im so scared..AHH! :( Anyway..I guess that I should go now, I want to find ANOTHER blog skin because the one I have sucks. blah...Ill write later.
