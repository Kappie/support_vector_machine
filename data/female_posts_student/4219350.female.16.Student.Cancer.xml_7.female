Then, I try to post, and what happens? I lose all of my lovely writing. It was some deep shit, and how I had found the cure for the comman cold and stuff like that. But it was all lost. Dam stupid thing. I'm sick of you already. I didn't even make it a week. Wow, this is a new record for me. Usually it takes two hours for me to hate something with a passion. But blogger did it in maybe half an hour. I applaude you blogger, you have been added to the list of things I hate. I'm still going to use it though. Because Jamie did this all for me and I want to use it for a little while before I say, you know what? I don't really feel like playing with this anymore.  Anyway, yeah I'm not going to try and write something deep and meaningful, considering the fact that this most likely won't work. Stupid internet and computers and everything computer related. I hate it all. It's all evil. Yes, I use the stuff, because there isn't very much chance that I'll go through life without coming in contact with it. But I would still like for it to be destroyed in a big ball of fire. Fire is kind of cool, except when it burns you, then it's bad. Bad fire, behave yourself, don't hurt me. Yeah, I'm hungry... if I had a robot that made me food, then I would probably like computers. Robots are cool, except for the ones that kill people. Those things are scarey. I don't want to be near them. You know what else is scarey? Clowns... how can something be that happy all the time. Except for the sad clowns, but they are even worse then the happy clowns. All mopey and wanting attention. Clowns are attention whores. Though so am I, so I have something in comman with clowns. That isn't good. I learned a new word today. The word is zenith. Look it up, it's kind of cool. I wanted to use eggbeater.blogspot.com for the url, but can you believe it, someone had it already. What kind of sick, twisted person uses eggbeater for a name? Actually I think it's kind of cool. Anyway, in closing: Thank you jamie, and I hate blogger. Spell check also sucks ass.
