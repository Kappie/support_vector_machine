The ride there wasnt terrific, eight + hours in a SUV with 6 other people, two of them being babies. Finding a spot to stretch out and sleep was a chore. My bro-in-law had just recently bought a portable dvd player for the way there so the kids wouldnt get crabby. But according to murphy's law, everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. The dvd player broke for no apparent reason.  So that sucked.   We arrived at our hotel at maybe, 6 or 7 in the evening (we left at 10:30 in the am) My mother and my sister and I went to a dinner that was put together by the grooms parents. Also boring. Then went back to the hotel and went to sleep.   The next day we all got ready and went to my cousin's wedding (thats why I went down to kansas) It was a very pretty ceremony, but very very short. The reception kicked a lot of ass. Haha. Dancin' like mad. Then went back to hotel and slept. heh.   We left the next morning to go home at about 10 and made it back at about 5:45. Once again, tensions build in a vehicle of the Kuffel family.    I cleaned up a little around the house and then went off to Ryan's to have some fun. Jesse was there too. Yeah! We drove around uptown a little bit, went to cheapo, drove some more, then chilled at Jesse's. It was GOOD fun, great fun. I got home at about 3 am. So yeup, its 4:20. Time to sleep. Goodnight everyone!   $kuff money$
