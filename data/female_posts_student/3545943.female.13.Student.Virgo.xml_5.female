Maybe a little more mature, a little beyond the giggling bikini-wearing teenage girls that make me so disgusted with society.  I have low self-esteem and high expectations for myself.  I'm hard on myself.  I can't figure out what I want to do with my life, even a vague idea.  I keep putting off the things that I do want to do, like my novel.  I have a feeling it will never be complete.  I just drag through my days, they all blend together, each seems just like the last.  I don't  do  anything.  Nothing that matters.  And then I hate myself.  But then I realised, I'm only thirteen.  Assuming I don't die a premature death, I have most of my life ahead of me.  I don't  need  to know what I'm going to do with my life, as long as I have that initial desire to do something worthwhile.  My sister is going to be a senior in college, and she doesn't know what she's going to do.  My other sister is going into college with no idea as to what her major will be.  I've got time.  I think I need to relax a little, be a little less uptight.  Allow myself to make mistakes, knowing I can learn from them.  What good will it do me to wallow in my depression?  I'm not saying I can just put everything off until my last year of college, but I have plenty of time ahead of me to learn and grow as a person.  To explore new possibilities and figure out what it's all about.  It's okay for progress to be slow, if it is careful and strong.  I think I'm going to go work on my novel now.
