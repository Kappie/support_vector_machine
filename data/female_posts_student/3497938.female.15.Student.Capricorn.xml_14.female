Except for Katie, not saying she is boring or anything. *lol* I'll probably talk on the phone tonight, get a shower, blow dry my hair, go to bed, then wake up and go to church. *YAY* Then we are going to Whitewater... I have never been, so it should be fun. Plus, I get to see Drew. Maybe I'll post again tonight if I remember. But right now, grandpa is here with food! Chick-fil-a is the bomb!!!
