       
      Busy day today.  We had some work done on the house and so there was lots of noise and dust flying.  I retreated to the mall where I bought some makeup, gifts for various people I'm going to see while I'm at school this coming week and some reading glasses.  Not much else new. Quiet now that the work is done.  More to come...
