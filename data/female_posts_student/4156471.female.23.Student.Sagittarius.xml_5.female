Well,  we were invited to a bbq last night organised by Jeff Seidel.  Someone sponsers this dude's organisation and they function like missionaries Jews for Jews.  They have established a centre just for us equipped with internet and washing machines.  They will be having lecutres and Talmud tutors... and guess what else?  They are offering stipends to for people who want to do continous study with them.  (Dad are you jumping for joy yet?)  The thing is.. that I want to learn Talmud with them anyways, I woud do it even if they weren't offering the money.  The same organisation also sponsered this Jerusalem trip.  I opted to stay here and relax instead.  I'm not in the mood for touring and socialising all weekend.      Every day here increasing my realisation that I"m in genuine heaven.  My new friend Kara asked me if I wanted to work out with her.. so I was at the gym for the first time.  And working out felt brilliant.. working it to the techno unde blue and green lights in a really friendly atosphere.  And after working out just walk out to the pool for swimming and tanning!  And for dinner?  WAlked across the street to my home and prepared myself a guacomole salad for dinner.  Its like .. how can you not be healthy when all these healthy options are layed out before you.    The hebrew is really challenging.  I'm really awful and memorising things  especially minute details like where letter go and when.  But I love the classes.  Our teacher is wonderful, and she's going see about gettting us Rechov Soom-Soom (hebrew sesame street that we used to watch in elementary school).  We get to sing kids songs in class and read kids books.    Its weird cuz I feel like I"m in the position to serve as a model for some of the OSP kids.  Like soem of the girls I"ve met seem to be super insecure ( as I was when I was younger as well).  and then I say things like " oh, the first test doesn't matter... its beneficial cuz it just show you what you need to improve on"  and my friends eyes lit up like that never occured to her before.  And this other guy was just amazed that I like to dance and didn't need to drink first.  COME ON!! Dancing is the best thing to do with your limbs  best utilize that ability right?    Now here is a note to anti- americans.  for those Canadian who look down on American.. my trip is proof that there is no difference betwee nus and them except maybe environments.  The kids on this trip are sweet and super super intelligent and political and not at all ignorant or snobby.     I"m looking forward to a week of tanning and swimming and writing letters and oing hebrew homework.  Sunday is the first day of the week here so tonight is like friday night.. except stores are still open.    Right let me say one more thign abuot the germans.  as I think I already said in the blog... the ulpan consists of both germans and americans ( and soem token canadians).  The majority of the Germans here are not jewish.  At first that kind of puts confusion in my heart.  but apparently Jewish Studies is a big thing in Germany.  I made firends with a girl from Romania yesterday.  She isn't jewish but she won a scholarship to come here for the summer.  She does jewish studies at home.  now the eve weirder thing is that the majroity of the germans are even better at hebrew than I am!!  crazy eh?  seems almost liek it shoudln't be.  But kudos to them to taking an interest in us eh?
