Ahhh... so refreshing clearing out my spam e-mail, you wouldn't believe how unlucky I am! I delete every chain message thingy, cbb really. Yeesh, do I really give a damn about tax when I'm not even old enough to do anything about it? I don't want any INK THINGIES! (Really losing my grip on spelling! cartridges? *didn't wanna put it in caps incase it was wrong :P *) Ahh good old Manu Chao... always gets me crazy! (That's better than uncrazy) (usually) I've been having fun with my ears, they've gone all clogy and deaf *almost wrote death... just typed almoist* (Eugh) Yeay! I'm in a happy, nothing's too much to ask mood! Oh dear... some thing usually goes wrong when I'm in one of these hyper moods. Ah well... that's hyperness of life! Really not making sense... go. watch. friends. good.
