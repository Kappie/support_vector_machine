Do you have any recurring dreams?   I used to when I was younger.  I would dream that I was falling down cliffs, buildings, etc.   3. What's the scariest nightmare you've ever had?   Dont remember.   4. Have you ever written your dreams down or considered it? Why or why not?   I would like to, but I would never remember them.  I take so long to actually wake up that this, sadly, is not an option.   5. Have you ever had a lucid dream? What did you do in it?   If I did, I didn't remember it.
