Then me and Sara were going to eat at Krystal's so we could talk about some stuff and we saw Joseph so he came to eat with us. Then we went over to Lisa and Emily's and hung out there for a few hours and then my mom picked me lisa and sara up and took us to eat AGAIN because my cousin wanted to see me. Yeah, I got the juice today. FINALLY. I cant name names or say specifics, but I am so proud and happy for her. Lol, I just cant believe it..But now that definitely means I'm next because she's covered all the bases that I've said I was going to cover with all that, and its going to happen now. But the deadline for this is next weekend, because we always do it in sequintial order, so I HAVE to get to it..Wow, I'm still in shock. I thought I would be the one...but i guess i havent had the oppurtunity lately. So, I guess I'll just find out this week, wont i?
