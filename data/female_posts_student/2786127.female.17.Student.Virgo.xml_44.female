I want to get into really good shape this summer, I'd feel so much better about myself, and terribly proud.I need to start on that immediatly...i feel like i don't do enough for myself, and its really bringing me down.   When you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else...just a perfect reflection of you and no one else...  -Guster.   I want to go wakeboarding! AHH!! I dont want to take my french and math final tommarow. oh well. Then summer! after wednesday... But wednesday is going to kick because Seifs and Bains are takeing me makenzie genie alex and lindsay to lunch after our finals. Best. Teachers. Ever.  Must clean room...getting high off disenfectants....can't. focus.
