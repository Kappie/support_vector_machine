Once again, this baby seems to be up at night kicking away. Looks like we've got another Caden who will be up all night in the beginning. I really feel the baby when I lie down right before bed. The kicks are getting stronger everyday. So much so that I think Chris will be able to feel the baby soon. The funny thing is that the baby likes to kick when I am feeding Caden. He must feel the warmth or something. Or, they have already started fighting...Next appointment is Aug. 16th. Getting antsy to hear the sex!!! My back seems to be doing better as long as I take a warm bath and Tylenol every night.  Caden has the appetite of a bear. He eats 3 Stage 2 Gerber Jars each day and I've upped his bottle to 5 or 6 oz. along with the meal. I might need to give more when he takes just the bottle alone. He is really enjoying Peek-a-Boo and laughing. Courtney stayed with us for a few days and once she tripped as she walked by us. Caden cracked up. He's such a happy boy! He still goes EVERYWHERE in his walker. I've had to plug all outlets with safety plugs and remove several things from our cedar chest and what-not. He now gets on all fours and rocks back and forth several times. He'll be crawling in a few weeks. I think I will need to give him his first haircut soon...it's growing like crazy! I'll have to enlist daddy's help in that department.  Chris is doing well in his new job. He seems to be enjoying it. He still works nights, but we have learned to really enjoy the days together by swimming and spending time with Caden. Chris will  be 28 soon! Don't forget!!!  Well, talk to you soon! Love, us!
