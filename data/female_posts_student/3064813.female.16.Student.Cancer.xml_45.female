I find great amusement in their quite hilarious refusals.  Yeeeeaaahhhhh well anyways.  What's been up in MY LITTLE WORLD lately?  Nothing much, actually.  We just finished TAKS testing (finally) and I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL TOMORROW!  How hard does that rock?  I'm really, REALLY excited about that.  Brittney came into town last night with her brother and parents, and so I had to be really quiet this morning because she was sleeping on the couch. Heeheehee, it's gonna be fun because I plan on attempting another revolt against the pop culture that has implanted itself in her mind.  My past endeavors have been for naught, but I shall not fear!  My attempts will not be in vain!  Except, you know... when she chooses Twista over Muse or something. *sigh* Oh well.  I've become a music snob and feel upset about this, but I suppose one can't help but feel that the music that one is obsessed with is automatically superior to all other kinds.  I suppose I shall just have to accept the fact that PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT and it kind of amuses me anyways. Seriously, Britt and I should be a WB sitcom or something.  It's like... prep meets... not prep.  It cracks me up when she's not driving me crazy.  Ahahaha, we used to get into the BIGGEST god awful fights.  Wooohoo!  Party on, man. It's gonna be a blast having her visit.  We're going to go to the beach which is the object of scorn among my fellow Texans on Saturday.  Aaahhhh it'll be fun anyways. GOOGLE HAS AN EMAIL SERVICE?  How fucked up is that?  Pretty damn weird if you ask me....  Gotta jet, now!
