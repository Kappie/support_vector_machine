But once Church starts -all is good! :D Once again, I felt sick in the service,  AND  i had this massive coughing fit, and I had 2 run out of the room, and tears were streaming down mi cheeks from all the coughing. It was horrible. I like couldn't breathe. But the service was totally good, apart from it being  FREEZING!!  Kirsten's sermon really related to me, I thought it was  great , well structured, precise, and it got through to me. So s'all good. And the worship team and songs, lead by Luke, might I say nice job!! And wenu sung, totally cool! Like Mel said - "you sounded like a pro!" U've got a lot of talent there :D But y may I ask did Hannah W and Jess not come 2 church? I can understand y Hannah W didn't but Jess..... hmmmm  So neway, I had A   LOT   of good bonding time with my guy friends 2nite. Which was all good. Monty got too close 4 my comfort (and Luke's too  ;)  ) a few times, but all in good humor, ay? Haha. So yeh, totally bonded with a lot o people 2nite, so I was really pleased with that. I'm still really looking forward 2 the party! I'm enjoying asking what everyone is gonna wear!! SO after Church, we went 2  Maccas  which was also fun! I scabbed my lift in with Tom, in his  chick-magnet van , and Jo, Gemma and Monty came along as well. Jo was talking all about how she felt sorry 4 the Maccas staff because we always came there and they knew we were from the Church and we were so rude and made such a mess and everything. Hehe, and Jo and Tom were both sayin how I was talkin bout how I know who Monty likes in mi blog, and how I jsut ramble on and don't even know wat I'm saying. Becuase I couldn't remember saying that! but it's soo true! I do ramble!! hehe, I'm doing it now! *mwhahaha* There were a group of  drunk guys  in Maccas. They made me laugh. I like watching drunk people. They amuse me greatly. :D I'm a strange one. It was Luke and I's 1 week anniversary as Monty so kindly reminded me. I think he just wanted 2 point out that Luke 4got, which he actually didn't, but yeh, meh! In Macca's I had some  good squishy conversation  with friends. We were talking bout practical jokes. Monty said how u buy two drinks of coke. Finish one of them, then cut the bottom of it, put it on the tray, and pour all the coke from the otha one into it, and then move away. When the Maccas staff come 2 clean it up, they pick up the coke cup and coke spills and bursts out  EVERYWHERE!  Hehe. How evil. And Gemma and I were reminiscing on Mr. Channels, Johnny and his biscut, and "personal space". That was fun. And then I moved and had some good  un-squishy conversation  with other friends! Aren't friends great?! I luv mi friends! Scabbed another lift home with Matt Stanton. Gosh Mel can b a funny one. We danced around outside singing  "Heaven...I'm in Heaven!"  to get  warm!    And then I had mi late dinner when I got home. And, this is good because I LOVE 2 be oragnised, I have finally organised wat I'm doing tomorrow! I had like 3 different people wanting 2 do 3 different things with me tomorrow. But I have now managed to do 2 of them, and compromise with the other! How good is that!      Life is great....  School on Tuesday. But life is great. At least I can see my Rosie friends!! I haven't seen 'em 4 soooo long!! 3 weeks!! Luv ya'll! Blogging off, Aslave 2 the blog, Beth
