I miss my bed, I miss mom’s cooking, and most of all I miss Alyssia. That cute smile of hers and the way she talks to me and how she kisses me good night.   I was sent here in the first place because my office was the first to learn the new program “TRIP”. Therefore, I have to train the entire policies typist here on the new system and I’ve got to say that some people are just DUMB ASSES. I may seem like the type of person who have a lot of patience but I don’t. Damn every time I have to train someone new I felt like a bomb that’s so ready to blow.    I don’t understand why people won’t take notes. If ya take notes you’ll pick up alil faster. And maybe ya wouldn’t have to ask me questions every fucken minute. Didn’t any of these people learn anything in school? I’ve got seven people, all ages here that I have to train and they are in their early twenty’s, and mid thirty’s. WTF??? I have a few favorites but the rest are just SLOW.  It cant be my fault if they still don’t understand, I did what I could to train these people. I’ve got to say that the supervisor in this department is horrorable!!! She is an offal supervisor who is so unorganized. She doesn’t know what the fuck she’s doing. Many things that I know, she did not know. Whats up with that??? I have to make a complaint.  Well, I’m outta here that’s the best that I can do I put out all the effort and the courtesy that I had, if anything goes wrong after that, its isn’t my fault. I’m outta here. I get to go home now YEAH BABY….
