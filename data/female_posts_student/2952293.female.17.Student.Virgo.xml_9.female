I know it didn't feel like your birthday, and there were a few mishaps after school, but I hope you had a great day and I know you have a great year to come! Well it has been brought to my attention what has happened to one of my friends concerning her blog. I know she doesn't want everybody to talk about it, but you know who you are, I have your back! NOBODY MESSES WITH MY FRIENDS AND GETS AWAY WITH IT. That said, *****ATTENTION***** CHAIR NAZI: you know who you are. You work in the library, and you HATE ME. You have tried to make my life a living nightmare since I was in your advisory in seventh grade. P.S. why have I had you THREE TIMES AS AN ADVISOR? I was mad every time. I don't like you. Nobody at school likes you. I hope you read this. There is nothing wrong with what we say here, we do this on our own time in our own homes. Stop pulling kids out of the library by their ears. Stop harrassing my friends. Nobody likes you. p.s. stop dressing like MC Hammer. Nobody likes you. I don't like you. I hope you read this. You hurt my friend. Nobody likes you. Bye.  Anyways, that made my blood boil, and I do not like the chair nazi (credited to Liz Dawg). Today was not very funny. Nobody said "indianistically" to me. I thought I told you to all say it. Dr. Doden kept saying gross stuff in class. He had to, but it was gross, like "turtle sex" why Toni Morrison? Why would you make my male teacher say that? Why did Beloved have sex with Paul D, why? AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHY DID BELOVED TRY TO BREAST FEED WHEN SHE'S IN A TWENTY YEAR OLDS BODY. it was gross. But the book is good, read it. Mrs. Potts was mean to me again. Every time she says my name, I start to hyperventilate and I get sweaty and nervous. My brain goes completely blank and I just can't think. Ann tries to help me, but it's no good. Mrs. Potts doesn't like me. Ask Ann and ask Anna. Mr. O'Grady was funny today. He said, "Now a 17 year old young male wants the fun of being a young man. But when he fathers a child, does he want the responsiblility of being a young man? No, he runs away and joins the Navy." I was the only one laughing, but well that's my life anyways.  The he said, "Mr. O'Grady will lose weight, when he has a heart attack." OHH MR. O those damn seductively good doughnuts! I actually like that class, I'm about the only one. In Chem, Doc goes, "Did I ever tell you that story about the man who wanted to kill his wife, so he put her body in a bat of sulfuric acid and then threw it in a pit of gravel?" NO! Actually, it was interesting. Scotland Yard knew that she had a gall stone, and found it amongst the gravel! Then with organic chemicals, they found all her fat, and it matched her weight. Then the hung the guy.  Senora told us all today that she would be mad if we failed our National Spanish Exam, "Don't you fail, or I will ecome to your ahome and I will akill you!" WHAT?!?!?! AHH! She was kidding and didn't mean it, but it was really funny.  In lab, we were talking about my evil father, and he was like "Well you know most mixes (being that I'm biracial) are weird looking, but you're alright." THANKS DOC!  That was pretty much it. My feet smell and I am enjoying a Wild Cherry Pepsi. My mom and I went to Target, and that was my present. I'm not used to regular soda, SO I GET A LITTLE CRAZY. Spring break is just so near that I just can't do homework. But I must try.... Bye! P.S. Nobody likes a chair nazi
