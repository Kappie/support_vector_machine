Mind you, Scott has been being a dick to me and now he's hooked up with a good friend of mine so he's totally cut off. He doesnt know it yet and he must think he's the best lay I've had in a while but sometimes when ya wanna get your rocks off, you wanna get your rocks off. There's this little double standard that says that guys can be players and women cant. It's really shitty that Scott thinks he has the right to keep me from talkin to anybody else. My ex-roommate did the same thing so I guess it's a guy thing. Well anyway, a new guy came into the bar and I am just starin 'cause I think baby is fly - when here comes Scott, walkin into my line of sight over and over all of a sudden. Then he pokes me so hard in one of my ribs I thought he mighta broke it- and gets all in my face "you gonna go with me to get my tongue pierced?" Like I dont know what's goin on. You're not that smart, dummy. I've come to the conclusion that it's just something about me that turns guys off. If I was a white girl, I'd have no problem getting a guy- it wouldnt matter if I was fat, ugly, whatever. They just seem to like white girls a little more than they like black girls. In the meantime, I'm heavily debating going to see that ex-fuckbuddy person and I'm just... not sure if I should. I dont like feeling like I'm one of the ho's ya know? I know I'm not, but when all you get out of somebody that's supposed to be your friend first is sex, it kinda puts a damper on the relationship. Most days I dont even wanna be bothered with men at all. I think I am so rare of a person, guys are scared to death of me. Everything would be allright if I was just white. Since I'm such an underachiever when it comes to guys, I'm making myself an overachiever at everything else- even my drinking has improved. That's sad. Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just not as important, and I know that's not true. But I cant help the way I feel. I feel like a failure most days because all my friends have kids and families and I cant have any of that. Maybe one day I'll find somebody to settle down with, but guys tend to lean towards the fertle girls, and I"m not one of those. Some days I feel like I"m sinking further and further into depression because of it, but you know me... I'm not going to let it get to me. That promise I made to not "do something stupid" will be a promise I"ll always keep. I feel like I'm going crazy when I think like that, but I know I'm not. I am just so sick and tired of being passed over... bout the time the guy realizes that i"m the one he should have been with, I'm not interested anymore. I've actually been interested in the same person for over a year, but I know as soon as he realizes where he should be, I wont be interested anymore... that's just the way it goes. We'll drift further apart than we already are and one day we wont be friends anymore... that's the way it goes. Laters. -Me
