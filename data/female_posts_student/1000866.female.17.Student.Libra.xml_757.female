Amit's leaving tomorrow and MC, Stephen AND Kels are leaving this weekend. I  will be stuck without the clan for a week.       BUMMER!!!      But, that's ok. It's not like I don't have other friends I've been spending time with. Matthew will be gone too. :( so many people will be gone. It's terrible. But, oh well.    Tonight, e just went to the MGPPL (Meadow Glen's Park Parking Lot.)  We're exciting kids, aren't we? But, after that, we went to Colonial to get some ice cream. Fun times. And, tomorrow night, I must do something with them since they're all going out of town.     Sunday, Carson invited me to go see the drum corps show with the Cavies!!! I'm so excited! YaY Cavies! So, I'll get to hang with Carson and see the Cavies.  SWEET.
