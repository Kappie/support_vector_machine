You'd think I could just finish it and be done with it, but everything has to go back into it's place, and I always seem to find something to distract me for 15 minutes. The time just keeps adding up and before I know it, it's after 7:00. Ah well, at least I have my blog. I do wonder why I've become so dependant upon this though. I think I'd be rather upset if someone were to take away my computer, and not because I can't use AIM, but because I couldn't write in here. I suppose I could start an ACTUAL diary but that just doesn't seem right at all.
