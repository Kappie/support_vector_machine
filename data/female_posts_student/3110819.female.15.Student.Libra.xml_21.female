I would love to have someone take me away, away from school, stress, everything, and just stay a kid (well, teen anyway) forever.  there are so many major decisions I have to make. what college? what major? where do I get the money?  I just don't want to make them. is that so wrong?  I just want to fly away. away to a place where these decisions don't have to be made, and I can just relax and party all the time. I know what you're thinking, but I know I'm not alone in thinking this.  but I can't. not ever
