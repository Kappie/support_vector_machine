I went to a party in Shaolin (Staten Island, What what!) with  urlLink Missy ,  urlLink Anna   Ashley, for  urlLink Jeff's  friend's birthday.  It was fun mostly cause there was this yummy red drink that snuck up on you, there was some decent eye candy and because  we  were the girls that all the guys wanted to talk to and all the girls could only just talk about.  We were the hot, bitchy girls who no one knew (and normally who I hate) and it never felt better.  I love my girlies.  I can't wait to do it again in Boston!
