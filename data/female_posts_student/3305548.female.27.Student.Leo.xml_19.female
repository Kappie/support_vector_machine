I licked my thumb and tried to rub the "spot" off of his nose. He was less than pleased. After a few attempted removals I realized this was no marker dot, but rather a natural kitty freckle. Luckily Henry forgave me for my marker mix up, and for the ritual nose cleaning. He is four years old, and quite the little lion. This picture barely does him justice. He weighs 9.5 lbs and it is ALL FUR. urlLink
