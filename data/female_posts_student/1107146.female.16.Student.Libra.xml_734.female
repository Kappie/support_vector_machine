And cds, of course (Guster, Beatles, Counting Crows) and DVDs (all 5 seasons of Friends, Bruce Almighty, Finding Nemo, Ever After, couple of Beatles ones, etc.) and clothes.  Lots of clothes.  And PENGUINS!!! 6 to be exact.  2 stuffed (Hugsy and Fat Penguin) and then 3 figurine things, and then a penguin-shaped loofa thingy.  Kinda weird, but cute in it's own little weird way.  Oh, and Abby told me to tell you that I got penguin boxers.  They're from Aeropostale.  I got smalls, and they're huge.  I was like, wow,  small guy=big girl.  So what do the little puny guys do for boxers?  Cause there were definitely no extra-smalls.  Poor really-small guys.  And um, that's about it...   As if that wasn't enough.  Oh, yeah, a robe.  As if you care.
