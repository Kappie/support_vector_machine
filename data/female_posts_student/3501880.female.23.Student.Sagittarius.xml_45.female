Watching:   Still nothing--Working frantically on Case Comment! (Due tomorrow at five...eke!)    Mood:   Productive, as the sooner I get this case comment done, the sooner I get to read the latest issue of Mental Floss that arrived in the mail today! (Oh, how the gods tease me...)   I have just recently switched therapists, as you all are probably aware that my old therapist no longer works there. Not entirely sure how I feel about this new guy. I just don't think he gets it. My last therapist never tried to push those stupid pamphelets with titles like, "Procrastination and You!" or "Feeling Anxious about Anxiety?"...They are stupid, and just contains information that I have heard a millions times before but never seems to work. New Therapist spent 10 minutes photocopying all this shit that he asked me to take home, read over, and decided which works best for me. He said, "I am throwing A LOT of new information out you, so just sort of skim and pick and choose a few ideas to try for our next meeting."  Well, here is the one suggestion that I choose, or also known as "The Sixth Commandment of Time Management":  "USE TELEPHONE PROPERLY: Prepare for each call. List call points you want to cover. Keep brief and to the point"  THANK FUCKING GOD! The key to unlocking MY LIFELONG PROBLEM of procrastination! Apparently, I can't get anything done because I am not planning out my phone calls! I must prepare a script of what I am going to say before every call. My question is what happens when people call me? Should I ask them to hold or if I can call them back, and quickly prepare a script of our telephone conversation? Why doesn't the Sixth Commandment of Time Management address this issue?
