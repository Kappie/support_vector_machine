Keeping my feelings bottle up inside of me was far worse.   I felt so relieve to just let my anger and resentment toward him go. How trivial it seems now. I have learned a big lesson. It is always more painful to hide from the truth than it is to submit to it. Now I feel much better. A burden that was not mine to carry has been lifted from my back, and I am free.  Not much going on other than that. Yesterday I decided to get out and do something. Saying home was stifling. I went out to see a a movie with my friend Jessi. The Princess Diaries 2. It was alright. A little to sappy for me. (The Ring was one of my favourites for example!) I had fun anyway.  After the movie (Which Jessi's brother followed us to... the stocker!) The three of us headed to Wendy's to have a late dinner. Very good, other than the fact that the chairs where sticky, the food was soggy, and the fries kepted beeping.   "For God's sake! Take the fries out already!" Jess Kyle  Well, that'll be all... no fries with that...  BAI!
