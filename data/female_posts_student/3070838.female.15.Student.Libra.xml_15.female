OK, my sister and her friend were trying to be all politically correct for some homework where they have to design their own law. So Elise goes, "Why don't we make a law banning gay people?" And Allie and Elise are both like, "No, that wouldn't make people happy." LOL! That's so hilarious if you think about it seriously. Anyway, Ah yes, one of my friends just said to me:  X: and just always remember that even if no one else in the world wanted be ur friend i would. PHILEDA: wow is this like a warning? X: i hope not PHILEDA: am i about to commit some heinous crime of society and be convicted a criminal and no one but you will believe that i didn't mean to do it? X: i hope not PHILEDA: i hope so too  OK, there's a certain person that's a really really good friend of mine. It's a fairly recent thing, like this school year. And he's really very smart, he just doesn't care. He doesn't bother to try. Or he doesn't realise he should try. And just so you know, this "he" doesn't apply to just one person. This applies to many people, but I'm refering to them as "he". I just know that this person could be striving to his full potential if he could see beyond the end of his nose. And this probably won't make a shit of difference to whoever reads this, but I feel like I have to put this out in the open. Why? Because I luv u all.   OMG! Speaking of freaky horoscopes, "X".   Libra :  Your two sides really stand out today, and people close to you pick up on the yin-yang thing. It's an excellent time to go out of your way to collect new experiences.  Dude think about the conversation we just had? Look at that horoscope. That freaks me out.  OK, Anyone wanna hear something insanely pathetic but true? I'm gonna stay up until 11:11 tonight to see if something special happens because I forwarded something. NOT! lol.   Well, Luv U All Till The Rain Falls Down Cuz I'm Coming Clean Luv U Ricky :), Phileda-the-way-you-love-me
