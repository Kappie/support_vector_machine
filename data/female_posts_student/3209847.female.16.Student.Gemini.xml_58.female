I really hope everyone is having a great summer! Mine has been really good so far. Kind of unsatisfying a little bit. It should pick up though. Maybe  Umm.. Let's see..Friday night we got to see Ashley sing at Johnnie High's. She did so incredibly well! I am just amazed at how beautiful her voice is. It can definitely make me melt. I wish I could be half as talented as she is! =) Congratulations Ashley! You did such a great job! you just rock! The revue was interesting. I can for sure say that i am not a country person now. The root beer was good! hahaha.  Saturday, Ashley, me, and Katy had to go to Cedar Hill to practice for the European music tour. The music really isn't that hard and it shouldn't take me long to memorize in fact. After I got home from Cedar Hill, Sarah picked me up and we headed for Plano! We stopped at a McDonald's to have salads. They're pretty good. We saw Violet at the courtyard theatre. It was sooooo good. Mr. Newberry played Monty, or Montgomery, haha. He did SUCH a good job! god DAMN he's a good actor! I was so worried we weren't going to be able to see him afterwards, but we did and he showed us backstage and introduced us to a few people. We felt like superstars. It was definitely the coolest thing! I was sooo glad we went. We're going to again this weekend. Hooray!  Sunday I went over to Sarah's house and watched But I'm A Cheerleader and If These Walls Could Talk 2. They were both really really good. It was so much fun to hang out and watch movies with Sarah.  Monday, work was pretty good =). One class that I assist in totally just stopped doing work and basically refused to work. It was sooo odd. They all began to say that they were tired and didn't want to work. Now granted they are 1st and 2nd graders, but they've never done that before. That night I basically sat around and watched VH1. That's always fun, isn't it?  Today, work was really fun. I enjoy the tuesday and thursday classes. Afterwards, I went to Lachlan's going away party hosted by Morgan. It was a LOT of fun! I am so glad that Morgan invited me! I really am going to miss Lachlan. He has touched a lot of people while he has been here. I'm going to miss seeing him laugh. I also saw Harry Potter tonight. I just got back from it. It was pretty good. I hadn't read the book in a while, so I thought it was fulfilling. Sarah, however, remembered more details from the book than I did and thought the movie unsatisfying. It was good nonetheless.  I'm getting a little tired. I need to go to bed soon. First I have to take a shower. Good night everyone. Oh tomorrow's my birthday, haha. *Kiss* to Sarah. Bye
