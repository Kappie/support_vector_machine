Through the whole movie she TALKED really loud, started stupid conversations with people and kept walking around the room. She can't sit still for one hour, even someone with ADHD is more behaved during a movie. I can barely concentrate in class with her around. Sometimes she randomly gets up and dances to stupid songs on the radio, she flirts with boys during class time (although she already has a boyfriend), passes notes with her "friend" (well she was my friend...but now she ditched me for Laura) and says really nasty things about my new friends.  She is so horrible. She makes everyone feel like crap about themselves. I really hope she gets  kicked out of course. I heard she has 2 warnings already (once you get three you get kicked out for good). Actually, I hope alot of people in my class get kicked out. Yesterday only four people in class weren't stoned (including me), oh and the teacher wasn't stoned. The other five, were all stoned (not a very big class).  I wish my teacher would notice already! These stupid stoners are nothing but a distraction and they aren't following the rules! Marijuana is ILLEGAL and it's against the course laws. If you come to course under the influence of drugs/alcohol, you get instant dissmissal.  So why haven't these juvenile obnoxious posers been extradited!!??
