If you are reading this and you have seen Donnie Darko, and have any idea at all what the movie is about or what exactly happened or whatever. If you watched it and weren't confused the entire time, please can you leave me a comment because I'm stupid...and confused... Or if you have seen it and are confused to...leave me a comment so I'll know I'm not alone and we can be confused together...
