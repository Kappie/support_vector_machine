I actually got to learn a new dance -- and when you know the steps you ca go all out.        see, I think Israeli dancing is a good analogy for life. There are a series of steps that everyone does in their own style.  and the circle of people gets bigger as the night progresses and everyone looks different while thye dance but together they form a gorgeous fluid pattern.  And the music is lovley, and the dance steps creat a language.  I can read what step come next by watching the slightest body movements!      I had a great day today.  why?   because the OSP people are back!! yay!! I think I'l not stay home on my own for any more weekends its too depressing.        We had ulpan in a bombshelter today.  Not for any saftey reason, just because we moved buildings and we happened to have gotten the bombshelter room.  you sneeze in there and it sounds like an explosion.  Class was great, we played 20 question sin hebrew.  Our teacher Yaffa is wikkid!  The daily ritual has become to gather in the cafeteria after lunch and do our homework together.  This works out very well for us cuz we get alot done that way.  AFter wards I went to the vegetable sook.  Arabs seems to be drawn to me for some reason because Ashmail, a veg vendor, gave me his phone number and told me to call him when he gets to Canada.  Sure, Ashmail, sure.  AFter we went to the grocery store and they wouldn't take my credit car so now I have no cash.  Very annoying.  Alona, Ben and I are going to head to Bee rock tonight I think for drinks and bugles!!
