Crap-munkies, that creepy ass Robin guy is coing to Guelph tomorrow....I mean today, and yes, I have made friends with the dust bunnies under my computer desk because that is where I'll be hiding for the whole day. Well in reality I'm going to the Humane Society tomorr...today...and maybe JUST MAYBE my dad will buy me a damn web cam at some point this weekend. I can't glare at myself but if I could I would for breaking the old web cam.  My fat hairy beached whale cat is staring at me right now and it's creeping me out.  What else should I write? Maybe I'll tell you about the dream I had. I was being chased by some psycho killer that cuts people's faces off and wears them as masks......that is all.  OH YEA! I forgot about Joel. I thought I should mention him in here since I was a meanie and tripped him earlier, yea I'm angelic......I also kicked him in the shin....ahem.  I should try and get some sleep. Maybe I'll have less creepy nightmares.  Good night. Good early morning. Whichever.
