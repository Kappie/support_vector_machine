That's our plan. Jon thinks he can fight it. But he can't. We already control him and he doesn't even realize it.  I love the plan. It is perfect. And could be set into action at any time. Like maybe now.....or now....or NOW! Mwahahahahaha just be prepared! lol  Well right now I'm talking to Carol and Jon and Molly and listening to Allister.  Song: Take these promises I've made And hold them strong Don't think twice about those things that I did wrong   Cause I'd never do something intentionally just hurt you And I've stared at the sky and I've asked myself why you've become like an angel to me   Still the days and the weeks and the hours go by and the minutes they just fade away And I'm missing you every second in time And it hurts cause you're so far away All tears that I cry when you're not by my side And those nights I dream of kissing you goodnight Are on my mind -Don't Think Twice- Allister
