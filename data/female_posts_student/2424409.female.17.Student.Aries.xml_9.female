And he's the one that left, he walked out, my mom didn't kick him out, he thought it would be for the best if he left...so he cannot turn around and say my mom kicked him out, because she didn't. But of course he lives in his own little reality so as far as he's concerned she kicked him out....and he has been telling everyone that...saying my mom wanted him gone, and booted his ass out the door...he's so full of shit...GOD he makes me so mad.....     I wanna see a bunch of people up there and see if i can get some shorts, but i have no real reason t stay other then to watch my brother and sister and make sure "dad" doesn't brainwash them into wanting to live with him...so i go.    Well i guess i'd better go, im in a spare block right now, and have a few things to finish. write more later, bye 4 now     Your             Lil' Nicky
