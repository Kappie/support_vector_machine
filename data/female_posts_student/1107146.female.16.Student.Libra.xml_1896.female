Rosie gave me the assignments I asked for (thank you by the way, saved me a lot of time) and then we started talking about Abby's thumb (hope it's feeling better, btw).    So what happened?  I'm going to fix this real quick.  Abby, Rosie apologizes for whatever she did that upset you (You were mad? You've got to tell me these things when I talk to you!) (And Rosie, it wouldn't hurt you to actually apologize.  I'll respond to the stuff on the other blog there, cause I've definitely got some things to say there.)  Rosie, Abby accepts your apology.  Josh, we're not supposed to call friends "ass"  Use something more discreet like "butt" or "donkey" whichever you meant it to be.  Or call her something in Finnish.  She'll never know.
