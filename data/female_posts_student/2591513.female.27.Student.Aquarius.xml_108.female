I know that they said that it would take a couple of weeks...but geez...lol  I was hoping I did so well that I would get hired on the spot...oh well, huh?  So life goes on.  I am sitting here trying to remain calm and not be moody...although sometime that is hard for me because I am bored.  LOL  Summer, I should be in school.  I took this summer off to be back to 100% for the Fall.  I want to finish school already.  i am glad though that Leila is well on her way of getting done.  I am glad Kata is well on her way to finish as well.  We will all get there pretty close together...how funny.
