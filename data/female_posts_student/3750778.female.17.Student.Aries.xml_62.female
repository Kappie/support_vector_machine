This is the best entry I've seen ~~~~   Things I am looking forward to, Matt:  *in order* urlLink Fullsail , turning 21 and getting completly drunk for the first time, getting laid, taking over the planet, etc. etc.  Things I live for: My family, my friends, coffee, coffee-flavored ice cream,  reading  urlLink bill's  weblog, argueing with idiots,  like you , on the internet,  etc. etc.  So don't say I've got nothing to live for, I have  plenty  of things/people to live for.  So go outside and hump a goat or whatever it is you do in your spare time...
