It's not exactly like she gives you a great impression when you first meet her.  Her face is usually caked in so much make up that her face looks orange, and she always smells like cigarette smoke when she walks past you.  Well, today Felisha was obviously p.m.sing, and told me so... like I needed that cleared up.  It's not like this is really a big huge deal, but when I'm cutting almost eighty pounds of fudge and you're complaining for the three hours that you're around me about how much you hate this job.  Then I just want to scream!  I realize people pms, but why is it that some girls make you take the brunt of it?  Especially when they realize how they're acting. One of these days, I'm just gonna go buy some Midol at WalMart and hand them a  FEW  of them.  Maybe six, then they can pass out and I don't have to hear them.
