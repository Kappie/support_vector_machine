It's right over top of my house for once, and I have a 360 degree view of it. Turn in any direction, wait a tad, and there's the lightning, and the defening thunder to go with it. It's awful. I can't remember a thunderstorm like this.  Literally, if it was later, and darker, that's it. I'd be runnin to go hide with someone, I'd be a blubbery mess. I can't stand them at night. Kinda like a phobia. *whimpers*
