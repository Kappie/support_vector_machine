It was so frustrating!! everyone else knows my inside jokes with myself! *sob* I feel so...so violated!!!  on a different subject, I'm feeling really horrible. Which I guess is a good thing since I'm going to to end up lying and saying I threw up and passed out and went to the emergency room, etc etc as an excuse as to why I didn't show up at the movie I was supposed to go to with Merry and Aaron today. The truth is...Merry couldn't go and I refused to go without her, aka by myself. To those people who told me to just go alone, shut up. I need a buffer, ok, I couldn't go by myself, I was already feeling sick just about the idea of going WITH MERRY. And now I feel really guilty but I can't feel TOO guilty because I understand why I did it. I know people are gonna be really fed up with me....oh well. I'm afraid to answer the phone now, I'm avoiding windows, jumping at any sound....I hate this.  I doubt I'll be updating this real often, because I have a livejournal that I really like, and then I also have a xanga, which I don't like so much...and now this, too. oh well, I like blogger, maybe I'll get around to it.  hmm, now that I've seen so many commercials with Michael Phelps in them during the Olympics, I'm starting to agree with Grace. He IS hot. If only I didn't always have to see him in speedos. *shudder* Women's trampoline is on tomorrow, I'm so excited!! Trampoline rocks.  wow, it's amazing how much I'm rambling. Possibly it's because I'm home alone and hiding, which includes sitting her in the basement with the curtains closed, not on AIM, not on MSN, avoiding windows, not answering the phone. hey!! I've just realized, it's the return of Recluse Lydia!! Recluse Lydia is a paranoid delusional freak, who has no social life and at any sign of getting one reverts back to standing people up and hiding in her basement. Recluse Lydia is a jerk and Recluse Lydia is feeling guilty and very ashamed of Recluse Lydia at the moment. Recluse Lydia wishes she could call Lisa but seeing as it's a thursday afternoon and Lisa DOES have a social life/boyfriend and Recluse Lydia does not especially want to pay the phone bill resulting from the talk she needs to have with Lisa, it is not exactly likely that Recluse Lydia will get to talk to Lisa any sooner than saturday, whcih is two days away, which mean Recluse Lydia has about 2 days of feeling horrible and not being able to vent on anyone, and will be forced to rant on her online journals, subjecting any of you poor people who are unfortunately reading this to huge paragraphs told by Recluse Lydia in the third person, further proof of her insanity and need to be put into one of those way cool padded rooms. *gasp*  wow, I'm rambling way too much....think I'm going to....leave now....not that I know what else I could do...but yeah. If you read all of this, maybe you should go see a psychiatrist...haha.
