It started I was on a huge boat in the middle of an ocean with my mom and like 11 daycare kids. All the daycare kids were like doing this course where they climbed things, crawled on things, and slide down things to nursery music. Then like my mom was wearing a scary red dress. Then after all the daycare kids were done we went down below the deck to uhh.... change into different outfits. Well my mom brought out this patriotic dress and then a really REALLY big american flag. Well I thought it was for twirling like in color guard, but then she took it off the poll and rapped it around my head like a bandana. So I'm like ooook... Then like I went up with five kids and like these pirates started to board our ship. They grabbed the five kids for slaves then wanted more. I tried to fight them but they soon got five more. With these they took out these needles (sowing) and pocked each kid and each one died. One little boy was left. I took him to the front of the boat and told him to stay, but he followed me anyway. I got mad at him but then the pirates took out other needles (doctor) and stabbed him. Then I woke up. Isn't that nice? Well, yeah sure, I mean. The kids are gone now right???
