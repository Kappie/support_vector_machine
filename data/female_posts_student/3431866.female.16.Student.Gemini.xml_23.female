This person has lived through so much crap-sure, her parents broke up when she couldn't remember, but her Daddy gave her every thing he could and more. She has her job, friends who love her and she was almost popular in high school, but she managed to live all through that with her broken heart, and those god-damn pretty scars. She will prevail. She will not fall. She will not die by her own hands, or feet, or Salesmen. She'll realise what her destiny when she dies.
