Finally able to take a break for today, however, starting from tomorrow, another busy day and week ahead... Projects piling up again, and more assignments... Never ending... Who say poly slack, worst than ever...  Reflecting about the whole week, wednesday, went for this thai band concert at the esplanade... The deepest inpression this week... The horn tone, totally blown the whole audience... It was really amazing... Hearing that will feel goosebumps... Can't imagine if Shuqun have such godness playing, WOW... The trombone, was also heart-melting... Being a trombonist, can't imagine how the players can get to run with pedal notes... Double WOW... The tone was also heart-melting... The whole concert was totally enjoyable... Really over-whelming... Hope to work hard and become one of them...  Anyway, that person irritate me again... Find being with him really irritates me... Really want to shoot him at the face... Yet, don't dare to do it... Hai...  Not like me anymore... Don't know how to handle him... Just take him... Will be the best for both of us... Train patients... Ha...ha...  Well, went back shuqun today... Teaching was fun... Well, improvements in the sec 1... Really felt great, especially the Yi Heng, a fast learner, with his hardwork, will become the next Diana... Hope to train him to become better... The Jerryl also not bad, just lazy... Well, work hards guys... The next year SYF will be a great... The achievement feeling will be overwhelming... Strive harder guys..  Well, next week will be another exciting week, next sat again... Byebye... Ha...ha... ;-)
