Mood:  Not very good. ____________________________________  I don't get sick very often. Sure, I get my trifling sniffles, my pesky coughs, my general miserableness that I usually label sickness. But otherwise, I am a pretty healthy person. However, I fear that I have angered the Gods of Inconvenient Sickness.  These Gods are normally docile and friendly folk, but they have a sick, twisted sense of humor. They absolutely get-off on seeing those who are busy, stressed, and pulling their hair out to fall under the curse of getting ill.   Some might say there are reasonable, medical explanations for such phenomenon. Experiencing prolonged stress and anxiety keeps the body in a state of readiness, which causes the immune system to not function at its best, and thus making the body more susceptible to disease and infection. Rubbish...  These Gods are close friends with the Gods who like to get really drunk and pee on mortals (i.e., rainstorms). They belong to the same fraternity, actually, which explains their warped sense of humor.   One of the ways I have angered them is my long history of getting out of obligations by lying about not feeling well. In high school, I would forge notes from my mother about doctor's appointments and how I could not attend school because I was sick. In college, I would not attend the majority of the semester, and then plead to the professor about all my health problems so I could make up the work and get a passing grade. In my various jobs, I would feign a stomachache just so I could spend the day at the bookstore, browsing and reading.  Now, when I need to be at my peak performance during finals as well as juggling a job and life's little errands, the Gods thought it would be real funny to throw a viral infection my way.   Oh, Gods, my lesson has been learned...
