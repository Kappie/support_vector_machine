Maybe I should be on Zoloft like my dad. Severe depression is probably hereditary. Blah...  I actually had a pretty good day yesterday. It was my mum's b-day so we went for a really lovely dinner. Also, I finally got a new camera for my photography class. All I had was the typical point-and-shoot set-up so I got an SLR type. I set out with a $300 budget because that was all I have in cash. (Give me a break, I'm in high school.) Anyway, I found a nice Nikon N55 for on sale for $230. After at least an hour in the camera shop I had racked up an extra $120 in supplies I didn't think I'd need. Camera sales people can be tricky... My mum had to pay off the extra $80 bucks I didn't have but she didn't seem to mind.   This morning I managed to lose my cell phone in my own coat... Amazing, I know. I may be going more insane then usual...  My optometrist doesn't seem to trust me, tomorrow I have two hours of "contact lens training school". Now, I know this takes a bit of time to figure out but OVER TWO HOURS? Jeeze, what fun.
