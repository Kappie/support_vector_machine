Flake, Jack Johnson  I know she said it's all right you can make it up next time I know she knows it's not right There ain't no use in lying Maybe she thinks I know something Maybe maybe she thinks it's fine Maybe she knows something I don't I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying  It seems to me that maybe It pretty much always means no So don't tell me you might just let it go And often times we're lazy It seems to stand in my way Cause no one no not no one Likes to be let down  I know she loves the sunrise No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes And I know that when she said she's gonna try Well it might not work because of other ties and I know she usually has some other ties And I wouldn't wanna break 'em, nah, I wouldn't wanna break 'em Maybe she'll help me to untie this but Until then well, I'm gonna have to lie to her  It seems to me that maybe It pretty much always means no So don't tell me you might just let it go And often times we're lazy It seems to stand in my way Cause no one no not no one Likes to be let down It seems to me that maybe It pretty much always means no So don't tell me you might just let it go
