I just think the prices are outrageous. stupid prices. anyway. the mini skirts, the sheer tank tops, the colors! i don't wear colors. i wear white, black, red, and blue...dark blue. and now, I'm starting to like stuff of "the norm" is that bad? shit, my music is still the same......WHY AM I SO CAUGHT UP ON THIS! i think it's because i LOVE individuality. i don't do the pyrimids and TONS of bracelets anymore...really the last time i was "Original Heimark" to quote Chris Bakke, was at the talent show. I dunno, whatever.   6gb
