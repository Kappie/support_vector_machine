MONDAY: It was a great start for a new week..Late in the afternnon all 1st year students had our PE..We had a lot of fun..kaya lang may physical test kami as in racing..talo ako pero at least may grade diba..but the worst part i had a hard time breathing after that..pero ruth took care of me kaya naging ok din ako..  TUESDAY: Computer class namin today kaya for sure masaya nanaman..We had our discussion it was all good..Orur filipino teacher gave us a very interesting activity for the next day which was gift giving..  WEDNESDAY: Exciting..Today is the day para ibigay mga gift namin for each other kaya lang nag-cry ako kasi i was very touched for my friend's effort and yung mga inakala ko na di magbibigay ng letter they gave me one kahit simple note lang..It was a great day for me..I saw ate alex in school with ABU of course her only love..haha..bka patayin ako ni ate alex..HHHHEEEELLLLLLPPPPPP!!!  THURSDAY: It is our BEC today and our group facilitated it..I sang how did you know in class, it was our opening song..muntik na ako umiyak for a certain reason mga friendships ko alam yun..many things has changed since the gift giving..some was good but other experiences of mine were traumatic..hehe..in short it was really sad for me and even though the truth hurts, i still have to accept it..huhu..cry..   FRIDAY: i have already recovered for what happened for the past few days.today is the last day of the school days this week..im pretty excited for the weekend..I had a little chat with my friends..pero sayang i wasn,t able to see carissa and louise joy..pero this week was great..even though may part na maskit talaga..
