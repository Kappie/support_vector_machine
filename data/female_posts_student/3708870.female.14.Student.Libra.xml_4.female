Is it my fault that the citicens of America can not find a good place to... place their belongings on the side of the road.  And surly they do not have to extend to bloody far out into my shoulder!  I have gotten hurt way too much this very summer.  I do not intend to have another part of my body surgically removed.  Ok, so my knee wasn't surgically removed, but. Um. Nevermind.    So, the whole friggen male population seems to think I want too much in life.  I'm not sure about what.  But I thought that I can make it clear to the males out the what I um, "want".  Hmm... Starting from well, now.    1.  I want,  need , to graduate school.   1- 1/2.  Get car. A really really really nice car.   2. I need to graduate from design school.   2- 1/2. Go to Europe with signiffagant other.    3. Move to a city.  Perferrably a big one.   4. Live in the city (with boyfriend/husband or whatever the connection) in a flat. (Perferrably one on the top floor)    4- 1/2.  Possibly and hopefully marry one whom I love and adore, and HOPEFULLY!!!!! ditto for him too.   5. Move to outskirts of city when have kids.( A girl? Named Julia Mae ...whatever?)   6. Not be a soccer mom.   7. Overall be sucessfull and die before I need someone to change my depends.
