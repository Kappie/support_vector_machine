Diane brought ice cream from TCBY and we had pizza and we stayed up really late and....yeah, it was just fun. :)  I can't really say much more heh....I guess I could but it wouldn't make sense to anyone.  20, 8, 14, 10, 20, 6, 12! Haha. Wow, what a fun night.  Oh, I also got to see Earth Girls Are Easy! That's a really funny movie. Anyway, I must be off now.
