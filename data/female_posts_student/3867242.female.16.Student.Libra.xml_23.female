I'm willing to share another poem with y'all even though it sucks. I wrote about this poem about what kind of things I feel whenever I'm in love or in a relationship with someone. Right now..I'm  not  in love..just crushing a little..haha..but I'll neeevvverr tell! (Don't Say A Word..is an awesome movie! Go Brittany Murphy!) So yeah..here it is.  Whenever I Think About You  Whenever I feel the breeze of fresh summer air, I can feel your brace lock around me. Whenever I hear a love song, I think about how I want to dance with you. Whenever I watch the rain, I cry because I think about your pain. Whenever I hear a child's laugh, I laugh because you too are a child at heart. Whenever I wake up,  I think about how it's going to be a beauitful day because you are a part of my life. Whenever I pick a flower, I think about how rare and beauiful you are. Whenever I am sad, I wish you were there to hold me and tell me everything is going to be alright. Whenever you say you love me, it sends chills down my spine because you picked me out of everyone else in the world. Whenever I see these things, I love you more than before.
