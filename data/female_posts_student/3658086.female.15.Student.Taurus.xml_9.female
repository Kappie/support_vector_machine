So yeh I joke about her and say she is fat and ginger etc, but now i've actually got to go and talk to her. its so awkard being in a room with someone that you dont even know for a whole hour.. i cant stand it, I dont need counselling.. fucking hell... there is nothing i can do to get out of it, without either really upsetting mrs marshall or getting expelled.. shit shit shit shit shit. i'm gonna go mad..... shit. i need to talk to someone... I FUCKING HATE LIFE. seriously... i'm bloody scared...
