Someday I will get a job that compensates me reasonably well and doesn't atrophy my brain.  Not right away, mind you, but I will not allow myself to become a vacuous anorexic who sponges shamelessly and mercilessly off of my father.  I will be a better person and a better (read: more financially independent) daughter.  Probably just not this year.
