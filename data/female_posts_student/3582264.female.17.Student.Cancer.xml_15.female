How are ya!" and he asked me if i would still like to help and i said that i had a pretty busy schedule so it looked like i couldn't.  However, right after i hung up the phone i was like "man! i really do want to do it!" so i searched everywhere for mo's number and frantically called him back leaving him a message someting like " I really can't make up my mind, and i'd like to help, so PLEASE call me back asap."  So he did, and i'm working as a costume change helper :P  Its really rediculous, cuz i don't do anything, but whatever, it gives me something to do.  Another interesting thing about this is there's this guy that works over on stage left with me, and he's an interesting fellow.  I could tell right away that he was all "hey, how you doin!"  and so I decided to stay away from him.  However, he had to go to stage right to do a scene change, and he came up to me, and said something along the lines of "I've gotta go to the other side of the stage" paused for a moment, then gave me a hug.  "....ooookay!" I thought.  "this guy is a little odd" anywho.... oh and later he asked me if i would "do" the male lead in the play.  I've decided i don't like him.  Okay, now to how it becomes the play from hell..... The second night of the performances, i got to the theater and was setting up stuff, getting ready for the show to start, and us crew people were just standing around about 10 min. before the show was suppose to start, when the fire alarms went off, which meant we had to go around and evacuate the building; cast, audiance, crew... then two firetrucks show up, checked it out, and told us it was just  hairspray that had gotten on the lightbulbs and made the fire alarms go off (which we warned the cast about, by the way...) Then, once the show finally started, one of the cast members flew off stage in a hurry and knocked over one of the set peices,which landed on one of the legs, which landed on the syke (a very expensive screen). Translation: not good.  So, i had to rush to the other side of the stage and try to help this ONE other girl move this huge wooden bench that whieghed a ton.  But that's not all... no, no.  After the intermission, we were just about to start act II when, one of the cast members starts to hyperventalate, and almost fainted, so we rushed her off stage, and were trying to get her to breathe and calm down, and we couldn't, so we had to call the medics, and for the remainder of the show, she was in the back room w/ an oxygen tank and 3 medics around her untill her parents could get there to pick her up.  WOW, was that a show or what?!  On a much better note, Brett and I hung out today.  I'm never letting him pick the movie again.  We saw colladeral, and there was way too much "GUNSHOT! SPLAT!" for me.  :P  It was R for a reason i guess.... all throughout the movie i was curled up in my seat all grossed out and Brett just kept on laughing at me, and saying "Ali, you're so cute!"  Which under other circumstances, it would've been just fine, but it wasn't.  anyway.... I think that's all for now... i'll post again later if i think of anything more, it's been a while since i've posted, hu?  -Ali
