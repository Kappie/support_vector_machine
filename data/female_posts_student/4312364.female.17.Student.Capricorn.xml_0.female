Well not much to report...I did succeed staying up until 1, Nate and Jennifer finally got on at about 11, and then Double A (Aaron Henley) finallllly answered my message. So I was chatting it up with them til about 12:30. Went to bed and woke myself up at about 7:30, came out to the living room and fell asleep in the chair. Haha, does that count for waking up early? Anyways...The last official day of the summer, tomorrow's back to school (ugh). I'm gonna try to write in this thing everyday, but I don't know how that will go (between work and school who has time? haha). But I  will  try to get on tomorrow night after school and work to let you know how the first day went! I'm gonna try to make this last day fun, Carli comin over at 2 and we're going shopping one last time...I have to get a new purse for school! haha...  Anyways, here's my schedule for 1st semester of school for anyone who cares... A1 A2-Chemistry (Mr. Weber) B1-Child Care (Mrs. Kaylor) B2-Study Hall (Mrs. Kaylor) C1-Personal Finance (Mrs. Stitzlein) C2-Art 3 (Mr. Meek) D1-Horticulture (Big K!!!) D2-Design of Outdoors (Mrs. Carnegie) don't ask.... So there ya have it, the exciting 1st semester, which is basically a bunch of filler classes, except Chemistry cuz I still need a 1/2 credit for science...  Well now I'm sad to say I must go, gotta clean my room and do other various exciting (HA) activities before I venture to Mansfield to spend what little money I have left...
