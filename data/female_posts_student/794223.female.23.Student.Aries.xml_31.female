The physical anthropology one on Monday was a disaster.  Plane crash with no survivors.  I have no idea what I made yet, but at this point I'm hoping that I simply passed.  There goes any hopes for getting an A in that class.  I just took my Latin American politics exam, but I don't want to jinks anything by evaluating whether or not I did well enough.  I don't know about anyone else, but every time I walk out of an exam feeling great and exclaiming, "Wow!  That went very well", it always turns out worse than I expected.  If I don't say anything, it's always better than I expected.  One thing I will say, though: I'm sure glad I did a little extra reading last night.  For the long essay part of the test (there are five "short" answers and one long essay) Dietz was pretty specific: choose 2 case studies, one in which democracy has worked well over the long term (at least 10 years), and another case where democracy has failed.  Explain why, ect. ect.  The kicker was that he had a side note: one case study has to be from the book but NOT discussed in class; the other case had to have been discussed in class, but not in the book.  Tricky.  I chose Costa Rica and Venezuela.  About half a dozen people came up to him during the exam a little flustered an confused.  That's right folks--you have to attend all lectures AND read the mountain of material.  Trick-y.  Vicente Fox is in town today.  I wasn't sure if he was actually going to make it or not--with heads of state you never know, really.  I'm thinking about heading over to the Union later to watch his speech on the big screen.  I wonder if he'll talk about NAFTA or FTAA.  I've gotta work on finishing up my thesis tomorrow.  Sólo me falta como diez páginas.  Oh!  I forgot to mention~ Halloween ruled.  Jessica's party was great--I was Fidel Castro, and she borrowed my costume to be Carmen Miranda.  It was much fun--good beer and an excellent Cuban cigar ;-) (I had to be authentic!)
