She bought the largest package, which had like 26 poses with several different outfits. My most favorite pose she did was when the camera lady had her sniffing the flowers with a serious look on her face. lol. I'm SO glad we didn't order that package. I just am getting the cap and gown and the drape. Even with less variety in my package, it was still weird. I felt like a Barbie contorting my neck and head in different positions. I'm just worried about my serious expression...that should be a fun one to get in the mail!    Anyhoo, more seriously, my mom and I went to Mary's Garden at SMT this evening to pray for JW. We were a little shocked and disappointed that we were the only ones there, when so many people know about the meetings. If you don't, here's the 411: Every evening 6-8pm @ Mary's Garden @ SMT. You can drift in anytime; it's pretty informal. My mom and I were there from 6-6:30pm.    Tomorrow, Bobby and I are going to the beach!  Hooray!  I'm looking forward to some fun in the sun :)
