He actually turned out to be amazingly sweet and kind.  And funny.  I finally found out his name is Andrew.  Monday he kept eyeing me and smiling and said "hello Megan" in a dashing voice and nervous eyebrows.  Tuesday--same story.  Wednesday, he leaves his duty post to talk to me for a half an hour.  Easy to talk to.  Easy to relate to.  And he's intelligent.  Great plus.  And so my heart flutters.  I was excited and scared at the same time.  Wow, my heart still works!  But then overshadowing that realization was Wow, last time my heart got trampled.  Do I even want to consider opening its doors again?  The struggle between the good and evil truths of my mind were gut wrenching.  I was moving on.  I felt I had my feet put back on the ground, but only to be swept away by another charming young prince.    Thursday was akward.  I was still thinking and feeling my way through this inner conflict.  Friday was aweful.  Somehow, my mind was set on this station:  If I just give him the cold shoulder, I can forget we got to know each other better and forget the feeling I felt when he smiled at me.   In other words, I denied our chemistry and connection.  I am left with the feeling of being emotionally parched.  I smothered my feelings and pretended they were invalid.  And for that, I am angry.  Angry at myself.  I always screw things up.
