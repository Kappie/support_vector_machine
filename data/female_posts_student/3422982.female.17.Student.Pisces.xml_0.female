This research paper is almost over and done with.  I'm glad, but I've reached the point where I don't care anymore.  I can't take it anymore.  I don't meet all the requirements and I couldn't give a rats ass.  He's gonna have to accept what I have.  I just want to get out of here.  I need a vacation.  June 25th... I get my braces off, finally!!  Oh then I might not be able to take my drive test because I'll be leaving for Chicago.  I already got tickets and there was no way in hell I was gonna set the date back even farther!  It's bad enough my summers been cut back by almost a week.  It's not fair I tell you.  My life is shit and I'm getting sick of it.  I just wanna sleep and never wake up. later dayz
