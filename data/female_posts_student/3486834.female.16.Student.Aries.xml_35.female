YAY! that is, by far, the coolest movie, EVER! i stayed awake really late last night, even tho i was tired. like until 4. then my mom woke me up at 10, cause i had to "pull it together". we went and hung out with my grandad, that's always cool. at about 5, i got to go to the galleria. HORRAY! i am being forced to go to bed.. later.. and it's only 11!
