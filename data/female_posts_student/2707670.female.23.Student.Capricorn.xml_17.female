I thought they would be upset that we were copying their idea but Apparently they want a war, and there just not going to get one because here in 409, we make love, not war . As for the nine out of ten earholes that choose apt245, you wouldn't have even had a season without your loyal fans and cheerleaders who stood in the snow and cold to be there for you, so as much as we love you, I just have to say, behind every good earhole there is a tiffjody.
