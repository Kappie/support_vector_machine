You know, sometimes I really just sit back and marvel the friendship that we have. One day we are laughing, talking, and enjoying everything for exactly what it is -- no more, no less. And the next, I can honestly say that I do not wish to converse with her ever again. But I know, no matter what happens between us, that if I ever need anything, she is the first person that I could go to because not only would she help me through whatever it was that I had trouble with, she would do it with a smile. I love you!   Never again shall I underestimate the power of prayer. I feel so good. So... new. Now hopefully my sickening optimism will begin to effect those around me.  I saw that someone left a comment in my blog yesterday afternoon, Professor Batty, and I am left pondering whether he was a passerby or an avid reader, left hanging on my every word. :-) Nonetheless, having a complete stranger tell me that I was awesome was indeed wonderful. People should engage in that sort of thing more often.
