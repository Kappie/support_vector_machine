It is 6 days long and costs about the same as a year of tuiton at school.  We offer scholarships, but only to minorities.  Sorry, I don't know why we sent this to you.  Well, at least you can save the $50 invitation.  Oh, you can tell colleges you were invited to this conference too.  Oh, you were already accepted to college?  Nevermind."  I would love to go to one of these conferences, especially the lastest one, the Presidential Leadership Conference.  Basically, I get to choose the Republican or Democatic Presidential thing in New York or Boston, respectively, and watch and even participate a little bit.  Sadly, I do not have this kind of cash.  If you know any billionaires looking to help a poor white kid, let me know.  Seriously, let me know.
