I want him to care for me and be my friend and pick me to love. But the truth of the matter is only the pile of speculations that I have gathered. I only know one fact and that is he has a girlfriend and that I am scum.  So I try and be brave and prove to him that I don't need him and that I don't want him. When the truth is that I am inexplicably drawn to the liar. I wish I knew how to turn this feeling off. People say time is what does it, other believe that distraction is the key. Well it has been 4 months and the feeling has not faded and I have tried distraction but it has only resulted in me feeling guilty for hurting my distraction.  So I am stuck. I feel like there is something bigger involved in this mess and I just wish that the situation would resolve itself or at least come to a head. Instead of leaving me hanging wishing, and trying not to give into the unseen power that I feel dragging me toward him when I am trying with every fiber of my body, mind, and heart to pull away.  So in short the position that I am in sucks!  In other news I got my wetsuit. And I love it! I can hardly wait for this Sunday when I am going to try it out. I can hardly believe that my first tri of the season is only two weekends ways. July 25. I am scared and nervous about it. I want to do better than last year, and I know that I am in better shape but for some odd reason I feel less prepared. It is also going to be hard because last year I went with the idiot and this year I'll be going all by myself! Which is okay...The memories of last year are going to haunt me though!   Screw him...He is such a jerk for doing this to me!
