My mum bought us some bin bags but the problem is, when we invite some friends over, we have to tell them to bring their own chairs...Not very nice is it?  Well, because we wanted to be more social (ha ha!), we thought we would invest in a sofa. We found the base of a single bed for free and we are now deciding on the matress to put on. We found a second hand one, quite confortable and cheap, and we also found some cushions to go with it.  Total price = around 95 AUS dollars. Not bad hey! You probably need to see a picture of the "Unit 37 new sofa" so you'll be able to judge by yourself!  We will soon be able to seat properly to watch "the Block"!  To be continued...
