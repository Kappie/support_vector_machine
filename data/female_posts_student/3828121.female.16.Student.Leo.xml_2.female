She claims he'll regret it when he's with "some girl he doesn't want to be with and he'll cry when he sees her with guy." and she deosn't know how he can "just throw away people."  no he won't, he'll be with me....and no one throws me away....HA! but i know she's just venting and it makes you feel better, but....i am not some girl, by God.  She claims that everything about him is fake, and he deos things only to look cool.  then why didn't you say something or stay with him if it was that bad?   "and he made me feel like i treated him horribly: and I didnt ...I didn;t : he needs attention constantly, he needs to be the center of attention.. either by being way too hyper, or way to depressed : and when people get in the way of what he wants to be and who he wants to be he ditches them: and here I am, ditched: and I do not have to feel like this: he called me fat before, he cheated on me.. and I felt like I treated him wrong.... what was i thinking?: my self esteem dropped so low when i was with him: he made me feel like i couldnt talk to my guy friends because i was giving them more attention than him and that was bad: I was jelous when i was with him, i was unhappy when I was with him."  i can see exactly where nathan would come off as needy....i really could....but....my stars....you didn't have to dote on him all the time. you didn't have to give him the attention. i know i sure as heck won't. if i want to go somewhere with david or one of my guy friends, i will. he can be upset. no one ever said she had to put up with it. and if you were so unhappy, why didn't you leave? i bail out or "ditch" people when i'm unhappy. but then again, i can see where she's coming from if she loved him. i wouldn't bail out on anthony for anything, and he made me feel like i was nothing. but she didn't have to but up with it.  see, if i were in this situation, knowing myself, i would prolly feel the same way. but since i'm not, and i like nathan, i'm just kidna like, suck it up, move on, there's other people out there. but she didn't have to be used as she said...just b/c you love somebody does not mean you have to let them use you. i learned that the hard way. and i've done my share of using. and neither scenerio is good. but i'm going to try and change his insecureness. i told him that we were going to be different from he and her's relationship. but if he's not secure enough on his own, then maybe he doesn't need a relationship....but like i said....changing all of that.....  but ya know, thinking about it, he says he stressed out partly b/c of her...why? i can see where she still calls him...but why does he even bother to read her journal? he knows it will only stress him. *anger* see, my reason is right here. i don't want to go out with him until this whole thing with her and him stops. i'm already all pissed off as it is.....and we're not even going out....
