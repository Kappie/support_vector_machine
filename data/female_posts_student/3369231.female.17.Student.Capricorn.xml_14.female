And I wasn't mad at you for your decision, even though it appeared that way whenever I walked back to my house from your car and closed the garage really quick and went into the house without looking back.  I was just about to ball my eyes out and I didn't want you to see me like that.  I understand your decision, I may not like it but I understand it.  I just really want to give things a second try.  You never know, I may be just what you need to help sort out your life.  And tonight, whenever you were talking to me... when I was laying there with my back turned.  It was because I was thinking about what you had just told me, it hurt, and I was trying to sort things out in my head and figure out the next thing that I was going to say to you while trying to not ball my eyes out.  Nick, I want you back so badly.  I don't think that you even realize.  I don't know if you know how much I care about you and how much I want to help you.  I know that things were shaky in the past, I know that you are scared, and I am too.  But, I want to take a chance.  I am willing to take a chance.  And I hope that you are willing to take one on me too. Tonight, I said something that I didn't mean that probably hurt you.  I said that "you know how strong my feelings are for you.  And you told me that you still have feeling for me... but I don't know if you actually do or not."  I am sorry for saying that.  It was out of line and I shouldn't have said it.  I know that you have feelings for me because I can tell that whenever I look into your eyes and when we talk. I know that this is a confusing time in your life... I just wish that there was some way that I could just take all of your confusion and pain away from you.  If there was I way, I would... I would take all of your pain and make it mine.  I would do anything for you in the past and that is still true today. I am taking a big chance by telling you all of this.  I do not know if you will be upset, angry, or what your feeling might be.  But I had to get some things off of my chest.  I want to tell you so many things in person, but my mind goes blank because of how much is running through it. Nick, you mean the world to me and so much more.  Please, let me explain myself to you later on today before you go to class at 10:00.  I will call you whenever I get up, cause I want to talk to you. I hope you have a goodnight's sleep, and have sweet dreams.  You deserve it.
