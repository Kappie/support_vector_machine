I have a secret, some people already know but I know a lot of people don't, some of the more important ones. I guess I haven't told those ones because I'm afraid of how they will react. *sigh* ok so yah here it goes. I know none of you will judge me. I am Bisexual.....  Yah I know surprising hey! The ones I've told seemed to see it coming, I guess they just pay a lot more attention to the things I say and do then others. Anyways yah that's all I really wanna say. So I guess ill leave it at that.
