This shameful act was an attack on a woman the attackers believed was Jewish.    This article caught my attention first because France is all for cultural assimilation, and therefore the government is not usually supportive of other cultures exisitng in France.  It is interesting that this woman was not actually Jewish, which could help government sensitivities toward her.  Also, the primary reason for the attack seems to be theft, since the attackers realized only after the attacked began that the woman could be Jewish.  The attackers showed signs of anti-Semitism, but only after the attack started.  The attackers motive was theft, and later they decided to add elements of a hate crime.  This really is not much of an Anti-Semitic attack, then, if the primary motive had nothing to do with anti-Semitism.  Yet the article headlined it in that way, and therefore was misleading.
