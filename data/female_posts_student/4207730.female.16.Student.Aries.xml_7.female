But I just got her new CD Autobiography and I LOVE it...she sounds a lot like COurtney Love. But the album is cool...shes pretty hip,lol. I don't really like her style, but I'm glad shes not just trying to be another blonde pop princess,lol. Shes got a unique look to her and a fresh face. Ashlee is like 110% better than Jessica. I mean I think Jessica's songs are ok, but I dont like her voice, *shrugs* she sounds like a man or I dunno just somehting about it. Ok, well I'm about ready to call Alyssa to see if she would like to go to Taco Bell with me. I will blog more later. '  Watch Big Brother tonight,lol.
