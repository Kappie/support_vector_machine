This all means that everything in the living room has been spilled and displaced in my efforts to move them away from the wall, and Mike has taken apart the kitchen drawers, spewing their innards all over the counters. My mother helpfully broke a tea pot while trying to remove plants from my painting area, so we are watching out for glass shards as well. On top of this, dying roaches litter every corner. Any hopes for peace and order are abandoned.  If that wasn't enough, we were, for a short time, the proud owners of a giant, squishy leather couch. This was bought for $50 from our moving neighbor, and took up residence in the middle of the living room, approximately 2 feet from the tv, where all we camped out until Mike's friend relieved us of it this morning. My hatred of leather couches is somewhat lessened after falling asleep in it's squashy goodness, cradled like a baby in a big brown cow pouch.
