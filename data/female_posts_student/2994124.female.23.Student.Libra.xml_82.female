Had good day today – maybe God does have ears to hear me after all.  Finished all the notes at work which pleased the staff, but made me sure I was now redundant which I was upset about because I’ve really enjoyed working there. But the GP came in and they have decided that since I work so fast they are going to get me to summarise and sort ALL of the medical notes in the practice! So I have a list of about 500 names that need doing – should keep me busy for a while!  So guys I’ll catch up when I’m back.  Take care of yourselves – oh and sort out a reunion date ok?  love mexxx
