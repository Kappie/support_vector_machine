Eileen's is under the classroom photo and Andrew's is under comments under his haiku.       When you want to a new posting, click on "Posting" and check new. Then it will post at the top of the blog. Otherwise, if you click on "comments" under the last posting, it will only show up if we click each posting's comments. (This function is good for us to comments on other people's postings -- say Andrew posts apoem, and wewant to commentspecifically on that poem.) New messages or messages to everyone should be a new posting, which goes to the top of the blog. Does that make sense?       Has anyone heard from the others? Do they know we've recreated our Spetses in cyberspace?       All the best,       Lisa
