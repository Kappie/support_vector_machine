Every day after World Literature we would walk to the college cafeteria and eat lunch together, sometimes studying for a test, but mostly we discussed his sexuality and his faith. I was curious about him, about how he could be both gay and Christian. I grew up in a Southern Baptist tradition that labeled homosexuals as deviants who were out to corrupt Godde-fearing people. Listening and learning about life through the eyes of scared adults, anything and everything can be painted as black or white, right or wrong, and good or evil. When you are a child, it is hard to see the that the world is comprised of multiple shades of grey. Therefore, it is easy, too easy, to judge others for their differences, because you are not yet comfortable in your own skin.  At a time when I was advocating at the top of my lungs against institutionalized Christianity, Michael was advocating in favor of the church. It baffled me that he did not consider it a paradox, a contradiction, or an oxy-moron to be a gay man and a Christian. I did not understand how he could support and participate in an institution that stated that Godde hated him for who he loved. Michael told me that he believed that Godde is merciful, kind, and loving, rather than a vindictive deity that is pissed at the world. "Sometimes the people in charge of the religion," he said, "get so wrapped up in the rules that they forget about the message. The message of Godde, of Christ, is ultimately about love for your fellow man." A few weeks later, Michael broke down another barrier of prejuidice that resided inside me. He told me that he was HIV positive. I remember that we had been sharing a basket of french fries and I was paralyzed with fear at the thought of contracting the disease. Now, I realize that it was a naive and foolish fear, but at that time it was a life-altering experience, because it showed me that who you sleep with is insignificant in the grand scheme of life.  I never saw Michael after that semester. I tried to track him down several times, but never succeeded and I have moments when I wonder if he is even still walking among us. I am convinced that he was an angel, a messenger sent to me by Godde to teach me about compassion, honesty, and love. In light of recent events that have taken place within my community of faith, I have thought about my friendship with Michael more and more and I often wonder what he would think of all this controversy surrounding a gay man that wants to bring people closer to Godde. To me it is clear that Godde places people in our lives to teach, inspire, and make us better human beings. Godde does not discriminate and I am very proud of the Episcopal church for recognizing that truth by ordaining Gene Robinson. I will stand by my church and my faith, regardless of the political ramifications that come from this decision. It is my firm belief that, eventually, we will all have to answer for our actions. To the individuals that are quick to suggest that Gene Robinson will be punished by Godde for his relationship with a man, may I remind you all that casting judgement is also considered to be a sin. Instead of pointing fingers, learn from this man. Open your hearts and embrace the message that is being sent to you.
