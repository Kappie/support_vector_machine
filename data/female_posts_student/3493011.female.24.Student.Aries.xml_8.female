I don't feel anything.. not angry, not sad, not disappointed, not gonna cry, not gonna say anything from now on...No more questions in regards to the future...No more...I'm gonna be a silent partner in this whole affair...  I finally get on the routine of keeping fit by swimming... but farnie thing is the more I exercise the more I eat hmmm... The uni's pool is kinda crowded on a Sunday..but I love the changing area: clean like a clubhouse... I'm tryin to start on my thesis but the weather has been so cold..I've been sleepin more and also becos of the late nites I suppose I tend to be more lethargic... For me, this hols is driving my energies all into my work, keeping myself busy, not thinking of anything else... I'm gonna spent more time getting to know God's word cos I kinda slack.. my memory fails me most of the time... I can't remember any verse but I get the gist here and there... really need God's help..  Focus of the month for me: God's will
