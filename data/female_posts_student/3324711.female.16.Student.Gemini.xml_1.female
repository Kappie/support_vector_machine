Well lets see whats the line up for today.. working, then to band practice with lauren :D possibly hopefully something with behn, and then go to bed early because I am dead tired. "and I look like shit without my makeup on... didnt I? you can say it, I looked like shit! Because I did.."  hahahha. I wont explain that one. Anyway so today will be the last day that I see behn for a week [and a day].. I know its not actually that long but we're really used to seeing each other, well, almost everyday. So itll be weird.. and Ill miss him, but its not that long right?.. right?   I wish Tyler was here to give me the old "when I was going out with [insert random girl name here], we only saw each other twice a month because she went to a different school than I did, its only a week and youd better not get all mopey because I will come and kick your ASS." talk. haha tyler I miss you, in a cousinly sort of way.  Well Behn if your reading this, if you ever get near to a computer when your gone, you can always come here to my blog and read about how much I miss you.. or Ill probably end up writing you sappy letters that start with "Dearest Behn..."  ...Ill try not to though. Man Im weird.
