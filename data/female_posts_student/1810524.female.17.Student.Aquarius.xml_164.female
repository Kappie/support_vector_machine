(lil kimmy thing bless her...we all have head guts in our heads, not brains!lol) but anyway...i like the topic...but it'll b tricky. you can do like fragmented dreams...so i might interlink all the scarey things that goes on im my mind with dreams....coz ppl knowing that theyre real would jst b wierd!  i was thinkin of mayb doing some to show lonelyness n stuff...but i dunno...coz it would b like impossible to get someone to pose and act like i feel..coz they woldnt understand coz they're not me! so if hav to photograph myself...which is iccky coz im horrible and unphotographic! ill break the camera! i have a few ideas...but i dunno..it'd b hard to do alone but imbarracin to do with ppl!altho maisie n kim i can tell anything to...i dont think they'd understand coz i couldnt imagine them ever feeling like this.... see how emo am i being?! n i actually am gonna go and sit in the dark and cry now!  i havnt spent enough time with pete lately...things feel as tho they've changed...only a bit...but it kinda worries me..coz that was the startin point of me n sams last break up...he got wierd n distant! its just like lil things thathave changed...meaningless to most ppl..but i notice! n i dont no what to do. coz with sam, he got distant..he wouldnt admit anything but i new something was up..i could just tell! so i thought that if i put in more effort then he might go back to normal..but instead he got worse...n worse.. i new there was someone else...i could see it in his eyes...not all the time, jus little hints every so often..and then when we broke up it hurt even more.... so i dont rly no what to do...coz if i dont put the extra effort, like i havnt been then nor does he! he doesnt seem to be makin so mch effort...but that might b coz im not...but then what if i put more in and try n get closee to him and the same thing happens?! do i just push ppl away?! or just put them off?! it must be something, coz things seem to always change in the same way... n its hurting already! n it doesnt help havin rly close friends of mind tellin me i sldnt b with him n always sayin things against him...it does hurt coz he is still my bf, n matter if others like it or not!
