I suppose that I will be going back in to work tomorrow, since I don't really have much else to do. No social outings or anything, and I spent all weekend purchasing clothing so that I don't go around looking like Raggedy Ann or Salvation Army Barbie anymore. NO MAS! no more of that. So now that I have no more money to fritter away, I don't really know what to do. Making some seems like a good idea.    Reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS also seems like a good idea. We will be discussing that upon our return to class in AUGUST!!! Stupid lowlife school district imbeciles. Wonderful book though. My favorite quotation so far is "where have you been you young monkey?" Great literature. Must also start art AP projects. need those to get in the class. yeah. should really do that.   oh well, i am going to read now. my eye is twitching.
