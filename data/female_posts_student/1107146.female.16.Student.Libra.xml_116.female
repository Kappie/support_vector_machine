Now, I've got a little beef with this song,  My Sacred Path , it uses the lyriks of parts of the songs  Glory of Sadness  and  If It Ends Tomorrow ...weird. And the inside art work is...just weird. But it's a good album. I listened to  Glory of Sadness  first off.  But then I spent the rest of the weekend listening to  Between Times , and it's AWESOME still. Ok, getting bored with it a little. But, I kan't bring  Khronos  with me anywhere, konsidering the rotting, krukified Jesus on the cover. Shit.  Getting  A Dead Poem  next. I WANT IT.   Elftown is funny.  G'bye.
