Heh.. and my stupid portfolio is officially a full month or more overdue..... -tosses out her future- crap i hate my life...... School at least keeps my mind occupied. Grrr.... I'm falling towards the brink of wanting Andrew to bother me just for an excuse to yell at someone. Well..... thats today.... and ugh... family tomorrow... as if I wasn't depressed as it was.......    - -I wish there was a fairytale that turned into my life, so I could kiss Prince Charming man and be his princess wife.- -    I still have to teach myself Trig... and Conics.... math sucks.. right up there with long weekends..... and just randomly.. I want to start growing some Oleander.... death in such beauty...... hah.. maybe I shouldn't have gone to see Romeo and Juliet.    - -I wish the voices in my head would leave my ears alone, so my eyes could stop their water bleeding and I could find a home.- -
