Andy with his harem of swiss girls.     Dave looking sultry.     Me and Colin (who taught us to juggle clubs) performing.     A duel of medieval proportion.     Colin with some fire poi.     Dave and the man Grum.     Colin juggling knives above me. (he did actually drop one, but fortunately it hit me with the flat of the blade)     A really cool bowl. There is a story behind this on... Oh wait, there isn't.     Me Dave and Penmo playing twister, which went on for an hour and a quarter(!!)     A cool windmill thing belonging to the Meon valley Rangers.   Most pics taken by me, cept for the ones that im in, obviously. I think they were taken by Andy or Dave.
