Ya, I know... GREAT VERBS!!!!  But I guess it doesn't really matter about him. I mean, we're friends and all but. He totallllly doesn't ever... like.....hmmm.  He is just a jerk, that's all. Like with our book for example... he told me that he doesn't want to finish it with me.  Well, screw him. Ah!
