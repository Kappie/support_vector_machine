I am so bummed because I thoroughly enjoyed my professors this semester an even though they were a challenge for me, I loved my classes.  I ADORE my English professor.  I think that any professor who is able to widen your horizon and broaden your understand and cultivate your thoughts is an AWESOME teacher. I want to be just like him.  I am truly sad that I won't have him next semester.  Although, I may just take one class at Palomar just to have him as a professor.  I loved his class.  Anyhow...nothing new, bad headache episodes and so they think I may have severe complex migraines and may need to give myself injections if they aren't remedied.  GREAT!  With my fear of needles too.  Oh well, let's hope the meds work for now.
