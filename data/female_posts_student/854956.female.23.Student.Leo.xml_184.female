Especially considering I've had so much to worry about and I've been so busy between school and work for the past 6 months!  I really needed the break, and I'm ever so thankful to the university Gods for granting us crazy college students a week off from all of this book-worm crap.  :-)  What's on my plate for tomorrow?  I dunno... possibly going to find a dress to wear for Easter, but I'm not sure yet.  And I really should get in some hangtime with Druck, because I don't see him enough... We'll see how that goes... maybe we'll do something tonight or tomorrow night.  What else is going on in my little world?  Well, I've decided not to pursue anything with Scuba Steve, because frankly, I don't have the time to devote to a relationship right now.  I'm doing good to spend time with my friends, and at this point in my life, they're more important to me.  I found that my crush turned out to be just that... a crush.  It was passing... OH WELL.  When my person comes along, I'll know it... and until then I'm having fun living!  :-)  I miss certain things about being in a relationship, but unless I find someone who's perfectly fine with only seeing me about 2 days a week, or they're willing to come to my house a LOT... well, then it wouldn't work out... because every night I come home pretty tired, and all I wanna do is just mellow out here.  What else?  Oh, my friend  urlLink Shannon has a blog  now.  I found it by seeing a link in his AIM profile.  Ya know, I miss that guy!  He is such a wonderful guy!!!  He could always bring a smile to my face, and he was a great conversationalist... we never had boring talks...  I hope that I can find more time to chat with him....
