At dinner today, I thought I had killed my mom.  There was this guy at the gym, and he grunts like he's screwing when he lifts weights.  My mom had just eaten a biscuit, and her eyes just popped way out, she starts turning purple, and it occurs to me after thirty seconds of this, OMG she's choking!!  WTF do I do?  I couldn't remember if you're supposed to do the heimlich below the ribs or at the abdomen.  But it's all good, she just straightened herself up.   So moving on, I just saw that hot chick movie for the first time, and let me tell u, it's hilarious (to borrow a line from Joel W.).  U kno that boy from Mrs. Doubtfire, the adorable little middle kid whose bday ends up bein the last straw between Sally Fields and Robin Williams' characters?  Whoa, he got HOT!!!!  WOW!  The movie itself is great, but the boy?  Again, to quote Monica from Friends (Courteney Cox Arquette)..."Huminah huminah huminah!"   Well my sister's looking over my shoulder, so I cant say too much.  Right now I'm relaying what my dad wants to say to my cousin, trying to keep it G-rated.  Thank God they're gone.  Now to the stuff I actually wanna talk about.  I learned an interesting quote from Shaheen, but since she procrastinated, I have to get it off her away message: ""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." [Albert Einstein]"  To translate that into my life, I should be nice to people, but not too nice cause then I'd just be fakey and too sweet.  Well I gotta cut this one short cause I gotta go in five minutes.  I'll add more later, some good stories so check it out in about three hours.  Later for now.
