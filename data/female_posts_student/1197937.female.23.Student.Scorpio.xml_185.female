(Surely, a decent man would appreciate a woman of modest appearance and humble breed.)  as soon as I pulled into his driveway and saw him coming towards my car, i realized that my awesome powers of deduction had failed me, big time.   i guess i could sum it up by saying that he's a mysterious-adonis-by-night-full-blown-pimp-daddy-by-day kinda guy.  at the club where we'd met, i distinctly remember him in a sleek leather jacket over a simple black top.  for our afternoon date, the man was decked OUT.  i don't even know where to begin...maybe with the tan suede jacket fringed by faux mongolian fur that he had to  special order  from an obscure boutique in nyc...or the finely tailored shirt with distinct couture print...or the turquoise Dior sunglasses...or maybe i should just jump right into the bling-bling around loverboy's neck  and  his fingers.  as you can imagine, i was abso-friggin-lutely mortified to be trapped in my cotton gap tee, tattered blue jeans, and imitation dr.scholl's sandals by way of target.  all i can recall from the drive towards the pier in his topless mustang is that i was feeling very very resentful.  there was no doubt in my mind that this man had breached the first-date code of fashion conduct by dressing as he did.  in fact, he specifically misled me to believe during our prior phone convo that he was a real chill and earthy kinda guy.  has the man no scruples??   on account of his good looks, I could have  easily  forgiven him for his smoking/drinking/drug habits, to say nothing of his faltering sense of direction, his dainty appetite that made me look like a starved elephant by comparison, his swollen ego, his frequent use of profanity and porn, and the fact that he had nothing in common with me.  but quite simply, the man had out-bling'd me on our very first date, and that fact alone is a travesty i find so reprehensible as to preclude the possibility of any future to be had between the two of us, period.  so in conclusion, the answer is an emphatic  YES!
