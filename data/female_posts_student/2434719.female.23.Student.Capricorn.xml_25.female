(this applies to all things and everything). i think that's why i like journalism, in theory. IN THEORY. ugh. did you know, that on cnn they said a large percentage of our age group turn to the daily show for thier news? no no no no no no. no. no you can't do that.  i'm not saying i'm a news god.  i never watch the news, although i want to.  i just forget we have a tv, i SWEAR that's the truth. :) i try to read, i try to know what's going on.  and don't get me wrong, i still "greet the heat"  hee hee when asked what he thought about kids watching him for news, jon stewart said:    "A lot of them are probably high," Stewart cracked. "I'm not sure, coming off of robots fighting and into our show, what we're dealing with out there."   check out the article at:  urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/02/apontv.stewarts.stature.ap/index.html    RELIGION AND POLITICS... A NO NO.  the u.s. is one of the most religious countries in the world. maybe the most, actually, studies say.  i sound like my mom, spouting off random stats and facts that nobody can find.... heh...but i learned that in class :) i think i definitely had a biased view of the passion, just becuase thier pr tactics were shady (in my opinion), and you know, they're out to make money.. of course i think most pr is shady. please don't beleive anything you hear.  please. i hate pr. that's why i think i'm going to start focusing my degree in advertising now. (some would say that's not much different, but trust me, at least i'll be trying to sell a product, rather than my soul.) the more i learn, the more i have to get out...  i forgot what i was talking about. oh yeah, the passion. i still don't want to see it.   it makes me sad becuase there is an unspoken divide between strongly religous people/friends and those who aren't....  we're walking on eggshells here.  doctor! doctor! newman, i'll let you know if i have skin cancer so you can grow it in your lab. NEWMAN IS GOING TO CURE CANCER! i know this.  and have big biceps.
