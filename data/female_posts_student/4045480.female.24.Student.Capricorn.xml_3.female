I found out the other day that I passed my third of three tests for teaching certification, yeah! So now I'm clear for takeoff:) The plan is to have fun, and to prep for student teaching in the next few weeks, maybe party it up a bit here and there, and then get into student teaching. I'm really excited and yet nervous at the same time. Hopefully it'll be as fun an experience as I think it will, and then it's on to hopefully a full time position with a good school system.   In a perfect world, maybe in about two years,I'd like to be out on my own, have a dog, travel, and just start really living life on my terms. For those of you that know me, you may recall that I had always toyed with the idea of moving to Florida to teach, ya know so I can work part time at my favorite place in the world, WDW of course (that's Walt Disney World for those who don't understand the lingo).Well that dream has definitely lost it's luster. I have to admit, I really am enjoying the city and the burbs much more now than ever, and I hope I can find a nice spot of my own in the mix sooner rather than later, but all in due time I guess. It's just amazing to me because I feel like it's finally happening, I'm finally in the process of growing up, or at least really making strides towards it. I don't think I'll ever fully grow up, who wants to do that, but I realize that I deserve to be selfish, picky, and shouldn't allow myself to ever settle for anything less than what I really want. I think from time to time my self esteem issues creep back up, and I start to settle because I think I have to. The fact is I DON'T HAVE TO, AND I'M NOT GOING TO AGAIN!!!That feels good, empowering really. In reality none of us should feel we have to settle for anything, we should push to get everything we've ever wanted, and not allow for anything less. Okay, okay, I'm coming down off my soapbox now.   I think I need to start making my list of travel destinations, maybe get one of those maps and put pins in it showing where I've been and where I want to go. Boy, I'm either a great dreamer with a large imagination,or I just am much more goal oriented and methodical than I give myself credit for. Eh, maybe it's both. Maybe I'll even post it one day, could be fun.   By the way, to all you readers, I know my thoughts can be random at times, but I'm trying to do this more like a stream of consciousness type thing at times, so my advice is just go with it.
