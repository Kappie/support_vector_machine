I have, however, found a quiet moment so I decided I'd write.  I've got nothing of real significance to say, as I've been in one of my "I ran out of paxil on Friday and its now days later and I'm sickies" funks, but I have my paxil and I'm feeling much better.    I am trying to get motivated to get my butt to the gym and actually USE the membership I'm paying for (my paxil-less funks leave me nauseous and winy in bed which makes it hard to do anything else)  Next week I will be starting a new eating plan (mostly Japanese cuisine like sushi and rice) and salads and water only.  Of course I will be able to have a few snackies here and there, but I'm really gonna try hard to lose weight with  urlLink Boz  and the others who are working on it.    I also want to say thank you to  urlLink Lou    urlLink Lisa  for the wonderful birthday  Disney pressies and to Lisa for cheering me up over a sushi dinner, it was wonderful and I absolutely adore you and your company! (c:  I wish I had something witty or entertaining to write, but its the middle of the week during my busy season at work...always a quiet time.  Take care my lovely bloggy neighbours.  I'll catch ya on the flipside!
