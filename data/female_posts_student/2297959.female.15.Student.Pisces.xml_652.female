VBS is over and done with. i cannot express my thankfulness for that. i can sleep in, stay up late, do what I want to during the day, be unfriendly, yell!, and just be absolutely weird. it is wonderful. except for the funeral tomorrow for the unknown great uncle, packing, and then leaving on sunday for missouri. ugh. i can't believe that i have to live in that RV for another week. like 16 days wasn't already enough, i get to run off to yet another hickville and spend quality time in a lake. with myself because i can't tolerate my brother and then my dad will be off with his buddy who lives where we are going and then my mom has her own things she wants to do like read books. so i decided i'm bringing my guitar and laptop. that should be sufficient entertainment for the weekend. and who knows, they might have some kind of internet connection. then you wouldn't even have to miss me.       i'm sad to see some of those kids go, like 2 out of 13. the rest, well, let's just say there were no tears shed. i have to find an all black outfit for tomorrow. i don't have many black skirts but i think i have pants. wearing all black is pretty boring if you ask me, i like neon colors and crazy tights and all kinds of colors of pants. now i'm up to red orange and gray. i need more though. any neon color would be nice. well i will just have to keep searching. i want to see napoleon dynamite badly but i don't have any way to see it because i would have to go to barrington, plus i have to pack/clean and i have no way there or back. let alone someone to go with.
