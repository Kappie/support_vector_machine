I cannot believe that I thought working at the Pharmacy would be less tiring than the airport. It would had the current manager actually behaved as a manager.  Here's the Cliff's Notes.  Someone isn't performing their duties. I talk to the manager about it in an attempt to clarify the situation and to see how I'm supposed to interact with this person. I was told not to interact with this person despite 24 hours before that I was asked to train this person as they had not been trained before. This despite the claim that this person has worked in apharmacy before. I was also berated for making the complaint and was told to leave it alone.  Needless to say I am furious and not at all happy. I have sent detailed e-mails to the owners after each and every shift detailing what goes on in the pharmacy. The owners are sympathetic to my concerns and apologise each and everytime that they are on the phone to me, whether it be at the pharmacy or at home.  One of the owners is coming up next week. YAY!  Other good news: I have a place to stay in Perth and it's not with family. EVEN DUCKING BETTER!!!!
