However on second thought, maybe a feeling of helplessness is needed more often.  I'm such a control person; I worry constantly, obsess over details, and I can't handle it when something goes astray.  I need to remember I'm not in control, life is to big for us to control it on our own.  Let go Lizzie, let go.   Let go.  That's what the lump is from.  I was sitting there in the rocking chair next to Mary Katherine as she typed away on the computer and suddenly out of no where...   It was October of 2002.  Me and Jamie, Lindsey, Kayli, Sam, her brother, and Chad are in the Corn Maze in Hartford and we're hopelessly lost in the darkness of the corn stalks.  "Do you KNOW how to read the map Lizzie?"  Ha, that tone in his voice has never changed, just become more sincere and less cynical.  Then we're in the parking lot.  We have two cars, one which arrived with 5 teenage girls and a middle school brother.. And then Chad, and his car.  For the drive back to Sioux falls we split up... Anyone could tell Jamie desperately wanted to ride with Chad, but never alone.  I found myself in the back seat of the Daytona.  We talked about his multiple detentions in middle school, Spanish, and of course his driving habits.  Ha, I remember when I was so afraid of him in elementary school.  Even up to freshmen year he intimidated me.  It's so strange to go back and look at the evolution of a friendship.  I was afraid of Chad.  Kayla and I pretty much met in the sand box.  Laura McCarty and I became friends in the 6th grade after being thrown together in reading class, in Jr. Philharmonic and at the lunch table.  Sam hated me when we first met, then one night at lifelight we just clicked...   Do you ever stop and think about it?  All you've been through, what you were like before them.  Not just what they mean now, but how they got there?  I have so much to say but no one to say it to.  I'm bursting at the seams to talk about what I believe, what I think, what I feel, why I'm sad, happy, optimistic, feeling helpless.  I've been trying to figure out the perfect person to say these things to.  But I'm just so scared I'll pick the wrong one yet again.
