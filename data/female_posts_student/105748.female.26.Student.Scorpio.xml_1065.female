If you use netscape communicator or outlook express as your default email client, I would suggest that you guys create filters to delete repeated subject headings to further slow down this dreaded disease that is floating all over the internet and in all email servers.    ie.  If you get a frequent subject headings like "RE: Hi", "RE: Mailer Daemon", or the ever popular "Re: Hello"  Just a little P.S.A. ordered just to make your email and internet surfing a little more enjoyable instead of waiting due to lag time - most especially those who still use dial-up.  Cheers!
