I mean, I know what to do, eat an apple not a bag of candy, call people back instead of watching TV (that's how you make friends), go to class, do the homework. Why on earth can't I do these things when I know I will be happier in the end.   I think there might be a secret conspiracy going on in my subconscience to ruin me!!! It has to be 'cause I know better.   I will get to the bottom of this!!!
