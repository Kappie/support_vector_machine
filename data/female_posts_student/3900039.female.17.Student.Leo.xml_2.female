OH and i had to go get a tb test and i had an alergic reaction to it so i have this red thing on my arm! its gross....they thot i might actually have tuberculois! it was scary.  gabe  leaves for  australia  tomorrow :( we had a good long  talk  last night. he seriously is so freakin'  perfect  it scares the crap out of me. i hate it. we've figured the next time we are going to see eachother wont be until  october ....thats so long... i think for my  birthday , which is in less than a month(august 16), i'm going to go out to  dinner  with all my really  good friends (carol, justine, christina, court, jenna, collin, and ryan). if anyone has suggestions of good places to eat, make them now, cause i dont care. then afterwards have even more people over to make  homemade coldstone (jenna can be the example haha) and just hang out and swim or whatever. i still don't know what I want, any suggestions? we have to have my  party  early tho, im thinking the 12th cause i have it off of work.  im done.
