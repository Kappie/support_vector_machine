And the second goal when Basinas was given a penalty kick in the 51st minute. Everyone was waiting for Figo from Portugal to do something about the 2-0 situation they were in and he finally rose to the occasion late into the second half of the game when he took a corner kick. Ronaldo made use of this golden opportunity to do a beautiful header and scored the final goal. Although Greece bagged the majority of the penalties with 24 fouls, the game ended 2-1 in their favour.   Spain VS Russia   Russia totally paled in comparison to Spain. They were just freely dribbling the ball around without any specific aim. Sharonov of Russia was also the first player to get the red card. He wasn't even allowed to sit on the bench and was immediately sent off the playing area, after two yellow cards in a row. Radimov got sent off next for use of foul language. Spain on the other hand has obviously been put through the mill and displayed their co-ordination and excellent tactics when taking the indirect free kick. With a swift false move they carefully avoided the human wall and got the ball past the Russian players. Unfortunately, they missed. The highlight of the game was when Valeron of Spain stepped onto the field in the second half. Within mere seconds of his entrance, his first go at the ball scored Spain their first goal and Valeron's fourth international goal. Spain began playing rough too when David Albelda (yellow card) rammed himself head-on into a Russian player in an attempt to get the ball. Russia continued dribbling aimlessly until the game ended 1-0 to Spain's advantage. And the fouls committed: 21-12 to Russia's advantage. (or is it disadvantage?)   England VS France   7 hours to THE game. I wonder how the punters are reacting to this particular match. France (Defending Champion) definitely has the upper hand here with players (many of whom are from Arsenal) like Star Strikers Henry and Trezeguet , Zidane, Pires, Viera as midfielders and Barthez on the defense line. England has excellent teamwork but I'd like to see them get their balls past Barthez. He is the most flamboyant goalkeeper I've seen with elaborate actions while trying to block the shots. Agility is his strength. Although England has Beckham on midfield, Owen on forward, and Campbell on defense, I still think their chances of winning are slimmer. It'd be interesting to see how England reacts towards such a strong opponent. Many fans will be rooting for them tonight. But they'd be of more help praying for the team. With enough luck and effort, they can pull it off with a draw. It'd be a pleasant surprise for many if England wins. But hey, miracles do happen. My prediction: 2-1. France wins. I'll be utterly disappointed if they lose. This had better be an exciting game if I have to stay up into the wee hours of the morning waiting for it.
