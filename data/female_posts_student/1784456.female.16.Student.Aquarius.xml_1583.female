I am more of a communist than George Bush's IQ score. (Which could make me very conservative.) Empathy for all! I hate the whole right's view of 'bugger everyone else I'm getting out of here' it's closer to anarchy than my blue socks. (Yup, it's a random day) Doesn't everyone just love my words of advice? (Don't you mean commands of acceptance) Well... maybe... Ahh but I've decided that if the Conservative party becomes the next goverment or if the BNP get any seats I'm moving to Cuba. And I'm taking my cats with me! Actually... I think I might leave them in Britain and infect some pain on the people. MUHAHAHAAA! Nah... I couldn't live without them! I'm gonna kidnap them and hide in my flat when I go to London. Actually... I think my parents will willingly throw them at me when I go! They're so cute, but no thanks to the load of dead animals! Ahh, not that I can't handle dead things, but it's just kind of waste. I bet they're causing an extinction in rare birds near us or something like that. I LOOOOVE MY CATS!
