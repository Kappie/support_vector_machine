I love you oh so much! You're so greaat!   I've had some pretty awesome conversations lately. Especially on Wednesday night? Catching up with Cres was excellent! Forgot how lovely it was to talk to her =) I misss her! Uhmm oh caught up with Kris  Kevin..both never fail to amuse me! haha ahuh. And teddy  Lee! Oh you know I'll be praying for you both. And Ian! Came to pick I up at school even though I wasn't there! Aw no! Thanks for the thought though =)  Let's just say the future holds interesting things. A whole lot of it will change drastically - maybe for the better, or worse. Who knows? But I am excited all the same ;) Assessments are finished! Don't get me wrong, I am relieved..but these holidays aren't going to be my average holidays - only bout 100 days to go. I am very disappointed with my Trials Timetable though. It's horrible. But I cannot wait til my trip to Hunter Valley - golf oughta do it.  Everyone's leaving me! ALL are going to Melbourne! *friendless* That's okies. At least I will keep myself occupied with party party parties! Kat's 19th, Jess' 17th, Ness' 18th, Joe's 18th, Keira's 18th, Hazel's 18th - forgot who else. hehe party poop. I promise you Cres that promise I promised! Hahah.  -- I cry at night cause I can't hold you hahahaha --
