That was interesting. It went something like this:  BunHug: Oh! You scared me. (since he creeped up on me) ZooB: Sorry. So are you done with the observation? BunHug: Yup. ZooB: I was wondering if you were still alive... BunHug: (wondering if now is the best time to remind him he stopped emailing me...) Yup, Ive been around... *and then some other nonsense was spoken here* ZooB: I had to get up early yesterday to take somebody to the airport. BunHug: (wondering if i should ask if it was in fact his girlfriend) Oh yeah? ZooB: Ok, I need to go work on something or other...*as we both walk in separate directions*  Yay. My life is so interesting. It is encounters like these that make me say boys are stupid. And in the long run, saying it doesn't help any. It doesn't change things. So anyway. From this conversation and how I have been anxiously awaiting my reply from Neb.(I check my email at least 4 times a day), you can tell its shaping up to be a less than stellar week. Maybe I am too pushy. I like my pushiness though. Im the queen of pushiness. At least it helps you get your way. Oh and work is making me extra tired lately. Im not sure how much longer I can handle the opening at 5am thing. The most interesting thing thats happened so far this week is that I get to maybe help out with orientation. Talk about study abroad or something. Woo Hoo. Slow down, roller coaster of life.
