She told me in 1996 that someday, when we're all reclusive people whose primary identities are found on the internet, it will be really nice to have some space to myself, like my own webpage. Well Duck you were right!  It looks like I haven't written since Junior year of college... um, thats a while, so I'll try to fill in main events right now.  The end of junior year came and went really fast. Through Spring, Summer, and Fall 2002, I was primarily devoted to my research in the Pehek lab when I wasn't in class. I managed to get 3 studies out of that lab: the SPUR study on D1 receptor specificity that took me to the Society for Neuroscience Conference in November 2002 (almost IMMEDIATELY after I was declared out of the severe stage of mononucleosis--see below-- I was on a plane to Florida! let's just say, never go to CityWalk unless you remember your ID! The only places we were able to go in were MoTown, MargaritaVille, and someplace else I can't remember. Although, dancing with the students from Alaska and Birmingham in the middle of the street for 2 hours was totally fun! So was getting reimbursed for the trip later!!), and then the Risperidone study took both Omar AND me to Colorado Springs (Can anyone ever forget the superposh BROOOOOOADMOOR Hotel? OOHHH GOOOOOOOD. or running into the other two indian/arab students from vancouver that were there and goin out with them for nearly the whole night (on Omar's heavenly bed, wasnt it)? or meeting the guy that invented Clozapine in person? perhaps driving "into the hills" during every spare moment, and watching EVERY STAR IN THE SKY SHINING above us from the pitch black heights of the Rockies! and then freaking out because the pot dealers brought their pickup to teh same ledge we parked our rental Camry! And finally, did I drive 10,000 ft into the sky? Up the tallest mountain in the continental US? in a RENTAL CAR? AWWWWWWwwww YEEEEAAAA baby!), and finally, I got to work on a really fast project to try to look at prolactin regulation of dopamine (American Cancer Society summer grant... that was the time Dan came by and nearly puked when he saw the rat guillotine). And all that fun was just from working in the lab! Let this be a lesson to those of you who think research is boring and for, dare I say it, NERDS.   but I still managed to have a life ON campus too. I TA'd BIOL 210 and 211, for Missy, who was once my own TA back in the day! Teaching is SO in my genes. My grandfather was a teacher, my dad is a professor, my uncles are professors, my other grandfather was a spiritual advisor. Its in my blood to teach people. I knew that academia was totally for me because of my TAing... and of course, I also got to meet all the cute little froshes and sophs. Admittedly, I had my favorites, and its been so cool to watch them "grow up" and start doing research of their own, get their own fellowships, etc. I miss em!  I also continued to work, at least peripherally, with ICDG and MSA (probably not as well-organized as I was initially), and RA both Glaser and Kusch (top of the hill buildings). I wasnt very good at either of these huge projects during senior year for several reasons. First of all, I got mono at the end of September, JUST after I submitted my AMCAS. So, I sat in bed, thinking I was dying, waiting for my spleen to rupture as I tried to breathe, propped up on 4 pillows for 2 whole weeks so that my throat wouldnt close on itself (it was SO swollen!), and surviving solely on ginger ale and Caprisun liquid calories. I dont think theres a single episode of The Wedding Story, Trading Spaces, or The Baby Story that I ever missed. For someone who never watched TV, I watched more than I needed to make up for it during those 4 weeks in bed, and the following 2 weeks "adjusting to light activities." So, in the meantime, my secondaries piled up skyhigh, and I scrambled to finish my coursework so I could still graduate on time (did you know mono counts as a student disability?). I actually took the midterm and final for my Pharm 430 class within ONE week of eachother!!  Second reason I was underinvolved Senior year was cuz of med apps. I applied to several schools, from what I remember, they were OSU, CWRU, Wright State, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, U Illinois, Boston U, NYU, U Michigan, Duke, and Wash U if I remember correctly. Aside from the "only in-state applicant schools" like MIch, Boston, and NYU, I got interviews at every school. I actually ATTENDED interviews at OSU, CWRU, WSU, UIll, and Wash U. I know I know, why would I cancel an interview at Northwestern or Vandy? Believe me I got slapped across the face by many a compatriot premed for being such a snot. But honestly, it was because I knew I wasnt going to make it into their MD PhD programs (I missed the deadlines for that application at those schools) and I had already been accepted to MSP at UIll and OSU and waitlisted at CWRU. Wash U was really tempting until I actually went to St. Louis. I didnt like it. And yeah, I lived in Cleveland for 4 years.. St Louis should be a step up eh? Whatever... Ultimately, I picked OSU.  It was good for me for a lot of reasons. I knew that an 8 year investment of time would require a lot of family support, and also perhaps more of my own support of THEM. So I wanted to stick close. As Westernized as I think I am sometimes, whether thats actually true or not, I still have the ingrained belief that its my job to take care of my elders in their old age. Its the least I owe them for all I've put them through... I mean seriously, I would have a really tough time trying to raise a kid like me! I'm always so damn complicated! Also of course, I liked the OSU program better than UIllinois. Funding and resource wise, social life and urban access wise, OSU had the goods and U Ill didnt (as much). The third and final reason I was underinvolved on campus was cuz I spent so much of my spare time either in the lab (I'm talkin weekends and evenins here!) or with the former BF Dan (yes, former... we'll get to that). When we spent time together during the SUmmer of 2002 living in Clarke tower, we had a great time. I could totally be myself, immature goofball that I am a lot of times when I let loose. He taught me how to swing dance, and I gotta admit, when a man knows how to treat a lady as a lady, and dance with her as a lady... dude thats impressive. We did the whole moonlight stroll thing, sharing our personal poetry with eachother, discussing our views of the world, etc. Then I asked him out (I'm always making the damn first move... can someone ask ME this time around?) and the rest is history. Coping through my illness, his LSATS, both of our application processes and interviews, my cousins illness and death, and pre-graduation craziness... in some ways, the point of the relationship got lost for me amidst the fun. I mean, who doesnt like having ready company thats always comfortable, easy to understand, and available for hugs? I'm a sucker for a hugger. OK, that sounds so weird, but if you can stop laughin at the statement, you know what I mean.  ANYWAY, it was only when we spent several weeks apart during summer that I realized that our relationship was built on some flimsy idealisms, my own stubborness to make everything work no matter what, and the CWRU environment (which indeed is a bubble, and anyone who has ventured out of CWRU knows this... its not a bad bubble.. its a bubble you miss.. but its not a bubble you can take with you when you leave). We broke up in August just before classes started here at OSU. We're on hiatus but trying to be friends, but I think we'll manage.  SO yeah, in May I graduated. In June I started the MD PhD program here at OSU, also called the IMSP. I'm doing my PhD in integrated biomedical sciences, which essentially means I have access to rotate through and/or do dissertation work in any lab at OSU that studies something relevant to human disease. Its a different program than traditional MD PhD programs because it involves taking some grad classes and some med classes simultaneously at all times, but in the end, you get the dual degree and usually even shave a year off the time. For the CWRUers, its something like the BSTP and MSTP program all mixed together.  So far things are going well. Its definitely taking some adjustment, a new place, a new bunch of people, a bunch of people from my past that I suddenly run into (and had lost touch with.. so where do we pick up now?), and new responsibilities. I have never been a drinker, but suddenly I'm in this place where everyone drinks when they go out, so believe it or not, I'm finally learning to be a DD (i.e. I have been). I discussed this with Saad the other day. No matter how bad things got at CWRU, alcohol-wise... it was nothing compared to down here. AND, nobody ever really drove much (beyond across campus... a whole 2 miles), IF EVER. So this whole analysis of drinking and driving is totally new to me. Does that make me naive, innocent, or clueless? Anyway, its one of those new things, I'll learn, and I'm fine with it as far as my end is concerned. I'd never make someone stop drinking if thats what thy really want to do, just like I'd expect them to never push me TO do it, because I really dont want to (i have my reasons...). If theres anything CWRU taught me, its to be tolerant, and be yourself.  I do love bootyshakin on teh dance floor, and people watching, and meeting people, and of course sarcasm and "those random connections" (all the way back to Peter's connections journal) gets the best of me ALL the time, so I've still managed to have a good time between study sessions (and even sometimes AT study sessions!) I gotta admit its hard here. As a mud phud, I dont quite fit into the MD1 class, or the IBGP PhD class, because my course requirements and schedule always differ slightly. Its easy to feel disconnected from both. Then of course, I'm THE female rep in our 4-person mudphud class. I can't reeeally complain because its such a small program and I assume the fellowships are more smarts-related than gender-related. There are two other women mudphuds this year but I've only met one. Natosha is great though, just further ahead in her career and in her life. We connect as women and friends, but its different than chillin with my fellow 20-something ladies. I mean, I've actually always gotten along better with guys, and when I count my closest pals, I'd say a good 70% are guys. But still, amidst all of this disjointed social life and scrambled academic schedule, I need some sisterhood ya know? What happened to my always reliable always fun always social activist dance-lovin posse of Soumzy, Samara, Hadele, Maheen, Yasi and Ro? Cooking together and bellydancing and playing powderpuff sistas "Fooooball" trying on outfits and guy-bashing and analyzing Trading Spaces and planning community service projects? I'm still in touch with everyone from CWRU, thankfully, and of course, I'm making my best efforts socially down here. Never really been afraid to go up to someone and start a conversation. Even if you're only 30% successful at keeping in touch with the person, its a better chance of finding cool peopel than if you say nothing at all. So yeah, I've met a ton of people, and theres definitely people I could go up to and make small talk, or joke around, or study with, or invite out for the weekend, and a handful I could even "talk" to about the things that I really* think about. But overall, this early in the game, I think I agree with Nupe when he said, "its like you end up making these really good friends, people who are always ready to hang out with, people you have fun with, have tons of inside jokes and history with, but when it comes down to it... how many could you tell your life story to? or talk to about the bad things, the sad things, the things that worry you?" I guess overall what I've been feeling lately is something between the thrill and contentment of being independent combined with the boredom and frustration of being alone. Its the pain and excitement of the lone adventurer starting on a hopeful journey..... I guess its time to call it a night. As usual, my best writing/venting is at 3 AM. Still hopeful though, and working hard to be the best damn Mud Phud Chick there is.  "I wonder what wonder the world will bring me today?"
