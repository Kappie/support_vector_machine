I don't know if I have really grown attached to this place as much as I see this place as a lot of missed opportunities. I could elaborate on that, but I think that it would take a lot of effort to rehash my regrets. I'd rather not. Not to say the entire year living here was a complete and utter waste. It wasn't in the least. I learned a lot about me and what I'm capable of. But I don't think a lot of the elements of this city worked with me (on my side) to maximize the experience here. There are a lot of cases of "what could've been," sadly enough.   I am not feeling so incredibly great right now. I took a little catnap since I got up this morning at 5:30 am this morning (in a panic, of course), and I feel warm. I feel fat too. I need to work out, but I cannot thing of one physical activity that I want to do besides eat. I gotta do something, this is pathetic. Get out of this funk, you crazy woman you (note to self, sorry you had to be privy to that epiphany).
