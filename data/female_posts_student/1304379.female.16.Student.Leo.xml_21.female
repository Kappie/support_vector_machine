He enjoyed working around the vicinity as he claimed that the people here were friendly and amiable. Everyone around the neighborhood called him Fran or Fran Lee [abbreviation for Francis], as he felt that such a calling sounded closer to the heart. Initially, Fran was a diffident young man in his thirties who did not know the nitty-gritty of basic public relations, as becoming a bus driver was a whole new experience for Fran. He had never worked outside an office before he was retrenched during the Economic Crisis. Three years from then, he had grown to become a mature and confident young gentleman, who held himself in great poise. Everyone in the neighborhood held him in high regard. However, he still keeps the reserved pearly white grin. Thus, fooling the new kids on the block to think that they can climb over his head. However, the old residents like myself know better. Then, the unfortunate thing happened. An old lady filed a complaint against him as she claimed that he allegedly closed the bus doors on her, landing her in the hospital for orthopedic treatments. All the residents were taken aback by such alarming news. No one expected him to close the doors on a weak and helpless old lady. Tongues wagged. Fran Lee’s renowned reputation was ruined. It was heart wrenching for the residents to see someone whom had been held in such high regard fall into dire states. Fran Lee was terminated from all bus related services with immediate effect.  Then came the new bus driver. Everyone was excited to see who the new driver may be. His name was Mr. Tyron Hong, with the pseudonym, Tyrant Hong. From his name itself, we can already see his popularity in the neighborhood. He was a road hog who tail gates, obstruct other vehicles on the road, and “Hongs”, as his name suggest, as he pleases. Everyone in the neighborhood abhors his driving manners and character. Mr. Hong was a stuck up driver who hated children. He thinks that they are like rattlers, chattering incessantly and unnecessarily. “Hurry up! Move in! Quickly!” bellowed Mr. Hong impatiently. That was he norm of an everyday ride to school. God knows where Mr. Hong is rushing to. There was once, when a primary school student had forgotten to tap his EZ-Link card when he boarded the bus. Instead of reminding the primary school kid, Mr. Hong switched off the engine and sat silently still, eyes crossed beneath his chest, eyes closed. There was dead silence on the bus. No one knew what went wrong. Suddenly, he pushed open the panel obstructing his way, came out from his driver’s seat and walked towards where the boy was sitting and shouted out loudly, pointing his index finger at the boy’s forehead, “Hey boy! If you’ve got no money, don’t take my bus!” Everyone was flabbergasted by the callousness a man can expel onto a boy of such tender age. He immediately apologized, stood up and went to tap his card. Being the person I was, who believed strongly in equality, I stood up and went to Mr. Hong and let out a sudden outburst of anger exclaiming that he should have put it nicely to the boy. I knew I had offended a beastly creature. The next day, when he saw me running after the bus, he quickly asked his passengers to board the bus and closed the doors right in front of my face. He turned to me, gave me a smirk look and mouthed “Bye Be” and drove off. I was fuming, and a storm was brewing within me. The following day, I decided to go earlier than usual so that there’s no way he can drive away without me. Bus 186 came, and I boarded the bus, feeling a spurt of triumph. I tapped my card and shouted a “Yes!” to him. He replied me with a malicious grin and accelerated, leaving me to fight for balance. He knew he had won again. A few weeks later, he was fired as many publics lodged complaints regarding his hot-temperedness and verbal uncouthness. Indeed, the grass is not always greener on the other side.
