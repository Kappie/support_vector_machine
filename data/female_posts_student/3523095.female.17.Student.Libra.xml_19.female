Jeg messaged me that everything will be fine. I hoped so. But well, I did get screwed. Nevermind. If I don’t wake up now, then when am I going to? Its my fault la. I have to stop fooling around. FOC…if it continues in this way…the inevitable…..retain. gulp......boy..i hate that word. Had a bad enough experience already. Not ready to go through the same thing yet again. parents didn’t really scold. I believe they got sick of scolding me….i can understand.  Honestly, I haven’t been myself lately. Paranoia….it really sucks. Sigh….oh well, sorry for being so melancholic these days.    No mood ready.    Bubbye now...
