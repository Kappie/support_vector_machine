I need to let them out before I do explode. *sigh* Alright. First off...I guess I really don't understand guys...I just don't get it...why. *sigh* Whatever. Screw it. Family life sucks even more. Endless fights....*sigh* I want to get away. Im really thinkin bout just walking out and just keep walking...give myself time to feel relived n stuff. Im in so much pain it kills me. My life is just filled with tons of disapointment. *sigh* I have a very strong feeling that Ross is mad at me too. *sigh* I dunno... Just a lil over an hour ago I was laughing and having fun...now im sitting here crying..again. God. I don't know....Ross is probably mad cuz I vented alot on him...but I needed to get it out...Parents...God knows...various reasons. They just hate me. *sigh* Whatever. Im out.
