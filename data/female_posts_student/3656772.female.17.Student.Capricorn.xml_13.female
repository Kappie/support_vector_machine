Hell, I don't even know why anymore. I have no confidence, no strength, no passion, no joy; all I feel is annoyance, hate, frustration and anger towards everything. School's almost out, and finals are coming. I need to get my mental state under control or I'm going to have another break down during the test week.   God damn...It all just hurts so bad.
