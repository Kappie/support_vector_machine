My score is 520 points at a rating of 111.14%.  SUPER NERD.  I scored higher than Bill Gates.  Speaking of Nerds, I just came back from the Macworld convention.  Mac is now making an IPOD for Windows!  Whooohoo! Super MP3 players for my Win user friends!  I had the opportunity to be in the shadow of Steve Jobs as he made his rounds at the convention.  He even took a glimpse at my VIVA Las Vegas T-shirt with the scantily clothed VIVA girls.  OH my GOD  Steve Jobs likes my T-shirt.  The people from QuarkXpress was there and gave me a scaled version of their update to the professional page layout application.  Some freebies from Macworld magazine.(CDs/table coasters).  I cant believe MAC is releasing an upgrade to OS X and charging 200 smakaroons for a dot version upgrade.   More to come....  ~Net
