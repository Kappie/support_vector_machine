You do it all the time.  Easy to love, to give of yourself for a while.   It's easy to sweet talk. Anyone can do that. Words are free,adel. Words are free.  But commitment implies  bonding in such a way that  one promises to keep the fires of  love burning indefinitely.   It also means shutting one's heart to the  possibility of loving another who  might even be more attractive, even more lovable.  It is not easy.  This is why solid commitments are not at all as common as we are led to believe.   Love cannot be measured and that is a huge problem. I can love someone and tell him "I love you"  and I'm telling the truth. But how much do I love him? Enough to let him court me? Enough to want to marry him? Enough to be willing to die for him?  Which is it?   The greatest test of true love is commitment. And the greatest indicator of deep love is deep commitment. There can be no doubting this.   You often say all the right words, make all the right moves and pledge all that crappy everlasting undying love, But I know you'd walk away in weeks or months to come.  Maybe even overnight, You'd change. Faster than the speed of light.  Were we ever in love? Sure we were.  But not enough to allow us to hold strong in our love. Not enough to keep a commitment regardless of the pain.
