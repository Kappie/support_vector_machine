My Grandmoter died last year and she was partially blind due to Glaucoma(blood pressure in the eye).She moved back to the Philippines two years ago after my grandfather died.  She was much happier in PI since all her friends were there.  She got to go out and exercise, shop and go to the beauty parlor.  I think your uncle would get better care here in the US but as far as happiness, nothing beats being with people you know.  Its two weeks before my sisters wedding and my brother in law still hasnt ordered the tuxedo's  auurgh..   I just received word that my sister's former roomate Frances has a part in Aida the Disney musical in Broadway.  Woohoo!!!  If you guys want good seats for this play its good that you know someone that is part of it because they can get you good seating.  Full price seating but great seats!!!.  Okay enough plugging, I gotta get my own tickets too.  Dot wants to see it with me and her cousin Kathy.    I saw in the news that another volcano is erupting in Italy.  Wow, is this a sign of worse things to come?      Net
