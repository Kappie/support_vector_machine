Vince's roommate, MR. Shahin, again.  I cannot recall if I have entered MR. S into my blog yet, so let me catch you all up.  MR. V is out of the picture.  I scoped out the vince vibe for the last couple of weeks and there's nothing there.  Which I am fine with.  Honestly.  His roommate, however, is pretty into me.  I always hate saying that because it sounds so egotistical.  Plus, I am terrified of rejection so the minute I state that Mr. X is interested in me, the minute I open myself up to the pain of rejection if it turns out that Mr. X is not interested.  But it is true, Mr. S digs me.    The only problem is that I can't tell if I actually dig him, or if I am just bored.  I mean I like him as a person.  He's very funny, smart, nice, etc.  Maybe he talks a bit too much, but that's hardly a complaint that I have any right to make considering how much I talk.  His other problem is that I think he tries too hard to be cool. Another complaint I shouldn't be making.  After all, that's the story of my life: pretending I am something other than I am.    But after four shots of tequilla, I thought, hey why not? So I kissed him the middle of the bar.  It was worth it just to see the look on his face.  However, this sort of thing can be a very dangerous game to play.  Luckily I am out of this town in two months so I don't think the risk is too great.  That might have sounded egotistical too. oh well.  One of two things usually happens with the guys I date.  1) I fall madly in love with them and they dont' feel the same or 2) they fall madly in love with me and I don't fell the same.  Actually, come to think of it, the latter has not really happened.  I did dump MR. Leonard, Mr. Kaleb and Mr. Mike.  But I think in every case the boyfriend knew that the relationship had been over for some time and had just refused to admit it.  The former situation has happened exactly twice (MR. Andy, Mr. David).  And then there was the MR. Rod situation in which we both felt the same way but staying together was an impossibility.    BLah blah blah.  Sometimes I bore myself to death with my own writing.  In fact, I am so boring right now that I am going to do something mindless like update my profile.
