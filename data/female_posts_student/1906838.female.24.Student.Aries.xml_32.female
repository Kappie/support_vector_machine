Even though i dont think i have been very productive today shopping-wise , at least i found me a nice top to wear when i go see golliwog next week. i dont think i will dress up too much this time tho' .. cos golliwog will say i am overdoing it.. knowing him! The top i bought is nice and simple, and by my standards ( which are not very high!) kinda expensive. for the same price i could have bought more than one top. i still have to find a matching pair of trousers to go with it tho. aiyer.. tomoro is gonna be one crazy day .. looking for the trousers and buying souvenirs for everyone!  This morn i spoke to my dad about the exams. I could tell he was kinda disappointed that i couldnt really speak positively about my exams.. but as usual, he didnt show it. His disappointment is often masked by his favourite ,' as long as you tried your best ..', reassuring words. I said to dad, my written paper was so bad .. i wouldnt pass me if i were the examiner. But i did tell him tho' that the osces were good. hahaha... eza seems to think that because i felt i could do my osces, that would make me a good doctor. God, i hope so!
