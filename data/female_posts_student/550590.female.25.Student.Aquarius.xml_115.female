Only because I can't sleep...because sleeping requires the ability to breathe through one's nose.  It's been kind of a whirlwind month, but I'll try to sum it up as briefly as possible.  Went flat broke twice, spoke at a conference, trained some new interns, trained a shitload of volunteers, caught hell from my mom a lot, celebrated an assload of birthdays, got interviewed by a local tv station only to experience first hand the age-old communications theory of Agenda Setting in action, started a fundraising campaign for a foster care center, helped to marchman act a client, interviewed in office volunteers, campaigned for a pay increase and won, campaigned against a competitor program and kind of lost, worked on a book, mastered The Sims, spent lots of time with Bruce, and spent a whole lot of time neglecting my online friends.  I'm sorry ya'll.  I'm still learning that wonderful art of balancing having a wonderful loving boyfriend with having so many wonderful friends.  I hope you all don't feel that I don't love or miss you.  I'm just inanely busy with everything going on at work lately.  But I promise to try to get in touch with you all very soon.  Info about the Halloween party should be up for your viewing pleasure relatively soon.  For now just know that it's going to kick ass, and you should be there.    More timely blogs to come, I promise.  ~Dan~
