Yeah, you are right, I'll be fine, but most  importantly I'll be so drugged up I won't care. haha.  Thats a joke, sort of, not really.         On to the point of this entry.  Rachel likes to take cheap shots at people sometimes, most recently being the-ex-from-feb, but I must say he can still be my friend, he is not worthless or a pig, I just like to call people names sometimes, okay, alot of the time, okay anytime they piss me off.  Yeah so he was kind of a punk, but probably didn't deserve being drawn and quartered, then burned at the stake by me.  Actually he has been a prominent member of the group that has checked on me and asked if I was okay.  He brought me a compensatory dmgs pizza today.         Okay now that I have partially retracted earlier statements, I thought I would let ya'll know that I'll be staying at the regent park hotel at the Munich airport tomorrow, as its a good 20 km outside the city and my plane leaves before the sun is even awake.  When did it get to be after 6 pm?  Back to my book, C. got me onto Marian Keyes.
