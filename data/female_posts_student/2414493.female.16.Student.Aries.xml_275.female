I change the viewing angle and see that it's not the same anymore. I try to rub the black off the 4runner, but it doesn't come off. I think the black is the underlying plastic and the silver is the paint.  I stood where Mom's beloved usually rests and I imagine the intersection of the trusty minivan and my silver giant, if you will.  I sigh.  If anything, I'm glad that it happened to the van instead of some stranger's car. But Mom shouldn't have parked that close, and I shouldn't have backed out so carelessly. I just put the car into reverse and the next thing I heard was the mirror closing on the Odyssey. It isn't that major. I don't see any reason for either car to be fixed, and the Odyssey's damage is less visible than the 4runner's, which hopefully placates Mom in some demented sense.  I saw her get out of the car at the gate yesterday, when we left together, her in the van. She looked at the side and got back in. She didn't yell at me or anything. She even waved to me at the intersection. She didn't bring it up all of last night, was happily showing me things to eat after I got home.   And then it all slams on me. Today.  Let me put the big picture together for you.   Driving to get Austin after school today, I was like, hey this is nice. I should have something to do like this every day after school of finals week. I'm going to graduation Thursday, but Friday. Ah, Friday. I should do something.  And then I come home. The movie's about to go on when Mom calls and starts yelling at me. The charges: 1. I should be studying during finals week. She came in this morning before 7 to make sure that I didn't have to be at school at the regular time and then proceeded to tell me that maybe the movie and lunch weren't such a good idea. I persuaded her otherwise. I don't think she believed me. She said I should save fun for after school ends. Little does she know, I have Disneyland in my arsenal. Now that I think about it, Boston's going to be endless fun too.  2. I shouldn't have been driving Nimo home from the Promenade. Oh, it was such a bad fake, and I'm a bad thinker in the heat of the moment. The phone rings, Nimo picks up. I don't know who it is except I have an inkling that it's mom since caller ID says it's from "unknown." Mom wants to speak to me and I tell Nimo to tell her that I'M DRIVING. Mom proceeds to lecture me how much a human life costs in the United States. She tells me I have to turn in my keys after school every day or else she's going to have to start driving me to school. Well, the fact that school's almots over is on my side. But I still like to have the keys in my pocket as some measure of "autonomy" and "independence."   3. My friends were still over at 10 minutes to 4. I'd estimated that I'd be done by 4, but then I had to pick up Austin, which took up 40 minutes. Well, even then it would've been closer to 5. I know she doesn't like so many people over all of a sudden. There were...let me see...nine people. I know Grandma isn't happy for sure. I can't blame that one on anyone.  4. And the car thing. So she found out.  I don't know how to make it up to her, except that I am really sorry for some of the things. The car, for one, bugs me the most. That, and driving Nimo. I cleaned up after my friends left, so hopefully no mess will remind her that they ever visited. I don't see why she's so anal about finals. I'll do extra chores or anything, I just want to keep the keys.   It's a nominal thing, those keys. I'm not going to go anywhere without her permission (usually) but I don't like the inflexibility of asking her for them every time I have to go somewhere. I'm too sorry to lie to her. I just wish she'd understand that I don't have major finals work and that I just want to relax for a bit.  Life goes on, doesn't it?
