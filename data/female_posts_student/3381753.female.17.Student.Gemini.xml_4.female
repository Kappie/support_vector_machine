I did enjoy some classes, but sitting in french on my very last day of school with my best friend ever was a little difficult. I cried almost all the way through my next class.   Then I came home and slept for about two hours. I miss Adam so much. He has been spending a lot of time with Paul lately. I don't like the idea of that much because Paul is a major pot head now. Adam has quit all of that, I don't want him  pressured. And he obviously was on Tuesday night when he was so drunk he doesn't remember getting high.   I want to see him so bad. I just called him and he and Paul are going to the Casino. They were actually on their way out the door when I called. Hmm. I want to cry I miss him so much.   Well my tummy hurts from sleeping and I need some food in my stomach.
