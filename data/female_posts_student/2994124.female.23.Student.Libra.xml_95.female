I was in the computer room trying to do my assingment and suddenly started getting pain in my chest, then it spread to my back and I couldn't breathe in deeply because of the shearing pain.  My throat felt like it was being burnt by acid.  After the intial "Oh my God I'm dying" I decided that it was probably just heartburn.  But then I started feeling really sick and ended up dashing to the loos and being violently ill.  So eventually decided to go and see the nurse.  Felt like such an idiot. But she was lovely and said that it probably was heartburn but that some people get chronic milder symptoms and others get acute severe pain.  She said the she herself had only had it twice and both times thought she was dying.  So that made me feel much better.  So I'm not dosed up with DISGUSTING Gaviscon - which is like this chalky, milky drink that is totally foul.  So apart from that, work still going - assignment still not done - but have tomorrow now as creche has been cancelled.  No other exciting news - sorry.  xxx
