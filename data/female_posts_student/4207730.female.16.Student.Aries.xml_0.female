He pretty much brought his whole room. lol. dorm life, this should be fun!the girls there seem like spoiled bitches, I can sense the drama already!! girls these days,lol...we pretty much spent the whole day in CHico and went out to the Olive Garden for dinner. we left at 9 and got home at 12.  Today I didn;t feel like visiting any friends, I just stayed home. I was in the cleaning mood, so I cleaned my whole room and bathroom. Tomorrow I need to clean my closet, I have so much shit in there,lol. Tomorrow night we're going to Tahoe...greeaaat, i dont wanna go. its sooo boring there! Maybe I'll ask if a friend could go with me! that'll be cool.
