Well, not really nothing.  See, I was driving towards 63 on Broadway by the hospitals (you mid-Mo types know the place) and someone upfront of our rush-hour slug of traffic decides at the last minute they want to go to the hospital on the left instead of the right.  Slamming brakes and lane changes ensue.  The Camaro in front of me screeched to a halt and tried to pull out in the other lane to avoid wrecking, but apparently my brakes are no match for the  massive increase in gravity that a 15-degree downward slope will cause, and I slid right into her rear bumper.  I lamented loudly in Greek chorus fashion and we pulled off to the side of the road.  I watched the back of Red Camaro's head shaking violently as she whipped out her cellphone and dialed a few numbers.  Shit...she looked pissed.   When we got out, though, she was extremely concerned about my well being, which made me wonder if it was a little bit her fault.  We called the police, who were already, magically, cognizant of the accident and who promised to meet us posthaste.     Thirty minutes later, we had run about things to talk about as the stuff she knows (highlightin hair and REEEALLY needing to get back to the Kappa house for chapter meeting) and the stuff I know (being a musician and REAAALLY needing to get to Jeff City to teach my lessons and make my sixty bucks) didn't exactly intersect.  Finally, one of the Community Service Aide cars (we didn't even get first tier service after our ass-long wait) blocked traffic and a hulking butch lady in the style of that one character on Girl, Interrupted who was committed for beign gay got out of the "squad car".  Here is what transpired:  Butch Cop:  "Ma'am (I'm ma'am) I'll need your driver's license, proof of insurance, and your version of what happened:  Me:  Fumbling with papers and dropping pin.  "Shit...sorry.  Uh, what I can remember involved someone turning left at the last minute, everyone slamming on their brakes and trying to avoid each other.  I was the last person in the mess and I just couldn't avoid hitting her.  I tried to swerve...I braked in time....it just didn't happen".  Sorority Girl: "I totally don't think she could have avoided hitting me.  No one could.  I think it was no-fault".  Butch cop:  "Unfortunately we don't have a no-fault rule here in Missouri.  Sorority girl, your license is expired, but feel free to go on your way in your Camaro with no repercussions. You, ma'am will need to show up in court for your hearing regarding obscure city ordinance 1-416".    Me: "Uh...don't you want to take an accident report or look at damage or anything?"    Her:  "I'll do it later.  I have a good memory."  So, seriously.  Butch Cop didn't even look to see what the damage was. (Camaro Girl's:  nothing except two paint scratches.  Me:  total annihilation of the front bumper.  I hate my car.)  And I have this ticket, whose ordinance refers to the following:  "Failure to take measures to avoid a collision".  WTF?  Do they think I just put my hands up, flipped off my insurance company, rolled down the hill and yelled, "Woooooo!" the whole way?  Utter bullshit, man.    So anyway.  I have this court date.  The fine can be anywhere from a dollar to a thousand dollars, quoth Butch Cop.  Can you do time served on traffic violations?  It might be fun...    Anyway, check out  urlLink the link  I added under Piss Off Your Boss.   Extremely funny and perfect for people like me who pretend they're New Yorkers in their heads when they're really looking for garbanzo beans in a Super Wal-Mart.
