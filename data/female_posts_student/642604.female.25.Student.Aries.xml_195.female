I have to admit that the kids made the movie far more than Jack Black did, which is unfortunate since I love Jack Black.  It's about this guy, Dewey Finn, who gets kicked out of the band he put together because of his lavish ways while playing onstage.  Now I have to interject and say a nice surprise was to see that Adam Pascal was fronting this band.  For those of you who don't know who Adam Pascal is, he is a very talented singer who has taken Broadway by storm... he owned and made famous the role of Roger in Rent and he also kicked off the role of Rodames in Elton John and Tim Rice's AIDA.  He's done a small performance in the great movie SLC Punk although he doesn't sing.  But here he is singing in a movie and I LOVE IT!  That being said... now back to the slightly lame movie.  So Dewey gets kicked out of the band and he has to pay rent.  So his roommate is a substitute teacher and after leaving for work one day Dewey takes a call that a prep school needs a substitute on an emergency basis.  Of course Dewey poses as Ned (the roommate) and goes to substitute.  He's bored out of his mind and these kids are uber overachievers.  So he hears them in their music class and of course a couple of them are prodigys and he gets the idea that he wants to go up in the battle of the bands that his original band was preparing for, using these kids.  So he gets his kids together and they spend their days learning rock.  He teaches one of them how to use her larger than life annoying personality to become the band manager, he teaches some of the non-musical kids to be security and groupies.  He engages one kid's talents to do the light show and create a multimedia presentation, he teaches one kid with stage fright because she's worried that people will laugh at her because she's fat that talent supercedes weight.  It's got a few hidden good messages and you find yourself smiling through the end but I have to tell you the laughs are few and far between.  I love Jack Black but he needs to just stick to doing ensemble work when there is someone else to help carry the movie.  Just my opinion.    urlLink Underworld   I dug this movie.  It's basically the continuation of a war that has been raging for centuries between the Lycans, which is another name for Warewolves, and the Vampires.  Celine, a vampire, is the main character of the story and she discovers that the Warewolf leader that she thought was killed according to Vampire lore is very much alive.  Celine discovers that the Warewolves are stalking humans to turn and place on their side.  She finds they are stalking specific lines of humans and one of these is Michael.  Celine, played by Kate Beckinsale, is beautiful and is quite the poster child for goth while Michael, played by Scott Speedman, is gorgeous and is a confused human who is bitten by one of the Lycans.  Celine and Michael have an instant attraction and Celine keeps Michael safe from the Lycan clan as well as Kraven the leader of the vampires who wants Celine and therefore wants Michael dead.  The plot itself is not that revolutionary but it's just a fun and beautifully done.  It's a ton of action and more fight scenes then dialogue but I have to say it was just a fun movie and I very much enjoyed it.
