Ok my New Years Resolutions:  -Eat healthier (We all know thats not going to happen..and no..i don't think i am fat) -Do more yoga and excercise ( Dont make fun of me..yes i do yoga) -Work harder in school -Stop spending so much money when i have the chance (I have a disease..its unhealthy) -Try and help friends work things out if they have a problem  I think thats pretty good so far even though  the first 2 and the 2nd last that i said is highly unlikely for me to do..I can still try...right?  Right?
