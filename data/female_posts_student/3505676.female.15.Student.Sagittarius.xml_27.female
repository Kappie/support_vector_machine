I wish that Calgary had won but oh well...thnx for telling me when they scored tho brad! *haha* Everyone headed out around 11 or 11 30 then me, jana, and christine, stayed over, decorated and ate the cake, then told 'stories' til the middle of the night!  Yesterday was pretty good, cinnamon rolls 4 breakfast thanks to andrew and watching UGLY make over stories on TLC.  I swear they gave them the worst clothes and make up i have EVER seen! *ick* Went swimming w/ Jill @ opt. then it thundered so the pool closed right before i started my shift but i still had plenty of work to do cuz we were getting tons of fone calls.  Work was good, read more of Anna Karenina because hardly anyone was there, cept someone screwed up the register earlier so we were 9 bucks short..screw that [[oh well we fixed it]] Watched tv..talked on the fone..normal night! No work today cept for an inservice tonight for an hour.
