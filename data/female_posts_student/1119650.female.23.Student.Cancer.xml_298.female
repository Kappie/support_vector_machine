(Sales guys at EB in the Pallisades center, I'm looking in your direction).  2)  Picking on New Jersey leads to a slew of commenty backlash.  Apologies are in order to  urlLink Lisa ,  urlLink Michael (Not Mike) ,  urlLink Petrina  and  urlLink Patches .  It was just a good natured ribbing.  I mean look at me I'm from CT (Picture Wayne  Garth in front of a CT post card saying "we're in CT...it uh...connects better states").  3)  Even if you're a girl who generally sucks at video games, its possible for one of them to take over your life.  ::cough::Zelda::cough::  4)  Tis the season to hit up the  urlLink zoo .  Not only am I taking a field trip with all of my fine feathered blogging friends to the Bronx zoo tomorrow, but  urlLink Mo  also had a zoo adventure this week.  She rules, go read her blog, damn it!  5)  June babies are the best.   urlLink Anna's  b-day is in 17 days,  urlLink Boz's  bday is in 6 days, and my divalicious day of birth is in 22 days.  Put on your party hats, mother bitches.  We expect blog mention on our big days!
