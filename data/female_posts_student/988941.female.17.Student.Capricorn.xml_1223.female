Yea I know you have work, so does everyone else but it only takes a few minutes to write a few lines. And both of you type fast so, um, yea.  But anyway. I have noticed that on tusedays when Paul is at work I actually come home and get on with work rather than sitting on msn until he comes on. LOL. So now I have nearly finished a wall hanging. Only 2 things left to finish for textiles which I should be able to do by Friday. But now I have about 3/4 pieces for art to finish so, um, pants.
