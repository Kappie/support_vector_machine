So I started this one so noone will know, only the people I want to know my deepest, darkest thoughts haha. Which is only like 3 people. Annnnwaaaays...so tonight is officially the last night of the summer for staying up late, so I'm planning on staying up until at least 1, which I doubt will happen cuz I am bored out of my mind...There is noone on!!!!!!!!!! But I HAVE to make myself wake up early, and I do mean early! We're talking 6, 6:30 am, cuz I have to be able to make myself go to bed early tomorrow night. And then I have to begin my senior year of highschool on Tuesday! YIPEE!!! No, not really...ugh I'm dreading it. 1: I do not want to go back to school! (what happened to the summer anyways??) 2: I am absolutely, positively not ready to graduate! (what do I do next???). I have no idea which college I am going to go to, or what I want to go to college for! HELP!!! Sure I have a couple of ideas (Cleveland State, NCSC, OSU) but I'm not positively sure. So I am going to make this last year of school memorable...haha, yeaaaahh riiight...I say that every year! And I ALWAYS end up hating the whole freaking year. Maybe if I'm lucky I'll have a boyfriend this year HAHA :/ I do have a lot more confidence and am more outgoing than I used to be...I dunno, we shall see what happens...Anyways, lets discuss what I did today...NOTHING! haha, well I did make myself wake up at 7! So I'm kinda tired right now...I stumbled out to the kitchen and saw that my mom was making eggs, ugh I can not eat anymore eggs, I'm sooo sick of them!!!! So I poured myself a bowl of Corn Pops (mmm mmm) and collapsed on the chair to gobble them down. Then of course I had to feed my kitties (so cute). After that I decided I was too tired to function properly so I laid back down on my bed to snooze for a little bit more...Plus I was freezing!!! When I heard my dad leave, I went out to watch Godsend w/ my mom (that is one fuhreaky movie!) After the movie ended, I hopped in the shower to begin my getting for work ritual. 2 hours later (haha) I went to work. Well that was soooo much exciting, I pretty much did nothing alllll night...and let me tell you, that was loooads of fun. Got home at 9, ate some ice cream annnndd....Tada! Here I am! Typing my fingers off! Well, I think this was a successful first post, I do have  some  experience (hehe). Hope you (whoever you refers to ??) enjoyed...
