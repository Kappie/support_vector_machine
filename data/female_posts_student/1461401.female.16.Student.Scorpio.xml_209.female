The only thing I could see was a bunch of strange neon green lines and a lot of black. Mom helped me back inside where she made me sit down. When she did that, I managed to get my vision back, but there was a strange rushing noise in my ears. Mom said that that means I had almost fainted. That's happened at least three more times today. Then she took my temperature. 101.0 degrees. That was actually kind of funny. How can a person have that kind of temperature, and yet not be able to stop shivering? I laid down on the couch for a while, but I was very cold and didn't get any kind of restful sleep. I had some breakfast and a lot of pills and more attempted sleep. Around 2:30 alex called me to see if I was ok and that made me happy. For a while now I've been able to walk around without too much trouble, but then again, I really have taken a lot of medication in the last 11 hours, so I'd better not push my luck. I missed school. I really wish I hadn't had to take a day off. I hate missing work. *gags* Alright, well I'm starting to feel rreeaallllyy hot (at least I'm not shivering anymore) so I'm gonna go lay down or something. ttfn ta ta for now
