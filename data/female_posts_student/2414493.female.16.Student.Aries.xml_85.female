So the shirts go back on the hangers, Mom's stuff goes back to her place, dirty clothes go in the hamper...and the cover goes back on that purple dress.  I tried it on today. For old times' sake. And I can't help but admire the sequins, the flowers, and all the memories that come along with it. And I just have to come to the conclusion that it was just too good for that event. Purple dress brings back memories of that night on the field and in the truck, but also awkwardness and funny walks and the baseball bleachers and sprinklers.  I won't call it sacrifice, but that was a lot to put in to one dress, to two nights. And I hope I've grown up enough not to repeat the feat again.  Can growth be categorized in dresses?
