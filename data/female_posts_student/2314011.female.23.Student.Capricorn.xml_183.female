Full of twists and turns, excitements and adventures, some more enjoyable than others.  But they've all lead to this place and, as promised by the stars, was all worth it.    H'OK, SO...  much time has been spent sorting out the whole 'where is this going' question.  I know, before you even start yelling at your computer, I KNOW!  It's too much thinking, over-thinking, planning and re-planning.  I'm working on it, okay?  Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that I'm down for the ride; I'm ready to see what's coming and where this will take us.  I'm game for whatever happens.  And that's a new place to be, really.  I'm not one who gives up control or its illusion easily, especially when there's no indication or assurances of what  could  or  might be  happening.  Haven't quite gotten down the art of trusting in nothing but a feeling, but it's getting easier.  But finally emerging from the haze of trying to pin every possibility down and analyzing it to death in order to figure out if its a winner or not was pretty liberating and lived up to all the hype.    And that's how the week began.  Open and ready for whatever came next.  Just wasn't ready for what ended up happening (do we see a pattern, here?).   SO YEA...  couldn't find this new girl consuming many of my thoughts.  Our schedules are kinda scattered to begin with and our conversations thus far have been fitted into whatever open slots come our way, so it wasn't too big a deal at first.  Before long, though, started worrying about something I may have said, not said, done, not done, etc.  Of course, now we have that wonderful friend, hindsight, to show us the truth of the circumstances, but at the time, I just had a mind reeling with too many possibilities and explanations that may or may not be the case because I couldn't talk to the one person who could reassure me.  Maybe she just needed time to digest everything; maybe she was caught up in personal issues having nothing to do with me; maybe...  You get the idea.    AND SO...  I tried to give her what it appeared she needed, space and time.  But patience has never been one of my strong points, especially when the situation involves someone I care about.  I want whatever the problem is to be fixed yesterday, especially if there's anything I can do to fix it.  But I couldn't do anything here because I didn't know what was going on in the first place.    AND THEN...  came home from work last night, trying to be strong, trying to be brave, and almost convinced myself I could pull off the whole 'patient' thing when it became quite apparent I needed to do some evening pages (the evening counterpart to morning pages).  Sure enough, they did their job.  And after about half an hour of quality pen and paper time (while watching a flash flood outside the window, appropriately enough), I looked up, felt incredibly lighter and as though something had finally been released for good.  By the end of writing everything out, I was smiling. Because the ride's been a wonderful one and whatever happens, it's been worth it; wouldn't change a thing.  I could wait forever to hear from her again, if that's what she needed.    AND REALLY...  the only thing to do after a major breakthrough in understanding yourself is to put on the new Alanis Morissette CD while doing some hard-core yoga, and I'll be goddamned if it's not a pretty good album!  As a brief aside, the CD is pretty much like all the others:  hate it at first, then it's okay, and pretty  soon it's kinda alright!  Yes, there's some songs that just suck, and this whole 10-song thing is complete shit, but the good songs, are really great and I can't get enough of them.  Then curled up on the couch and finished the first Harry Potter book, which is such the perfect re-introduction to reading for pleasure.  Thanks, Emily.  You Rock.    AND THEN...  around 3, the phone rings.  And I jump out of bed, run to the phone and am sooo excited that we're doing the late-night, 'I couldn't wait until morning' call, only to find someone else on the other end.  Fine, it's my friend April and we have a few laughs before she graciously lets me go back to sleep, trying to maintain the new peace and understanding I'd found.    SO TODAY...  managed to keep the momentum going from the night before.  Made it through the day without planning a damn thing or over-analyzing a single thought.  How novel!!  And sure enough, after my most excellent yoga class, I had a message waiting for me and a gal to talk to.  She's been sick all week, poor thing.  Spending the days in bed or in doctor's offices, talking with people who don't know how to help her; unable to do everything she wants to do: be with her friends before they all become scattered, talk to and take care of the people she cares about, etc.  She's been resigned to bed rest and that's the worst.      AND SOOO...  we chatted for the first time since Monday night and it was perfect.  Comfortable, easy and adorable.    FINALLY...  here I find myself, still here, still smiling (while shaking my head at myself), feeling good all over, and down for whatever else the stars have in mind.  Yes, you were right, dear friends and dear horoscopes: patience, going with the flow, and giving up the tight hold on invisible reigns are our new friends.  I apparently need to have the same lesson given over and over before it starts to sink in, but each time, I get the hang of it a bit better.    (cue exhausted, self-deprecating, contended sigh)
