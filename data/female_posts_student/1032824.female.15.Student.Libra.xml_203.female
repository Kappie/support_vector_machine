Seets, the Turkish ice-cream man looked really cute in the photo! Hahaha, Seets is  in loooove .  Anyhoos, today was, I would describe as, sinful. I had chocolate truffle, blueberry danish with vanilla ice cream, Italian pizza, baked beef lasagna and heaps more. Feeling a tad guilty now, hahaha. ;) Kalyn you were great today and I can't wait til' Weds!   Kalyn and I caught The Simple Life on telly yesterday and it was really amusing! Paris Hilton actually thought that Wall Mart was a place where they sold walls. If Jiax hears this she's going get so mad! Hahaha.   Happy Fathers' Day! My Dad has gone to climb Mount Kinabalu with my uncle and will return only on Thursday. My Dad is an amazing person and I love him so much. I hope he knows how to fold the sleeping bag. (o'_'o)    Spell of the day:  Riddikulus  (ri-di-KYOO-lus) Defense against a Boggart, forces the creature to take on a silly appearance.
