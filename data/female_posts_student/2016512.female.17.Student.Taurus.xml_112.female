(tuberculosis anyone?) my mom comes in and seems to brush my problems aside and i sob because i don't know what's wrong with me.   sadly i woke up with a coarse throat and numerous questions on my mind. i asked my mom about it. she thinks i might have actually been wretching while i was sleeping as if acting the part of my dream. (which i have been known to do on several occassions) well that's dream 1 open for interpretation. *shudder*  dream 2 was more of modge podge of random crack. it was really twisted and i found my self with the worst television characters imaginable, including: lizzie maguire (drawing version), homer simpson, the son from Married with Children, and i some how remember the blue door from Notting Hill somewhere in my dream. i don't remember the whole dream just bits and pieces. i know i had to look for someone and also i had to flip a house right side up by standing on a porch railing and fighting the massive waves. does this make sense? no it doesn't make sense to me either.  well needless to say i have had terrible sleep all week. my earliest sleeping has been 1:30am and my latest 2:30am. great! just what i needed to start of a hectic week filled with leadership and never looked at mission statements. haha they're not gonna get much out of me! oh well i hope it will be a bit better than girls state.   i went to the F*squared* yesterday. it was alright. i realize how over rated it all is. i don't know maybe it's because i half the people i ran into there i didn't really want to run into. oh well i know a lot of you can feel my pain. i did however talk to a long time friend from elementary school. i hadn't talked to him since 8th grade. oh well it was fun. he's changed a lot but i can tell he's still the same guy. i remember, his mom practically adopted me and was quite bitter that she never had a girl. other than that the county fair was harmless i didn't play any games. the carnies did not hit on me. *score* and i didn't get sick on any of the rides. i had my first funnel cake ever. not to shabby. but yes it's done and now i'm all faired out and i don't plan on going for a while.  oh ps. my senior pic proofs are in. props to brettness' family for doing a awesome job. i'm having a heck of time pickin' my favorites. though everyone else seems to have their favs set in stone. well we'll see what happens. hopefully i can get some of your opinions.  it's nice not to have to deal with carpet shananigans, but other than that there's still packing and errands to be run, which will have to be done in a short period of time. great! see you all in a week.  Only fools do as such, -Betso
