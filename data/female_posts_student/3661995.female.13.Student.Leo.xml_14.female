Yes, I want to go to the Free Country, a world without adults, a world where children can be free to do what they want, what they like. It's a world especially for children. No pain, no hatred, no anger, no threats. Nothing, just freedom.  You may think that we are free now, but think again. No! We are bound, by ties of loyalty, work, friendship, kinship. That is no freedom!  This world now bores me. Maybe, if I die, I'll be able to get to there. What more should I want? The Free Country will porvide for its children. Whatever they want, she will conjure up.  This world has lost its magic; the people have turned to rely on science and technology. They have forgotten the ancient magic that binds us to this world.  I'm sick and tired of everything. I nned a rest. Feelings are like a gust of wind to me. It comes and goes, and leaves no traces. I have just noticed, that I have never really felt happy before. Honest. I can't remember anything happening to me that makes me truly glad. I think I'll be dead by now if I come face to face with dementors; I won't be able to do the Patronous charm thing.  It's like everyday, something has to make me angry or sad. I have such limited feelings. Yeah, I laugh, but I'm not happy. I'm just amused; by the antics of people, sunken deep in the rabbit's fur. I'm laughing. At them. Their foolishness, their so dull life. Pity.  I feel so dark and depressed. So gloom filled. I'm cold inside, there's like a cold rain pouring in my heart.  I can't feel much now. I'm numbed. Empty. Dead. Seriously, I doubt that I have ever been alive. Yeah, life doesn't really suit me. huh, I can't hardly feel my pulse, but it's still there. I'm still living. What a newsflash. Hahahahaha...how ridiculously funny. Hahahahahahahahahaha
