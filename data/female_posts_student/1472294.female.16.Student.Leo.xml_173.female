I love their screensaver, you download it for free and even if you select the free ones (NOT the expensive ones), the pictures are just so beautiful... You can even select one of their pictures to my desktop wallpaper, but you must once in a while go and update it. The picture was taken during the sunset at a seashore, so enchanting and calming to my tense nerves.... Go and download now! ---http://www.eyetide.com/index.jsp---
