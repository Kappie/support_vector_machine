I can’t live without.  Nothing is like what it seams Behind this cold attitude I’m soft like a feather I’m sweet like honey I’m innocent like a child I’m a dreamer.  I’ll always be The helping hand The caring word The lighting smile The welcome embrace The one sided love Your Friend… Till my last day  ]-[ellMistress
