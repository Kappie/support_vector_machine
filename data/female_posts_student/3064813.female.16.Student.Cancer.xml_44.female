I got to skip school on Friday, which made me sad because I didn't get to see my friends there, but I was also happy because we went to the beach. At the beach I was sad because we were attacked and pooed upon by seagulls.  I was happy at the beach because we terrorized fellow beachers and beat up the waves with great vigor. Upon the completion of our mini-stay at the beach I was utterly wiped out and slept on the way home.  Once AT home, the children were fed fake pizza and made to watch Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.  Brittney's small brother Austin enjoyed this greatly, while I amused myself otherwise by the visual and audio consumption of Eddie Izzard, the transvestite.  This was fun.  I then wished to enjoy more mind numbing television, but was hampered by the fact that everyone else hungered for bedtime.  I strove mightily for an extended amount of time awake, but alas, I failed.  So, I slept. And then I woke up and ate a Krispy Kreme thing, which made me sick.  I ate another one because it was tasty, and that made me sick too.  We then watched Independence Day, which was followed by great whooping and hollering because it is a kickass movie, involving Will Smith and shiny objects. I am unfortunately encountering great distress because I am feeling homicidal and am desperately needing "alone time".  Alas, as there is company, I am reduced to being short and waspish, which led to what I fear was a rather rude greeting to my friend.  As soon as I am given a moment I shall dial her number and wait for someone to pick up the phone, thereby saving me from the monotonous ringing, and I will then apologize for being short. But, I must go.  FARE THEE WELL!
