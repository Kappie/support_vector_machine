Then we began running.. i was doing so good the first mile, it was such a relief, i was going to make it. Then i got into a vacuum - then i got dizzy -then i began not being able to see the lines on the track - then i began really wanting to stop - then i ended up having to slow down to a ridiculous pace - then i got passed by like a bajillion people - for stats, i did my first mile in 5:52 - the second was in 6:36. Nice minute drop off. - anyway, then i collapsed and they had to carry me off - now i've been sulking all day. nice life.
