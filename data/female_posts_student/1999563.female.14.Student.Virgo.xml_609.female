But I am finally decided on my style for school this year...  I am going to a be a guitar rocker chick! Hahahahhahaha!!  Becasue playing the guitar is totally in style. [well...maybe not as much for acoustic..electric guitars rock!]  I feel wierd going to the mall though. I mean everyone goes to the mall. Everyone looks the same. I don't want to look like all the mall goers! I want to look like LAURA!! It's so hard though.  It seems like the only way I can be the only one who has my clothes is to either make me own clothes [which I have totally tried but it didn't work] or buy designer [which is totally not an option]  I think I am going to take a class on how to make my own clothes. That would rock!
