Just in case you're wondering, I don't do much in English rehearsals - so far I just took some pictures and stood in for people who weren't there. For Chinese, it's been great fun (of course, I'm sure we'll also benefit from all this, and not only "have fun") rehearsing "zhen1 xin1" and my line "me1" (?) with Veron and CS ( we  I still can't get it right!) At this point in time, I feel that I have already learnt quite alot from this whole production. I've learnt about how we go about making a production, rehearsals, and about how you  must  listen to others and take in others' advice, to make everything work well (i.e. what Veron and Mich are doing really well). If I may say so, I think this production is bringing our class a little closer together, and making everyone more cooperative, more responsible people (sorry if the sentence looks/sounds weird, I didn't know how to phrase it properly).. :) Jia you, everyone (especially the main cast), in whatever else you have to do for the production! Oh, and also, I must add that the directors (for both Engilsh and Chinese) are  great ! Keep up the good work! :)
