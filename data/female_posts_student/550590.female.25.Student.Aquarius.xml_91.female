When you call it, it rings busy, even when it's not, and when you attempt to dial up on computer or use a phone, it makes terrible noises...much like the groans of the spiderman audience upon seeing Ryan's and my rendition of attaching a spider web to the building as we exited the theatre. (It sounds weird now, but it was really, really fuckin funny at the time.)  I was also informed by a strange man in the theatre lobby that there was never a Spidergirl but there should have been and I could be her.  Hmm...SO bottom line, my phone line is possessed, so I have to either hang out in the living room or type in the dark in my parents' bedroom...neither of which is a pleasant experience.  But hey, at least tomorrow we're going to Melting Pot.  Yummy.
