The sex wouldn't bother me, the gore would. Because  Clockwork Orange  is one of those movies that is contstantly being alluded in media and in conversation, I thought maybe I would watch it to see what the commotion was about. Is it the kind of movie that would give me nightmares?   I saw the latest David Lynch film  Mulholland Drive . If you like David Lynch's work, then you would probably like it. I don't really care for Lynch's movies. Then again, I don't enjoy being disturbed for entertaintment. My own life disturbs me enough.   Well, I'm going to disappear again. I'm finally getting my business license. So, I'm off to build my own business as an independent contractor. Also, I'm going to go through a Reiki attunement so I will be resting for about 21 days starting Sunday.
