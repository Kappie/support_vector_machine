If you do your math properly, you'll realize you still owe me $448 fucking dollars, and because you took that extra money out you've caused me to already bounce 2 things that wouldn't have bounced if you didn't fuck up.  I sincerely hate you from the deepest depths of my blackened, disillusioned soul and I expect that you better cover me the $60 in overdraft fees that you made my bank charge me or else you're gonna have a war on your hands.  I was  really  looking forward to my big Vegas trip, but now I don't want to have anything to do with you.  Please go rot.  Rar.  Dieplz, Gwen
