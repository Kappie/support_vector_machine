We're on the Turnpike driving along, minding our own business when, at the Reading exit, this asshole car decides that traffic isn't moving fast enough so he  drives down the middle  of the road. Down the middle! The poor old guy he cut off must have shit his pants, I know I almost did. Then there was all the rain ... terrential downpours are not the most fun thing to be outside in. Hydroplaning (although not the safest thing in the world) was a lot of fun, seeing as we didn't hit anything. But the most fun of the entire day came after we were off of the Turnpike and in a crappy residential section of eastern PA.      There was an accident on North 100, and unfortunately we got caught in the line of traffic ... right as we get up to the point where we could go around it, this police SUV goes in front of us. Well, not exactly in front of us - it blocked the other lane, and about 3 inches of the front of it were in our lane. Ashley and I, confused as ever, decided that we would just go around it because it wasn't really blocking our lane. So we do that. Big mistake people! The cop slams on his horn and pulls up next to us and screams "pull onto that road up there and get a ticket!" I start reassuring Ashley that everything will be okay, but inside we were both panicking and I'm getting ready to turn on the waterworks to get us out of this ticket. Turns out, I didn't have to do anything, he noticed that we were from out-of-town and let us go. Even gave us directions since that was the first time we got lost.      After that, we basically got lost about a dozen times, had to pull over and ask about seven random people how to get to West Chester University (people really need to learn about the town they live in, for real). But we made it there. Eventually. And all the driving was worth it ... those people are pretty nice.      Only real downside to my day was not getting a call back from Andy. But whatever. The boy is busy, me thinks.      Sch   Your Sweetest b.
