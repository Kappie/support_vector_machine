At 7o'clock tonight on PBS. Yeah. I remember at EIGHT THIRTY SIX! cuss cuss cuss! ugh! but-- on the bright(er) side, it goes till 10, so yeah. but it doesnt make me feel any better that's for sure...=-/ And it's *of course* not one of those -few- shows that'll get rebroadcasted at a later date... oh no... that would make it WAY to easy for me, right? ha yeah. shoot shoot ShOOT! ...I'm not looking so forward to this call now...=-/ not half as much as I was just 2 hours ago=(
