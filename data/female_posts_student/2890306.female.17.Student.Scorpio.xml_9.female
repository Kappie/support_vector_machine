One real sentence.  Or three.  These are mine.  Tonight was a dark night.  That's all I'll say.  Forming behind a sordid tongue Slithering out the mouth and staining the chin Groping their way across the filthy smog and smoke Puncturing my eardrums but not directly Using another to relay your accursed song Cowering in agony, as shrill shrieks resonate Breaking all ties, shattering my glass Causing casual destruction with one simple dirty phrase.
