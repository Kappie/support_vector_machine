I either probe too much or concentrate on the story too much.  I never would've thought person-centered therapy would be so difficult.  For all of us who had Van Wyatt as a professor, well apparantly he taught us wrong.  It's really hard staying totally with the client, not giving advice, not probing, and being able to understand them completely.  Just summing up the client, elaborating, or saying you feel scared is just not enough. Hopefully I'll figure this all out in the next few days as I'd like to pass the class.  Becoming a psychologist is not that easy! Wish me luck.
