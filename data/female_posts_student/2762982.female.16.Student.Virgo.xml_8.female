I don't want to hurt anyone...physically or emotionally on purpose.  Srry if it happens on accident.  I don't want to hear the lies, I don't want to be shielded from the truth.  I don't want this pile of problems...but I don't want a clean slate.  She needs to know something is going to happen.  He needs to figure out what it is.  They need to decide where THEY want to go, before I can get involved.  I'm not going to share secrets, but I might just be the one to push them together and talk.  I don't want to be in the middle...that where I deffinitly don't need to be, but I don't want to be completely on the sidelines.  That's what I need to do.  I need to figure out what I want and where I want to be.  Do I want a relationship...fling...friendship?  I don't know...honestly to god I wish I didn't have so many issues with myself and with others.
