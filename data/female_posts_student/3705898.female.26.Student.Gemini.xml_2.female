His description of the zoo and all the animals is so vivid and brilliant, the picture he paints of Pondicherry so colorful and the way that he finds so many distinctive and vibrant characters in the middle of a cold, pale and meaningless ocean is simply unforgettable.  In his own subtle way Martel reminds you that there is a God up there, in any form or avatar you seek him. He doesn't throw religion at your face but makes you look through the eyes of a teenage boy who is trying to discover his faith. He does find that that faith and combined with his willpower to live, he survives to tell his tale.
