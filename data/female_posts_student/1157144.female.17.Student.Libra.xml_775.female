We're definately still going to be friends - we both still want to hang out with each other, and we don't want this to end ugly. It's really great that we've both come to an understanding and whatnot. I hurt a lot, obviously, because I honestly love Neal very much, and had planned on spending the rest of my life with him - I had never felt this comfortable with someone before, and it all seemed so perfect. But I guess it was a little too perfect, and karma had to come around and get me. But like I've been telling other people - sometimes you have to take life up the ass. So I'm gonna take life up the ass and like it. Neal had asked if I still wanted to continue it out for the rest of the year, and just not continue a relationship afterwards, but I said that I wouldn't be able to do that, and so he said that that was fine. And yeah...forgive me if I break out crying sometimes tomorrow, but I'll try not to. Honestly, I'm very glad that Neal got everything out into the open. And now I just need to move on. I'm just glad it all worked out so well, and I appreciate the time that I got to spend with Neal, even though it was short. And yeah..I don't know what else to say.
