But in all honesty, there is some good stuff there that is more in my price range. Leah and I went to a two thrift stores today, Good Will and Unique Thrift Store. She found some great stuff in good condition and it was even name brand items.  I was kinda jealous, cause the stuff she bought was cute. She did buy me some toe socks though which I am gonna cut the toes out and make arm cover thingys.  She found two pairs of capris and a nice shirt. We did find some cute skirts for church, but they had some holes which was a bummer. But the only probably there is the people speak Spanish over the microphone thing.Ugh, that also is another blog, some other time. GO BACK TO MEXICO!      Moving on, today was a good Monday. I woke up at a reasonable time. I had some errands I needed to run and I got them done. My parents were going to go up  to Noblesville to take a couch to my grandma's. Since they were doing that I was going to have Leah take me out to Khols. Yes, Khols is a store I shop at often. Anywho, she agreed to take me. But did she really have a choice? So after my parents left we headed off to Khols. We picked up what I wanted at Khols and then walked to A.J. Wright and Dots. Just looked around at some stuff. After that is when we headed to the thrift stores, and you all know how that went. We did manage to eat some Wendy's at the sickest Wendy's I have ever seen. Ugh, someone needs to clean the place. I hate it when someone working there has there friends in there too. Cause then they get distracted and don't do their job. I just had root beer and fries. No way was I going to trust them to make my hamburger. I was even caution about getting ketchup cause coke was all spilled,pickles were on the floor, napkins everywhere, straws all out of the wrappers. Disgusting. One customer came in and he said that he would have someone clean up the mess for me. I was like thank you. But he either didn't mention it to them or they just didn't listen. At least he was being thoughtful, I guess. Well, after all of that, we came home and the parents weren't home yet. But just about 5 minutes later they showed up. We carried some stuff they got to the cottage and decided to go out to eat. I was like ok, I only had fries anyway. But I am not trying to eat so much. So today was a bad day in that area. We went to Max and Erma's. I had cheese fries and some Rasberry Tea. Today was just a fries kinda day. It was delicious and the tea was awesome. I had like 5 glasses. I better wear my Good Nights tonight or my Depends. Hahaha, it's a joke ya'll. I can control my bladder.   Then when the meal was over we came back home. Leah asked me to rearrange her room with her. I helped alittle bit. But that is alot of work. Finally, I wanted to take a break which leaves me to sitting here.      Ok, this was a complaining kind of blog. I let out a bit about my dislike toward Mexicans and then I complained of how the Wendy's was dirty. Is that so wrong? I think not. I did put in a good word for thrift stores..hehe. Well, I think it is time for a restroom break, so I am outtie!      Music Playin' in The Background:  Dare You to Move- Switchfoot
