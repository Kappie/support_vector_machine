Recently, one of my former students and also good friend, Yasi, had these up on her away message and my inner dork just couldn't resist. Now THIS is how molecular biology oughta be taught. Isn't it cuuuute?  PRIMER TO TEMPLATE: "HEY BABY DOES THAT POLYMERASE GO ALL THE WAY"   RNA POLYMERASE: "C'MON BABY LET'S KEEP GOING"  mRNA: "I TOLD YOU UAA MEANS UAA!!!"   A-HELIX: "HEY BABY WANT TO ANNEAL?"  B-HELIX: "GET LOST! I TOLD YOU I DON'T TURN THAT WAY!!"  DNA STRAND 1: "HEY BABY WANT TO LIGATE? OUR STICKY ENDS WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER"  DNA STRAND 2: "KEEP YOUR STICKY END TO YOURSELF OR THE NEXT LIGATION YOU PERFORM WILL BE BLUNT ENDED!"
