It was soo cold out and we marched for almost an hour...and I made the mistake of wearing flip flops. And the circles...suck! Yeah...so we marched and went through the music and thats about it. We get to do the same tomorrow night. Its crazy how small our band is now. I didnt realize how many seniors we had last year. And after this year...its gonna mainly be my class cuz theres not to many Juniors. Crazy stuff...So yeah today I didnt do to much...my day went by tho. Went to church for awhile...messed around...hung with Jon for awhile...and yeah thats about it. Tomorrow I get to clean the house and go and talk to Evie about some stuff. And then it'll be Friday! Yay! So I probably wont write till Monday or w/e...Im sooo excited...and sooo happy! :-D I love you Arik! Can't wait to see you!!!  -Tara
