I wont have any trouble trying to pick music tomorrow. Haha. YaY! But, I'm kind of dreading the car ride. Blah. I've never liked car rides that much. Sometimes I do. Actually, come to think of it, they're ok. Haha. Usually I just sleep or read. Problem is, I have trouble reading in the car, because I can't just focus on the page, I see everything going by me so fast on the side, and my stomach starts to go blah. Ah well, I'll sleep, and listen to the music Alex gave me. That rocks so much. I love him! haha.   Hmmm, I'm trying to decide what to do between all my loads of laundry. I might just read or something, but eh. I  don't have to clean really...for once in my life, my room is semi-clean. Haha, I want it to be too, since we're having neighbors watch our dogs and cat, and...eh, I'd rather my neighbors think I'm a clean psycho girl, instead of a messy one.   Hmmm, I wonder if my phone has outrageous roaming charges. Probably. I'll probably just ask if I can use my mom's phone card to call a few people. Who knows though? I'll hopefully be having so much fun....well, I want to miss my friends, but it is only a week.    Hmmmm, I don't think I really want to play video games, oooo, the Sims! The Sims ALWAYS makes time go by really fast. Wheee. I love them. It's so cute. Tra la la. I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore, so I'm just going to stop typing...
