I got to chill with Chris and hang out over there for a while. Then I spent time with Denise and talked to her about my problems. *will talk about them at a later date* Saturday I drove with Ted. WOW, that was an experience. I drove on the expressway, downtown atlanta, and I have never done that. Today I drove with him again and parallel parked and backed into a parking space. That may not sound like much, but i broke down in the car. He was yelling at me. But, I passed. Which is sooo good. So then I went to my mom's house. And then to Wanda's house. Me and Chris hung out for a couple of hours and did crossword puzzles. *haha, brother!* Dont ask, inside jokes. But yeah, he is really cool and fun to hang out with. Tomorrow I have a counseling appointment and then I'm going to get my hair highlighted and trimmed up beofre school starts. So yeah, thats about it. It's about 15 minutes until midnight. I think I might shut it down for the night and read the books I have. It's about astrology and its awesome. *thanks karane* So yeah, ttyl.
