No, correction, I have the King Kong of headaches, you know, bad enough to make you sick to your stomach or something... only we've gone beyond sick to your stomach pain and moved on to my sanity screaming    "Let me Out! Let me Out! Let me Out!"    and I've tried everything under the sun and beyond to make it go away without resorting to painkillers (because I try very hard not to become dependant on them...) and I failed... miserably... in fact I'm pretty sure I've surpassed the recommended daily dosage for these things.... but I don't care...  My Trig exam has been pushed BACK AGAIN. Thats the third time...... now why am I complaining?... hah.. i don't know.... I'll just shut up about that.. maybe she'll forget I even need to take it. Conics exam on Thursday though, aaaand a WW2 common.... and.............     - -I'm broken when I'm open, and I don't feel like I am strong enough, 'cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome, and I don't feel right when you're gone away- -     OW... okay... this headache is going to make me jump off a bridge soon...  Certainly not least (and without trying to be depressing), I'd just like to put in here a request for everyone to spend a couple minutes remembering the victims of the Holocaust which anniversary is today.... and as well for the students of Colombine... (I believe is tomorrow or Wednesday?). Thanks guys.
