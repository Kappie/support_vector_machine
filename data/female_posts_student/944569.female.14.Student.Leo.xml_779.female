I swear its true! I no lie. They have this great house...And they live on the water so they have a boat and a jetski..I never went on it though..I went on the boat once a long time ago..It was mucho fun.2nd of all...we went to Manhattan..OoOhh pretty lights..We went to Times Square..Planet Hollywood..I've always wanted to go there..Now I did....Its a great place...Although it was great fun..I still complain about my flight. Behold:  Our flight was delayed..It was supposed to be at 7:55p.m then it was moved to 8:45..So we boarded on the plane and literally 2 hours later...We took off..We had to take off that late just because of th stupid..Screw weather..
