CUC stands for Canadian Unitarian Council....Each year they have an AGM, Annual General Meeting somewhere in Canada. And there's a huge youth program that is a a part of it, called CanUUdle (which is the BEST!), which means spooning in Britian :D  I have to go run around screaming now, I haven't been this happy in like...months. Seriously :) Not to this degree :D  *runs around dancing, singing, screaming*
