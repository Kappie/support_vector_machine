I just remembered about the blue moon coming up this year, i can't wait. unfortunately it is on a Monday so i can't celebrate it with my pagan friends :( Oh well maybe next time. oh that reminds me, there is this great pagan Comic strip online that everyone should read and vote for : Oh my Gods - ohmygods.timerift.net  Rhedyn "Nevermore"
