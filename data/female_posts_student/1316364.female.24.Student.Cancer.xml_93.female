Today my stress involved a 40-minute hold on the phone with little company called Quest Diagnostics involving me and a bill for the wonderful amount of $53.25. I know that you are all wondering what the big idea regarding this bill is, well the plain and simple fact of the matter is that I shouldn’t be receiving bill at all, beings that I am a member of Tricare Prime, all of my medical expenses are free, which is the least the government can do for the families of Active Duty military personnel. So you can imagine my surprise when I received this bill for $53.25. Well after 40-minutes someone finally picked up my call and after explaining what I had been told by Tricare, whom I was on the phone for 20+ minutes with before the 40-minute Quest call, I come to learn that what I was told by Tricare contradicted what Quest had to say. So more confused then I was before the wonderful lady at Quest Diagnostics insured me that I would not be charged for the said amount and that they would go ahead and resubmit the charge to Tricare to see if they would clear the cost and if I received another invoice from Quest to go ahead and call them back and they would deal with the situation. She understood that I had no co-pay therefore I need not to pay this invoice. Lets just hope that this gets solved in a timely manner.  The next thing I had to deal with today, also a medical insurance matter, involved a silly little mix up regarding my birthday with my husband’s. It seems that every time I go to fill a prescription from my Doctor’s office there is some sort of hold up at the pharmacy due to the fact that my Doctor’s office gives them my birthday but the medical insurance shows my husbands birthday as mine. So I had to call 3, yes three numbers to get this fixed. The first two were Tricare and TricareWest. Tricare told me that TricaeWest handles this now and to update the info with them. When I called TricareWest they said to contact this company called Express Script, after 25 minutes on the phone with them they are now telling me to call DEERS, but that they are closed for the day and to call them tomorrow… good lord all of this over a mistake in birth dates.   I am beginning to wonder why some people have to make life so hard.
