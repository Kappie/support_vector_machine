Anyway, actually interesting stuff today.  I asked my mom if I could go to Lisa's house on Saturday from 2-8pm to 1) watch The Terminal 2) bake something 3) play ping pong 4) watch Spirited Away and 5) cook ourselves dinner.  I asked her while she was in the shower today while I was scrubbing her back for her, so she was in a relatively good mood.  Her first reaction was, of course, "For fun or for study?"  And since I NEVER lie, I said, "For fun."  Then she said, "For six hours?!"  And I was like, "Yeah..."  Shifty look here.  Then I tacked on, "I'll wash the dishes right now!"  And she conceded.  =))))))  Then later tonight she was like, "So who else is going to Lisa's house?  Surely not just you, right?"  And I said, of course, being ever so truthful as I am, that no, Jack was going, too.  And that was my big mistake.  My mom gave this really scary laugh, and said, "Ah ha!  So that's why you want to go.  This is a meeting with Jack!"  Then I said, "Mom, if this was really a meeting with Jack, I wouldn't have told you he was going..."  But she didn't listen (or the words just went in one ear and out the other), and she kept ranting about how I liked Jack.  It's scary how well my mom knows me, I think.  But now I am so ooover him and I can tell her truthfully that she is off her rocker.  =D  Wow, that was some fast typing there.  Even ignored all the flashy AIM buttons.  I'm so proud of myself.  For the record, this post was started (as in I typed in the title) at 11.51 pm and it is now 11.57 pm.  Six minutes!  Not bad.
