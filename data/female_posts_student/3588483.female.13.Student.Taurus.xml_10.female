There weren't any pic's, so I couldnt put it here. But I was  50% Tidus , 20% Auron(whattaheck?),20%Kimahri(Arh?O.o;) 10%Wakka (bwuhu) and with a round  zero percent  I was  Seymour ! X) Oh well g'day to you all ( if there is any of you who actually has ever seen this sad excuse for a blog of mine ) I shall go to read some oh so lovely hanazakari no kimitachi e and play FFX through the  VERY  annoying Yuna/Tidus makeout scene. (I hate that part of the game!) urh.
