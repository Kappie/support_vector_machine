Today I babysat Mr. Bill's awsome kids and tomorrow i'm babysitting Pam and Amy's kids, then Mr. Bill's kids again. On Wed. it's Mr. Bill's kids again, and then on Saturday i'm babysitting Amy's kids. I mean holy cow. Oh well, I've gotta' do it because I need the money. Yeah, I owe IHS $150 for books I never lost. Go figure. Then on Thurs. and Fri. i've gotta be @ IHS from 9-4. We don't even get to leave for lunch. Then on Sunday I leave for Denver, CO. to see my cousins and family out there. It's just me and my brother flying so this should be fun. Everyone from church is in Virginia, and I wish I could be there too, but I can't b/c I went to Kure instead. That was a mistake, but I guess it's for the best, because i'd be one of like 5 girls on the trip, a few i cannot stand for a week. Amez is at L-ridge too.   So everyone gets back on like the day I leave for Denver. Talk about coincidence. Then I come back on the 8th, and it's so shitty, I might not even be able to make it to the picutre/video thing at Mr. Bill's that day. If i can't make it i will be permamently pissed at my Dad for making me even go to Denver. Allright, enough of my complaining (even though it's my journal so i can complain all i want :).   I found a cool quote in my gay ass summer reading book, cry the beloved country. Here it goes: *Because when a man loves, he seeks no power, therefore he has power* I thought that was cool.  Then there's my other new fave from the movie Bourne Supremacy (awsome movie, go see it): *You're in a deep puddle of shit, and you don't have the shoes for it!* Another awsome quote.  So it really sucks that everyone is gone and i'm here all alone, babysitting. and then i leave. when everyone comes back. No lie, like everyone and their mother is gone this week. I'm being punished for something I guess. Allright I g2g to bed. watching kids wears u out. Later.-  Liz
