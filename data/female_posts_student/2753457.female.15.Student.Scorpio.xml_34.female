Hell, even my mom was singing "Hey ya" in the car today. Hahaha, I had a funny dream last night.  I was watching The Real World at like 10 before I went to bed for some reason.  And when I went to bed I dreamed that I was part of The Real World.  I don't remember all that much, but the commentaries were funny.  I think there were some other people from Enloe there too.  And there was drama.  Actually, I was surprised at the shortage of drama in the current season of Real World, at least from what I could tell from like two episodes last night.  Anyway, watching it took me back to about the fifth grade.  It might have been even further back than that.  Back when the twins used to watch some MTV, and it must have been before they deemed it uncool officially.  It really has not changed much. I need to get my act together tonight.  At least read some Jane Eyre.  I'll try to care. I have had a good last couple of days.  It's just been a second semester so far in general for me.  There's definitely been a few times that were not fun.  But I think I may actually be sorry to see freshman year go. I'm so excited about spring break though!  I think it will be fun.  Even if we can't really drink--HAHA.  Wow, there was definitely some talk among the parents about that.  Hanna, I'm sorry if there was any kind of drama from that.  As usual, my parents had absolutely no idea; they were as out of it as ever.  Would we have really done it anyway?
