AMAZINGLY OUTSTANDING! it was the best i've ever seen. anywho it was really awesome and im just going to get to the point.  SKIP JACKSON  was  UNSTOPPABLE!  so he did good at the qualifying thing last nite he started in the  A-FEATURE  which is the main race. he was  DEAD LAST  in the line-up. there were some crashes, some people ran out of fuel etc...nothing to bad though there were only a couple restarts then we got down to the last two laps. its was so tense.  SKIP  was right there racing w/  DANNY LASOSKI  who is awesome by the way i love him too anywho skip didnt win but in my book he won b/c heres the thing ok the first place driver, mark kinser well they have to weigh the car to make sure he could win and he was  UNDERWEIGHT!  ha....and before that was announced skip came in  4TH PLACE!  but after that being announced skip came in   3RD PLACE  . so last nite he went from   DEAD LAST   to  a   3RD PLACE finish  . you had to be there...congratulations to my favorite driver!
