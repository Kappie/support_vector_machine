That doesn't mean much though, because usually it is already about 80 some odd degrees...which it isn't.  I haven't seen my dear Mathew for a week...It's horrible, I don't like this game. And he will be gone for another 5 days. Woo-hoo! [/sarcasm] I miss Mathew horribly. I'll be alright though. What I really need to do is go out and do something because all I am doing is either working or hanging out in my room doing nothing but watching TV. That isn't very healthy. I need to get out and do something. (I think if I keep telling myself this then I will actually go and do something, but I don't know how effective that is going to be.) I don't know what to do withmyself, I'm being pathetic. I think I'll go read my book and think about how pathetic I am. Works for me.  Fucking Kangaroos. *scribbles them out*  Ciao~
