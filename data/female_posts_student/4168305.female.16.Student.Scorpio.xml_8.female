Okay, that was a little dramatic. The main reason I've created this is because I have nothing better to do with my sad little life. Past journals/diarys have been scrapped, so let's see how long this 'blog' will last!  Right now I'm feeling a little tired and drowsy, also feeling my period pains start to kick in! Only another five days of mind numbing pain to go...  Also only 18 days to go until I get my GCSE results - All  A* 's, no doubt! I'm shitting myself at the thought of opening a large brown envelope and having a big blaring fat  F  stare back defiantly at me, proving that I really am a typical blonde.  *Crosses fingers*   I'm guessing all my innermost thoughts are 'supposed' to be on here, but I'd better be careful what I say in case anyone I know reads this... There's nothing really interesting about my life, I do sod all to be honest.  I've been sat at home for the past three months after completing my GCSE exams. I've not been out of my house much except to go to a crappy Summer School and to stay over at friends houses and go shopping.  The only highlight of my summer holidays has been meeting someone I'm  madly in love  with online. Wonder if I should name him? It went horribly wrong at first, not at all how I expected it to be. Things soon picked up when we were alone though. I don't suppose he'd appreciate me posting what we got up to, even though I'm tempted to write down all the details so I never forget. Sad, aren't I?  After meeting him my thoughts and feelings were all over the place. I am still in love with him, although my feelings of wanting him have intensified a lot more and I hate not being with him. He is hopefully moving to the city I live in to go to university, instead of being 200 odd miles away from me, getting up to God knows what.  I'm gonna be honest now and say I think I'm horrible to him more than I should be. He lets me get away with a lot of things and I think I take advantage a little bit. I don't mean to be nasty to him most of the time, I just get frustrated with him and act like a bitch. He's not left me over one of my moods yet, thank God. Not sure what I would do without him when I think hard about it.  I know I will never meet someone else like him if I lose him.  Anyway I think I'm going on a bit too much about him.  *Blush*  I don't really have much else to say, other than it's really hot and I don't think I'm gonna sleep well tonight.  I'll write something more about myself later on, but for now I'll leave whoever finds this guessing about me...
