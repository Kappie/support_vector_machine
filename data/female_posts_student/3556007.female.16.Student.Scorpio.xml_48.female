We went to see Anchorman tonight, and we watched the whole movie which I enjoyed a lot. Making out at the movies is fun, but I think that it is more fun to actually watch. I mean, you paid for it, right? I was just leaning my head on his shoulder, and he held my hand. Talk about content. :)  Then we went to Sonic, and I thought that I saw the guy that I turned down for homecoming. When we went back to my house, he went to kiss me goodbye... and it didn't stop... I was nervous that my dad was going to look out the window (Brian's windows are tinted but I was still scared) , so we went over to the Beck parking lot for a bit. I just laid in his arms in the back of his car for like 30 minutes, and he is going to be in so much trouble because he was so completely late to come back home.  And OMG he said that he loved me. I don't know how seriously to take it because after I talked to Cassie she didn't seem so thrilled. I think that he was serious, but I don't know. All that I know is that tonight was... magical... There is no other word.  OMG I am so in love with this boy. Help me! Help me!
