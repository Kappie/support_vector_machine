Am I excited for school and that sort of getting older freedom that comes with it? Or am I dreading it and the bitchy people, bitchy teachers and shitty homework? I think it's a little of both. I am quite excited about the whole social acpect of school but I really, really would rather not have to work. What about sleeping in? I will have to get up at 5 in the goddamn morning to get a ride into town. This year I will have to take the bus due to the fact I will no longer be going to a school close to Brendens which destroys my chance of hitching a ride with him. I guess thats life and life sucks. Most of the time anyways.  -Bailey-
