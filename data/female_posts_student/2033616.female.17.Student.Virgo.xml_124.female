Geoff has a snippet about me on his blog, he said.   Believe-Elizabeth Leslie: I have known Elizabeth for quite some time. She is a constant reminder for me to always remember WWJD and stay righteous.   I like that part... I don't really understand this part.   She needs to work harder on that.     Geoffrey, do explain!  Last night I had a bunch of people over.  Chad, Mateja, Jason, Neubie, Whitni, Adam, Mike, Kara, Kayli, Hilary, Laura, Jamie, Lindsey, Aris... All came over.  It was my goodbye to my seniors.  Speaking of goodbye... I've never done it before, and it's hard.  Chad and I recorded his song today.  I was there for about an hour and a half.  I've been doing fine for the last week, but when I left it hit me that that  was  my goodbye. That was hard.  I wasn't planning on working this summer.. But now I have a job.  For a whole two weeks!!!  The YWCA is going to pay me to counsel a day camp for 3-5 year olds.  I went in today to file paperwork.  Those kids are just adorable.  I love kids.  Laura and I decided that when I become everyone's favorite youth pastor I will start a children's choir.  "New Goal, New Goal!!!" oh fun stuff.  I have a date for next year's prom.  Date? Lizzie? Never.  Yes, Jason sure is a sweetheart.    I've lost a little over 17 lbs since March.  It's so strange that I thought this would be the most tedious, gruelling process... But I don't even think about it anymore.    I've already decided that next year I will become a floater at school.  You won't even remember me b/c I will just blend into the background.  I think it'll be easier that way.  I'll just drift.. It'll be fun.  No more drama, zero zero zero drama.  I wish it was summer always and forever.
