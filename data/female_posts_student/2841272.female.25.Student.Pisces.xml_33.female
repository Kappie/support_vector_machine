At first glance this comic book adaptation is truly gripping, taking time to establish the hero's happy domestic life before the bad guys take it all away. This is something that very few action movies do, it creates a foundation of anger and injustice to build off of. But everything after that is anti-climactic, a problem that director and co-writer Jonathan Hensleigh(the writer of   Armageddon   and   The Rock  ) attempts to solve by jacking up the violence in order to keep the audience in their seats.  Thomas Jane stars as Frank Castle, an undercover FBI agent who accidently killed the youngest son of a Tampa Bay crime lord in a arms dealing sting. When Howard Saint, played by John Travolta, discovers Castle's role in his son's death he orders his whole family to be massacred. Somehow, the wounded Castle escapes the family reunion turned slaughterhouse, recovers his health, moves into a rundown section of Tampa, and begins exacting his revenge on those responsible for the murder of his family.  The bright spot in this movie would have to be it's star Jane, who i felt held the screen nicely in his first headlining role. Jane plays the punisher as a grave, brooding vengeance machine, who stays in abtastic shape despite his daily bottle of wild turkey. Jane was even given some comic moments, having strung up a Saint insider for a torture session, the Punisher sears a steak on the stove as he pokes the criminal with a Popsicle. And convinces the sucker that it is actually his flesh burning.  Bottom line, first time director Jonathan Hensleigh neither makes anything interesting, original or profound out of the vigilante premise and doesn't stop Travolta from outrageously hamming up his every scene. The most important element to any action movie is the final fight, in which there must be some build up, ie. some nameless henchmen meet their demise, but then a big last fight with the big baddie, in which you receive closure. Bad guy dead, good guy wins. One more side note on this movie, though it may be true to its comic source, the film really pushes the envelope with its torture and sadism. Such things can be used in movies, but they need to be used properly, they don't need to be there -- just to be there.   Grade: C-   Nick Jensen
