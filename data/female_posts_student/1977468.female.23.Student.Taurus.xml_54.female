Writing this feels premature as I am first creating my material before I write the book (I.e launguistics technology politics history culture warfare ect) but I've been brainstorming heavily the last 2 days. I have a Glossary of Terms, a plot Outline of all 3 books, a Timeline, and 2 seperate papers im working on describing everything there is to know about Valentis, Corrcan and the Serephi. This plot is 2.5 times more complicated then anything simular, and while that doesn't nessisarily mean that the plot is gppd... it actaully is good. It's very good. But I can't tell you :p  "The Dominion Nomanatti was the greatest of all strengths in the Beforetimes. The expanse of their reign knew only the limitations of greed, unquencable in it's yearnings and betraying in it's forfillment. Such was The Dominion's demise. As is written in the Books of Chronology, the first galactic government was the last. Not one among the Dominon of a Thousand Systems foresaw the colapse, not one would prepare for the Age of Forlorn which followed. The one flame of glory which had taken countless generations to kindle had smouldered, and all those who basked in it's warmeth were left forever bleak in the vast oblivion. 	Thus ended the Era of Grand Hemegony, and what lead after noone can say in right authority. The supply ships stopped coming. Systems like ours, systems like Valentis must have been numerous. Many suffered the hollowness of mouth. Like an infant lost of a mother's milk, so we fought to tame the soil in the weakest of states. Not since has their been such pain. The planet beneath us pruned our people, and in it we found our lives renewed. Eons have passed since the Age of Forlorn, but eons have no hold on the affairs of men. Different agendas, different names and people, but war is and will always be the same. 	It is no suprise then to find ourselves on the verge of a great war, the war of our Dynasty, the war of one victor It is because of our past that we push forward so boldly, into what we call a great smelting. A purification. It is because of our future we fan the furnice, for whomever holds the virgin system of Udarious will be ensured much gain. 	The inner systems have progress, the churning of industry and the science of life giving. Valentis has nothing. It had always been there above us, somewhere, as an overlooked key into the circle of the thriving. We detected the ore by mistake. Mass quantities of it, enough to mine for generations, and sell for fortunes. Our probe had been misguided on a mission of dicovery towards the void when we passed the planet.. Our first recon ship has been sent, but it's departure has been made known to Corrcan, the nearest surviving planet to us. What is known of Corrcan dictates that they have not faired as well from the eons past. They are reckless in their desperate measures, but their recklessness makes them unpredictable and therefor dangerous. Corrcan has sent their own ships."  I agree it needs some work, but I have a looooonngg time for that :/
