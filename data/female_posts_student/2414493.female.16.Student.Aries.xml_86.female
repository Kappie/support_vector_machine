MUSINGS: Without a doubt, there are some things I wouldn't trust anyone with. And then there are people I would trust with just about anything, and then people who I trust less. I grin when I say I'd like to think I have friends. But do I censor myself too much? Is it terrible to categorize friends? S and E are of the idea that it is, and they do have a point. But then again, they're different people. C doesn't think it really matters. I don't know, I was always of the idea that people appreciated listeners too, but now they're looking for talkers?  For some reason, my mind has the idea that I need to put things in print in order for them to have more structure, more filling to them, but then again I must be careful. The upside to blogging is that it's faster and neater (better than journals written while propped up on pillows), but then again, it's for an audience. But the downside is that exposure has gotten out of hand. I don't mind people reading it who don't live in the area, and I don't mind telling people who I would probably tell all to anyways, but once the audience grows you start keeping things out.  So yes. Maybe I should start keeping journals again?  I don't know whether or not to tell people about Harvard over the summer. Frankly, I'm excited as ever but it just implies ivy league and snobbiness and moneyed people and snotty intellectual superiority. I just don't want to say it and have TC types think that's just stuck-up and rude, which it isn't, in my humble opinion.  I actually don't have that much homework. So I'm going to look up plane tickets. Hah.  In the end, it's all about perspective. I talk to some people and they can make me feel completely guilty and have me pledge reform and give up my pride (unyielding, as always, and I don't see how that's a bad thing, but I have a thick skull), and then I talk to others who are just ambivalent and tell me hey, you're fine! and there are some others where it's just like, ugh, I can't stand it, you should realize that there's this and this and this wrong with that. I know ultimately I choose for myself. It's no burden, but it entails careful contemplation.  How do I fight for independence and find out that everything leads back to relationships with people?  T pointed this out for me today--I'm glad Dad's the person he is. He'll be the one to take me driving when both Mom and Grandma think I'll do something dangerous, he'll be the one to take me to get that scarf and that dress, and he'll nudge me in the direction of growing up despite being fundamentally Asian about other things too. And he's letting me go and says his old (and I say this in the best of ways) Jewish consultant can pick me up at the airport in Boston. I smile when I think about this: this man lives in the Boston 'burbs, is married but has no children, talks about education (he apparently did well in school) and said something about taking people to New Brunswick, where the people are backward. HOW COOL IS THAT? and best of all, he's coming to California in a matter of weeks. (Dad says he's afraid to show him our house because his consultant's is impeccably clean, while ours is...lived in, let's say.)  And happy I'm here. I'm happy I can look forward to the end of June (eight weeks! yeah!) and I'm happy I can have fun planning it. I'm happy I actually got through the Bach double today, I'm happy I showered right after school and it felt awfully good. Yes, I have things to ponder over. I still have to look up cultural leads, and I don't want to do it (pre-start fears?) but I should sooner or later because by tomorrow it will have been a week. I want to go shopping, lol.  So here, Z, is a song in your honor: "It's a beautiful day..."
