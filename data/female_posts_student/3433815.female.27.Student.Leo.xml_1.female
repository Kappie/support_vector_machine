They just keep lying and cheating and believing in their own make believe world. I live in the real world, where you get an education to start a career, find a mate, get married and together make children. If you want to be childish with name calling, fine I can be just as mean: some of your life plans weren't put into that typical order now were they? you know, get married THEN.. (or at least with your girlfriend, you supposedly only love). keep on living it up. are you having fun yet? You push me, what, did you expect me to sit back cry and let you say what you want? I told you before that this was my page and my voice, I didn't use your name or start calling you little names. Or did I use anything too personal, to hurt you. If you don't like what you see, don't look. How many times have you lied and cheated and then cried to me that you were so wrong, I'm the only one you love.. blah blah.. then oh look there you are again, sticking it to another new chicky and lying to me all over again. I wasn't planning on getting mad or acting like a bitch, but you pushed me a lil too far. Some day when someone does everything to you that you have done to me, then you will know what it was like and how much I just sat back and attempted to believe you, as you lied right to my face. yep that's love. HA. and so I felt perfectly fine with what I wrote about my mom, (I have the right to feel anyway about her) but, YOU constantly complained: I needed to vent, so I did. if it helps make you more of a man to "cut me" or call me names, oh well, that just reassures me of you. Anyway it really didn't make any since or have anything to do with the topic, but I guess that makes you feel better about yourself.
