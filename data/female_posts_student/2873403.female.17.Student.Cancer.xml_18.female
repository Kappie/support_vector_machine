So I'm going to sit around and drink apple juice out of a champagne glass and eat some chips. I'm just so amazingly cool like that. *Rolls eyes* Yeah I think I shall also revisit that old love of mine known as the EmoGame.   So here's how my day went so far...Well.. I'm going to start from yesterday... Yesterday I went to school, then practice, yaddy yaddah, I was being lazy so I played defense in the drill we were doing and Mr. C was like, "You were doing good on D, maybe we should move you from 1st home to cover point." and I was like, "Um... I don't know about that..." because I hate playing defense in games. Then varsity had to run hills, so I'm quite grateful for being on JV just for that. Oh yeah I got hit in the head again. Leave it to me to find a way to get hit in the head, even with those retarded cages/ masks/ goggles/ whatever you want to call them that we have to wear. After practice we were taking the bus home and it was me and Courtney and Amy and Daniel Roth and some other random girl that was just kind of there, and we were pretty much sharing my extremely exaggerated sex life with the whole bus. It was awesome, because really, we weren't talking about my sex life. Somehow it just seemed like we were. But its all good. It was some quality entertainment. After that, I went home, ate mac and cheese, then went to bed, even though it was only like 6:30. Then Nick called and we talked till like 10, then I passed out.   This morning, I woke up late, showered, then my sister starting yelling that I had to leave in 2 minutes, so I got out of the shower and got dressed and whatnot as quickly as possible, then went to school, did pretty much nothing all day, then found out we were going home early so then in lunch I found out Erica was not there which kind of made things boring but I was all talking to Jen and Nicole, then Nick came to visit me, and we looked at pictures he drew in his notebook of people dying. It was fun. Then we went home and we were all on the bus and Nick had my leg and he kept hitting my knee... ya know, that whole reflex thing, so then everyone was hitting my knee. Then Nick and Natch were pretending to be Fitty-cent and then I left and stood on my deck in the snow till my sister came home, then I watched Saved By The Bell. And that is all. I was all going to go over to Nick's with Rob but my mom is a waste of life and decided to fall off the face of the earth.
