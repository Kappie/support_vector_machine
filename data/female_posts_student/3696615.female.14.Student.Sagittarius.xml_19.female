You're upper class, and have plenty of money, and yet... you don't work for it. You'd like to rule the world, and yet... you're destroying it.  You love your country and if you could you'd hump it to death, and yet... cause everyone else to hate it.  You claim those who challenge the president are unpatriotic, yet you've never done one patriotic thing in your life.
