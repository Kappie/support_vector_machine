Each one was a different-colored pocket, with a white square that had the day printed in black letters. You were supposed to move the paper that said "today" on each day.  I still remember each color. Monday was blue, a dark blue that i today learned is known as "Klein blue" after a guy who patented the color. Tuesday was orange, Wednesday was green, Thursday was a dark red-burgundy-red, and Friday was yellow. Saturday and Sunday were light purple and pink, I think, but we didn't have school on those days, so they weren't so important, since you didn't get that cool job of moving the paper.  To this day, I associate each day of the five-day school week with that color. We make plans for Tuesday and I envision orange. Etc, etc. Weird, huh?
