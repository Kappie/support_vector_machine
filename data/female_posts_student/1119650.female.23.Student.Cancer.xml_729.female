Seems that the Suites is gettin a classy upgrade.  The inclusion of 26 bottles of wine and two, count 'em, two wine racks to house those bottles provide what the French call a 'Certain I Dont Know What'.  Next thing ya know we will be holding the 1st Annual Hillcrest Suites Wine  Cheese Party.  I can see it now.  Tuxedo's, Dresses....Pinkie out!  Also, the Great Viceroy presented Hank with an awesome birthday present.  Pictures are to follow.  I can not describe it, you just gotta see it.  Aight people.  I am outie like a Saudi.  Enjoy yo weekend!
