How is she? One of the things I hate about being here is that I'm not there to see her when she does get out. Give her a hug for me...or alot of them. Are her parents still keen on not letting you two see each other? How does she feel? Tell me k? Have you heard from Will...has he jumped off a cliff yet? I haven't heard from him except to tell me to multiply by the page number when I didn't know an answer. Smile I'm still alive thought if you want to report to Phil that I'm dead, pregnant, anorexic, psychotic, in love with someone else...I don't care. But smile k? for me? yea I know not huge incentive but I still love you too. Anyway gtg. BYebye
