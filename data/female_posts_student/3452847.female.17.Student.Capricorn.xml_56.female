No stopping him, i should really just forget about him... Going out tonight so maybe i'll pull if i go into the sheep afterwards... Working lots next week and thats about it, probably sunbathing too, be nice, i missed him even though hes not with me, but i guess i always miss him.... A tiny part of me does anyway. Anyway i better go now as i got to have a shower and i'm hot ans sweaty from work which is nice.  ~Lisa~
