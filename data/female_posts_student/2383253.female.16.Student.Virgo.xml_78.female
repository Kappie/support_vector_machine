My favorite quote from your post: "I saw Dodgeball. I almost cried a lot." Now, how  exactly  do you "almost" cry a lot? Explain please? You silly boy.  I am currently looking at my TV screen, and there is a nude man with whipped cream on his two pecs and over his crotch, with two cherries on each nipple. Fascinating.  Anyway, I had a really good day today for a change. Lately I've been bundled up at home because I had my wisdom teeth extracted last Tuesday. The nitrous oxide rocked, the shots sucked, the surgery felt like it only lasted a minute, the feeling when I woke up sucked, I was loopy for quite some time after, the pain was unbearable, the starvation from being limited to only soft foods completely sucked, the vicadin was a miracle, and the swelling made me look like a chipmunk that was punched in the face. All in all, it was a bitch, but I'm almost fully recovered.  Back to today.... So today Insha and I drove out to Encinitas to a consignment shop to see if we could sell a few old items from our closets. I made $21, she made $15. Not bad for crappy clothes we don't wear anymore. Then we drove to Solana Beach and looked around in some hippie shops. Later drove to Golden Spoon, had some delicious ice cream, dropped by Longs, picked up some Propel and ramen. Good times, good times.  I'm gonna go vegetate some more in front of the TV now. More updates later.
