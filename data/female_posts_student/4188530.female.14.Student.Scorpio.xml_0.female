I guess that be another goal... let's see goal number 834. Heh heh. Anyways today was interesting I found out I'm almost getting an A in marching band. Yay! I think I can make it. Oh great now I reminding myself of that train thing. Going on. Umm... I went to the drumline car wash that was interesting cause I stayed with them for most of the time and I got to chill with the pit people lol... Well this may sound a little down, but is it just me or do you get the feeling that everyone gets everything better. I'm pretty sure that's just me but it really kills me. Probably just whinning about it so it's not that important just that. In marching band I'm sort of alone (yeah I know sort of sad) I tried but I guess I don't know it's not natural and I don't want to force people to like me cause they have to deal with me for however long they are there for. Everyone is so nice and that could be just the way they are... You just never know and so I stay with myself alone in my caption. It sucks cause I feel more like an outsider than a fellow brass player. I mean no one has been mean, but I haven't really found someone I can go up and just talk to. They're either in woodwind or percussion... and that sucks. My section is great couldn't ask for a better one, but I get the feeling that they're better off without me. They bond together more, they bond with other freshman more, and I just watch laugh and smile. I wanted to be more unshy this year... I gotten more friends but sometimes I feel like shit. I know it's just me blattering on about  my  feeling but still. Shouldn't you at least be a little happy? That's all folks.
