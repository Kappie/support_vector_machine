Kirby in Nightmare in Dreamland [I know what you're thinking but it's actually a really fun game plus Kirby is sooo CUTE ^^] Megaman Zero [ Very fun game.  Very cool.  I love it.  Except I cant get past the 2nd stage :'(  !!!!  Someone tell me how to beat Aztec Falcon!!!  I already leveled up my weapons to the max but he's still IMPOSSIBLE!!!]  I hope my day in school will be good tomorrow.  I wonder if anyone got a tan or a new haircut.  I know i might soon...
