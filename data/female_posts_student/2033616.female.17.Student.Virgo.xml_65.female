I really hate turning around and realizing the damage i might have done.  So, I'm sorry for being so dramatic and rude.  I am the kind of person who (in most cases) gets mad and inevitably blows up, no matter how long i try to cool off.. it just builds till i get it off my chest.  But by the time I'm done, I've calmed down, become rational, and feel horrible about what I've said.  Oh if i only had a nickel everytime i wanted to take something back.  I just wanted to say, I am not holding a grudge and I'm, again, sorry for what i said.  I just hope that my occaisional irrationality doesn't turn my friends away.  I love you all!!!   P.S. I'M GOING TO SURVIVE AP CHEMISTRY EVERYONE!!!!!! I HAVE A 90%!!!!!!!!
