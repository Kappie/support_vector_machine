Its a true story about this bull rider Lane Frost, And he dies when a bull broke his rib and it stabbed him in the heart.Okay now if that isnt sad enough at the end of the movie they have his partner Tuff Hediamen and Cody ? his family and everybody talking about how he effected thier lives.Yeah i cried lol. Im getting sick i think. Yuck i hate being sick. Coughing is the worst possible thing. It makes you sound like youve been smoking crack since you were two! LOL sorry, but its true. Okay gotta go email Amanda!
