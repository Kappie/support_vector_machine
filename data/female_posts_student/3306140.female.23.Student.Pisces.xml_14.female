My mother does not know but I really don't have the money to pay my bills. My mind is not in to school but I have to act like it is so I can get out. I am have so serious problems with my personal life. Why is it can not find love? I am losing my cool and I am giving up on love. I thought that I had found the one I would be with but he said that he is not interested. Am I not good enough for love? Do I look bad? Or is it that all of the things that I did in the past is catching up with me? What ever it is I can not take much more.
