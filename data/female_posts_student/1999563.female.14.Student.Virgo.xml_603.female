How many is this? Number 4,001? At worldview they told us how over 4,000 "corections" have been made to the Book of Mormon. It makes me so sad that the people involved in Mormonism don't realize how false there religion is. I mean really. I would hate to be a Mormon girl. Your husband like rules your life. When he dies, and if he lived a good enough life, he choses wether to take you to his planet or not. Geez.   It seems like all the other religions in this world, beside Christianity, live with the idea that YOU have to be good enough to get into heaven. You have to do this, you have to do that. But really, God is the only way we can ever hope to get into heaven. It isn't based on anything we ever did or will be able to do. God just loves us.  What an amazing guy. I can only hope to be a fragment of what he is. I want to be good like Jesus, but alas, I am a rotten person and I will never be like Jesus. But the reason Jesus came wasn't to be like "Hah! I didn't sin! But your a sinner, YOUR GOING TO BURN IN HELL!" He came for ME!  And youuuuu!!   Well...  yeah.  Hahah I just go on these huge rants and I can't stop typing but then I just run out of things to say.  Casting Crowns - Who Am I From the album Casting Crowns   Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth Would care to know my name Would care to feel my hurt Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star Would choose to light the way For my ever wandering heart  Not because of who I am But because of what You've done Not because of what I've done But because of who You're   Chorus: I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the ocean A vapor in the wind Still You hear me when I'm calling Lord, You catch me when I'm falling And You've told me who I am I am Yours, I am Yours  Who Am I, that the eyes that see my sin Would look on me with love and watch me rise again Who Am I, that the voice that calmed the sea Would call out through the rain And calm the storm in me  I am Yours Whom shall I fear Whom shall I fear 'Cause I am Yours I am Yours  It just seems SO amazing that I am this microscopic dot in the universe and God choose to care about me. he knows my NAME!   I thought it was amazing when Trish [the lead singer of Superchic[k] ] would call me by name at concerts. But, get this, the king of the universe knows my name!!! that's like George bush knowing everyone in this countries name.  Acctually, it's way more amazing than that.  It's like presdent bush knowing everyone in this country by name and being best friends with everyone.  It's even more amazing that that!!  God knows every who has EVER lived on this earth. And he doens't even just know our names, he knows everything about us. He knows everything we have ever done and he knows everything we will do!  I just can't stop being amazed at that.  Wow!  Matthew 10:30 And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.   He even knows how many hairs I have on my head!!! Hahhaha. I would even know how many hairs i had if I counted for days!!!!  Wow.  GOD ROCKS!!   Wowowoowowow!  Sorry I am having a "God Moment"  Romans 8:38-39 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[1] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.    NOTHING can separate us from Gods love!!!  So, if I moved 3,000 miles away from my best friend and I refused to call her, write her, e-mail her, and have any correspondance with her, wouldn't our friendship end?! I think so!! But God never will leave you. If you be a jerk he wont get all mad and be like "She hurt me, I don't want to talk to her ever again!" GOD LOVES YOU! Haha! No matter how stupid I can get God still loves me and he will always want to be my friend!  Wow is all I can say!     I am surprised you read all this. You just heard all of my meaningless patter. woohoo! Fun stuff...  I better get off to bed! Later gators.
