I came to a good conclusion though. I can't stand hanging out with the girls. They have horrible personalities. All they care bout are 4 things. Talking about each other, Clothes, boys, and gay random things. I almost went spaztic on them tonight, but saekho was there..thats not saying much, but, I didnt want them saying stuff bout her, cause she hangs with me. Evne though I already know they dig on her and shit cause of it. I gotta go, ('rents.)
