I think this is the first time we have ever celebrated it. It will be nice to have the family all here and it is a great opportunity to take pictures of everyone to send to Jesse. My Niece and two Nephews are also coming over and I know any pictures of them Jesse would love to see.   I am also working on a special project to send Jesse, but I can’t say what it is because I know he reads this and I want him to be very surprised (if anyone wants to know please don’t hesitate to ask me via email). I got the idea for my top secret project from one of the other ladies in my FRG and today I went to Wal-Mart to get the supplies. Don’t worry when I am done I will post pictures up of my top-secret project here.
