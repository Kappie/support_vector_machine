I despise CNN and almost every time I flip over to CNN I despise the channel more. I don't hate the newscasters, because they are people and that's just wrong; I simply hate what they do. I hate the way their liberal slant makes my lunch linger in my throat. I hate the way their anti-Bush sentiment makes my blood pressure rise. I hate the way their snide, underhanded leftist remarks motivate me to waste moments of my life writing about them. Nonetheless, I feel the need to vent. That's why I have this blog thing anyway, right?  As anyone who has glanced at the front page of a newspaper today knows, Florida was hit by a devastating hurricane that goes by the name of Charley. Charley was destructive and vicious, leaving a trail of material ruin and sadly, families grieving for their loved ones. Today, the day after the storm, President Bush announced that he would be visiting Florida to survey the destruction and make sure relief workers had all they needed. That's what Presidents do, right?  Then we have CNN's take on the situation. Moments ago, a CNN newscaster made this statement:     "This President usually doesn't go to disaster areas. With an election only 79 days away, one must wonder if politics are involved."     CNN followed up this gem by showing John Kerry throwing a football (and looking a bit on the queer side) with an aide and noting his willingness to be supportive of the people of Florida during this time. You know, John Kerry didn't make a statement about natural disasters a year ago. Of course this time, CNN didn't say, "With an election only 79 days away, one must wonder if politics are involved."  The President usually doesn't go to disaster areas? WHAT? This is a president who has been defined by his comfort to people in a time of disaster. This is the man who visited Ground Zero days after the September 11 attacks, stood on a pile of rubble, grabbed a bullhorn and made a promise to the people of New York and the people of America. The archives on CNN's website contains an article stating that President Bush visited the victims of tornadoes in Missouri. Less than a year ago, Bush went to Virginia to inspect hurricane damage and basically do exactly what he is planning to do tomorrow morning. Hmmm...with just over 400 days left before the November 2004 election, one must wonder if politics are involved. Stupidity.  I have sneaking suspicion that CNN would pound the president for any decisions at this point in time. Had Bush decided NOT to go to Florida, what would CNN say? Would they call him cold and uncaring? Out of touch? I suppose we will never know, because as president, George W. Bush is doing his job. Deciding not to visit Florida for fear of having his actions work against him in the election would be like a senator (not that I have anyone in particular in mind) skipping important votes in order to campaign.
