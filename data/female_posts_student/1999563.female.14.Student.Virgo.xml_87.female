I wish I could just stay in bed! Well....here is what I am going to wear today: Skirt with white sweater and hoodie (ya gotta have a hoodie... :D ) On my face I am going to be wearing a You Rebel tinted mousterizer (thats one hard word to spell!) my Benefit Dear John eyeshadow and some concealer...lol. I have major problems, ignore me.  Ooh! I am also going to wear my bluuuueee contacts! *w00t* I love them :D  I feel to sick to live so I think I am going to go take a bunch of random pills. Yuck.  Love, Laura
