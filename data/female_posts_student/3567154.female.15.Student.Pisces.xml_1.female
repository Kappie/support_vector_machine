Which i know they didn't Jake had already told me that she was gonna say that and that it wasn't true. I know if Jake had done anything with her he would have told me cuz i would forgive him. I would only get mad if he tryed to hide it. I know what it feels like to hurt someone by cheating on them and then not have them forgive you. It sucks and I would not do that to Jake ever!!! Besides even if Kristelle had gotten me and Jake to break up He wouldn't have gone out with her. He would be pissed at her for breaking me and him up. I mean come on i already had one person try to break me and Jake up so that he could go out with me (Lame attempt) I mean that is suck a dorky way to get someone to go out with you. I mean come on eventualy they are gonna break up so just wait. O but if u are waiting for me and Jake to break up again FORGET IT!! It ain't happenin. We have already had all our breaks up. We both know we want to be together forever and ever. I love him to much to break up with him again.  Ok nothing fun at all happened today. Pat and Dad are gone to sum retirerment party. I got to stay here. Which is probley a good thing cuz i wouldn't know any of the ppl there neways. Tomorrow Jake is probley taking me home tho. My mom and Dad both said ok. Well accutly my Dad was tryin to paun me off to go home with Jake cuz he had a golf game for tomorrow and his tee-off time is at noon. So yea. I don't know wut we are gonna do. I think mall sounds kinda good too me. Maybe some foodage. I got money this time too YAY. LOL Ok well i am out p34(3 0|_|7
