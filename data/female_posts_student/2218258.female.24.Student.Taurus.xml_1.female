I'm not sure if I can post in the blog as a player.. or if i'm even allowed to post *gasp*.. Also, I apologize if someone ever gets offended by any remark or off-comment I make -- if anyone does, aim me ;) and we'll chat  ok! Well, Kat mentioned that we have a full house :P I was wondering, how can you send invites? I was trying to figure out how to send invites.. But i couldnt do it. So I'm wondering, Kat, can you send an invite to Geoff?  Ah, about the characters. Well, I'm going to be creating a 1-lvl character (just like Kat did). And if anyone ever needs help creating one, feel free to aim me @ fr2nc1z . I personally don't think it would be a good idea to post a how-to-create-a-character in a blog because a lot of it depends on the character and the player. That's why I'm volunteering my time to help ppl out :P hehe. Anyhow, obviously, this would be a decision made by ppl -- and ah, I dont read ppl's minds (even tho it would be the coolest power to have!). So it's up to you guys :)  Oh, and I was also thinking that we could have people comment on a post.. or something.. so we know what everyone is thinking about playing (no point in having 7 rogues - even tho it would be hilarious.... ***gets an idea*** Hey! Maybe I'll be a rogue too!! And then we can ALL be rogues..... no, but seriously... ummm... well, maybe it wouldnt be so bad :P).  Anyhow, those are my 2 cents.. Let me know what you think :)
