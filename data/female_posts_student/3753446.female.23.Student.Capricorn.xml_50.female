I kinda think that I turn into a completely different person around girls. I have to care about stuff like nailpolish and clothes, which I do care about, but not that much. But around guys I can generally be myself, and just, well, not care! And we all have these great no stress relationships that have lasted years in some cases. So I wanted to write something about them. So here it is, for all of you...  The Poem for My Boy Friends.  The sister he never had Always wished for her The brother she'll always miss Still needs him Inseparable teammates  Choose your own adventure (No let me) Make me laugh (With you) Look at those smiles  (Radiate)  Taking life and what it hands them Never too seriously Screaming F U to circumstance Choosing to live, no, LIVE Companions going on, anyway  That is timeless friendship, Brothers and sisters of the world. That is love.
