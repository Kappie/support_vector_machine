It felt like a good, solid day today--at least I don't get couch potato headaches just yet. Woke up at 11, made lunch with Grandma, went to Costco and Michaels for wrapping paper, wrapped 21 boxes of bowls. I think I'm going to do more; there's nothing like wrapping presents, especially when there's 43 of them. I think the only person weirder than me in this sense is the wife of Aaron Spelling, TV producer, who has a room dedicated to wrapping presents. Not like I really care, but a random tidbit. Did some history, not as much as yesterday. There's nothing like sitting in the media room with the curtains wide opening and music blaring. Death Cab for Cutie is good. More room for wuss rock appreciation.  We're taking family pictures tomorrow. Photographer at 2, pictures at 3. I really wonder how they turn out, because I'm really sure Dad's smirk mixed with Austin's cocky grin and my lost stare don't mix together very well. And we wear nothing that matches, not that it really matters in real life.  It's Good Friday today. I didn't even know that. How sad.   Back to work. Austin's trying to tell me a crappy joke and I don't want to hear it. Hi Austin.
