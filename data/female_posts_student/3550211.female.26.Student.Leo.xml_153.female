In the 29 years since then, the pair of unorthodox, streetwise cops and their souped up hot rod Torino have become icons of disco style and violent-but-blood-free American television. Just a few notes of the "wakka-chicka" theme song is enough to transport anybody back to the 1970's.   Lord have mercy on us all.   On the surface, plain-clothes Detectives Starsky and Hutch were like chalk and cheese. Ken Hutchinson (David Soul) opted very much for the quiet life, being well read and deep thinking. Dave Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser), on the other hand, was louder and more brash; enjoying street life.   However, at second glance,  Starsky and Hutch  seems of a piece with  Baretta, The Streets of San Francisco , or even producer Aaron Spelling's own  Charlie's Angels --one more post-1960s police series with street smarts and social cognizance, that expresses at least a passing familiarity with youth culture. Yet on closer inspection, swarthy Dave Starsky and surfer/sensitive Ken Hutchinson, confirmed bachelors and disco-era prettyboys, seem to have taken the cop show maxim "Always watch your partner's back" well past their own private Rubicon.      The series was originally part of a logical progression by Spelling (with and without partner Leonard Goldberg) that traced the thread of the detective drama through the fraying social fabric at the end of the 1960s. Beginning with  The Mod Squad  (cops as hippies), this took him in logical sequence to  The Rookies  (cops as hippie commune),  S.W.A.T.  (cops as hippie commune turned collectivist cell/paramilitary cadre), and finally Charlie's Angels (ex-cops as burgeoning feminists/Manson Family pinups). This was before jettisoning the cop show altogether and simply leaching the raw hedonism out of 1960s liberalism--with  The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Family  (sauteed in hubris), and ultimately, the neo-Sirkian  Beverly Hills 90210 and Melrose Place .  In this context, the freewheeling duo might seem the perfect bisecting point on a straight line between  Adam-12's  Reed and Malloy and  Miami Vice's  Crockett and Tubbs.  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  had ushered in the "buddy film" cycle, just then reaching its culmination with  All the President's Men , and in fact, the pair physically resemble no one so much as the high-gloss Redford and Hoffman assaying the golden boys of broadsheet expose, Woodward and Bernstein.   Yet viewed in retrospect, their bond seems at very least a curious one. Putting aside the ubiquitous costumes and leather, or Starsky's Coca-Cola-striped Ford Torino and Hutch's immense .357 Magnum handgun, which McLuhan or Freud might well have had a field day with, the drama always seems built around the specific gravity of their friendship. There is much of what can only be termed flirting--compliments, mutual admiration, sly winks, sidelong glances, knowing smiles. They are constantly touching each other or indulging in excruciating cheek and banter--or else going "undercover" in various fey disguises. All of the women who pass between them--and their number is considerable, including significant ones from their past--are revealed by the final commercial break as liars or users or criminals or fatal attractions. And should one wind up alone with a woman, the other invariably retreats to a bar and drowns his sorrows. Following the inevitable betrayal, it is not uncommon for the boys to collapse sobbing into each other's arms.  The tone of all this is uniformly playful, almost a parlor game for those in the know (not unlike Dirty Harry, whose most famous sequence--the bank robbery--is bookended on one side by Clint Eastwood biting into a hot dog, and on the other by a fire hydrant ejaculating over the attendant carnage). Meanwhile, the rather generic storylines consistently play fast and loose with gender.   Altogether, a fascinating digression for episodic television--especially considering that it was conducted apparently entirely beneath the pervasive radar of network censors.   To which I have to say: Good For Them.  As for the movie staring Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Snoop Dogg, well, I'll just say that I found it to be amusing. As remakes go, you pretty much know what to expect - gentle humor, a basic plot and a film that is carried by it's laughs and sheer sense of fun.      I think casting Snoop Dogg as Huggy Bear was brilliant. In my opinion, he stole the show. But then again, I'm not only easily amused, but I also happen to be a fan of Snoop. So I don't suggest taking my opinion to heart. Take it for what it is. Crap.  So why am I talking about this now? Because I watched the movie this morning, and evidently, I have nothing better to do with my time then go off on long drawn-out discussions about a show that originated before I was born.   Hmmm. I'm thinking it's time I get off my butt and go outside.  But it's so bright. And sunny.   Then again, maybe I'll drape black sheets over the windows, pop in another DVD, and wait until the sun goes down before I venture out into the world.  It's true. I am a vampire goddess.
