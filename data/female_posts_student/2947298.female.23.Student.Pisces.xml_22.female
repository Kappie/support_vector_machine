Saturday Ross and I worked our asses off all day getting the garden together and then Sunday I did the Easter thing w/ my Dad and Sisters, then dinner with my Mom and John. I took my sister out Saturday for her 13th Birthday Dinner, she's a cheap date. Went to Charlie Brown's and she had fries and the salad bar, no wonder she keeps so thin. But it was fun to talk and do the sister thing. We also made cookies together at 11pm, woke Dad but what ya gonna do, it was fun.   I really do love my sisters so much.  The  garden  looks great, it really is cool working so hard on something and seeing it grow to be something beautiful.  We have LOTS of mint, so much, but a few flowers like Roses and my favorite, Bleeding Hearts. Did a lot of thinking, yes me!, about everything. It may be odd but I act out conversation senarios that will never happen with people I prob will avoid or just not see.  Never works out the way I want to, mostly because I lack the balls to say really mean things or stand up for myself. This usually happens in the shower cuz it is my only alone time and well started because I was always mad at my parents and couldnt very well tell them what I was really thinking.  I came up with this thought, I didn't know I had. Since I talk in my sleep I have these amazing conversations with Ross and I do not remember because they are my dreams I forget by morning. So my  thought  was that life is like a tree. We start small and each experience branches out and becomes more developed or as Ross said I said, "each decision we make leads to another branch, one dies and one grows. what we get is a bit irregular but its  beautiful  when it's done".  I guess I will never really know. And one time after the Matrix Revolutions I sit straight up in bed and say, "I get it, the real reason we all live is to die", and then back down to snoring I go. Silly, I am a deeper thinker in my sleep.   Interesing site . I don't know why people dig these chicks, but they do and well it's sorta disturbing. But Suicide Girls, you can see them at shows, view their blog or make ur own there. It's a good set up for a blog too, but alas the whole ugly  urlLink suicide girls  kinda turns me off.  My theory is find someone without suicidal issues, been there done that, just ends up to you wishing they would actually for once follow through with it. Drama queens the lot of them, and well there's better looking chicks in  urlLink PLAYBOY  and they don't talk back in blogs ;-).    urlLink  OH AND RAMAPO COLLEGE'S SPRING BREAK   it's even got pictures!!! But really you go to spring break far far away in hopes of not meeting people you know and well drinking and partying and we are young so we may or may not have sex. Why though would you do an article so late into spring break? The real ones are the week before! So of course they run into alot of Ramapo students cuz our school has to be gay and let spring break come so late and well our school sucks at schedules. So even when I go on Spring Break I run into every Ramapo student there. But my vacation will be different!  Oh so much boozing there will be! Well I'm beat, and Ross's radio show is over soon, and I'm missing him already! He played N.E.R.D. "she wants to move" for me! "Sometimes I fear we are to cute" "oh shniggle snoop" -futurama
