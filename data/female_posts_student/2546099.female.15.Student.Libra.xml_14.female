We walked sum of the way wit Luke and Kenny, they r kinda odd but neways. Kate and i made a promise not 2 smoke again, but she broke it last nite lol. I didnt get nething 4 valentines day, but mez did! Im worried tho, i pretty sure its real but a part of me thinks it mite be a very bad joke. I think thats just me bcoz ppl at tenison would do that i dont think ne1 would do it 2 mez at mount coz shes is friends wit evry1. I hope 4 her its not a sick joke.  On 2 other news... i have 2 turn off the "lisa charm" (as jim calls it) coz 2 many guys like me. Sure im flattered but they r all the same, theres nothing that makes ne of them stand out from the rest. They dont have that special sumthing that makes them different.   OMG i get 2 have a 16th b'day party, i made a list of those who i want 2 invite and there is like 40 ppl. And thats mainly the girls i know. I didnt realise i had that many friends or i will have by october. lol. The ones that rnt exactly my friends at the moment will be over time, i do know them and talk 2 them of course.  Neways i betta go and have tea and do more hw, buh bye.  PS mez its not very nice 2 go offline witout saying gdbye...he he he only kidding hun. GD luck 4 2moro!
