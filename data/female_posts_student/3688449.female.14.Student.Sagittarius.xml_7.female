I mean, I don't really expect to be invited, but I thought I would at least hear about it...And then I read everyone's away messages and they generally say 'Over At Lauren's', or something along that line. Wow, I feel really left in the blue about this and I actually find it kind of funny. I mean, we had all those stupid 'exclusion' talks at CCDS, and look what's happening...  LOL! Just kidding! I don't feel excluded, even though I wasn't invited! I know you want to have those little get-togethers with your best friends and not invite anyone else...trust me, I've felt that way MANY times. Um...right...nothing left to say, except that my stomach is really hungry so I'm going to go put some yummilicious food in it!  BTW, today has been a total waste of left-on makeup...
