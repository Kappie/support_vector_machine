And guess what! She was happy with me! She gave me the most compliments I think I've ever gotten from her. I was doing my Certificate of Merit pieces, and when I finished each one, she was like, watch out for dynamics.. make this part smoother, and little things like that, but oh well. She's always picky. Then, when I was done with the four pieces, she asked me which one I liked best, so I told her it was the Bach. She was like, "Oh yes, I believe you have the right touch for that one. Most people have trouble with Bach, but I guess because you like it so much, it sounds very good." I was like, smiling, and I smiled all through my next piece. Like an idiot.
