Well I'm gonna put it on here anyways. It sucks, but it took forever to write so I'm leavin' it. Hahaha  “What to say” By: Bailey Luder What do you say when there’s nothing to say And an awkward silence fills the cold air? What do you say after the guy says “hey”? You respond to the word and just stand there There’s many things you wish you could mention  But it’s impossible at the same time You’d do anything to break the tension  Only two minutes feels like a lifetime. Both of you struggle for some kind of words You are stuck looking at each other’s face Look to the side, try not to look forwards Now you both are starring out into space. He looks into your eyes for one last glance, “Well, gotta go,” he left, you lost your chance.  Meh...Anyways 6 more to write... LATERz
