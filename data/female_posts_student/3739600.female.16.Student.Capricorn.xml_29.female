I think I should just stop talking to her all together. It was fun while our friendship lasted but she has changed dramaticly and truthfully I hate it! I miss the old Gaby. It feels as if she was taken over by someone else! Plus everytime I do talk to her all she talks about is Eric or she starts to mock me. It gets on my nerves when she does that. I have nothing against Eric but damn it gets old hearing about him. I could write a book about him! I hope I wasn't like that with Gary. If I was, I am about to kick myself! Then later on at 6:15 I have Drivers Ed! Ok anyways, that's what happened today and what's going to happen.          urlLink         Hopefully the guys (as in Mike, Clayton and Jesus) can all go to Six Flags   Saturday  ! My mommy said it would be ok, as long as we go  Saturday  and she can met them(with girls as well). If so I know we are going to have fun. Shoot those three together means something intresting is bound to happen!           Well I'm gonna go! Toot-a-lou!               urlLink         Much Lov, Brandi*         urlLink
