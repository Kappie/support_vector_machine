I know everyone will enjoy everything I have to say!! So to start, why is it that the News only cuts in to "inform" us with useless stuff ONLY when your favorite show is on? not during the 20 minutes of commercials?? of course it was during a very intense interesting part too. anyway, I just got an opportunity to do some work for a friend of professor! I'm excited it has been such a long time since I had seen money. And I may also have a GREAT chance of getting a really good job too (I don't want to jinx it, so that is all about that, for now!) I am taking summer classes, Microsoft is cool. I am terrified for the other one (theology), it doesn't start till June 7. Religion classes and teachers scare me! Help! Why do people (boys) cheat? I am really starting to believe it is a disease of some sort, or maybe even an heredity thing.? I don't know, but it sucks. oh well, talk later. :)
