It goes like this (to the tune of Mary Had a Little Lamb):  My Verses-  Once there was a Persian boy, Persian boy, Persian boy, Once there was a Persian boy, By the name of Habibi.  He was friends with a really cool girl, A really cool girl, A really cool girl, He was friends with a really cool girl, And her name was Lissa.  She went to visit him at work one day, At work one day, At work one day, She went to visit him at work one day, And she organized the games.  Then they hopped in Habibi's car, Habibi's car, Habibi's car, Then they hopped in Habibi's car, And made Mooney walk home.  Habibi's Verses-  Lissa had a little boy, Little boy, Little boy, Lissa had a little boy, He was a brown Habibi.  *Fin*  Yeah, I know.. my verses are so much better than his.  But it's okay- he's just not as talented as I am.  OMG, everyone has to go  urlLink here .  My dream has come true!
