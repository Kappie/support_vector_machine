Im sure it will probably be different with the new director so thats good at least maybe we will actually be given time to drink the water we bring or something completely off the wall like that......you wouldve had to know mr. lashley boo hes gone i miss the grumpy old man. pah well i guess im gonna go wallow in self pity and probably go shopping if i can ever get myself to actually move out of this chair so ill post again later cause this one makes me sound depressed or something....
