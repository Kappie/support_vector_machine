But..I'm gonna try to keep this one fairly updated since I spend so much time on the internet! :) we'll see how it all goes.  Ok, now for the "good stuff":  I really don't have anything interesting going on in my life right now, except for the fact that I am so overwhelmingly happy! :) Altho I do have to go down to Rockingham Community College tonight for a driving class so I hopefully don't lose my license after getting a speeding ticket for 81 in a 55...Life is really good right now.  I am sick right now tho, but it's just a sore body and headaches as of this moment...as soon as the Ibuprofen kicks in I should be cool.   All of my guy problems seem to have just went away, well, I still haven't told Derrick that I am no longer interested, but I think he is getting the point since I haven't talked to him barely at all this past week.  Altho last time I talked to him, I did find out that he actually got a job! At Applebee's, I doubt he'll keep it for long tho, it's gonna get in the way of his pot smoking and alcoholic-like drinking.    I am so glad that I decided that going back to Nelson would be a mistake because Jacob is so much better than him.  Jacob was over here yesterday and I realized how much I do like him, we have so much fun together.  I really hope I don't get him sick cuz he lives with his grandparents and all.  His grandma is still in the hospital.  Mom had to just tell him yesterday how worried I was the other day when he hadn't called me and stuff.  Oh god, mom talked to us a lot yesterday and didn't hold anything she wanted to say back...it would have been embarassing if it had been somebody besides Jacob that she was talkin to.  For some reason, it doesn't bother me when she talks to him. I don't know if that's a good thing or not.  Oh gosh, tho, some disturbing news: Yesterday me and Jacob found out that we are sort of related (and not too distant), but it's all by marriage, not blood.  Altho one of my cousins (I think second cousin) and his Aunt Rachel that is the marriage that links our families..are gettin ready to have a baby.  So we will share a cousin.  It will be his first cousin and my third cousin.  Hmm...that's kinda weird.  He acted so weird when he found out yesterday, all I could do was laugh.  It didn't bother me since it was just relation by marriage, but he was totally freakin out.  I couldn't help but laugh, I don't think he liked that all I did was laugh at it.  I didn't think he'd touch me again and he said when he did he was like "oh, damn it, I forgot". But we're cool now, he's ok with it cuz he had to talk to his good ol' Aunt Rachel and she said for him not to worry about it.  So he's totally cool with it.    Oh, some great news: Jamie and Red are broken up!!! :) :) :) :) :) YAY!!!! :) :) :) :) :) So now he's talkin to this other girl Sheri, but of right now, they're just friends.  We'll see how long that lasts ;)  Me and Jacob haven't put titles back on anything still.  I think he's scared of scarin me off or something. Cuz I don't think he's not doin it so that he can still mess around with other girls, I think I'm the only one that he's hangin out with.  I hope anyways.  I told him yesterday tho that I am totally OK with it, but I think he's still gonna wait a little bit longer.  When I talked to him about it last week, he just basically asked me, "well did it feel like we were more than friends in the hammock?" and I thought it did but I didn't really know what to say to it.  I think I lost that convo too. Damn it.  I so need to get him tested before anything happens between us but I really don't know how to bring that one up. I mean, how do you just come out and ask somebody to get tested?  Since I'm a virgin, I really don't need to get tested but I will if he wants me to just cuz he is.  I'll even pay for him to get tested, I just want him to be.    I'm gonna end this post now since it's turnin into a freakin book...Gotta get some stuff done before I head down to ol' North Carolina.
