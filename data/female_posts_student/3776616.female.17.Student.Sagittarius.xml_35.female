As far as I knew before, me, Beth, Crazy Katie, and Robert were going to party at Beth's, and Lainie and Mande were going to hang out...  Then Mande got online a little bit ago and asked me is we were still planning on getting Lainie drunk tomorrow night (which, by the way, people seem to have misunderstood slightly...).  So I said that I thought she was hanging out w/ you, and that I wasn't sure how much fun she'd have w/ us anyway b/c she might feel weird sitting and watching us, and that we hadn't really updated her on times or anything most of the week b/c we assumed she was hanging out w/ you.  And then... Argh, idk...  everything's all crazy-ish, and Lainie was talking too fast for me to comprehend at 11:30, and I don't think that  ANYONE  knows for sure what's going on tomorrow night, b/c everyone had what they thought was the plan in their head, but everyone had a diff. plan.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR... So as of right now no one really has any clue what's going on, and Lainie doesn't even know if she can get out of her house anyway...  So yeah, I'll update again on Sat, b/c by then all of this will be over and everyone will know what the plans were :)
