SATURDAY: woke up around 6:30 to COLD air but fortunately, no rain and just a bunch of clouds and the sun was going to come up over the mountains soon. we ate breakfast on the side of the road. as we cooked and took down our camp, ppl that were driving by were staring at us. it was pretty funny. and of course, since we were camping not on a campground, there were no bathrooms, that is except the bushes. what an experience. anyways, finally we crossed the ferry, drov efor like 10 minutes and got to our destination. now it was time to backpack. me with my 30+ pound backpack were going up and down the trails. the trail was pretty much flat wiht the occasional slight up or down. we stopped for lunch after about 2 hours and ended up waiting there for 2 hours because mr. hosking had to run back to the car for some first aid supplies because lizzy had blisters or sum'n. anywyas, we cooked our lunch because we had tonz of time and we were actually at someone elses camp site and they had a fire and they said we coudl use their fire while they went hiking. so ppl roasted hot dogs and ate food and everyone had a good relaxation time until mr. hosking came back. finally we all hit the trail again. unfortunately for me, i was really lazy and tired after our 2 hour rest and i just could not hike any further. especially because the next stretch of the trail was practically straight UPHILL and it sucked. i was so pooped i just made up my mind that i could not go on and just basically sprawled out on the foot-wide trail and said no i cannot do it. finally i got up and with much huffing and puffing made my way [slowly] up the trail. eventually we got to the top of the hilly part and i was like yay, but unfortunately for me, things just got worse. first i discovered that i have a phobia. my phobia kicks in when a rocky cliff-type dropoff is present and down hundreds of feet below is the vicious river roaring by. we had to cross 2 ridges like this and i was freaked ou the whole time. i was practically hyperventilating and almost started crying at one point coz i was so scared. after a reallky long tiem coz i was so slow, we finally made it down the mountainous part and continued our approx 1 hour hike on relatively level ground into the campsite. finally we got to the campsite and set up camp. for dinner we had a feast. renan had brought some corned beef in a can and some of those sidekicks rice stuff thats like flavoured with like cheese n brocolli or sum'n and we cooked up packages of noodles and had tonz of lovely food to eat. after that, we joined everyone else in the circle and had a lil worship thought which consisted of finding something around the campsite and then describing to everyone how it described us fully. and then after that, mr. hosking and mr. okimi "wowed" us all with their "mind-reading" skills. one of them would leave the vicinity of our circle and then we woudl choose someone and then the other person woucl eome back and read the mind and find out who it was. me and frances figured out how they did it and then there were more mind-reading games and other things like that. eventually everyone went to bed and me frances renan jonathan and japhet were standing around talking and mr. hosking came and told us to go to sleep. however, frances was like OMG we cant sleep in the one sleeping bag coz last night it was screwed up but i thought it woudl be fine coz tonight it wasnt raining. i still think that we coulda done perfectly fine in the one sleeping bag, but mehh. finally after much prodding on our part, they gave us mr. okimi's sleeping bag and we spread out frances sleeping bag on the bottom and put mr. okimi's on top. then we went to sleep. during the night i woke up a few times. the first time i coulndt move my legs, and teh second time i coulndt move my shoulders.  SUNDAY: woke up late, around 11:30. most of everyone else had gone hiking and it was just me, frances, jonathan, renan, japhet, mr. hosking, brandi, and danielle left in the camp. i wasnt feeling well, i think mostly because i was dreading going back coz i was scared of that one area, and i had a headache.... anyways, we ate a lovely breakfast of instant oatmeal and noodle soup. yay. finally, mr. hosking made us take down our tent and we prepared for the hike back. my pack was light coz i had drank most of my water and didnt refeill it, and also i drank all my gatorade and gave japhet my shoes. yep my pack was light. i had no trouble packing it back. a lil while into the hike, i took the propane tank from frances because she was complaining her pack was too heavy. anyways, the hike back went perfectly fine. i wanst scared through the supposed "scary" part. it was fine. the group that i hiked with arrived back at the cars last coz we kept stopping and yeah. oh well. it was good. after an almost 3 hour drive back, we arrived back at school. the drive back [which was me, frances, and mr. okimi] consisted of games such as naming fruits and vegetables using the last letter of the previously named one, and also other topics such as celebrities/famous people and yeah things like that. we also listened to mr. okimi's lovely music which included songs from shaggy - angel, to gloria gaynore - i will survive, to sir mix-a-lot - i like big butts. yep it was interesting. finally, back at school, everyone wiated for their parents to pick them up. we had to give daniel, frances, jonathan, and japhet a ride. my mom drove over jonathans backpack by accident because he left it underneat the wheel and she backed up and yeah kinda screwed up his discman =S lol. oh well. his fault i think. anyways, after dropping japhet off at the skytrain, we went home. and i went to the movie store to rent some movies. i rented james bond: on her majesty's secret service.. [i didnt like the ending!!], to sir with love, and we found "in the heat of the night" and bought it. yay. i took a lovely shower, ate some lovely sidekicks pasta, and watched my movie and went to sleep at like 1:30  today i woke up at 12:34 [weird] and then i went on the computer. i was still slightly sore from my backpacking trip, but mehh. around 2:00 i went out with mom, mrs. soong, shan, and mr. soong to shoe company in coquitlam and this 99 cents store which is the funniest thing in the world. they sell nothing over 99 cents. they even had a computer game for 99 cents. =S and weird "welfare" type food. interesting. nasty. i came home, and then i did nothing just did.. well nothing. and then i wen to the movies with shan around 7:00 and we watched "13 going on 30" and then ate some food an then sneaked into "shrek 2" yep. and theni got home around 11:30. yep. now i have to do my bio project and then study for chem test tomoro. yay. im sorta getting tired =S anyhoo, the movies were good. "IT'S A THONG" [shrek 2] that movie is hilarious. and 13 going on 30 was really good too. yep. well now i think i shoudl post this sucker and then do my hw. yay.
