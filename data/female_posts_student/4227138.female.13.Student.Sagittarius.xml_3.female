I forgot my watch yet again. I'll need that tomorrow I guess. She always alerts us when we switch so that's not really confusing. I thought it would be confusing and stuff. So far, school seems ok. I'm only scared of    PE.    Since we have a male PE teacher this year..I'm scared. We've only had females. And they're nicer in PE, at least, that's what I'm assuming.      Think Pink. I don't usually like pink.. but, it's ok now..  Ever had a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach? ... So have I. That had nothing to do with.. anything on here.     Stand back people! I'll put the  FIRE   out!!!   *Wooosh*   And the   flames   stop...
