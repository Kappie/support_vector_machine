This dude is very kewl, I especially like his Furby idea...  urlLink Envador : When I think of someone with too much time on their hands I think of Envador, go there you'll see why.  urlLink Xoxide : A nifty place to pick up some bling, but a little costly.  urlLink OS News : The computer nerd's heaven.  urlLink Slashdot : They know everything!
