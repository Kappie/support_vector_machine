With Frank Thomas out for at least 8 weeks (potentially the season) and Magglio Ordonez not 100% yet, the deal was made. If Carl can hit like he did in 2003 and stay healthy for the rest of the season it will be a great pickup for the White Sox. Rauch was a top prospect in 2001 but since then his stock has fallen, especially with White Sox management. He should get a chance with the Expos and could develop into a quality starter. Gary Majewski is a decent relief prospect and will probably see time in the Majors with the Expos this season.
