THey don't even know it. confrontation is the only way to know actual truth. things happen i guess..  for the worst and best at times.           To end a crappy week, i propose that i get drunk and have a good time this weekend. I invited my best/f yasmin to stay over for as long as she wants. i think my humor and her are the only things keeping me sane these dayz. We're planning on having a good time, maybe chill with anthony, if he's around.          Just a while ago, i was talking to kurk (ex). He says his day will consist of cutting his beautiful long hair, which i threatend to make him in trouble if he cuts it all off. its long and cute. he says he's just gonna trim it. i hope thats all. any how, i told him about my problem and he was just all ears, and that was great of him to do so.                                               laterz
