Around 6, I pulled out  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , but that just made me do more thinking than I was already doing.  ...Life is rough. I feel so sorry for the people in this book. They get by, but it's rough.   I'm definitely taking a year or so off before going to college. I'm so sick of school. I think I need to experience real life first. Hopefully get a place of my own -- with a room mate, I'm sure -- and just fend for myself. Get a feel for life before I decide what I want to do with mine.  ....Can you tell that I need sleep?   If I can find any medicine that isn't non-drowsy here, I think I'm going take some and hope it knocks me out.  I know; that is so uncharacteristic of me.
