You can physically finish something you order in a restaurant.  You can even order more than one course.  It's so strange.  For example.  We went to a McDonalds in Budapest.  My aunt and I both got a McFlurry, and they were quite a bit smaller than they are in the US.  They probaby had one cup of ice cream, and candy.  And that's reasonabe.  Whereas in the US, you get probably 2 cups or more.  Last night we went to a place called Brewsters for desert.  It's alot like the Pittsburgh equivalent of a Dairy Queen.  I got what was called a blast(blizzard).  I got the smallest size you could, and got probably three cups worth of ice cream and candy.  I couldn't believe it.  I could hardly finish it, by putting half in the freezer and eating it tonight as well.  It's crazy.  I now understand why American has the weight problem it does.  And I'm out.
