My second favorite dude was voted off, but before he got totally beaten by Ralphie May he did his last bit.  It was about being an artist and making strange creatures like FRONKEYS!  It's just grown on me.  Kuronue:  And there ends the deepest thought that Baka has ever thought.  Baka:  It may seem that my thinking is shallow to you, but I don't say everything that is on my mind.  I just choose to keep some things in my head.  Kuronue:  You could have fooled me.  Baka:  Shaddup.
