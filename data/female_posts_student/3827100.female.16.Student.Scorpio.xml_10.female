Crazy in bathtubs  Those  innocent  backrubs..  I know its confusing,  I know its amusing..  We walk, we find  I dance by your inner mind     I just want to thank you  The pain made me stronger  The artist is what I will stay      Know I'll forgive you  Hope I'll outlive you  I'm glad that you stood in my way   Want to thank you my friend  Want to thank you again  Want to thank you...     stage kiddos. stage.
