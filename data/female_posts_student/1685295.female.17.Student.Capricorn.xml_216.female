Excitement is flowing through the year, and as long as we are all indoors and not standing out in the freezing cold for 5 hours (you know what I'm talking about) then it's all good.  Have been sick for the last 4 days.  It's kind of weird, each day with different symptoms and still am not sure which day l liked the best.  The whole sickness is kind of ironic considering the title of the post.  Swear I put the title in before typing anything else!  Till later
