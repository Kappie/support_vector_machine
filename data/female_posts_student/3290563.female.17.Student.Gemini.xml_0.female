But trust me to catch a cold at the start of summer. Today hasn't really been eventful to say the least. Nothing much happened. My family and I did go out to the movies to see Shrek 2. I'm sure it was hilarious, but for some reason, no parts made me laugh. I faked a laugh here and there, but other than that...no. Maybe it's because I'm sick? I dunno. I found it to be strange. I usually laugh at the smallest things. *cough* If anyone replies to that with a smartass comment...  I'm becoming really emotional and I don't know why. I think I do...but then I don't because I have 10 more days to go til...that time. Ladies know all about it. I love saying that word lol. Ladies. I think it's really cute. Carly has exams Tuesday and everytime she's on she's studying, and I hope she passes all of them. I know she will because she's one smart cookie and I love her to death!  Today was the first day in like....four days I think that I talked to Laura. I guess we're both just really busy. Lol. Right. I hardly get on MSN anymore and that's because of work, and because I've been sick. Meh I dunno. I hope that we talk more though. I have a feeling tomorrow will be another day where we don't talk because I have to drop my brother off at the airport in Richmond and that's about an hour's drive there, and an hour's drive back, and then I have to go to work at 3. I wish I could get someone to cover for me again, but I need the money.  I want to be 18 so badly. Which reminds me...happy birthday Brandon! lol. But yea. I seriously need to get away from here. Nothing bad has happened...but it's just time to go some place new. Some place better than where I'm at now. I wonder how Chris, Crys, and Meli are doing. I haven't talked to them in about a month and a half which really makes me sad.  The ex keeps visiting me. I don't answer the door though and I think it's starting to piss him off because he'll just stay there for like an hour or two and just knock. But he only does it when no one else is home. He must have great timing. It amuses me, yet at the same time, scares me. He could easily come in if he wanted to but I guess the thought of two big dogs guarding the house scares him a little. *sigh* But there's only so much knocking one can take before you feel like you just want to fucking scream and kill someone. I'm gonna answer the door. I can't begin to imagine what he must want.  Much love
