I have never pitied anyone,above all my self,but i really miss seeing people smile,people laugh. I have a habit of looking at people- and not the buildings or anything else-when i am sitting in a taxi,going here and there.What i see is a pity.Peolple look angry,tired,bored,anxious,many more things,but not relaxed or happy,not even a smile. I am worried about my home,Tehran i mean,it is getting darker and darker.maybe we haven't noticed it,maybe we have but we don't really understand the out coming.
