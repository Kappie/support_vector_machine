Anyway, check it out.  This was an intriguing weekend and Monday--I spent Saturday at a Cavalry Clinic, though I was there mostly for the theory part of the class and did not ride any horses. I hung around with some of my old-timey ren faire friends, and I forgot how cool they can be. I try to be all embarrassed of reenacting, but there are so many cool and interesting people to hang out with, it's hard to cut myself off completely, so I don't think I will.  Got home from the class in time to take Mommy out to dinner at Grasshopper, a chic restaurant in Rockridge. I think Mom had a good time with Jerm and I. We sat at the bar because it seemed lame to wait for a table, and it was nice. I think I'd sit at the bar again. Mom and I had good conversation too, it was a very nice grown-up thing to do.  Sunday morning Jerm and I went to a Mother's Day brunch at his sister's house, with was nice. I probably should have gotten my family to go, but I'm still feeling anxious about being around Alex socially. I get really tense when I'm around her, and it's just hard to deal with my emotions in general around her. Then I skipped out on the old-folks home to get my reading done, and something miraculous happened--I got my reading done before the last minute! I had time to do other stuff before my seminar. I need to keep doing this reading on time thing. It's really nice to not be so stressed out!
