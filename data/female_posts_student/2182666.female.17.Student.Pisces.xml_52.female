Please tell me you're just feeling tired    cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break    out of touch, out of time.    Please send me anything but signals that are mixed    cause I can't read your rolling eyes    out of touch, are we out of time?     Close lipped, another goodnight kiss    is robbed of all it's passion    your grip another time is slack    it leaves me feeling empty.     I'll wait until tomorrow    maybe you'll feel better then, maybe we'll be better then    so what's another day    when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you    this mood of yours is temporary    it seems worth the wait to see your smile again    out of the corner of your eye wont be the only way you'll look at me then.."            i hate this so much.. nothing ever comeseasy for me.         ok so im supposed to be enjoying the last few weeks of my summer, but instead they have been horrible. my friends are fighting and im in the middle of it. i wish we could all just hang out without getting mad about gay things like, why didnt he invite me over? and why didnt they call me about the movie? i could understand that it might leave you feeling left out, but i promise people are not doing it on purpose. no one is intentionally trying to leave anyone out. there are just so many people in our group that it is impossible to invite every single person. so there.. im sorry if i offended anyone, but i have been wanting to say that for a while.        ok so i justhad one of the worst nights at work ever. there is this stupid annoying waitress who is always yelling at the hostesses and telling us how to do our job. but apparently im the only one that gets mad at her for it, because tonight she called me a bitch and told me i have issues. that is so rude! first of all i never did anything to deserve for her to call me that! second, she knows nothing about me, so even if i did have issues she wouldnt know. what the hell.. i hate it when people hate for me no fucking reason. she knows nothing about me and what i go through everyday so she has no right to say those things about me.     sorry about this entry. i am so stressed out right now.. i wouldnt be surprised if i got an ulcer or something from all this. it's summer.. im supposed to be enjoying myself and instead im worried about like 20 million different things. i need to get away or something. sorry again. i'll talk to you guys later.        jess
