Death  I'm gone  and he doesn't even care  I shouldn't have thought he would  But I hoped   Agony  In hell  You see the ones you love  Loving others  forgetting about you  Not even caring to begin with  And it hurts   Pain  Death  Agony  I love thee...  He hurts...  He cuts me deeper  than any blade could ever  wish to go...
