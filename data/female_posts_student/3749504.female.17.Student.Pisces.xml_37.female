We talked on the phone for three hours the day before I left. We were supposed to go out with Gates one day but we haven't yet. I doubt we will, although we promised each other. Save that for the school year, I guess. Random plans when we go out to lunch together. And no more Subway.  My favorite memory is when we were driving home after seeing 13 Going on 30 (cute, but not great) and he was singing along with the radio. The Reason, as I recall.  And the pro/con list isn't going too well. All I can think of is Reed is Small and Berk is Big.
