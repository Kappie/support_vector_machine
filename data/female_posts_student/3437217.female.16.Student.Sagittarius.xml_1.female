He lied to you a thousand times, When I was there he kept you waiting.  And I'm still here waiting there To catch you if you fall. I don't know why I care so much When I shouldn't care at all.  Finally got the nerve to tell you How much you mean to me You said that I was your best friend, A real sweet guy But that's all I'd ever be.  I think that if we changed all the he's to she's and hims to hers, this song would reflect my current 'love' situation perfectly. Me and Dan have always had a thing for each other but something always gets in the way...like me having a boyfriend and now him having a girlfriend, but I think that with us both moving away soon and going in seperate directions for uni and stuff, I am just a bit like "ohhh I wish I had done something about him" so I went to his house one day, and it was cool, I wanted to tell him but I know that he's in love (or something like it) with Kirsty and I'm scared. And now Steven's come along, and he just seems so much cooler than Dan, and he's so lovely and like...alternative and he works in that cool music shop but there's just something about Dan that I want.   *~just because I don't believe in Marxism~*  I feel like I should talk to Dan, well actually I feel like I should get Dan drunk THEN talk to him...ha ha ha...If only. I dunno...he basically told me at a party a few weeks ago that it wasn't fair for me to tell him that I like him because he can't do anything about it. However if the rumours are to be believed then Dan and Kirsty are kind of on the rocks anyway!  But Steven is so so so freakin' hot!!!  arg. enough!
