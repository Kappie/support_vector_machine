Full 35 years since that one man took one small step for himself and one giant leap for mankind. Ah! And I'm late by one day. Anyway, wishing a very very Happy Birthday to that cause. I hope somewhere at JPL they're working on some nice rocket to take a few more of us up there for a moonwalk, InshAllah!
