I'm a little confused right now. Mainly about tennis and my geometry skills.    First..tennis.   I love playing tennis. It's a very complex, strategic sport. It's a sport I can actually connect with, really. You have to be a quick thinker, and also be fit and in shape. heh. I need to work on the being-in-shape part but...continuing.   I'm just angry because I can never seem to be completely serious. It seems like I enjoy the game too much. I laugh at my mistakes...I laugh when people out-think my moves and use my own tricks against me. I comment on good shots...and...well, I just like to have fun when I'm playing. I know that I should try and concentrate for when I play in tournaments but...most of the time I just don't think it's worth it, to be out for blood for a silly little game. Especially all these fanatic sports parents that push their kids to the edge and enter them in as many tournaments as humanly possible and make their children focus their lives on one sport...bah.   And..about geometry...hm. Apparently, I made a high score in a class I absolutely hate. It's not that I just hate the subject. Ooh no. I rather disliked the teacher, also.   So. It seems that I made a high score on the EOC...at one point, when I looked over my answer sheet..well, there are about six big columns with twenty questions in each or so. When I looked over it, I had one column almost completely blank because those were all questions I had skipped and were going to go back over. I panicked...and...gah. I hate math.  It's all..yes or no, wrong or right. You're just doing problems that have already been proven by so many other people over and over. What's the point of it? I just don't understand why they make us do math. And when am I going to use these skills in the "real world"..? I mean, by the time I ever come across a situation where I need to know how to calculate the length of an arc of a circle..you think I'm going to remember the formula?! Give me a break.  Ok. So. I feel like listing stuff. Oooh. How about my favorite webcomics. Sure! That works.  I'll list top ten favorites, first being..my favorite, obviously.  1.  urlLink Something Positive     I've just always loved this comic a lot. Maybe it's the sarcasm. Or the cynical-ish-ness. I dunno. It just always makes me laugh. ^_^  2.  urlLink Ctrl+Alt+Del     There's no need for me to write a reason why I like this comic. I mean..c'mon. It's CAD. Everyone loves this comic. Well, every gamer. Well..ok..I dunno. Just..a lot of people like it.  3.  urlLink Sinfest     Again..it's Sinfest. It makes fun of religion, love, cats and dogs..random stuff like that. It's good stuff.  4.  urlLink Real Life     This is just simple humor. Which...everyone needs just a bit of simple humor every now and then.   5.  urlLink Penny Arcade     The legendary Penny Arcade. One of the best. When a comic is funny, it's lmfao-funny. When it's not funny, you just kind of sit there and scratch your head. You have to know a bit about games to understand most of the inside jokes, unfortunately. But..they always seem to end their last panel with something completely irrelevant that makes everyone laugh. Well, normally. enh. Tycho's the best XD  Ok I don't feeling like continuing this now. I'll do it later. Maybe. Procrastinating is always nice. ^_^  Song for today: Funky Town by Lipps Inc.
