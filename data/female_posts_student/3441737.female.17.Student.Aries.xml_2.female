Sometimes it's good to walk through the halways, catch the tune of a classic, and smile as a cute little blonde girl passes on the joy of Sting to your achey breaky heart.  Jasmine will mock my surge of inspiration on her not so cool livejournal, but it's real my friends it is real.  So, I wonder if I exude my discomfort and as a result create the rubber glue effect ( e for noun a for verb).  Seniors are leaving tomorrow...surreal.
