The new superintendent has been lurking around our school for weeks, I wonder when he'll realize he has his own building? He put on a random talk about India today because he grew up there and all that lovely stuff. I was actually trying to be serious and listen because he's a pretty cool guy. Almost made it all the way through his speech too, then Helen kicked me really hard in the shin (with steel-toed boots too) and I ended up making an arse of myself as usual. I started swearing at her and everyone turned to look at me. Loverly.
