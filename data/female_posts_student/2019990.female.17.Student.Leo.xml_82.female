I added a guy to my msn that I had talked to at knowledge bowl a few years ago, and saw again at yearbook camp.  When I talked to him he seemed like a perfectly nice guy, even funny.  Well, I started talking to him on msn tonight, and we talked about yearbook, knowledge Bowl, and then got on the topic of Musicals.  He told me that he thought Rent sucked, so I asked him what he though a good musical was.  I though I was only being fair, considering I loved Rent, and didn't yell.  Well then he goes on to tell me about a composer/writer he really liked.  I asked him what musicals he had written, and this guy responds with, and I quote "Wow, you really don't know much about musicals do you?"  Now I was wondering whether I should take offense to some of the things he said earlier, but decided not to.  After this though, I was shocked, and informed him that it wasn't nice to make fun of people who don't know as much as you.  Then we got in a big fight,  he didn't play fair, called me a bitch, stubborn, pretentious, and judgemental.  I was impressed, I've never been called stubborn before.  You know I think we could really turn out to be best friends.  Oh wait....  I don't know why I blogged about this except I need somewhere to relieve my shock.  Well, no he has blocked me, so I gues I don't have to worry about it anymore huh?  It's just so wierd, he seemed so nice.  I don't think I'm a good judge of people.
