She's two years younger than me after all. But I'm still pumped because it's gonna be one of those four day traditional Bengali weddings, complete with the bridal blessing, groom blessing (the "gayer holuds"), wedding ceremony/reception ("beeay"), and groom's party("bowbhaat"). Lots of fun outfits to wear and people to meet. And so many old friends are gonna be there that I haven't seen in ages. There will be Hadele and Soumya and Samara and Sadaf... and I'm especially excited to see my old buddies Yasir and Rukhsana (Rookie), and of course Sharmin. :)My fam and I willbe staying with my dance student and her family (Sakura, the little girl I taught dance to last year) so it will be good to see them too. Only thing is, I'll be missing the ISNA (Islamic Society of North America) conference in Chicago for the first time in five years. I guess I'll survive tho. It'll do tosee all my friends at the wedding instead of Chicago.And it will definitely be sad to see my littleSharmin go. So, all y'all going to the wedding, see ya soon!!! :)
