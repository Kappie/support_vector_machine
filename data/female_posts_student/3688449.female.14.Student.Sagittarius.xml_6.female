I'm running many thoughts through my head about certain people in my life, how I wish my life was, and how Ashleigh and Clarke will ever last (but I won't get into that for your sake. It'll take too long...) Um, I'm not proud of this entry, but hey! Who cares right? I'm cold, tired, and I was hungry but I ate! I think I'm going to sign off, take a shower, and give myself some musical therapy (that's what I call it when I'm in a weird mood and I go into my room and blast my music up to the highest it will go and just listen to it and analyze it. My favorite song to do this to it Switchfoot's "Meant to Live". It's just something about that song...I don't know if it's the vocals, the guitars, or what, but man! I love that song sooooooo much! And when I saw Switchfoot perform it about a day ago, man, it was so frickin awesome! On my next post, I'll have to give you a rundown on famous (and non-famous) men and boys who are extremely hot! Yay! Till then all, Love and Madness!
