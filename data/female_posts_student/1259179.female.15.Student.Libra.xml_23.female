I spent some alone time with him today after meeting the gastric surgeon.  I did visit my friend but had him in my arms for 3 hours.. Gosh, she is so brave...  her son   ~ Trevor ~   is 7 (8 in sept) and   ~ Jessica ~   is 6 (7 in nov).  They are coming home tomorrow and the girls and I, will decorate the front lawn with blue balloons....  OK first appointment was on Tuesday with a general surgeon.  He is absolutly charming and direct to the point. He also suggested that I keep and see the gastric surgeon to see what my option are about weight loss surgery. Wednesday, the ortho for my broken foot.  It is healing very well, I can't run yet but I can walk a bit better, no crutchs or cane. And today, I met the Gastric Surgeon.  He is the top surgeon for Gastric Bypass in Quebec.  And it ususally take 12 to 20 months to see him.  Well I saw him and he was totally honest.  It is official, I WILL NOT HAVE A GASTRIC BYPASS...  It is to risky for me to have this kind of surgery.  The chances of me have many complicaitons are so much higher than anyone.  Do I want to chance loosing my life...  not.    I now have requested to have the hernias repaired as soon as possible so I can get my life back.  On this my dears, have a great night and...........Be Good
