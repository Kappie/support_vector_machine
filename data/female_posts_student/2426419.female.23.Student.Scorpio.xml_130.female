I LOVE YOU!  ok, now i said it.   i think maybe there are two issues that hold us back. one, in our culture, there is no allowance for a middle ground of "i love you" that speaks to a healthy, loving relationship between any two people. love is either a very cheap word (my dog, ice cream, your car, you man to sell beer) or it is an extremely intense word that means "let's get married" or at least "let's sleep together". we don't necessarily mean it in either of those ways when we say it to each other, but since we are formed by this culture, it feels wierd when we do. (probably moreso for guys and than girls) which leads me to issue two in our wierdly homoaware and phobic culture, it just feels and sounds odd for guys to say that to each other in a "you're my brother and i love you" way. it's not right, it just is and again we are conditioned not to do it. it's like the touching thing.  so maybe we should just say "to heck with the culture" and start saying it among ourselves and out into the world. "they will know us by our love" right?  by the way lachelle -- i don't know that we can say it too much as long as we mean it.   i love you guys.  j
