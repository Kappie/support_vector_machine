Unfortunately, I am only 17 and have no explanation for my recent, for lack of a better word, depression.  Well, maybe that's not entirely true.  As usual, allow me to begin at...err...the beginning.  The past few days have been unlucky.  Nothing seems to point up for me.  Perhaps this is my balance to all the happiness I usually feel.  Most days, if something happens to go wrong, I have no trouble seeing the bright side.  Lately, however, I have been treating life so morbidly and with such a short fuse.  At this point, you are probably wondering where I am pulling all of this from, for whenever you see me at school, I'm happy and upbeat and peppy and blah and blah and blah.  Don't get me wrong, most days, I DO feel this way, through and through.  Other days, it is merely a facade, covering up my true feelings because "Katie isn't allowed to have a bad day."    I suppose, if I were a psychologist, I'd say I was just trying to keep trouble away from my friends.  I don't want them to be burdened with my problems or to ask "What's wrong?," only to think I am in need of mountains of pity.  I think part of my weird mood is because of my doctor's appointment today.    (I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I need to explain.)    I haven't been controling my disease very well.  I have been lying to myself, my parents, and my doctor.  Writing down false sugars and eating the way I did before diagnosis has put my health into a spin.  I have had this damn thing for 4 years now, and I never have been able to get my control exactly right.  It's so hard.  No one reading this will fully understand, but trust me when I say that it isn't just a physical thing.  Thinking about life, death, and possible complications really screws with my mind.  Some days, I think that it would just be easier to give up.  Of course, the thought is dismissed right away, for I just couldn't...anyway.  But I just wanted to let this out of my brain.  If you leave a comment today, please don't pity me.  If there's one thing I loathe, it's that.  I just thought you'd want to understand...me.  I think this is me.
