Honestly...of course, I would have been freaking out too, if it had been me, so I guess it's all fair.  I'm going to check him out a little more, and then I'll give you my decsion...haha, it sounds like a court-room drama show.    Anyway, how's school going??  I'm enjoying sleeping late...yep, this morning I got to get up at 6:30.  Boy howdy was I happy that I realized it was mid-afternoon with my time schedule and therefore was no longer tired.  I then got to read a wonderful book, "Desert Solitaire" about a park ranger who lives alone in the middle of Utah.  I found out last night that the author was an environmental terrorist.  Boy howdy, he is so dibble.  It sucks.  Majorly.    I have food in the house now.  PRAISE THE LORD!!  (You need to say that like a 50-year-old Gospel singing black woman to get the full effect that I'm going for)  Therefore, I'm going to go eat some of it.
