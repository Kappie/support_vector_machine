So the weather is very crappy right now, and that is frustrating.  It's been crappfully crappy all winter, and now that it's MARCH it should be marginally less crappy, don't you think?  But I guess all I can do is bitch about it, no?  The general population has been just a tincy bit annoying as of late.  Mr. Chemistry Man has attacked us with two impromtu quizzes b/c the doodle-dorfs in my class are too busy a) giggling like giddy school girls during notes, b) turning a sink and a plunger into an uproarious game or c) just being plain shite-heads.  I'm not suffering at all, but please just give me one less thing to study for, damn it!  And... repress.  Living my life in fear, paranoia rises again, Manda
