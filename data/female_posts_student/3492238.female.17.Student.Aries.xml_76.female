One was going into grade 8, one in grade 7 and the other was 8 years old. . . . All wearing string bikinis. The one in grade 7 had black make up running down her face, I seriously couldn't look at her and keep a straight face. The 8 year old had nothing, completely flat, and was acting like she had boobs. This really bothered me. Why can't kids just be kids? When you're 8 you're not supposed to try to look like you're 18. You're supposed to look 8. And that's exactly what it is. Little girls dressing like big girls.
