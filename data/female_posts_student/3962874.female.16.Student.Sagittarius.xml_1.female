Most of them are islanders who I know but there are a few people who look like their 25 or so and I have never seen them before. Not that it really matters, because they are all down having a bonfire in our pit. I haven't been tubing in such a long time I just got this huge craving for it. I would go right now in the dark if I could. ... The wierdest thing just happened to me. I think those people who I don't know were drunk because they were leaving and one of the guys asked about my wiring harness project. Then as he was leaving with a beer in his hand he said "See ya round Baby." What the hell? I hate horny drunk people. Not a great mixture.
