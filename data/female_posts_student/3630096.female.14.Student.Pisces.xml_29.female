She misunderstood everything. I meant everything. My thoughts and my feelings. I'm confused, so confused. I don't know what I'm thinking... There's two...I'm thinking about. One him, Another also him. I don't know who... Confused. Very confused. She said it's him. Both of them already had stead, even though I'm not so sure who. Both in the same class, one far infront, another last. Yet I only think, this is the result of the crowd I'm in. Their constant chattering and topic...something I cannot avoid hearing.. Perhaps it will be over. soon.
