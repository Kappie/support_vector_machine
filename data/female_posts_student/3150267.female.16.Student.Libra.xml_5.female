I've still got a lot to learn  But, at least I know where I can turn  When I'm in my times of need  Just as long  (As I know all things are possible)  Just as long as I believe   I've loved a lot, hurt a lot  Been burned a lot in my life and times  Spent precious years wrapped up in fear  With no end in sight  Until my saving grace shined on me  Until my saving grace set me free   Giving me peace  Giving me strength when I'd  Almost lost it all  Catching my every fall  I still exist because you keep me safe  I found my saving grace within you   Yes, I've been bruised  Grew up confused  Been destitute  I've seen life from many sides  Been stigmatized  Been black and white  Felt inferior inside  Until my saving grace shined on me  Until my saving grace set me free   Giving me peace  Giving me strength when I'd  Almost lost it all  Catching my every fall  I still exist because you keep me safe  I found my saving grace within you   And the bountiful things that you do  Lord thank you  For delivering me    ~Happy are the people whose God is the Lord...~
