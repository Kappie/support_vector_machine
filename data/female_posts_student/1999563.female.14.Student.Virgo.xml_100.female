I didn't make my lunch because I didn't feel like eating. So I went to school. School was bleh-ish also. English started. We got a dole maching, its awsome. Its birght and orange. Then Miss Shultz switched the seating aragments so I don't sit by Taylor anymore. Science was pretty much the same.  Spanish...well I don't really remember spanish. My head hurt so bad that I just laid my head down on my desk and tried to make the pain stop, it didn't. :/ Then is WA history I had to go get my picture retaken. The hall lady yelled at me for no aparent reason, I fel t like cussing, but I didn't. I AM A GOOD PERSON! Then....LUNCH! Yeah...it was lunch. We got our class pictures taken..a  total nightmare :) :P In algerbra we got new seating aragments I sit by Zane. HELP ME! Yup...bleh bleh bleh. Oh..there is a TEST tomorrow. What  a dumb day.   Bye.. I am not as depressed as you think I am...maybe. Love, laura
