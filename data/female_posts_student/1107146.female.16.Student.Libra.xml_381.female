Hope we don't haven't another repeat of that shiet before...I wouldn't have a chance of surviving at my dad's house.  Second of all, I can't believe how degraded the Jerry Springer show has become. Yah, it was bad back in the day...the constant cussing, the people taking off their shirts/pants to make a point, and sure, that's bad. But it gets worse...now the audience has become totally corrupted. When anyone asks a question (especially hot girls) or when someone gets into an argument, it's no longer "KICK HIS/HER ASS!", it has now become, "TAKE IT OFF!" They don't want to fight, they want an excuse to see some skin. I guess that makes sense, sure. But jeezus, what a level of degradation. Pretty soon, Jerry's gonna be just one big televised bacchanal, killing and raping on the twelve o' clock tube.  THE END IS NEAR, REPENT SINNERS. But while we're at it, let's enjoy ourselves by watching a lot of dumbasses beat the shit out of each other and strip down to their birthday suits and rub dubious substances on one another.   Ah...cable...
