It's like when you have a dog with caderacs in each eye (blind) and you know it'd be better if you killed it...but you can't bring yourself to do it.  I'm irritated and I want it to stop.  I know it won't unless I leave.  If I get away from it all...then I'll be okay...I'll be better...but I can't leave.
