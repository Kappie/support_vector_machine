But tonight i am working @ 4 probably till 9 and then i guess theres like Capture the flag at the park with some of my friends so im going there after work... should be fun?? I dont know. I also reallly like someone and its getting harder to keep it inside, but I know that once he knows, the little bit of a friendship kinda thing that we have will be ruined. Not to mention he would totally make fun of me! lol. I don't even know why i like him!!! I just look at him and i think hes so adorable... and that he has the greatest personality. But whatever i guess... life is tough, and i'm gonna have to keep it inside of me for a very long time. I have to go get ready for work... hope everyone has fun tonight while im being SLAVE LABORED! haha jk  ~ Lauren
