(Heheee) Suddenly they decided that they wanted fairness and decided to become communist, err I don't know the rest... erm... after a bit they stopped ...? Nestle was plotting though, and decided that as they had lost money the poor Ethiopians who were about to go into famin and had no money any way had to pay them a ridiculous amount of money just because evil Nestle thought they had lost money when the Ethiopians were communist. Suddenly every one realised that Nestle were infact big poos and should go down, and so they were boycotted across the land and every one lived happily ever after...  *Oh and I got to rule the world, forgot to add that minor detail. :)
