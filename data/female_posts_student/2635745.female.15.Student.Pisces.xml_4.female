I MADE MINOR CHANGES, BUT DON"T BE SURPRISED TO BE READING ABOUT YOURSELF IN THIRD PERSON.   MATT   Yes, Ferrell was at it again. Surprise, surprise.   Let's recap- there are two aggravatingly annoying people on the Forensics team- one is a guy name Michael Honig who is the horniest freshman you will ever meet in desperate need of some Ritalin. Then there is Ferrell Armstrong, a gangly, lying excuse of a sophomore who grates SO MUCH on my everlasting nerve that he is likely to pop one of my capillaries with his illogical, perverted brain (however little that brain may be) or send me into a yawn-inducing coma with all of his cock-and-bull stories about how he is "such a chick magnet. I can land any girl I want."   I'm sorry, but I could land thirty women before even one would be wooed by his elementary charms.   Now, I'm sure you knew everything that I listed above, but I thought I'd remind you anyway.   It was a consensus at our dinner table at Ruby Tuesdays that we needed to teach Ferrell a lesson. You see, it all started when Mr. Armstrong received third place in extemporaneous speaking. You know Ferrell well enough to know that he was full of himself, but imagine his overblown ego when he realized that he had beaten Jake Poteet AND when he touted his plastic trophy at the restaurant, plopping it dead center in the middle of his booth, blocking any views he had of any of the people in front of him. But why should that matter? The only people he'll have a conversation with will be himself and that stupid trophy ("So, how beautiful am I today, Mr. 3rd Place Trophy Winner? Dashing, if I don't say so myself.")!!! Oh, he'll be unbearable for weeks, I thought.   Then he decides to give Honig some encourage insight(never a good thing) about the ups and downs of life in Forensics. But what he said to Honig I shall never believe. You see, I have diagnosed Ferrell with CLS, otherwise known as Chronic Liar Syndrome. After Honig complained of not doing very well, Ferrell responded:   "Don't worry, Honig. It's not about winning all the time. It's about the experience."   Bullshit, Ferrell. Normally I don't curse, but Mr. Armstrong evokes passions within me that I would like to suppress. Jacob Hamburger (who, by the way, won fifth place in Duo) explained to me that he likes Ferrell occasionally, whenever he ISN'T lying. I compared Ferrell to a feminine cycle- whenever women experience their period once a month, their estrogen levels soar and make those female individuals unbearable for one whole day. Likewise, Ferrell lies for thirty consecutive days, has a day where he doesn't, and then lies again after the brief period of time subsides.   Make sense? Okay, keep up with me now.   Okay, so our table, which consisted of Amy Thomas, Paul Higgins, Lindsay George, Rachel Romeo, Mrs. Eckstein, and myself, concocted an ingenious plan after a rather unfortunate prank. During the course of the evening, Ferrell convinced sweet, innocent Josh of the Overton team to go over to Rachel Romeo while holding his fork and Ferrell holding his knife. Now, you are aware of Rachel's phobia of knives, strangely titled aichmophobia (go to http://www.hypnotictapes.com/premade/pg-fearsandphobias.shtml and find a hypnotic tape that will help to cure your fear!), and the two of them spooked the heck out of poor Rachel. Josh had no clue what was going on, but Ferrell instigated it all and chuckled deeply. MWA-HA-HA went his chuckle. GWAGWAGGWA!!! went Michael's cackle, his large, gaping mouth held agape by his un-hingable jaws of death and destruction. It was then that we came up with the Ferrell Plan.   There really was no basis to the Ferrell Plan at first. Jacob, Rachel, Lindsay, and (I think) Paul had decided that Ferrell deserved to be punished and wanted Mrs. Eckstein to distract Ferrell or at least create a distraction so that they could pull some sort of prank. This is when the gears in my head began spinning crazily, and I suggested that we steal Ferrell's most prized possession of the evening- his dinky, breakable 3rd place trophy sitting center stage at his booth. Rachel and Lindsay agreed to hide it in the women's restroom, and Mrs. Eckstein called over one of our regular servers to call Honig and Ferrell up to the front, saying that there was a phone call for the two of them.   The waiter went one step further, obviously reading Honig like a book- he told the two of them that there were two pretty women up front looking for them. As soon as they left their booth, Rachel Romeo bolted with the trophy, and she and Lindsay George intermittently checked on it in the women's bathroom. Ferrell didn't even realize it was missing until fifteen minutes later, and BOY, was he fuming!   We finally gave him his trophy back, but I was pleased even more at what else we gave him... a run for his money. He has now caught on that we are not his most ardent fans, and he will have to cut back on all the BS he feeds us. Either that, or find a place that sells medication for his CLS and Michael's "Viagra Reducer."   Funny, funny day. I must say, the freshmen girls are giving Sarah Wellbourn and Elisa Lutz a run for their money. Rachel Romeo, Lindsay George, Caitlin Eckstein, Rebecca Bennie, Divya Narala, and Ashley DiGiorgi are all pretty cool, if I don't say so myself. I also found myself warming up to Becca Weller's sometimes sardonic humor, Amy Thomas's easygoing attitude, and Lindsey Reid's pleasantness. And, when Mrs. Eckstein asked if I would rather room with Honig or Ferrell, I found myself saying Honig. I'd rather room with a psycho who will listen and tell the truth than a vain, shallow guy who won't tell me that an apple is red if he can lie instead.   I detest liars. Ferrell needs a dose of the movie "Liar, Liar" and not be able to tell a lie for one whole day. But, then again, I guess that is why he is Ferrell: The Lying Menstrual Cycle Man (if you can call him a man...he really fits the profile of Britney Spears's "I'm not a girl, not yet a woman...")   Matt  Now you have to understand he detests Ferrell.  But my mother thinks he's jealous because I enjoy the company of both of them. Anyway another good day.  I spoke with Ferrell about Ted Turner and Goodpasture and Gatlinburg.  Said hello and talked with Jacob and Jake and Michael line danced in English today.  Funny Shit.
