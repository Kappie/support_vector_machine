Okay, maybe not but I think I'm feeling a bit of cabin fever.  Even though I'm not in a cabin.  Hum.  Just incase you weren't aware, the women's soccer team played in Berlingame on wednesday against Berlingame high school for CCS.  We lost 0-1.  Their goal was offsides but none of us wanted to play Mitty on Saturday or continue practicing the rest of the break.  On Thursday I went to an aquarium in Santa Cruz. It was pretty cool.  It surprised me how much we've learned in Ap Bio was aplicable to what was there.  Anyways, lets get jiggy with it tonight.  Maybe can we hang at someone's house.  I don't want to drive much.
