My week was pretty good. I don't remember much. I got a 100% on my chem test. Yay?? Diane did too! I think we were the only ones in the class, so, I'm proud. I'm worried about Diane though. I mean...I am and I'm not. I know she'll get through it. She has a mom like my mom who's really there for her, and friends who care about her A TON! I really want to be there for her, but it's hard. I've never ever been through a situation like what she's going through. Usuaully, when I talk to people I can relate, which helps a lot, but this time, I can't. I almost think she needs to be left alone to just...think, and clear her head. I know things will end up well for her though, because she really deserves it.  I know it's terrible to think,. but with the the whole Andy and Elizabeth situation...it almost makes me sort of happy. I almost feel like he deserved it, but...I know these things happen, and I haven't heard any of his side of the story, so I really have no room to talk. I just feel bad for Diane. I went to pep band with her Friday night though. I didn't know until I got there that it was the last game, and that there was a party after, so I felt really guilty for going. It was ok, and it ended up being kind of fun. I'm still glad I didn't really get into pep band though. I didn't get to see Kelly...like...at all. I did get to see Emily though, which was great. I really just wanted to go to be there for Diane, but Christine was there, and she was cool. I had never really gotten to know her. She's actually an awesome person. I had no idea, since I didn't know her well. So, a couple good things came from going to pep band.  Anyway, I went to Kathryn's house for a little bit on Thursday night. I got there too early though and sat in her living room with her mom and brother watching, "Driving Miss Daisy." I guess I've been friends with Kathryn so long that it wasn't awkward being with her mom and brother. I walked in there kind of worried, thinking it was going to be realllly uncomfortable, and terrible, but it was fine. I was actually pretty comfortable being with Kath's family. I didn't end up going to the Young Life Lock-In. I didn't think it was worth the money, and...I've neer been to Young Life. I'd feel like I was taking advantage of it. I hope Joanne and John had fun anyway. I'm sure they did. They always have fun when they're together.   Other than that, this weekend I've basically been sitting around and reading and whatnot. I heard drumshow practicing Friday. They're really good. I'm definitely going to go see it with Kathryn and Kelly and Joanne and John, and hopefully Nikki. I haven't seen Nikki in sooo long. I really really miss her. I miss Carson too. She's so fun to talk to, and without having chemisry with her...it's just, oi. She doesn't make my day happy anymore. It's sad, I miss her. *Sigh* Oh well. I try to see her after school at her locker when I can.  Anyway, I should be off. I still have to memorize the rest of my poem for my speech tomorrow. Yikes....speeches scare me. Anyway....sweet dreams all. Oh yeah...and interesting fact of the day is....*Drum roll*  Twinkies are actually only good for about 30 days because of the bread. Amazing huh?  *Muah* XOCatieXO
