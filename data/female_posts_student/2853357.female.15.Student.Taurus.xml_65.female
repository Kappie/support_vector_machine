Now I’m going to tell you everything I ate today! ^__^ Wow… I hoped you looked in the mirror after reading that… Well, woke up early this morning. I had some of the steak from last night and some rice. Oh, and I found this bottle of wine with the screw on caps. So after filling a wine glass a little less then half and taking a couple of sips I felt guilty. So, I drained the rest in orange juice (Tasted pretty good, but I could hear Ryan moving upstairs and I was afraid he’d ask what I was drinking… It was a kind of purplish color). Okay… so then I started to feel REALLY guilty, so I dumped out the wine and drank regular orange juice while watching Maury. (LOL! OPPOSITES! So funny…) Oh yeah, and I had some jello… but it was kinda watery so I dumped it (nasty stuff when runny).  I don’t think I remember eating anything more until Dad got home. I had 2 cups of ice cream (see earlier posts at Princess Sabby and Princess Patty’s blog) and some ADOBO! YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! (in that order) Then I had an apple. And then mom and dad went walking, so my brother and I finished the ‘grashopper’ ice cream thing (like mint and chips), then I went on to the sherbet (I ate a pretty decent amount).  Depressed? Maybe… I dunno.  And now… when I went downstairs to eat last it was because I was depressed (the whole can‘t write thing). So after getting upset because I couldn’t find anything I wanted to eat in the fridge, I made myself a quesadea. And then it was bland, so I needed something sweet. So I covered it in sour cream. But I was still craving something sweet so I pulled out some yogurt and the last piece of pecan pie. Fortunately, the yogurt did filled my craving and I spared myself a piece of pie (I don’t even like pecan pie).  Ack… and that’s just one day in my life. Now imagine my whole summer! It’s either I eat excessively, or hardly anything.  I’m weird like that.   NO GADDAMIT! I AM NOT PREGNANT! I'M ONLY 15 YOU RETARDS!
