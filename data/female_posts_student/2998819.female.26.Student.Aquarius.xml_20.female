I forgot my watch on my 3.3 mile loop but I am pretty sure I ran a fast 11 min/mile.    I wore my new water belt (got it at Christmas, but never used it).  Its a slim yellow water bottle that goes around your waist.  I have been afraid to try it out for fear of bouncing and jiggling, but once I got it tight enough it was fine.  In fact it was really comfortable for my short run.  I plan on using it for my longer runs, hopefully it will be just as comfortable.  I am not sure the brand, but for those who would like to know, I will find out by next post.
