But we'll be expecting him tomorrow. damn. Just can't really let Miss Sarah go, she's such a nice teacher! It's better to have her than him! Right?? Uh huh. It's the truth. It's so sad to see her go...Heaven days over, torture hell is soon to be here once again. History remedial is cancelled. I think is because the teacher didn't want to teach and then came the enrichment. I spent my free time revising History. Starving like hell... Rushed to the canteen at the last 10min to grab something to eat. It's our last lesson and we received our certificates of participation and a small token, a highlighter, from Mr Laura. It's band!! Hooray! Hooray! HOORAY!! But something immediately dampen my mood when Mr Ong came! He told me to play my Eb major scale, concert Db major! Uh oh. Just anyhow play and many juniors escaped from the band room because of this reason. So I wander [and escaped!] around and wait for the time to play. Just when Huiqian entered, it's time to fall in. What? Fall in? But there isn't supposed to be any falling in! Joel had napha test, 2/5 had napha test, Peggy and Elaine had their remedials. Who will be there to direct? You won't believe it! Kevin is there to direcT! I must admit I almost burst out loud laughing while trying to tolerate his amusing and humourous commands. Really! [and he isn't strict enough. His smiling can cause everyone to slack off] LOL. After that, we headed downstairs with our instruments and of course the scores and stands. Later, we were told to take the chairs. But I slacked off. Too tired. And we tuned, my C is perfect. hehe. Elaine and Peggy arrived, which got everyone's groans as responses. It is a terrible thing to see one of them here after yesterday's so called 'scolding'. But rehersal turned out to be OK, though there're still things which I'm not sure of. We were swaying merrily, singing out loud, laughing and enjoying ourselves and giggling silently each time when we heard the speech was over. It was a really fruitful practice with Mr Ong around, (he suggested that we hang a life size portrait of him somewhere when he's no there to guide. LOL) he ensured that we always sound together and had the confidence to play out loud. This is the only barrier we had to cross. Once this is over, we can regain back all the trust. Peggy passed me her reed case and I can swear that I HAD PUT IT IN! Somewhere. Maybe in the blue ribbon case, which turns out to be Elaine's. Haiz!!! I'm going to check it out. So I spent the whole time while everybody else is rushing downstairs to fall in to check the cases for Peggy's reed case. Haiz. I SWEAR! Really! I had put it in...it might be the wrong case, but I did put it in!! Haiz. When I finally got to fall in, I landed in the position right next to Nizam! My heart gave a cheerful leap while those two infront turned around to give a sly grin. you know who, eh. But later...Harold fall in and later amin who stood next to me now. Sigh. He shifted position. I don't know that kind of feeling... when I'm sure I haven't got any kind of feelings for him! It's just that kind of shuai ge feeling...maybe. haha. There's another person who always cause me to smile with his blur looks and humour... and they never will know about it. Even though I know deep down, it's just my own wishful thinking...
