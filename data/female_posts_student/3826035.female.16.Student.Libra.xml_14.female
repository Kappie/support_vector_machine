Because I had left it on my shelf for the entire month, and forgotten about it completely. So, my arms overloaded with Dan Brown, Lemony Snicket, and CDs of varying kinds, I made my way to the checkout.  And what should happen? They take out the Nausicaa book, and tell me that it's been fucking water damaged. WATER DAMAGED. Which it clearly was. But it wasn't when I had it. And they were trying to pull this shit on me, saying "feel it! the pages are still damp!"  Which there were *   NOT   *. I know for a fact there are more than one copy of that book. At least two. But they insisted that was the one I had. And it wasn't even fucking damaged. The corner was all that was "water damaged".  And there were worse books than that that have gone back on the shelves! It's bullshit! The worst part of all: I had to pay for the bloody thing.    $40.00 .  I think they're fucking insane. I got nailed once before for a book that had a cigarette burn through the pages.  I DON'T BLOODY SMOKE! AND I'M SURE MY DAD DOESN'T READ FRANCESCA LIA BLOCK!!!!!! Had to pay for that one too. I am so pissed off right now. They were such bitches about it too.   My head isn't functioning right today. I can't walk or think straight, and when I was going down stairs I tripped (because I wasn't thinking), and reaching for the rail, I bloodied my hand up on the fucking brick wall.  Maybe I'm tired, who knows. But my mind was not here today. I felt very... blank. It usually doesn't bother me when people look at me, but today it did. I told one poor chap to fuck off and die, or else I would force him to eat his own testicles.  *sighs*  Too much tea. I'll be up all night. Playing 'The Suffering' again. Meaning I  definitely  won't sleep at all.  But I bought David Usher's newest CD... so there's one good thing.  I'm starting to plan all my stuff for next year. Courses, how I'm going to handle my time and money, and a budget plan. Maybe that's why I'm so out of it, come to think of it. It's going to be one of the hugest changes of my life. It's hard trying to adjust to the idea that now I'm moving out a little more into the world. I don't know why I'm so scared. It'll be so lonely without everyone though, and... yeah...  Bah. I need more tea.    And sleep. Sleep is good.  I should finish my poem too.  Maybe write the first song with actual *structure* that I've written in a while... something a little less free verse. That could be good.  Something to make me think...
