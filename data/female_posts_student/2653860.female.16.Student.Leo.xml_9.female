You should have been there. Joe House and Libby were conducting us today. Joe conducted us on a piece called "Black Forest" or something like that, and Libby conducted us on "Brookpark" In the middle of Libby's song it changes into 2/2 time about the middle of the song and she didn't know where she was so we started on the 2/2 time and Mr. Taylor had to show her how to conduct in 2/2 time. Well, after she got that down it went back to 4/4 time and while we were trying to play in 4/4 time, she was conducting in 2/2 time still. So we just quit the song and went on to another piece. And Joe is really funny when he conducts. the first time we played it he had his hands down too far and not everyone could see them, so we had to tell him to raise his hands. Well, he said that we needed to lower our stands. And he was biased because he congratulated his own section and no one else but it was okay. All-in-all it was a good rehearsal. And tonight is Family Night. Yeah!! Can't wait. I have to dance and I think I pulled a muscle in my leg so I am screwed. But the dance is really funny to watch. I helped cook during study hall and Senor V. wasn't there to watch the rest of the study hall so Joe Besanson did it. He actually was writing down names for detentions. It was really funny. But cooking was fun, the chicken not so much because of the oil splatter, but other than that it was fun. I also got out of 4th period science too. Well, I think that I have written enough for one day. Actually I think that this is the most I have ever written for any blog ever. B4N
