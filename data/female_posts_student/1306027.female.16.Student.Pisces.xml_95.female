Because I'm a freaking dork and talked the life right out of my cell phone. Is it possible? Yes, it is. I was talking to tabitha, and well, me and her can really chat it up sometimes (which is kinda funny cause we really don't talk all that much. Even her dad thinks that our calls are completely worthless. Meh, what does he know?? Me and tab are the coolest dorks ever to chat it up on a cell phone.). Right, well anyways, back to the story.  So me and tabitha were chatting about 80's movies and Keanu Reeves was one of the actors that was simultaneously injected into the conversation. I was like "Too bad he's gay" and she's like, "Dude! He is not gay!"  And then it happened.   First it was a flicker, then a beep, and then silence. I desperately grasped my phone and pushed every button on it's silverish face plate. Sadly, and to my despair,  it had died.   But it didn't just die, it   DIED  . I mean, not even a defribulator could bring that thing back to life. I was crushed. And so I blogged.  But now I must go, for the mother is calling my name (well, more like yelling for me to get off the computer...).
