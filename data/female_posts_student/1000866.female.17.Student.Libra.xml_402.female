It hurt so much. So, we went to the doctor, and we asked her about it and stuff and she did a bunch of tests and she thinks i have a kidney stone. Now, I guess kidney stones are supposedly sometimes worse than childbirth. So...ow. So, I'm sitting there like...not even able to cry because that kind of movement would hurt, and actually vomiting because the pain is so bad. It was really just...awful.   So, then I had to go get a CAT Scan. that was a little scary but oh well. I wont know the actually results until a few hours, but...that's most likely what it is because I have all the symptoms.  Why am I so happy now you may wonder? Pain pills.....heh, beautiful things. I'm not usually a big pill taking person but it hurt SO much and...haha, now I'm happy. A wee bit out of it but happy nonetheless. I'm really worried about tomorrow though. I honestly do want to go, but i guess we'll have to see what the doctor says about that one. If I do go though, i bet i'll still be on pain killers. that should be....errr, interesting?  well, I guess i should go lie down and rest up. I'll probably write more later.
