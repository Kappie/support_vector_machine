I have such a love-hate relationship with this blogger bullcrap. At times it hits me that it's uterly retarted,a nd then 2 seconds later, i must post a blog. Dunno what it is. Anyway...went to Providence...taht was awesome...bought a lot of stuff...working on my parallel parking for...gasp...WEDNESDAY!!! auuckk!! 17!!!! Okay, enough of that. Um, work sucks, babysitting Saturday, Ellen's Run sunday, i want to go to college, I'm excited to come home and go out with Meera/Rohan, I'm excited for stwingfest, (lil tots with vi-o-lins. AW.) I'm excited to play hockey, and see everyone, and stay at Ian's (yea, that's right, a sleepover...hm) and I'm excited for school. Nerdy? Maybe. But c'mon, we're SENIORS!
