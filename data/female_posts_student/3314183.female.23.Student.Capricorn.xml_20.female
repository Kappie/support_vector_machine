You gave me Surprise number 1 when you said "Firstly,most of the things that you told me in this email I have already anticipated". How did you anticipate all that? Surprise number 2, "All these i cud tell from the way you communicated with me". ??? (Eyes wide open)*blink blink*   -Why do I think you are the right one for me- (Gritting on teeth..Eyes open wider) I tot of you as a very jovial and easy going person.  Pretty 50%. The rest of the 50 % boils down to charisma. I realised you've got some problems which led me to want to know you more. I just felt I wanted to help you out. This care and concern has in fact been growing. Until you slowly started to confide in me.  Thus, now this care and concern has became love. I just feel that I would like to protect you.  Emotionally, you seem very fraglie indeed. I do cherish every moment talking to you because it makes me understand you more. I know its getting one sided in terms of my feelings for you.  But i do hope that you will be happy thats all.  I understand that at the moment you are not prepared to enter into a relationship and i had also expected that because of the problems you have. Like i said, i will respect your decision yea. No worries. And i dun wan you to have an extra burden because of me. If you are unhappy, I'd be sad too. So its not good for both of us either. So dun worry about me yea. I am an open minded and optimistic person. I would still be the usual ***** that u can look for comfort and encouragement.  Love, *****
