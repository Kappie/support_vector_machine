It was very powerful at times, but maybe only because they honored the Beatles and Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Also my two favorite modern artists did well, Outkast and Justin Timberlake, though I'm sad that 50 Cent didn't do as well. He's so authentic.   I'm a little drunky-pants now, but I spent the day meaning to read and generally fucking around. I finished knitting another scarf, this one for Jerm, and I'm getting inspired to try another project, but they don't have the colors I want at the Davis yarn shop. I want hot pink! I spent too long on the internet trying to decide where Jerm is going to take me for Valentine's Day... he's going to surprise me with something, and all I know is that we're going somewhere in SoCal... at this point I'm guessing Disneyland, because he knows how much I love it there and how romantic I think it is. I spent so many angsty teenaged years wishing I had a boyfriend on Valentine's day, and my teen experiences at Disneyland were often painful as well; I remember observing couples my age in lines holding hands and cuddling, waiting to get on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, and feeling completely unloved and ugly... I had serious self-esteem issues then, and I'm so happy to be with such a wonderful, supportive, attractive and intelligent guy like Jerm when I think back to those years. I want to tell my past self about how much better it gets and how guys are mostly attracted to confidence, and that looks are secondary to feeling good about yourself. I dunno. I had forgotten how easy and fun flirting was until I went to the law school prom. It's fun getting drunk and yakking at guys in random drunk situations... I haven't had so many fairly cute guys just talk to me in a while. It's fun to have that kind of no-strings-attached flirting. I need to be less shy and do that more. Who cares if a guy thinks I like them? It's their issue, not mine, right? God, I'm so rigidly in control of myself sometimes, it's difficult to relax and just not worry so much about how people perceive me. That's really my big issue in life. Mostly I try not to care, but sometimes it really inhibits me, and I won't even go out in public. Thank goodness I've found my future husband, because I don't know if I could be as open and free as I was when I was 19 now that I'm 23... getting too old to party like that any more. If I like you, I'll tell you more about that year in person. For now just know I really grew up that year.
