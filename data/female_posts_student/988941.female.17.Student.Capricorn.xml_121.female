Guns 'n' Roses - Sweet Child of Mine - have you seen the video to that? Haha! It was made when filming the camera crew filming the video was popular, and they all look like they need the toilet, and they all do stupid little dances when they haven't got anything to do. It's on  urlLink KERRANG!  quite a lot at the moment, look out for it.  If any of you have ever wondered how mice find good sex partners,  urlLink this is how .  Other than that I don't really have a lot to say. Apart from Max, everytime you play You Give Love A Bad Name I will play the Popcorn Dance Remix. Now, You Give Love A Bad Name is a great song, don't get me wrong, and Bon Jovi rules, but I have heard it enough times to last me 'till the Summer. So, Max, this is your warning. You Give Love A Bad Name vs Popcorn Dance Remix. If any of you haven't heard Popcorn, or the remix, just ask for a CD and I will give it to you. It's cool the first time, but after that, it's just pants. I do have another song somewhere which I made with some dodgy music software that I will have to put onto CD for the trip.  Hey guys! Are we already for some  urlLink Spice ? "All five Spice Girls are reported to be meeting up on Monday for the first time in five years. Some pop insiders are even claiming that the once-legendary girl group will talk about reforming." Own up ladies, who was a Spice Girls fan in the '90s? I know I was! Don't be shy Max... you know those footsteps at the begining of Wannabe bring back good memories.
