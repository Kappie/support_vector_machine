Everyone's tired, doesn't have homework done, and is rather blah. At least I don't have much homework. Just some prepare stuff for Geometry, which I am completely retarded in. I don't know how I got in an advanced math class in the first place.   Enough bitching. Lol. I vent and rant too much. Have you ever noticed how in P.E. all we listen to his heavy metal stuff? Trying to get us motivated to pump the iron? Haha. Allie and I made that observation today.  Thursday I said that Virginia wanted to see Jack. Well, she saw him. And she thinks he's "sooo fine!" Lmao! That is just too funny. I told Kaci and he thought it was hilarious too. She said I need to tell Jack and that he'd die laughing. Either that or think my family is weird haha.  Let's see what else... had and english vocab test today. Easy. Physics lab today.. easy for once! Geometry.. hard and confusing as always. I finished my carving for art. It's a piggy bank. Haha.  What else can I add to this long post... oh yes, I think everyone in the world now knows who I like. And I like him a lot.
