OLE. i've been trying to decide on a hot name for him and his sexiness.  it's almost too sexy...  BUT I MUST!   kristin wouln't let me shower before we took our shopping trip so we could work out (we took spot for a walk and got pretty dirty, but no no, we must work out again).  anyways, after eating some chips and watching court tv shows, she has fallen asleep.  i really do enjoy a good texas justice.  i also decided, that if i ever had to be divorced, i will only do it on divorce court. in front of an audience that comments... and most importantly, on television.  and i want my husband to wear a big white suit and sunglasses.  he of course, may not do anything i like at that point, so it's probably best we're getting a divorce.  the kids will be better off...  and i only married him for the kitchen appliances, and i think the judge can see straight through me.  luckily, i baked her some carmel filled chocolate cookies before the show.  alamony payments, come to mamma!
