Then me and my brother were having and arguement about...actually, I have no idea what we were fighting about but, I was pretty pised at him. Thats right, pised not pissed :P. Then we had to go food shopping and stuff and I saw the cutest guy arranging the apples ^^ he was really, really, really, cute yet, not as cute as Johnny Depp ^^ I really do not know how to change the templatey layout of this...how...arritating. Wait - i think I do. Yay!!! kudos for me :)
