His rents are away, so we decided to make the most of it. Friday night was really fun and I got really drunk, but last night….well it was insane.  About 8 of us were at Miles’ till about 1.30, just talking, drinking, smoking weed (except me) and mucking around, but then all these sketchy stoners turned up, including Jens brother. Surrey and I decided to go to bed in his rents bedroom at about 1.30am, and Jen and Miles were pretty much comatose in his bedroom (too much weed heh) from then on as well.  There was only about 15 people in total, and they stole alcohol from the parents wine cellar and got really wasted. It got really out of control and the house got completely trashed. Some smart person then locked the wine cellar, but at 4am I heard fucking banging noises and smashing glass, so I got out of bed and was like “Fuck this.” And went downstairs to find Jenny’s brother trying to kick in the wine cellar door.  I then proceeded to yell at them and told them to get the fuck out, etc etc and Jenny came and had a go at them and we managed to get the worst of them outside and lock them out (har har). But they climbed up onto the balcony and carried on drinking some stolen spirits.  And THEN someone broke a bottle of fucking red wine on the cream sofa. Yeah, lots of people got kicked out after that. Then it was discovered that Jen’s brother was fucking some skank in the parent’s bedroom (thus cheating on his girlfriend of one year), so Jen took pictures on the pxt phone as evidence lol. When we came in, in the morning and Eric and the skank were all naked and hungover, so we gave them 3 minutes to get their clothes on, then we made them walk home it was funny. It is about 12 km back to Hamilton. Have fun walking guys.  So yeah, me and Surrey cleaned like mad from 4am till about 8am. We washed all the cushion covers, about 50 wine soaked towels and even some cum-stained sheets (don’t ask). Mopped two huge rooms and cleaned the bathroom and kitchen, before disposing of all the rubbish down the road. But we ran away before Miles’ parents came home.  Which is about now.  It’s about now that they are discovering the gashes down the side of their Renault, the fucked clutch in their truck, and the lack of petrol in both vehicles. It’s about now that they find about $250 of food missing. It’s about now they are finding the $??? worth of wine and spirits missing from their cellar.    Lol, good luck Miles.    And to top it all off someone nicked my phone, but I'm pretty sure I know who it is, so I'm gonna set them on fire.
