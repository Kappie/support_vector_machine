Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) consistent with demyelination (MS).  i have probable laboratory supported evidence which suggests multiple sclerosis, but i've only had a single demyelinating event.    so, while the spinal tap and the evoked potentials did not confirm MS, the MRI and the biopsy did.  presenting with seizures.  looking like a tumor.  good god.  makes my head spin.  almost literally.    basically, i will probably have another episode within the next year or two, so dr p wants to go ahead with the avonex to better my chances of not having another episode.  i should be on the avonex next week.  an imperfect decision, but given what we know, it seems like the best one to make.  in the meantime, she's going to push up my MRI date (currently scheduled for june 8th) by a week so she can see what is going on, then put me on steroids to lessen the inflamation so i can (hopefully) get my sight back.  apparently, the steroids will send my appetite through the roof and i'll get all revved up.  um, great?    at least i have a name.  at least i had the ambiguity confirmed by someone who has a lot more knowledge than i do.  at least i'm going to be doing something about it.  somehow all of this doesn't really offer me any relief right now.
