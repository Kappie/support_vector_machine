I hate her.  I hate her.  I hate her.  *a red and black shoe flies through the air and hits Baka in the head*  Baka:  *falls down*  What the...?!  Kurama:  *helps Baka to her feet*  That always seems to happen to Baka even when Dais is far away.  *somewhere far away*  Yusuke:  *looking at Dais' foot*  What happened to your shoe?  Dais:  Baka must have been drooling over Kurama again.  Kuwabara:  Is her real name Baka?  Dais:  Yeah, numb nuts, and she's a lot smarter than you.  *Kuwabara glares at the youkai stupidly*  *back to the chat*  Baka:  Feh.  Jenn:  Aww!  Baka looks so cute when she's pouting.  Baka:  Shut up!  *mumbles*  I can hear you, you know.
