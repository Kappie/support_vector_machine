That's what happened to me today, frankly I'm not even that close to my super. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't even know my name, but then how the hell did he know that I work with computers? His computer is running Windows ME and is laced with Spyware (this is the computer he doesn't use). Anyways he wanted me to help him install his cable modem which won't install properly. This entire thing was a catch-22. To install the cable modem, you have to defeat the mongol like hordes of spyware, but in the process the computer freezes over and then you have to restart the whole thing over. Deleting the registry/source of the spyware doesn't help cause the computer freezes during that process too. This whole thing was such a pain in the neck.  In other news school's almost over and then FREEDOM! Not going to prom? Then talk to Zhang or me or... Yu or me... haha I made a funny... maybe not
