Ooh also yesterday I went to go see Spiderman 2 and went shopping. It's actually really good which I didn't think it would be! Nice romantic storyline 2 lol. Went into town 2 and bought some new clothes heehee...always nice! I also drove to chi and back which was cool tho we went to some friends so came back at like midnight, I was gettin a bit spaced out on the dual carriageway, was quite dodgy lol but luckily (4 me and u) made it home alive! Neways, we have only been on hols for a few days and already I'm bored, I have nothing planned for days yawn, until the cinema obv. Ah well, tonight at least I can settle down and watch a good long hour of Alias avec Michael Vartan... oh my god, the obsession grows.       On another note, the one they call Stringer has chosen to continue our little blog feud by sending me a random email in reply to my one about the cinema which said only "bitch!'. 'What can this mean?' I hear u ask! A completely unprovoked attack on a poor innocent girl, when all I was doing was inviting him out on a little jaunt. Tut tut Stringy, shame on you! May Betty Crum-Swack visit u often Stringyfer thats all I can say! xx
