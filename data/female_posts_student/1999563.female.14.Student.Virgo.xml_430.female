And I met emily's husband is name is Justin Shermeister. Or something....he plays the bass and has cool hair!!  Twas quite fun.  Now all my brothers friends are over and they are watching LOTR with sorround sound and its really creeping me out. Its so loud, i am like shaking!!!   Its memorial day weekend! I don't know what i'm going to do this weekend. Everyone is going to wild waves but I didn't get invited so yeah. :) I think I am going to make the best science poster in the history of me. It already rocks. I just need to find more pretty pictures!  When I am all done I think I am going to take a picture of it to show you all. Its gonna be coool!
