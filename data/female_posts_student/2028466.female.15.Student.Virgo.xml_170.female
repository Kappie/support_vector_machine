My parents are scrubbing the deck with bleach so it'll be clean when they stain it, and my mom just cooked her n my dad an omelette for breakfast...but the mushroom smell still lingers...and I hate mushrooms. Not to mention that with almost every window in the house open, the bleach smell is practically everywhere, plus there are flies galor trying to get out through the glass...their stupid like that.   Well my mom's car is in the shop until tuesday, so we all have to depend on my dad's truck...and it's not too confortable to be in that thing which smells bad too...my dad's a fisherman, and yea, that's part of the smell.  YAY!!!!!!!! My dad, according to my mom, is gonna get a new truck soon...or within this year, or next year...i dunno, but anyways, it's gonna be a bigger truck! Big enuf to haul a goose-neck horse trailer, and my mom said we can start lookin for a trailer! DANG! This is so friggin' kewl!!!! ahaha, then I asked my mom what about my dad's truck now, I asked if I could have it, and she's like "I don't know.." so eehhe, I'm crossing my fingers cuz I WANT A TRUCK! lols.   Well enuf of that..I gotta get ready for church soon, so Imma depart now. Adios to those who read these...
