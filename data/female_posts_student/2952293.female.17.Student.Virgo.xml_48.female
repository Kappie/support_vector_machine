I kept trying to think of some nice way to put it, but I blurt out, "Maybe you should try getting on your own side!" Ahh, I didn't want to mean, but that's what came out. Great times.  May program is getting old real fast. We played Ultimate Frisbee and it got INTENSE. Hart clogger is just so damn aggressive and obnoxious. I was on the team with the leaders. Ann said, very viciously, "I think I'm going to bite Allison." I turned to her and was like, "HI." And she didn't see me, well it was funny then. Pryor made his team win, it was annoying. That's it, I'm really bored now. I smell.
