Baghdad is NOT winning as the clever Uda hinted towards, in fact some of his republican guards actually want to surrender! HA! TAKE THAT UDA. Unfortunately, this all blows for the iraqis until Mr. Saddam is removed from his dictatorship. I am Pro-war in case you haven't guessed....it had to be done.  Apart from watching Fox News, I have done absolutly nothing. There really is nothing to do but go outside and tan. Maybe I'll do that later... right now I'm Bloggin! I have to admit this thing is pretty cool... Ty stephanie for the hint lol.   So have you heard about the "Strain of mumps, previously thought of as pneumonia."? Yea it's a pretty scary thought.. so far, 13 have died. Could this become a pandemic? W.H.O don't think so. I say don't get your hopes up yet. CDC... my future employer i hope has been investigating "possible" cases of this, "Strain of mumps, previously thought of as pneumonia", apparently popping up all around like popcorn. Worried?! nahhhh. not yet anyways.  You know, I was sitting and thinking about random things during geometry today, a particular subject kept reappearing in my mind. How many licks does it take to get to the center of a blowpop?? Is it less because there is bubblegum and not chocolate? or is there more (licks that is)? Maybe I'll go get one and find out.  Besides my deep thoughts about suckers... i have been thinking about CTD this summer. Im hoping we luck out and dont have a hostile take-over because I'm really looking forward to Topics in Bio. The teacher sounds pretty cool... and the assignments dont look too bad... Im sure it will all be easier with my GIANT fan and my COLD mini fridge. But im probably most looking forward to Chicago itself. That city is the most awesome place ever, if I could I would stay there. I heard boston is pretty tight to, but we will see.  Random Quote of the day: When their missles out number yours, it might be a good idea to DUCK.
