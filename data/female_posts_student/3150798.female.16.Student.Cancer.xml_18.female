So, she said they would be re-training me on register. The registers are a good bit different than the last time I worked them. Of course, I was thrilled. I couldn't wait to get started. But, on Tuesday, there was one little problem... Although they did put me on register, they didn't train me. At all. Needless to say, it was a disaster. I spent much of the four-and-a-half hour shift apologizing to customers and managers. I can only guess thatI will be back on dining room tomorrow. That's okay. It was nice of them to think of me. Now I'll just go back to doing what I'm good at.
