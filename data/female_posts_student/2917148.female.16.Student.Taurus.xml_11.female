X.x I was at the mall of America today with my friend that was kinda cool : ) he did my eyeliner for me haha he did a really good job 0.o  I had a mest up dream the other night...I was driving around with some friends and I stopped and went into this house and went to the bathroom to brush my hair but I couldnt get the door shut so i kept hitting it and in walks my ex-boyfriend cause he herd all the noise and he look at me all O.O and held me then we were both "I love you" and sat on the floor. After that i walked back to the car ..... and thats all I remember = That dream really bothers me since he hates me and i've moved on completley but i suppose i shouldnt be so worried...or confused about it, it was only a dream of course oh well life goes on   I guess i'm gonna go and chat with ma man : ) ta ta
