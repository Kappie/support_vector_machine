I figure I've used up just about every piece of paper in my house, every notebook, every scrap to use as a journal. People wonder why I keep a journal in the first place. It's just a place where I write down what I'm thinking because surprise, surprise,I think a lot. I'm done wasting paper. Online there are no cross-outs, no white out, no pens running out and I can type faster than I can write. Plus, I spend a lot of time online talking to people, researching for school, and looking into things, so I decided to try this blog thing out. If I don't like it after a while, it'll disappear and if I do like it, it'll stay up. What harm is there in either of those options?  "Why not take a crazy chance? Why not do a crazy dance? If you lose a moment, you may lose a lot, so why not? Why not?" Okay, this isn't that crazy, but it fits nonetheless. I like to express myself, so I'm doing it here. If you don't like to hear what I have to say, then don't visit. This is for me, just like any other piece of paper or journal I've had in the past was. Sometimes, it may be thought-provoking. Other times it may be boring. Sometimes it could get sappy. Visit at your own risk, but whatever you decide to do, welcome to my new haunt.   S Double W...what does that mean? Okay, Nicholle-that's what S double w stands for. Nicholle is from the Greek phrase meaning literally, "she will win." That meaning to my name has always bothered me in a way. Just think about it-she will win. I always wonder what would happen if I just stopped winning. People always comment that I win, and I do win, so don't take me the wrong way. I'm proud of my achievements and the person I am today, but I wonder what'll happen if I stop winning all of a sudden. Like one day, I just don't win anymore. Then what? I don't like that uncertainty, so I guess I make myself win. "She will win" is always going to be there. It's a part of me--it's my name. I can't escape that, so rather than try to run from it, I'll embrace it. Maybe I won't always win. In fact, probability tells me I won't always win. The good thing is that I don't have to win anymore.
