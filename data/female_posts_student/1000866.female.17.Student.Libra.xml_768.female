Bad things I wont be home at all the day Joanne comes home I royally sucked at bowling last night. Like...the worst I've bowled since I was six! I'm super hungry and just too lazy to go get food I have that freshman/section leader pre-camp thing tonight. BUMMER TO THE EXTREME MAX!    I guess I could go stop being lazy and get myself some food.
