I'm really going to miss all of you, even if i haven't seen some of ya'll this summer, just the thought of you guys being in a different city or state is quite sad i must say. I just wanted to tell all of you new freshman that i love you and i hope college is fun and that your roommates are very nice!   Come support me at the welcome back concert tomorrow (friday) night at 8pm at the CHS football stadium! I get to announce all of the flute's names so make sure you cheer really loud!!!  Thats it for tonight! School starts soon which means no more band!!!   Bye!  -Lisa  Song: "Suitcase Calling" - The Polyphonic Spree
