Thanks to Stacy for discovering the niftyness here, I kinda stole this site off her profile on AIM.    Stacy's my home dog.  We've been kind of drifting apart lately though, which sucks because we're BOTH moving so yea.  All my buddies are moving.  It sucks so bad.  In case you haven't heard, I'm moving to Ohio.  Oh joy.  Thats okay though, I'm sure something big will be waiting there.  Or it could be a bunch of cheap-ass hicks.  Even then though, maybe I'll wreck a tractor in somebody's haystack or some shit like that.  Well, since I'm not gonna really specify a subject in this post I don't want to go into to much detail with any of this stuff. More posts later, I promise.  Byye guys!  --If your reading this then I love you!!--
