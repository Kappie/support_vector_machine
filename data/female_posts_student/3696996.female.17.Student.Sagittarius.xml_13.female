After that sasha, mia, sasha's friend beth and I went to CC USA to meet up with my sis and some guys I played on Saturday. We had so much fun. It was almost 12 so we start to leave and the guy we were playing says "this was fun we should hang out sometime." So we're like ya that'd be cool. So we left and were on the way to Nashoba to drop beth at her car when I thought "How are we gonna hang out I didn't even give him my number?" So I call my sister and was like "will you ask that kid if he wants my number?" and she says "ya he does he asked for it when you left." So I was excited about that and we're gonna hang out sometime and maybe play some more pool. Oh ya and when we left the pool hall sasha needed gas wicked bad. So we pull into the gas station, sasha goes in and tells the lady what pump we're at and the lady tells her that we are at the wrong pump and that its closed so we have to go to the other side of the station. We went over there and sasha and beth went to get the pump out and put it in the tank but the thing wouldn't work. It was taking forever and MIa and I were like what the heck are they doing? It turns out they forgot to lift the holder....It was pretty funny, they were laughing so hard they couldn't even talk. It might have been something you have to be there for but it was wicked funny at the time. After that we went to sasha and mias house and stayed up till like 3 or something. It was a fun night.
