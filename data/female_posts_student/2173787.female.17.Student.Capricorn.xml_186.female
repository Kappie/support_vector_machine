I lie frequently, well in reality lying isn't the right word, I downplay the validity of what I feel.  I either mask it with song lyrics or a quote or post a something a few hours later along the lines of "late night blogging makes me melodramatic".  It is really scary and really clarifying to be able to read back over what I have written in the past five months.  It has only been five and a half months since I began and I don't recognize that person anymore.  There were parts of my blog that made me cry, to remember things that I have somehow managed to hide away and pretend to forget. There were others that made me smile.  But the ones that stuck the most were the ones in which I bared my soul and managed somehow to hide it, almost to the point that I personally can't tell the deception from the truth.  How did things change so drastically?  How did my blog become meaningful instead of some hobby to keep me occupied when lounging in my room?  Are other people's blogs more meaningful than they appear?  Why are some magically forgotten?  All wonderful topics to be attacked at another time.  Out of curiosity what are your views on going back and editing or adding entries to months ago?  Should they be changed or stay the same?  I honestly don't know.
