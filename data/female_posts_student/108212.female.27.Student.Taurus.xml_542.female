Strange watching Drew Barrymore as a brunette.  Wanted to like her character, but she WAS a really crappy mom.  Also strange to see James Woods playing a more-or-less nice guy.  Chocolat.  Way cool.  Very nicely done dig at repressive society (played here by my beloved Catholic Church - but I'll get over it  ), but ultimately a positive message, and the priest and the repressed count and the libertine chocolatière and the redeemed abused wife and the lonely repressed widow and the gypsy hunk all live happily ever after.  Or something like that.  Original Sin.  Tried hard to be steamy and suspenseful.  Enough so to keep our interest, maybe.  Angelina Jolie is quite a screen presence (speaking of wonderful boobs.  KD doesn't really show hers, does she?  If she does, I am SO there!)...  Antonio Banderas wasn't bad, and ultimately, the plot twists were interesting.  Not particularly great cinema, though.
