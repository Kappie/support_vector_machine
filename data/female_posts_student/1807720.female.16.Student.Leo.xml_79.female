I needed help with stuff and so I asked her some questions about the lab and she was like "I don't see why this is so hard for you."  I always get this vibe from her like she underestimates me and thinks I am not as smart as everyone else.  Maybe I am just imagining it, but I really feel strongly that that is how she thinks and feels.  And well then she checked everyones work before they left class and she was like to me "Who did this?" and like I mean yeah Paige helped me a bit but I was the one to do the stuff, and she was like "this is good work" but she didn't belive that I did it.  I felt really bad after that.  I mean that is just an example how she underestimates me and like she thinks I can't do anything apparently.  I am getting frustrated again, I am so sick of trying to hard.  Effort I put in is not paying off.  It feels like all my energy is being wasted, and for what.  My one true dream maybe, it is what I want most.  But I don't know.  I just wish someone had an answer to everything in life.
