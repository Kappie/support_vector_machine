Yes, I've mustered all strength to come to the computer at least I'm physically out and doin something.. I'm getting frustrated with my supervisor, perhaps, it's a mutual thing... I dream that she email me to meet her tomorrow and that it's final no more changes... and tt's also the reason why I'm online.. maybe my dream really mirrors reality... but so far she has not replied... maybe she's out for lunch...   I dislike this feeling of being under pressure, having to complete my wrk feelin all tense up... Edwin (my honours buddy) had warned me abt Audrey's slave-driving tactics..yes, I know that but didn't realise that it's gonna be so bad... I used to adore her adn seems like slowly my perception of her is changing.. before honours started, I was raving abt her and always dream of having her as my supervisor... aeiii dunno if this still stands... okok back to bks I'm hungry but lazy to eat... I want my MUMMY!!
