((of course it's in a high pitched voice and annoying, because that's how it always is)), and then her friends somehow manage some situation to get her and him in the same spot together so they can talk, and the guy is going to leave, but the girl is like "no, wait!!!!" and so he looks back at her with this total disgusted look and is like "you lied to me" and she has on this sad puppy dog face thing and she's crying and she gives him this whole speech about how she only made up the story so that he'd like her, and that she truly loves him and didn't want to hurt him, blah blah blah, and he's like 'but melanie ((because melanie is the type of name this girl would have)), I love you for you, and not the fact that you go to De Anza or drink Starbucks ((mwuahaha ~_^)). you didn't need to lie about all that other stuff. It's you that I love."and she's like "Oh, Jake!!!" and they kiss and make-up and it's a happy couple with a happy ending.   and yeah, crap, i totally forgot about that drama project. what time are we meeting, and where?? was it at Orchard Valley at 1?? waaargh, can't remember. shiatzhou
