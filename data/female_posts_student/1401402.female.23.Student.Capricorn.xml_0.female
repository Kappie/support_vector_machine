Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.  3. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart.  4. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them.  5. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.  6. To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.  7. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you.  8. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful.  9. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened.  10. There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around.  11. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.  12. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.  REMEMBER: WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON.  True friends: How many people actually have 8 true friends?  Hardly anyone I know ! But some of us have all right friends and good friends!!!
