I have to tinker with it so my blog post titles are back in bold and i have to add links and stuff and i gotta get my comments back and i have to somehow get my title back. cause what is this "Unexpected Liberation" stuff. wheres my "yellowfuzz13's deep thoughts!?!" eh, oh well. its coming. it looks better now than it did an hour ago, trust me. Tell me if you like the changes. i saved my old template so i can always go back to it if i really want. i felt like shaking things up a bit, though. new year...new style. it was starting to look boring. Now i got a fancy goldfish. mmm, fancy.
