When I was driving I questioned what if it had been my mom's keys that fell. She would never look down and seen them. But then I thought, well it couldn't have been my mom's keys to fall, because she NEVER EVER hangs her keys on the key rack. Get home from school today: mom's car is in the driveway and there is a message that says "I've lost my keys, don't panic!" ANd where are her keys? On the ground under the key rack.  I went to school early to finish up my history works cited. The early kids have a lot of fun in the library. There are no evil librarians, so you can go crazy. I had my English presentation today. It was literally 10 minutes, no more. I don't care. Then I was walking back to my seat and I tripped and Dr. Doden said something sarcastic. I asked him if he feels he'll get fired often since he is crazy and has a lot of shenanigans, I think he was offended. Then I was explaining our idea of True Life: I'm a High School Senior at an All-Girl School, Dr. D is openly opposed to it. He thinks it would turn into a sex documentary. Crazy. Mr. O told us about Reagan's SDI idea. Okay no. Harnessing the power of the laser beam into satellites that can magically shoot down flying missiles-NEVER IN HELL WILL THAT WORK. PERIOD. We got a study hall in chem. Doc whipped out his change purse and put on some chapstick, I laughed! We watched Mar-mar's presentation in Spanish. It was really good and she thanked the class for all the good times at the end of it. It was so sweet! I went to lunch with Mrs. Ryan, that was okay. Then I had study hall. 8th period I had to meet with Fox Forever to discuss tutoring. Next week is our last week, it's a party thing, everybody come. I had to drive down there after school and talk to them- CRaZY! I talked to Maria during the day. She's awesome. She completely forgot I presented today in English, damn you Maria! Love that kid. WEll that's all for now-bye bye.
