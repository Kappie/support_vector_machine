What makes the kids calling her a "poser" think they invented what "punks" should look like and decided to be fashion police? I thought they were tired of the "fashion" thing so they dress like  that  to be "different". If you know me then you know what I think about it. It's all bullcrap. Some people think they started this rebellious fashion statement but they haven't. Where do you think they got the idea?? It just popped in their head?? Wrong. The media told them to dress that way, and act that way. So why not stop worrying about what other people are wearing and just appreciate them for a human in having their own beliefs, customs and styles? There is a point to this continuous rambling, 1) Do what you want, don't try to be like others, be yourself, etc. 2) I like the song #4 on Lavigne's record. In fact, some would say Lloyd and I are obsessed with it...
