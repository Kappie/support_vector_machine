I have my jury in like two days...theres a potential disaster right there. Then I have my algebra final, which I have to get at least a 91% on the get an A. And I really need that A in case I mess my jury up. Then theres my gym final...I'm right on the border of an A and a B, so there another thing I have to worry about. Just three more days...three more days. Oh and to add on top of that, I have a parade in a week! I'm supposed to have memorized music that I've barely looked at twice! What kind of example am I setting? Seriously! I know the stupid brass guy is gonna make us do something stupid to show we memorized it, and I'm going to fall on my ass because I don't have a clue. Ok. Just three more days, three more days....
