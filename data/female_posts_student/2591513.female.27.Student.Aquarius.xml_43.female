I don't know, but I do know that the medication doesn't help...teh vicodine helps the headaches because it knocks me out.  We had a nice visit with Kathleen.  although, I don't approve of her calling me Lanie....call it an ego thing, I EARNED the title ATE.  So yes, I demand that it be used frequently.  Hell it is the one luxury given to me by this family.  I might as well enjoy it.  I guess I got it from my parents. I always thought it was cool that they respected my mom and dad so much they always referred to them as ate and kuya.  My mom is younger than some of my dad's siblings, but out of their respect to my dad, they call his wife ate.  I want that for me and Ed.  I think it is cool when I hear Nalani tell non-family people that her kuya this and her kuya that...it is just a great sign of respect that I want my children, grandchildren, etc. to have...I don't care if they marry into another race or what.  Okay, anyway, I better get back to my essay.  I love you guys and thanks for all the well wishes.  I am sure God will take care of me and that this will all be resolved soon.  I will keep you guys updated with my condition.
