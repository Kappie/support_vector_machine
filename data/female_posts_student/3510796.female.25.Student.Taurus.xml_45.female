Look at this set list.  If I can count, and I can, then this means....shit.  I wonder if something happened, somewhere, and they forget about their other songs.  Ah well, here I am, complaining about a set list I wasn't even a part of.  I should just be happy.  I am happy, but I am also damn confused.    Second, the Cubbies.  Ah yes, PISS ON THE CARDS!!  Tomorrow.  White Sox lost by the way.  Mmmm, I can already taste the beer.     urlLink Check this site out.   Sit down and have a cold one while you're at it.    Peace.Love.DMB.
