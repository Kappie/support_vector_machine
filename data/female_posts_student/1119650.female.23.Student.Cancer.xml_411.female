So now everyone will have the same features with or without paying, but becuase I bellied up to the bar and acutally  paid  for this thing back in the day, they're doing something very nice for me.  They're giving me a  urlLink FREE BLOGGER HOODIE!   I know you're all jealous 'cause you're prolly like me and stare longingly at the Blogger  Google merchandise, but you just can't bring yourself to pay for it.  Now I get to have the pretty hoodie and be warm and blogalicious all over town.  I know, I know its not really free, but since I'm not shelling out for it now, its all good in the 'hood(ie!).  What has movable type ever given you?  Suckers!
