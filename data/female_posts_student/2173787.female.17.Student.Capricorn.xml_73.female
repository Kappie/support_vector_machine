Why is it that we spend all of this time locked indoors relearning what we already should know, instead of doing something useful...or if that is too much to ask... something enjoyable.  I do not know a single person who gains anything but an artificial number written on copy paper from cramming, except maybe a headache.  Instead of having a week of midterms we should have some sort of all encompassing project or activity that could somehow demonstrate our knowledge without forcing us to sit in a room and silently take a 2 hour test on 4 months of material.  But what do I know...I'm just the person who has to take the test, surely my opinion means nothing.
