Although he sat there and asked me to give him details about the whole night. I said I didnt really remember anything..but, that kind of was the truth. I used to lay in bed and remember every detail..but I guess that I've kind of tried to forget so I wouldnt feel bad anymore. Im assuming that I was successful now.   NegativeWilliam: It's not a big deal.. NegativeWilliam: and you didn't even rEALLy lie.. NegativeWilliam: I just, need you here so i'm looking at you, realizing you're mine.. NegativeWilliam: i don't feel like you're mine anymore.   But Bill and I want a baby...we really do, and there's nothing that is going to change my mind. We realize that our parents would hate us and shit...but, I know that once they saw him/her they'd fall in love. Bill wants us to have a full year of fulfillment in our relationship..before we try. I think we're ready now, but I will wait. I'll wait forever I guess...I want his child. Nobody elses.   Im leaving...I keep running out of things to say.
