SAC (again, for track this time) pictures here...   urlLink  http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=cegxtsb.ad4oggtb=1y=-b6ucrm    And Mexico pictures here...   urlLink  http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=cegxtsb.6i19bhe7=1y=17uz71    I know, I know, I haven't been on in a long time. A long time equalling about three months, or even more. I've been avoiding the "online cravings" that have been calling. Come now, if you're a high school student, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Don't deny that you want to sign on to AOL IM every time the computer starts up. So there. I've successfully ignored the little yellow man for a very long time. You will probably see me(yoormaisunshyne) again once the summer starts and my life has calmed to a dull roar. Until then, I guess pictures will have to suffice, and no, I will not take any more interesting personality quizzes, tempting as they are, until I have the time. I promise more updates to happen as my schedule gains stability. Until then!
