Which by the way gets really annoying after a while I know she is cute and everything but u know I have a life too. Friday night how pathetic am I just sitting at home and watching the dogs ugh life just sucks sometimes.    Omg when is this cold weather going to go away it is so annoying I just want to snap my fingers and make it go away but I cant and it sucks big time but you know what I cant do anything about it just deal...   anyways... Nothing really good or bad happened today just a normal day... In math we did algebra, in social studies we did a debate, in health we went to the library, in science.. ooo yeah that was pretty cool we did this experiment thingy and got copper to go onto these paper clips and we wore those science goggle thingies lmao, uhhh in English we watched a movie twice and still didn't see the ending and in study we got our report cards. Allie's last day was today and then she is going to Florida and she wont be back until next week sometime. School is not gonna be the same w/o her for a week lmao I don't know if it is a good thing or bad thing but we have madd fun! "that's it I'm done I'm going to my seat!" haha   well I'm all outta things to say so I'll write back later bye
