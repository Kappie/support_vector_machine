And already, it's late Thursday, another week winding down. So much for writing everyday.   This week has been a total blur. I've had more appointments than I care to count, and next week will be the same- eye exam, dentist, nutritionist, etc etc-- squeezing it all in before my insurance changes when I go back to school this fall. Tired of all the running around, though, haven't been enjoying my mornings before work. Didn't get to work out my usual 3-4x/wk, and that's a bad trend, because it's so easy for me to slack off a little more each week until I'm back to being lazybones again and I don't remember how it happened.  Summer semester starts next week and I'm a little concerned- a whole semester of course material squeezed into 6-8 wks- x2- plus full time employment. Hopefully the material will be enough to keep me energized... that and the lovely weather of a new england summer, which does wonders.
