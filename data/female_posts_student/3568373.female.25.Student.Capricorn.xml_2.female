So DC summers are pretty awesome for me...if only there was a beach... I love my puppy Bandit (pictures are soon to follow of the cutest Jack Russell on the planet). I love old things and old places....which is good since I'm studying archaeology...I'm addicted to text messaging...I love the food channel...this is getting more random... I love Mexican food. I love learning about new cultures and travelling to new places. I think soccer men are HOT! And even though Robert Redford is not long for this world, he's still the sexiest man alive!    Hmmmmmm...so that's basically me in a small peanut nutshell...and until i get the hang of this blogging thing, I'm just gonna blather on and on. Peace out- hehehehe....
