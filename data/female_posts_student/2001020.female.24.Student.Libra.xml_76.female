And when I'm drinking, I realize that I cannot escape myself by drinking, so I drink more, and I try to drown out what's in my head by flooding it with toxins.  That leaves me drunk, afraid because I'm not in control of things anymore, and dependent on someone to take care of me.  And of course, hungover the next day.  I have made phone calls to my friends (well, actually, guys that I have either dated or are currently "involved" with) because I'm so scared about what I've done to myself.  It's terrible.  I don't know why I don't have any self-control as of late.  It wasn't always like this.  And I'm so glad that B took me home in a cab yesterday.  If my car had been home, I would've driven it.  I don't know why.  I could probably think of some reasons...a certain person I wanted to see that I knew was still awake...but I would've done it.  I don't know when this started...maybe when I started this thing with X?  I don't know.  After M?  When did I start not wanting to be me so badly?  I have to lay down.  I'm still suffering from my recent attempts to extract my head from myself.
