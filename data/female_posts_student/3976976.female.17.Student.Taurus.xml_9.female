She looks out to the world wishing she was home,  To galop in the meadow where she can freely roam.  There are things that she cannot forget,  The smell of different flowers and how the sun may set.  Please let her go and let the Mustang free,  for the deeper meaning is the Mustangstruly me.  I've been caged up to many times before,  My wings have been clipped so i may never soar.  Hope is all I have but how far will it go,  There are things that i wish i could know.  Maybe one day you will finally see,  the damage you have caused me and the person I can't be,  I will strive on and do what i can do,  there is no point in always feeling blue.  I thank all my friends for always standing near.  And to my new friend of who i share a fear,  Fuck the world who hates us because we speak our mind,  but always be happy of the things that you may find.  live life today and let go of the past,  this life is truly wonderful but damn it goes to fast.   well.. i think thats as far as this poem can go.. my mind has quit thinkin and well it has a good length right now! thanks also for people who comment on these! Hopefully you appreciate things as they are, and if you see yourself in one of my " hate blogs" well maybe you have a better understandin why people may fuckin hate you.. im just speakin my mind and tellin you what others may be scared to say!
