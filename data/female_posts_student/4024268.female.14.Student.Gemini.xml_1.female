I have made a list of pros and cons, here they are:  Pros: -I'd get to show off to people       -My dad would be proud       -I am mentally ready for varsity players       -I am physically ready for varsity players  Cons: -Not enough playing time for me personally       -I wouldn't be able to 'lead' (which is the only think I know how to do)       -1 girl on the team  I would NOT be able to play together right  Hmm, so you tell me, what do you think -- varsity or jv?
