I bet you don't even know what it's like to be criticized and judged just based on your anatomy,   sir.   I like "baka." Besides, Mr. K understands it better; it's his own language.  *Visions of drunk demons dancing in her head...*    Humans are indeed confusing, but I would like to point out that they're not impossible to live with.    Jack, you up for keeping to your beer and not touching rum? Miss V says that beer is bad enough (for you), but rum sounds to be even worse.
