Then you start expecting them to do well, and the bottom drops out.  You really do have to have a good self-loathing streak in you to support this team.  Guess that's why the South Side and I are a natural fit.  Worked the always annoying midshift today, and then headed over to Dave and Suzzy's for some backyard festivities.  Grilling, drinking, and playing badminton in next-to-no light - now that's a quality evening, and I didn't even mention the S'mores.  A lot of Dave's wrestling buddies were there, and they're just a bunch of people who are cool as hell.  I got to meet a lot of them on Halloween and New Year's Eve, instantly clicked with them, and had a blast.  So yeah, my friend Dave used to be part of this local wrestling promotion.  He was never one to get in the ring, which is probably a good thing, since this took place during part of the 9-year stretch of Dave's life when he spent every day baked like a bundt cake.  The promotion is still going strong, it's one of those lower-level ones that makes the rounds in bars, convention halls, and hotel ballrooms, and I'd love to go to one of their shows sometimes, just from hearing about all of the crazy stuff these guys and girls script.  Tomorrow, or later today, technically, starts with work from 8-5.  Then it's off to Nicole's for her graduation party, with a giant bowl of pasta salad and a cooler of fun in hand.  Promises to be a great evening as long as the weather holds up.  I better be careful here; I'm starting to patch together something that resembles an actual social life.  Who knows what that could lead to?  So there you have it.  Go Sox!  And Grey, try to figure out what the heck's wrong with your phone so I can go back to doing what I do best - harassing you with text messages.
