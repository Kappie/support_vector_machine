AP Bio test is officially over! wahoo!! Yea, I def got a negative score on it, but that's ok.  at least its over.  Dad had his promotion ceremony on Thursday.  It was nice.  I can't believe I'm almost done high school.  I'm ready to go.  I'm tired of all the freaking drama.  I can't take it.  Going to miss some things though.  I dunno.  I have a lot of regrets.  Well... I dunno.  Today was at school for the baseball game and lax practice.  Softball had off, it's amazing.  Anyway, I trained for them then went out to the car show cause Matt was in it.  Well, not Matt but his car was :-P.  anyway was out there for a while.  He didn't win but that's ok.  Then went back to his house and hung out for a while.  It was nice.  Came home and took a 3 hour nap.  Weird.... anyway... I don't know what else to say so later!
