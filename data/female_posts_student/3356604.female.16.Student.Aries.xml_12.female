Interestingly, we met up with Alysha as soon as we got there. She was seeing the movie with her mum and siblings, so we decided to see it with them and see spiderman later. Shrek was hilarious, the best bit I think was the short at the end, when Dragon meets up with Donkey. I won't spoil it, but see it and know what I mean. We went and had lunch, which was interesting, because Alysha's reappearing cousin and his posse of white-jumpered goons kept reappearing. I also had to shop for my sister's birthday present, which was about 5 days overdue, and ended up purchasing some really nice stich perfume and then some psycho stripey socks. Then Adam and I bid our farewells to Alysha and her lot, and went to see spiderman. I didn't mind seeing two movies in one day, it was quite fun really, but I don't think I'll do it too often. I think by the end of it I had been sitting down for way too long. Oh, by the way, see Shrek and Spiderman...they are both excellent.
