Wohoo, he's soo cute. My mom's like "Is Adam the new hottie in Leela's life?" "Yes mommy, I am going to fuck him next time I see him too." Haha, I wonder what her response to that would be. Ooh, big news. Anna, Tara,  I have decided to name of our band. Riverside Romance. I came up with it, Oh baby. I can't wait to get this band thing started. Some Josh dude IMed me on bolt, so that's another Josh that I have to talk about. (besides Josh Brauct, Josh Gainer, Josh Mayhue,  whoever the hell else, I'm forgetting). I appealed to him somehow, I guess it's due to my beautiful taste in music and everything. This band is weak, but in a couple years, I bet we'll be rockin', we have to set up a practice schedual and everything. OH and Andy apologized to me last night, Whoppee! I'm really over what happened between me and him. I'm concentrating on Adam and yes, I'm going to say the name of my baby, Wes. It's obvious anyways, he's like the only person in the whole world who doesn't know how much I love him, I proclaim it to everyone else! 1love, I'll write more later.
