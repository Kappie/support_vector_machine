I should be grounded because gravity is like that, but I am the only one floating... and I dont know how to control myself. The whole Rem situation is killing me, it honestly is. It's getting harder and harder to take... He says he is going to break up with Lauren, but I dont think he is going to any time soon. I just feel like he doesn't really want to be with me because if he did he wouldn't still tell her that he loves her, and he wouldn't be with her still... and I wouldn't still be the "other girl". I love him too much to let him go right now... I'm too stubborn, but I am also really impatient. For now, I am going to wait it out... I have some faith in good luck, though I dont ever nearly deserve him.  Time for some Fiona Apple song quotes...  "Love ridden, I’ve looked at you With the focus I gave to my birthday candles I’ve wished on the lidded blue flames Under your brow And baby, I wished for you Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed And I wanna crawl in with you But I cry instead I want your warmth, but it will only make Me colder when it’s over."  "I’ll just use your simple name Only kisses on the cheek from now on And in a little while, we’ll only have to wave My hand won’t hold you down no more The path is clear to follow through I stood too long in the way of the door And now I’m giving up on you."  Ah, the simplicity of pain and the complications that ensue. PS. Had a spectacular birthday. Shared it with the two people I would die for, the two people I live for.  Have a great day, much Love. .:Sam:.
