I hope everything works out! If another person tells me I looked cute today, Ill kill 'em! lol, not really! but it does kinda get old! not really I just thought id say that for no reason in general....I love it when people say things they dont mean. Its so childish and stupid and I really dont feel like playing those games anymore! so.....ttyl
