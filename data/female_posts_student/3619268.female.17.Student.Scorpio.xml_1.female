Since I was about ten years old, I've delved into the world of naturalistic religions and things typically associated with them.. (My parents allowed my brother and I both to find a religion that best suited our souls.. what just felt right to us - granted, of course, that we could legitimately defend it. We couldnt use the excuse 'well, everyone's doing it'.. which is perfectly legitimate and a rule I respect completely).. and for a time, I put these religions aside to research others... none of which, however, quite felt like home.. but an Old Religion -commonly called "Green Witchcraft" by some, although many frown heavily upon the term 'witchcraft' purely for the fact that movies and other media *children's stories, books, etc* have painted a certain picture of it..  although, most involved in this religion tend towards positive things- it's a common rule to 'harm none- fits like a glove.. Thus, I've decided to do a semi-dedication to the green aspect of Wicca.. *non-formal is more my style.. just to get a sense of being complete.. not a fancy show for everyone.. I dont want to be part of a coven anyway.. solitary seems to be more my thing.. although, I dont mind coming together with friends during celebrations like Litha and Beltaine, I dont want this to be for everyone else..* Some things  have  been bothering me though... Alot of people here- and where I've been to be honest- really dont approve of Wicca.. or anything besides the 'mainstream religions'... I just dont want to upset an angry Podotian mob by mistake... it's sad.. I cant even feel comfortable practicing a religion that I feel close to. I'm not forcing other people to believe what I do.. I'm not dancing naked in my back yard under a full moon *sounds fun lol.. kidding.. it isnt even done in most extreme covens anymore..* I'm not even going on the 'dramatic' side of things- a few of the small group of Podotian Wiccans  are extremely proud of what/who they are.. and I wish I could be that way.. they wear all of their symbols proudly (pentacles *luck and fufillment, btw*, ankhs, celtic crosses, Isis pendants, etc..) and all I tend to wear is my Gypsy bell anklet and a Green Man pendant.. (Pagan God- counterpart to the Green Lady *Goddess* ).. Things are just incredibly different here in Podot- if you say anything people make death threats.. (not kidding- someone here heard that a friend was Wiccan and wanted to know who she was so he could 'beat the snot out of her'... its sad)... ((sighs)) I just wish I could practice without people looking at me like I've grown three heads.. I've always believed in what I do.. I just have a name for it now....  ~Megs
