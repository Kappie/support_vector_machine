The reason tonight: I left the new Portifino Cafe that has free Wi Fi and I got back to Raul's and I still had a connection, and had one since.  Exciting to me, it really is.  So I've been taking care of buisness cause the iBook has to go to the doctor tomorrow. Lets hope the logic board concerns are unfounded.  I bid on a cheap digicam tonight too. Its time I get one--I'll never make up my mind so I decided to go low scale and move up later.  Oh I'm hoping to make it to the Detroit Jazz Fest on Labor Day weekend, lets see if I can get it off work. A little more than 2 more weeks till school.  I'm excited and nervous about all that I am taking on.
