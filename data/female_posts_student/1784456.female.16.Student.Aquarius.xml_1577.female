I am going round to Samanthas for halloweena nd i have no idea what to be, cos we are all dressing up. I can't be a cat cos thats what anna is going to be, i can't be a chinese person cos that is what samantha is gonna be, i cant be a goth cos thats what amy is gonna be and i can't be a vampire cos thats what my sis is gonna be and she won't let me be the same thing. everyone is saying go as the devil but i don't have horns, and i dont have a red top. neone got ne ideas *that does not mean do an anna and tell me to be something silly like a light bulb* I have also realised that alot of txt messages have been going astray recently, anna has been having problems with her fone, and robyn just told me that she sent me a message thismorning and i still haven't got it, while i am sat here typing at 18:54pm. Wot is going on with the world???!!! c ya xoxox
