I have a folder on my hotmail account called "Match Duds."  There is no "Match Superstars" folder.  Though, not everyone is totally bad, most of the e-mails I've received just don't fit with me.  Anyway.  A few months ago, I took my profile off, but then I realized I missed getting the electronic attention - however infrequent it is.  But I didn't want to run the risk of having to meet any of these guys, so this time I posted my profile in Portland.  I just got an e-mail today.  They guy seemed very nice and normal, but then, in his profile under the "Favorites" category, he had actually written: "I enjoy sateen shirts, khaki pants and the gentle smell of a woman's perfume."  Okay.  Now, khaki pants, that's fine; cheesy remarks about gentle-smelling women, I can live with.  Sateen shirts, not acceptable.  Sateen = shiny shirt = something wrong in the head.  Unless you are a)female, b)flamingly homosexual, or c)a well-built Latino Salsa dancer, you should NOT wear shiny shirts.  Much less list that as number ONE of your favorite things.  Good grief.  I feel very strongly about this.  Back to my patients.  They wear nice, sturdy cotton gowns.  Not a shiny shirt among them.  Wait!  I take that back.  One gentleman wears shiny, sateen pajamas.  I wonder if that would send match-boy into fits of rapture?
