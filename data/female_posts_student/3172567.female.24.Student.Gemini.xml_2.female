He and I have talked, and talked, and talked about it all, and we're through it.  Things are all on the up and up with us.  "Its mercy, compassion and forgiveness I lack, not rationality." -The Bride, Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  With Lauren, on the other hand, things are not so splendid.  She has realized that she made herself look like a total ho, and now she wants everyone to feel sorry for her.  And since no one but me usually feels sorry for her whenever she screws up, she comes to ME for pity. ME!!  Yeah, I thought the same thing. She called me today, and told me she's quitting the skate center, because she doesn't want everyone in her business.  And she wanted advice on where to look for a job. WHAT IS SHE THINKING? For all of you out there thinking, "That Celeste is better then I am, I'd have beat the hell out of that girl."  Rest assured, I wanted to.  But legalities and my conscience would not allow me to hurt her.  (I ended up just taking it out on the 14 year old boys in my Taekwondo class.)  However, being a cheaty ho is not her only vice, she has been doing some other bad stuff, and her mom just so happened to find out about it at the same time as she found out about the thing with Joel.  Needless to say, moms is pissed.  I guess "everything comes full circle" for everyone.  ;)  Enough about that-in some strange sequence of events, Columbus managed to wrangle Blues Traveler into coming to Riverfest this year.  Riverfest was so tiny this year, you could spit from one end of it to the other, but we got Blues Traveler.  Haven't really been a fan of their recent stuff, but I have always wanted to see them live.  They played all the favorites.  (Hook, Runaround, But Anyway)  They also played some not-quite-so-favorites.  (can't name any of these, they're not my favorites.)  And they played a quite stirring rendition of "Devil went down to Georgia."  It was great.  Besides the fact that there was an overwhelming smell of grilled sausage and Chattahoochee.  Taking a cue from Karen, (or, really, ripping Karen off...Apparently I do it well, how do you think I got this stunning personality:) Its the Friday Five!  I have picked one from the archives.  Its from March 12.  1. What was the last song you heard? (I'm not thrilled about this) Perfect, by Simple Plan.  2. What were the last two movies you saw? Kill Bill Vol. 2, and Houseguest.  3. What were the last three things you purchased?  The Kill Bill Vol. 1 DVD, a gyro at Riverfest, and a Berry Clear Sprite.  4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  Find some new car insurance, practice my forms and one steps for Taekwondo, clean my hamster's cage, call my mom.  5. Who are the last five people you talked to? Joel, Bryan,(that's the cute country one, Karen) Christi, Nick, and some girl at the Tap who asked me if I was from the Philippines.  Well, that's it for tonight.  I'm going to watch some cartoons and hit the hay.
