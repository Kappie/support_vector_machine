Good thing no one saw me.  haha  Let's see...I am going to buy the new Jennifer Aniston movie, except the title has just slipped my mind. haha what is new with me?  I swear I am going senile already.  Emily is sleeping, oh thank goodness...she is so cute, so adorable, but so much trouble...she is entering her twos....haha  Nalani is doing okay today.  So what is going on with everyone?  I missed blogging when I was gone.  It is sad, but I figured this was a perfect way to keep track of what is going on everywhere....  Oh my gosh, I forgot to say something about the passing of former President Ronald Reagan.  It was sad to me because I truly respected him and he is one of the reasons I chose to be Republican.  Other than Clinton, I don't think I have listened to a better speaker in politics.  Yes, he wasn't perfect, no president ever has been, but he did so much for the global community.  I think that his passing was also a reminder to me of my grandmother's passing.  My grandmother died from complications due to Alzheimer's...she too lived a long life, but the last decade was when we lost her slowly.  I think Alzheimers is a very painful disease, it is a like dying a slow death.  You litereally watch your love one drift away into a place you no longer exist.  Memories are so very important to me and knowing that my grandmother no longer remembered the times I cherished hurt me.  I love my grandmother and know that she lives on in my heart.  I know she is watching over me and her great grandchildren.  So I will end this post with prayers for our 40th President, Ronald Reagan who passed away on June 5, 2004, for my grandmother who passed away in June of 1999...may they rest in peace.  I also pray for those afflicted with Alzheimers and their family that they are able to get through this disease with love, hope and dignity.
