And yes i admit i did the hands on bit except if it was to do with water and then i ended up having water fights with andy and max and getting shouted at by either micheele or Nicki to come and help! Oh the joys of science. I believe that pigs cannot fly as: 1. They have no wings 2. They are fat 3. they are useless 4. they just can't okay? Now i think i have eaten my dinner too quickly as i now have a rather annoying stomach ache which is pissing me off, maybe i just need the toilet??? LOL, jokes. No i don't i only went 10 mins ago! Now i am making an effort today to write as long blog as usually mine are really short and boring and i'm sure none of you guys/ gals read it cause i always seem to write about the same things! I would just like to say that i am really excited about Thorpe park and i can't wait to go on collosus and Nemises inferno... Again! I am also looking forward to my holiday as it will be great fun and i will come back with a smashing tan to put you all to shame! hehe. The only thing i'm not looking forward to is WAXING me legs ect... Cause you know i have to have beautiful legs cause i dont wanna be walking around all stubberly and looking like a man wearing a bikini/ swim suit. Now i would like to know your adresses so that just in case i decide to send a  postcard i can send one to you lot, usually i dont send postcards but i thought i would try something new this year! hmmm... What else can i write about? Oh yea i can write about everybody who fancies Simon the new boy! But i wont cause that is just boring. Now me i like the boy that was wearing the top with no arms, he had a sexy look to him, although i know for a fact he wouldnt look at me twice! Now i would like to say school sucks and that i hate it, but me being silly i am going back to take some stupid subjects then i'm gonna be even more stupid and then go to Uni. Although i havent decided on that yet as i dont know what i wanna do. That makes it slightly difficult when choosing courses and stuff. Now by now i should think your all thouraghlly bored stiff from reading the crap i have writeen above so i will sign off here!  Goodbye
