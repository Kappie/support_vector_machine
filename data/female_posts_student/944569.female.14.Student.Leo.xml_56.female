Cruelty to animals is invisible but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist....Some cruelty to animals isnt really done on purpose! One poor dog died when his owner, left him locked in a car with closed windows on a baking hot day for THREE HOURS! The poor creature ended up dying from suffocation and was mostly baked alive in the car! Some people shouldnt even have pets! One extremely disturbing man took his dog on a leash and forced it to run beside his car as he was driving at 50 mph!!! When he was finally caught, he didnt care about half-killing his dog, in fact, he LAUGHED! Horrible people like this should NEVER and i mean NEVER be allowed to own a pet!!! We've grown up with animals since the beginning of time! They're like family and this is how we treat them? It's shameful!
