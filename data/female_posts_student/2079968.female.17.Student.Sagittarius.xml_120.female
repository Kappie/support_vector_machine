I'm just seventeen, going on eighteen in December...there are more important things to life, I realize.   I'm so content with being in love with God right now...I'm content in taking time to figure out who I am. I'm full of laughter once more...who knew a broken heart could heal in such a short time?  Do I continute to search for true love? Not now. I've got a lot of things to do, a lot of people to meet and places to see. Maybe love will find me again one of these days. I'm prepared for whatever God has for me...whether it be my future mate standing, waiting with arms open...  Or if it be a life of singleness. Being single doesn't have to mean being lonely, I now realize.  As long as I have God, I have peace.
