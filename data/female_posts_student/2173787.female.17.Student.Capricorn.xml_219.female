While I have been sad when looking back at last year's yearbook, I also have been forced to admit a few things to myself.  I have moved on, I am a different person and the new relationships in my life reflect that.  I am no longer serious and quiet, seemingly shy and terribly forgetable.  I hope that people now know who I am and that yes, I am in their ______ class.  The people who signed my yearbook now are the people who i wanted to sign it.  there really are none of those random impersonal notes that consumed my yearbooks of the past.  Its just different.  I can really see a change in myself a change in the people who matter to me and I feel as if instead of moving on, I've become rooted.  Rooted not in agroup, but in a location in a dynamic, in something I will always want to be part of.  I don't feel nearly as secluded, nearly as trapped as I used to, and although I am not terribly comfortable far from my group I feel myslef branching out, creating new roots all around me.  I must admit that as scared as I am of the future I am glad to be moving forward.  i am going to miss so much this summer, so many people I've taken for granted, but new opportunities lie ahead of me and contrary to what seems to be popular belief, no I am not a senior just yet and I will have another year to build and grow before I will have to leave.    By the way in case you didn't know, the yearbook kicks ass and I am proud to say that I helped create it.
