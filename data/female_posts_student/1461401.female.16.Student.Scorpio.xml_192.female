Between the homework, and the hacking coughs, nothing can go right. Nothing damnit. Nothing. I think I'm gonna go cry now. Damnit. I just feel so helpless. The situation looks so hopeless. I feel like I've tried so hard, only to be told that it has to be changed. Everything. And nothing. Everying is changing. Nothing is as I thought it would be. I feel really frustrated, but I have no way to express it. I don't know what to do. I'm just so mad.  damnit  How I wish, how I wish you were here.  We're just two lost souls  Swimming in a fish bowl,  Year after year,  Running over the same old ground.  What have we found?  The same old fears.  Wish you were here.
