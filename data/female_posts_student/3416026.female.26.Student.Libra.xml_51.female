I was just talking to my friend Carmen the other day about how if there's something you want, don't come looking to the United States.  Health insurance?  Education?  Mmm....no.    Anyhow, in Norway you're rich, you have public programs which promote diversity, plus you're all pink-cheeked and fresh from outdoor sports.  Not to mention the old midnight sun.  But check this:  they also have "no measurable rates of illiteracy."  Can you fucking imagine?  Jesus christ.  Let's now all listen to Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song."  Cool.
