I made a photo journal of me packing but it was slightly boring and I had a complaint that I posted to many photos [*cough*] So I chose not to post it.  Unless you all really want to see it or something, which is quite unlikely.  Packing was fun. It made me feel like this was all real, it is really happening.  I am going on an airplane without my family and I don't have to pay a single cent.  The plane is covered..Disneyland is covered..Food is provided...Our hotel is paid for.  My parents didn't even have to pay everything.  free vacations rock!  All my nervousness is gone. Everyone on my team is all like "What if I mess up??" [while on stage at the improvathon] and I am like "Doubtful. We rock!" we really do, we are really funny.  I wish I could figure out a site to host video  because then I would post one of our scenes.  They are pretty great.  Everyone at CYT thinks I am shy but then when I get on the stage they are all like "Whoa." because I go crazy.  Hmm.  We get to meet all the other teams! I bet there will be a guy on one of the teams and we will fall in love but we wont be able to marry each other since I am fourteen and he lives in Chicago. Maybe we could be pen pals.   [I'm not desperate, I swear,  I'm not!]
