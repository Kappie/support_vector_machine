Wishing and praying will only prove futile For there is no escape and no where to hide I have sought for Ignorance and for Oblivion But both did nothing but disappoint me.  If its shadow is still lurking   Then I have no choice but to fight But I can never let it take Victory Or hell on earth will be my destiny.
