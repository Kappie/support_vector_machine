That surprises me. I didn't think they would want to come. I'm glad they are though. Noelle text messaged me today and told me that her dad is in the hospital because he's having problems with his prostate cancer. I never even knew he had prostate cancer! He's been there since last night. I hope everything turns out alright. Right now they're like flushing out his system to try and stop the bleeding. It sounds serious. Anyway, Vacation Bible School is over. I had a lot of fun. The boys in my group were a little much, but overall I had a really good time. It was cool to see the kids grow in Christ throughout the week. Well, I have to go now. Off to the party!
