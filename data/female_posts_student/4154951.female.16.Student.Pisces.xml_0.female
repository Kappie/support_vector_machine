I didn't take it seriously this morning, but right now I can't help but wonder whether it's true or not.. *worries while munching on Sweet Chilli and Sour Cream chips*      I have a fair bit to worry about (in order):      the immunisation I'm receiving on Monday (even though it's not  that  bad)      Finishing my RE assignment      The talent show heat      Mercy Day talent show (if I make it past the heat)      Yearly exams.       Ain't it great?   Gonna treat myself to like, 4 Krispy Kreme donuts tomorrow!!!! How excitement! Well I'm gonna try to finish my religion assignment now. Take care and ci vediamo!!
