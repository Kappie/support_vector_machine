It is around eleven. I likely will not get dressed for the day until, well later if I do at all. Unless I go out. Then I really should get dressed. We'll see. I have decided to just throw some pants on and leave the tank top alone. I think. Mum and brother have gone out to get a record or something in Oshawa. Yeah, he planned it so that they would be there when the store opened. A little overexcited? Perhaps. I want a popsicle and I think I am going to walk to A later when I know that good people will be in. No offense to the morning people I just prefer to go in when I know some of my friends will be working so that I can say hello. Yeah. I really have nothing to say. Surprising, I know. But it is still early and there is plenty o' day left for me to have a shocking story to tell by tomorrow. Or later depending on my day. We shall just have to wait it out and see.
