I hadn't seen her in like a week and neither of us had called each other so we decided to hang out tonight. I went home and took a shower and then went to pick her up. I told her about the party that Daniel and Alex went to and she decided she wanted to drive so we went. A few people were drunk but most of the poeple were watching a movie on someones laptop. So I had 2 beers and one of them was the apple smirnoff and it was soo good. Anyway nothing happened to me but a few of the guys were really tipsy. Then someone decided to ask me and Kyla to kiss or something. She had kissed a few of her friends before so she wanted to but I wasn't really in for it I wanted the guys to kiss but they wouldn't so I decided why not? And we did. Exchange of tongue and gum and everything. She said after that we had the whole grab the face thing going on but I didn't notice. The guys liked it. Daniel was encouraging but then after I think he decided it isn't the coolest thing to have your girlfriend kiss other girls. I think he might be a little jelous. At the moment he is driving drunk people home while I am here safe and sound. He said it feels like it should be considered cheating and I think that if he feels that way I wont do it. I only did it because him and everyone else wanted us to it's not like me and her are gonna get together and mess around. Anyway, I love Daniel so much. Oh and tomarrow Sarah and Kayla are going to come over. Sarah wants me to get her drunk, I think she is crazy. Whatever she wants. Also, Woody (the party guy and beer supplier with a fake ID) and someone else were talking about partying tomarrow night too so maybe Sarah will get her wish. I just realized... It's 12 at night so it already is tomarrow. Fun stuff.
