Yup, even Nathan. i've been feeling somewhat lost lately, not really knowing what to do with myself, but it is getting better, and i'm slowly healing, what a recovery! :D Anywayz,  chatting got me somewhat down, nothing is very sure right now, but he came to see me this morning, and reassured me, im gonna be ok. i need to trust, and i need more patience, two things which i need to work on, and i will. i'm going to his house later tonight, he doesnt get off work until nine, but that's not so bad, summer is winding down, super fast, i dont wanna go to school anymore, i'm done, i quit. Hey, i still have those cartoons to watch, well, maybe tonight, yuppers. Oh yea, and i've been getting all these weird bumps on my hands and i couldnt figure out where they were coming from, well i solved the mystery, the crickets have been stinging me. :( that sucks. Anywayz, ive got nothing else to say, work was pretty good today, flew by, must go again tomorrow. :( :D:D:D michelle
