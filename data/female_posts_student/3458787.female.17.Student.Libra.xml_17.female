I am very fortunate to have been born on the better part of the world.    It's great to be openly accepted by all regardly of what race or what religion. It's fun to share racist jokes and laugh at them all regardless of which race the joke is biased against. It's fun to learn about the culture and traditions of others and it's nice to know that other people are interested in learning more about your culture as well. For some (mostly those living in the other side of the world) all this would seem tooidealistic and far from reality. But not for me! I have to thank my friends (from all races and religions) for this! :)
