I know he is coming to spend a weekend with me but that isn't enough. This is one of the reasons that I am not staying in Vermont, none of the people I care about spend any time with me at all. First he ditches me to hang out with that red head, now he is hanging out with that rich college girl, and he might be dating her? I don't understand, I always thought old friends were more important then some Burlington sluts. He never would go see movies 2 days a week with me, or spend an entire day at my house watching a movie I wanted to watch, like when I invited Mute to come and watch 28 Days Later over at my dads house, Mute just says he had already made plans to hang out with the red head. Well, don't even bother coming down to say goodbye Mute, just stay up in Burlington with all your slutty bitches.
