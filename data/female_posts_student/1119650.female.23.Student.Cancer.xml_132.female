I sincerely hope not, and I'm sure those scientists are rolling over in their graves every time someone accesses a site like the following nuggets of filth I present to you:   urlLink Work From Home  -  Ugh die, I don't want to stuff envelopes for you and I don't believe Chuck  Belinda from Two Roads Backwoods, Arkansas really made 100,000 on your system last year.  If so why are they still living in their trailer in AK and why are they still missing teeth?   urlLink  The Hamster Dance  - I hope the women at "Dotcomladies.com" die a horible painful death when their children, spouses and other pets finally get so sick of hearing that goddamned "doo duh dee doh doo duh dee doo" that they just go right for the jugular.  Blargh!  Die!   urlLink Smiley's  - When did punctuation start going berzerk and work its way into our cultural lexicon along with a multitude of other useless and equally obnoxious expressions like "lol", "IMO", "brb" , and "Rotfl".  No one gives a shit what you think or how hard you're laughing.  In fact you're probably not even laughing so "STFU!"   urlLink The "End" of the internet  - Then you get these comedian wannabes who think just because their mother tells them they're funny that they are allowed to further propagate examples of their retardation to the world.  You're not funny, you've filled my inbox with quaint jokes and beat even remotely funny spoofs to death (i.e. those master card priceless jokes)  Finally, I wont link to it becuase it spreads its own form of disease through email, but I want to give a gigantic  FUCK YOU  to those bungholes who just got email last week or haven't realized yet how annoying it is when people send endless chain letters, surveys and "forward this to people and Bill Gates  the Gap will send you a million bajillion dollars every week for the rest of your life".  You ignorant bumpkin.  There is no Bill Gates, furthermore if there even was he prolly wouldn't use something as "antiquated as e-mail", Bill would send his messages through a classier, more hi-tec medium, like hologram technology, duh!
