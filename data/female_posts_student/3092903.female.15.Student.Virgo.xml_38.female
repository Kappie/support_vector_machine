Everything was going right socially and at home fot the most part. No one was talking bad about me so I didnt have to worry about backstabbers..but NO-HO-HO, i spoke a liiitle too soon, my friend. It all started when I found out that my great grandmother is probably going to die very soon, possibly while I'm out of the country. GRAND, another thing I get to look forward to when I get back to sleezburg...and besides the fact that I have been dreading the day she would die for the past few years. Now I feel this emmense amount of guilt for the fact that I may not be able to see her. Ugh, it just sucks. I didnt want to tell anyone tonight because I didnt want them thinking I was trying to get their sympathy, and besides I wanted to get my mind off of it. Well, maybe I should have gotten some fucking sypathy.. I am so fucking sick of girls. All girls are gossiping backstabbers, its a stereotype but its the truth. Even I do it. But my God, i just wasnt up for anyone's shit tonight. First of all, I have no problem AT ALL with Kim, Lisa, Amanda, Emily, or Laura, although I am a little disappointed right now..But Lacy best watch her step, because she tells me she wants to make sure everythings "okay" between us and that I'm not mad, but then she'll go talk shit and lie about me behind my back. I've let it slide the past few weeks like after the golf tournament because I'm just getting to old for this petty shit and people like her can go screw themselves because i'm SICK OF IT. And yes, my skirt is short, and yes, i was asking for it from Davis, but if i really cared i wouldnt have worn it. I know how girls are, but WHAT WAS I THINKING when i thought my fucking friends would be nice to me. But I see Kim, Lisa, Lacy, and Amanda dancing around outside on the loading dock like "ha ha ha! they just got it." I mean, how bitchy. Then, get this, when we come outside, they have the NERVE to ask us if we want to go eat with them. This has got to be straightened out immediately. I'm not going to do the girl thing here and let it just build up, I'm going to talk to the people I really care about clearing things up with, but screw the rest of them. I really want to make things right with Kim and Lisa (why was  Lisa  backstabbing me.. that  hurts the most.) I guess its just because I have built this really honest friendship with Sara and Rachel (and Lisa was in it too, actually, this whole thing could be a misunderstanding.) telling each other everything and not being involved in all of the gossiping and talking about people when they're not there to defend themselves, so it's just weird being on the other side of their antics. I'm just getting too old for this. It's cool, it'll work out. Like Sara and I said, we'll try to make sure everything's cleared up, but if people are still giving us shit, its their deal because the second we get on that bus to Atlanta, all of our problems are out of the window. Scotland in 3 days!! On a different, more awesome note: someone has been really hott lately. Tonight I nearly peed on myself...I have never wanted to go at it as bad as I wanted to tonight. I was ready to do something insane with someone tonight. Maybe it was good I didnt...NAH, it wasnt, i'd leave right now if the oppurtunity presented itself! hehehe!
