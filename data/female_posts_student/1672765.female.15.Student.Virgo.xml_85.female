Now I don't want to sound self absorbed or stubbord or conceited or whatever you can get out of it, but I really honestly think I didn't do anything wrong at all. And I've thought alot about it. But, regardless of this, I did apologize sincerely and a number of times, claiming it was  my  fault.   No reply.  Fine. Whatever. Be that way. I apologized and did all I could, it's all up to you now. I can't do anything about it. Just wait it out for you to cool down and forget about it.   I'll wait.
