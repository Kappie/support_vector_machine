I can't believe I still feel this way after all that has exploded between us! Plus, truth be told, I don't think he cares much for me anymore! I'm not trying to be sarcastic/dramatic or whatever it's called! I just feel that way. I maybe wrong but I could almost promise that's what it is. Maybe that's  one  of the reasons I am joining the army!...To run away. Not only my dad but from my feels for him. I don't want to stop loving but I think it would make things easier for me. Don't ask how because I think I am just gabbering  and making up excuses! I am so sorry for all the crap he went through just to make it work. I know for a fact have said that many times before but he doesn't realize just how sorry I really am. I would cry so much when I got home, after school! I have to admit that there were many times where I wanted to give up. Not because I didn't want to be with him but because I didn't want him to go through so much shit! To me, I'm not worth all the trouble! He doesn't understand how much he means to me! And to see him go through the things he did, hurt me so much! I have never loved anybody the way I love him! I didn't even have to think twice about  us getting together! I felt so happy and comfortable around him! I told 'em things I could never tell my life long friend, to whom I have known since I was three years old! He knew me inside out and I placed all my trust and love into him. he is the best thing that has happened to me! I just can't believe it all had to end! I don't ever want to say good-bye but at the moment I don't know what to do anymore! I just want to stop hurting.....Please tell me you'll always be there for me. If not as my boyfriend, as my best friend! I promise you, I'll always be here for you. If you ever need anything or you just need to talk, don't be afraid to pull me off to the side!       Always      Brandi*
