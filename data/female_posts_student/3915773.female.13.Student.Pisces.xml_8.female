It would be hard not to know since the front page, the sports front page, and page D7 of the New York Times are all dedicated to articles on his recent win. The most interesting of the reports is the one about how the “French Blow the Coverage of Armstrong’s Big Finish.” With this being Lance’s 6th year in a row win of the Tour, you would think that the French media system would have planned for the coverage of his win. In the article they said that it was predicted from last year’s Tour that Lance would be the winner this year. So why are there only 10 seconds of the record book win? The excerpt from the New York Times reads,  “John Carter, OLN’s vice president of production, said not to blame his network, which was concluding its fourth year of Tour coverage. He said that OLN wanted to lay a cable along the Champs-Elysees to allow for live cameras to follow Armstrong to the finish line. The request was rejected by the French production outfit, Societe Francaise de Production, or S.F.P., which controlled the video feed transmitted by satellite around the world to networks like OLN. ‘The shut down everything on the Champs-Elysees for security and other reasons,’ Carter said by telephone yesterday from Paris. Throughout the Tour, OLN had augmented the French production with its own cameras. ‘We would have done anything we could have to get it done,’ he said. But when it mattered most, Carter said, OLN could not get what it needed.”  The whole entire tour and memories of Lance’s record book win are recorded, but the cross of the finish line, the most important part, is 10 seconds long.
