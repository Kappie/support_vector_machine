     
      my mom screamed at me.  reason: we have very different opinions as to my career moves.  she accepted it the other day. but she changed her mind. women sure are fickle.  but as much as i love her, i rather not spend my days in misery to humor her. i reckon i will outlive her afterall - by then, it doesnt matter any longer.
