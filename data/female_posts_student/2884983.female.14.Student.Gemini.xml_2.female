I think I will post the lyrics to Dismantle Me by The Distillers:  I fancy you  But I've been destitute  And all I know dissolved  I could never reundo you  I will always say tis so  I will always speak the truth  Descend into a noose  Could never reundo you  I want to bury you   Vultures circle around  Feathers float, wings flap, beats pound  And though my hearts exposed  I could never reundo you  I will always bled the truth  I will always speak  And know I was sent to cut you lose  I will never reundo you   It's warm and humid on Swanson Street  And the air is filled with electricity  And the sky is deeper than a dream  And the sky is deeper than a dream  Dismantle Me  Dismantle Me  Dismantle Me  And the sky is deeper than a dream  And the sky is deeper than a dream.
