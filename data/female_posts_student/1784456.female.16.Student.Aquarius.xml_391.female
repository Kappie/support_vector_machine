Lynne was going on about periods (just Lynne! *COUGH*) Then our maths teacher told us to be quiet, and he had gone bright red and we were all like "Umm" and then we all started laughing! Hehe, that was fun. Ok, so either my eyes are screwed or this has a really small font... eek! Then we had practise science SATs and they weren't about any thing that we had done and I had to use my brains and memory to work them out! (And relying on my brain power and memory I didn't get very far!) Oook, so Shrek tune going on in here... eek wierd song. Kind of sad but then again tacky (promise me you won't go into any sort of review business) Ok.... It's Rufus Waintright - Hallelujah. Wierd guy... listen to the lyrics, that's the bad thing about pop, the lyrics are crap and don't mean any thing. Yeah, but we all know that don't we! Some one mad this song saying "I know all the songs are crap" and I'm like wooooh! Sorry, it's that time of the year and I either go hyper or depressed! (Uhuh...) Poor blob... I feel sorry for her, if you don't know who I'm talking about and you actually care try checking the archives.
