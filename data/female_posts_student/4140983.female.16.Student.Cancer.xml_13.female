All of it. Which is strange, because I don't like messing with people but I like being the center of attention. I want to be noticed without having to DEAL with these people.  We bought raspberry Pop Tarts the other day, they're so good! I heated them up and they weren't too bad, but I think I like this kind cold better. Like, chocolate Pop Tarts, any kind, are SO GROSS heated. They should make like, a lemon cheesecake Pop Tart, with grahm cracker pastry and lemony filling. That would be awesome.  I made another bracelet last night. It's not as nice as my other two, because the bead I was forced into using for the clasp is a light gray while the rest of it is dark. It's not TOO bad, though. I'm going to make a red and black one to use some of the cool red crystals I bought.  I have to start thinking about what I'm getting Lauren for her birthday, I know it's in October and I'll have money then, but if it's possibly, I want to make her something nice. My plan was to get some thin black wool yarn and make a really nice scarf, but then I realized she lives in Arizona. So, with the extent of my skills, she's getting a necklace. :-P Problem: I see Lauren being very picky about jewelry, if she wears any. And I mean, I know it's "the thought that counts", but I'd really rather NOT have my skills DIE.  Speaking of crafting: WestFest. I have to decide NOW if I'll take that weekend off. I have to send in the forms, arrange the tent, and MOST of all, start making scarves. While I have a fair few, I don't have enough to fill up an entire space, and on top of that, I only have one West Fork scarve. That's not NEARLY enough. It's on a first come-first serve basis, but I know I'll get a spot. It's just a matter of if I want to take that weekend off. I think I will, because I'll probably make more selling than I will working.  I'm SO glad I don't have to work many hours anymore, but I'm only getting 70 dollars every two weeks. I'll probably have to give about 20 out of each check to insurance, and like 10 to gas. So that's 40 dollars every two weeks. When I first decided to cut back, I was thinking, WOW, 70 dollars! But now it seems like so little. Not a TERRIBLE deal, but I think I'll pick up a weeknight. Which means I have to kick in more for gas, but hey. And since my first check won't be NEARLY what it was going to be since I took this weekend off and missed out on 80 dollars, I should have just enough for contacts. But I think I'll get new shoes first, and some new clothes...I'm in desperate need. I'm sick of lame t-shirts that I've been wearing since 8th grade. I haven't had new school clothes since then. Besides, I don't need my contacts until like September 6, that's our first game. I can't wear my glasses because they make me look different and I'm mortally afraid I'll knock them off my face and they'll be trampled on. Drumline stops for no man. So I can save up for them.  I finally got smart and uploaded all the CDs I own onto my computer so I don't have to actually USE them unless I use my discman for practicing outside. My burner's shot or else I'd just burn everything again. Ooh, only in different orders to make the CDs more suitable for practicing. You know, slow stretchy songs, followed by songs with easy beats for drop spins, then fast-paced routine songs, then songs to practice stuff I'm SUPPOSED to be practicing, then slow songs to warm down and stretch again.  I love getting big long emails, even if my replies are inadequate...thanks, Dae and Lauren!
