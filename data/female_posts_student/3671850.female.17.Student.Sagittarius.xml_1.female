Thats enough to make me smile :)  Anyway, then i went to work my long shift of two hrs (slaved over the subs)  Oh, side note... I thought this was cute: A little, old man came in and wanted "Pro-ve-lony) cheese.. hehe.. ok.. had to be there.  I came home and then went out with my favorite people in the world.  And yes, I love u  all  the  same .  I love Jessica because she is my homegirl, my aundre, my sista, my roommate, my partner-in-crime, and my pretend lezi (when it comes in handy).  I love Nikol because she is my stir-fry, my "honest" friend, my love advisor, my cutex, the girl (ya kno, in X men), my (cheerleader-dance-buddy), and my identical twin. And I love Chad because he makes me smile, laugh, always cracks on the dawnut/dawnation/cookie daw/dwar, because he makes me happy, and he's my beefstew (no undertone intended). Ok, Ok thats enough LOVE for one day... Where is the love????? (BEP)  Wise words for the day: "Errrbody in the club love Cindy,  errrbody in the club love Cindddyyyy "
