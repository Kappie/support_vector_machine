Actually she n YJ is doing most of the project... sigh.. What can I do? YJ says she wants to use dreamweaver for presentation. Problem is I'm only familiar with front page! So she says she is going to get other ppl to do the job... I feel useless... Sigh...  Now I wanna talk about my best friend M... She is like an angel to me... Who never fails to influence me with her cheery and positive attitude.. There is no one who can bear to be down around you. You wouldn't allow that...  I think u can be a guru or muse u know.. hehez... Always able lifting people up from their sadness.. I have been taking the advice that you have been giving me.. And I'm cured from most of my pain.. When I am feeling sad, every conversation with you will start from tears and end with laughter. How do u do what you do?  Thank you gal.. You da gal~ Stay with me for life ya? =)  Black Eye Peas will be in Singapore on 25 may!!! And I only learnt about it after watching TV mobile on my way to Don's place! I can't afford to go!!! The pain! The pain of not being able to go! I love them! I adore them!! Argh!! Feels like an arm has been amputated!  Okie okie enough of my whining..  I woke up at 6.30 am, reached Don's place at 8.30am with breakfast. Cleaned up the whole room, gave him a massage too... I am learning to be a good gf.. Come on I should give myself credit.. I have always done stuff like that for him.. I only can hope he appreciates what I do...  D my ex msg me again yesterday at 2am for a chat! Haha.. as if i'll call him... 2am!! I do not care if he is lonely.. I'm not obliged to talk to him again.. After he has done me so much hurt in the past. I'm no saint!  Tomorrow is Mother's day!! I bought a nice meal for mom with a flower.. kept her company for the whole day... hehez... she seems to be happy... My brother's gf also bought her a bag. Ah... Everyone loves my mom... She is a great lady... hehe...   Anyway I pressurized Don into buying a present for his mom on mothers day.. He stopped buying pressies last year! So tml, I'm going to his place in the morning again.. And pry him out of the bed to go buy something for his mother... I wanna buy her something too because she cooks fantastic dinners for me all the time... Then I'll go home to my mummy again... I do not care if he is going to play mahjong tonight until 4 am... He better do something for his mom.. NO EXCUSES!  I just read YJ's blog and boy is she angry with A! She made alot of mistakes with her surveys.. And YJ totally blasted that girl to bits.. She cursed at A in her blog.. Now everyone knows.. Y? Y do things turn out like this? A said she didn't mean it.. Sigh.. Dun understand Y she made so much mistakes. Somehow I feel sorry for the whole thing.. I do not like situations like this.. Who does? But its inevitable... We are all humans! Not saints...    Take care blog...
