I was like hopping around squealing 'ow, ow, ow,' while trying to get dressed. And my lovely warm finger gloves are gone. Well one is at least. That's not good. If you leave at 7:15 in the morning just to get my 7:30 train. And its fucking so cold then. My hands are still half-numb from this morning because I couldn't wear my gloves. I mean, really, who would wear one single fucking glove?   Sticks and Stones.........and large heavy flying objects...   I am wierd. If you haven't noticed. GG called me an annoying bitch last night on MSN because I told her that I called her GG instead of Gigi. I was like, 'Lol, whatever!'  I find it funny when people swear. And when people insult me. Its just so fucking funny. Even as I speak Tash is sitting next to me totally telling HER laptop to fuck off. My laptops more messed than hers but *I* don't swear at it. Right now she's stomping her feet on the ground and screaming 'you cunt' at her Alex the Alligater game. I personally think it's totally lame, but you know. She's a midget. She's allowed to be lame.   Art Requests   I have like a million things to do for people. Like a million art requests. Really I should start doing commissions but the female parent won't let me. So anyway. I have this long list of stuff my friends want me to do.   Lotus Dragon   I finished this last night. IT started out as a random sketch but I liek how it turned out. It was originally going to be sitting in a little lotus flower and I decided to use a photo for that but I can't find a good one. So...yah.
