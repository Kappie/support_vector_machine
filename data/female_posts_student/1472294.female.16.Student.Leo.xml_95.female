Don't tell me all the sec 4's in our school so hardworking until they never blog?¡¿! Or they don't even know what is a blogger??? Anyway, the sec 3's blog are quite interesting and what sould I say, a little on the weird side? All of them are venting their fustrations of their teachers. I am not, coz people will know who am I.... That is so dangerous, I hope the sec 3's will not find out. I juz want my blog to be fun not to be the next conversation in school. Come on, I am still a secodary school girl, what's more can you expect???
