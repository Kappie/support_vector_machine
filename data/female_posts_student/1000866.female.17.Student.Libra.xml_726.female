I talked to Bryan and Matthew on the phone too. Ah, fun times. I like babysitting when you can put in a movie then put them to bed shortly after. Good times.   Tomorrow, I honestly don't know if I'll be doing anything. Maybe I'll go rent a movie and sit at home. I'd have the house to myself. It actually might be kind of nice.   Must be off to bed now.  Night kiddies.
