YAY what fun and after that we got that great idea of going to the driving range... hahaha disasterous... but fun, even my dad sucked at it... anyways that was my day... and i had fun and i also found out that during the storm last night a tornado went through waupun... yikes and my poor stepsister and her kids live there and her poor little son was so terrified that he cant eat or sleep... i feel so bad... yes well this entry was extremely boring but i am so excited about the weekend because tomorrow i am going to see fahrenheit 9/11 with my brother ahh im so excited and saturday mylittle sister turns 5 and we are taking a nice little trip to the wisconsin dells to mini golf and go on a horse drawn carriage into the carverns... YAY and then sunday i am either going to six flags or i am going to see my aunts and uncles because we are having a family meeting about our week long camping trip that is coming up soon... im so excited because maxipad might be able to come... hahaha (sorry max for calling you that) im funny!! yes well i am sure i will be back soon with more news of my stalker! yay and with other boring news about what i did in the past few days! ps... 8 days until dashboard confessional and i am practically pissing my pants because i am so excited and i might get to meet them!!!
