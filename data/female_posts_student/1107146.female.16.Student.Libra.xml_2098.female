This is (could be, who knows) an actual letter sent to a man named Ryan  DeVries by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, State of  Michigan.   Wait till you read this guy's response!   SUBJECT: DEQ File No.97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County Dear  Mr.  DeVries:   It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that  there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of  property.  You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor  who did the following unauthorized activity:   Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream  of Spring Pond.   A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  A  review of the department's files shows that no permits have been issued.  Therefore, the department has determined that this activity is in violation  of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and  Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being  sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compile Laws, annotated.   The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially  failed during a recent rain event, causing debris and flooding at downstream  locations.  We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and  cannot be permitted.  The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist  all activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow  condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the stream  channel.   All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 2002.   Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a  follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff.  Failure to comply  with this request or any further unauthorized activity on the site may result  in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate  and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter.   Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.   Sincerely, David L.  Price, District Representative Land and Water Management  Division ___________________________________________________   This is the actual response sent back:   Re: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County.   Dear Mr.  Price,   Your certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to.  I am the legal landowner but not the Contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson,  Michigan.  A couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of  constructing and maintaining two wood "debris" dams across the outlet stream  of my Spring Pond.  While I did not pay for, authorize, nor supervise their  dam project, I think they would be highly offended that you call their  skillful use of nature building materials "debris." I would like to challenge  your department to attempt to emulate their dam project any time and/or any  place you choose.  I believe I can safely state there is no way you could  ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity,  their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.   As to your request, I do not think the beavers are aware that they must first  fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity.  My first dam question to you is:   (1) Are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers?  or, (2)  do you require all beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam  request?   If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, through the  Freedom of Information Act, I request completed copies of all those other  applicable beaver dam permits that have been issued.  Perhaps we will see if  there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the  Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the PublicActs  of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws,  annotated.   I have several concerns.  My first concern is - aren't the beavers entitled  to legal representation?  The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute  and are unable to pay for said representation- so the State will have to  provide them with a dam lawyer.  The Department's dam concern that either one  or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing flooding is  proof that this is a natural ccurrence, which the Department is required to  protect.   In other words, we should leave the Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than  harass them and call their dam names.  If you want the stream "restored"to a  dam free-flow condition please contact the beavers, but if you are going to  arrest them, they obviously did not pay any attention to your dam letter;  they being unable to read English.   In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their  unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water  flows downstream.  They have more dam rights than I do to live and enjoy  Spring Pond.  If the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental  Protection lives up to its name, it should protect the natural resources  (Beavers) and the environment (Beavers' Dams.).   So, as far as the beavers and I are concerned, this dam case can be referred  for more elevated enforcement action right now.  Why wait until 1/31/2002?  The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then and there will be no  way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then.   In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention to a real  environmental quality (health) problem in the area.  It is the bears!  Bears  are actually defecating in our woods.  I definitely believe you should be  persecuting the defecating bears and leave the beavers alone.  If you are  going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step!  (The bears are not  careful where they dump!)   Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you  on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office.   Very truly yours, Ryan DeVries
