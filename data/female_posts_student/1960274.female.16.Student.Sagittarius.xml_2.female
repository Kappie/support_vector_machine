It was a VERY beneficial experince though.  I have learned so much through it.  Planning an activity like this one is really complicated.  I thought I had to have everything go as planned.  Well, it didn't.  Wednesday night, a few details weren't together, the schedule was a little off, and a few other minor details, and I freaked.  I was a wreck already.  It wasn't the best night.  Thank God for friends that care about me.  Then I wake up Friday morning to find out that it's pouring down rain.  Seeing as there was flooding, I was pretty sure the campout wouldn't happen, but I had no clue.  When I found out that we were staying at church and that it wasn't starting until 5:00, I was a basket case.  I had done all this work that I thought would go down the drain.  The schedules were completely wrong, the games wouldn't work, I was sure nothing would work out at all.  The SMITE team arrived at 11:30 to replan the trip.  It took me a really long time to get into the spirit of things, and when I tried to just enjoy myself I had so much fun, but for the majority of the time I was a crab.  I felt like I had nothing to do with the trip at all because all my stuff got cut, and my schedules didn't work.  I learned how inflexible and self centered I really am.  Unfortunately, I didn't treat some of my friends as well as I should have, and for that I am truly sorry.  I guess I'll have to chalk this one up as anther lesson I learned the hard way.  But even though nothing went according to schedule, it all worked out great and people had a blast!  I can't wait until next year, and I will not be making thoes mistakes again.  I had so much fun working with my SMITE friends and learned the value of team work and using your time well.  Alex, Joe, and Mike~ I had fun hanging out with you guys.  You're awesome guitar players! Hope I'm a good "manager" lol!  Eve, Angela, and Rebecca~ I know you don't realize this, but being around you guys always calmed me and made me enjoy myself.  Thanks!  Emily~ Thanks for always being there and letting me wear your shirts...lol  Amanda~ You helped me calm down and realize that everything was going to work.  Thanks for always being there for me to talk to and for cheering me up!  Robbie~ YEAH FBI TEAM CAPTAIN!!! I had fun working with you.  You were awesome!  Wilbo and Jaybo~ you two crack me up!! It wouldn't have been the same without you!  Nathan~ We'll have to talk--soon.  I'm sorry and thank you for everything.  Amanda and Courtney~ I had fun getting to know you better.  It was a blast!  Hopefully we all learned things from this that we can carry over to our Bahamas/Peru trip.  I can't wait!
