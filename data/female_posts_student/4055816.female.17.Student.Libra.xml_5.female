" sorry for everything. actually im attached. its juz tat my gf has always been givin me probs. but i dont want to be e one to break up wif her. But going out wif someone else is really unfair. so sorry. i really like u. but.. haiz,take care ok. "   My tears juz startedflowin instantly.. n i haf bn up since tat moment.. I am so heartbroken.. e one guy i truly loved was e one to hurt me e most,even more than anyone else ever didin e world.. he says its unfair to her ? but wat abt me ? dont i haf any feelings at all huh ? i wanted to call him names n juz scream n shout to let my anger out but i remained calm.. even tho i was hurtin so much inside n e pain was unbearable..   Does he tink tat by sayin sorry, its gn change e situation n make me feel better n forgive him.. does he tink tat e pain he caused me will go away juz like tat.. wat e hell.. e day went by in a blur.. kept myself bz,channelled my anger into playin netball n went to werk aft a long day in sch.. n here i am..   so, it was all a lie, one big stupid lie tat i fell for.. e reply i gave him was " hmm.. wat can i say ? my guess was rite all along. which is y i tried to stay away from u at e beginnin.. but it happened anyways. haiz, life is so unfair.. tis always happens to me anyways so wat e heck.. im juz screwed. ive got nothin else to say cept tat i wish ya all e best n tat ill see u around ya."---> talk abt calm.. a fren commented tat i sounded like as tho ive given up. she's rite,i have.   he's so cruel.. playin wif my heart,messing wif my heart.. if he didnt care for me, y lead me on in e first place.. i shud hf juz gone wif my instinct n stick wif e fact tat he had a girl.. but i took tat stupid risk n now im hurt once more.. im to blame for my own sorrow.. why did he lie to me, he cud haf juz bn honest..   damn.. so many thoughts juz runnin thru my head.. i wasnt interested in him at all but i eventually gave in n he won my heart.. but now he has shattered it to pieces.. my heart will nv mend.. maybe guys r juz a waste of time.. im sealing my heart away.. so numbed.. so jaded.. why play wif my heart ad if u meant to break it.. ive alreadi bn hurt so many times.. sometimes i wished id nv met u..  he made me feel so alive but now it feels like a part of me has died... its hard to let go of somethin so precious,close to your heart but i guess tats e way its gotta be..   Life does go on but im sure if i can... maybe im not meant to be loved.. maybe im juz not worthy of anybody..
