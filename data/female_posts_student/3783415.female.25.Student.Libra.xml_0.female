Since then I have been thinking that perhaps I am not the only one who would like to refresh/relearn/learn the basics of symbolic logic, (most specifically for me Language Q).  I have a few handouts from course work last summer, "Methods of Logic" by Quine and a collection of essays entitled "A Philosophical Companion to First-Order Logic" that I have yet to peruse, but nothing that qualifies as a true text.  Given the nature of formal logic, I feel that briefly going through a text or even comparing notes on internet research would be x-ceedingly beneficial.  Is anyone else interested in meeting as a class to go over logical rules and formats? -Rinn
