The order of God, the good pleasure of God, the will of God, the action of God, grace -- all these are one and the same thing in this life. Perfection is nothing else than the faithful cooperation of the soul with the work of God. This ultimate purpose of our life grows and increases in our souls secretly and without our knowledge." -don't know  "God has not abdicated His throne. He will not forever tolerate man's inhumanity to man. He sees, He knows, He understands--and He still reigns. Whatever has happened this day, whatever happens tomorrow, He is still in control. Nothing escapes His watchful eye and He promises to hear the prayers of His children. Let us look to the Lord, Who IS our help and our refuge in the time of storm. And while we pray for those who sorrow, let us also pray for those who hate...may God save their never-dying souls."  -Peggie C. Bohanon
