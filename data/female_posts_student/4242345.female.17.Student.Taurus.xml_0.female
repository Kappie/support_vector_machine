Another day to chat to George and wonder why were not together when we both *claim to* love eachother. Another day to dread the ever closer day when I get told of my failings.  I wonder if chatting to George is really such a good idea. The initial idea was that I still wanted to be there for him as a friend, as I do really love him and I know he could really use a friend who cares about him like I do and knows him as well as I do. It seemed so simple, just let the wounds heal and keep in touch as friends. Now it seems I'm just aggravating the wound without even giving it half a chance to heal. Like the old cliche of a scab that you cant stop picking although you know it only makes the wound take longer to heal. I keep needing to 'pick the scab', or in plainer terms I keep needing to call George.  should I cling on to memories of what 'we had' - or at least what I thought we had? Or should I just call it a day and get a big bandage to cover the whole thing. I mean I know that I could put it all out of my mind and focus on writing my personal statement or college work in a few weeks *shudder*. The problem is I don't REALLY want to let the wound heal. If it heals then things are really over. At the moment there is still a small hope that somehow things will change and I will get him back. This seems stupid after all he's put me through, especially as I cant even trust him in the slightest anymore. But as they say, love is blind I guess......  can people really change? Or are we trapped in our 'selves' forever? Are we bound to our fate regardless of our will to change? Or is it just that George doesn't really want to change?  personally I think that people can change, but only if they want to - not if someone else wants them to. I think that my disapproval of Georges behavior has very little influence in his chances of changing. I believe that the only way George will ever change is if he really believes what he does is wrong. Sadly, at the moment I don't think that he does believe this. I think any desire to change will be driven by the thought of getting me back, rather than being driven by the belief that his behavior is unacceptable.  so the question remains. Does chatting to him help? True it makes me feel better at the time, but it does just prolong the hurt and drag up all my emotions again. Its like I have the worst of both worlds. I don't get to feel loved and to hug him and tell him I love him, but I still feel sick when I find out he's chatting up girls or went to the cinema with some whore.  I think the only way I'm going to stay sane it to either take him back or to cut him out of my life completely. However I don't think I could really take either of these options. He lied too much and hurt me too much for me to take him back without any guarantee of change, and I love him too much to let him go. on the bright side, I think sanity is highly over rated anyway.
