But then they get old fast.   But anyway.  I was reading  urlLink VW 's most recent entry, and I decided to write my own thoughts about that. If it's sad for VW that her grandmother is having health problems, I can't even begin to imagine what it's like for VW's dad to see his parents like this. I guess my parents have been pretty lucky so far. My mom's mother had some minor heart problems awhile back, and my dad's father had surgery done on his heart a couple years ago...but generally, they seem to be in good health. It must be really depressing to get to the age when your parents start dying. Again, I couldn't imagine.
