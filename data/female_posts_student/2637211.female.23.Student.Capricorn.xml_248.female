I'm excited about it, and especially going with Melissa (my old college roommate) who is super-mellow and super-cool (I'm pretty sure she reads the blog). Then I'll spend Thursday driving back, thus taking advantage of my non-employed status fully. No more posting for a few days. I'll report on the trip when I get back.
