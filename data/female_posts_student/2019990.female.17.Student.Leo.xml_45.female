So I thought I would confide in my blog and see if that calms me down.     We begin, it was the last day of school (11th grade again).  But it was more like a last day of school in grade school, because we were all there, and we were all cleaning out our lockers. As I was cleaning out my locker, Leila came up, and we started talking.  I'm not quite sure what all was said, but then I suddenly realized where the conversation was heading, and asked her, Did you move to Bismarck?  She had.  I couldn't believe it.  I was super mad at her parents, and just didn't know what to do with myself.  I mean it was bad enough that all the seniors were leaving at the end of the summer, but now she was gone already.  So that put me down to a minute amount of friends for my senior year.     Then Leila had to leave to go somewhere else, before she headed back to Bismarck, and Mahinda (who was also in the conversation by the way) and I started to head to the parking lot to go home.  As we were leaving we passed by Mrs. Soliegaard, and she asked us what was wrong, but neither of us answered, and we just kept walking in a daze.     Then I was suddenly home, and I was talking to Wonder Woman, I told her that Leila moved, and then I started bawling. And I cried for a long time.  Then I woke up.    So first I have a query, if I can bawl in my dreams because of something that should make me bawl, does that remove some of the cold and soulless tendancies, or is it void because it was a dream?    Now a theory.  I think this dream is because most of my friends are leaving end of the summer, and I'm really afraid the other ones will leave me too, and then I'll have no friends again.  Because that has happened before.  In grade school I had two years, where I had about 13 friends move.  It was aweful.   I had dreams like this when Marika moved as well.  A few nights before she left, I dreamed that Leila was moving as well.  Here ends the musing of Amanda.  tune in next time for, why do the lids on pringles can pop up in the mountains? (this is especially for Mr. Chemistry man)   Ok, This is really long, and I'm running out of typing steam, so I'm going to try to go back to bed.  So goodnight to all, and none of you are allowed to leave, unless you have completed your senior year of high school.  Night Night.
