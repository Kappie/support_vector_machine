For once in my life I didn't panic or get nervous. I was clam. I don't know how I did it. It was a lot easier when your not freaked out and panicked. There was also LESS people in the comp room writing the essay, and less people in the gym. It made me feel not so cramped and more confortable. I didn't feel pressured or anything. I guess because it's summer I just relaxed and took it easy. My essay was the best thing ever. If anyone marks me bad on that thing I am going to have to kill someone. I know for a fact that it was good writing. Damn good writing. The multiple choice was a little difficult for me, but that is always to be expected with those tests. I find them a lot more difficult than the writing part. Anyways I am sure I did fine. Everything always works out. Just one way or another I always find a way. It was kind of strange during the multiple choice though. I wasn't sure if it was the lighting in the gym or my eyes or something. You know those questions that involve reading an except or quote, well when I was reading those it was hard to focus. The words would like "mix" togehter and it was hard to read it and understand it cause I couldn't make out what I was reading. It was like a blur of dark spots and I like blink excessively, which can be extremely annoying for like half a page of reading. If I just tried really hard to hold my eyes open without blinking, it was better. Except, it was hard to dom or something, cause it totally sucked. But whatever, it's over now and done with. It was probably just the lighting in the gym. Other than that I don't really know how to explain it.  I haven't had a lot of time to do one of my favorite things - write poetry. I don't really care if a lot of people don't like it, cause I do. I like it, and that is just me. Here's my most recent poem I wrote, I don't know if this one is half as good as any other ones I have written, but I guess I will still put it in my diary:     Tower Twelve    Alone at night I am left to fear Darkness of this night so queer For when I reach the watch of doom two arrows then unite as one  These hands they strike in the name of vein Forgotten solidarity is but yet contained For on this night I am to discover what remains This darkness has left me on the verge of insane  Cannot uncover a way to depart from this tower I am caught up in this daunting midnight hour Chasing stairs far beyond my reach Stumbling upon an appalling fatality in which my eyes do reveal  Before me lies a rusty board covered in such scarlet stains Flooded across the broken plank my eyes do not deceive And through the air such an awkward silence lingers Misplaced is this sense once so common to me, what shall I do next?  My breath becomes grave and my figure turns stiff As I look the rusted window I can hear such a riff The hands belt twelve and the sound hammers hard I remain in the tower of doom as two arrows become one  ~Vanessa
