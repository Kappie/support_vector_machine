Isn't it amazing how you can stay out all night partying, go to class the next day, and it not even phase you?  But, if you were actually doing something productive, then you feel like you're dying.  My dad sent me some really cool photos of "Things the news won't publish."  They're really touching pics of the "real American" soldiers in Iraq, the ones who are fighting for our country and who care about freedom.  Of course, you won't see these on a major CNN headline.  I had a great weekend in Cinci... I've attached a pic of my girls and I at the wedding. (by the way, I miss them so much... I am soooooooooooo ready to get the hell outta k-town!). Cinci was a blast, but I realized how ghetto downtown was when we were walking on the sidewalk and these two gangs were fist fighting right as we walked by.  Oh, yeah, and the Westin hotel staff probably thinks I'm the biggest idiot... they even recognized my voice when I called the front desk! I told them the wrong room name for the valet parking, the wrong number for the luggage, and then I kept calling down there wondering why in the world my luggage wasn't in the room.  Cheryl's wedding was gorgeous... open bar, beautiful Catholic church, and of course, all those adorable (and cocky) Italian boys.HMMMM... sounds like what my wedding's going to be like.  Also, there is a pic of my adorable little cousins and me.  They are so grown up!:( I love having a huge family... I found out over the weekend that my third cousin is an actor on a soap opera!  My cousin's neighbor is going to UT in the fall.  Of course, I tried to act so excited for him and talked like k-town was the best place on Earth.  Give me a break... I didn't want to scare the poor boy! Oh yeah, trying to find an apartment is a bitch.  My friends Jamie and Sus are moving in with me, and it is so hard to find something in the fort that we like. It will be a blast, though, just like 3's company.  Jamie, if you read this... Sus and I control the house!  Later, people... sleep is needed!
