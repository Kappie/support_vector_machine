Then we went to my places after that freakin two hours so i bought floss(lol pathetic) that's all cuz this isn't a place i like to be..i rather shop at orchard road which has more stuffs than at CP. The my mum went to wtf the lucky draw and guess wud if u spend $300 u'll get $5 voucher. DUMB! DUMB! DUMB! stupid right? i don't even knw why they give ONLY a $5 voucher after spending $300 not worth it at all. My mum bought a 'jubah' from hejab iran which cost $125 ..expensive for me. i could buy some shirts frm mango or somewhere with that   money.    my STUPID sis doesn't want to tell me how do i put a song into my BLOG. I HATE YOU!!!! I'll go to ur blog and never delete it in the history folder. muahaha!!! everyone go 2   urlLink  www.norizal.blogspot.com   ... her's and her nerdy boyfriend...    sign off,   diana
