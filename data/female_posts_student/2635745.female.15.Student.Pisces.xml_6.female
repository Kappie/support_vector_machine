That ride was pretty tame, considering who was in the car.  The competition was fun, I won two and lost one.  And everyone drank my lemon juice.  When we left I tripped when coming out the door and Ferrell kept imitating me and making fun of me.  Then on the ride home Ferrell asked if we could go to McDonald's so we did.  But before we got our food, Michael took my lemon juice and ran with it.  Then he threw it at a tree.  It was dented on the bottom and balanced on its side.  Then he took it and ran with it again this time he threw it over the fence.  Ferrell had to go to the bathroom then so he pissed outside of McDonald's.  We went inside to eat and then these two white gangsters came in and we thought they were going to rob the place.  We were like oh shit so we left.  Now we had to go to Kroger.  Why you ask?  Duh!  Michael threw my lemon juice over the fence.  So we get in there and Michael leans on me.  I tell him not to touch me so he rubs my back.  Then Ferrell tells him that he will give Michael ten bucks if he feels me up.  We bought the lemon juice and left.  We then went back to the school.  Ferrell left his large coke on the back of my car.  So I put it on his.  He threw it on the ground.  I picked it up and threw it at him from maybe a few yards away and hit him.  He picked it up and started chasing me.  I was in a skirt and heels and he could not catch up with me.  I slowed down though cuz it was killing my feet especially after chasing Michael in the McDonald's parking lot.  He was then about a foot away and he threw it and missed me by a mile.  I picked it up and threw it at Michael and hit him.  Then my mom drove Lindsay home and I got home.  Then Saturday came and Saturday was better than Friday.  We left Saturday morning and I talked to Matt and Lindsay on the bus.  When we got there Ferrell told me to watch my step because I tripped the night before.  We got in and Matt, Jacob, Lindsay, Paul, and I played poker.  Then we went to our rounds.  I didn't really see anyone until after third round.  So I got in their and Ferrell, Jake, and our HI people were in finals.  Then when they got out we had to wait about 2 hours in the cafeteria for awards to start.  Ferrell and Jake broke the 3nd place sweepstakes trophy but it was funny watching them try to put it back together.  Ferrell and I broght down the rest of the trophies and he put his arm around me and made a joke about something that had to do with masturbating and his left hand being stronger than his right with his left arm around me.  I backed off and yelled at him.  Then Jake came over and said that Ferrell was turning me into a guy.  Then Ferrell said so she's a guy but she likes guys but she's still a girl so it is okay.  And then Jake said so she's a gay faget.  Then I went to talk to Wes and Paul and Jacob.  Becca Weller and I were curious about what the big deal with breasts were.  Long Discussion.  And Becca suggested that Michael and I do a Duo next year about a saleslady who goes to this guys door and wont go away.  After he repeatedly trys to tell her to leave.  In the end she shoots him in the leg.  I thought it was appropriate.  Then when I spoke with Jacob, Jake, Ferrell, Michael and Paul.  Ferrell said that he bet Michael 500 dollars if he would have sex with me.  I pulled him aside and told him that sometimes he thinks his jokes are funny but this time he went over the line.  He was sorry and told me it wouldnt happen again.  And that he would think before he would say anything.  We then had to go back to school.  Ferrell, Lindsay, Jacob, Paul, Michael, and I al sang songs on the way home.  Ferrell said I love you Caitlin will you marry me and i said go to hell.  Then Jacob said he loved me.  It was so corny but it really felt great to be the center of attention.  When we got to Ruby Tuesday Ferrell, Michael, Jake, and this kid from BA walked over to Starbucks with me.  They got ice frappachinos (SP?).  And Jake asked me how much I weighed and then he and Michael called me bulimic.  The nerve.  And then they pretended to vomit in the bushes.  We were then seated at Ruby Tuesday and I sat next to Jake and across from Ferrell and diagonally from Michael and we sat in a booth.  We all got burgers but ever since I had a colossal burger it makes me nauseas and I cant eat their burgers.  We had fun at dinner but Michael offended the waitress and he put his mouth all the way around his cup.  Rob came later and got the four of us two tallcakes  he shared with Michael.  Ferrell, Jake and I had the other.  Ferrell let me have the rest when their was one bite left.  Jake turned to me and asked if he had anything on his tie or shirt.  He had chocolate on his shirt but he couldn't see it cuz it was by his neck so I had to wipe it off.  The others though had the waiter call Michael and Ferrell to the front desk because 2 girls were there for them.  When they left Rachel took his trophy and put it in the girls restroom.  He realized it was missing fifteen minutes later.  I told him I saw it at the front desk cuz they moved it and he covered for me cuz he was mad about them stealing it and gave me a hug.  I made alot of new friends this weekend and Rob told me he was proud of the work I was doing and Ferrell said he was too but that was only because I was prepared ahead of time and able to help him with his case.  wow my fingers hurt.  gotta go see everyone Tuesday.
