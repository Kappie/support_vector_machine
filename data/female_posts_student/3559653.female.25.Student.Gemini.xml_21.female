It was 31 degrees in Halifax today, which was fine at work because we're in the basement of the building and it was cool. BUT, the apartment was absolutely   scorching   when we got home! The air conditioner will definitely be going in this weekend! It's not supposed to be as hot but I am not taking any chances!  Not much news, though I did find out that I made the Dean's List for the Fall and Winter terms...YAY ME!!! I never thought I'd see the day but I am thrilled that my hard work paid off! It seems like a lot of things are going my way school-wise so I hope I can keep up the good work next year!  My birthday is a week from Friday and I am going to be the big 2-5...I can't believe it, I feel so old! I am going to try to get an outing on the go, get a bunch of friends and go downtown for some beers and a good time! I haven't done that for WAY too long so it should be fun! Hopefully I'll get lots of presents, or just a lot of free drinks. :)  Gotta try and hit the sack, I'm working a 12-hour day tomorrow and need some rest. I hope I can sleep in this grotesque heat! More later. :P  B.  Word of the Day:   Gragon (Gra-gon) : Though this isn't really a sookie word, it was derived by the sook himself. It's a combination of the words "Grumpy" and "Dragon"...kinda described how I felt as I was sweltering hot and suffering through the heat at the laundromat tonight!
