I really really want to change it to orange, but doing so would ruin my fabulous french manicure.  We took a trolley to prom. It was awesome, since we had a group of about 18 people. The trolley was wood and pretty old and kind of falling apart, but it was cheap and it was FUN. It had one of those cool dingy bell things and we got to ride out on the back of it and wave at people who were wondering why all these teenagers were dressed up and riding on a trolley.  My hair was biiiiiiiig. And I had an awesome date who is a good friend of mine. And i looked great. And I had fun dancing with people and it was just awesome.  But I realllllllly reallllllllly missed him, him, HIM, a lot. Especially since he didn't even go. And because it felt weird to dance with someone else. And because I bought that dress for his-and-my "future" prom a long time ago. And while my friends are bodacious, I think I'm still sad, especially in light of the past month's events.   And then he saw my pictures and didn't even tell me I looked pretty.  If you really want to know.
