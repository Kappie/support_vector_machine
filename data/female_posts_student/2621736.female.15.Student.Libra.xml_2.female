(after knoxville bella knows this really well.)so i clean up our forever filthy bonus room and the guest room closet. its a big walk in piled to the ceiling with a bunch of crap. it really took like the whole day. anyway my mom comes up and shes like. oh you cleaned. no smile no nothin. then she was like...you didnt vacuum the dvd or cd player right, idiot. wow. it made me sad. anyway, enough of that. ooh the premiere of I Love the 90's is on JULY 12th, not JUNE 12th. so if we get our air conditioner fixed, i'm gonna try and have everybody over. my grandparents are flying down on the 13th, so i'm not gonna be able to do too much after they get here. i miss em alot. i havent seen them in 2 years. plus we're goin outa town like every other week to Ohio and Canada and Oklahoma and stuff. But keep july the 12th open for me. hopefully we can grill and stuff. i'm excited about tomorrow. i think i might be going to this habitat for humanity thing with my dad and brother to help build a house. i hope i can go. anyway, i borrowed office space from a friend so i'm gonna go watch it. i cant believe i havent seen it before. heard it was like the best movie ever. i'll see yall monday i guess.  ps- lipton cold brew iced tea is the greatest thing EVER. pps- john mayer is a god.
