How do you get rid of these killing pains?  All this raging blood flowing through your veins?  Ask how did I get myself into this mess?  It’s like asking how I will fit my self into this dress.  Thinking why people care?  Wondering if God will ever answer your prayer.  Feeling so beautiful, looking to kill  No ones notices, there’s no thrill.  Take a look at the inside for that’s all that matters  The outside only shatters.  At the end of it all, these words just hang in thin air  People only tend to glare.
