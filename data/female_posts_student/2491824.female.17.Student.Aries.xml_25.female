Random thought!:  I want to open an independent music store around here...  ...Well, obviously not soon, but when I get in my mid-20s ...Oh yeah.    ...Why do I want to do this?... Because the only places to buy CDs around here are FYE and Wal-Mart!  ...Blargh...  ....I think the nearest one is around D.C... and I don't want to drive 75 minutes just to buy CDs...  ...Well, yeah I probably would... If I had my license, I'm sure I'd be driving there on a regular basis...
