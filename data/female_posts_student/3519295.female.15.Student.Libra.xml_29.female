MELANIE... is my best friend in the whole state! (lol, jk mel) has red hair...just like me! and I write eachother notes! ...except when we're randomly pissed off at eachother, which happens quite a bit. and I are super competitive. pretends to not have have very high self esteem, but she should, and i think she does. isn't very good at executing punch lines. jk; she tells good jokes. has WUNDERBAR! taste in boy-yoys. plays soccer. runs four miles on the treadmill every morning.  i have to go. I HATE SABANDA!
