(i'm trying to do that carrie bradshaw thing from sex and the city, only difference is her entries talk about sex and mine talks about gyrating plaque removers.) either way, i'm stuck with it for good now, and i no longer look forward to brushing my teeth.  oh, and as for the revo-hairbrush, yes, that many revolutions IS necessary!!
