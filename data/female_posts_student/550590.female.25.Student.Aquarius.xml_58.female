She's taking your response and posting them up on her office window as well as providing copies to anyone who would like to send an email themselves.  My mom was so thrilled...not only for your emails, but also because she finally figured out tonight how to make smiley faces on AIM.  A celebration was had by all...we're cheering for small victories at this point.  Apparently my email is getting around, too.  Mom got an email tonight from the woman who served as her travel agent when she and my dad were planning their honeymoon.  Speaking of honeymoons, Elyse Berger is getting married.  All bets are off on this one.  She, Aaryn and I thought for sure that I would be the 1st of the 3 to get married.  Looks like I'm gonna just have to settle for being a bridesmaid instead.  Not nearly as depressing as I thought it would be.  I'm not certain there's anyone in my life right now I would consider husband material, and I've certainly got bigger plans right now than finding a husband.  And speaking of plans...hmm...I'll probably wait until after this weekend to post this one.  If you want to know before then, ask me and I'll either tell you the truth or make up some really entertaining story.  After all, I'm a two-faced hypocritical backstabber...or so the potheads would have you believe.    But seriously, who's not two faced?  If you've ever answered "How are you" with "I'm good" when you were feeling shitty or talked about a friend or co-worker after making certain they were out of earshot, aren't you two faced?  Please, spare me the "you're such a horrible person and we don't like you" speeches, folks.  If you don't like me, quit reading my blog and don't talk to me anymore.  I assure you it won't bother me in the least bit. What does bother me are people who can talk shit but can't take it in return.  That and people that don't admit they're hypocrites.  We all are on some level.  The real hypocrites are those who can't admit it.  Anyway, thanks to those of you who wrote on my family's behalf.  Those of you who haven't, please take the five minutes to do so.  I've provided you with all the info you need on this site.  All you need is to point, click, cut, and paste.  Sweet dreams and goodnight.
