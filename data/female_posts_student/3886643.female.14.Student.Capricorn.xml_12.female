The lady had a freakish obsession with yellow....i have no clue why because her yellow shirt did nothing for her complexion and made her look fat.......but anyways we walked through this model apartment and everything was yellow ...the walls, the furniture, the bedspread, and almost every linen, and her shirt.  Psycho Yellow Freak ....anyways...after that we came home, then later we went to hanes to get me the shoes i wanted fer school. We went to Pacsun for the second time in a month and they didn't have my size in the awesome black and pink Etnies i wanted....Stupid Losers...so then we strutted next door to Finish Line where they always have my size. And we showed them the shoes i wanted and those stupid losers didn't have my second choice in my size. So Then we went to Lady Footlocker (Whata Great Store)...and THEY had my size in the awesomely kool dark grey and pink New Balances....So i got them, and this neat-o duffel bag, perfect for soccer (Yip-ee).............Thats about it, except i just saw this stupid add for windows.......*Buy 2 Windows, Get One Free!*....What The heck, if u buy two windows more than likely won't u need quite a few more, for instance if ur building a house.... i mean who needs 3 windows? That should be like cursed or something...Gah people these days...I'm So glad i made it through Friday The 13th Safe N Sound...haha...Actually somethin good did happen...i talked to the guy i like....but it's hard to guess who he is...seeing as i talked to about 25 peolpe last night.....about 15 being guys...haha...thats about it fer real.....right now im listenin to Get Tangled Up In Me, Whata Great Song...I recommend it go to launch.com and listen to it,it's great.
