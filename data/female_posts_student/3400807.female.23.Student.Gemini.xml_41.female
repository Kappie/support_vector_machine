Hey, go check this out:  urlLink Add-A-Line . It's something I've started. Head over there and give me the next line. :) You can either leave it in the comments section or e-mail me with it... I think I've got it set up to automatically post when you e-mail it to the first address listed at the top. I'm not positive, though, and it seems to object to e-mails that aren't plain text, so if you're an Outlook user and you have it set to html or something, it'll probably bounce back to you. I'm still learning... :) Anyway, I'm terribly excited about this! Please keep it relatively clean... but I can't wait to hear your ideas. Um, well, see them that is... :)
