I mean I guess Im just being selfish like everyone says I am and I guess if everyone is saying it then it must me true. But this is where its different. I stop everything in my life and I mean EVERYTHING to make this one person happy, only to find out that person won't do the same. Tomorrow is wednesday and well y'all wouldnt understand. Well this person decides to do stuff stay out late tonight and be gone all morning. When if I would have known I would have done the same, other than not doing the things that I had wanted to do. I guess thats what you get for being a nice person. You still end up looking like a jerk to someone I guess you could say. Which breaks my heart. But nobody knows it but me. I guess you cant always get what you want even if you're trying to please people. Well I just had to complain for a little while and Im sure Ill have some more complaining in the morning like I always do. Till then, Later Days
