       
      I spent Saturday driving through southeast Missouri--a bizarre moonscape of torn up highway and somewhat reclaimed farmland.  I watched a construction worker hose down the side of a newly built exit ramp with fertilizer and green food coloring, which gave the roadside scenery a surreal, art deco look to it.  Six hours, one Quarter Pounder, and a catnap in the Mountain Grove emergency room parking lot, I ended up back home in the cornfield.  I'm here now, awaiting The Big Day like a convict awaiting her final walk out of Death Row.  Cold feet?  And how.  In the meantime, I'm planning on being a Lady of Leisure.  I've given up trying to find a job that's willing to provide full time employment for six weeks and am focusing mainly on being very healthy and very helpful around the house.  I already have steaks marinating in the refridgerator and I've renewed my ironing duties with zeal.  I've also picked up the books I left here last time I came home.  I picked up  urlLink Nickel and Dimed  and finished it in two hours while I played sentry in the church nursery yesterday morning.  It, like  urlLink Fast Food Nation  filled me with moral repugnance and self-disgust for contributing to this blight, but again...what can we do about it?  How can you convince the wealthiest five percent of America (those who own Wal-Mart and McDonald's and, and, and...) to maybe fork over a tiny fraction of their net worth to give their employees a chance to maybe eat AND pay rent?  A letter writing campaign, maybe?  Stronger union organization in and around towns that support mega-stores?  Maybe a boycott of those companies? Communism? Somebody tell me and I'll be all over it. I hate myself for living right in the middle of poverty and being so ignorant about it at the same time.  I work $6.00 or $7.00/hour jobs on top of my regular one to afford my gym membership and pedicures for the wedding while people twice my age are working their two jobs to make the daily rates on a squalid motel room because they can't afford rental deposits for a real apartment. I'm disgusted with myself now...but again, how can you help out a struggling person if you end up putting yourself in danger of poverty, too?    I'm just whining and being ineffectual...enough. I'll remain, in the meantime, a Lady of Leisure in my cornfield.
