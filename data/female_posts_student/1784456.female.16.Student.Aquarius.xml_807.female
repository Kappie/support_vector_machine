Ok, so first we went for a long walk... into the middle of nowhere, like usual then we got covered in ants and walked back! Fun! Then we posed... and people stared (I was drinking ribena from a wine glass!) Scary huh? Oh, and yeah, it has a wine carrier on it! Mad! Just listening to Boy Hits Car, I'm totally gona! Woohooo! Hmm, some one didn't spike my drink did they? Mmm... so any way, then we walked up a big big hill! Soo steeeeep! Instead of going my way around, then we got stuck and had to leg it over a fence! Ooh, fun! Hmm, how was every one else's days? You're all on holiday! :'( It's just me! How depressing... and... boring! Hehe, you have to get back and save me from myself! Ahh... tomorrow = working for money so I can actually do some thing! (I've got 30p! 30!) Ok, bubi!
