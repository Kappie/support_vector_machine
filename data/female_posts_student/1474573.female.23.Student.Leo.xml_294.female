I happen to think I'm pretty darn funny yet many think I'm funny in the "shake your head - I cant believe she just did/said that" way of making someone laugh...  I kinda sorta disagreed, so I asked my oldest friend who's known me since I was six.  She also agreed with the "I can't believe she just did/said that" philosophy.  Hmm... maybe she's wrong too...   Then she points out the incident where I used nail polish remover on my face as an astringent.  NOT on purpose, of course...but yes, it's true...  Here's the story for all those already laughing and shaking their head in disbelief... I used to keep my  urlLink Sea Breeze  in one place on my dresser, the far right side.  My nail polish remover was always kept on the left side.  One day, my best friend and roommate at the time (what a mistake, but that's a different story...) decided to use the remover and put it back in the wrong place.  That said, one day we were just sitting and bullshitting in the house, and I went to my dresser to astringe.  Is that a word?  How about de-grease?  Ew, now I sound like an oven... Well you know what I mean...so I pull out the cotton ball and I dab the "Sea Breeze" on it and start wiping my face.  Here's how the conversation went from there:  Me:  Blah blah blah blah - sniff - sniff -  You doing your nails? Her: No...why? Me:  You don't smell that? Her: Nope. Yak yak yak.... Me:  Who the hell is doing their nails? Her: Maybe its the ghost. (giggle) [we did have one who used to make fried balogna sandwiches in her closet.] Me:  (Face burning - the lightbulb comes on...) OH MY GOD!  I'm going to die!! I'm BURNING!  It's MEEEEE!!!!  It's on my face!! Her: Falling down laughing hysterically Me:  Eyes watering, quickly runs to the bathroom to rinse face off.  So there you have it.  To this day it makes us both laugh hysterically!  (Totally cracking up right now!!)    Okay so maybe I am funny in a very odd way.  Siiigh.
