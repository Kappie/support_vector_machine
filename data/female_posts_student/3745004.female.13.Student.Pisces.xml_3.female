The air starts to get colder and yet somehow, more evilly delicious. You come to an ancient clearing showered with sliver from the full moon staring down at it, at you. Your skin prickles and you turn around. Bloody rotting corpses are hanging from each tree. Each body hung from organs strangled around their neck. They seem to be staring right at you. You run! Fast. But nothing could take the curse on you. Nothing will change you back. You start to go though a transformation. Your ears become long and pointed. Your K9 teeth become sharper and longer. As your nails grow great black wings burst the skin on your back.  Screaming in pain you keep running, right into a corpses hanging from a tree. It seems to put it's dead cold arms around you and not let go. Nothing could help you, nothing would save you. You shut your eyes trying to believe nothing is happening, the world is fine, but as soon as your eyes even slightly open you are still being held onto by the corpses. Turning back to the trees trying to break the grip your eyes grow even wider with fear. The whole forest is burning. The sky is alight with dancing flame. The corpses disappears as you try to run the other way only to find that you are blocked in. Trees fall ablaze to the ground starting the grass on fire. You can't get out. You will die and forever this evilly holy land will be your ashes grave. In your vain attempt to escape you leap into the heating air and your wings take flight. Higher and higher into the smoky air that's clogging your lungs.
