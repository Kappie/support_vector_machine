She's like, "oh, i'm so smart and everything, your dumb and have no right to be in my class!" Yeah right. Well, today was kinda fun. The only decent mall here is SM Manila, so that's where I usually hang-out. I was feeling kind of down today, so I went shopping! Gosh, Php400 a day is not enough! I can't be expected to buy from sales! God, I really have to slim down!    I didn't attend my P.E. class today, so what? I hate softball. I just have so many things on my mind right now. I think i'll go shopping again...
