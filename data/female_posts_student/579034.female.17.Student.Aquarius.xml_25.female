AHHH too much stuff to do!!!! CCD should be a nice thing though.. I love kids, I just got my assignment sheet thing. I'll be doing Tuesday, Room O again, 4th grade... they are so cute.. this year I'm getting on top of when they have vacations and stuff and I'm throwing them a big party cause my last years class didnt get anything cause the teacher was a like CCD Nazi.. this year will be cool though and next year (I hope I hope I hope) I'll be teaching so.. that will be good... and I'm actually GETTING chem! It's not as bad as I thought... well, maybe I should wait... don't wanna jinx it or anything...
