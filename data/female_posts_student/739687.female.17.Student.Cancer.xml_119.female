Manda: No, actually I'm talking about a.....*keeps writing...pauses...looks up*.....Yes I am.  Bah...owned. Anyways, I don't like Mr. Babcock. In fact, I despise that favoritistic little jerk! If I don't move up soon, I'm going to hafta quit, he's that bad. And then he threatens to move people down...humm...he's talking to trumpets.......who is (unfairly) last chair? me. He even thinks about doing something that dumb, and I'll quit on the spot. I enjoy playing, but band isn't fun. It's lost it's enjoyment. And it's just not worth it to stay in if I'm miserable. And I do mean  miserable.   On another note, World History=class of death and such.  Bye bye crazies!
