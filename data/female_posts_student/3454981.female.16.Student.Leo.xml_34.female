Not enough people know about them so there was probably at most, I'd say 35 people but only about 25 were close to the stage. This enabled me to get to about where the 2nd or 3rd row would be, had there been seating. I could have gotten closer, but I realized that they would be able to see me best from the 2nd or 3rd row area and I was right :) Justin saw me and waved (and later on winked! I guess I was smiling a lot) :) And Logan saw me and pointed and winked ;) After the concert I had them all sign a T-shirt that said "THE REDWALLS" on it and it was really fun. Ben (the drummer) was dripping with so much sweat and his hands were shaking but he managed to sign it just fine. Andrew (guitar, some vocals) signed it and has a cool signature. Then I went over to Logan and he was sitting down at a table and when I had him sign it, he winked and said "here you go, my dear." and smiled. I almost died :D LOL only because my friend was VERY jealous because he didn't say anything to ANYONE else but me :D idk it made me feel special because all the girls there were wearing clothing that was far too revealing and I was the only one there in a T-shirt and jeans who wasn't actually expecting attention. That never happens because I am usually the "ugly one" according to some rather rude people. People say I have very pretty eyes and very white skin and very dark hair (yes, the cartoon character I am most similar too is Snow White) but then they're all just trying to get to my older sister who is a blue-eyed tanned-skin brunette lifeguard. Yeah, I am generally cast in her shadow because we are nearly exact opposites. But this time she wasn't with me so I was not being compared :) There have been very few times in my life that I have felt pretty or at least that my personality was "good enough" to actually be noticed. I kind of like that feeling. But anyway, so many tangents....so little time. Hmmm...I'll have to make that into a T-shirt some day... But overall today I was having a very bad day until I went to the concert. And now I feel somewhat special, so I think I shall go off and dwell on pleasant thoughts.  *sigh*
