One last time before we Say goodbye try not to cry It's time for us to just move on we'll be fine Let me get lost in your eyes just one last time before we say goodbye   Oh so beautiful! Why I'm saying goodbye to this blog is due to school related reasons. I think you all should know it's the OOOOs. Hehehe. Goodbye dear sonority! =D
