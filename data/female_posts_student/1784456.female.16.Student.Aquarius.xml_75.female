Yeah! and uh....trying to decide what colour to paint your wall! ok i'm yalking rubbish now aren't i? An orange world would be kind of good though if you think about it cos you wouldn't have to remember all the different names of different types of fruit because they'd just all be oranges. But that would be kind of bad actually cos you wouldnt be able to tell fruit polos apart - you'd just have to guess when you took one out of a packet whether or not it's an orange one, cos you might think it was a purple and it would end up being a gross-tasting orange which could get a little annoying. But on the other hand, if the world was blue you wouldn't be able to tell the ground from the sky and you might end up walking upside down. But- if the world was green that would be really god because you could eat all your favourite foods and you wouldn't have to eat green vegetables because all the other foods would be green - wow! That would be so cool- if your mum told you to eat your greens up you could go and eat a bar of green chocolate instead. but that ould kind of backfire because we'd all be  grossley unhealthy.
