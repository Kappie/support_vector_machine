I had the kids party and family came over.  Time well spent and good food.  Mo got a  Web blaster  and the can of 'webs' lasted a whopping ten seconds.  So now mom needs to get refills so he can squirt webs all over the house.  Sophia got dress up clothes and a Birthday Barbie.  They both got clothes also.  Highlight of the day was their bikes from grandma and papa.  Spiderman bike for Mo and a Disney Princess bike for Sokie.  All the rain made it rough to ride yesterday, so today seems like it will be filled with a lot of hours outside.  Pool sounds good too.   Sports Wrapup  Last game of the 3 game series of crosstown traffic-Cubs and White Sox.  Cubs already had two wins, and as my brother and I watched bits and pieces of last nights game, we thought it could go either way.  Getting dark outside, the kids wanted to see fireworks.  So we headed outside and took part in all the 'ohhhs and ahhhhs' that seem to accompany fire.  Going back and forth to check on the score of the game, it  urlLink finally ended  with a White Sox pitcher who choked on a 3-2 count.  The crowd at Wrigley went nuts.  The night ended in Cubbie fan favor.  Cubs 2~White Sox 1.   Local News.   urlLink This kid .  18 years old.  He was driving in his pickup truck and hit two 15 year olds on a moped.  His toxicology reports found marijuana in his blood.  He will be charged with two class D felony counts.  The article states that if he was 21 he could face tougher charges.  I thought that 18 meant you were an adult?  Why does it matter if he was 18 or 21?  Another thing is, the court doesn't have to prove he smoked before the accident, THC stays in the blood and fat tissue sometimes up to 30 days.  So whether he smoked that night or last month, it is still going against him.  Read it and decide for yourself.   peace.love.dmb.
