The eerie part is that I have had my first completely sleepless night. Sure, I've pulled all-nighters, but none of those all nighters occurred while I lay in my bed attempting to sleep. See, my all-nighters were either typical church lock-in or college fare. This is some weird adulthood sleepless night and quite frankly, it's freaking me out.       The lock-in/slumber party all-nighters were never a problem for me. I was always the girl that could really pull off that whole not sleeping thing. I was also the girl who dug in the luggage of the sleeper, pulled out a bra and panties, soaked them down in water, stuck in 'em in a plastic bag and then opened the freezer. I was the girl who made enemies at slumber parties and felt absolutely no shame. Lock-ins were never big sleeping events for me, either. I think it had to do with two fundamental problems: social butterfly syndrome and idonotsleeponfloorsitis.  It's pretty simple, really. When I have friends around, I won't sleep. I'll just stay up and giggle, flirt, tell wild stories and never miss the sleep. Also, I don't sleep on floors. I mean, sure, I'm sure I could, but I always believed it was useless to put my body through such torture when I could fall into my own bed, exhausted, at 9 AM. After all, anyone who has ever pulled an all-nighter would agree that the best sleep comes with pure exhaustion.       College all-nighters were not so different, only cooler. I loved and mastered the art of not sleeping in college. My freshman year was filled with all-nighters; my mother worried, but she was sure I'd outgrow my passion for all-nighters by the middle of the first semester. That didn't really happen. I did eventually start sleeping, but the majority of that sleep occurred during the daytime hours between my last class of the day and supper. Then, after supper we would begin our "day." It was awesome. My sophomore year was quite similar, as my roommate was a night owl and we would have a blast sitting up drinking Tallsups (that's coke, people) and singing never ended renditions of "Sing and Be Happy." We were both altos, so we'd take turns on the parts. There were also more memorable specific all-nighters.  One great example is election night 2000. I had an incredible election party with a ton of friends and even a professor. I figured they'd all be out by 1, and the ones that lingered until that time would be the talkers. However, my first guests began leaving at 2 and the last guest left at 6. See, we had no idea what was in store for the American people and we had this pipe dream that Florida would somehow have their butterfly ballots and general incompetencies sorted out by 6 AM. We were wrong. Clean-up in the kitchen lasted until around 7:15 and the snow had begun falling at 7. I don't drive in snow, so I skipped class and caught up on my sleep that morning.       Tonight's all-nighter is not even comparable to the all-nighters of my youth. Those were intentional. This one is completely accidental and totally frustrating. Because I am leaving for Six Flags at 6:30, I rolled my sleepless, energy charged body out of my bed at 5:30, deciding that minutes of sleep would only make me tired. Now I can keep myself awake by worrying that falling asleep on the Titan will cause my neck to snap in two. This could be the beginning (or middle?) of a very interesting day.
