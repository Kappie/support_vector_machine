I think it's amazingly stupid and I am fucking sick of it! I really like it when you don't even invite me. (Not when it's just them and their bf's but other things) "I haven't seen her in four days though" umm yeah live with it fucker. I hate this shit. I hope she doesn't expect to come back. I'm going to lock the door, and leave a note for her to stay at Ashlyn's. That is fucking shit. Well I'm going to bed soon.  Tomorrow is my last day here for the rest of the summer until September. I can't wait to leave. I'm tired of this fucking shit. People in Florence are stupid, that includes my friends *except Felicia* Earlier Suzy and I were talking about how you have to look at the positive things in every relationship, I've learned a lot of things in my last couple of relationships, I learned some good things and some bad things. I learned that it's okay to take risks, and also that you can't put all of your trust in anyone. I won't do that again and I'm not about to forgive and forget. Daril said something amazinly brilliant the other day, I'm not sure if I already talked about this in my blog or not earlier. A dating relationship can only go as far after the relationship as before it. If you are great friends before than you can be jgreat friends afterwards, if you aren't friends and you meet and start fooling around then afterwards you probably won't be very good friends and end up just fooling around some more afterwards. Okay friends will be okay friends, and what not.   Well that's all for me for now! Ciao until later. I probably won't be posting regularly for the next month or so, I will whenever I can get to a computer.
