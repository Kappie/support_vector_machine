I haven’t seen him since Christmas, and even then we were both very sick so our visit wasn’t really one of the best we could have had. I haven’t really talked to Jesse much but with his phone acting up that can be expected. They ran a really interesting article in the local paper on Sunday about the 319th and some training they have been undergoing to help them be better prepared for a convoy attack, if you have been listening to the news lately that is all they have really been talking about (Convoy attacks). I am very relieved that the ARMY is taking the time to train our soldiers on this because they have admitted to sending the first group over there unprepared. The article was a big slap in the face for me. I also got a chance to see a really interesting documentary call “True Life” which airs on MTV. I watched an episode, which happened to be titled, “My Life in Iraq” which followed a soldier and a few residents of Kuwait.  I have never watched this show so naturally curiosity got the best of me and I watched it. It was really interesting to see the views that were portrayed and to get a few insights as to how soldiers are dealing with being over there. Unfortunately this show portrays a different topic an episode but who knows maybe they will rerun that episode, so I can tape it. I think if they continue to runs episodes based in Iraq people would watch, I know I would.
