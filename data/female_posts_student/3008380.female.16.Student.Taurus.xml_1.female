I got up to pick up some pop from my grandma. And then I got back on my computer. I live such an amazing life, I don't know how I keep up with everything.  I was supposed to go with Joel today out to the interstate lake, but then something came up so we couldn't. I'm disappointed, but oh well, life goes on. I just wish I hadn't basically bribed my mom into letting me go, and cleaned my entire room just so I could go, if I ended up not being able to.   So, today sorta sucked. I don't like my hair much. She said the curl should relax, and it better, or heads are going to roll.
