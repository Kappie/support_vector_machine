I've been reading past journal entries of Joe's and I can't understand why I was drawn to him.  Sure he is good looking, but he is very cocky.  Who knows?  I think I'm starting to like Nick...which could lead to some good things.  However, I need to figure out what ol' Andy is thinking about "us", because I don't want to mess our friendship up.
