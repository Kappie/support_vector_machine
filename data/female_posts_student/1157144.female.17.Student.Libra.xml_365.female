Maggie we still need to see the cowboy bebop movie, BY THE BY.  oh, what else... oh yea, New York = such an awesome place, we all should venture there someday, it would rock the casbah ten times harder than shareef likes it. Annnnd... i bought my prom dress too! muahahah!  If you have been to Macy's and seen this pink dress, it's strapless and goes somewhat past the knees but not all the way, and the top has horizontal folds of tulle, and then below the waist is vertical folds, and it has a ribbon? well it's basically jsut like that, except periwinkle. I can't describe it without making it sound like a lampshade, but i swear it's not! Also, I think i saw Beth's dress but i wasn't sure... Beth, does your lace part have little polkadot type things on it?
