I already know that I struggle even with the most basic functions in math, but this girl must have thought I was a total retard.  I can't shake the feeling of stupidness. All my life I have struggled with this stupid dialexia (spelling?) feeling in math. It's silly but even the most simply additions stump me and I need to be left alone otherwise I get nervous and mess up even more. That happened today. It's hard not to feel that way, since I fought that helpless feeling in high school and had to battle the constantfeeling of stupidness. I hope I can do this...  I don't want to give up or quit, I know I need to give myself some breathing room to make mistakes but I still don't have to like it...Until then...
