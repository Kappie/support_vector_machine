(that was directed to someone)  never do somethun that u know u shudnt be doing, if ure going through shit there is ALWAYS someone thats going through more shit than you.. if ure thinking of doing somethun bad think of the consequences.. "permanent solutions for temporary problems" does not solve anything..and it never will. why are u bringing ureself down into ure own shit hole when eventually ull have to come back up for air.. why are u taking ureself down to hell and why are u leaving ure life behind. u cant do that u just cant leave behind somethung and hope to start soemthin fresh. u gotta finish the shity life u have now. dont leave us behind and dont leave the friends that care. because truely even when assholes are being asses to u u still have those who truely do care. dont run away and dont leave. i dont care if ure a shithead, i dont care if uve exposed me to shit, i dont care if ure fugly, i dont care if u suck @ life, i really dont care just dont leave.  that i care.
