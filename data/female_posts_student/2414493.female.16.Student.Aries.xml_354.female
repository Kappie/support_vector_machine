I've just returned from a meeting with Beth, the lit TA, and I'm really lost on this thesis for the lit paper. Michael, the confident, opinionated to-be med student was right before me and it was obvious that he had a much better idea of what he was doing: he had a thesis and outline and everything, while I had nothing. I sat down, and placed a blue pen and Proust on the table. Miserable.  I just  need  to think of something powerfully insightful. It's not going to be any good anymore presenting piddling little statements, repeating the opinions of other people. I'm not angry. In fact, as I was getting up from my chair in Starbucks I just wanted to cry, it was that pathetic. But I didn't. I don't think the occasion  really warranted that kind of desperation.   Now that I'm three weeks in, I have to take seriously that there  are some amazing people here, and they're going to trample me down if I don't manage to buoy myself up. There's always going to be someone more intelligent, more opinionated, more successful than I am, and now the question is, how do I deal with it? Counterattack.  I'm just not happy right now. I need to find some way to assert that I'm  doing  something, and doing it well enough to rank among this foreign group of peers.
