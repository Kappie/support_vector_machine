I'm so sick of this.  So my grumpy mood started when I went to this concert. The object of my affection sings and plays the guitar. He's  20 years old ... I'm 16. I've never talked to him. He has the voice of an angel and he's amazing on guitar. He also seems to be so cool, he has such a cool style and he also has a girlfriend.  I first noticed him because he works at my favorite coffee shop. Whenever he serves me anything I'm grinning from ear to ear. I'm such a teenager! ARGH! I'm so mad at myself for being so pathetic.  Anyways, so I went to that concert, and I drank alcohol for the first time in my life. (If you cout sips of champagne out.) So I was all tipsy and I drank beer, which I hate and my best friend smoked. Which was kind of hard for me to deal with cause I never thought of her like that. But most of all, I never thought of me like this. Drinking. It's not me. I'm the responsible one, the smart one with plans and a future. I'm not one of those girls.  But Saturday night,  I was .  And of course I got a bad conscience. So I told my parents that I drank. Of course I didn't dare to tell them exactly what I drank, so I made that up a little when they asked. But I just had to tell them, no matter how scared I was of doing just that. I'm such a goody-goody! Now that's annoying me! God, there's no way to be with out me annoying myself! GOD!  And I'm still confused about my choice of school for this fall. I chose to go to Media-school. Cause I want to be a journalist. But then I thought of going to a music-school cause I love singing.  And I don't know if I've confused my dreams with what I should want. If maybe I'm not so good at writing even though people tell me that. Maybe I'm not meant to do any of it. Maybe I'm supposed to be a counselor or a teacher.  What do I know!?   I'm extremely confused, and my head aches.   This is it for me. I hope no one reads this, for their own sake.   *sighs*    Elin       Read the first chapter of my  urlLink story ... and please review! I forgot to put in an Author's note.. I'll do that in the next chapter!
