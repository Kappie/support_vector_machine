It's one of mom's old dresses that she wore to a Mardi gras ball. i had to line the zipper in the back with little safety pins and then string some yarn through the holes, and i;m not sure what I'll do about the halter part of it... Probably just tuck it in and pray, but I'm positive they didn't have halters in 1550, so i can't leave it like that.  as this whole monologue thing approaches I'm getting a little nervous. Not in a bad way, just the minimum amount of nervousness any normal human being has. I'll be glad when it's all said and done. But i do get to miss school all day. Except ((OF COURSE)) French, which is my last hour and morehead already told us we wouldn't have time to change clothes so I'll be in French and on the bus in this freaking poofy dress. jeez.  been talking to amelie. She's cool. She knows who metric is. i think she left me a comment yesterday.  ((w00t w00t))  i just dropped a crumb in my orange juice. That's funny.  i love orange juice.  I'm getting SO good at playing leads, you guys should hear me.
