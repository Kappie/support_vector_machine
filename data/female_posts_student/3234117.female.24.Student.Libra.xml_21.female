I try to keep these impulses to myself because everytime I mention getting a puppy I'm never met with positive feedback.  Well, rarely I should say because the idea of getting a puppy sounded very good to my sister.  I doubt she knew she'd have to take care of it though.  She wants to be a vet anyway, so I figure she needs some practice.  Okay well we went to see this puppy in a real shady part of Dallas.  It was so bad, I really didn't want to get out of car and wished I had one of those clubs on my steering wheel.  We did get out though.  So we get to door and on this person's door is a sign that says, we live in a pacific environment, please come in, remove your shoes and stay awhile.  I never took my shoes off nor did my sister.  To go on with the story, we see the puppy, it's a chihuahua (however you spell it) that has the same markings of a rotweiller.  It was the cutest puppy, very unlike the owner.  The owner as well as the neighborhood, was also pretty shady.  So shady that we got kind of scared when he went back around the corner somewhere in his house, came back and shut the door and his shades in the room we were sitting in.  Now we should've got up and left, but being naive I guess we stayed and played with the puppy.  It just kept getting stranger though.  The owner said he was a retired federal police officer which is maybe why I stayed although he could've been lying.  I figured he wouldn't kill us anyway.  Well he goes on and talks about the dog, how they are so easy to train and while he is saying this, his older grown-up dog pees on the carpet.  How ironic! My sister and I just watched this other dog peeing, but the owner did not say anything about it.  On top of that, he kept putting the dogs paws in his mouth and it was not a pretty sight.  Needless to say, we did not end up getting the dog as I felt something just wasn't right with the whole scenario.  I also realized, maybe I shouldn't get a dog afterall.  Maybe a cat!
