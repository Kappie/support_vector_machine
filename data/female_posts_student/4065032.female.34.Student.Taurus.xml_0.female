Why get up early with nothing of importance on the agenda?  When my back could no longer handle the comforts of the bed, I stumbled out of the room and began the morning routine. I showered, brushed my teeth, got dressed, popped open a can of diet coke, grabbed a cigarette and quietly went outside. The morning smoking session was usually when I saw the most action at the swallow nest. Then I froze, turned statuesque right there in front of the door. The nest was empty.  For some reason, I couldn't believe it. Maybe there was still a baby in the bottom. Once I finally accepted that the nest was empty, I quickly, almost in a panic, scanned the yard for the young ones. Nothing. Just like that, my family was gone.  I sat in the chair, which was warmed by the sun, and smoked my nicotine breakfast. It seemed as though nature was silent and still, waiting for me to catch up with what had happened. Finally, I started to look around, really look, for the family. I think they had perched themselves in the swampy grass several yards away from me; a pair of adult swallows would swoop through the "wetlands," and near a particularly large clump of Brown-Eyed Susans came a loud, energy draining squeak, squeak, squeak.  I spent most of the day waiting for the babies to come back home, like the first one who took flight the day before. In the afternoon, as if to tell me that everything was fine, an adult did the traditional loop into my deck space and gave me a quick tweet. Perhaps they knew that I wasn't a fan of good-byes.  At one point, late in the day, a baby came flying by the nest. I thought it would go right in there, but an adult was close behind, poking at it and delivering some kind of advice. I suspect it was something like, "Don't you dare go back in that nest." The two "J"ed their way back to tall grass where I lost sight of them.  During the evening walk with the dog, a very large bird flew over the top of us. I stopped and watched it in amazement. Was it a duck? No, too big for a duck. Was it a Great Blue Heron? No, wrong shape for a Heron. Maybe a goose. Then it occurred to me (almost bringing a tear and a smile), my swallows were really gone, and I missed them.  Perhaps the last of the bird lessons:  Missing the morning hours is not always the best choice.  Sometimes, as hard as it is, parents must urge their young to leave the nest and encourage them to not return.  Even though you've learned to fly, it doesn't mean you can't squeak at your parents for help.
