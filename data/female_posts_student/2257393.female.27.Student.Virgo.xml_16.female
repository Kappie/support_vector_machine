 have you been out of the country recently?  do you have any prior history of seizures?  do you abuse drugs or alcohol?  have you hit your head recently?  the answer to all of the questions was no.  this all came completely out of the blue.    i was able to tell more people, and asked them to make some calls.  friends came to hang out in the evening.  i called my friend jessie.  our phone conversation went like this: emily:  hey, um, so, i had a couple of seizures and i'm in the hospital now.  there's something in my brain. jessie:  what?  which hospital? emily:  graduate jessie:  i'll be there this afternoon.   and she was--took the train down from new york and stayed for two nights.  took care of the dog and cats at night while stean stayed in the hospital with me.    i was scheduled for a biopsy for midday on friday.  brain surgery.  they'd put some sort of metal halo on my head and use a CT scan to set the exact coordinates for the drill to put a small hole in my skull, into which a small blunt needle would be inserted that would push the healthy brain tissue aside and puncture the unwelcome mass.  then they would extract cells from the mass--if they got liquid, it's a relatively easy fix and everybody's happy.  if they don't, then we start to have more serious conversations.  early that morning i had the last of my tests done, a CT scan of my chest, which, like the scan of my abdomen and pelvis, was totally free of disease.  this was a good sign, because it meant that there was no cancer elsewhere in my body that could have metastasized into my brain.  i was hopeful that i'd get out of this experience with nothing worse than a small bald patch as a souvenir of the biopsy.  when the time came for the biopsy, my neurosurgeon (my neurosurgeon?!) asked me who i wanted him talk to after the procedure.  i appointed stean and jessie and our friend joe.  they rolled me into the operating room and i met the anesthesiologist and everyone who would be involved in the procedure, then they put me to sleep.  i woke up with the halo on my head, en route to CT scan again.  i remember the whole episode--i couldn't move at all because of my giant metal headgear.  i had the scan, they took me back to the OR, i had just enough time to start getting nervous about the procedure before the anesthesiologist did his magic and i was out.      when i woke up, the halo was gone, my head felt dull and throbbed slightly, all was blurry (i didn't have my glasses with me), and one of the residents was there saying, "emily?  everything went well, but it wasn't an abscess--we didn't get fluid."
