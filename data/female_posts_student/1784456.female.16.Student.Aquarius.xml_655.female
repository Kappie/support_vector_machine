Cause my teeth are really weird, and he had to shape some of them and fill them so that food doesn't get really stuck :( and they're ok now! Only prob is, the anesthetic lasts for erm, 3 hours, so basically one side of my mouth is totally numb and i can't actually move it! It's also affecting my nose! Eww this is pretty wierd. Right I haven't finished but I'm gonna post this anyway cos I know my computer will crash any moment now...
