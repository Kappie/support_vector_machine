It's so strange though, I read, researched, and watched everything possible about this surgery; Always hoping and wishing that someday I'd have it done -- And now I'm on the other side where the grass is suppose to be greener.  I'm not so sure that its greener but I do know its a hell of a lot harder dealing with life afterwards. I've always used food as a comfort thing and now it's no longer there -- It's not allowed to be there. In a way, food is like an evil best friend that hopefully, I've gotten rid of forever. However, it'll be tough... very tough but I think I can get through with it.  I WILL get through it! :-)
