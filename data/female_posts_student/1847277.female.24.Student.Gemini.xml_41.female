I mean, last year when I lived with Matt I was definitely not so attached to IM.  And since Dave's lady friend is visiting him and B-rat is in LA for a conference, I'm down to Calvin for the evening, and if he is even around, he will no doubt tire of my relentless babble.  I haven't ranted about not getting email lately, so: RANT RANT RANT.  I was admittedly slacking on my email there for awhile, but early last week I emailed everyone that I owed messages to and have only gotten one reply for ten emails sent out.  Boo on that.    Nowadays I do pretty well with the self-esteem, but when people don't email or poke fun in the wrong way, I start to revert to overly sensitive/self-conscious Jamie, and I feel like no one really likes me but just puts up with me because I won't go away.  I hate feeling that way, because I know it's dumb.  But you can't always control the way you feel.  I mean, when you deal with being made fun of throughout childhood/adolescence, it's not unusual to have definite self-esteem issues.  And I did, for a long time.  But during college I feel like I got over most of that, and sometimes I'm really good at not giving a shit what people think about me.  I wish now were one of those times.
