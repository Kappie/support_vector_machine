I went to get a second piece though, I took the first bite then this commercial came on T.V.withthese kids saying how they were called so fatand they were sad, then SUBWAY opened their eyes, they were like 10 and they had lost weight by eating there. It made me want to cry...I put the cake back.   "...Now we were both in motion again, moving ahead. So what if there were questions left unanswered. Life went on. We know that better than anyone."
