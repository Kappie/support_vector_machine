I cannot view the picture. Your link leads me to a page that says "Forbidden." It says I need a "local referer." I have no idea what that is.      I heard that Final Fantasy had some really bad scriptwriting in terms of dialogue. But, like you, I'm really interested in the animation. I'm gonna grab the bargain matinee tomorrow.      If you must know what has been keeping me busy, I joined a diary community at www.opendiary.com. If you are nice, maybe I'll give you my diarist name.
