And pick up the pieces if you need them.  This world is cold, but just know you're not alone.  No, you're not alone.  I know what you're thinkin'. Wooooaaaahhh I know how you're feelin'. Wooooaaaahhh Believe me. Wooooaaaahhh You're not alone.  I've been there before. Just where you are and not quite so sure that I did the right thing.  Believe me. And this world is cold so I'll make sure you're not alone. No you're not alone.  I know what you're thinkin'. Wooooaaaahhh I know how you're feelin'. Wooooaaaahhh Believe me. Wooooaaaahhh You're not alone.  Why don't you stay with me tonight.  Because I know everything is not alright. Why don't you stay with me tonight.  Because I know everything is not alright, and that's not alright.  I know what you're thinkin'. Wooooaaaahhh I know how you're feelin'. Wooooaaaahhh Believe me. Wooooaaaahhh You're not alone. Wooooaaaahhh  love for you always and forever, changedfish
