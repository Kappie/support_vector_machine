I mean, the English exam sucked; I'm still working away for History and mum officially consented to letting me get my ear done (upper right) -when I say consented she didn't say no or throw anything at me! Rob's also taking me to the My Ruin gig. I'm pretty sure its because I asked to hang at her house this saturday due to the fact we hardly see each other anymore (school work prevents us). So I take it she probably forgot all about  or  I could be wrong- this might be a wee treat!!   Hmmmm, whatever the case it should be interesting. I've been told the old gang will be there which means mayhem and mum knows it- so I'll be forced into a taxi to get home and then I'll be inspected for any signs of anything that I shouldn't (and of course wouldn't have). Grhh! Nevermind- its a night out!  Well, its 20 past 4 and I've to pick up the lil monster soon. So I had better ne off. I'll be back online last tonight but I really feel like sleep- either that I'll be at the club with Tracy, convincing her to come with me to get my ear done.  Maxay x
