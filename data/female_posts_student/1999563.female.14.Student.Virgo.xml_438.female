And I was like "Its a message boards..and I bet you that if you were to read every post ever on the board you wouldn't find any questionable content" and she got even more mad. But, Matt...he is ALWAYSSSS on the xbox message boards and in random chat rooms talking to these physco people and my mom doesn't even care..then this one time and I don't even want to  say what I didn't but my brother did the EXACT SAME THING at the same time and he didn't get caught but I didn't and I had to live in solitary confinment for two weeks. Then this one time I had 2 popsicles in one day my my brother told on me and I got in trouble then the next day he eats 3 popsicles and doesn't get in trouble. I don't think I can survive living with him. HE DRIVES ME CRAZY.  It seems like everyone is always studying everything I do and when I mess up, if even a little, everyone jumps on that oppurtunity to push me down into the ground and slowly combine my bien with the dirt.
