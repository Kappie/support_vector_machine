I have a feeling i have the karin curse. which would be wierd...bless me father, for i don't want to be karin!!  dance has been going strong. all mea i was at dance. but i did hang out with my mom on saturday and recreated my hobbit being in green and gold. it felt good! what else...ummm v-ball  is now over. our last game was a bomb. WHY DID FULKERS TAKE ANN AWAY THE LAST GAME! *pout* stupid stupid. anyways, varsity has been having the time of their lives because of all the conditions fulkers decides to do AFTER pre-season. where's the logic in that. ridiculous.   what else....i'm missing a lot of stuff but i don't know. as most know, i miss jason. kind of wierd and the dream i had was odd. sad very sad. it's strange and ironic at the same time. whatever.   i've decided to go on a mini diet. it's not a real diet just to eat healthier and not go to fast food all of the time unless i have to. that means no fun hardees or shanty trips. oh well i think i'll survive. it's not like i have time for it. well i have in an hour so i better eat and then get out of here.
