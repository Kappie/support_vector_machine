So I looked it up online and it seems as though all pools closed yesterday. Now that ain't right. There is still a month left of summer and I wanna swim. Just because everyone else has to start school doesn't mean they gotta close the pools. Sheesh.      Moving on, today I woke up around 9:30. Yes, it was an early start to my day. I woke up to my mom saying that she found a gift for me in the mail-box. I guess before William had gone to work he left me some Jelly Belly's in the mail-box. They were yummy. But anyway, my brother had to be at work around 11 so I waited around and went with him and my mom when they went up to work. After my mom and I had dropped him off, we decided we wanted some double-cheese burgers. So we went up to the McDonalds in Broad Ripple since we were up that way. I love McDonalds only because they had a dollar menu. Thankfully Taco Bell kinda has the same thing, but yet they don't have chicken quesadillas on there. Bummer. After we ate we drove back down by home and went to Target. Mom got some pillows and my brother a birthday card. Then we came back home. While at home, that is when I discovered the whole pool issue.  I sat around and watched the Olympics volleyball. Yay! The USA beat the Germans! While watching that game, a Chilson came over. Yeah, Jason brought my mom some Starbucks...is he trying to be a suck up or just being nice? Hmm, I wonder. After he left, my dad decided he wanted to go to Dick's. So we drove out to Avon and he looked around. We finally were home around 5:30. Then I watched more television. Now I have decided to clean out my closet and drawers. I didn't realize how much clothes I needed to throw away. So yeah, I thought I would take a break and fill ya in on my day. Exciting huh?      Ok, nothing more to say today. O wait, I do want to complain about something else. I get so irritated when no one listens. I hate having to repeat myself or talk over others. I especially hate it when I say something and someone always has to question it or tries to think deeper into what I am saying which then leads to them getting way off the subject and leaving me even more confused. Sheesh Louise that was such a run-on sentences,O well..Now I feel somewhat better. By the way, I didn't get my DQ application today. Whoops, such a slacker. Well, until next time, I am outtie!
