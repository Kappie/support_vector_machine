So Friday, we had a scrimmage in Pingry and lets put it this way. We got metaphorically raped in the ass and beaten. It was crazy. Some chick elbowed me in the back and then I couldn't breathe and I died. I'm not quite sure of the score but it was something like 2(us)-7ish(them). Then we got back at like 8 and a few of us randomly went to the really lame-ass Spring Fling dance crap at the HS, and hour and a half late of course. I just stayed with Nick the whole time... man we were so out of place. Oh well, it was ok anyway... There was that part where this "special-ed"-ish kid started dancing with me and then he did a split and it was scary. After that, Amy and I went to Burger King then we went home and I passed out at like 11:30. Saturday, we were supposed to have another scrimmage but it got cancelled and I was woken up at 9:30 when someone called to inform me that I had practice at 10. So I rolled out of bed, threw on my practice clothes, and left to pick up Amy. I had no time to shower and I was quite filthy from the previous day. Oh well. I'm a skankified child. After practice, I came home and cleaned and such, then Nick and Amy came over and we made another cooter cookie. This one was quite grandma-like though... Anywho, then we watched some random movie, then played Twister for like .002 seconds, then Amy disappeared for a few minutes, so me and Nick played Twister by ourselves....ahem yeah. Then Amy came back and we sat on the couch and watched "I love the 80's" and such, then I was playing Pokemon on Gameboy and I named the one guy "Ur Mom" and the other one "Cooter" and it was funny because it would say stuff like "Ur Mom defeated Cooter!" then Amy took it and played while me and Nick watched TV.....and such.... and she named this one Pokemon "Penis". Then there was this one part where we were watching TV... and such... and Amy yells out "Go Penis!" I thought it was funny... but hey I guess you just had to be there at the time... haha. It was an awesome night :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
