Alex and James dropped by on Saturday night, which was rather awkward, and now I'm feeling even more judgemental than I was before of their whole relationship. Then Mom came by before her accordian class on Sunday, and we chatted about what a nut Alex is, and about Easter plans. My Aunt Jeannette is coming up from LA to visit, and I'd like to see her, so I may be driving to Stockton next weekend, or there may be a dinner thing at my Aunt Rebecca's house in the Bay Area. Now off to class.
