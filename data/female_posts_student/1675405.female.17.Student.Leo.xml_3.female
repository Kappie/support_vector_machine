I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.‚Äù      -Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 1929-1968  Although the concept of world peace is so strong, and the possibility of never having to fear for one's life is so completely forthcoming, I do not believe that "the bright daybreak of peace" is something that can honestly be anticipated. Perhaps it is a flaw in my remembrance of the Bible itself, but didn't God witness conflictions, even with one solid language and set of beliefs, and react by creating numerous dialects? And perhaps it is the realist within myself that acknowledges the fact that since then, there has never been any situation that has even hinted to a possibility of a worldwide state of peace.
