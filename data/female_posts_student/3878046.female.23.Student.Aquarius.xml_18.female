thank god I'm moving to canterbury on thursday, because my mum was really starting to piss me off.  She's getting on my case about stuff.  I haven't told her about my plan to go back out to knoxville, but, she's lettingmy sister go on holiday with a friend and is even lending her 100 quid to do it, so she can't complain if i pay for my self....i keep forgetting that i'm a grown woman now, so does she.  she still treats me like a kid sometimes, a lot of times.
