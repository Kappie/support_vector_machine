While the first attempt to produce something edible last night was successful but didn't taste very good, today's result was far closer to what I wanted it to be. Yesterday, Jessica came over to work on chemistry. We didn't exactly do as many chemistry problems as we had hoped to because we decided to cook some pasta. I called my mom to obtain instructions to make the sauce. Mind you, it would have turned out great if we'd used the right kind of Pomi. We used the type that has bits of whole tomato still in it as opposed to the utterly liquefied type. Nonetheless, the pasta was edible. Too bad that the sauce wasn't very rich.   Today I craved rice like crazy. I didn't want my grandmother's normal recipe although it is good; I wanted "rice in white" with lemon in it. So, I made it, and I'm satisfied with the results. I should have added one more lime to it for it to be perfect for me, but I think that, for a first time, I did well. My grandmother initially wanted to help me, but when she began criticizing my every move, I became highly irritated and kindly told her I could do it myself. I know that was still slightly mean, but it was  my  rice, you know?   I find that I have developed a habit for eating rice with chopsticks. It just doesn't seem logical to me to use anything but chopsticks to consume rice with anymore.    Anyhow, I am ready for college now.   1. I can do my own laundry. 2. I can cook rice, pasta, eggs, grits, French toast, and microwaveable foods. 3. I am a fond PS2er. 4. I can iron clothes effectively. 5. I can fix some electrical circuits.   I am capable of other things, too, but that seems like a pretty good essentials list to me. Don't you agree?   Well, on that note, I need to go clean up and, if I ever finish winnowing the general disaster in the northeasternmost direction of the house (my room and bathroom) into place, do homework.   Sajonara!   Oh, song! Almost forgot. Er, well, I'm listening to it now and I really like it, so   "It's My Life" by No Doubt    It's funny how I find myself In love with you If I could buy my reasoning I'd pay to lose One half won't do  I've asked myself How much do you Commit yourself?  It's my life Don't you forget It's my life It never ends (It never ends...)  Funny how I blind myself I never knew If I was sometimes played upon Afraid to lose  Oh, I'd tell myself What good do you do Convince myself  Oh, It's my life Don't you forget Oh, It's my life It never ends (It never ends...)  And I've asked myself How much do you Commit yourself?  It's my life Don't you forget Caught in the crowd It never ends (its my life)  It's my life Don't you forget Caught in the crowd It never ends (It never ends)  Oh, It's my life... (oh its my life) Don't you forget... (don't you forget) Caught in the crowd... (caught in the crowd) It never ends (it never ends...)
