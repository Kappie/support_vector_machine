Whether through spite or accident, the person  that keeps you waiting will probably never be ready. Expectations trail  off into the nebulous world of dreaming. You have better things to do  with your time. Move ahead on your own. Send back news of your progress.  The further you get from this point, the more obvious it will be that  you made the right decision. Never doubt that  the stars are looking out for you.  -this is what my horoscope told me this morning.  it is the reason that i didn't walk thru best buy today.  no matter how much i'd like to prance past him w/my hair done and tight jeans on, it just wouldn't be right.  while sum part of me may be wishing that he's make sum sort of grandeos effort to try to get me back, i know it won't happen.  it's over.  in time i'm sure it will sting less, but for now i'm gonna fake it.  i'm sure 300 miles will help this summer.  it's not like he'll call or anything. -on a more happy note, i'm graduating tomorrow.  sumday is finally here!  they will call my name and i will walk across the stage and suddenly things will be different.  my ged won't mean i'm a failure, it will be stage one in my success story.  i will have a bachelors degree.  it means that a piece of paper will mean i haven't been wastin my time.  i've known these things all along, but now i will have the proof.  i did it.  no cheating, no shortcuts.  i earned my ba!  i am a college graduate.   -yea! to cheyenne- there is no one else like u! -yea! to sylvia - ur kool ppls and it's bout time that chicks learn how to not be a man's toy! -yea! to jenn-ur weird, but that's why we keep u round.  but u gotta watch the flakiness!! -yea! to greg- holla to w.w. and fatness and ciggies!!!  i can't wait to c how u rock this world! -yea! to farhan - ur a good friend and will go far!!!  i'm so glad that our deathly habits made us talk!!
