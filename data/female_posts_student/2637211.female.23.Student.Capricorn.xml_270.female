We decided that it would be a good idea to change blog entries while we were semi-drunk.  I'm at Liz's house in Oakland right now.  It's the first time that I've been here in the almost two years that I've known Liz.  It's been a good time so far...I don't really know what to say since I feel awkward typing on someone else's blog...esp since Liz is so smart and correct that I really feel like I might be fu**ing this up.  Wow...Jerm is doing something funky to the bed which is shaking the desk.   Something just fell off the bed and it caused a large comotion...can I spell in this state?  Can I spell anyway?  Jerm just said something about the slice about Liz'z johnson...the johnson that I don't think that she has...Jerm has now promised that he will be cool and suave...there goes the desk again.  Liz now feels the need to download pictures...  Which brings me to my next point...why do people feel the need to take pictures all the time?  Can't we all just hold the memories in our heads?  Why do we need pictures to tell us that we are uglier than we are...  Hmmm...what is Liz putting in my blog?  I really don't have anything smart to say at this point.
