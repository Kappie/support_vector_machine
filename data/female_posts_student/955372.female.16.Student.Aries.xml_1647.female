I tried to like open a window to get it out, but it won't go near it and  I can't get the window back up so I'm afraid that some other ugly bugs are going to fly in. No one else is home to get it, i'm freaking out. I almost like knocked on my neighbors door to get him to get the bee but that would be pathetic and I don't think he's home. Help me!
