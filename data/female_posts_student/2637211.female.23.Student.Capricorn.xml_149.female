I just gotta take my final, then I can call everyone and share the good news. So happy! And he didn't have to take a pay cut, he's making the same as he was at Tut. I'm engaged to a senior engineer at ... hmm, I have no idea what the name of the company is. All I know is they make some kind of weather computer things and they're in Hayward, so Jerm won't have a horrible commute. He's very relieved that he didn't have to get a crappy job in San Jose. That's a sucky commute. Whoo-hoo! Jerm has a job! It's really nice not to be engaged to an unemployed engineer anymore. :)
