Dain and I have started talking again n' the guy's turned into a total ass. Last night be openly suggested sexual relationships with me, and eventhough he doesn't want a romantic relationship, he still wants me to be his first? I'm kinda wondering who the hell he thinks he is, I don't want to share my sex with someone who THINKS it could be something special. I want this dude to love me and want to be with me every second, isn't that how it should be? Dain's wack. Second. My baby's friend was expecting to meet him and my man downtown tonight, well that isn't happening. So they might come over here if I can find someone to make out with my boi's friend (hehe! YES!). I almost cried this morning thinking "he" just wanted to be fuck buddies, but then I realized I was being paranoid and I'm going to work with the flow of things. You know what though, I have a damn cavity. FUCK! Now I have to get my damn teeth drilled, but it's alright, no biggie! Anyways, I better get going, I wanna get online and socialize with a few people. I'll write lata sometime.
