In my testimony (which I've told many times), I always describe my old self as one who was motivated by a desire to please people.  Every time I would ask people "How are you?" or help someone out, my motivation would be to increase my popularity or to be seen as a "nice" girl.  Very little of my behavior was motivated by a desire to point people to God or to obey God's command to love others.  It was all about Christine and how I could make myself look good.  After I accepted Christ as my Savior, my motives changed.  Slowly, I began to take a genuine interest in people and did things for others so they could know that love comes from God.  Actually, I learned how to do this from my leaders and unnis at Berkland.  Just as God gradually taught me to love people genuinely, I have slowly been forgetting how to love others this way and trying to bring attention to myself again.  I need to remember that my motivating factor needs to be LOVE, just as Jesus had no other motive.   Lord, thank you for reminding me today that I need to make YOU my motivating factor for all that I do.  Forgive me for using pride as my motivating factor for talking to and being kind to people.  Please help me to remember that I am on this earth to bring glory to YOU and to tell YOUR story, not to bring attention to myself.       More of you, less of me.  Oh my Father, I want to be  A spotless vessel so all can see  More of you and less of me    Amen.    **Praises!**  1)Smoochie  Me: Praise God for great communication with B and increasing closeness with him. 2)B: Thankful that B did his QT two days in a row now.  More than that, he is eager to talk about what he has learned and asks me what I read today too. He's honest about his tendency to "keep record of wrongs" (1 Cor. 13:5). Praise God for his spritual growth! It's true that when we are both on top of our QT, our relationship is that much better...  **Prayer Requests**  1)Daddy:Eyelid surgery tomorrow--Pray for a quick recovery and that this would somehow bring M  D closer together. 2)Sue: Eliviation from TMJ pain and for an appointment with the ortho specialist soon. 3)B and Me: Continued diligence with our quiet time and ever-increasing love for God and eachother.
