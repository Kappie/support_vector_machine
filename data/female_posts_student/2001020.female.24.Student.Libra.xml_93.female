Yes, both Gore and Bush sucked in 2000, but look where we are thanks to Bush?  Whatever.  I can't shake this feeling that I made the wrong choice of law schools.  I should've gone to Seattle.  I know there's nothing I can do about it now, decision has been made.  But I guess I still think about what it would've been like, had I gone to Seattle instead.  Today was the most boring day EVER.  Ugh.  I don't know why I didn't do a damn thing, but I just didn't want to.  I work tomorrow.  First day at Lonestar.  Whoopee.  I really hate working.  I need the money, which makes it even more the worse.  *sigh*  I've been doing this a lot.  Sighing.  I wanna go out tonight, but no one's here to go out with.  Next weekend, I am going to a stupid family wedding.  Great.  The cousin getting married is my age.  What do you think I'm going to be listening to all weekend?  "When are *you* getting married, honey?"  "Why aren't *you* married?"  "Aren't you a little *old* to still be single?"  I am not ashamed of it, but honestly, I never thought I'd be one of the last ones to settle down.  I mean, even R is getting married before me...she could barely get boys to date her in the past!  This isn't something I'm just making up out of jealousy, either.  She will attest to its truth.  The first friend of mine from home to get married never even *kissed* another boy!  I mean, honestly?  Is there something wrong with me?  I think I'm just not the marrying type.  I travel too much, my ambitions are way too high, I am not a compromiser...I guess I've dug my own anti-wife grave.  Oh well.  If I had to do anything against my will right now, I'd rather shoot myself.  I'm not ready to be buying houses and talking about things in terms of "we" and joint checking accounts and shit.  UGH!  Gag me, no thanks!  Alright, I'm going to have IM conversations now.
