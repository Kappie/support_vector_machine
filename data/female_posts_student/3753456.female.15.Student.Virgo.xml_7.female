Snaps for Karenne! *** and sam saw me in my lovely attire with my splendidly painted skin and heavily made up face. lucky girl... AND, okay, funny story time! when mum and i were driving down the main street of umina on the way home from my comp in woy woy, i was looking out the window and i was still in all my stuff, and there was this guy who would have been about 17 or a8, maybe older, i didnt get a good look, and when he saw me, he yelled out in suprise "Arghh" because he got a shock, or possibly because he thought i looked FAB, but it was hell funny, and sam thought it was cute.     au revoir!
