So the only way I can go though is if I find a date. I know who I want to ask but I don't know if I'll talk to him or not today. And he would probally say no anyways so...yeah. So I probally won't be doing anything tonight. Ohh what another typical Friday night.   I'm sick of the normal. I want something more, something exciting, something worth talking about.  Can anyone believe that there's only 7 more days of school left? It's krazie stuff.  So I'll be around here. If I'm not online and you want to do something just give me a call. And if I'm online I'll probally have an away message up so leave a message if you heart me!  Listening to: [All We Ever Needed by The Early November]  Tonight is a story of love Two broken hearts set by one And all he wants is a sign Of how she's making her mind All we ever wanted was  CHORUS: Love and love and happy afternoons Watching TV from your room While you're laying in my arms And I know it's not fair to me To see this love walk right by me every day Will we ever meet the right way  Again, again  Tonight I will sit next to you To see if you act like we're through To make you laugh is all I want I'll hold you while tears fill our eyes  CHORUS [x2]  Again, again  Oh, how true.  And for everyone's viewing pleasure...another song! [Sunday Drive by The Early November]  And we wait above a road We're turning to go home And the silence from the side of the car Tells me everything and how we are  There's no more trying to make it so right There's no more trying tonight  CHORUS:  And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone And I wonder if I'm alone in your head  I know something is wrong,  I just don't know what to do  You say it's only me and that I'm so perfect for you I don't want to try no more I don't want to make this right I just want you to be true to me one time   CHORUS   Twelve days gone by since I have saw you last I'll give this one more try I'll give it all my best and I'll ask What could you be doing that is so much fun? Without me by your side Without me by your side    And I'll take a step back and I'll let you ahead And I will take a step away and see if you come back Because there's no more trying to make it so right There's no more trying, there's no more trying tonight     We'll never be the same   We will never be the same We will never be the same We will never be the same Until you're done
