A room full of friends, a mouth full of cake, Every present is for me and it feels pretty great. I'm the (wo)man of the hour, the V.I.P. I get the first slice of the p-i-e, But first blow out the candles and make a wish. Put a smile on, cuz it's my birthday, bitch!  Go me, it's my birthday Go me, it's my birthday  Anyhow... thanks to everyone who wished me a happy birthday... All of ya'll mean a lot to me, and I can't thank you enough for all the birthday wishes!  :-)
