My parents are very patient people, having to watch those things since 1996. It was weird seeing one and not being in it. I never knew they were so bad... haha.  Tonight... went to the ND vs. Sikeston game. It was fun. ND did fine until we went into overtime, then we lost by 16 points. It was fun seeing everyone though. Kaci's Mountain Dew is a slut hehe. My phobia of walking into places by myself turned out okay when I saw Sam and Destiny in the Commons, so I walked in with them, since I halfway know Sam.  Oh, I didn't tell you about my permit! Well, last Tuesday I was FINALLY ready to go take it. We were in the car, and then we realized that you have to have a birth certificate. Mom says she will get it the next day and I'll go to Charleston to take it. So I'm all pumped. The next day? SHE LOST IT! SHE COULDN'T FIND IT! So my dad called the state of Virginia and we got it in the mail today. So I better damn well pass that test on Tuesday! Otherwise I will be PISSED! Haha  I hope I see everyone during break. I have to go to the beach, and I don't want to. I told Jack to go for me. Give me your address and I'll send you a postcard! Haha.
