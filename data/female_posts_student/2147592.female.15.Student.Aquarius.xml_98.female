I've sang songs that have broke my heart, and I've had a bath with some rubber ducks. I must say, I haven't had so much fun in a long time! They have holes in their asses and I couls make water squirt out of them and it hit the ceiling! Very stimulating... I tidied a bit of my room, I should actually be doing Task 3 for college, but it won't take long to do, I get to look at the positive aspects of Sammy's health... I get to look at Sammy's health for the next two years! How fun...well I dunno what else to write, I hate being bored with no friends, I'm getting ready to sleep and it's 7! I'm a sad, sad little girl. Well I'll write about school tomorrow, please go Tabby! I need you!!! I mean... Take care hunnys PlOp xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
