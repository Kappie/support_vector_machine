But instead I read the newspaper with Michal (my roommate) and she helped me pronounce things and understand things.  It was also the first time that all 4 of us were in the flat at once : Michal, Ola, Barbara and me.  They are all so nice!   Anywyas.  so instead of sleeping, Michal told me that I must go to this hillel pool party cuz there is going to be dancing and music.  So I decided to go but not swim.  We had watermelon and pita and hummous and pickles and those gross bizzlies.  My firends hopped in the pool and eventually Cara suggested scrabble.  We began the game and Cara is super hardcore scrabble club girl so its was really challenging.  We attracted alot of attention during out game lots if israeli hillel kids came to talk to us.  I finally talked to Hagui our madrich who upon finding out I"m Canadian started gushing over our country and asking em how to get in. Haguy is our hike leader so I already really respect him.    While Cara and I were playing suddenly I see capoeira pants!!!! and this dude was talking to Haguy!!!  SO I got details about rodas .  Then the intructor actually walked buy so Rotem (capoeria pants man) called the guy over and I asked him when the classes begin and its soon!!! september 1st.  CAPOERIA!!!!!!!!!!! (I"m in such bad shape though!!).   Then... another Hillel guy asked me if I rapped, cuz he's putting on a show and he wanted a rapper.  SO I"m like, well  I do spoken word,  I can kind of rap.  SO then I htought.. dude! I"ll ask my friend Benjamin ( who makes beats on his computer)  if maybe we can come up with something.  SO for these reason I feel like I"m ion the clouds.  I'm so incredibly happy.  Who knows where to go from here.  Nothing might come out of it.. or possibly big things.  Next step : talk to BEnyamin!!!!!
