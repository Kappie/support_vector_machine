Yeh, so according to Orwell, black circles around your eyes means you masturbate.  Alone.  I hope that wasn't what you meant, Josh.  It would be weird.    I have to go to an Amy Grant/Vince Gill concert next Friday.  And, btw, Stephanie called last night and wanted to talk to me.  It wasn't too bad, actually.  She talked mostly about Alex and his organs.
