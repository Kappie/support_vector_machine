For example, when The Badger came to me in a snit because one student's baby's due date conflicted with our final exam, it was my job to talk to her and find out if her boyfriend/husband/whoever could proctor the exam for her while she was on bedrest, etc.  What I wasn't planning to find out was that she had been raped, too afraid and scared of AIDS to see a doctor, and that her monthly home pregnancy tests never indicated she was actually pregnant until she was six months along.  There was no one to proctor the test and there was no one to help her give birth to this stranger's baby.  Instead of a scheduling accommodation, I had a completely terrible, heartwrenching, and utterly human story to report back to The Badger.  At a certain point in the semester, usually when the weather is turning unmistakably arctic in the fall or when leaf is subsiding to leaf in the spring, and we're transitioning from our experimental jazz unit into the background of rock 'n roll, I stare at the 250 blank faces in the auditorium and start wondering about their lives instead of hating them for sleeping through yet another Ella Fitzgerald song.   I also panic, wondering if I've helped their grades or their grasp of a hundred years of music they've never heard before.  I agonize over every e-mail...every conversation, because I want to make sure they're all taken care of.  Even the frat guys.  Even though they don't know it, and they're all only five years younger than me at most, and they probably hate me because I'm just The Badger's flunkie, I think of them as my kids.  I've told them more than once that I'll do anything legal to help them pass the class: wake-up calls, rides to school, extra study sessions...anything.  I'm not bragging, I don't think, because I really care about all of them.  I really do.  I've been worried about one girl in particular.  Amber introduced herself to me the first day of class because she noticed I had a Nevamo t-shirt on.  She showed me her Eldo jacket and bubbled, "We're neighbors!"    We were, indeed.  Eldo's a quick twenty minutes away from my hometown.  We both decided it was refreshing to meet someone not from St. Louis or Kansas City, and we settled down in a comfortably restrained TA/student casual friendship.  I took notes for her if her kid was sick, and she wrote me reasonably chatty e-mails as a way of thanks.    As I stared at my kids from the front of the auditorium today, I noticed Amber's face was peculiarly red, like she'd dashed across campus or she had some bad allergies or something.  She came up to me after class, gaze trained intently on the stained carpet below our feet.  "Tyson's father and I aren't doing too well and we fought last night so I missed the review session.  Can I make it up?"  Of course she could, and after we made plans, she finally raised her eyes to mine as she  left the auditorium smiling.  I almost vomited when I noticed she grimaced every time she grinned and that the redness wasn't from being flushed. It was from being hit.  On the face.  I'm e-mailing her now to set up a time to meet and go over some music stuff, but my fingers are itching to tell her I'll help her.  I'll do anything.  But how weird is it to say "Dont' forget to read those articles on Chuck Berry and by the way, Stranger, if your husband's beating you like I think he is and you need a place to shelter yourself and your child I've never met, please feel free to use my air mattress at any time?"  Is it weird that I would even consider offering that?    The other thing is that Jay and I are poor.  Like REEEALLY po'.  We need mo' money.  It's ridiculous that I even have Internet at home because we're student charging Ramen noodles and gallons of milk at the campus convenience store.  If I offered my place to Amber, I couldnt' give her food or extra stuff like that.  How could I give her a place to stay if she doesn't have money to feed her baby or get herself anything to eat?  Ungh...it's too much to think about.  I can't decide whether to keep this e-mail within the confines of the class or extend something...anything to her to let her know that I'm aware of how hard it is to maintain a life and be a student at the same time.   It's a sad situation for Amber and Tyson (and maybe even the father, whoever he is).  But like I said, it's also a terribly human situation, and humanity is part of my job description.
