Dreams, driving down the road, right in the middle of a great movie, but never, EVER right when you want or need them.  Never when you’re near a computer, or paper.  Never when you want or need to just sit down and write.    Since I was a little girl, 5 years old or so, I have been having the same nightmare –3 or more times a week.  I have had this particular nightmare so many times that it doesn’t even frighten me anymore.  The dream begins on a particularly high, rocky overpass with high guardrails –a place where I grew up in California.  There is no traffic, the road is empty, no buildings in the distance as there would normally be, not a single soul but myself –I am completely alone.  All around me is pitch, the blackness of the sky is the loneliest thing I have ever felt and despair washes over me as I stand there looking over the guardrail.  The rocky hills all around the overpass are illuminated and below them where the river would normally be there is hot, bubbling lava.  The heat of it nearly makes me swoon and trying to escape its heat I climb to the highest point on the rocks.  When I get there the Lava is nearly as deep as the road where I stood by the guardrail and I am compelled to jump, jump from the rocks into the hot, bubbly liquid.  So I jump, let all caution go to the wind and when my body is emerged in the painful, hot lava I am not consumed.  The immense pain drives me to swim the best I can to the edge and pull myself over the guardrail and back onto the road.  Looking over, the lava has shrunk to the size of a small river and again I am compelled to climb the rocks and launch myself from them.  Again I climb from the hot liquid, and the dream starts again.  Never had I told this to a soul who has not looked at me strangely.  Never have I been able to find any sort of interpretation for the aspects of this dream in a book, or on the web.  Still I continue to have it, every few nights, and I fear I always will.  Personally I believe it come from a fear of heights, and a fear of that particular place from a very young age. Yet who could say and while it IS MY dream, it is fairly illusive to me –I am no expert on this matter, not by a long shot!  I was talking to a friend a few days ago who told me that he had been having the same series’ of nightmares since he was a little boy.  Maybe I am not so alone in this as I believed.  Yet I am also discouraged every time I wake from that dream and wonder if I will have it forever.    ~Kristyn
