She has realized that she is no longer a little girl who can cry to get her way but a young woman who has to try harder and get a more serious grip on reality.  I have become split in half.  One side just wants to be a little girl and stamp her feet while the other wants to become something better.  I argue with myself and hear voices in my head.  "Why is this reality?  Why? Why? This isnt what happens in fairy tales and books.  Nikki, stop talking to yourself like you're the main character of a tragedy/romance.  This is reality.  But, why?  I want to be someone but it seems so far away in the distance.  It's like trying to catch a glimpse of a setting sun with rooftops obscuring the view.  Who knows?  I want to kow who's being so cruel to me and i wonder, who is the one who is weaving my tale of life with a golden pen or silver tongue?"
