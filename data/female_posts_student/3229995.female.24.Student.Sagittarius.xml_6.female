This screwball comedy casts real-life couple Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn in a film that finds the latter returning to her roots in a role reminiscent of Private Benjamin (1980). This is Goldie Hawn's film, she sparkles in one scene after another and hence showing why she is amongst the most successful comedians in Hollywood history.  A straightforward comedy, with no original twists and turns, but good wholesome American comedy.
