It was coffee cake. YuM. Then I got ready because I had to go get some shoes since the ones I got from Norsdstrom's have a broken shoelace hole(stupid ass store and their fucked shoes).  Well, we went to the Napa Outlets. What..a...selection(sarcasm). I did find some in a discount shoe store. They were cute and called "Serena by Sam and Libby". Only problem, they resembled shoes my grandma would wear crossed with ballet slippers. I didn't get them.   We went home. I went online for awhile because I have nothing to do since I'm grounded till Wednesday. I talked to Narissa. I forgot how talking to a friend can be so enjoyable. I told her about what's going on with me. Then she said she was going to write a poem about me. She writes very descriptive, good poems-->  urlLink CHECK THEM OUT.    Anyway, my computer was lame and kicked me off. Then I tried to sign back on but the DSL "couldn't find a connection". By the time I got back on, everyone was off. Such a joy*  Needless to say I got off and went to see what people in my household were doing. My brother is not grounded(lucky bastard) and was going to play soccer. My mom was doing whatever but she told me if I took my laces out of my shoes they lace-hole problem was fixed and the shoes look cuter. HA and they do. They're suppose to be ballerina type things. They're pink sneaker type things with long laces to wrap around your ankle. Take the laces out and you've just got on a slip-in shoe. They kind of look like converse all-stars. Only they're not because I hate those shoes.   Yes..my life is so very interesting. Actually I usually neglect this blogger thing but I'm looking for some titillation.   Ian's going somewhere with His friend Matt tomorrow. Ian called me yesterday but hasn't called since. Oh well.   I'm going to Chef's this Friday because WEDNESDAY, I'm off  GROUndiNg .  Watch out !!
