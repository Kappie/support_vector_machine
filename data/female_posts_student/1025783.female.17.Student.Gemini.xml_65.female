The shadows swirled and danced His hand rose up to twirl at a black moustache His eyes flickered in the candlelight A hiss sounded from one of the covered cages A low growl sounded from another A woman began to sing softly From within a covered cage The hissing and growling ceased The man smiled, revealing a showstopping smile "Carnivalé "  He whispered, his accent deep and thick The candles flickered out The Carnivalé  had come to town.
