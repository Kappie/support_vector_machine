If I just sit and think for a very long time multiple things race through my head about the purpose of life but I arrive at no conclusions. I find this very frustrating. I am seventeen and only one of about 6 billion people in the world. I am on a pseudo crusade to discover something that I am good at. Maybe there isn't anything. But there at least has to be something I have a passion for. I love learning and experiencing new and different things. There is so much I want to do with my life and the clock is already ticking away. Right now, I'm as young as I will ever be, yet there is nothing I can do. I am stuck in this sheltered bubble. When am I supposed to able accomplish and see amazing things? I am scared I will not be able to. Society has limited me from learning and experiencing everything I would ever hope to. Soviety has set a path for me. I could always create a new path for myself but it would result in me being seen as a "failure" in the eyes of my peers and family which would be fine because my alternate path WOULD eventually lead to failure without anyone to privately sponsor my hopes and dreams. Because in today's world you can't get anywhere with money. So ultimately I would end up in a cardboard box or working at McDonald's. Okay, so back to society's pre-destined path: One more year of high school and then it's off to college. And then probably graduate school. And after that I will be submerged into the corporate world where I will struggle to market the one "talent" that my college of choice has helped me to find. If I am fortunate enough for my talent to be needed by corporate entities I imagine I shall settle down somewhere. Maybe raise a family but,hey there's really no point in that. They'll be at school, I'll be working. We'd only see eachother on the weekends, and we'd be too tired to communicate by nightfall. Will the children of the future really need ANOTHER corporate mom? I think not. I continue this daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly routine(the same one that has haunted me since kindergarten)so that I can produce enough money to live "comfortably". Then for 30 years I will continue this dreadful cycle so that I can retire and have only a small portion of my social security earnings find their way back to me. By the time I reach sixty years old I will have neither the energy nor the health to pursue all the imaginary endeavors that I fabricated when I was seventeen and still in good health. Am I pessimistic? Yes. Am I looking forward to the future? Of course!
