During summer camp, I took a hike meant to last an hour in 20 mins, got completley sun burned, drank more mountain dew than any numan should ever be allowed to consume, and mud wrestled. I'll talk more later about all the great fun I had, but for now I need to go to sleep, I'm running on 2 hours of sleep here...
