Blonde hair, blue eyes, tattoos, ear piercing, nice and built (he's a personal trainer) and also he's the sterotypical bad boy:)! I went to his place and chilled at his house for a few hours. We definitly had our fun. But then i headed home and picked up Sabz and got my mud flaps installed, thanks to Rob:). I didn't really talk to Richard cause he looked crazy stoned and he was up and about, its weird, he's just fun to look at, one thing about him is that he has gorgeous lips...very kissable:) So yeah....then me and sabz went shopping and we had fun buying stuff...later on in the day T (black guy who hit on me in summer school) called me and asked me to chill with him, so i agreed:) Today i got up and took a shower and headed over to T's house, and i realized that i got a blooody hickey from Sean!! i had to use my candy necklace to cover it up! But yeah....i had fun at T's....and i also found out his real name which is William:) how cute is that?! the only reason why he tells people to call him T is because he got that name when he lived in Jamacia:)   Then i left T's place and me and Sabz went shopping at Square one, where i saw Bilal, with his cousin, he's a cutie pie:) so adorable...then Sabz decided to blow $40 on a little wolf which she wanted, and then yeah...we won't get into the after parts of that whole deal cause i am sure that Sabz is typing away on her blog right now as i am typing myself:)  As for tomorrow, i have piano lessons but i'm going to go chill with Sean again before i go to piano:) so it should be fun, and its good cause his crazy roomate isn't there to go metnal on me so its all goood:)  For the past week i have been on cloud nine! Nothing bad seems to be happening *kocks on wood* so hopefully it'll just get better:) considering this is my alst week of freedom, then my mom is here everyday for the next two weeks....:yeppie: Anyways i must finish my mcdonalds which has gone all clod on me :( anyways TTYL! ta ta
