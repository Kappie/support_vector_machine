We got 4th place at Islands and I have never been in so much pain durin a race. The 600 killed. My wrist was throbbing, my legs were locking, I couldn't breathe, and at the end of my race my head joined my wrist and started to pound. I got taken off the 400 cause I was like... just cramping up all over. I couldn't walk straight or see straight. So.. kinda a rough day for me, and the whole team for that matter. I'll post the speech I gave before the meet that I tweaked from a speech from a Lou Holtz locker room speech. People said it was good so, I'll post it later.  So.... yeah.... on a lighter note, I get my braces off tomorrow! I get to miss school and everything cause by the time I get done it'll be like 4th period and thats half the day gone so, whatever. It's all good, I mean, how much can I miss? Right? Well thats about it. Peace x0x
