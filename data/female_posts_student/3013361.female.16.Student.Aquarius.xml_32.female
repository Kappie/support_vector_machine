I don't know. But, I just feel like I'm going to expode! I feel happy yet I feel worried. I want to go dive into a pool and when I resurface have all my wishes come true.  Kiss me, out of the bearded barley Nightly, beside the green, green grass Swing, swing, swing the spinning step You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress  Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies  Dance silver moon’s sparkling, so kiss me  Kiss me down by the broken tree house Swing me upon its hanging tire Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat We’ll take the trail marked on your father’s map  Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies  Dance silver moon’s sparkling, so kiss me  Kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies   Dance silver moon’s sparkling, so kiss me  So kiss me So kiss me So kiss me So kiss me
