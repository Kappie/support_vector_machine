I juz couldn't believe what i m going thru. it all started from tuesday which i didn't went to school becoz of some stupid diarrhea... again... it happend becoz i stupidly ate ice cream at 3am in the morning when i was doing the 4 extra compos i m suppose to give ms junaidah. (ok, so e bad luck started on monday. coz i forgot to bring my whole file to sch. ms junaidah had pms :X so she asked those who didn't bring or do the compo to do 4 more... n hand it up to her the next day) okok.. let me continue my pitiful plight... so at ard 5 plus i started to have terrible stomache n i paid my respect to my darling toliet so frequently tt i had no choice but to "camp" there. T_T *sobs* at ard 7 plus the pain had somehow subsided thus i went to see the doctor who gave me some medicine which looked as  harmless  as the ice cream i ate. how wrong i was!!! the "syrup" he gave me was very sweet. i almost lost my sense of taste as it masked all my taste buds... *yuck*   although it was extremely sweet, it was effective. or was it tt i had no input for the output? haha... anyway i felt much better n slpt all my way til ard 4 plus. haha. *contented* then wm called to ask me out to go out wif them to shop for dayima's new sch bag coz some pamala anderson tugged too hard at his bag. hehe. *cheeky smile* gd thing tt i was not "lured" out from my cosy room coz i heard the gang hanged out til 8 plus n after van van reached hm n took a bath, the electricity supply went off. *giggle* being such a nice fren, she called me to check me out, thinking tt calling me to crap was something constructive. many ppl called n smsed me to complain to me abt the blackout too. hehe. (talking to me is always constructive ok... ^_^V) haha. chatted wif van van until 11.30 then she had no choice but to put down the phone to pack her bag. haha. she confirme missed me one. :P (oops... can see ppl gathering tools to throw at me liaoz... =P)   after putting down the phone, i went to do my a maths tys which was due on wed. (yes today...) gd thing tt i had the gd companny of my clay aiken n my fren lw (smsed me thruout the nite also a nocturnal animal...). if not i think i would be bore to death doing a maths the whole nite/morning? haha... thanks a lot lw. hehe. ^_^   as i finally finished my wk at 5 plus, i went on to the computer to put all my compos into a diskette. (my printer didn't work) then little did i realise tt i actually missed out my functional writing. *faint* suddenly, the lightning flashed n everything went black. MY HOUSE WAS PITCH DARK!! with no electricity n i have not iron my sch u yet. *faint again* tsktsk... went to check out e curcuit box n tried to fix teh problem back... haha. glad tt i put mr pandian's teaching into gd use. haha. n the batteries i bought in kuantan also seemed important. my giant torch had prevented me from groping in darkness as where as using hp backlight...  i tot this would be the end of my disaster... how wrong i was.... it was the begining... knocked my head onto the taxi door when i came out from it... T_T *shake head* the first thing i got to noe which scared the s**t out of me when i reached classroom was tt my time table was not the same as my frenz... (or should i say i looked at the old time table instead) *Depressed* so i noe tt i don't have english n chem!!! n I HAVE PHYSICS!!!   Good news: i don't have to hand up my chem ws today. Bad news: i don't have anything which is assosciated to my physics lesson. Good news: i have printed the physics notes for xiu xiu. Bad news: her lesson is straight after mine. i went to almost all the classes to borrow for a textbk n finally xiao huan has one wrapped nicely in a beautiful wrapping paper. i was delighted. happily, i tool the textbk n went back to my class feeling lethargic though.(oh ya. on the way back i sprained my ankle. luckily it was not serious) soon after my geo lesson, it was pandian's lesson. i was ready for the physics class (even though i don't have physics notes coz i passed them to xx). non of us expected this. not even me. i took out "my" physics tbk n started flipping thru it for lesson. n WAT DID I FOUND OUT!!! it was a chem tbk!!! xh hand accidentally mistook physics for chem thus she gave me the wrong bk. *feeling weaker than ever* thus i automatically got up from my seat n stood at the back of the class for 2 whole periods. a poor pathetic gal without a nite of slp was standing there weakly n having some stupid stomach cramps... ls was the only thing on my mind... haha... gd thing tt mr pandian was in a good mood today n thus didn't leave me with any sour remarks. haha. :P  next was chinese lesson. mdm wong's voice sounded like a lullaby... so mesmerised by the tune tt i had to pinch myself to stay awake. *yawn* it was something which i hated. to be feeling sleepy n u noe the fact tt u can't slp. T_T   recess was alrite but was turned off by the fact tt the new store vendor (or the new store which was opend for a few days be4 it was closed due to food posioning cases) used her hands to take pizzas into bags (sometimes spaghetti which had came out from the plate) n collected money at the same time. (now i noe wat caused the food poisoning :P) but it definitely smells gd. haha. i was quite guilty by the fact tt i didn't help xx to buy something for her recess. i was really very tired n her class was way far away from mine. (n was quite sad at tt time coz she asked me for her physics ws instead of thanking me. but after a while i think it's my fault. should have told her tt my printer wasn't working well...*apologetic*) sori xiu... i shouldn't do such things n rejected u when u wanted my to help u buy some food. really sori....   after recess i had 3 period of maths... hey! i managed to pull thru but didn't really understand wat ms lau was teaching. later maybe go look thru again. haha :P after 2 periods, ms lau went for flashcard n thus got the chance to rest again! *yippie* ^_^ our assembly was cancelled thus i had actually 1 hr to slp!! i was so tired tt even my desk looked inviting. haha. soon was in my dreamland. i tot i was in cloud nine when something hit me hard on my head. stupid... -.-"' the guys who played soccer in the class had "accidentally" kicked the ball n it "conveniently" hit my head. *ouch...* nvm nvm... i still managed to fall aslp after tt incident. haha. this really showed how tired i was.   haha.. today was pretty suai. hope the rest of my day would be alrite. :D haha. through this, i really appreciated my boring n hectic life in sch. sometimes even though i grumble on being bored, little did i realise tt my life was gd. at least nothing bad had befall on me. at least i m safe n sound. at least i m luved by all my frenz. ^__^ haha.... i felt happy after going thru this. (though reluctant n we can't change the past... thus i learnt to accept it n appreciate it! ^_^) Thank GOd for giving me this chance to appreciate my life. haha. n thanks to all my gfs in my class who were very caring today when the ball hit my head. they were all so nice. thanks ms, thanks qt, thanks dori, thanks yt, thanks von von, thanks van van, thanks mavis, thanks yihan, thanks cat, thanks cg, thanks daughter mad, thanks velvery, thanks 6677... thanks n thanks... ^_^ thanks to lw who taught me so many things... thanks to daddy david who gave me lots of advice... really duno how to thank liaoz. haha... i really treasure these frenships n hope we can always stay in touch! ^_____^   ~A friend is a gift, whose worth cannot be measured except by heart...~    ::The most cherished thing in life is friendship. The most precious thing between us is understanding... thanks friends. thanks for understanding me n fill my everyday wif laughter....God Bless^_^::   p/s: oh ya.. 1 more thing. low on cash now, parents not back yet. i killed my piggy yesterday...
