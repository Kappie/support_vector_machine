PLEASE do what you can--even if all you can do is forward it on to other people.  Hey all,   I know I usually bombard you all with worthless surveys, generally unentertaining spam, and invitations to parties but this is actually something really important to me, and I hope you'll take the time to read it and forward this on to at least 1 person that you know as it effects us all in one way or another.   As you may not know, the brilliant airlines in our nation have decided that in order to save money they're going to stop paying commissions to travel agents.  That basically means that unless something is done quickly and we bombard Washington with emails or whathaveyou that my mom and many other people like her are going to lose their jobs.  It is impossible for a travel agency to stay open when the majority of their business is plane tickets and selling plane tickets doesn't make them any money.   So here's what ya need to do.  In this email I've included links to the email addresses or directories for the president, vice president, senate, and house.  I've also included a modified version of the email that I sent to President Bush not even 5 minutes ago.  All you need to do is cut and paste my email to an email you send to them and you can go about your life.  It will only take 5 minutes.  And don't give me that crap about not having the time.  After all, you've had at least 1 minute to sit here and read this.  If you're getting this because you've traveled with a debate team or because my mom has booked you a flight somewhere or because you are my friend and eventually you want me to come visit you, please, please PLEASE send this to at least one of the people I've included on this list.  If ya do, I promise I might not never send you spam again.  Thanks for listening.  Love you all.   Dannie     To email President George W. Bush   president@whitehouse.gov   To email Vice President Richard Cheney   vice.president@whitehouse.gov   To locate contact information for your Senator   http://www.senate.gov/                   For Florida: http://graham.senate.gov/email.html  or http://billnelson.senate.gov/contact/index.cfm   To locate your Representative   http://www.house.gov/writerep/wyrfaqs.htm#listrep     Dear Mr. President,  I was both disheartened and concerned during the past week or so to hear of our airlines' decision to discontinue the practice of paying commissions to travel agents on airline tickets.  As the friend of an extraordinary travel agent who works many long days (including many late evenings and weekends) serving both businesses and families in our community, I firmly believe that there are repercussions to this decision that the airlines may not have considered carefully enough.    As I'm certain you know, travel agents are extremely important to the travel and tourism industry in our nation for a multitude of reasons.  An article in Travel Weekly published September 24, 2001 points out, in a year-long study of our nations' travelers, 81% of participants utilized a travel agency when planning any air trip, either business or leisure.  The study went on to point out that agency users take significantly more trips, travel more often by air, spend more money when they travel and are also more likely to hold passports.  It is difficult to imagine how travel agencies in our nation can continue to operate if they are spending so much time planning trips from which they will reap little or no benefit.  A majority of the business many travel agencies conduct involves plane tickets.  My friend, a travel agent for nearly a decade, told me recently, while trying not to cry in the middle of her office, that she was in the process of planning a flight for 45 people and another trip for 20 people from which she would yield not even 1 dollar in profit.  How can an agency afford to pay their office rental, their employees, or the fees they must pay in order to utilize travel network services when they are spending time fulfilling their customers needs for nothing?  It is virtually impossible for most travel agencies to plan travel without booking flights.  Mr. President, it seems to me that while you were doing your best to help the airlines cope with the fall out from the September 11th tragedy, they've taken your generosity and used it as an opportunity to punish the industry that has helped them in a way no one else can, by providing them with consistent customers.  The week after September 11th, my friend was on the phone every day, convincing customers that they should not cancel their flight arrangements for business trips, the holidays and the new year because she had faith in our Government.  While some customers were not willing to listen, many of them did because they trusted their travel agent who was not only a business partner but a loyal and honest friend.  I'm writing, Mr. President, as not only a vicarious member of the Travel Industry, but also as a customer of that industry, a government employee, and a citizen of what I am certain is the strongest and most industrious nation to have ever existed, to ask you to please not let these hard-working, patriotic Americans fall to the wayside the way the airlines have.  The airlines need these agents more than they realize. 5,334 out of every 6500 customers wouldn't travel without them.  Mr. President, I thank you for your availability to the people, for your determination and sleepless nights during this time of national tragedy and war, and for being someone the people of this nation can count on.  God bless you and your family, and God Bless America.  Sincerely and gratefully,  Danielle C. Malo, MHS, CRC,  Alachua County Sheriff's Office  Gainesville, FL
