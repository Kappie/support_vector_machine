I am making amends with old broken friendships, I am happy.   Seems to be random, being that its midterm and I am stressed out... but looking at it, i cant complain - at all. I have found a better person inside of me, one that I thought had died along time ago, Well ladies and gents, I AM BACK. I am on fire.   Just a quick few thoughts...   Organize, manage, network, motivate, and ensure that I deliver what I promise.  That is what college should be all about academically. Organize life. Manage life. Network professionally and personally. Deliver to myself and to others.     Five years after coming to VSU as a kid saying "who am I, what am I doing here", I am a young adult. I have acquired a precious circle of friends. I am about to graduate having done things I thought I could never do. I hold positions within the university that I thought I never could. I have found the strength of my own voice and I have found a special place for Valdosta in my heart. I have learned to seize the opportunities and defeat the perils I face, I must be more than an audience, more than the actor, I must be the author of my life and take control... In the fairy tale, it could end here.. In my life, it's merely the beginning of a new chapter.   I can be anything I want. Good luck and best wishes.    I am excited... bring on graduation.
