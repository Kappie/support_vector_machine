It's kind of sad really, Guess I'm the sort who'll linger, When the credits roll, I still can't leave a picture, The picture I hold... In my heart...  It makes me mad really, Wish I could blame a twister, Or a hurricane, Or my pesky sister, Wish I could blame away this feeling, In my heart...  There's a road that's left to travel, There are bridges left to burn, There's song I haven't written, Lessons left to learn... There are reasons left to fight, There's you to kiss goodnight, So hold on...Hold on tight...  It makes me mad really, Wish I could blame a twister, Or a hurricane, Or my pesky sister, Wish I could blame away this feeling, In my heart...  It's not bad really, It's just a tiny splinter, Like a stubborn leaf, In the dead of winter, A tiny splinter, In my heart...  Hey if anyone knows the real lyrics to this song, please send it to me... Would really appreciate that!
