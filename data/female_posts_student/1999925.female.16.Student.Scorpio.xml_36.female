Me and Rinn rushed home because we had to go shopping for Christmas still ^^: haha~ When I arrived home I met my guest who was staying for the break~ He is my sister and mines Pen pal ^_^ So anyways, I was introduced to him and then I rushed out to shop > When I came back from the mall I talked lots with Hide ( The guest at my house ^.^ ) and then around dinner Akira brought some Sushi from his store ^__^ It was the best ! Later that night .. heh heh heh ~ Well I won't say but I ended up dancing to Gekiai with Eden XD haha ~ Even Hide was dancing !!! " Eden! His head is shaking!!! hahaha~ " After my house we went to Eden's and played video games and so on ~   (Dec.20, 2003) Today I went to play pool with all my friends ^_^ It was much fun, but I lost cause me and Eden were facing each other and we were running out of time >. *Blushes* Hmm... I was kinda confused at one point about something.. but I now know why !! ^_^  Another good thing was I gave a card to my friend at school for Christmas and he said my drawings were good ^..^ Hehehehehehehe ~   (Dec.21, 2003) Today I went downtown with Jyan, Akira and Hide~ We went to meet one of our friends ^^ We went to the Future Shop and Akira had bought me another Christmas present ^o^v ( Which now is Chaos Legion ) Also, Hide had been talking more now ^^ Not so shy anymore ^__^ Same with me~    (Dec.22, 2003) This day was very fun!! Also cute ^^ At night me, Jyan, Hide, Rinn and Eden went to VanDusen Garden for the Christmas display~ ^_^ It was so beautiful! This was the first time I had tried eating Chestnuts. They were good ^^v It was very cold that night as well O.O One part of the gardens there was mistletoe and me and Hide walked under it~ We all had to explain what mistletoe was to him, but I never kissed him. Later that night I became sick >.  (Dec.24, 2003) Christmas Eve!!!! \^o^/ MO FO WA ! I went last minute shopping with Eden ^^; eh heh heh~ I thought I seen someone I know.. God.. I am stupid to think it is him~  Anyways, I stayed home that night and watched a movie my Dad had put on. IT WAS SO BORING! No wonder Hide feel asleep in the middle of it. I was feeling my eyes getting heavy as well XD  Hmm.. doesn’t even feel like Christmas! >  (Dec.25, 2003) CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Haha~ Tekken Bowl XD   (Dec.26,2003) Boxing Day~~~~~ Umm.. I didn't really do that much today, but when it was getting late Jyan decided to have her own little fun ( I guess ) haha ~ As for me, this was a very interesting and enjoyable night ^_^ Me and Hide talked for 3 1/2 hours ! It was great! We talked about everything~ I really hope I can experience this again someday ^.^ ( What am I talking about ??!! Of course I can XD 3 月 !!! )   (Dec.27,2003) Today Rinn, Sady, Hide, Adam and me went iceskating !!! It was very fun! Well that is cause I didn't do it for some time ^^' hehehe~ But I didn't fall. ^_^v Poor Hide~ He fell lots of times >.  (Dec.29,2003) Went to my eldest sisters house with Rinn and we spent the night. Man... Raz was reading this stupid jokes book XD haha~ Some jokes were really sad, but we all still laughed ^^   (Dec.30,2003) Today It snowed !!! Yeah ! I love the snow ^O^ *waves flags that read "S-N-O-W!"* Did I go out in it ? No way ! I don't want to freeze my ass off XD haha~ I mean, I love the snow... but today I didn't want to go in it ^^" Also, today I was put through hell when Jyan showed Hide some videos ( The old ones ... of me ) God.. I was so ashamed -o-'  Eden came over cause we were thinking of plans for New Years~ And I cryed >  (Dec.31,2003) New Years Eve ^^ Hehe~ Tonight we went to Adam's house for the celebration. And it is still snowing out! What a day ! Great Day ♪~~~~ We started the night with talking, drinking and eating... I am still amazed that I danced to " Gekiai Merry Go Round " infront of everyone ^^: haha~ And the bad thing is that Jyan taped it !!! O_O I am scared for life ! *dies* haha ~  When the Big 12:00 came everyone ran outside and yelled "HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!♪♪" And Takao's famous " Dynasty Warriors!!!! " I love that pic XD It is still my fav pic! But, I am still not sure why Takao ripped his shirt off in the cold weather ^^' haha~ O well..  (Jan.1,2004) The 1st day of a new year ! I feel kind of sick today... in the stomach TOT I think it is from too much drink lastnight ~ Well I cooked today for me, Jyan and Hide ^^ I am glad everyone liked it~ And my saying about cooking.. maybe I broke it, maybe I didn't~ I played DDR today after a long time and Hide tryed ^^ He was pretty good for a first time player! This was another intresting night ^^ Talked about life~   (Jan.2,2003) Today Hide went to Victoria so in my "nothing-to-do-ness" I baked some muffins ! They turned out great! hehe~ (Not to brag and hopefully not to curse myself~)   (Jan.3,2003) Went to Downtown with Eden. It was soooooooo cold! We went by English Bay and froze our buns off XD haha ~ After I went to Eden's for dinner~ It was good ^^   (Jan.4,2003) Today Hide came back from Victoria and we went to the mall and got print club cards !!! It is really cute ! Maybe some people seen it on my MSN ^^  While at the mall we also went to the Starbucks there ~ Nice talking! The scary thing was a song came on that I recongnize very well... It was sent to me so long ago .. so I thought maybe since of the time now it was a sign .. ^^ It ws kind of like a thing I wanted to do .. well ..never mind. It is just my stupid thinking ^-^ hehe~   (Jan.5,2004) Back to school for me .. sucks ! But I don't have to go to school tomorrow cause I am going to take Hide to the airport... hmm.. I don't want tomorrow to come. Even Hide told me the same thing. There is a snowfall warning. Starts at 5 am and goes the whole day... We both want this warning to come true. We tryed our best to stay awake and have a really good night, but well... the tiredness of previous nights must have cought up to us.. Shit! Still it was an ok night ^^ Nice a relaxing I guess..   (Jan.6,2003) I didn't sleep untill 4:30 am and I kept looking outside for the snow to come.. it didn't come untill 8 am !!! I was so angry !!!! >___  When we were finally there and I had to say my good-bye I was a really upset, but I didn't cry~ When I got home I stayed in my room for a long time and just listened to some quite music and stared out my window watching the snow fall slowy in the street....
