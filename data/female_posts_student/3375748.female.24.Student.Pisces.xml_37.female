One of them controls most of power, one of them works very hard and another one of them is kind boss. However, when three of them together, there is a war!!! Personally, I like the kind boss one. She is a very kind woman. She doesn't talk a lot, maybe because her English is not so good. Besides those three owners, there are 6 women work there. One girl just came from Korea 2 months ago, one stays in America 8 years, one who is the best nail person in our salon and gonna get married next month, one is K_andy's mother, one is very very very funny and nice person and last one is me. I am basically is a outsider of those women because I am not Korean and can't understand what they are talking about, which is fine with me. Because of that, I knew there is something going on in the salon, but don't know what is it. However, I can guess. I think there is something about money, some of them start to notice that they are not paid fair. Well, I just guess, I don't really know. But, I know they are not really friendly with each other as other people thought. When I work there, I feel like back to High school, you know how those high school girls fight with each other, right? Yeah, just like that. Luckily, I am not Korean, and don't have to get into those things. I am really bad at deal with women. And luckily, they all like me a lot. I think I am good at make older people like me as a kid or something.   简单美容院真是不简单哦！！！工作了差不多一个月，发现原来简单很复杂。首先哦，简单是由三个女老板合资开的。三个人各有各的性格，第一个女老板有着最大的权利，我不知道是不是因为她投资的最多什么的；第二个女老板最勤劳的一个，每天从早到晚做个不停；第三个女老板是最善良的，对人非常之好，可能是因为英语不好而不常说话。可这三个女老板在一起的时候就没有什么特别太平的事情发生了。除了三个女老板之外，还有六个工作人员，第一个是刚从韩国来还没有两个月的和我同龄女生，主管做脸和美甲；第二个是来了八年30岁的胖胖姐姐；第三个是35岁下个月要结婚的未婚妈妈，也是店里的美甲高手；第四个是韩国好朋友k_andy的妈妈；第五个是超级有趣对人超好的甜心阿姨；第六个是超级没有资历和经验的我。幸好我不是韩国人，所以不知道她们之间那些勾心斗角的事情。虽然我听不懂她们平时都再说些什么，但通过我常在日本人中打拼的经验，她们说话的内容我可以猜到50%。所以我知道她们至少是因为工作分工合不合理的事情有过结，因为大家都是靠小费吃饭的人，所以客人的多少就决定了小费的多少，有些人的客人多余其他人的，其他人就有意见。幸好哦，我不是韩国人，不用进入那些像高中小女生的圈子里，只要埋头苦干就好，就好。
