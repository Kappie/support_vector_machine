Needless to say I got a lil ferschnukered, but its all good in the hood.  We headed back to my house for some TV and a walk around the block cause it was a really nice night and then I hit the proverbial hay shortly thereafter.   Saturday:  Slept in a little and woke up to find my mommy was hella pissed at me about cosigning for a car for my witch of a former best friend.  Understandable, but needless to say she's still angry and I  hate hate hate hate  it when my mommy is angry with me.  Met up with the Doogie at the Palisades Center at  urlLink The Macaroni Grill  for lunch and then headed up to Joisey to collect  urlLink the Sheeps  at which point we headed out to Shaolin to hang with the lovely and othewise rawkin'  urlLink Miss Anna .  There was some drinking ("I have crippled kids, why dont you just field goal my cat while you're at it?!?!"), some Degrassi, some swimming, a proposed trip on the ferry and some scary, bad news about some friends (I hope you guys are doing better).  I also learned how to break your arm in six places so don't F with me! :p   Sunday:  I went up to Rockland for Doogie's Fire Company picnic.  I met his family and many of his friends.  Needless to say it was a little nerve-wracking, but it ended up being a lot of fun.  (Get out of the way, DUMMY!) Seeing him in the context of those guys makes me realize how he could possibly have so many nutty stories, hehehe.   Monday:   I slept all goddamned day waiting for my family's rained-out cookout to commence, but it didn't end up happening until later that night which gave me just enough time to get aggrivated by someone  really  annoying.  Here is a thought: when someone doesn't answer your 15 cellphone calls or 5 messages from that day, you probably shoudln't call their house, 'cause chances are they REALLY don't want to talk to you.  Rar.  Anyhow, Doogie was  so  sweet and drove all the way up here to get some coffee and listen to me vent a little and see how insane the phonecalls from said certain someone were.  Honestly though, God bless that kid, 'cause he saw me run the entire gammut of emotions in a 36 hour period and he's STILL talking to me and acutally intrested in dating, talk about trial by fire.  He's the best, seriously, and its nice to be able to finally brag about him out in the open.  (c:
