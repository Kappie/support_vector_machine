If my day today was a movie, it would be the lamest thing EVER.  I've been wanting to rant about this ever since that "incident". I mean, I seem so distant. I dunno. It seems like i've been going farther and farther away from my barkada. I feel like i'm not having fun anymore. Nothing's been the same since what happened. I am not going to brief again because just reliving the memory is hard and painful. Why has God given me this obstacle in life? Why am I going through all this pain. Why did it have to me my bestfriends, the one I trust my life with to be taken away from me? Why did it have to be the people who I love and trust so much to be the ones who are growing more distant to me? I don't know if I can still take this. There's always this deep feeling inside me... This sinking feeling. I just wish this will end. God please help me get through this.  Please...
