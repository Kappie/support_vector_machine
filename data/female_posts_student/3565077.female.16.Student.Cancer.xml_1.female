Just as I am, without one plea, But that Thy blood was shed for me, And that Thou bidst me come to Thee, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot, To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, though tossed about With many a conflict, many a doubt, Fightings and fears within, without, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind; Sight, riches, healing of the mind, Yea, all I need in Thee to find, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, Thou wilt receive, Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; Because Thy promise I believe, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, Thy love unknown Hath broken every barrier down; Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, of that free love, The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove, Here for a season, then above, O Lamb of God, I come, I come!   "healing of the mind" and the bit about being tossed about really struck me..it was like i realised god doesnt care how screwed up we are! yay! when i sat down after playing it i felt this energy running through me, i could feel god's spirit in me it was really amazing. also EVERYTHING in the 3 services i went to today seemed to speak to me..it was really cool, as i was praying last night but god didnt seem to be replying, but today hes doing everything at once!
