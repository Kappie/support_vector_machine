I'm always glad for an opportunity to corrupt the minds of the young by introducing them to the fine art of Mafia.  And now I'll have enough hot dogs, corn, and pasta salad a la Kimmie to eat for a month.    Today Bruce has been kind enough to offer to take me apartment hunting.  I wish I could stay where I am, this apartment rocks, but I can't afford it now that I've got a buttload of loans to start paying back.  I'm especially jealous of Bruce because he's got a huge house with a big fenced in yard that would be awesome for the doggies.  At this point there just going to have to be happy not to be dressed up in Old Navy flag t-shirts and sunglasses anymore.  The good news is that Bruce is making me dinner tonight (I could definitely get used to this) and then it's off to Orlando tomorrow morning for Daddy's birthday.
