I'm sitting here at school, and it is still falling, and a lot of it is falling, and it is all sticking to the ground.  It wasn't supposed to be this much snow, and I am not looking forward to trying to commute back into the city through it.  But hey, it could always be worse.  And it does look awfully beautiful, as I stare out the window at it falling from my safe and warm spot in the library...when I really should be studying.  And eventually it will stop....right?
