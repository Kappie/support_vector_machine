Today I saw a new psychiatrist...he kinda seemed assholish, but I hate to transfer AGAIN. It's annoying. At least I still have my therapist. She is the one that actually has to be nice since I talk to her about things. The psychiatrist just gives me meds. He did say, however, that if I kept being sparatic with taking them, I will continue to get "discontinuation" syndrome. It's like, you get headaches, muscle aches, dizziness, become disoriented, nervous, weak, and massively hormonal. UGH. Now that is a recipe for living HELL. Good thing it sucks otherwise the meds would be nixed.  Wow, senior pics coming up. Isn't that weird? I feel like I'm too little to be a senior. I just still feel like I'm 15 years old. It's scary. I don't want to grow up....  It's also SAD that I am posting on this everyday. UGH. I hate summer. I'm going now. hahaha. Wow, I actually think people care. WOW!
