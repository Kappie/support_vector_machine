I cleaned my room, took a shower, went to lunch with my mother, got this cd, went to my guitar lesson and then went out to dinner with my parentals.  it was really nice outside today, the sun was shining all day (after the snow storm last night/early morning) but I was supposed to give blood today, hopefully they won't push it to next friday, because i'm leaving for chicago next friday, gonna look at schools :D  yay. um, i think that's all I have to say for now.
