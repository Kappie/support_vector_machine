Let's back it up a bit.  My long-weekend at Sauble.  Well, it didn't really happen.  Which is not to say that Ally and I didn't still make the trip...  I felt a little bad, I had been nagging at Ally all day on Friday to make sure that she had enough laundry done and was all packed up and ready to go at 9am.  She thought I was being bitchy, but of course there's always method.  Anyone who knows me knows what terrible habits I have with being on time, but Ally is about 10x worse!  Tell her one time, be prepared to wait three hours.  See? Waaay worse than me.  But to my intense surprise, she was ready to go at about quarter to 10 that morning.  Good for you, Ally!  We got on the road with our breakfast (Timmy's for me, McDeath's for Ally.)  We were both a little, or a lot, concerned with the amount of fog and rain as we drove up Trafalgar and then Hwy 6, but kept on keeping on.  When we were just 20 mins outside of Sauble, I called to my Aunt  Uncle's house to get my cousin's cell phone number.  Except my cousin, Nick, was the one who answered the phone.  "Hey Nick, what are you doing?"  Trying to make it more than a little obvious how surprised I was that he was at home. "Nothing, what are you doing?"  He asked me. "Yeah, uh, I'm about 20 minutes outside of Sauble."  Silence.  "You remember, you invited us to come camping." "Yeah," that's all he said. "OK, so what's the deal?  Are you camping or not?" "Oh," he says, as if surprised by the question.  "Well, I've got some friends that came up from Toronto, so we can drive up there in a little while and check out what's going on, but I don't think we're gonna stay."  Fuck, kiddo.  Like you couldn't have called me on Saturday and told me not to make the drive???  For Pete's sake!  He met us at Sauble, we ended up going back to my Aunt's place, where she coerced us to stay under threat of death (or at least some physical harm.)  But the best part of the weekend was sandwiched inbetween all that.  Ally and I parked at the beach, and went out for a little stroll.  We spend almost an hour just walking up and down the beach.  Periodically the sun came out, and it actually got warm enough that we took off our jackets.  Heck, there were people swimming!  But that's just nuts--they were definitely out-of-towners.  It had rained the whole weekend, so the beach was full of these little lakes and streams where the water was draining back into the lake.  I guess the waves must have been going a little nuts while it was storming, because the shore was just covered with all sorts of tiny little shells, some the size of my pinky-fingernail, others the size of my thunbnail.  And it was just awesome hanging out on a beach with my sister, chatting, laughing, picking up shells.  If only the weather had been a little nicer... we might've stayed on our own, sans-cousins.  When I was at the end of my teen-age years, and Ally was still just at the beginning, we fought like crazy, over everything.  There was almost never a pleasant word shared between us, and most communication went through my parents.  That's no way to live.  It got to be so that weeks might pass (after one especially vicious fight, almost a MONTH passed) that we didn't speak, and avoided each other at all costs.  Now I see how foolish that was.  I don't entirely understand what happened to make us to animostic, but we wasted years that we could have been friends.  Years passed, no exaggeration, that Ally and I really knew nothing about each other.  Two summers ago, we had a fight (the especially brutal fight I already mentioned) and I'm not joking about how bad it was.  We had the fisticuffs out.  Pushing, shoving, punching, all bad stuff.  And screaming at each other (what about, I do not recall...) and we spent a month or more not even acknowledging the other person's existence.  I think of that incident now with the heaviest ache in my chest--what permanent damage did that cause?  After that incident, after the anger and the ego went away, I remember going to her.  It happened late one night.  She was hanging out in the basement.  "That was a bad fight.  I don't want to fight like that anymore.  Deal?"  And that was it.  Sure, we've had our little spats, obviously those won't go away completely as we are a couple of young-adult females living under the same roof.  But never anything as extreme as that summer afternoon.  Slowly, we've grown to be friends.  Very cautious friends at first, but increasingly relaxed.  Ally and I talk about so much now.  I can't say everything, cause there are some things that we just want to keep to ourselves, and some things that we just don't trust each other with yet (as horrible as it is to admit that.)  But for the most part, we are very good friends indeed.  I'm so glad that this has happened, and I know Mom is glad too.  How many times did she say to us "You two are the only sisters you've got.  So be friends, 'cause when your father and I are gone, the two of you will be the only family you'll have."  And sans-threat, it's true.  She is my family, the only family I've got, save for my parents, and we should be friends, dammit.  A couple of weeks ago, I was sharing with her my want to get a place in the Dot.  She said she was gonna live at home as long as she could, a wise idea and not totally unfamiliar (I will be 24 at the end of this year, and love having my meals prep'd for me.)  But we both got giddy when I talked about how cool it would be for her to come and stay with me if I got a place.  And it would be damn cool.  My sister is the greatest friend I've ever had, and I've only just started to get to know her.  She's a lot more like me than I've ever realized, and big-little sister dichotomy aside, I emulate her more than I admit, too.  But now, it's time to go and do something else.  Pretty soon, Ally will call, and I'll be playing chauffeur to her for the next few hours.  Little brat!
