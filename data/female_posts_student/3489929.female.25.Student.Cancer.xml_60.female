Doesn't mean I'll be getting anything else pierced, either.      I finally found a hardcover first edition of Iris Johansen's  The Ugly Duckling . I have all of her thrillers in hardback now- first editions all- and I feel complete. Self-satisfaction and utter contentment for $5.50 plus shipping  handling? Ebay freaking rocks.      "Becky" moment of the day- Lisa and I were driving down I-459 headed for the library (to buy cheap used books) and I noticed the van in front of us had one of those "Choose life" license plates. So I asked Lisa, "I wonder if they make one for pro-choice people. Would it say, 'Choose death?'"      Lisa kinda glanced at me, and then she did "the voice." The one that lets me know I've yet again added something to the "Brandie's not-so-smart alter ego Becky's Pantheon of Stupid Questions and/or Phrases." And she says, "Would you like me to quote that?"      So I decided to beat her to the punch.      Becky doesn't like "the voice."      Anyway.      Another week at work, and then only one to go. Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait!!! Very happy. I think I might even be nice to folks who call in.      Except for the Oscar-deserving customer who called me on Friday and said her excuse for not opening her account by her deadline was that she had been shot in a robbery along with seven other people and that her best friend, who had been with her, was killed. She called me crying and wailing and asking for more time because she had just gotten home from the hospital, and I said no problem. Posh listened to the call, and like me was a bit cynical. So when I got home, I Googled robbery/homicide in the woman's city for the day she said it happened... and nada. I seriously think she was full of crap. But, it's not my place to say. Maybe it really did happen.      Mmmm hmmm.    BTW:   urlLink  Photobucket    rocks. :)
