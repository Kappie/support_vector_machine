(well, this is my blogger so i guess i's MY normal thing, huh?) but wait, the box is almost empty! do you or do you not: pour the rest of the box in the bowl when it's more than you want to eat, but less than you can eat tomorrow. do you?   is it too wrong to combine the end of that box with a fresh box?   what's wrong with us?  i'll pass that one along to jerry seinfeld, he can make a tv show out of it.
