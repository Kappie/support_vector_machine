I recon a day should be at least 5 hours longer! *ahh more time asleep :)* Actually... probably more time drinking! *i mean non-alcoholic* I just like drinking more than eating... yup totally bizarre. Apart from tea's, what satisfaction can you get from drinking tea? Well I guess that's a really dumb idea... geez instead of using it to cure a disease or save a life I would be drinking cranberry juice *sigh* Actually... Lynne would probably add an extra hours onto the Bill and Laura would probably have five hours for break time! So I guess it's not that weird. *phew, got out of that one* Anyway I gotta go shopping in Bristol! Bibi.
