Anyway, I'll post longer later, tell ya'll about what you've missed in my life, because I know you're all  dying  to know...but here's a little thing I got in an email - it'll either make you feel really old, or really young, depending on how you look at it, but it's pretty cool - check it out...just click on this link and enter your birthdate in the pop-up box that shows up. Here's the link: http://www.frontiernet.net/~cdm/age1.html
