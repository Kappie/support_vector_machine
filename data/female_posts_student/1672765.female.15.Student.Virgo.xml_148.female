I can remember ever going to a "R" rated films without an adult before...I could be wrong though...do you think they'd check or something?   I want to go see Troy...There's no harm in trying though, right? Except...waste of gas...and gas prices are like $$$$$$ sky rocketing $$$$$.   Though I could go with Sarah and if not we could take our money and bowl a game or two or something. That'd be fun. Maybe I could get in touch with Shelby or someone and they could meet up with us and go bowling too. I want to go bowling.
