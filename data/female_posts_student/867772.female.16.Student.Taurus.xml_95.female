Dead Battery  is the 10-minute play I wrote for the Young Voices program- part of the Huntington Theatre Company's education department. There was a staged reading of it and a handful of other students' plays or play segments, read by B.U. acting students. It was pretty damn cool.)   What did you like most about this particular moment of the script?   -"Captures strong emotions" -"The line: 'It wasn't anybody's fault'" -"When the female character explains to the male character that he was actually responsible for the dead battery" -"How the story unfolded gradually through the aid of dialogue...we didn't know what had happened initially and I like the suspense this created." -"Good to deal with friendship in the context of tragedy" -"The setting" -"The scene was something I could easily visualize" -"A great turning point and opportunity for character and plot development was created when he tried not to remember the battery swap" -"The guilt" -"The intensity of the situation" -"The portrayal of a person shut down by grief" -"The build up to 'Chapters 3 and 4' (or whatever the homework assignment was) so that those simple words could carry such weight" -"The flowing of the scene" -"The argument about the parents' deaths" -"How the story unfolded" -"The closing scene" -"The true feelings that are shown" -"How 'Dead Battery' had such a deep meaning" -"I like how the characters work off each other. My favorite part was: 'No, I lost my best friend.'" -"The raw emotion" -"Liked the use of the photo to symbolize something more" -"The dialogue and the resolution"   How would you describe the characters?   -"Despite the strong conflict between them, they need each other" -"Real, sad, meaningful" -"sad-frustrated-angry-depressed-withdrawn" -"Yearning for comfort and love" -"Real" -"Typical teenagers, changed forever by a tragedy" -"Just like you and me" -"Young and tender with room to grow...I would love to see where this could go" -"Angry and guilty with repressed issues" -"Believable, sounded realistic" -"Honest and real" -"Depressing" -"Well-gauged and realistic" -"Hurt and isolated" -"Sensitive and responsive" -"Honest" -"Pained from a great loss" -"Thoughtful, sorrowful and lonely"   What words would you use to characterize the work?   -"Emotionally stimulating" -"Bittersweet" -"A tale of reconciliation" -"Powerful" -"Tragic- but the end was so sweet, I almost cried" -"Important" -"Very emotional" -"Real and very moving" -"Room for lots of soul searching" -"Displaced anger" -"Moving" -"Touching" -"Deep and charming" -"Poignant and real" -"Clever and thought-provoking" -"Sad and touching" -"Complex" -"Scars only beginning to heal" -"The characters made me care about them; has the feel of real adolescent interactions"
