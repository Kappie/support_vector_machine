Her name is Maria she likes the drink and the poor woman's brother died today....but as she was telling my friends and I this she continued to tell us other random facts of her family and life (in 6 weeks she has lost 4 brothers and a husband) and in her 70 years I am sure has seen a lot. Yes to most this should be tragic however for my friend (we'll call her Sarah) she found utter humor in this.  And as Maria continued to tell our wee group of college age girls the sorrows of her life Sarah's eyes well up with tears....are these tears of sorrow....oh wait no....tears of huge laughter.  I know as you read this you find no humor....however if you have ever met an old random irish person in a pub you understand the humor.  Thank God  I made it out alive.  Lets just hope I make it through the day tomorrow as I meet with the South Africa ambassador and other important peeps.  And as we go out for a night on the town (May I win the lottery to pay for it) I pray I meet no more characters like Maria....I've had enough for one weekend.
