I just wanted to let you guys know that if you want your name to be put on my webpage just to let me know either by hunting me down at school or writing it in a comment about this post but be sure to include your name! And if you are really nice then i might even write a post about you! Oh yeah, i wanted to also tell Maysie that i am glad that we are talking again! Also i wanted to tell Saleena that she is a kewl person*! Oh yah and i can't leave the girl, Kirstin, sitting on my bed out, you are an awesome person to hang out and talk with:>!! And as for all my friends i hope i have you guys in some of my classes next year~!!!~ bye
