I was walking home, thinking too much and I didn't really notice that I was kind of surrounded by people so I stomped. But what they hey, I don't care any way. I'ld rather not be popular and have actual friends instead of having that embarassing silence and the false smiles. Wouldn't you? Any ways, my brother hacked into my MSN account! (Luckily I cleared it out a few days ago!) Cleared it of...nothing... Ehe, so any ways what are we doing on Friday cause we got nooo school! Hehe, doesn't any ways sound so much bette than any way?!
