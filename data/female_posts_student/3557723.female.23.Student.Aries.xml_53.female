I've got a bit to do this weekend.  Going over lectures from Week One and Two. Two lab write ups to start on for PEC249 Biomolecular Design. Discussion questions to complete for PEC340 Instrumental Analysis. One reading and a Weekly Summary for TLC277 From University to the Workplace. Guess which one is my vegie unit? ^_~  Actually, the vegie unit scares me. Not the workload or anything, but the numbers of soon to be graduates that do not have a clue as to how to get a job, some don't even know what job they would be qualified for. o_O Sure I may not be a great example when it comes to answering "What do you think you'll be doing next year?" but I have a goal and I know how to apply for the job I want and I've done research into it.  Bronwyn and Nathan go up to Geraldton today for the weekend. I get the place to myself with Brillo and the hermit crabs. Sammie is also going to Geraldton. (Sammie and Brillo are puppy dogs by the way.) I'll be spending most of my time studying.
