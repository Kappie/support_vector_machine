School hasn't started yet, but today we're having a pseudo party (kind of like a pseudo tumor, which is what I had... sounds worse than it is) because the lab we usually sit around in is being used for registration today. Well, the bell just rang, better not be "late," as if you actually could be late to Newspaper. I can only think of like one teacher of mine that actually cares about tardies anymore.
