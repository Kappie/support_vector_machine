For some reason her and I had found our way in the jungles of Tibet on a photoshoot. We were both photographers, but I was following her the entire time, and I kept suggesting what looked like excellent shots and such, and all she would do is point out my mistakes. I also ended up following her around most of the time cause I didn't want to get friggen lost in a jungle. We came upon this hut at the bottom of a grassy slope, it was right on the river. It was so beautiful too... I don't think I could describe it. The plants I saw don't exist, and I couldn't capture the mysticalness with words even if I tried. She went into the hut (it was creepy) and I was like "hey"! So she came out with this guy she hired to carry all of her photography equipment! Isn't that lame? He was really bufff though, he was wearing one of those 80ies miami hawaiian shirts. So eventaully I was like "screw this". And I let her go off and I never saw her again.  Then I was on a beach, and my friend Nick from hawaii was there. Everyone around was collecting something for a giant device, I don't remember.   I wish life could be more like dreams. Everything in my dreams is vivid and wild and exotic, there's action scenes and and fricken awesome locales, its like a giant playground where I can be anyone I want whenever I want. As long as im sleeping that is.  I'm going to prom with Lauren. HEY GURL, WHAS UP!! Shoutout to Lauren! Tomorrow we're going to CAM's prom, then next saturday I'll be going to her prom at Prarie if she doesn't find out what a freak I really am... I think she's on to me though, she's been calling me a nerd over aim.   I gots to sleep, tomorrow is prom day!!! Gots to be fresh!!!
