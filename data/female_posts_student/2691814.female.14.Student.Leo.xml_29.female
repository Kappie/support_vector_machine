His mom sent him for some reason. I probably know why but im not going to say.    And something else kinda froze me up..me and ryan were walking to the bus and deidra comes and tells me that Matts boyfriend commited suicide!...i don't know why or how or what happend....i need to find out. Its hard to believe. I mean..he seemed pretty happy today. But the whole time on the bus ride home me and Francesca were talking about suicide.    Thalia called and we talked for a while...i told her about matts boyfriend but she doesn't know what to think...neither do I. But anyway i have about 20 poems to write lol...i've been putting it off forever. So somebody call me or something so i have an excuse to not write these stupid school poems lol. Byes
