There was a big flash and a pop sound and then sudden darkness. He turned another light on and said, "hey, at least the spider died." Smooth. Way to go, pa.  Dave hasn't been on all day. I'm kinda worried, since he's always on, minus Tuesdays, occasional Thursday afternoons, and Fridays. But today is Monday. So I'm worried. There's a million and one things that could have happened to him, and naturally all of the causes point to me, cause I'm like that. Stuff always seems to be my fault. My mum always told me that. What a self-esteem booster. Here's to you, mum.   Current Mood:  Too fluxuating to pick one emoticon.
