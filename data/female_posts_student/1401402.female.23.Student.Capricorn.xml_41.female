Because there are much more for me to see. As hard as it is, I dont think I can maintain to let him go. Its hard to let go and it hurts forcing myself to stay away. But this is what I really have to do Right? I dont want to be an intruder in anybody's life. Being a third person isnt fun to play with. There would be excitments but its only an entrance to heartbreak and disappointments.   I want to keep diving into him but I get nothing in return, I'm just fooling myself. I dreamt about him again for the past two nights. Does this mean anything? Is this a sign for me to contact him? I'm afaird that if I do, all I get in return is a breakdown. Cant he just make me smile once more? Must this be the end of us now? I hope not!!! Cant it just be the end of one chapter and going on to the next? I dont want to run away but I cant take it. I'm so frustrated, my decision was made but I'm forcing myself to be this way. Why should I push myself this way why?     Maybe I've choosen the wrong path. Is it too late to turn back or should I leave it the way it is? I can give friends great advices but cant do the same for myself. Dammit.
