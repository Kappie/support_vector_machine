Anyway onto newer and better things...i saw the esikmo joe video clip as well - it's so gooooooood...i'm seriously going crazy over the lead - i mean his mouth is just so tantilizing (if that is how u spell it). I didn't see the 1200 techniques one though :( Has anyone seen that funny song about a meatshake? Yes i did mean to write meatshake and not milkshake!  Mud, I'm thinking of mud!
