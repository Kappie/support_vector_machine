Kiss me  Out of the bearded barley Nightly, beside the green, green grass Swing, swing Swing the spinning step You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress  Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance Silver moon's sparkling So kiss me  Kiss me down by the broken tree house Swing em upon its hanging tire Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat We'll take the trail marked on your father's map   Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance Silver moon's sparkling So kiss me  So kiss me
