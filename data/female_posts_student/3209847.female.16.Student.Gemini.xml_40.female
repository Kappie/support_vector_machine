It had its ups and downs we will say =)  School:     -I turned in my Computer Science exam that I did saturday night, so i feel pretty accomplished in that class. Its a good feeling. I don't get that often. I always forget something, hehe.    -Study hall, i wrote my history paper, and it turned out alright. I read my email, it made me feel pretty damn crappy, but sarah helped me out. If you don't know what happened, read the previous blog entry. Pretty cowardish though. That's all i have to say    -English kind of cheered me up but not much. I should have been happier, but i stayed in my funk. We read The Importance of Being Earnest, which is really funny. So I enjoyed it =)     -Tutorial I sat in the library and tried to do my pre-cal homework for tonight, we're starting calculus! aah! hehe    -Pre-cal I finally figured out how to do the homework, haha    -Chemistry was good mainly because it distracted me from my mind. I kept myself busy. I finished the rest of chem homework during lunch    -During AP European (aka Study Hall) Did more homework, got ahead in some stuff, yippee.... haha    -Watched Sweeney Todd during acting, we have a test tomorrow! wish me good luck    -During Choir (aka Study Hall) Talked to Mr. Newberry the whole time  Okay, so my school day was pretty much emotional. But nothing really bad happened. Just shooken up. And i didn't get to have lunch so i was very fatigued and my knees were giving out.  Sarah picked me up from school and made me go walking with her, it made me feel MUCH better (thank you sarah). After that, I made us smoothies, another fun activity. then we just finished watching Love Actually. So she made my day really good. Overall my day was pretty good. I don't know how she did that! Thank you so much Sarah!  I'll post later if i feel, but that's all for now. I hope everyone had a good monday! 9 days of school left! yay..
