Today is one of those bad days, one of those days that totally suck - except for this morning before the final when the Chem teacher said "Hey Vanessa."  That was the only good thing about today.  I didn't think the chem final was that bad, but well they didn't give us enough time.  I would have liked more time to go back through my answers and go through the questions that confused me.  I felt rushed through half of the test.  I went online - big mistake - and wanted to see if the chem marks were posted and there was my final mark - 68%.  First of all, I KNOW that I DON'T deserve a 68% and secondly why does my effort I put in never pay off?????  WHY?  I feel like I try so hard.  I try, and I try, and I try.  Over and over again I put the effort in, more and more effort, so much effort that I don't think I could do anything more or try harder.  I wanted so bad to do good on the final, I wanted to do good more than alot of things that I have ever wanted in my life.  I TRIED SOOOOOOOOO HARD to get a good mark on it.  Look what happened.  68%.  I suppose it could have been worse, but still that isn't the point.  I can't say I didn't try my best though, because I did.   I TRIED MY VERY BEST .  But I feel bad.  I have a pile of kleenex now after crying so much.  I don't deserve 68%, I just don't.  And to make things worse I somehow only got a dumb 68% on the social final too.  My m.c. wasn't that bad, and I thought that my position paper was 80%-90% work that I did.  Then online is says my mark is 68%.  I am so confused, I just kept staring at the mark wondering how I could have done so bad.  I thought that I would get at least an 80%.  Of course for both Chem and Social I do feel like I deserve an 80% but do I have an 80%...NO.  I certainly worked hard enough to deserve an 80%.  So then why don't I have an 80%?  I feel stupid at the moment.  I mean I don't mind not being "naturally smart" like Ashley P. but it would be nice if my marks actually reflected a little bit of effort for once.  I just pray that I make honors.  I can't deal with not making it.  I am so scared of the math final, and that is going to be a real challenge for me but I have to make honors.  And well going back the whole chem thing, it confused me alot because I want SOOOOO BADLY to be some sort of Bio or Chem teacher when I am older.  But just how could I be???  If I can't do the stuff now, how will I be able to do it for university.  That is what I want sooooo much though.  I WANT IT MORE THAN ANYTHING.  It's my dream, to be a high school teacher is my dream.  And the more effort I put in, and the more I try just leaves me wondering "Maybe effort and trying isn't enough,"  I need to actually be good at this stuff, but in reality I'm just not.  I am not good at anything.  Hmmm Vanessa - name one thing your good at?!?...Funny isn't it, because NOTHING comes to my mind.  This means I have no talent I guess.  I feel like everyone has a place in this world, but where do I come in.  I want to be happy, I want everything to alright.  But I am not happy right now, and I don't feel alright.  I don't feel like everything will be alright either.  Finals are so easy for 99.9% of the population, and you know who falls into the remaining percent that don't find finals easy - ME.  Why does it comes so easily to lots of people, why is it that when other work hard it pays off for them, but not for me?  Just why??  What is wrong with me???  Why do I feel so different from so many people, but so similar to others??  I can't wait til' all this final stuff is over.  I can't deal with the stress anymore.  I'm glad I made plans with Megan on friday after the math final, because at least I have something to look forward to.  I don't even know what I feel anymore.  Of course upset cause of my chem mark, actually really upset, but I guess a little happy too for some reason.  There are so many things I am so confused about.  So many things I wonder about, so many questions, and no answers.
