The last few weeks were spent finalizing the marketing plan, pulling together revisions on the disaster plan my group reworked, trips to Pittsburgh and Penn State, writing grand proposals, and just a lot of stress.  But now the semester is over, I have my grades, and I have a month off (give or take a few days) until my final four weeks and two classes of grad school begin.  I am still in the process of applying for jobs.  I recently got my first rejection, but that's to be expected.  I keep searching for jobs and plugging them out, that's not going to stop until someone finally picks me.  We'll see.  I'm keeping positive, or trying to at least.  I am a naturally pessimistic person, but we're keeping the hope alive.  Other than that, not much is going on right now.  I'm looking forward to my final two classes - Bib of the Humanities and Database Searching.
