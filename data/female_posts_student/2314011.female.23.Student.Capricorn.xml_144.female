It's to the point where, now that I have a tiny slice of time in which to blog, I can't form anything coherent to blog about.  The week has been a big one, already, in just two days.  We're (the Media Board) interviewing for the top positions in Student Media this evening, which is exciting, for professional as well as catty, immature, juvenile reasons (to be explained at a later date, when the results of tonight's meeting are known).  Just wish I didn't have to miss the first class of the new session of yoga.  Oh well, at least there will be pizza and carbonated beverages available.    Suppose I should get on to typing up today's class notes, as any slipping behind in such vital duties would be quite detrimental at this stage in the game, what with the semester rapidly coming to a close, outlines needing completion and professors blasting through material faster than students can read it.    Wonder if the London segment of the current novel will ever have its day.  Probably in June.
