I watched "The West Wing" last night, just like I said I would, and though I did not give it my complete attention, I do have a couple of observations to make about it.  1.  Since when is  urlLink Dylan Baker  the Attorney General?  He is one of my favorite actors, so I'm pretty sure he hasn't been on the show before.  It was pretty cool to see him actually, since he is one of my favorite actors, and I didn't expect it.  Plus, his character was somewhat adverse to the administration, which the show is in sore need of since they got rid of Tim Matheson, who used to play the Vice President before they unceremoniously (and stupidly) got rid of his character.  I hope Dylan Baker returns soon, for the show could use more of that tension.  2.  Not only was Dylan Baker on the show, but his character was from....you guessed it, Mississippi.  If you'll allow me a personal rant on this point, I find it very difficult to believe that a Democratic president, especially one as liberal as the Bartlet is on the show, would appoint someone from Mississippi as his AG.  Most people from Mississippi, particularly those who are active in politics, are just not that liberal...not even the Democrats...and the AG is one of the more political positions in the Cabinet.  And Democrats from Mississippi tend to not be that influential in national politics, precisely because they tend to trend more conservative than the party as a whole at the national level.  I'm not saying it's impossible...just highly unlikely.  Still, kudos to my home state on getting a mention on "The West Wing."  3.  Other than this, I found the episode to be sort of weak.  There were nice moments, as there always are on holiday episodes, including one between the President and the First Lady, who have been having some marital difficulties as of late.  But overall, I couldn't really figure out what was going on here.  It was very erratic.  Perhaps this was supposed to be some statement and representation of what the holidays are like for people, and what it's like to be President, but there was just too much going on, most of which didn't really bear any sort of relation to anything else going on, or anything else that has ever happened on the show.    That said, it could have been worse.  And it was a lot better than most of the episodes this season.  And it will probably be enough to get me to tune in after the holidays are over.  I've been looking for a reason to give up on this show for awhile, and they showed me enough last night to make me stick with it for just a little bit longer.  Sorry for the hopeless rant about my television show.  But I don't know anyone else who watches it regularly, so I have to vent my frustrations about it somewhere.  After all, television is life.
