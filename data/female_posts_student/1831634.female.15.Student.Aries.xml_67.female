LIES!!  I so do not feel that way.  grr.  anyways.  I found a longlost gap dress in my closet today!  I wonder if it will work as the banquet dress.  probably not.  grr.  but I want to go dress shopping this weekend!  kailing, let us go!  hehehehehe.  the gap dress is so happy.  it was so cheap.  it was only 7.50.  hahahaha.  and the original price was 50 dollars.  hahaha.  that is so sad.  anyways.  I don't think it's formal.  so.  yeah.  I like it!  it was at the back of my closet for ages.  now...  I went flower picking with chuan and jackie and yini today.  I went crazy over yellow primroses.  I picked over 20 of them!  I just pulled them out of the ground.  and then jackie and chuan drowned them... so I had to keep pulling more.  and then we were like, "ooh, flower!  do we need it?  dunno!  let's just pick it and see!"  so we did.  we had to pull six of every flower cuz we were all on diff groups.  except jackie and chuan.  anyways.  so then we pulled flowers!  and then we went to jackie's house and pressed them like crazy.  and then jason had a group project going on, too!  and all of them laughed at us for having to do the flower project.  but we got like... 5 flowers today!  for everyone!   I was like, "wow, that was productive!"  I was a master digger.  =D  OH, chuan DROPPED HIS SPADE ON MY HEAD.  like, he was standing over me watching me dig a yellow primrose, and he just DROPPED HIS SPADE.  and the sharp pointy end hit me square on the head!  and I was like "ooooowwww~~~  chuaaaaaaan...!!!"  and he was like, "sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry!"  and then he rubbed my head.  and I was like, "don't touch my head.  HAHAHAHA.  cuz I pulled AND pressed ALL his flowers.  cuz he can't pull or press.  I'm serious.  he and jackie... dunno how they do it.  they're so totally on crack.  and then jackie and I read the balcony scene from RJ!!  I was romeo and she was juliet.  and now I'm gonna go try out for  a part cuz I can't stand having teresa rodriguiz stumbling all over the shakespearean language and reading all slow like that.  in her HIGH PREPPY voice, too.  grr.  okay, since kailing is pressuring me and since I dun wanna write five notes, I'm gonna publish it now.  =D
