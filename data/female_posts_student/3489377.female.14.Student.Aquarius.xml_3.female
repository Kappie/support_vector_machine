I got it back but I was upset..I missed my Babe and I couldn't even call him..I was there for a week. I thought the food was bad..It was expensive too..$6.39 for a burger and fries. I could buy three burgers with that..The Fantasia Pool was horrible. It was cloudy and looked like ten million kids pissed in it. Yeah, I have the right to complain. I was happy when I could stay up late and walk to the food court for free drinks. I was alone to think about stuff. I wore "color" clothes because it was so hot..Oh well
