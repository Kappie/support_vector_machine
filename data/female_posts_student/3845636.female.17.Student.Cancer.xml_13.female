I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder, Over sideways and under, on a magic carpet ride  A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming. A whole new world,A dazzling place I never knew But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear That now I'm in a whole new world with you.  Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling through an endless diamond sky  A whole new world, / Don't you dare close your eyes, A hundred thousand things to see. / Hold your breath it gets better. I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far, I can't go back to where I used to be /A whole new world, With new horizons to pursueI'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you  A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming. A whole new world,Every turn a surprise, With new horizons to pursue / every moment red-letter. I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spareanywhere, there's time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you  A whole new world / A whole new world That's where we'll be / That's where we'll beA thrilling chase A wondrous placeFor you and me.  hehe~ really love this song to bits... lovely lyrics... melodious tune... it puts you into the dream world of your own. A song that has ironically been replaying in my mind lately. haha... maybe it's time for me to think back about the precious moment I hold... and to see how I can take a step forwardinto a whole new chapter of my life.
