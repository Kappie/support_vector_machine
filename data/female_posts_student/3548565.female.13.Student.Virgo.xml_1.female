 So...there isn't much to tell for now. I'm just like any other ordinary teenager. I am *ahem* currenlty unattached, lolz. Don't have a strong wish to find an "attachment" lol...but who knows? ;) =P Hehe..   
Everything's fine so far..I hope it would continue to be. Since I'm having my holidays now, I've been doing pretty much nothing but sitting at home pondering over the boredom of my life.  $Om3OnE h3Lp M333333!!!! 
Lolz, OK, guess that's enough. I don't have much to say right now, but if there's anything else going on in this girl's life, I'll keep you updated. Ciao! *muakssssssss*
