So the latest news is that I am not working anymore at that CPA-Law firm.  And no, I was not fired.  I quit.  Because of good reasons too.  Usually when I think of people quitting, I see them as weak individuals.  But just as Syd tells Sark in season 2 of Alias, "Just so you know, I am fully strong."  lol.  Remember that one?  When Sloane was replaced by Geiger?  I am giving Danielle publicity  urlLink for her new xanga!   Go there!  Read it!  Love it!  BTW: Your visual backstage pass to my dance recital coming soon!
