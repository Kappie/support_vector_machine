MY WISHED HAVE BEEN GRANTED! wel...now what happened to the frog then? These are a few of my own theories:  1. The frog melted 2. The frog ran away 3. The frog died and ran away 4. Because i have special magic POWERS! kapow kapow...well my MAGIC SPELL turned the frog into a leaf 5. The frog became too skinny that it escaped and got accidently flushed down the toilet 6. The frog's friend did some kinda little spell that made the frog dissapear out of thin air 7. My mum killed it 8. My mum dropped it down the drain 9. My stupid sisters ate ..accidently 10. I was sleep walking and i killed it  well it doesnt matter! ITS GONE! KA-POOF! the frog is gone...ill just go do a little happy dance...lol..yay!  YA-HOO! HEH HEH! byes! ;)
