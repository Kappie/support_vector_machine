On a side note: RE called again. I honestly think he's one of the sweetest musicians I've ever met, even if I'm still skeptical regarding his claim that the flattery is not, in fact, a sales pitch. lol. I wish more people called me =D Even if I don't answer the phone. It makes me feel important.   So, anyways. Deliriously happy for no apparent reason, important and potentially life-altering realizations that I refuse to spill, and now I'm going to run off and leave y'all wondering what the hell I'm talking about :) Sound good? Great. Go to it.
