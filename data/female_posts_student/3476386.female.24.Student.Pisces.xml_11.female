Though the movie had its borderline tardo moments, it made me realize I just can't proclaim my love for Will Farrell enough. He is one class act, I tell ya. Timeless. If you ask me, who do you consider afunny guy? I say Will Farrell hands down. He's one of those people that I wish was my chum, my compa, my wingman. To be friends with Will Farrell...ahh tobe so lucky. Hell, I'd even marry him for the laughs. Wait a minute. No, I wouldn't. I was being hasty there. But Isure do wish he was my friend. That would be something.
