Hmm, homework and cleaning my room which is disgustingly dirty and messy. Thatway I get tomorrow to 'relax' as Goff says. If you didn't get that when I asked her what she up too in the summer holidays it was 'nothing much, just relaxing' then I ask what are you going to do on holiday? 'Relax'. Bless. I am going to Croydon next weekend with Angela hopefully. I have vouchers to spend and hopefully I can get a computer game I have wanted for ages. I prefer games like the Sims where youa ct as god. LOL. Like Rolocoaster tycoon etc... I prefer them than fighting games. I reckon there are way too many of those games out, I mean how many can you possibly make! They are all the same! Your character justs goes around shoots and blows up people. Yea... that is why I like manger type games. You can make the Sims do so many things! You can design your own rolocoasters and see if people like them etc.. Much more mind stimulating I reckon. What things have I got to look forward too? Freddie Prinze Jr. and Chris Klein! Yay. And at half term I'm going on up to Norfolk to see my Auntie. I already know one day we are going up to this posh country club like we did before for a dinner. I love country clubs. they are so countrylike and posh. I already said that but they are. Honest.  Where is Jo nowadays? I mean I know she is helping her friend at the panto but now its the weekend! Shes gotta blog at some point, hasn't she? Hey guys, don't forget,  09:00PM - BBC2 - TAKEN . Watch it, please. Pleeeeeeease. Although its episode 4 I am waiting for when my love is in it. :)
