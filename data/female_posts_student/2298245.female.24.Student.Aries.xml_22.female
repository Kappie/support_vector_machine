Perhaps that statement is a bit redundant, since the idea of a blog implies a location in cyberspace, but I think those of you reading this will forgive me for my redundancy, as well as for my neurotic tendencies, which should be all too clear to you by now.  I guess I should tell a little bit about myself for those people reading this who don't know me.  My name is Shannon.  I'm from Mississippi, but I live in New York now and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  I'm currently in law school, which I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you are really sure you want to be a lawyer, and even then I'd pause.  But my judgment may be clouded by the fact that I am deep in the throes of exam preparation and I know that it is only going to get worse before it gets better, so perhaps we'll have to revisit this topic when I graduate.  Since I'm in law school, I really don't have that much time for other interests, but when I do, I like to watch television, read, go to the movies, and follow current political events.  I've read blogs before, and thought they were pretty cool and, more importantly, that it would be something fun that I might actually be good at, so, coupling this with my deep feelings of the importance of myself and the things I have to say (read:  I'm self-absorbed and little arrogant), I figured I was the perfect candidate to do this sort of thing.  So here I am.  If you're bored already, then I wouldn't recommend coming back.  But if not, I promise all my posts won't be so, well, self-centered.  So enjoy your future adventures on the web, whether they bring you back here or not.
