Since i couldnt get in the water cuz of my foot I was in charge of the prize table wich half of the time i left it cuz it was too hot outside!!! Miree kiristi and I left like 2 times to get ice for the snow cone machine I think we all got frostbite! Oh and Miree kicked connie! I felt so bad for connie! (btw connie is miree's car!) we also did a pinata and my dad made hot dogs they were pretty good it was the first time i had hot dogs in a really long time.   Oh when we did the pinata I did my good deed for the day!! I was so proud of myself! We did it in the parking lot and the cement was hot. and i know how hot cement can hurt thanks to CTO lee making us do push ups on the cement but anywayz this little girl didnt have her shoes on so i let her have my flip-flops so that way she could go and get some candy! she was so cute!  after game day ended We went to champs to get some food. Normally i would say dinner but i dont think that what we ate was actually dinner! we did have some normal food but most of it was desserts we had 3 messy sunday things a cookie icream thingy a mile high cake and a chocolate cake and we had onion rings and 2 sampler platters!  oh funny story at champs there were 10 of us (i think) but we had two sets of onion rings at each end of the table, well vanessa's end finished all there onion rings (imagine that) and we only ate like 2 of ours, well when the waiter came to pick up the food he asked us if we were done with the onion rings and miree,chris, chelsea and i were like yea, but vanessa saw that we still had some and was like OH OH OH it was so funny I guess you had to have been there! but since miree is the only one who reads this i dont think it is a problem cuz she was there!!!  Tonight ausitn miree and i are going to st. anthony's for church so we can make fun of them!!!! I cant wait!
