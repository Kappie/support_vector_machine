YES!* So this morning I went to yearbook, we're just having like pre-meetings to discuss the theme, learn some stuff, randomness that we wont hafta re learn when the school year actually starts.  It wasnt too bad but there's not a lot of us on there! [[boo on brad and lee]] But itll be blast w/ maggie, jen, alyson, christine, and iris! *woot woot*  Then some of us headed out to NY pizza! Yummm! THat was a blast, telling great stories [must remember to ask jen and maggie for the pictures], giving directions, and eating good pizza [[FOLDED IN HALF!! okay?]] Then we came back to my house and we hung around, maggie, jen, and brad got the tour from me and christine, then we hung around on my bed or in my bathtub! haha or on the thrown!   Went to maggies and jens so taht they could change, brad went to get lee, then we headed over to the pool! There was this HUGE beach ball taht the guys kept jumping onto--it was hilarious! Loved christine's bathing suit too *smiley* So yeah that was really fun and made everyone hungry, so brad did his normal thing he does whenever he's near jen's house! LETS RAID THE KITCHEN! Went to jens, made mac n cheese, played pool w/ christine against lee, and then around 545 me, lee, and brad bounced.  Lee mooned this poor lady walking her dog! haha goofball! Gotta see the nice side view in the side mirror *haha* Dropped lee off, then brad brought me home, and TA DA! Home right for dinner time, it rocks! Which reminds me..i must find the right time stamp cuz this one is an hour behind, oh well eventually!
