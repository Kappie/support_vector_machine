She loves pink (like Trista) and so do I! :) For some reason, I can't stop recollecting the phrase "Pink Sorority Sluts". I ain't referring to my mom and I. It's just that when Nora and I hung out during Christmas last year, she mentioned about Ignatious actually labelling us as the "Sorority Sluts". Bwahaa. How can that happen? Haha! Honestly dude, we're such innocent little girls. * Clears throat * Aiight, toodles sweeties!   I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find The better part of me   I'm more than a bird I'm more than a plane More than some pretty face beside a train and It's not easy to be me   Wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie About a home I'll never see   It may sound absurd But don't be naive Even Heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed But won't you conceed Even Heroes have the right to dream but It's not easy to be me   Up, up and away Away from me It's all right You can all sleep sound tonight I'm not crazy or anything  I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive Men weren't meant to ride With clouds between their knees   I'm only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street Only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me    It's not easy to be me .
