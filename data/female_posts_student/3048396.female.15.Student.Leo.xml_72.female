Next time I open my mouth to say something I'll crack. Nevermind...just did. Maybe its this song. I like this song...I think its my new favorite but it makes me cry at times. I don't know. Maybe because...*shrug* Everythings really weird. The more I talk to some people bout some stuff the more they tell me its probably true. The way everything fits...Im thinkin its true too....Im not gonna say any names or anything cuz I know some people do read this but yeah. It really pisses me off...*sigh* I guess its just another opstical...But yeah. Todays the day my wish I made on that star came true one year ago. I thank God everynight for him. I love him sooo much...more than anyone knows...hes my world. Id be lost without him. And I'll never stop loving him...ever. I love you Ross Charles Murtle...with all of my heart. Theres nothing I love more. I cry now...because I love you sooo much. You are my life.   Now heres a song a country one...yeah yeah I know...you all hate country but I don't...this song always just reminds me of some stuff...cuz it says "they said I bet they'd never make it" and last year before we left synod someone said that these church long distance relationships don't last very long...well if you consider a year short...I guess that still applies...but I don't...anyhow here it is. Listen to it sometime. It makes me cry...like any other good song...  When I first saw you, I saw love. And the first time you touched me, I felt love. And after all this time, you're still the one I love.  Looks like we made it Look how far we've come my baby We mighta took the long way We knew we'd get there someday  They said, "I bet they'll never make it" But just look at us holing on We're still together still going strong   (You're still the one) You're still the one I run to The one that I belong to You're still the one I want for life (You're still the one) You're still the one that I love The only one I dream of You're still the one I kiss good night  Ain't nothin' better We beat the odds together I'm glad we didn't listen Look at what we would be missin'   They said, "I bet they'll never make it" But just look at us holing on We're still together still going strong   (You're still the one) You're still the one I run to The one that I belong to You're still the one I want for life (You're still the one) You're still the one that I love The only one I dream of You're still the one I kiss good night  (You're still the one) You're still the one I run to The one that I belong to You're still the one I want for life (You're still the one) You're still the one that I love The only one I dream of You're still the one I kiss good night  I'm so glad we made it Look how far we've come my baby     Tara    Current Music:  Promise Ring  Current Mood:  In Love  Quote of the Day:  I love you Ross...Happy Anniversary!
