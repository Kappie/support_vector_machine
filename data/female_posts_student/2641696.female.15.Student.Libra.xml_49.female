Someone  (on the student's council, no less!) was around 40 minutes late, so we had to wait for her. And then on the niner's bus someone forgot their uniform, and someone  else  forgot their passport, so apparently they were waiting for that, too. I was flipping out because I really, really didn't want to miss the Blue Man Group ^_^   Other than those few mishaps and a couple of god-awful traffic jams, the bus ride went pretty smooth. Watched a few movies, learned a few card games, sang a few songs, ate more than a few McDonald's fries and in general had a pretty good time. I've never seen Niagara Falls, and that was just incredible. And when we stopped, we wandered outside, which was nice -- I miss being outside ~v~ My computer tends to distract me, I'm afraid.   In the end, though, rather than going to the hotel for an hour to freshen up and such before the show, we just went straight to it.   And then... Oh. My. God. Oh my God!! Aiee!! That was the most incredible show I've ever seen in my life. I won't write what happens in the finale, in case you haven't seen it, but jumping jungle-cats, Batman... WOWIE. Unlike what some people thought (muahaha, I knew better), it wasn't a jazz show at all. Pure percussion. With funky neon glow-in-the-dark paint. And blue men. And absolute hilarity! You all know how I go on and on about Maynard and his bands A Perfect Circle and Tool... well, this show was like Tool personified. One of the things I love so much about Tool is the awesomely-fantasmical percussion, the really, really interesting sounds and music that you just don't hear in typical pop and emo and rock. Aiee!!   After that we just went back on the bus to check in at the hotel. Since the hotel wasn't even actually in Boston, that took a while more in the bus, but it was fun -- GA brought his guitar ( such  a good idea!), and a bunch of guys played and sang and it was just awesome. Guitars are cool. Guys who sing are cooler.   The hotel was surprisingly nice; really, really good pillows. Better than my pillows at home ^^; Had a nice sleep. Breakfast in the morning was good, too -- scrambled eggs, yadda yadda yadda, the usual.   Unfortunately, on the actual tour, I forgot my camera *doh* But Quincey Market was lots of fun, and the Aquarium was craziness, and I bought a squishy penguin and a necklace for my mum. The only downside was being dragged around by my darling roomies to shop at Victoria's Secret and AE and blah blah blah.. I dislike shopping intensely. Fortunately I soon convinced almost all of them (M ditched us to shop more ^^;) that the guys were having more fun interviewing and recording Americans on what is Manifest Destiny, do you think Canada should be the next American state, etc. etc. etc., so the day wasn't a complete loss ^^; Harvard was pretty cool too, though very ugly. McGill is way prettier.   There was also this awesome zapper game that I am just soo angry I didn't buy!! I totally beat everyone at it, and then I forgot to ask where JB got it from, and arrrgh!! Blech. Oh well ^^;   Also, Boston sundaes are good. Very, very, very good. And those mouse rugs were too cool for words (mouse pads, but ORIENTAL CARPETS with the little fringes and everything!!).   The gameshow thing at the hotel was the most boring, most lame and most utterly disappointing show ever. Ugh. I died that night ^^; Was pretty angry afterwards, seeing as we had to leave early right when the dance started because we had to compete the next day... *sigh*   The competition went really well. Lots of fun. Our bands didn't do as well as we hoped (silver all). But the choir got gold, and was first overall in the competition -- we're invited to Salt Lake City to sing with Mormons or something.. (???) Anyways, I got lots of great pictures, and it was insanely fun, and all that jazz.   The Salem witch museum wasn't that great, but hey, whatever. A got a mini Tarot card set, which was pretty cool. She was doing readings for everyone in our room (we had a mini-party, wee!) later that night.   The dance was fun too. I actually thought the music was better than normal; they played way more oldies than most. And everyone knows the oldies are the best songs. Of course the award ceremony beforehand was painfully boring. Those Americans have too much patriotism. I'm not quite sure if I got a pic of me in my nice clothes and all, but I did get one of everyone else, so. I know what I look like; doesn't matter too much ^^;   So yeah, we had fun in the hotel room afterwards, and then we went to sleep. Really nice pillows. Loved 'em.   Got up early the next day, had breakfast, got into the bus and soon were on our way. Poor P had to sit up way in the front *g* Played more cards, listened to more music, watched more movies. Wasn't that bad. And then we realized that the niner bus had disappeared. Yup, that's right. They ended up being 3 hours behind us. Called my mum on M's cell, fortunately, so instead of waiting outside for my sis to get there I just sat in the car and gushed about blue men... but still.   And now there is today. I'm skipping school, thank God, because I am so tired. And the Sens won last night (THAT'S RIGHT YOU FLEA-LOVIN RAGGAMUFFINS! GO OTTAWAAAAA!!). And I ended up going to bed at like 11:30, and I woke up at 12:30 (and only then because N was singing in the damn shower.. grr...). So, all in all, I don't really think the two measly days in Boston were worse the 10+ hours bus ride, the Blue Man Group made it all work out. Wow. They better come to Toronto soon ^^;   ...   READY GO   (8) I think I'm turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese I really think so...
