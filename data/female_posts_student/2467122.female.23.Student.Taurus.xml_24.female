And, as an added bonus, I am absolved of ALL my sins (which is a pretty good deal)!  Just reflecting on the importance the Catholic faith has had on all of my life's journeys.  Went to a discussion tonight on the  urlLink Voice of the Faithful , and was moved by the recognition that the church hierarchy needs to change, not the church community and that really resonated within me.    Just wanted to get that out there in the open.  *me*
