I wasn't stubborn to be stubborn. I feel like today was the first day I was able to talk to this person in a very long time with out being weird or not real. Honestly today was the first time I really was real. Today I proved to myself that I have indeed grown up. I thank this person for giving me a chance,, and I feel that today I proved myself to this person. I love you and my feelings for you will never change. Anyways I got to go. Hopefully I'll be on again before next weekend. Later  RJ
