If you want to see why check her blog, "I miss her already and she's not even gone" it's not a direct link becasue I am inept. All pact and ready, the cleaning frenzy wasn't too bad becasue my mom just really wanted me to focus on my room. Neadless to say my room finally did get cleaned, but not as organized as I would like.       yesturday I broke out in hives, so I'm going to have trouble in the car. Maybe I can make a game of trying to figure out which itchy spot is a hive and which is a legitamate bug bite. I determined that I had hives last night when my back spontaniously started braking out in itchy spots.       .........................I miss bethie. %&$*&.... I didn't think I'd dwell. But I am................      ..............Will not mention the fact that we came in last at the writer's convention contest.... Mostly 'cause I don't mind as much as I thought I would, that and my lovely assistant has said much of what I believe is true. We will succeed with this book regardless of how long it takes, it will happen.  If you want to read more on that Bethany Kind of had the last word.       This is so depressing bethany and I will be missing each other for like... two weeks. I should leave instructions for the writing of the chapters I'm leaving her with...      Especially for beth:        Finish what you've started with Laleena     Leave Fraser the bloody well alone!     Should you have troubles not editing after you finish Laleena Chapt. 15-16 move onto Taryne, make her longer and logical. [warning if I don't like it I will redo it, or you will, and then you will never hear the end of it!]          Leave the Fraser Laleena part to me in Chapters 17-18, I would actually like to do them     Should the need arise you may do Taryne Chapter 17,  not 18      Make Taryne more intense, have her knock a few people around, make some violent rememberances     Dwell on how quickly these pregnancies are comeing along     If worse comes to worse run through or novels for grammer and spelling as well as word use.         That's all I have for writing.        Should you miss me too much, Chad will open the door and let you in (Say that you want to borrow a book or something)      Should you need to borrow a book call ahead of time. You know where they are kept         If you don't want to seem wierd but you need a book, dear lord don't go to the library, that will just throw you right off course! Read Dracula. It will help you understand some of the laurell referances more easily. As well it may help you with your own writing.          If that doesn't appeal, read one of the classics that was thrown in your face by miss mathot.          Remember that I am most likely thinking of you so don't pout too bad.     HAVE FUN AT DEBATE CAMP YOU GEEK!     So that's it eth you list of instructions posted where you can see them. I hope you actually look at this sight before I come home. And you get back.      P.S. Tell your mother she probably won't see me when you are away because that is wierd :) and I'm sorry that I can't make it to the picnic ;)
