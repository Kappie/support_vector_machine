Aliesha, Jack and Bret all called last night and everything is set, so at 1:30 I am OUT of this stupid city.  Yesterday was not a very good day.  I sent a not so nice e-mail to a very beloved person and I feel horrible... I sent another, apologizing but I still feel like a jerk.  I'm still upset with everything though, so maybe this is a good thing... everything will be out in the open. ... wow that was vauge  So what better way to cap off a horrible weekend but with an AWESOME day down in Iowa w/ my buds from Camp?  I can tell you're excited for me... don't try to hide it.  So just a few more history notes to take (the joys of procrastination) and i can hit the road.
