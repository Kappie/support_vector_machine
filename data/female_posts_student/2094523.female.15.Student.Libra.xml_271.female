No one has a mind of their own its just this robotic world where all the minds are created in all the same manner. Just coz someone looks different or seem to act different they turn out to be just "another one of them." But what can we do? Lets walk down that same fuckin path again and again until we're satisfied.  Some people expect too much outta one person when theyre no fuckin better. Like i said everyone is the same so why do you expect so much outta me. i cant prevent who i am although i would love to at many times and u cant prevent who you are. I know im a failure at life why cant you understand it why do you have to expect me to be perfect. Im no good @ that im a sucky friend im a sucky person and yeah i am a fuckin sorry person. but what is anyone gonna do about that? you give and give and give till you're weak in every single cell inside of you and they still want more outta you. You can call me close to fuckin dead because maybe i am. maybe u killed my soul, my heart, well u sure as hell killed everything i ever believed in. Im outta here.
