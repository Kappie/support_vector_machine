Holy Shit, the acting was hystarical, and the it hit the nail right on the head!  The writing was phenomenol! I dont think I've seen a funnier show in my life.  The whole time the three of us are sitting there, deciding which sex-feined character we act like!  Well it was so blatenly obvious that Kate is Miranda, the lawyer/liberal/sarcastic sexaholic( well...minus the fact that all of us are virgins, so the whole sex thing is wrong!) Nicole is Charlotte York, the naive, less sexed, iffy of the whole one night stand situation, sex kitten, that goes for the tall, dark and handsome.  And I, well, we couldn't decide!  Sometimes we thought that I would be considered as Samantha, the sex kitten, that makes sex with a different guy a daily event. Except the part where I dont do that, Then we decided that I have the flirtatious abilities of Samantha, and not the SEX part.  That I am Carrie really, as a full character with the flirtatious abilities of Samantha! there ya go! Ahh the night was a blast, great "bonding" time!  haha nothing like cheese-its and raisinets in a 5 hrs period! Ahh havent eaten "real" food since lunch time! We talked about boys, what goes down at Nip/Tuck nights, and Ricciardi!  haha...Wow time for bed!  It's been a long day!  Goodnight
