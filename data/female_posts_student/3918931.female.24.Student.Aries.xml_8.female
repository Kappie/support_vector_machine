Allison, congrats on the job, give me a call.  Ki, thanks for hooking me up with this blog crap.  i feel like i'm in the loop :)  also, everyone needs to send me new addresses.  i am going to be sending invitations in the next couple of weeks and if you don't live in the same place we all did in college i have no idea where to send the invites.  talk to you all later.
