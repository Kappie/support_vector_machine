They are all natural, with no preservatives or artificial ingredients.  They are nontaxable and a renewable resource.  They are 100% wholesome and no batteries or tune-up needed.  They are safe in all kinds of weather. In fact, they are very good in cold or rainy weather.  They are effective in treating problems, like bad dreams and Monday blahs.  When you give a hug, you always get one right back.  Never wait till tomorrow to give a hug,  send one right now!!
