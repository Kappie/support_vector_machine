I just can't believe you'd undermine my position in life like that. God, I'm  weeping . Dear god, these wounds will never heal, it's time for me to die. Goodbye cold world.  Ok, so that was all BS, and now to the real, "j/k" version of me. Heya there Abby, me llamo Josh, and surprisingly, I'm not in Spanish, considering my vast vocabulary in that language...at least, my limited memory of the Taco Bell menu. Whatever.  Sarcasm is cool, it's good to have you here.
