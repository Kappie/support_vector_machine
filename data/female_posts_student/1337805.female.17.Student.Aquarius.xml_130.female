Mom hates it cause everything falls out, so there's a dark cloud over the whole fucking house. Peachy. Been yelled at number of times for the things we ruined at the haunted house, and other things. Mom seems to think I'm the youth advisor or something. All I do is relay the message to the group, adding the words" My mom's a bitch".  Yelled/angered at Tom today. He accused me of not moving on. HA HA HA. I laughed in his face. He was drunk though, and called me a bitch. No more Ms Nice Chick for him. He's called me retarded too. I'm almost glad it didn't work out for that. He also hates cats. He's done.  Speaking of moving on: Adam? I dunno. Really, I'm so messed up over feelings and junk. I'm just ignoring it now, casting it aside and worring about better things: The mess that claimed my room. I still don't think it's bad, hell it could be a lot worse.  I organized all my clothes drawers and my closet today. Whoo!  Hurray for the control-Y key, otherwise would have lost half of post. Stupid technology.   I'm so bored right now I'm thinking of re-sizing this template and actually completing it: Archives links, links to site-y things.. I also went to  urlLink Beki's site  and skillfully aquired many of her images.  Good job Beki!  Miss you like hellwater Adam. We need to work something out. Bad.
