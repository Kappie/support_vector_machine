Hmmph.    Had a conversation this morning in the kitchen about how  Angel  is ending and I was proud to say that I really didnt - no,  couldnt  - get into the show after watching a handful of episodes even though  Buffy  was one of my favorites... I just felt that Angel was just not quite good enough or smart enough.  Buffy put it to shame.  It was exciting, sassy, kinda scary at times and overall, well made.  Angel wasnt/isnt.  Sue me.    Then we talked about  CSI  vs.  CSI: Miami.   Oh, it's amazing the differences between the two shows.  It was like CBS thought that CSI may be too educationally advanced for some, so they dumbed it down and changed the location!  Oh, and added David Caruso whom I frickin' HATE.  He makes my skin itch!  [shudder]  Anyway, so I thought, let me write out the shows I watch on a regular basis and you guys can maybe comment or give me suggestions for watching something good I may be missing...or try and talk me out of watching what I already do.  (shameless plug for comments)   Shows I watch religiously (when its in season of course):   1.  24  on Fox.  If you dont watch it, you should.    2.  American Idol  on Fox.  LaToya.  Fantasia.  Jennifer.  'Nuff said.  3.  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  on Bravo.  I just LOVE the Fab Five!  And everyone is always soooo happy afterwards.  That said, the evil part of me wants to see a homophobe on and see how they deal.  4.  Significant Others  on Bravo.  A short like, 6 episode season to test the waters, this show has me literally slapping my thigh and guffawing its so funny.  I cant wait for it to come back!  5.  The Apprentice  on NBC.  Yeah, its over now, but I didnt miss an episode.  6.  Survivor  on CBS.  Steve got me into it and now I'm hooked.  Allstars, baby!  7.  CSI  on CBS.  I just love this show.  Mainly because its not always cut and dry at the end.  They dont always get the bad guy, and that's cool.  8.  Joan of Arcadia  on CBS.  I think its the most emotionally realistic show out there.  9.  Monk  on USA.  So good that ABC wanted to buy it.  So good that USA wouldnt sell it except as reruns.  10.   The Sopranos  and  Six Feet Under  on HBO.  These shows usually have me riveted and then they leave the air for what seems like years and come back only to do it to me again.  Its the great writing is what keeps me hooked.   Shows I try and catch:   1.  Sex and the City  - On Demand.  I'm up to Season 4 and I watch episodes whenever I feel like it.  2. VH1's  Best Week Ever  - I catch it when I catch it, and I usually catch it because they rerun it all weekend long.  3. Reruns of  Buffy  on F/X.  If I get home early enough I can catch Willow going all badass because Tara was killed!  4.  Cold Case  on CBS.  I always seem to forget its on, but for the most part I like the show.  5.  Touching Evil  on USA.  It started off very well with it being written and directed by the Hughes Brothers, but now its starting to get a trifle predictable.   Shows I wish I watched more often:   1.  The Simpsons .  Still funny after all these years but I always forget to watch it.  I usually catch up on the new season in the summertime, when everyone else is showing repeats.  ha-HA!  2.  Friends  and  Will  Grace .  Both great shows, but I cant bring myself to change the channel from 2 to 4 on Thursday nights.  I usually watch these in reruns too.   Well, what have you got to say for yourselves?  And scrap that "You need to get out more" comment that y'all are thinking about saying because I KNOW that.  I'm talking about television right now, not me.  Hmmph.
