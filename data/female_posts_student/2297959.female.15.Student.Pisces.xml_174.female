"some1" said something today at flex that really got me thinking... "you are praying for nonsense" That sentence is a pure lie because anything you pray for isn't nonsense because you yourself believe in it enough to tell God about it. That alone makes it make sense. Even if it something that doesn't make sense to others, it does to you. It is impossible to pray for nonsense. When you really think about it, it is actually rude to say.
