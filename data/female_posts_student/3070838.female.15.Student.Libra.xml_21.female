I will be sending you guys the address to some pictures once I've uploaded them on the computer. Today's horoscope:  Libra :  So things aren't perfect. Are they really that bad? If your big-picture outlook seems bleak, pay attention to the small stuff -- you've got a lot going for you, but you may not be giving yourself enough credit.   So true!!! My life is so complicated right now. But I guess I should be looking to the small stuff... Like, umm, my hair! It's so beautifully blonde from the sun. And, the fact that I have great friends, but that's hardly a small thing.  Luv u all, Phillidilly
