I'm taking part in the Walk For Life charity stroll. I've raised £51 so far, which is pretty good, considering this is my first ever charity thing. Yesterday, after the last exam of the week (pretty uneventful, but I think I'm going to get an A* for Business Studies). Afterwards I kicked myself into action, refusing to go home and sleep and pestering all the teachers. The most I got was £6.40(£5 add giftaid) but I just annoyed them. Unfortunately, I don't remember all of their faces, but I will...Dad's happy with it and he's pledging £15, gonna get m brother, my two neighbours...then I'll be meeting up Alice and her friends and we'll be on our way...is anyone else doing it? If so, good luck on the day and congratulations! I heard Liberty X is performing, I wonder if thats true...  Right now my Dad is on the phone to Aunty Babs-her daughter died on the 16th-she was only 25 and Denise died of terminal breast cancer. It's so sad, but I'm scared I'll have to face her. I have no idea how to act...its scary how things just go out of control(not because I knew her-is that selfish?).   A few days before I sent one my two best guy mates, Ashley a long letter telling him about my breakdown and that I needed him. He's a slow reader, but he started reading a bit of it last night, and hes being really great. Better than I thought, because he doesn't really speak to me lately, and we've been too quiet together (we're both Geminis). I've been talking to other best guy mate, Nik. He's fantastic. He really is. He's genuine and funny and caring and sincere and interesting, and a normal guy which doesn't make the whole internet situation something to just shout about. You see, I've never seen him: we met on stories.com (now  urlLink www.writing.com ) and everything progressed from there. We had a nightmarish, brief attempt at being boyfriend and girlfriend. We're almost made for each other, but definitely not like that! I used to call him, but hes not the best speaker so we use msn, but mines not working so we have to rely on email. He's still convinced that Enlgand have a chance at winning the Euro Cup(?) and predictably treats Rooney in high esteem cos of his two goals.... he's cool.   I feel nervous. Why? Because Ihaven't told Dad that the charity treats people with HIV/AIDS and that the walk is in Central London. He used to think AIDs was a gay disease and I don't know if hes changed his mind.  Aussi,   he doesn't like me going into Central London-he has a sexist view of women with maps...I'm going whether he likes he or not. This is something I have to do-its probably one of the most selfless things I've ever done-after all, there's no such as a completely selfless deed.   Finally, I might be on the 'bill' for the Pink Parade. There's an event in Cambridge on the 28th August where young gay people will be performing poetry, songs, scripts etc, to prove how fabulous we are! It'll be the first time - ever! - that I will be performing any works of mine in public. So I'll definitely keep you posted with that...I found a site for it:  So thats a date.  Write up, later. And please, please, please times a million, if you are reading this, comment! I feel like I'm on a virtual reality island...   urlLink www.walkforlife.com  -that is the Walk For Life site-I can't get my hyperlink to behave.   urlLink www.pinkpicnic.co.uk   That is the link for the pink picnic, but I can't get that to behave either...I like to work though...sometimes.
