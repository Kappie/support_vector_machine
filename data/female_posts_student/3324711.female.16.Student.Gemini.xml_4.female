So if you dont like me being this happy maybe you should stop reading, because morgans emo days are over! [for now]  Anyway, we got our band sweaters today! Im not usually one for school spirit or anything but I used to wear my brothers everyday, and you all know how crappy and beat up it got. It was my favourite sweater, and then my mom threw it out [this she denies but I know the truth.] But all that is over and done with because I finally got my own! Did I mention that life is amazing?  Speaking of amazing, I went to Behns after school today and we walked around aimlessly, and went to go visit ricky and debbie!! [kathryn hoods parents.. they love me dearly]. It was awesome, I miss them so much.. this all brings back so much memories. Plus just being with Behn made my day :) hes stellar. And going away on a band trip this sunday.. which blows, specially since hes away for his birthday, but we're planning a huge party [well I am haha] when he gets back. I was thinking either toga party or jam party? Itll probably end up being a jam party which is awesome, but someone has to have a toga party sometime! do you realise how swickedly amazing that would be?
