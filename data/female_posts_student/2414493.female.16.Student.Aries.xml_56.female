At this odd hour, I look at my arm and I all of a sudden marvel at flesh and bone. And existence. And I think, wait, this isn't right. I'm still here, why bother? And God takes out his trident...and spears me. I'm beginning to sound like Erum, half asleep. "Altar, English homework." I like the static and the crackle and the craziness and just sitting here, so tired but so in awe.  I am counting friends again. It's insane. Are friends just people you can talk to and talk to? Are they the ones who hold me up no matter what mood I'm in? Are they the ones who write and write and write to me when I write to them? How do you lose them? When you cut them off, is that final?   Per Battaglia's observation, Lydia gets vulgar when it's late and she's stressed. So I am a comfort whore. Anything for just feeling all right again when I'm upset. IT could be in the form of someone--some people--I rarely talk to, or food, or just writing in this odd collection of thoughts.
