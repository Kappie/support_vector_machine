She was like an angry bull. Ok. Nvm she was cute. We were the only class that didnt know how to dance properly and had to watch other classes dance. Our mass dance teacher was EVEN WORSE? I cant rmb her beautiful name. But she is lovely. She wore the same pants everytime (blue in colour) and she loved her sling bag so much she carried it wherever she went. Our class will just stone and ignore her when she was trying to teach us the steps. I told you we were a cool class. We cldnt be bothered with her.    Rmb how we slept during CME class in sec 3? Yeahyeah. We rocked. We made Khoo Shui Lian (mrs khoo) so pissed when we slept. And she will slam the books on the table..and shout out..I AM  NOT  ANGRY. And stormed out of the class just because Tertia killed a bee for the safety of the class. Hahah. And Mrs Ow...GIRLSSSSSS KHEEEPPPPPP QQQQQQQUIET!!!!! in her really weird and high pitched choir voice. Then she will make her shoulders go up and down up and down and up forever. And we love to imitate her voice screaming KHEEEEEEEEPP  QUIETTTTTTTT GIRLSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!! And do her shoulder thing. It was the most in thing to do that. Hahah. GWS she once said Wong Xi looked like a Darlie the toothpaste advertisement. My goodness. Speaking of wx, she used to flood the room with her tissues. And Eudora once brought a tissue box and hang it on the wall. Free flow for anyone like lauren rage or wx to have some tissues. Our class is very auntish you see. =) But we are high class aunties. And Ms Lee( ok. Janet Lee.) She's cute huh? Forever laughing at her own jokes. And we laughed along only becos she looked funny laughing by herself. She thot we were laffing at her jokes.   Here are some food our class loves to eat.  Everything.   Ok just kidding.    We love to ta bao chicken rice. Buy back hot hot nuggets from the malay store. Or buy the stupid pizza from the western stall. We also loved to drink packet drinks like milo or ice lemon tea( althou i hate ice lemon tea) or we drink lime juice. And we love to buy back chicken sandwiches egg sanwiches and chicken seaweed. We consume a lot and therefore, it is highly dangerous for other classes not to eat before our recess. After our recess, it is unlikely you find anymore food in the canteen. We have chomped down the whole canteen alr. After eating we love to take a nap in class during lessons. After napping we feel very refreshed and it's time to go home alr.    We love to tsk at any outsiders coming into our class during lessons. Not that we love lessons a lot. But we tsk with mighty echoes for the thrill of it. We get aroused easily by our TSKS YUCKS ERBX BURPX. We like to have peace when we are doing work/tests and will TSK YUCKS ERBX BURPX at whoever makes noise outside. But the moment we finish, even if other ple are having exams, we love to make a lot of noise. Complete with our TSK YUCKS ERBX BURPX as we walk along their classes.    Hey, did I mention before that we are a cool class?   What do you think??   NO need to think la. It IS THE COOLEST. HOR?   =)
