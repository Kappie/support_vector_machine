My nan is the youngest of six kids and now there is only her brother left and he lives on the other side of the country with his wife who has alzeimers. My nan and her sis were like best friends they have shared so much giref together watching their 3 sisters die - 2 had dementia - so sad. Aunty Lee died of Cancer - and she was only recently diagnosed - within 2 months - the docs opened her up to find that she was riddled with it. No hope for her unfortunately. Its weird for me because Im pretty sure it has been forever since I stayed at my nans - I wonder if it has been a subconscious thing - I was there when she found out that her eldest son Phil - my uncle had committed suicide 7 years ago. And I seriously wouldnt be surprised if that was the last time I stayed there. Maybe its fate maybe its whatever - maybe I was just supposed to be there to help nan through the hard times again... Who knows?  I'm not sure whether Ive said this before or if its in my profile but I play footy - Aussie Rules football... I used to love it SO much but last year I was the President of the Leage and if anything can steal your love for a game - its doing all the work for the league while a bunch of ingrates whinge and bitch and moan at you for everything that is wrong with the league. Anyway we played yesterday I play for the Piranhas - we used to be the premiers ( we won back to back to back premierships 1999,2000,2001) and we have lost every game this season. We are getting stubby holders made up that say "Once were Premiers" - I think its good that we can laugh about it. I hurt my middle finger of my right hand - and left me tell you that it seriously is not that easy to type and actually do most stuff with and injured middle finger. I dont think its broken but it hurts like hell and is swollen a little - I tried to take photo of it but I dont think the photo gives it justice.   My little sister is moving house today - she has been living with our cousin but they have had one too many falling outs so Bec is moving out by herself. Which is good but sux cause she wants all her shit back - her futon couch/bed - that I use for guests when they stay over - which is quite often living in a house of 4 and she is also taking my fridge. What Am I going to use I hear you say? Its cool we have a big one inside - we got a new one when Dieter moved in. So the fridge bec is taking is the outside drinks fridge so now we have no drinks fridge!! ARGH! We will have to make to do buy not buying as much food i suppose ;) haha  Speaking of dieter its his Birthday today and I have to buy him a present.. he is a lovely guy very fashionable - he has REALLY good taste in clothes - when I first met him I thought he might be gay - but after living with him and picking his brain we all have concluded that he isnt. He just has great taste in clothes - he comes under the banner of Metrosexual. SO I have to get him something cool but inexpensive. Maybe some new boxer shorts - he gets around in them fairly often - also loves to take his shirt off our deet, even when its freakin freezing he will walk around the house with no shirt on.... strange lad.   Alright well I think I have babbled on long enough about pretty mundane stuff.. Ciao til next time
