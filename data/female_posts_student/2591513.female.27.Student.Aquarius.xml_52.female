My mom has been having bad relapses since us buying this house....looks like the doctors are a little concerned about her.  They are doing another MRI on her.  I can tell she is nervous about it.  I HATE my cousin for doing this to us, for risking my mom's health fo rhis financial benefit.  I hope he gets back all he has given us and then some.
