Out. of love? of her favor where i am in love!" -Romeo and Juliet "I am afeared being in night all this is but a dream" -Romeo and Juliet but really Shakespeare in Love "If i could write the beauty of her eyes i was born to look in them and know myself" -Shakespeare in Love "This is not life, Will. This is a stolen season" -Shakespare in Love "I wish i had a pot [belly]... if i had one, id wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it" -Pulp Fiction "'Millie? Does the White Clown love you?' No answer. 'Millie, does--' He licked his lips. 'Does your 'family' love you, love you  very  much, love you with all their heart and soul, Millie?" -Fahrenheit 451 "Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out." -Protestant martyr Lancaster? i dont remember how to spell his name or if that was his name for sure...so ill look it up and fix it later.  yeah...those are just things ive been thinking about lately...i dunno... some profound...some not.
