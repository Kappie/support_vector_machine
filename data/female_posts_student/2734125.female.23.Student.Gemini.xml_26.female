Its an odd kind of rest that sits like a heavy meal after days of pushing to the limit; comforting, but stoney and a little painful.  I have to sit on two phone books to be at the proper height to type.    I dreampt of waves the other night.  I dream of them a lot, recurring.  The sea is chaotic, huge waves that are ten, twenty or fifty feet high.  When I was young they used to be tsunami's, but now they are just a wild ocean.  It is always in a cove, or sea cave, or inlet.  The color of the light might be dusk, but its not.  It is a different realm.  It is shades of brown, and still has color.  The ocean in this place is always loud, and I am looking at the waves from the beach.  Soon there are others there, walking.  Sometimes there are people in the water, sometimes I brave the water, and the waves lift you up in a feeling of uncontrollable panic and then back down.  The other night I was afraid that Dylan would get taken by the undertow, I was hit several times, but I made it to the far side of the cove where people were watching the sea from behind a rock outcropping.  Dylan almost made it but was hit by a wave.  I was terrified, and then it hit her, and she was barely lifted off her feet and set back down.  In that dream, during a different part, there was a boy fighting a dragon.  He turned it to ice and when it melted it made a pond.  I cried last night before falling asleep.  I haven't done that for a while.  My chest just ached, if you know what I mean.  It was with an everything that I wasn't prepared for, memories that I hadn't prepared for.  I should have known.  Coming home is never the same, but its always seeped in things that might have been a shadow, and things that smell like dried lavender, slides of your past you want or want away that want you to see them.  There are days when I wake up smelling the future, sage and smoke and sweat and raspberries, just out in front.  Its so real when its there.  I don't think that I can describe the longing and physical tension, a thought before an erotic shiver, keeping me tight and ready for every second that is to come.  I become so deeply enchanted with possibility: possibility.  Every way, in the moment, the everything nothing flash of un questioned fluttering gasping throat lowe rback and upper thigh sigh of possibility.  Then there are days when my subconscious plays back Morgan home movie classics over and over, till I feel like I am folding in, and I am afraid.  I am afraid of all those lost moments that I was so excited about, and how they are now held still in frames of my mind.  Like a thousand million butterflies that might be, condensed into one green brown moth that was.  Not that I don't try to live, and there are some irridesent winged moments of my short life, but sometimes life gets in the way of living.  So I cried, and felt cold in my parents house on a role away bed.  I felt lonely.  It hurts, trying to keep my eyes opened, trying to stay awake with this pressure on, its worth it, but it hurts...
