I'm thinking it's not a good thing for me to be this sick though.  I didn't eat yesterday.  (haha, y'all are like -GASP-)  I almost hurled at breakfast; eggs are not your friend when sick.  Then I struggled though to the night on just Diet Coke.  But when I saw The RunDown at 7.00 I felt much better and ate a ton of Nibs.  And some of Tiff's popcorn.  And a lot of Rootbeer.  Yea that's a healthy day's worth of food.  Oh, did I mention that I turned down my Dad's pear pie.  That's how shitty I felt.  I'm feeling quite a bit better today though.  I'm still not eating.  Maybe I'm just having one of my unintentional food boycotts.  I do that from time to time.
