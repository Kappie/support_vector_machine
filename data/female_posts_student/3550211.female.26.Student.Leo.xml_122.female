You have to remember that the novels and short stories, and poems that I am reading were written either before or between the World Wars, so female and male space at that time was significantly structured. Women were meant to occupy the domestic sphere while men spent their time in the public sphere. Fucked up? Yes of course. And I thank the early women's movement for bringing about change. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not some crazy psycho feminist. As a women, yes of course, I believe in women's rights. But I'm no Gloria Steinem, that's for sure.   But I'm off topic. The only reason I am writing on this topic is because we have been reading so many stories about repressed women, so my research will be fruitful. Of course, if any of you have any opinions on feminism, I would love to hear them.   I also would like to point out, that I think David Fincher should turn the short story "The Yellow Wallpaper," by Charlotte Perkins Gilman into a movie. If he updated it - oh boy! I think it could be better then Fight Club. Seriously. It's a twisted story. If you haven't read it, I suggest you do. In fact, you can read it  urlLink here  online.
