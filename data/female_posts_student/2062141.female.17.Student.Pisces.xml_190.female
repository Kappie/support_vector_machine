Not really because I felt very sick, I mean my throat and my nose ('dose') is stuffy but I wouldn't have died. I just couldn't face the day, I was so tired, and I really, really hate school. I wish I could fake sick until June 21 but sadly I don't think that'd be possible. I found out today that my senior year of school starts the week BEFORE labor day weekend. That really sucks. I have the Prince concert the night of the first day of school. Then that weekend, it's Bumbershoot which we'll DEFinitely not be able to go to anymore, and of course, the DAVE MATTHEWS concert that we'll have to leave early early for on Saturday and get back on Monday is THAT weekend. I wanted to go to Bumbershoot too (Char! Our tradition must NOT be broken! Even though it's totally impossible and impractical! DAMMIT). And... I don't want to write my research paper that's 8 pages and due on Friday. Sigh.  I made a mix-cd today... I'm proud of myself. The list (for lack of anything else to say):  1. Amber   -   311 2. Kiss Me   -   Sixpence 3. Crash Into Me   -   Dave Matthews Band 4. In My Place   -   Coldplay 5. Yellow   -   Coldplay 6. Shiver   -   Coldplay 7. Clocks   -   Coldplay 8. You Never Know   -   Dave Matthews Band 9. Something   -   The Beatles 10. Here, There and Everywhere   -   The Beatles 11. Parachutes   -   Coldplay 12. Everything's Not Lost   -   Coldplay 13. Come Back to Bed   -   John Mayer 14. City Love   -   John Mayer 15. Without the Girl   -   Daniel Bedingfield 16. Hey Love   -   Jason Mraz  I'm not sure what the theme is but I likes it!
