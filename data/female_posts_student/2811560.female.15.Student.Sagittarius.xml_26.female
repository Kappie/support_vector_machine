We have to learn really stupid choreography to a really stupid song. Don't believe me? The song is called "Razamajazz". Yeah its pretty bad. And the people who make up the steps always have to explain it in the most complicated way possible. Didn't try out for One Acts today like I thought, too lazy so I just came home. Meh, I'll go Thursday. So we have testing tomorrow which is cool because we get a half day. Not cool because testing sucks. I honestly wouldn't mind if we had to take something that was required by the state or something, but seriously, a Learning Styles Inventory? Come on now. Can you say waste of time? Anyways Jeff and I might go to Westfield jazz band tomorrow. And I might go to this play at Drury Lane. Still just trying to get through the week, as usual. Oh, and I talked to Chris Barnum online tonight. EXCITING! Lol, he's a pretty cool guy for being a teacher and all. Meh.
