I can feel the blisters. Ow.   I'm beginning a road trip tomorrow. I'm traveling to Tennessee with my sister and maternal grandparents to visit relatives I haven't even met yet. Key terms: air conditioning, CDs, pools, great-aunts and uncles, motels, the alphabet game*, Southern drawls, grapes and cheese crackers (car food), too-much-nearness suffocation. And  naps . There are going to be enough of these that this word deserves special attention. I'm pretty psyched right now (I love riding in cars), but I know the novelty will be gone after the first week (I'm going for 16 days). Oh well. At least packing will be fun.   The last two days have kind of sucked. I've been doing dishes, and cleaning, and making lunch for everyone, and then washing the dishes from that, and then reminded not to mess up my room, since I  always  do. Gee, Dad. Thanks so much. Now I have tons of incentive to keep it neat. I got a break today when I went to the mall with Natalia. I had a really excellent time, though I didn't buy anything. Short list of activities: tried on ridiculous shoes, tried on perfume, ate mustard samples in a gourmet food store, ate chicken samples in the food court, tried on clothes in the Gap, looked through posters in Newbury Comics, and browsed in Borders. I stayed after she did, but I could tell it was time to go home when I was shifting from foot to blistered foot and thinking the same thought over and over again. I was tired enough already that riding home practically killed me.   Mmph. God. I'm supposed to go wash dishes now. I was only allowed to leave after I promised to wash dishes later. I feel like utter crap- this sucks. If this entry is all over the place, it's because of the fatigue.   *Alphabet Game, The: A car game that may be played by two or more people. The object is to find all the letters of the alphabet on road signs before your opponents. Two people cannot use the same letter on the same sign. The letter does not need to be at the beginning of the word. Anything with letters on it counts- street signs, graffiti, license plates, notices in windows, etc. Example- 'X' can be found in 'Exit'; 'Q' can be found in 'Grand Marquis'. I don't care if this is confusing. My feet hurt.
