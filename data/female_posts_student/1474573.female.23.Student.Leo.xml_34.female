You won't come out a winner by going up against command central, but are likely to damage your image and reputation. As tiresome as it is, you're advised to obediently stroke the status quo for the time being. Remember Leo: no matter how brilliant your message, if others are unwilling to listen, you're wasting your time. Wait until a more fortunate moment to unleash your beliefs and findings. This morning is friendly enough - just enough to ratchet up your confidence and seduce you into believing that you can speak freely. Don't be fooled, Leo - mum is the word.
