(stupid motherfuckers!) he wants me to go meet him..but i dont like the idea..i dont like age gaps either..he's 4 years older than me..i dont like age gaps..they have that maturity that i cannot still compensate with..but he knows how to go with my flow..he doesnt stray..i like talking to him..i keep on charging the cordless phone so i could talk to him at night coz he's got a job..BUT STILL I DONT LIKE THE AGE GAP! i text him every now and then.i misscall him all the time. wonders bout what he's doin'.gets mad at him when he doesnt reply. he says sorry when he doesnt. he acts like a child when he talks to me..immitates that of a baby i suppose..SO WADDYA THINK?! this new LOVE or just a gush of emotions..?  --------------------------------------  dilemma  currently facing a dilemma..the guy before was not in like with me but with someone else.actually he said he likes me but the one he likes aside from me came in the picture first so he likes her more than me.normally that would've been ego shattering in some way coz the reason was so "mababaw"?,but i couldn't care less now.he calls me at around 11 at night, just last night he did,just to tell me that he and the girl went out yesterday and the girl asked him to buy her something coz it was her birthday.of course he obliged.but after that the girl was giving him "alibys"(is this correct?!) like she can't talk to him yesterday coz her mom got mad at her for not coming home early and today she has some "interview" "workshop" or whatever that is,and she can't talk to him coz she won't be at home.he was restless.didn't know what to think,and i out of the goodness of my heart(yeah right),gave him advices.i didn't get irritated with ayt?i don't like him that much pa naman kasi.simple "like" lang.what irritated me was that he couldn't make up his mind! if he thinks the girl's just playin with him it would be better if he forgot her move on! ang kulit kasi nya! nakakaasar yung katatanung nya kung anung gagawin nya! in the first place kita naman nya yung ugali nung girl e! hingan ka ba naman ng load e di naman kayo magkakilala? DUH!?!? tas ngayon di sya mapakale kasi nakakapanghinayang daw. sobrang badtrip kasi katangahan nya yon! ako naman tanga din kasi kinausap ko pa! but that's not my actual dilemma.gusto ko lang magkwento.hahaha my real dilemma is that i like this guy,he says he loves me,but i think other wise..he hasn't seen me yet. ang lamang ko sa kanya is that i saw his picture na.kaya when i say i like him at least there's some truth in that diba?he's a known karirista...sinabi nya sakin lahat ng naging x nya,and some of them i've seen na..others i know..kaya nagdadalawang isip ako kasi lahat ng x nya sexy,maganda..yun bang pwedeng "irampa"? paginentertain ko yung feelings nya pareho lang kaming masasaktan.kasi gusto na nyang tumino e what if daw ako yun pinadala na magpapatino sa kanya.kaso yun nga di pa nya ko nakikita..what if magkita kami di nya ko gusto..e di umasa din ako..mas masasaktan ako kasi di naman ako yung mangiiwan..sya..diba?kaya nalilito ko..i like him..and im starting to fall..but as much as possible i wanna supress the feeling..i just want to avoid being hurt..i know that sureal..pero kahit na..sino ba namang tanga ang gustong masaktan?i like him..i like him..and i think its better if i just don't tell him..  ----------------------------------  it's getting harder.. (no!not what's in between his legs!T_T)  He hates me! (well,i THINK he hates me..) he saw me post something at the chatroom and he thinks im like that.. said he thought that i was different..well I AM! i just place that so peepz would pay attention to my message (hekz!) and some did pay attention and let's just i didn't expect him to see that AND ACTUALLY GIVE A REACTION!!! he was pissed of! he hated me! He said i made him feel bad..and i was so sorry for that..i didnt mean to give him that impression..im not like that..i believe in KARMA! ayoko ng maulit yung nangyari sa kin dati noh!T_T asar talaga! di ko alam kung bakit hinahabol ko pa sya! dapat nga lumalayo ako kasi di kami bagay! sa harap ng ibang tao ang kalalabasan non is makapal ang mukha ko! im worried bout his reputation..not myself..but him..martir noh?pero yoko naman kasi umasa e..ako din kawawa..diba?    they may be senseless to you but to those who "know" the real me they know my posts aren't senseless they know what hardships in love i've gone through..next time maybe i'll tell ya'll bout it. i don't need simpathy..i just want to let it all out.
