It'll be the best way to end summer! Yay I'm so excited. Except... it's so far away. Dammit. Oh well. I now have something to look forward to.   Last night I finally found something to do and slept over at Amanda's. It was so lame... we were both tired, and we were like man it must be like 2... but it was 11:15. So we struggled to stay up til midnight.. then we slept. Pretty intense, huh? But I wasn't stuck in my house all night. ..But now I have nothing to do tonight. >;@
