I didn't even know I had written it till the next day when I took a look at some of the photos on my blog.  b) It's MY blog so I am going to f-ing post whatever the hell I feel like  c) I leave the shit up there so I can come back months later and laugh at myself  d) IT'S MY BLOG!  e) F U!  f) and if in the future I choose to write another long passage and it bothers you that I've done so... whether I am drunk or sober... skip over it or don't read it at all, no tears will be shed from my eyes if I come to find out YOU didn't like what I posted or better yet didn't read it at all.  g) I AM MAKING THIS LONG JUST TO PISS YOU OFF  h) It's MY BLOG!  i) I could keep going through the whole alphabet  j) I'm actually not upset... just retaliating...  k) You can think whatever you want about my posts, my life, my emotions at the time which I do willingly spill... not always but sometimes... but don't begin to pretend that you know me or can categorize me from what you read here.  l) IT'S MY F-ING BLOG!
