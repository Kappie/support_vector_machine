When we got there, there were scary people doing drugs outside of their cars, and of course, Danielle decided to pull up right in front of them.  They kept staring at us so we decided to park elsewhere.  Amazingly enough, there were other groups at the basketball courts too, so we didn't feel too weird.  I discovered that I could not dribble a basketball for the life of me!  The concept seems so simple--just bounce the ball between your hand and the ground.  I guess I'm just dribble-challenged.  We  got tired of that and decided to swing.  After a while, these roughty kids--mostly boys, but about two girls--stormed the adjacent playground and horsed around on that twirly thing that spins.  Then all of the sudden they sprinted down the bike trail.  Just then, a cop car pulled up and the officer started to approach us.  Not connecting 1 and 1, we thought that we were violating curfew because it was 11:30 or something.  So we gathered up our things are started to head for the car.  The officer actually stopped us and asked us questions about the kids who ran.  What did they look like, how  many, what were they doing, etc. We showed him their cars and he and some other officer actually waited for them.  I wanted to see what would happen but we had to leave because he said the park closed at 10pm.  Darn.  So that was my adventure last night.  Pretty intense compared to the "nothings" that usually happen to me.  Anyhoo, I'm off to the gym to run with my new Nikes!
