Long before I had a choice of what movies to see, I don't remember exactly at what age that was maybe as early as my elementary grade school - my father have introduced  me to Sean Connery, Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson. Back then there was no rating and  kids just tag along.  Boy are these guys as old as my father????  My father is now 80 and I'm going to see him again this trip. We used to take special trips to the city (as we live in a barrio) with only one movie theathre, so we can go see this kind of movies in first run theathres...  Of course that kind of bonding seized, when  later in high school -I hated him for scaring the boys away (just like Bronson in his movies).  Now when Ric sees an old   Charles Bronson movie, he  says theres Papang Joe.  Sean  Connery is even sexier now, I guess because of how he has aged. Not many men can aged that well.  And Clint Eastwood???.
