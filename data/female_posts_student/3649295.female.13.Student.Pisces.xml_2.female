At lunch we continued playing D  They kept on acting like fools, but we all had fun.  My friend was doing his Test makeup correction sheet while playing.  During the game I rolled for the random monster encounter and it spawned a Blue Dragon.  They got pretty surprised (even though it is only a Wyrmling).  Anyways, my friend (there are 3 people playing D with me Nick, who is my friend nick’s sister and Nat who is in my math class) Nick wants me to DM an entire 3-month quest.  That will be a challenge.  But before that something happened in-between my hopeful girlfriend (Meghan Heid).  When we were walking to lunch, I forgot my backpack in the class, so I asked her to wait up for a minute while I went to go and get it.  I didn’t expect her to wait for me, I thought that she would just run off with her other friends, but she waited for me.  During bobcat time, which I stated before that bobcat time is in your homeroom class; I helped her clean out our classroom.  I wonder if I ask her to go out with me if she will.  After school I had to do a makeup test for math.  It ended up being the study guide because my teacher didn’t have enough time to make up a test.  It still took me about 50 minutes, but it wasn’t hard.  After that I came home and jumped in the shower because I had a band concert that night.  Meghan is in band to so I saw her in the concert.  But I only said hi.  Doh!  I should have started to flirt with her. Well I had my chance.
