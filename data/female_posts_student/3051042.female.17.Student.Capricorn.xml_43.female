It'd just be nice and respectful.  As for today, I don't really know. I woke up really late, I was going to attend 5th hour, but then Gareth and Michelle appeared from the East Wing doors of the school and we went to Starbucks. I came to 6th hour, and watched senior speeches. I'm going to miss Stephen like no other. Ever since 10th grade, when I met him, he was a cool guy.... only I had a crush on his scrawny ass back then. lol.   So I was sort of inspired to write my own little senior message thing... Give me a break, I have a year to go. My round up of the years past...  One year left, yup. One year until this hell is over. But to tell you the truth I don't know why I call it hell, because I've grown attached to high school. It's really where most of my life has taken place... and that's probably because I'm there 10 months a year, 5 days a week, 6 hours a day. That, or everything relates somehow to my high school life.    Freshman Year:  I was young and alone, and getting into this huge school of too many people that were too old to hang around some little freshman girl. I associated myself with friends that I'd known from years past. Returning to my former schools only once to talk of childhood with my old teachers. I can't believe that Mrs. Williams still remembered me from 1st, 3rd, and 4th grades; or how Mrs. Rust is now gone, or even how Mrs. Johnston still has those old Garfield posters still up on the wall. My freshman classes consisted of Computer Aided Drafting, College Preparatory Biology, Algebra, Varsity Band, Honors English 9, and US History. In my CAD class I usually slept, or talked with those who I'd known from the robotics team. I was booted off of inventor to work with Jeremy Knox on 3D Studio Max. Mr. Meyer was the coolest teacher in the world, and I will never forget that one eye-brow hair that I just wanted pluck off his god damn face. lol. In CP Bio, I met Nick (Marc's nephew) and played GameBoy, as they toyed with their stupid Tech Decks. I met this girl, Sarah French, and tried to help her through her tough time as a sophomore. We didn't really spend a lot of time together until my sophomore year. In Algebra, I goofed off with the other Nick, met Michelle Colon's sister Nikki (who was doing announcements at the time). She suggested for me to read Swimming Sweet Arrow, so I did and that's actually where the thought of sex began... sadly. I had my petty fights with Sally, befriended her for the sake of Cassie and I's relationship, but that slowly went down the tubes too. To band I would go, before lunch, and Leach was the best director on the face of this planet. We were the suckiest band in the school, but his lectures and stories only made me try harder to be the best performer in the class, and that got me into Symphonic Band the following year. Unfortunately, the teacher that I loved got the job of his dreams at another school. Shortly after his departure I went to visit him at Pioneer High in Ann Arbor during my sophomore year. After befriending Michelle in my US History class, she introduced me to Keith, and we all became friends. In Honors English, I met Zakk and Isaac, I originally thought that Zakk was gay and Isaac was sorta cute... but I had my eyes set on the 19-year-old Allen Vasher at the time. Zakk turned out to be quite a character, and an acquaintance. While Isaac didn't get to really know me until Marching Band this past year. In 6th hour, US History, I met this chick, Michelle. I didn't, at first, realize that she was the sister to Nikki (in my Algebra class). We dicked around, and Mr. Burnett was the coolest, never took an exam... ever. Got all A's for sitting and talking about history, it was the best class in the world. After school I was sent into my professional life as a member of the YHS robotics team. Learning everything I could I dedicated my life to that team for the longest time. Who would have known that my second year, as a high school freshman, would be my last. As I broke away my ties from a group I had originally proclaimed as my family brought me to loneliness, but Keith and Michelle slowly filled the void that had been created from heartbreak, as my naive little mind believed that my disfuctional family had betrayed me. Fortunate for me, the guy I fell for, Allen Richard Vasher, decided to date my immature little ass... and so things began there. My freshman year ended with a bang, plans for summer events were brought up, being hit with water balloons filled with detergent during seniors last day, and smoking too much pot over the summer... yet never getting stoned.   Sophomore Year:  Michelle and I's falling out over the summer reintroduced me to Cassie and with that came Tamika, Sarah, and Leah. The class line up? Honors English 10, Symphonic Band, Advanced Algebra, College Preparatory Chemistry, Geometry, and Government / Forensics. Waking up, and seeing Mrs. Griffin (SHE'S A BIRD!!!) was not the most interesting of mornings in my entire life, but I slowly lived through the agony that was English. The only English class I almost failed, it just sucked... there was nothing interesting or amusing about that class... well, with the exception of playing jokes on the Mrs. Griffin / Griffelkin / SHE'S A BIRD!!!. Symphonic Band, a new director, who I learned to hate. We still sucked, just more. And this time there was little motivation to stay in the class. Some how by the end of the school year, Rudi, Amelia, Katie, and others had conveniently convinced me to sign the papers for Marching Band my junior year. Chemistry was exciting, I met a new best friend, Tamika, in the process. Tie-Dye, Mr. Krause explaining how polystyrene bursts into flames, memorizing the table of elements (which I just realized was on Henk and I's place-mats as children), barely passing the class, Honda motorcycles, Tiki and I hoarding all the chemistry equipment in our storage drawer, and Happy HONIFBRCL (hon-if-brick-el, pronounced properly. My brother at least knows what I'm talking about). Geometry was a bore, slept through most of it, had Tamika again, and people wonder why we're friends now... jeeze. I couldn't get away from the girl! jk jk I    Junior Year:  The first semester passed by so fast, mainly thanks to Marching Band. I got buff from lifting equipment. My van was constantly packed full of instruments, parked up on the sidewalk, and blasting music. The speakers are now ripped. Damn stock speakers. I switched class schedules just about as much as I switched hair colors. I never really had time to adjust to the teachers or get really involved with them, well at least not until second semester... Where I learn that Mrs. Otwell is awesome, and Kellman takes too much shit from us. This was the year of change. I made amends with Michelle, started hanging out with my brother, and became a real party girl. Near the beginning of the year, I was so certain nothing was to change, but now I'm just waiting for things to lead me in different directions, for things to change and for me to take the flow of the current.. I'm excited for senior year, but dreading it. This is going to be my last year to possibly get my shit together before going off into the real world. But hanging around a bunch of college kids makes the transition seem less daunting.  One more year. This is it. I'm excited. Bring it on...
