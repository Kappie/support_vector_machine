Hahaha what a night.   lie awake wondering  if things could have been much different  second chance whats become  of a friendship if you can call this one  stayed in touch stood behind  while i gave you space  and you invade mine while  everyone makes mistakes   you let me down for the last time  truth prevails  and theres nothing you can hide  and i wash my hands of you  getting on with my life   wanna call and catch up  but no matter what i know you still suck  took the drugs from my friends  whatever were you thinkin?  stayed in touch stood behind  while i gave you space  and you invade mine while  every one makes mistakes....   you let me down for the last time  truth prevails  and theres nothing you can hide  and i wash my hands of you  getting on with my life   you let me down for the last time  truth prevails  and theres nothing you can hide  and i wash my hands of you  getting on with my life   if the shit remains the same  it makes no difference  in this stupid world we know  you let me down for the last time  truth prevails  and theres nothing you can hide  and i wash my hands of you  getting on with my life......    I like that song. I like the lyrics. It's a great song.  Well, I'm outta here crazies. Have fun.
