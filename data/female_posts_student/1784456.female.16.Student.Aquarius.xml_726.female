Eeek, I'm being out blogged by Laura! (Lol, god I'm sad!) But any way, we need to find out when every one's going on holiday and stuff and arrange... things! Today was very fun wasn't it? Oooh! Last day tomorrow! Yeay! We'll be in year 10 next year... hmm, that's kind of scary! And my brother will be in year 12! That's even scarier! Oh nooo! He'll be one of the scary six formers that walk around! :O Hehe... but you lot are just Rik's-sisters-friends! Ha! Step down from being Rik's-sister don't you think? *forces you to nod* Ahh... better... Hehe, why is it that girls always slapmin movies and stuff? Come on girls thwak it to em! We seriously should start up punching instead of slapping, much more effective don't you think? Ok, so no I haven't taken my medication!
