I can't believe that you are in a pool league. That is so cool. I know you can win because we kept that table all night in HoHo's. Ball in hand is hard to deal with because you do feel like you are cheating but you can put it where you would in bar pool if it makes you feel better. Anyways, I hate statistics and I think I would die if it was my major. Have a great week!
