I was impressed with the interview he gave yesterday on NPR and I really like the  urlLink speech .  I'll be waiting in the next few years for the other shoe to drop. Some scandal, some stupid position I dislike, or perhaps he'll just fall out of favor. My brother may well be right that I'm outside of the mainstream. Certainly, no candidate that I like ever ends up amounting to much. Just ask  urlLink Howard Dean . I'm glad that Dean went the classy route and is supporting Kerry. I have some hope that Dean has helped to change the dynamics of discussion in the Democratic party.  I'm afraid of Republicans.   Looks like I'm not alone.A  urlLink Google  search for "afraid of republicans" came up with 104 results. "afraid of democrats" came up with 41.
