Conceptually it has a kind of dada quality that's amusing.    But, reading the actual story, I began to think about othernews stories I've read in the last month: stories about a urlLink missing woman ;  urlLink a woman and children set on fire ;  urlLink the recent capture of a man accused of killing two former girlfriends ; and a  urlLink man who shot his ex-wife and two kids  . Is it just the time of year when ongoing domestic violence becomes fatal?
