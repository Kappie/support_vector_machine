THE LADIES. these girls, newman, kristin, and kentesheia, may quite possibly be the greatest friends i have ever had. we never have drama. well, with eachother. we never fight. we never get jealous, and we're always supportive.  people have a stereotype of PRETTY GIRLS like us, and damn it, we're amazing.  i just need to be cheered up. i need to act stupid in public. i need to talk to strangers. i need to LAUGH MY ASS OFF WITH MY LADIES!  AND DAMN IT, I WILL! :)
