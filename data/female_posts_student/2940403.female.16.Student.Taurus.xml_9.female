Belongings strewn around, across tables, on chairs, thrown carelessly on the floor... like my life it seems. Stepped on. Walked on. Everyhing representing someone else. So many empty chairs. So many empty people. What represents me? Who the hell are they to judge me?  Then... who am I to judge them? What's my 'scene'? I don't have one. What's my stereotype? I'm not one. Who the fuck am I?  I don't dress one way... not goth, not punk, nor prep nor geek. I'm a blend... but never happy with any... never comfortable.  I don't have a best friend. So if I can't find one, I'll make one. My journal will have to do... and possibly you'll become a friend though it, indirectly.  Emptiness, lonliness, destruction, hatred, jealousy, bitterness. I just want to break down. I'm too afraid someone I know will see.  I find anger and hate and ugliness in everything. The only things that give me pleasure are drawing, which I'm not even good at. I waste my life on the computer... which my parents don't approve of. How surprising.  Writing gets old. My arm hurts. I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up. Joy in nothing.  "Talking to yourself again. Suicidal imbecile. Think about it, put it on the faultline. What'll it take to get it through to you precious over this. Why do you wanna throw it away like this. Such a mess. I dont wanna watch you"  I know that disconnecting myself from everyone isn't helping. I'm just sick of not belonging... never feel right with anyone. So I sit and read Time and Newsweek and science books by myself, saying hello to passerby every once in awhile... thinking what it might be like to be their best friend... a good friend. I wish I had one... Slit my wrists and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye.
