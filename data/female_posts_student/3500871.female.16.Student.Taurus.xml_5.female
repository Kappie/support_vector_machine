Probably because I haven't spoken to Kyle for a few days and he came on MSN today and it overjoyed me to find that he hadn't been avoiding me, he was just grounded. But anyways. It was my sister's graduation today and my dad picked me up to go and he let me drive and everything. My God, did she ever look gorgeous. Honestly. She shone. But enough about that (and if she finds out I said that, I'll kill you all). On the way home, my dad was driving and Meatloaf's Bat out of Hell came on the radio so needless to say, we both burst into a huge musical number for the rest of the way home (it's a long song, give me a break). Times like these make me realize how I can't possibly hate my father despite what he's done. Wow, this is mushy. I'm leaving.
