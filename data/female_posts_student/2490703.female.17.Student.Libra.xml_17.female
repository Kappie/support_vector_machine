It's so retarded. I was picking up Tyler from school today, and I saw some people that I know, but I'm not tight with. One of them came over and started talking to me. We talk because of band and we had 2 other classes together this year, but before this year I had never talked to him in my entire life. It's wierd how when things are starting to change, people come together. I always thought things like that were wierd. Like after 9-11 people started having American flags up and they supported the president and all this crap. Then the war starts and the people of America are like screw Bush blah. I just don't get it. People are just wierd. But anyway, I have to jet, I have adresses to type up and thank you letters to write. Hope to see you soon!   Peace and Love,  Melissa
