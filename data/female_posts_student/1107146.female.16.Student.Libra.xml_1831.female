We'll be great. And capitalizing on our...or at least, my, best personality traits. Tho I've never seen Will act gay, tho I think he could do a really good job of it if he tried. If that tells you all anything about the nature of this brilliant, yet slightly culturually biased, plan.  Irrelevently.
