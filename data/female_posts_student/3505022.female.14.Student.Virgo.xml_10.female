Well I know I've talked about 2 different guyz on here and how much I've like them but I've been over them for such a long time. And yes sadly I like someone else.... But this time he's an ex-boyfriend. How sad! What's worse is that we've broken up and gotten back togeth so many times that I'm afriad of people might say IF we got back together. But I doubt that we well, I've told him that I still feel for him but he hasn't responded. And I know he's gotten it because he's like a computer freak (but a good freak!). Well before I bore you all into dream land. Goodnight!
