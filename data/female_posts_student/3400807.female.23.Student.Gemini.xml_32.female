Weirdness... I'm working on writing the post about Joseph that I  urlLink promised , and in remembering everything, I have the strongest urge to go get a cigarrette. I mean, I can taste it in my mouth, exactly the way it felt, tasted, smelled when I was smoking... Funny thing, that... it seems like it's part of the memory. Like having a cigarette in my hand, taking a drag, is all part of remembering him.
