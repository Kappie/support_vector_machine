Uhhh... he got married once then got divorced. He got married again and got divorced. He got Married again and got divorced. He's on his 4th marriage now. I love my dad. He's fucking #1 and he's fucking loaded. I hate his wife. She's a bitch. If my dad took his dad's last name my name wouldn't be Sunshine Jenkins.. it'd have been Sunshine Hastique.Uhh.... My dad joined the Army when he was 17 years old. He retired as a Sergeant Major aka 1st Seregeant last year after 23 years i think. He has 3 kids. Uhhh.. yeah.. that's my dad.  ***********************************************  I didn't post yeseterday cuz i didn't want to turn my cookies on. MY ASH WHORE CALLED!! I MISSED HIM SOOOOO MUCH. He said he went to see his mother's family in Arizona and couldn't call. He'll be home on Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. I can't wait. I miss him soooooooooo fucking much. We're supposed to have a porn party (gay porn only) when he gets home. I'm soooo happy. I was sooo happy when he called i didn't even bitch him out. Tomorrow i have to go to my dad's house and do stuff. On saturday my mom wants me to go see my grandmother again but fuck i don't want to. Urrr... my hair is no longer a big friz ball.. took me like 2 hours to get it straight again. My mom thinks im Anorexic now so i've got to gain some weight (which will be no problem). Still haven't gotten my schedule, but i finally got started on AP assignments.. other news later.
