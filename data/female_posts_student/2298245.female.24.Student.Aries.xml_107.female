So here are all my thoughts on any category that means anything to me.  Special thanks to my ex-roomie and goodest (yes, I know it's not a word) friend, a.k.a. the bonnie lass from Jersey ( New  Jersey, that is) for her help in gathering my thoughts on these auspicious awards:   Best Actor :  To me, this category includes the biggest surprise of the nominations, and that is the inclusion of Johnny Depp among the ranks.  Not that he's not a wonderful actor, or he wasn't good in the movie - I myself haven't seen it, so I will refrain from commenting - but  Pirates of the Caribbean  is not the type of movie that usually gets Oscar recognition.  That said, there are always surprises, and I guess this year is no different.  I'd really like to see Sean Penn win for  Mystic River .  I think it'll be him or Bill Murray for  Lost in Translation .  Right now, I'll give Penn the edge, but sometimes controversy is something the Academy likes to avoid, so they may go with Murray in the end.   Best Supporting Actor :  Yay for Alec Baldwin.  He was great in  The Cooler , and I'd like to see him win.  But it's not going to be him.  Probably, it will go to Tim Robbins from  Mystic River .  And as he's a good actor who often goes unrecognized, I wouldn't have any problem with that at all.  The rest of these performances have gone unseen by me, so I can't comment on their desert of the nomination or the award.  Del Toro's won already (nominated here for  21 Grams ), so I'd say he won't win again, though.     Best Actress :  I've only seen one of the movies, and Diane Keaton was very good in  Something's Gotta Give , so I can't make much of a statement of who should win the award.  What's surprising is who is missing from the list.  No Nicole Kidman from  Cold Mountain , even though her co-stars Jude Law and Renee Zellweger received nods.  Also no Scarlet Johansson, who was, in my opinion, even better than Bill Murray in  Lost in Translation .  But look for Charlize Theron in  Monster  to take the award, as this is the performance of the year, if you listen to all the buzz and hype.  I haven't seen the movie, but it strikes me as one of those roles that actresses would kill for, meaty and full of Oscar potential.   Best Supporting Actress :  This award will probably go to Renee Zellweger, though I suppose, if it doesn't, it could just as well go to anyone.  It's nice to see Patricia Clarkson here.  I didn't see  Pieces of April , but she is a great actress and she deserves recognition.   Best Animated Feature :  Definitely going to go to  Finding Nemo , even though I've heard good things about both the other films, especially  The Triplets of Belleville .   Best Director :  Best thing about this category - Anthony Minghella was not nominated to  Cold Mountain .    Also, it happens every year, and this year, the odd man out is Gary Ross, who was not nominated for  Seabiscut , even though is movie received a Best Picture nod.  The Academy opted instead for  City of God  director Fernando Meirelles, backed by the Miramax machine.  As an aside, I think that Harvey Weinstein might be the anti-Christ.  At the very least, he is the Boss Tweed of his generation and of the film industry.  I'm hoping Peter Jackson wins here.    The Lord of the Rings  trilogy is an amazing achievement, as even non-fans must acknowledge, and he deserves recognition for it.     Best Picture :  Again, I have to side with  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King .  Though I do have a soft spot in my heart for  Mystic River , if for no other reason than all the Boston accents were actually really good.  As an aside, for an example of a bad Boston accent, watch the first ten minutes of Kevin Costner in  Thirteen Days .   Best Screenplay - Adapted :  I must say I find the nominations here a little weak.  Perhaps it was just a bad year for writing.  As much as I liked  Mystic River , I'm not sure I'd credit the screenplay for that as much as I would the acting and the photography.  I'd have to pick  American Splendor  here, which was easily one of the most original movies of the year.  And it also had one of my very favorite film moments of the year, in which Hope Davis' character, who has a habit of diagnosing the personality disorders of everyone she comes in contact with, dubs David Letterman a "megalomaniac."   Best Screenplay - Original :  The pickings are better here, though I haven't seen very many of them.  I'd have to side with  Lost in Translation , which bore one of my other favorite film moments of the year, namely that Japanese guy doing a karaoke version of the Sex Pistols' "God Save the Queen."  I still haven't stopped laughing at this...  So those are my thoughts...whatever they're worth.  It'll be fun to watch the Oscars on Feburary 29 to see who wins.  My thoughts might change if I see more movies between now and then.  And look for my post-Oscar night rant.  There's always something that upsets me, and I'm sure this year will be no exception.
