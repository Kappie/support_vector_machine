This year though, the storms have seemed to be harsher than usual. People in the town were beginning to worry; yet, the mayor reminds them that they are just storms they should have nothing to worry about. On this night, the storm seems to be the worst than it had been all week. The waves were higher, the winds were stronger, and the moral of the town was fraying. The dangerous waters were sloshing back and forth on the decimated beach side. As the water would back off into the sea, you would be able to see dieing fish lying on the beach. Then the waves would come back in and wash the filth away. As a vicious cycle, the water then leaves filth again. The filth would momentarily go away, but, you could count on its return. Looking up from the beach are several beach houses. Paint worn and shutters flapping, the storm was giving these houses a run for their money. As the large gusts of wind blew in, the shutters would quickly smash into the sides of the houses. The wind would stop and suck back out to sea like a warrior taking in a breath before lunging forward again. Inside the pale green beach house, two women are sitting at a table, lit by only a single candle at the center of the table. The older of the two women is Mrs. Emily Thompson, a 62 year old woman, who’s out look on any situation, is that of utter disgust. While the young woman of 22, Ms. Isabel Katertil, had a lighter look on the world, in which everything had some kind of purpose. “You know Isabel, these storms have been getting worse ever since July” said Mrs. Thompson as she sipped on the freshly brewed tea that was made to calm their nerves. “We all agree that Mrs. Thompson, but, they will get better. You just watch” Isabel replied. “The mayor is just saying that… You haven’t heard what is really happening around here do you?” said Mrs. Thompson, she leaned closer to Isabel, as if someone else was there to here her. “Oh, come on now Emily. You have too much intelligence to be believing in those silly stories. With all those years under your belt, you’d think you would have more sense then that” chuckled Isabel as she poured Mrs. Thompson more tea. 	“You’re too young to understand Isabel, when I was your age I didn’t believe in no stories like these either. I smartened up, and so should you” replied Mrs. Thompson as she leaned back in the chair and drank some of her tea. 	As she sat in the dark, the lights flickered once and then remained dead as if they used up their last breath of air. Mrs. Thompson looked up at the lights in hopes that they would suddenly jump back to life. Isabel looked out the windows and starred at the beach. 	“You’re right about one thing Mrs. Thompson, these storms are getting worse” Isabel said those words and had a look of sorrow on her face, she then looked at Mrs. Thompson for a second then broke eye contact and glanced around the room. 	“I know you’re worried about your boyfriend, Mark, and you probably don’t want to here what I think. Everyone is always telling me I say the wrong things at the wrong time” said Mrs. Thompson as she got up and slowly walked to the door. 	At this time the two women both starred out the window to see that there was a figure on the beach. Out far enough to get hit by debris but close enough to not get dragged out. The figure was of something they had never seen before, it gleamed as a crack of lighting hit the water, and it was just standing still. 	“Now, what does that person think their doing?” Isabel said to herself as she looked out at the figure. 	“I never seen them around before, and why are they standing out in the water like that?” Mrs. Thompson said as she started to open the window. 	“Why are you opening the window?” Isabel seemed scared but, she tried to hide it. 	“Well, I am going to find out what the hell they are doing out there” Mrs. Thompson said as she looked up at Isabel. 	Mrs. Thompson open the window and grabbed onto the scarf that she was wearing, the wind was so bad, that if she didn’t it would have blown away. As she was about to yell something, the figure began to move. Slowly, but, just enough to notice, it was slowly walking up towards the houses. Mrs. Thompson squinted to be able to see it but with her age she couldn’t see much. 	“Isabel, where did they go?” Mrs. Thompson whispered as if someone might over hear. 	“They’re still there, but, they have stopped walking” Isabel said as she was holding her hand over her face so the rain would not hit it. 	“Hey! Hey you out there! You best be getting off that beach, your going to get hurt or worse!” Mrs. Thompson yelled out as she cupped her hands around her mouth. 	Isabel kept her eyes on the figure, the thing gave her the feeling that if she looked away, it would disappear. At that moment the figured turned and ran down the beach, away from Isabel’s beach house. Then it stopped, turned, and looked straight at Isabel. She knew it too, that chilled her to the very bone. A bolt of lighting struck somewhere off in the distances but was enough to light up the figure for someone with good eyes to see. 	“Did you see him Isabel?” asked Mrs. Thompson 	Isabel said nothing; she stood there leaning against the window sill. Looking back at the figure, as if it suddenly intrigued her so much that everything else in her mind had been shut out. 	“Isabel” said Mrs. Thompson as she took Isabel’s hand in hers and began to shake it. 	There was still no answer, and Mrs. Thompson began to get worried. She started shaking Isabel violently, as if to shake someone into consciousness. Yet nothing she did worked. Isabel just stood there immobile starring out the window. 	“Isabel! What is going on? All you alright? Do you need a doctor?” Mrs. Thompson’s questions rang out with no answer. 	Then Mrs. Thompson turned to look out the window, to see what was so interesting, only to see that her view was blocked, by the figure standing only a foot outside the window. Starring back at her, she let out a scream that was silenced by a roll of thunder.
