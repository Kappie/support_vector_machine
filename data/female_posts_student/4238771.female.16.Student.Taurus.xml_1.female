There are the Chinese, Filipinos, Americans, Japanese and people who claims that they have multiple races!!!! Whoa! Talk about United Nation!!! Its almost as if school is just one planet, right? And in school, we also have a world leader, George Bush a.k.a. "The Principal"!!! And we also have this wide ocean that acts like a wall. It separtes different kinds of people. The popular kids, the geeks, the losers and everybody else. So you see, School is really a big, big place even though it anly takes like about 1-2 hectare of land! And sometimes, you can feel the dizziness as it spins. It goes too fast then too slow for you to know exactly what you're doing. Even though, differences are among the students, some tried to get along with the "oh so mighty" ones and some, vice versa. Each group of people has their own culture. But in every planet, there are some countries who try to colonize smaller ones! Bullies! But even though these smaller countries are very tmid or not outspoken, you'll never know what they can do!
