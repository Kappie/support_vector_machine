So anyway, she's saying that i've never done anything for her (wich is a complete and utter lie, because i have been her slave all my life.) and that if i'm gonna be decent i should stay home with the kids while she goes out because she never gets to go to costco, nooo. i don't want to watch the bloody kids. plus, costco is the coolest and i must buy the shakira CD (its a long story) and i have to buy a romance novel for mary, the oldest sister of mine in Northwestern. ughhh... anyway, i don't know why i should be all high and mighty to margaret when she has been such a jerk to me for so long. gotta go, i hear her calling...
