Most of my friends are the persons you would look at and problably say "whathehell?" but I  love  them like that cause I am crazy with them .. So thats pretty much about  friends. I am not going to give you my name but i'll tell you what i like: i like any kind of music cept country and gospel, i love cartoons, and frappuchinos-STARBUCKS- i am a girl who likes to keep things bottled up till i explode. Well I love music and my friends, i like beign poetic and if no one likes that about me what can I say well: nice to know ya laters!: well thats it lol                                            Chaoticgirl
