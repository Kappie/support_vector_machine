I am looking forward to it and hope that she is as excited as I am about the whole thing, although I don’t expect her to be because she doesn’t know what we are going to do yet (she thinks she is coming over tonight for a Pajama party). I also hope that Jesse will be online tonight because I want to show him how big Elizabeth has gotten. I am thinking maybe there will be a photo booth at the Zoo and we can have two pictures made that way I have one and she can have on of her with her Auntie.                These last few weeks have been really slow at work and for that I am semi grateful because it has given me some time to do some things at work that I haven’t had the time to do, like catch up on some reading and talk to some friends I haven’t been able to talk to in a long time. I have also had a little more time to talk to Jesse while he is on shift.               I start school in two weeks and I am so not ready to go back but at the same time I can’t wait to get the creative juices flowing in my head again. I know that going back to school will help me pass my time although I am not to sure what I am going to do about the work situation but I have figured I will take that in stride and see where life takes me.               I have talked to Jesse off and on the last few days and he seems ok, I know it did him a world of good getting a timeframe for his R and I know that probably did wonders to boost his moral. I can’t wait till he gets to come home because I miss him so much. I have decided that I want to stay at this new Marriott hotel on the River for the first few days he is home. I know everything is going to be wonderful when he comes home and even thinking about this now makes me smile from ear to ear.                There are a lot of things you tend to miss when you aren’t constantly around the person you love. It is funny; sometimes I even miss the annoying things Jesse would do. Right now I could safely say I would give anything just to have him home for good.               Anything!
