The I met their daughter and found out her name was Cayenne.  At Music Midtown, I kept seeing this couple walking around. The woman was very short and dressed modestly, in a T-shirt and long shorts, but had a shaved peach-fuzzy head. Her boyfriend/husband was very tall (Tim and shaved Allie, anyone?) and wore no shirt, but had a green camo cowboy hat on. As they walked, he was absentmindedly rubbing her bald head.  And this is the best...... Lit/Lang students, chew on this.  A week or so ago, I was on my break at work and was sitting outside the cookie place doing HW. Two little girls walked by, and they were about 8/9/10 years old. One was wearing a hot-pink spaghetti-strap top and a more modest little girls' version of those fluttery skirts you see these days, made of denim, and heeled sandals. Her friend wore a big blue t-shirt and big shorts and flip-flops.     As they passed KB Toys, which closed recently, the one in blue stopped and peered into the window. Her friend, annoyed, called her to come on.
