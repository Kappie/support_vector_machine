So, today Zach and i got to giggling like crazy. The father figure was upset with us. He was really clingy though and we were cracking up about capitol barbie. The truth of the matter is. That i see so much of her in me. Or me in her. Something  like that. I just see so much becuase you know what? the truth is that if i were in her position i would act like her. I talked to her with bryant today. Shes okay, tells the truth. She got three percent higher than i did on the test. Its okay, i wont kill her for it. I still love her like crazy. lol. Well anyways, i really should be going, working on homework. Schools almost out so that means new layout! Isnst that nifty? Anyways...new layout most probably. But without paintbrushes...im ultimetly nothing! (Spelling) Love you mucha!
