I don't know if I've told any of you, but I'm going to Las Vegas for the first time in August.  My cousin is getting married there.  I know, I know, but if you knew her, you'd understand.  *smile*  That trip is going to be a definite highlight.  I just hope I don't get sick on the plane.  Bring gum...lots of gum.  I found a great lyric that really made me happy.  That second line struck me something fierce, for it sums up how I feel about my writing most days.   This whole world needs an anthem And I'm trying to put the words where they belong Yeah, this whole world needs an anthem And I'm hoping everyone will sing along.
