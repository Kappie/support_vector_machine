But there's also an incredible urge to do some hard-core legal research and analysis on the Appellate Brief bear.  The cramps suck, but the emotional clarity, zen-like high they ushered in make them easier to cope with.    Think the months of morning pages are finally doing what they promised to do in May.  Clearing out years of pent-up thoughts/feelings/issues/etc., making way for new thoughts/feelings/issues, etc. in order to facilitate the creative process.    I once promised Lorraine I would write our story for the world to read; it was the kind of conversation that followed long, lazy hours in the secret apartment (aka The Nest), and the promise made with an 18 year-old's seriousness and sincerity.  It was hard-core.  But today, all I can think of is how much I want to write about the camping trip on Scout Mountain the August before senior year; the nights at the Nest; learning how to shift new-to-me Harley's gears.    Not sure now is the time of the great Telling; but it is time to start getting these stories/memories on paper.
