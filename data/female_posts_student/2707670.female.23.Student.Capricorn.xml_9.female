By 8 we were all feeling "so good" and decided that we should probably eat something. So a group of us headed to BW3's and had a good old time. I ended up staying at my office mate, Whitney's house. We got up Saturday morning and had to return the car we had borrowed the night before and then had a delectible lunch served by a hottie named Bo who made our day because something about that dark brown hair and blue eyes didn't bother us at all. So after watching a couple chick flicks I ended up crashing with Whitney again last night and I am sure that my roommate has officially reported me missing or something but I don't care. I am now attempting to do homework which I am not getting done and then I am headed to the ballet with some new friends. I'll let you know how that goes. Now I must work on my math and read a book that is a scientific paper disguised as a novel.  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');
