The meal totalled up to about $59.++ It's not a problem to him cos he's so rich and $60 is nothing to his father..haha..  Wilson and Jerren ate like gluttons, as usual. Hmm..leftover food..wonder what happened to them? Theo and I played with the leftover food..mixing everything together till it smelled horrid..but was real fun. Jerren took a pic of the disgusting creation, Lim can't be bothered..too disgusted. The state of the leftover food is gonna be worse tml. lolx...crappy plans..depends..see where we go first. Basically, leftover food will NEVER be in good state when tampered with CREATIVE people like me..haha
