Yesterday he was feeling very ill and mom and Ale took him to the clinic to find out that his bladder was superfull and he couldn't urinate. He may have kidney stones. Actually, the doctor thought he was set to die. They called yesterday, and I was informed of the whole situation when I got home, at about 11.00 pm. Cried loads, but today I called as soon as I woke up, and the doctor says he's doing a little better. Not by much, but any step further from death is a relief.   Evidently, his bladder was the size of a grapefruit, and he's urinating more blood than urine. He's been on IV's and fluids all night, and they have run some x-rays. He has a [insert word that I cannot think of in English right this very now] in him, and it's going to stay there until his urine starts clearing up a bit.   I really hope he keeps getting better. We're all extremely worried and teary about the whole deal... I don't know what I'll do if Shah dies... I mean, we've had the cat for almost 9 years. His birthday is May 5. He's like a family member, and he's very treasured. I just feel so awful that I've been so busy that I haven't bothered to spend time with him nearly all semester-- particularly not this entire week.   We're going to go see him today before going to Kim's graduation tea; just *whimper*           =-(      "Everything's Not Lost"  by Coldplay    If you ever feel neglected, If you ever think all is lost, I'll be counting up my demons, yeah, Hoping everything's not lost, Everything's not lost, When I'm counting up my demons.  There's always one for everyday, With the good ones on my shoulder, I drove the other ones away.  If you ever feel neglected, If you think all is lost, I'll be counting up my demons, yeah, Hoping everything's not lost.  When you thought it was over, You could feel it all around, Everybody's out to get you, Don't you let it drag you down.  Cos if you eve feel neglected, If you think that all is lost, I'll be counting all the demons, yeah.  Singing out  Everything's not lost Come on yeah, come on yeah Everything's not lost O yeah Everything's not lost
