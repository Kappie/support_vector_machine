I woke up like yesterday and a light bulb flashed in my head. I'm a bit afraid of commitment.      Lets rewind by like 2 nights ago. . .           I couldn't go to sleep so i was online about 1 in the morning. All of a sudden nick logs on and we're talking (i.e- Nick is a friend ive known for aprx 4yrs.)   So everything is well and i dunno, he just started pouring his guts out to me in a very beautiful way. a while back i did ask him out but he said no. so it was like fine whatever, i wasn't going to be angery, instead i continued to befriend him like i had always did. Now, he has feelings for me.. and i don't know what to say.      I'm flatterd, and afraid. i care so much for him, but i'm just afraid of getting my heart broken, i think the reason is because i've grown up around heart break and don't want to have to feel that kind of pain ever. I've been like this seriously for as long as about 2 yrs and it sucks. Lets just say i'm good at running away from my problems.          I don't know what to do. .
