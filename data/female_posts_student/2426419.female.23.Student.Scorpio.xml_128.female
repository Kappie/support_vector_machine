We picked up Jaci and headed to The Well for Writer's Circle which was so much fun. I read a part of my autobiography and Ray wrote a script that we acted out with Jay. I loved hearing everyone's work - I was completely impressed with it all. Jaci's piece on New York was so specific and nostalgic, Quentin had this amazing inner monologue description of New Mexico, and Jay with his very professional-sounding story on his grandfather, then Johnny with his scenic walk through the woods.   Afterward, we drove back to my place to watch the OC, fool around with my video camera, and eat pizza.   Good night all.
