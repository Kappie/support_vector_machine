You know, a lot of my un-peered friends are attached. Oops, explanation of un-peered friends: friends who are not my peers. These friends of mine seem to have found their love (Ah, that sweet word) and they are pretty sure their attachment will be their future spouse. I am particularly close to one, who has been in a relationship for a year. She tells me a lot about her relationship, the bliss, the sadness, the loud absence when her lover isn’t around, the challenges, the difficulties and most of all, the love.   How does it feel to be in love, I wonder. I find a lot of people have a contaminated idea of love. That it is just a feeling, a sensation (ie. The Darkness’ song Love is Only a Feeling) that will eventually fade away. Or it is the pleasure of making love (ie. Sex is referred as making love) Bah! What shallow expressions of love. I mean, of course, love can mean those things. But it does include a hundred billion other things as well, that I am sure. What those hundred billion other things are, I cannot tell. I have experienced my parents love, my brother’s love, my friends’ love and most ultimately God’s love.  I have yet to experience the love of my boyfriend, my husband. In fact, I may never get to experience it. (Just um, reminding myself that it is possible, though with all my heart I want a husband! Hah.) Yes, I said it: with all my heart I want a husband, in the future of course. Now I’m thinking what if God replies: You should be satisfied with the love you are experiencing because I am Love and My love is the ultimate Love. OOoooooh.. *Mary-Ruth gets wide-eyed*  But, but… I’m holding on that God will grant me my desire (its not unhealthy at all, kay..) one day.  Hmm now I’m afraid to say that what if God thinks it best for me to remain single. You know, I’ve heard people pray like this:  “God, please heal so and so. But if its not Your will, we will kindly accept Your decision.”  So, am I supposed to pray like this as well?  “God, please grant me a husband, but if its not Your will for me to get married, I will be fine with it.”  Awww man.. Sigh. I always joke with my parents that I won’t get married and I’ll just spend my life as a missionary in an African jungle being a missionary and researching snakes. But of course I don’t want to do that!!! YEEEEE so lonely.  Am I too young to be thinking about all this?  I ask too many questions
