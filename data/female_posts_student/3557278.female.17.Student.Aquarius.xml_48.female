My driving lesson was pretty good yesterday actually, lol rafael said "u drive the car like ur bloody own the thing" lol i think thats his form of a compliment?  LOL I'm watching video hits and this fully sik dude just said "I aint 50 cent i'm a chinaman!! I don't speak english, i speak chinese". ok i'm turning it off now...  HMMM anyway! Today i AM going to do some of my Biology Assessment, finish my Better Health summary (almost done ;)) and then do some PIP stuff. Go me :)  OK lol, i keep thinking about tongue piercings! Damn, lol. My mum keeps joking about it, i bought some thumb tacks yesterday to pin up my assessment notification sheets and she was like "Elle, are u going to pierce ur tongue with those" hehe she's funny.  Well i should go and get around to that biology stuff. I really don't feel like it :( AND we have heaps of yearbook stuff to do.   Ok I'm off, ciao.  listening to: Let's get retarded - Black Eyed Peas
