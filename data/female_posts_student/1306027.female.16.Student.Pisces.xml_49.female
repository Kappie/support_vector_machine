Moving On  My brother's team won their basketball yesterday! It was a thourghly gut-wrenching game. If the game had been any more competitive than it was, there would have been blood all over the floor! Those little dudes worked their heart out on that game, and you could tell too cause the score ended up being on 27-24. I almost flew straight out of my seat when my brother almost made a 3 pointer from the outside-right. The basketball flew in- hit the back of the rim- spun around-and flew back out. It was a truly inspired shot since the guy guarding him was like 3 inches taller than he was. I love watching the basketball games, it's great to get out there and cheer for little dudes (by little I mean 11.. which is not really little, but some of them are kinda short). Although, I did secretly wish that we were playing the team we practice with so I could see the hot german guy.....   About the writing class  The class was awesome. I am learning alot about creative writing. The only problem though is that there isn't enough teenagers in there. I mean- 2 ppl my age?? The rest of them were at least 25 or way older. This one lady even asked me how old I was. When I told her I was 16 she says, "How cute!" How cute?! Argh. I don't even have any writing talent I don't see why she should think that it was cute. Anyways- the author was really awesome and he gave a lot of good information. I think I will start writing stuff more often.   After the writing class I went shopping  My mom, brother and I all jumped into the car and headed for the local mall. We looked around in a few odd stores. My brother was trying to find a gift for a friend, and I was trying to blow my money. "Hey lets go into the christmas store," said my mom. I spotted something straight away, it was a horse figure with a Van Gogh painting on it. I am crazy about Van gogh and I love horses too so I stepped away to ponder if I would buy it. Three minutes later I turned around and it was gone! The lady who had been watching my mother and I look at the horse was buying it at the counter. ARGH- I hate malls for that very reason. I was disheartened so we went to  urlLink Build-A-Bear  were you can make these awesomely cute teddy bears. I'm nuts about teddy bears. I made the valentine bear, got him some valentines boxers, and called him Mr. FluffNStuff. My brother bought the horse thing and decorated him with the birtday kit. It was soooo cute! I'm sure his friend is gonna love it.    Once we left the mall I went to walmart  I kinda got sick while I was there so I left after a few minutes. I stayed in bed the rest of the night. How fun huh? Ahh well I got Mr. FluffNStuff from the day so it wasn't all bad.    Erg Da Jerg (slur for Erk the Jerk)
