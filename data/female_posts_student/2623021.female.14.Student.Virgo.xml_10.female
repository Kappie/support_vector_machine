It is sad in a way, but also reasuring. At least time is moving. I would be nice if I could turn time back and change it, but I can't. I'd keep it as Kindergarten forever. :) I loved that year, maybe 4th and 5th grade. Great years. Don't get me wrong I like high school, but I wouldn't want to be stuck here forever. Maybe if I could go back to Football season. That would be the best thing ever. If I had a choice I wouldn't have missed a single game, home or away. I went to the game that was 8 hours away. Some interesting things went down on that trip... let's see. The ride up was hella fun, and the ride back was great. When we were actually AT the game Felicia and I just stayed in the bathroom trying to get warm. Actually... on the way back I sat in the isle IN an ice chest and leaning against the bathroom door. So all the people on the bus couldn't go to the bathroom without waking me up... well it's 1:30 and I'm dead tired. Ciao
