I wonder if it's  real  fruit I'm eating (probably not, cuz i never like to eat anything healthy). The ingredients are  Juice from concentrates  corn syrup sugar modified corn starch citric acid carnauba wax (...that sounds weird) alpha tocopehrol (what the hell) and some other things I can't pronouce, let alone take the time to type out. There is also a phone number on the back to call for any "Comments or Questions". Do people actually call? What would they possibly have to say that's half interesting. "HI, This is Darci from ohio, i just love the fruit snacks!" yeah, that sounds great. I would call in and say "Hey what the hell is up with these fucking fruit snacks, they give my dad gas and my mom grew a sixth toe on her left foot that resembles a small grape! By the way your  "berries 'n cherries" flavored snacks are delicious!" Okay, i would never do that, but someone should. I bet those poor people working the phones are dying of boredom. I would have strangled my self with a phone cord by now.............. Anyway, i finally got out of my house, well I made it to mailbox that is. I was planning on taking a walk around my neighborhood for so much needed air, but then i realized I would be  walking , and I'm to damn lazy for such an extreme thing like that. But i think my little trip from the front door to the mailbox is a major improvement (i usually never make it pass the driveway). Thank god for high metabolism. Anyway, I didn't feel like going back inside, so i circled my house a few times. It was a very educational experience. I learned that I actually had a backyard! and it has grass and flowers, just like the front yard (yeah, i know, i'm still taking it all in). wow, it's amazing the things you learn when you go outside. Who knows what else is out there, i could have sprinkler system for all i know (god forbid). j/k.  I think I need some more fruit snacks, it's been about 5 minutes, and I'm already having withdrawal symptoms chow 4 now
