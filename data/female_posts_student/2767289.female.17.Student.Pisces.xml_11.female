I might as well get a B in all my classes... bummer. *** So talking to Eric was really the highlight of my Saturday.  He's really a cool guy.  I still wonder how old he is... hmmm.....   I got the vibe from him that they are kinda sick of the Grobanites.  Well...not really   sick   of them... just that it's getting out of hand.  And when I told him that I found out about the BL's through the Josh Groban forum... he was like... "oh...josh groban..."  It seems like the only fans they are getting are grobanites.  I think, just once, they wanna hear someone say... "I read an article about you in the magazine and you guys rock!"  But instead they are getting like 50-60 year olds stalking them.  LoL. I don't think I really fit in with the Grobanites.  Yeah, I'm a HUGE fan of Josh and I adore him for his voice and maybe his beautiful looks and personality... but it's not like I travel to every concert venue he's at and do all the crazy things they do.  And like Eric said... Im not 60! LoL.   Anywho, I am kind of inspired (more) to learn the guitar... and I mean LEARN THE GUITAR.  Not just the chords, or the picking patterns, but EVERYTHING!!!  So I'm thinking of taking Guitar1 at PCC maybe in the fall term... I still have to check if they'll be offering it...   as for my happy list: 1)Seeing Randy and Eric again 2)Chatting with Eric 3)Playing ping-pong with Joel
