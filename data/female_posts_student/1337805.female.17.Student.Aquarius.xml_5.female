There are 4 boys and one girl downstairs, a boy and the girl being a couple. They scare me. I mean, I went to CUC with some of them, and I was with them last night, but downstairs, without Misha is scary. I'm so shy. It was big nerves of me to go out and bloop with them with out her last night. I'm shit. And my stuff is downstairs too.  It's not even like they are even doing anything interesting! They are only playing stupid video/computer games.  Golly, I need more sleep....
