The song is running throughmy head so much that sometimes, when I'm not conscious of it, I begin to sing it out loud. Trust me, I have a terrible singing voice and you would NEVER EVER want to hear me sing. I have no idea on why I'm in Chorus or why my teacher told me that I was a fantastic singer when I amapositively horrible singer. I can not sing the song all that well either. Please, believe me, I'm really, REALLY bad at singing... Anyways, you've probably heard of it before. It's called My Happy Ending by Avril Lavigne. If you're like everyone else in New York, then you know this song and absolutely love it. It's a hit on 95 Triple X, my hometown station... It's in the Top 40. I don't like it just because of that. In fact, I don't like a lot of the songs in the Top 40... Yet, anyways, I like it because I can relate to it. Though it sounds weird, it feels like she knew about my situation with my EBGF and wrote that song about it. I know that it's impossible but to me it does...   Anyhow, here's the lyrics and why Ithink that it totally makes me think of the situation between my EBGF and I.    My Happy Ending By Avril Lavigne        oh oh, oh oh,    So much for my happy ending,oh oh, oh oh,    So much for my happy ending,    Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh    Let's talk this over    It's not like we're dead    Was it something I did?    Was it something You said?    Don't leave me hanging    In a city so dead    Held up so high    On such a breakable thread    You were all the things I thought I knew    And I thought we could be        CHORUS: You were everything, everything that I wanted    We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it    All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away    All this time you were pretending    So much for my happy ending    oh oh, oh oh, so much for my happy ending        Oh oh, oh oh    You've got your dumb friends    I know what they say(they say)    They tell you I'm difficult    But so are they(so are they)    But they don't know me    Do they even know you?(even know you)    All the things you hide from me    All the shit that you do(all the shit that you do)    You were all the things I thought I knew    And I thought we could be        [CHORUS]        It's nice to know that you were there    Thanks for acting like you cared    And making me feel like I was the only one    It's nice to know we had it all    Thanks for watching as I fall    And letting me know we were done     He was everything, everything that I wanted    We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it    All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away    All this time you were pretending    So much for my happy ending        You were everything, everything that I wanted    We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it    All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away    All this time you were pretending    So much for my happy ending    oh oh, oh oh, so much for my happy ending    Oh oh, oh oh, so much for my happy ending    oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh ohoh oh,...    Okay, now I'll explain to you on WHY I think that this wonderful song relates to the situation my EBGF and I are in. See, my EBGF and I aren't friends anymore just like Avril and this guy aren't talking anymore or whatever. I also live in a pretty boring city that Avril sort of mentioned in the first verse.   The chorus describes what I'm feeling very well. I felt that since we were such great friends that we were meant to be together. Yet, it turns out that he doesn't seem to care about me anymore, which makes me wonder if he had been pretending to like me all along. So, this makes me upset and all like  so much for my happy ending.    The 2nd verse illustrates the situation we're in quite nicely too. My EBGF's friends call me mean things like dyke, bitch, etc... They say that I'm difficult too. He also did things and hid them away from me or whatever...  Basically, that wraps everything up. I just felt like that my EBGF and I were meant to be together. I mean, we used to be the best of friends and then everything went wrong and all... It's just like the song, sort of.  Maybe it's not exactly like the song but hey, it's pretty close, right? Don't agree with me? Ah, I don't care... I think that it does and that's all that matters to me right now... Okay, what the hell did I just type to you? Oh, well, nevermind...  And I'm out.
