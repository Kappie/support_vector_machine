I really hate to use tt term but there at times when it fits purrfectly fine to the situation... I'm starting to consciously detach myself from emotions and to look at matters in a more rational and practical perspective... I'm here to do my Honours, to study.. I've got major problems in finishing my wrk and I shld never hav let this happen.. but I did and now I bear some responsibilities... I don't wanna shake them off as I'm old enuff to think tt such is life and I hav to handle sticky situations when it comes my way...Nothin is fair in this world if it really is... I won't hav a not so perfect family.. hard to relate sibling.. stepping unto ppl's toes unknowingly.. and perhaps even snatching someone's bf away... Life is unfair so what can you do abt it...  I love to think tt I'm enjoying this but seems like not.. coz I've got a conscious bugging me.. Oblivion is not easily attain unless you are dead to the people you love.. I just wanna be away from this world for a moment.. but I know my baby will feel the pain so I'll btl my own pain to see him happy... he calls this self-sacrificing.. but I don't wanna add hurt into his life.. I love him and yes despite my mind wantin to shut off and be still.. I will open a tiny window for him... juz for him
