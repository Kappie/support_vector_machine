She stopped taking her anti-depressants a month ago; they cost too much. She had a breakdown today. Called the doctor crying. Had to leave work to go to the doctor. She said that the only thing that has kept her alive this week (literally) is me. She said that she would have killed herself this week if she would have known that I had someone in life. She realizes that I don't. And I really mean   someone  . Jordan, my brother, has his father (that I can't stand), grandparents, and everyone here. The only person that I have, besides her, is Paul...and frankly, I couldn't go live with him if something happened. I would be sent away to California and that is the reason that she didn't do something drastic. She didn't want me to have to give up my life here. Now I am living in a land of guilt. How can I be so selfish? I vow to take into consideration the way others are feeling and what they may be going through. I ask for help in keeping this vow. So all I have left to say is...sorry.  God Bless.
