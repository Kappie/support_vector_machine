Ordinary Life (Kristen Barry)   "and i shed my soul, feel it kneeling down   i´m clutching my faith, pull it tightly round   you´re moving your mouth, but you don´t make a sound   but i feel the walls slowly tearing down    heel to toe takes you from my side   in and out, every breath divides   my eyes to your head, i can´t go the distance   but when you go you take me in an instant    in this life, i´ll give it time   ´cause it´s always spinning up from behind   it´ll be alright, it will be fine   ´cause it´s nothing more than ordinary life    and i show you my sins, show me all your scars   as we settle in, it´s written in the stars   your watery eyes got me send me floating   and my weak heart is swimming with devotion    in this life, i´ll give it time   ´cause it´s always spinning up from behind   it´ll be alright, it will be fine   ´cause it´s nothing more than ordinary life"
