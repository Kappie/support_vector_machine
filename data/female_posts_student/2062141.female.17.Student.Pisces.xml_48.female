Gotta whip out my X-mas cds this weekend. Oh yeah this weekend! Hopefully Charlotte and Erinn will spend the night, Erinn kinda needs it right now cause she broke up with Cassie. Nick probably will hang out too for a while. Like old times! yay. We can rent 80s movies and eat chocolate. Lol. We are such girls.... cept Nick... who is in fact.... a boy...  ****** Okay time for song lyrics... not that anyone reads them...  Love Song for No One John Mayer  Staying home alone on a Friday Flat on the floor looking back On old love Or lack thereof After all the crushes are faded And all my wishful thinking was wrong I'm jaded I hate it   I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here   Searching all my days just to find you I'm not sure who I'm looking for I'll know it When I see you Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom Staying up all night just to write A love song for no one   I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here   I could have met you in a sandbox I could have passed you on the sidewalk Could I have missed my chance And watched you walk away?   I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here You'll be so good You'll be so good for me
