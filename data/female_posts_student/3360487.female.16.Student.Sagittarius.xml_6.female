For lunch I had a sandwich, two slices of low carb bread (40 cals per piece) with tomatoes, a slice of turkey, a bit of mayo, some lettuce, and a slice of cheese.  I drank a can of vegetable juice for a snack.  Now for dinner I had one shishkabob (sp?), a few spoonfuls of sliced tomatoes, and about 10 sticks of fried asparagus.  Now I really really really want more of the low-carb chocolate I just had a bite of... it tastes so good!!!  Ugh.  I'm going running in a little while so maybe I'll burn some more off.  My dad took some pictures of me outside during dinner and I looked so fat!  I have these nasty chipmunk cheeks that I NEED to get rid of.  In good news, however, I ended up getting an A+ on my history final and an A on my english final.  The A+ brought my A- in that class up to an A so that was really cool.  My SAT II scores weren't so fortunate, however... I got 780 on Biology which is great, but 740 on Writing and 630 ON MATH?  I can definitely do better in Writing and I don't know what happened for me to bomb the math like that.  Current weight: 133.5 High weight:  135.5
