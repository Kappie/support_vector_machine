I just wish I don't drink too much alcohol and wake up lying on a ground and bitten by mosquitos...:P Oh well. And how on earth am I supposed to get myself out of bed at nine o'clock tomorrow? We are leaving at ten, and since it's my summer vacation I'm used to sleeping till 2 PM... I have to set at least three alarms... *sigh* Well, this wasn't very rational, but I guess writing here in English encourages me to use this language more. And at least writing helps me to clear my thoughts a bit. So it doesn't really matter if anyone reads these or not. :P
