Go financial planning! Now that's some fun shit. Well, not really... has to be done though. If I get a job, everything has to be planned in advance, so I don't end up screwed over when the time comes for me to pay for my school... hell, maybe I could go to ACAD if I do this well enough. Now *that* would be super.  *pours a cup of tea and recilnes*  Well, I'm working on the Cinderella story again. Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could publish that? I would be known for writing the most controversial version of the fairy tale  ever.  I would love to be known for that! *huggles Seth and Morgan* And if that ever went well, I'd love to do sleeping beauty... and snow white. And then maybe Alice in Wonderland. I'd have to think of one hell of a twist for that, since that one has been done to death...  *glares at MSN* stupid piece of shit won't log me in for more than 5 minutes! WTF?! *grumbles and pours more tea* eew, that was the grossest jellybean ever. Just thought I'd share that.   Time to work on mah story...
