I went to Taco Bell around like 12:30...and ya. Then I come home at like 1 and my mom was all pissed off at me cuz I went to Taco Bell and cuz I didn't have my phone so I told her I'd go get it from Kevin but she didn't want me to take the car. I was getting a little ticked off cuz ya know I was trying to get the phone so she'd stop yelling but she wouldn't let me. Finally, we went to go get gas at Sam's and she yelled cuz I didn't know what I was doing with the gas and so ya we finally went to Kev's. I showed up at his house with like a 10 ft. sweater and bummy hair. haha My mom was all pissed off I left my phone, I went to tb and I was wearing this certain sweater so she decides to tell me that "my mistakes cost everyone something" and i'm like thanks ya know. god. So then for some reason I HAD to go to the mall while tim and my mom were in the gym. I didn't really want to but whatever, I went anyways. I got 2 shirts from 5-7-9, those and the 2 shirts I got from express, earings and a cd..I bought quite a lot this weekend for someone who's almost broke. After the mall I came home and tried to just chill for a while but then Arthur IM'd me saying he wanted to go get a bite to eat. That was fine with me cuz I didn't want 2 be moping around and I owed him for that one time I ditched him, sorry hun. Dennis called him and wanted to come too so he did. It was fine going there cuz I knew the route kinda but as soon as I entered gates oh man my driving skills went out the window and I never got them back lol. I got to Arthur's after a lot of reversing and what not and got to Dennis fine. We chilled at Dennis' for a bit so they could "study". They told me to call Kev so I did but he wasn't answering so then we left for Barnaby's. Okay fucking get this...I didn't see a stop sign by the park at the gates and I was doing like 40 over the stop sign and right as how I'm supposed to leave the gates there's a fucking cop behind me with his lights on and I got pulled over. My heart stopped :'( He asked for my license and insurance. I was trying to hold in tears cuz of the boys there but I was scared outta my mind. Then another cop comes by this cop and after like 5 minutes they finally tell me that it was just a warning and be careful cuz there's lots of lil kids. I was so scared and when we got to Barnaby's I was still in shock lol. Anyways so we got food and talked about girlfriends and what not, it was kool. Dennis was telling me his metro story lol. Then we talked about my puke from Dennis' house and they told me something I didn't know which now I think is really sweet and makes me think he did used to care..anywho, then art was talkin bout his luv problems and food obsession. denis is single now and Art might be soon. Best luck to both of them. Then I had 2 drive them 2 get cigarettes and ya it was a kool time and all but it kinda made me realize how I kinda don't want this summer to come, it won't be like last summer for me and I don't want it..well I'm gonna go eat and watch the Lakers game now. Bye "i never meant to be so cold"
