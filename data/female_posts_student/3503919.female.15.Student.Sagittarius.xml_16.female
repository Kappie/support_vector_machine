Yesterday morning was a rushing one, as I woke up late and I am having remedial lessons .. Quickly bath and then went out.. My father brought me to school and wanpin and Amy had already reach.. Then we went to our classroom and they were about to start the remedial ... Starting was math .. Ok lohz, keep drawing graph, new topic, reflection and rotation... Then I never brought my graph paper to school so have to borrow from ppl ... sianz ...  After maths was chemistry ... kinda tired already ... See that teacher, I already sian 1/2 liaoz then somemore is chemistry then confirm sianz dao wan liaoz lohz ... Want sleep also cannot, copying notes ... Ok lahz but still stay awake until the lesson end... Gonna hand in chemistry homework but as usual I never do ... So Amy and I went off without handing it in ... Then waiting for Wanpin at the foyer as she went to get her report book from tt teacher ... Then saw Annie .. She show mi the grouping for the this coming library camp ... That's mean tml lohz .. tml going for camp le ...  Went home after that and then went out again to buy my lunch ... Eat finish then I went back to my computer and started trying out that shoutcast thingy ... Tried so long but couldn't work ... First is the IP, second is the password, third is ppl cannot hear ... So much things ... OMG ! Ask Mak ... He also dunno why ... I ask Liyi to try listening but she also cannot hear, Peiyu too ... Too tired then I went to take a nap ... That was about 5 plus  Woke up at 7 plus .. Mother drag me up as she ask me to eat my dinner ... But I was too full and I ate a few mouth and stop eating ... Watch TV ... And came online ... Keep asking peiyu and amy to try hearing see whether it works but starting it really cannot ... Then I went to seek help from  JunChi  ... Woo, he is really great ...  ...(To JunChi : really sorry sia ... Very paiseh lehz ... But really thanks to you cause at last it works ...)  Then ask Peiyu and Amy to try again ... And finally succeeded .. So happy, but something went wrong again, it was the mic, cause I put the input as Winamp(Recommanded) but if I wanna talk I would have to change to Soundcard input ... Then just changed right ? But if I change my voice or even the music will turn to a baby voice, kinda weird right .. haiz .. Ask Mak he say he dunno ... haiz .. But later I try again Peiyu say my voice was ok le ... But still abit worrying ... Aiya nvm lahz ..  Went off at 10 plus ? ... Not too sure ... Cause is that my brother wanted to use the comp lohz ... aiya then let him use lohz ..    [.J.u.S.t.P.a.S.s.I.n.'.B.y.]Signed off at SGT-1042 Hrs
