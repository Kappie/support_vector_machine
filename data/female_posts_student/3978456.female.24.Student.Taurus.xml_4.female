However, at tha quarter-life, it'z "oh god it'z rite here where i'm either gon'make my life or i'm gon' be a miserable worthless sack of *!%$ foreva." This iz tha point in our livez, kiddies, where u realize dat even if u da shit, dere'z someone out dere who'z gon' be more da shit den u are. so u gotta decide: should i be a good li'l law student (even tho my frienz scored 178 on the lsat and i didn't), or should i follow tha dream and write and sing (even tho i ain't even close to tha best singer/writer i kno, let alone out there)? it'z a helluva trauma to suddenly not be tha best. but u kno what? it makez u realize just how very important it is, at that point, to be a decent person. utterly hate quoting cheezy movie linez, but this one really opened my eyes, even tho it should be obvious: "It's not our abilities, Harry, that make us who we are: it's the choices we make." And so: judging yourself by your raw ability, mediocre or not, is a fool's game. It's like judging yourself by the color of your skin. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T CHANGE. So cut yourself some slack. It's what you do with your abilities, and who you touch. That's what's important in life, cuz ultimately that is what makes a difference and what lasts, cuz not much else does, lemme tell ya. Acourse, if you're me, and have minimal social skillz, and sometimes can barely tolerate people even while still needing them to function in a human way, i'd say yep: time to panic. ;) j/k. but IMHO strong friendship connections are things that are truly valuable when they last, and age like fine wine - the older u get, tha harder it iz to meet new people u kno u can trust close to you and yours. too bad fer lazy peepz like me, maintaining connection way harder'n jes' meetin new people...      current gripe: people who keep trying to speak jamaican to me. stop mauling tha language, people. (as if i should talk.) and, as always,  those bastardz ova at da CHP.  oh, it's just your job to give out tix? u kno u love it, assholes. hell'z too good fer u. may u rot in one of those demon dimensions where they shove pineapples up ur ass many times daily. (whoops, ok shout-out to adam sandler there, even tho he'z pretty lame lately.)      current entrancement: los lonely boys! yes, they're on the radio, so now they're mainstream and useless. sue me, i'm a sellout. i even like their spanish stuff, e'en tho for all i kno dey singin da macarena. 'cept they don't say macarena. so dey prolly ain't singing dat. ok i think i'm done now.
