And he's one to talk, he can't even help me with my homework half the time! Whatever. Nothing satisifies him. Nothing that I do, at least. He said I'm not trying as hard as I should. Ha! I think I did okay on my geometry test today, but who knows. School is so uneventful. Nothing exciting ever really happens. I pray to God that my lunch shift switches next semester, otherwise that would just suck biiiiiiig time.  Got bitched out by Evelyn today for being late for carpool. Sarah and I were trying so hard not to crack up. :-)  Hey, um, yeah, if you know anybody else at ND with AIM, tell them my screen name, because, yeah just do it. Haha.  G'bye.
