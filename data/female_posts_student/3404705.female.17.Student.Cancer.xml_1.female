Ive got an anger management problem, and I know it.  I dont like people telling me not to be angry, that it's not nice to be angry, that anger can destroy me. Because I have the right to my anger, everybody gets angry once in a while, and my anger actually builds me.   I think clearer when I'm angry. My mind works when I'm angry.  I tend to change my sadness or dissapoinments or whatever, to anger, because i can THINK straight.   Is that wrong? Is that so bad?  When I'm angry, i tend to say things I'm not supposed to say. Things that i want to say, but for the good of everyone, cant say. My mouth just shoots them off, when I'm angry.  There's a quote: It is a good rule in life never to apologize. The right sort of people do not want apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of them.  I disagree a bit. (what's new? i disagree with almost everything hehe) I think people should apologize, if they believe they're wrong. Some people say sorry, and dont mean it. Why say it?  One thing I do know, is that when someones sorry, really sorry, and apologize, they got my salute. Afterall, it takes someone big to stand up and say they're wrong. Right?
