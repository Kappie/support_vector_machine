Anyway, I gotta say that the little b'day party we had for my mom 'n me wuz a whole lot've fun!  Since it was about 3 months ago, I can't  really  remember  all  that we did (getting old, remember?) but we did play soccer at the park and my team won! ...and the guyz played b-ball, while the adults sat around, ate, talked, took pics.... and wutever! I got a lot of presents (..... yeah! ...) but what really counted was that all my loved ones were around to celebrate the coming year along with me! (Awww!)  Anyway, I'll "sut ^" now so that you can view the pics.....
