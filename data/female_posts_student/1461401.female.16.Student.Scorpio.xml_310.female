(even if it's only modest mouse lyrics)  Well all that icing and all that cake,  I can't make it to your wedding, but I'm sure I'll be at your wake.  You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day,  when you get to the point make sure that I'm still awake, OK?   well, ok, not just modest mouse lyrics. It's so wierd, my cell phone tells me it's 8:27, and I'm like nuh-uh honey, it's only half past six! Then I realize, oh yeah, I lost a couple hours at the cla-zel this afternoon. It was fun. Bizzare, but well worth it. If you get a chance, go see Les Triplettes de Belleville (also known as the triplets of belleville). It's bizzare, but well worth it. Just ignore the woman dancing around with no shirt on in the beginning and you'll be alright. Instead, focus on the tap-dancer who gets eaten by his own shoes. Yes, you'll be fine.  yes... i'll be fine...
