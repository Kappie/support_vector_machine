Its really hard sitting in lecture all day listening to these wonderful designers who are so famous and successful and not being able to do anything about it. I know that it all just takes time and commitment, but I am ready to start working and really learning hands on. This week is mainly business lectures- how to set up your own business, what kinds of accounting software to use, all the specification, licensing, trade information. One of the designers who set up her company after graduating from college went on to be very successful and was contacted by ppl in japan to go over there and design restaurants, watches, clothes, etc. She said that once you are a designer, the Japanese ask you to design many different things, not just interiors.... (sigh***) someday maybe.   Well, I am starting on gathering information for my first project. I think it will be so exciting, but at the same time kind of difficult. Its only a 3 star hotel and its main competition are all 5 star hotels. But this beach resort has much better beaches and a better location so I need to start sourcing asap. Tomorrow we will get the client brief and then I can start on my design analysis. We have a long weekend- Friday and Monday off- yeah!! I can catch up on sleep!! On Saturday after work, I am going to Sheffield to visit Pete's family. I'll meet his grandmother, who is going blind. I feel so sorry for her, she wants to meet me and see Pete one more time before she is completely blind. Also, Pete's dad's birthday is coming up. I have no clue what to get men for presents- esp. since I dont know him that well. I dont want to get him anything cheesy ya know? Any suggestions?  Oh, I signed up for some online courses (like I have time i know!) but they are free and I think I will be able to learn alot. I can take courses such as HTML, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, etc- it may be useful so that I can set up my own website someday.
