"yeah, i'm punk all right. i wear ties and sing a song about a 'sk8er boi'." ugggh. and apparently, she said stuff like, "i'm as punk as they come", "i'm punk for the new generation. you don't see britney running around wearing ties and singing punk." ties have been around since before you were born, girlie. aaand, punks don't label themselves. she needs to go die. right now. in a corner. along with her 9 year old fans. also, a quick fact: she was, at a point, a country singer. until her label or whatever the fuck told her to be more "punk", because that's what is "in" right now." yes, little avril. follow the trend. anyways i am going to stop myself before i get into a full-fledged rant about avril la-fucking-vigne. but yeah so, these past 2 days, i was bored so i took a html tutorial. which basically just explained the basic codes of html. if you're interested in taking the tutorial, you can click  urlLink  here  . you can also find it in the links section. anyways. we're having a campfire tonight. woohoo. i actually am taking a break to tell you people about my boooring life. hm. yeah. he brought like fuckin bugspray out and saw a mosquito crawling around on like the arm of a chair and he sprayed it n it was staggerin around n he was like "jodi!! watch him dance!!" i was like "hoh!!!" i guess linz would only  truly  understand that. and ashley. silly hobo jesus. but yea it's dark now so i suppose i should get back out there...hahhaa..byebye...might blog later...but prolly not..we'll see. :)  -joebie
