1)   Kids crack me up and I can't tell you how many stories I've got from my group of pre-schoolers that I think will make other people laugh or think.  

2)   I am not the most creative genius in the world, but, occasionally, I do manage to come up with good activities to help the kids get the story.  

3)   I can appeal to anyone reading this site for ideas when I run out of my own. (Not to mention that my best friend came up with the idea!)  

4)   I figure, if I have trouble thinking of fun, active, creative things to do, there have to be other people out there working with small children, trying to teach Bible stories, who have trouble as well. :)  

5)   Most of all, I'm doing this because I love God, and I think that this will be a great way to help teach little ones about Him.
