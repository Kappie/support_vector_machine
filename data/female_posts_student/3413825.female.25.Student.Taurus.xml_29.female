So what i really shouldve been doing was my work for my final project, but im thinking finding a job is a little more important. so pete informs me that our last day in this flat is july 13th! ok, thats only a little more than a month left. what are we going to do? hum... im supposed to have all this shit figured out by now, but of course things never happen like you plan so ive stopped planning. everyone says it will all fall into place, but i have yet to see that happen. i am waiting anxiously for my dream job to jump into my lap. i dont know whether to stay here in london with pete or go back to the states and get a job there. im so torn and have no clue. sometimes i just wish that someone would make up my mind for me--- because i change mine every second. for the time being, i guess just applying for jobs in london and the states will be good. but i just dont know. why give up a good thing when nothings wrong ya know? hmmm... lots to think about, but after doing some thinking over the past 9 months i havent come up with an answer so how will one more month give me the answer? yeah right.  well, its midnight. i have to get up tomorrow at 7 and commute 2 hours to school and work on my last project. fun fun.
