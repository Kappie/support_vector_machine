Now starts the cool part: I was looking through the satellite guide, and saw the title of this movie that was on called "Isn't She Great"...I was like, OMG! I've been wanting to see this stupid movie for a loooong time - It has Nathan Lane, Bette Midler, and a whole bunch of other people in it, and it looked/sounded really good - plus I love Nathan Lane, but I don't have satellite so I could never catch it when it was on. So I watched most of that - GOOD MOVIE!  Then I was flipping again after the movie was over and came across the first game in the Lakers/Pistons series...watched that, pretty good game, and then I about peed my pants when Detroit beat the Lakers at the Lakers  homecourt , Staples Center. It was sweeter than a gum drop dipped in frosting! Hahaha  Anyway, that was my good tv experience, not like anyone cares...haha
