And I realllly want to talk to Bryan and can't because he was at a game earlier, and I just tried calling him, and his dad said he'd call me back, and blah. This bites. Plus, I still have to do laundry and homework.  I wish today were Saturday and tomorrow were Sunday. It'd give me so much more time to do things.   Argh, I just feel awful about chris though. I really do. I'm such an idiot. Why am I such an idiot? I think I'm just going to go now and bury myself in history homework. Yeah...that's how upset I am, I'm going to actually do homework.   What a crappy way to end my day.  :(
