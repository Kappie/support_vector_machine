I will weep as I laugh and try to forget the things that will remain forever. There may be some who are trying to bring back the joy in my eyes but it is only you who got the key to open it and bring back to life. I don't fear this moment, the moment of missing you, because I love you and it is enough to confide me. You have my faith even then, and it is still there, growing in my heart for years. I will miss you so much and it is hard to explain why or how or how long will it take. It is difficult to understand but everything comes in a matter of consequences. You taught me everything - to grow, to think, and to be what I am. How can I forget the years in my life that I spent with you? Just tell me how for a relief. And another tear had fallen from my eyes...
