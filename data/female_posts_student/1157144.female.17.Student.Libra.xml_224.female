Mile: i'm doing good, i'm in 3rd when i pass andy, who i tell specifically to hold off the lincoln guy tailing us...andy dies and can't hold him off, so i lose in the end sprint by less than 1/2 a step because i glanced back once. too bad andy could buy me another 1/2 second...but i beat andy, so that's good...but since i lost by so little, i was pretty annoyed, so i walked up to campbell and said "i'm annoyed, so i'm going to run the 1/2 mile" 1/2 Mile: i'm once again doing good, in 3rd in the last straight sprinting against this guy...i'm in lane 1, he's in lane 2. then he breaks my 1st rule: do NOT EVER cut me off, especially when it's the last straight when you're not allowed to change lanes...so (and i really didn't mean to do this at all) the back of my hand glances off him, and he goes flying out into lane 4...i beat him, he's disqualified for cutting me off...then the lincoln coach comes up, and i end up getting disqualified for pushing him. our sprint coach said it was a bad call since i was defending my lane, but no one else cared much...campbell found it quite humorous, all the other branham runners were congradulating me, and quinn shook my hand when i told him the story...but i wasn't annoyed anymore, so it was worth it. my dad has never gotten disqualified, by the way. and my mom was annoyed that i'd pushed the guy, but i don't care. 2 mile: i was worried about the guy who beat me in the mile, so me and andy started off really fast and he dropped back to run with adam...i held on to andy until lap 7, when i ran out of energy...we'd been talking most of the way. so i got 2nd in the 2mile ok, end of story...i'm happy
