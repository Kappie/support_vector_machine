She looks pretty spiffy, but not as good as Kurama and that tux.      Yusuke: I think she should wear a skirt more often. She wouldn't be mistaken for a guy.      Baka: That's cold, dude.      Yusuke: It's true though.      Baka: Shhh... They're talking.      Dais: I'm never wearing a skirt again.      Kurama: I think you look nice, though.      Dais: You and about half the other guys on dates here. (Dais gestures in the general direction of someone behind her)      (Baka turns the camera to the guy)      (Noticing the angered look of his girlfriend he focuses on the girl's face and tries extremely hard to not stare at Dais)      Baka: That dudes busted.      Yusuke: Shoot, if Keiko found me starring at another girl she would knock me out.      Baka: Why am I the only one without a date?      Yusuke: Maybe you should start looking for other girls.      Baka: I'll kill you later.      Dais: We're being watched.      (Baka nearly drops camera)      Baka: Oh crap!      (Baka catches camera before it hits the floor)      Kurama: Just ignore them.      Dais: I plan to.      Kurama: Good.      (Kurama places his arm over Dais' shoulder and pulls her in close)      Kurama: Besides there is always that embarassing footage of Baka sleep-talking.      Baka: What's he talking about?      Yusuke: Uh... I...I don't know.      (Baka puts the camera on the ledge of the window facing her and Urameshi)      (She grabs Yusuke by the collar with both hands)      Baka:  Tell me!      Yusuke:  Ah!  Let me go!      Baka:  Tell me!      Some random person who walks out to smoke who is also off screen:  Hey!  What are you two kids doing out here!?      (Baka and Yusuke look surprised at the person)      (Baka snatches the camera and they both run off)      (Screen goes fuzzy)
