Ohh that for those who are confused, I published dat last blog on Sunday and then sumhow (I have no idea how) I published it agen on Monday… anywayz its been a crazy week. Crazy I tell ya!!  On Tuesday I heard sumfin dat I really wasn’t supposed to hear. Not for a while newaiz. Hehe u prolly all dying to know wat dat little secret is, but I’m not gonna tell u either =) sorry! Lets jus say I’m not sorry that I heard it. although it caught me a bit off guard n left me brain dead for the whole week. Maybe I’m exaggerating a little but that’s seriously wat it felt like. Head saying one thing, heart saying another, head hurting from thinking, heart breaking from hurting, heart changin its mind all da time… well u get me. If u think that this wouldn't affect me at all, ur a silly bugger. Hrmm I betta stop there before I give nethin away. Or have I already? Ok next topic…  Schools been fun. It was really bludgy this week, but that could jus be because I dun do my work newaiz. Big thanku to  anna  who helped me with my maths wen I was sick. I went to her house on Tuesday afta school. Haha its funny, both our mums talk like theres no tomorrow. We were supposed to leave at 7:30ish but ended up leavin at 9:45. They didn’t even realise me n anna were fallin asleep on da couch. I’m so proud of  nita ! I taught her to crochet in english n now she’s makin a mad red beanie. Ooh I’m proud of  larri  too, who figured how to crochet with a pen AND ate a handful of salt in english. Haha we also got our school fotos bac n I’ll scan em n put them up lata for u to look at my beautiful friends.  On Friday I had  KLOZ NCOUNTA  practice. Haha I luv goin there, its jus fun I swear. Tires me out tho which was bad cuz this was one of da few times I was gonna go out aftawards. Big thanku to  danny  for takin me to hillsong. Sorry I was dozin off, dat speaker wasn’t boring, I was jus sleepy.
