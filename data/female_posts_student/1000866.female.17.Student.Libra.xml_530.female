It sort of took me until tonight to get into the Christmas spirit, but...I am now. :) I'm really happy my brother and his girlfriend and my aunt susan and John are here. It's nice. And now, I think I'm going to go to sleep so I can wake up realllly early tomorrow morning, make everyone mad, and open my gifts at like...6:00 A.M. Ahahahaha. I can be evil on Christmas....
