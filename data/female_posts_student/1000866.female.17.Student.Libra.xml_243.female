At least the waitress didn't ask for the diagram this time. I bet, last time, they brought it into the kitchen and hung it up on a board that says, "All-time dumbest customers." Haha, good times. Anyway, then we went back to Kelly's and just hung out for a while. It was fun. We played Clue, and some other games and we talked and stuff. We are such losers though. All of us were like, ready to sleep by 11:00 so we just watched Clueless, and then we acted really dumb, because I don't know, because we get silly when we're tired, and Joanne and I were making funny noises, like a like a like a like a like a like a like...semi truck. Haha, "I have so much energy I could run a marathon from Athens to Greece!" Haha, good times good times. Good inside joke sleepover. Oh, and when we watched Clueless, I haven't actually watched that movie in years, and a LOT more of it made sense to me now, like the whole thing where she asks if they have herbal refreshments and stuff. Haha, funny times, funny times.   I didn't get like ANY sleep though. My back hurts so much. I think I must have done something to it. Before it just sort of hurt, now I think it's trying to kill itself. Self-destructing back. Whooo. So, whenever I try to get up from lying down, it kills and blah. I don't like you back! Plus, Kelly's house is extremely warm compared to mine, so...I was really warm all night. Ah well, it was fun just the same.   And now, I have to go clean since my parents are having a party. I think I'll magically dissapear when people start coming though. I don't like being around too many grown-ups. It's scary.
