It was a loonnnnggggggg night without him here.  Today Grandma Lu went with me to the doctor for Nick's 1st shots. Nick was so happy  before  the shots...he was smiling like crazy and cooing. After a "head size" scare we found out Nick is in the 90% tile for height  95% tile for weight. He is a big boy and absolutely perfect! Two nurses came into the examination room to give Nick his shots. 1 nurse held his legs while my mom  I had to hold onto Nick's arms and the second nurse gave Nick 3 shots. My mom was rubbing my back during the ordeal because I have a tendency to faint at the sight of blood and Nick did bleed...A lot! Poor Poor Poor Boy. He has been sleeping other than waking once to eat ever sense we got home. He did a great job!~Very Brave! Shawn started at PDL today!!! He gets to wear a hard hat, glasses, a PDL windbreaker, eventually stealtoe shoes, and a identification badge! His bosses took him out to Ruby Tuesday's for lunch. This internship is like an interview and Shawn will do an amazing job so it looks like we might be moving to the cities area once Shawn graduates! I'm excited. It sounds like Shawn had a pretty good 1st day. He is tired though-he has to leave Megan  Dave's house by 5:30am to get to work in the  bad  traffic.  This evening Nick and I went to Keely's soccer game and she did an incredible job! Nick slept the whole time...In fact, he's  STILL  sleeping! Hopefully he'll sleep through the night.
