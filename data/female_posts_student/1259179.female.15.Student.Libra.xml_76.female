No pressure.  Got my first paycheck... yaaaaahooooo..  ALL GONE... :(  One next week  :))))  I have not been on a little while,  I am sorry to all my readers... hi hi hi...    I started looking for a new design for my blog and  urlLink  ~ Sandee ~ and I found some nice ones.  She thinks I have tacky taste...  Anyways,  I will search for more and hopefully she will be able to do it for me.  I need a change..  Well I started Weight Watchers (yet again) but no I am not going to meetings.  There is 3 ladies at work that go so I have all my books and points counter and I join in with them...  So far so good..  I eat 27 points... but not enough water.  day by day, pound by pound.  Well I am pooped so..........Be Good
