I layed in the bed and stared at the ceiling till dad made me get up at like 12:30....I took a shower and got ready, then I went and turned in my application for Subway! FUN FUN! after that I came home and mom and brylee and nate went to burger king in albertville to play and I was home by myself....I unpacked my bags from Dauphin Island :( and then I tried to pick up my room a little bit...ALLISON(my room mate) called me and that ROCKED! we talked for a little while, but I had to let her go b/c the stupid phone was dying! Then I watched some tv and jessi called and said she was coming over to give me my present....oh..jonathan called somewhere in between that and said he was gonna come over sometime too...anyway...I picked up the downstairs a LITTLE bit and then j.b. and jess came over...she got me cards (WHICH I REALLY NEEDED) 2 things of chapstick, 2 roses, and a picture frame!!! I had to go to wal*mart and take one of the chapsticks back b/c it was plain and i only like strawberry and sometimes cherry! *THEY DO MAKE STRAWBERRY PHIL* then after that i sat at home and waited for mom to get home....well, she got home and we ate "bashgetti" YUCK....after that i sat around in my room..looking at the walls a little bit more...around 10:30 jordan, ben, john, robson, evan, and savannah came over to play cards..that was fun but it made me miss christa!! I cant wait till the 18th...thats the first time we get to get a phone call from her! Its only for 10 minutes which sucks.....then we get another one on the 7th of august!!! I miss her bunches!! oh well...I WATCHED FINDING NEMO TONIGHT WITH THE BOYS, AND IT ROCKED! "just keep swimming, just keep swimming" "whats the matter grumpy gills" aww...i miss D.I.     :( anyway, im out
