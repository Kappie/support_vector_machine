The data collection is one of the most challenging aspects of the CTA process for several reasons: 1) much knowledge is tactic or automatic, 2) knowledge may be difficult to verbalize, and 3) subject matter experts may tend to simplify when conveying their knowledge to a non expert, or simply provide whatever knowledge is accessible (Cooke, 1994).   More notes about PARI, which was introduced in the last post: PARI Method (Precursor, Action, Result, Interpretation):  A method developed primarily to capture the cognitive and behavioral demands of troubleshooting complex systems.  This method is particularly suited to developing training programs.  The approach consists of a structured interview in which novice and expert troubleshooters diagnose a fault in a problem scenario posed by another expert.  The outputs are PARI diagrams of both expert and novice solutions to a representative set of troubleshooting problems.  At each step of the solution, an Action is taken because of a Precursor, the Action produces a Result, and the Result of that Action is Interpreted.  Also, at each step, problem solvers are asked to draw a diagram representing their current mental model of the state of the system.  A streamlined version of this method has also been developed.            References: Marsh, C.  "The F-16 Maintenance Skills Tutor."

A more apprehensive/complext CTA method:  Skill-Based CTA Framework: A framework for conducting CTA that assumes simpler cognitive skills form the basis for more advanced skills, and it attempts to identify the hierarchy of skills needed to operate in a domain.  This hierarchy, starting at the most complex skill type, includes: Strategies, Decision-Making Skills, Representational Skills, Procedural Skills, and Automated Skills.  They propose that existing CTA techniques can be used to get at each of the skill types they identify.    - Automated skills can be analyzed by the Consistent Component Method and the Verbal Report Method (aka Think Aloud),   - procedural skills can be analyzed by PARI,   - representational skills (elements of mental models that can predict required actions) can be analyzed using  Diagramming and Rating/Sorting knowledge elicitation techniques,   - decision making skills can be analyzed with the Critical Decision Method, Error Analysis, and Verbal Report Methods.   - Strategies can be analyzed with the Team Communications method and the Structured Interview method.  This framework has been used to develop training programs in the Air Traffic Control domain.  References: Redding, R. E. A Standard Procedure for Conducting Cognitive Task Analysis.

Knowledge elicitation techniques (Reynolds  Brannick): http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~mbrannic/files/biog/CTASIOP_02.htm  (see table 1) Some techniques are better suited to elicit declarative knowledge, while others are more effective for procedural knowledge.    CTA could lead to training innovations (e.g. overcome cognitive overload) It could also be used to design tasks and jobs in order to optimize performance
