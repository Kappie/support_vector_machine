It's a vicious cycle, because every night I am up late, and then I sleep late into the next day and am unable to get started, and am up late again the next night...I think you get the picture.  Part of it is my schedule, since I only actually have to get up early two days a week, so I'm more prone to stay up late (which I like) and sleep late (which I like even more).  So, I need help getting it in gear.  So, send me prayers or keep your fingers crossed, or send me happy mental thoughts or whatever it is that you do so well...unless of course you like the idea of me tossing and turning in bed at 3 AM, in which case you may feel free to ignore my plight.    So now I'm trying to muddle my tired self through the day.  I'll make it though, with the help of my good friend, the Dew.  Though I have to be careful not to drink any too late, because I don't want the caffeine messing up my system.  I want to be tired enough to drift off into peaceful slumber tonight...
