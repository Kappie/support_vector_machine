He is over here right now, and we are playing cool games, looking at pics of decapitated people, watching CKY, making really funny music videos (Alex is now lead guitarist, he is god), and eating good stuff. We were going to walk to necessary ten miles to Taco Bell, but chickened out due to the fact that we don't want to get shot real bad, so we didn't. Alex says we can go there tomorrow. And I agree.  Now, were going to do something else. Pus...I mean, Alex wants to go to sleep. It's only three and a half you fuck. What the HELL dude? You're such a woman. Only women go to sleep early. That leaves the men to sit around and drink and smoke expensive cigars/weed (at Alex's request). Ok, I'm going to shut up now so as to not get in trouble with women any more than I already will (especially with Abby...*tears* I miss her so).  Alright kids. G'nite for now. Wow, it's cool that I can type so good.
