Do I just not have a brain or something?! Obviously not, stupid question really, but that's all that we can expect from someone with no brain anyway, so it doesn't really matter. :P   Yes, well, anyway... tonight I went to a play at my school. It was called "After Juliet" (yes, you would be right if you saw the link between that and the title) and it was done by a bunch of people in my college sector... Phoebe was great in it, she always is, nothing but praise for the girl. *nods* I always feel bad for Peter though. I just can't help it, he's one of those people who, to put it in the words of the great Dr. Phil "just doesn't get it"! He stoopingly trudged onto the stage and said his lines with his half slobbery lisp and I just wanted to go down there and throttle him to make him wake up to himself.  He thinks he's going to NIDA.  He's not.  I'm no expert, nowhere near, but there will be no NIDA for that boy. *le sigh* It's terrible, he's so sweet, I just... oh God, I don't know what I just. He is sweet, but also very very weird... sweet and weird... weird in a scary way too...  Another thing about another cast member from After Juliet; a guy I will refer to solely as "A" for the purpose of keeping things simple. I just don't get him.  Granted, I mostly don't get any guys in general, but him especially! He's not the best looking guy in the world, no one in their right mind would deny that, but he's just got soooo much... charisma? I guess the word is? He's downright cheeky too. :P Like tonight, he came over to our group, so I hugged him and told him what a great job he did - which he of course already knew but accepted my compliment graciously.  But of course it wasn't just a hug, he held onto me, he held my hands and kissed them, he touched my face, and he is the only guy in the world that can get away with pinching my butt in public. *laughs* I've got no idea how or why but he has this ironic knack of being able to make you seem really special and important, when he'll literally go and do exactly the same thing to another girl a minute later! He's charming and funny, and all the while completely enfuriating... *sighs* I guess A is a topic for another day though, because i'm determined to figure him out. *nods*  Also another topic for another day, the issue/tough sitch i've gotten myself into with a guy we'll call Blondie and another we'll call Blackie (ha! Forgive my lame sense of humour. :P), the gossip that's going around about me and getting me down, and the strange, quirky, upbeat-down Gushie who is on my mind for a number of reasons.  Lotsa love n such, Simbles xoxo
