I hate missing this much school, especially at this point in the semester, but given that I can barely talk or think, perhaps it is for the best.  Thanks for the well wishes everyone...except for Gary, who has been very mean to me ;-)...they have made me smile and brightened up my sickness filled days just a bit.
