Yeah yeah, you might be thinking I'm a goody-two-shoes, since that's the first time I've been grounded. I'm not, really, since I've been doing the thing that got me in trouble for a long time now - I've just never been caught.  It wasn't so bad, actually. I wasn't grounded fully - just in the sense that I couldn't use the internet, which was what got me in trouble in the first place. Not that I had anywhere to go, anyways.  I've got an girls' open gym for basketball today, but I don't want to go. First of all, out of a team of about 14, only five girls have shown up each day (including me), so we've had to play with the coaches. And yesterday, I was wearing sandles (I didn't feel like putting on my bball shoes just yet) and my brother started playing around with me, pretending to punch and kick me. He accidentally hit the tip of my toenail with his shoe, and ripped part of it off.  I went to basketball anyways, since my toe only stung a little bit. At first, it hurt like hell, but then it softened down to a little throbbing and a stinging like when you touch a cut with your finger and it's dirty. That kind of sting.  But then, when I was going up to rebound a ball, my coach jumped up to grab it from me, stomping on my toe and knocking me over in the process. I was okay for a bit, but then my toe started really throbbing and it was painful, so I sat out. I got back in the game, though, only to have my nose elbowed so it hurt a bit.  And  then , to make matters worse, my knee started hurting like crap so I couldn't run very well. I was hobbling >.  Anyways, back on my original point - I don't want to go to the open gym because of my toe. It's really sore now, and I don't think I can deal with another person stomping on my toe. Plus I'm not into the whole impacted knee thing.  I wouldn't be so whiny about my toe, but that was my  good  toe. My other one had an ingrown toenail that keeps coming and going - right now it's gone, but if somebody lands on it it'll start to bleed and be there again.  So basically, I have a sucky body.
