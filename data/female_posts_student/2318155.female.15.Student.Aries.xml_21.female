On Monday boring, Tuesday I snuck off campus at lunch and me and alissa went to subway, On Wednesday me and alissa, devin, omid, and chris went off campus at lunch again and then we got caught by tony! On Thursday Alissa kinda talked with me, but she got in hella trouble and like was all ignoring me a lot. So, on Friday I hung with Jessika Spitieri. Jessika and I get along real well it's just that the people she hangs out with kinda scare me and I feel weird around so I think that imma hang with someone else on Monday. On Friday I went to the dance with Brandon and we had tons of funn!!!! Afterwards we went to In-N-Out and had some burgers! On Saturday I got my hair cut and then we picked up brandon and took him to my house. We wrestled while my mom went and got some el balazo and then afterwards watched "a man apart" and then he had to leave. I went and babysat from 5-11 and got home more like 11:30. Today I woke up at 1 and then talked on the phone with brandon, then i went and took a shower, and then blowdryed my hair. Then, I sat at home most of the day, and then my parents wanted to go out to dinner. We went to Celias and then went to Blockbuster to get "Bruce Almighty". Now I'm home about to have some tapioca and watch "Bruce Almighty". This week has been ok other than the incident with alissa, but hey whatever. I think I may go now cause i smell tapioca and it smells realllly good. Until next time...
