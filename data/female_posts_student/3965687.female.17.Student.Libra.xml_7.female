It doesn't offend me, because I know how men work up to a point. And all of this, plus everything that has gone on with Van --my ex, for all two of you who don't know-- has made me realize one simple truth: I am never going to be able to obtain my dream. Again, for all two of you readers (about whom I care, at any rate) who don't know my dream, it is this: a well-paying and stimulating job as a Ph.D. with my own office, a large house in New Orleans or Charleston, a good and dependable husband with a steady job, two girls and three boys, and hopefully a set of twins somewhere in that number. I can get the job I want, provided I can pay off the next three years of college, and can in that time come up with the money for graduate school...but I don't believe I'll ever have the kind of married or family life I want. I don't know that I will have either of those at all, in any condition. As time goes on, I believe less and less in love. I am actually beginning to question its existance, something I have never before done...and what is worse is that I feel justified in my lack of faith. I have been told that everyone experiences a time like this, and that something extraordinary happens to prove their atheism of love wrong, yet to a majority of the people I know precicely the opposite has occurred. I don't know....I'm waiting for something to change my mind....although, at this point, I don't know that anything can.
