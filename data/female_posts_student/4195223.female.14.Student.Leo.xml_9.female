I love Kyle, and before me and Jacob... I wanted to be with Kyle ((infact I still do, But obviously not as strongly)). But Kyle has a girlfriend now, and I hate her... Her name is Sam. ((short for 'Same' like Same as all those other stupid hoes :) )) He apparently Loves her... or something like that... or so he tells me CONSTANTLY!! Ergh...  
  
 ........... Or so I've said, He's been slowely leaving me... and I miss him, and I still Need him, and now I'm sad ;( . Dont worry you'll here more about this later.. For sure.
