The movie was very well written, and the main character, played by Jared Leto, and his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connelly, delivered excellent performances.  Each character ends up worse than they already started, and I have vowed to never see this movie again.  I can't even figure out what to write I'm so disgusted.  Watching this movie makes me want to overdose on something... anything... just to get the thoughts of it out of my head.  My head is spinning, and I feel like I want to vomit.  Good movie... if you aren't good with violence and intense imagery, do NOT see it... even I got sick.  It's been 20 minutes since it ended and I still feel like I want to vomit.  :(
