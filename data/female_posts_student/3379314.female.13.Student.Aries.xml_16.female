So my plan is im not going to be here for all that crap. im going over friends houses! like yesterday this whole strike thing started and i went to zoes and i cleaned her half of the room. so now her whole half is all clean and then we put tape down the middle of the room which ment aria was not aloud to leave any of her crap on that side. lol.... and then we went to the movies with courtney and jessica. we saw van helsing and it ad to be the most boring movie ever. but i had so much fun becouse i threw popcorn at people and then i forgot to turn my cell phone off and spencer called it so in the middle of the movie confessions started going off. so i sang to it lol! yeah and then like 3 times this guy in front of us kept telling us to shut up and evertime hee said that i would stick my tunge out at him. it was so funny. so after the movie courtneys mom picked us up and we were just sitting in the parking alot for a lil while bc ashley and her mom were eating ice cream,. and olivia provey was just staring at us so mrs. luara waved at her it was so funny, so yeah then she dropped me and zoe off at zoes house and we watched sacarry movie three. so i got one day down as not being at my house only 6 more days left lol. so yeah im bored and if u guys wanna do something with me i would defently be able to! call me  Samie
