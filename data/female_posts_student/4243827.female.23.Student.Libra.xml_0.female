Enrolling is such a fascinating thing for me. When I went to junior college we had to fill out carbon copy forms, and submit them to our advisor, who turned them in to someone else. Eventually, we would find out if we got into classes. Enter 2004 and the computer enrollment system. I can add all of my classes in about thirty seconds and know immediately if there are any problems. Not that junior college wasn't great for some things... I just can't really remember a lot from then. I wan't exactly focused, and wasted a lot of time, and money, and resources. Now, I'm left to think about that when I begin getting ready for a new semester. There are so many classes I could have taken for free and gotten out of the way years ago. Here I am paying out the nose for them. Such a waste. My half-decade-waste-of-life should be saved for another day and another post, though. Speaking of waste... I spent the greater part of the day arguing w/ a two-year old about waste. She's a bit fickle and likes to start eating something, change her mind, and get something else out. This drives me crazy. We end up throwing away tons of food. I told her I was going to buy a lock for the refridgerator so she couldn't get into it. She thought that was hilarious. I suppose if waste is genetic... I'm in trouble
