This time of year gets very busy and exciting as we approach Triduum, and especially Easter.  Sunday night, I commenced the tedious, yet necessary, administrative preparation.  This includes calling 20 some-odd dancers--with that cute secretary voice-- and signing them up to dance for this coming Easter season.  I then created "Important Information" sheets for parents and their dancers about when we will be dancing and what to wear each Sunday.  *Deep breath*  Then, I throw together a sign-in sheet on the computer, asking for all their contact information and which masses they will be dancing at.  Tonight, the night before, I will be looking over choreography and planning a time schedule to adhere to at practice.  Sounds like a lot of work, right?    Here's my frustrating dilemma:  This program used to fall into the responsible hands of Katie and Becky.  Being in college, they have been extremely busy, which makes it hard to put a lot of energy into this fragile program.  Last fall, right before their immersion trip to Los Ni√±os, they passed down the authoritative torch to me for good.  I gladly accepted the challenge.  I choreographed and coordinated a successful Advent season.  So, you might ask, What's your dilemma Megan?  I'm getting to it...  Katie sends me an e-mail this past week, after all my hard work, saying that she is planning to set up rehearsal soon and get the ball rolling.  Okay...I nicely reply that I am running a rehearsal on Friday, from 4-6pm in the church with the little kids and the older dancers.  Basically, the thesis of her next e-mail to me was, Well Becky and I weren't expecting you to do that.  She later says that she is happy she has that time off to come to the rehearsal to help run things.  Excuse me?  Isn't she the one who wanted out?  I'm the one doing all the work here and she just prances in last minute to make it look like she contributed?!  I'm definetely NOT okay with that!  I already have this rehearsal planned down to a science!  So again, I politely respond that I am confused about my role in this process and that I thought she and Becky were trying to get out of this commitment to pursue other goals at  urlLink SCU .  I said that I felt like I was doing all this work and they were just popping in and out whenever.  Then I said that that was fine, but I just needed clarification.  No reply yet.  Oh, by the way, they are only going to be there for the Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday.  Not for the whole Easter season.  I feel like I am in charge of this ministry and that they are being arrogant by trying to stick there heads in every once and a while to check in on me.  Not ok!  I do like control.  Maybe part of that is why it frustrated me that she would try to push herself to being in charge.  But I enjoy leading this ministry and I work hard to keep it going.  Maybe it is pride...maybe even arrogance on MY part.  Either way, I have to communicate my feelings because that is the way I feel, and I don't believe there's a wrong or a right way to feel.  One just has to feel whatever he/she is feeling and express it...  Thank God for blogs!  ;)
