Run kiddies! I KNOW 70% AAARGH! Hmm... this thing needs a whack. *KERPLUMP* (Don't ask, it sounds cool! Well... it does to me, and I'm a bit weird...) Ok, so I gave up on it, hey, 70 isn't my number. 851... (no, you don't wanna know that) is my number! Okay, hand up! Who fed me sugar? Mmm... I'm quite moody actually... back to depressed! YEAY! Oh, happy again. *sigh* As much as I'm sure you want to know about my mood swings and my life (*COUGH*) I better go do some thing! Toodles!
