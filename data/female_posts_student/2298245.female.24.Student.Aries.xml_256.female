He also links to the text of Morris'  urlLink acceptance speech from the Academy Awards  where he actually thanked Robert McNamara, saying "...if he hadn't done it there would have been no film."  I confess I have not seen the film - mainly because I have not had the time.  But when I do get the time, I will see it, though it'll probably be out on video by then.  But it sounds to me like the art of propaganda is not dead; in fact, it is alive and well and, judging by the last two years' Best Documentary winners at the Oscars (this film and Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine last year), it is something that is more than tolerated.
