Not as well as I had hoped... but it was good enough. We made a good deal of money; I only saw 10% though...  I, personally, don't think it was worth it, but hey! I'm not gonna complain. I've got fifty bucks in my pocket, a somewhat happy mother, and a chillin' set of sisters.   We leave for the cabin in six days. Won't that be LOADS of fun. Stuck in an inclosed space, no computer or internet access, no TVS... Just water... and dirt... And nasty fish. I can't wait.... Really.   *Pisses herself in intisipation*  Yes... We're all be so RELAXED there. (That is, if we don't see each other)  Not much else to talk about really. I better go.  ambler
