(they have proven themselves to be that dumb) By the time he is done closing his store, and I'm done closing mine, and the storm is over, there is not a car in the parking lot except both of ours. We laugh, we hug, and he's like let me know if anything happens I will get my fraternity brothers together, and we'll kick his ass.  Jason is uber nice.  I talked to him today again, and told him everything that had happened.  He asked how I was, and I told him that it has made me physically sick.  And I was embarassed for myself and for him.  I can't eat.  I don't want to eat. I cried myself to sleep last night.  He, like me, is all but prejudice against homos.  I can't help it.  It is so disgusting and repulsive.  I only have like two friends who are, and I get the heebie jeebies from Zac.  I wonder so many things.  So many questions will always be unanswered. I wonder if he really truly cared for me.  Did he ever imagine I was a guy?  Did he cheat on me?   I doubt he would have broken up with me, and I imagine he was going to cheat on me with guys.  Was he ever going to tell me, and if he was, did he think that I would be cool with two guys in the bedroom?  Gah. I don't know what to think.  I want to yell at him.  I want to hurt him.  I want to file charges. (but he may be happy because he'll be getting butt sex. =P)  I want him to be miserable, unhappy.  He is a festering sore on everyone's back.
