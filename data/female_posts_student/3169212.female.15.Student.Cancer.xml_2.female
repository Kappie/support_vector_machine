Koda put some credits on the table for the ale and followed the half-breed out of the establishment.  He stayed at her heels directly, knowing that she might pull her lightsaber before knowing the whole story.  The two of them came to where the two guards were trying to climb the wall clumsily.  "Oi!  Dumb-ass duo!" she yelled to the two.  They turned their heads to see a tall, slender woman all in shadow except for the neon iridescence of a silvery green laser blade.  The guards, having not gotten far up the wall, jumped down and began walking towards Koda and Jinix.  The two Corellians remained unfased by the approaching sentinels, even when they pulled their blasters from the holsters.  "Why the hell were you chasing an innocent?" Jinix asked ferociously.  "It's none of your business.  We'll let you live if you just walk away now," responded one of them.  "No, if you bastards 'just walk away' then  we'll  let you live," Koda said.  "Fine."  One of the guards held the blaster level with Nikeli's head.  He never had the time to pull the trigger.  Jinix had suddenly turned up behind him and had shoved her saber through the guards torso.  The other guard turned to face the woman.  He had paled to a terrified milky white and, though it was dark in the alley, his pupils had reduced to the size of pinpoints.  Jinix, in an almost arrogant gesture, turned off her blade, clipped it to her side, and punched the guard in the face.  The guard was knocked out and he fell limply to the floor.  "All of that build up and that's all the action we get," she shook her hand.  "Hard jaw, though.  Nearly popped a blood vessel."  "Where'd you suppose that woman got to?" Koda asked.  "She's unconscious on the top of the wall."  "Never cease to amaze me."  Jin shrugged and leapt agily to the roof.  Nikeli followed her.  Jinix was examining the wound on the woman's leg.  "It's not bad, but not good either.  Probably should take her to the Alliance base here."  Koda lifted the light woman in his arms without a response.
