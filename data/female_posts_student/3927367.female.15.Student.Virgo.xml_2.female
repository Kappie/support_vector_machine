The first time I've eaten halibut, shrimp, clam chowder, lobster, and crab. The first time i've been allowed to walk around a city after 7, much less a city i did not know. The first time i've ever gone dune-buggying. Fun stuff...sort of.  The ocean was so gorgeous. It went on forever, and the clouds were hanging above it, but way out to sea. It also seemed like the clouds were trying to mimic the magesty of the waves, because they were curving around eachother. They were rounded off a little, just like the rolling surf. It all made me feel very small, and very alone at the same time. The thing i wanted most of allthis weekend was to have Tyler with me so that we couldbuild a small bonfire, roast 'mallows, and just sit and watch the sun sink below the horizon.
