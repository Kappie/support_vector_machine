I'm still recovering from the past weeks of stress and loss since my baby left.. Holidays are less appealing now..cos I know I've to endure through it and patiently wait for him to return.. Maybe tt's why I wanted to start going to gym and hit the pool once again juz to keep myself busy...   Rite now, I've to concentrate on getting my cover letter and resume done.. I pray I can find one in my outgoing box frm my email account... I really dislike the idea of marketing yourself as a commodity to prospective slave-drivers.. darn such is life.. I don't wanna come across as outlandish but I do hope mine can catch their eye... but how to strike tt balance...hmmm something to consider.. Okie I better do some research on their company... BCG Consulting here I come
