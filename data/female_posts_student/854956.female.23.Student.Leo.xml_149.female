Druck's riding with me.  We're going to see the midnight showing of LoTR:  Return of the King tonight with Melissa, Ricky, and whomever else comes along.  It's going to be great!  I've been waiting for the last one since Two Towers came out on DVD!!!  We're coming back tomorrow morning... then I get to go to work... :-\  BLAH!  This is my last week of work til January 6th... I love that!  I'm ready for the weekend, too!  We're going to Mr. Sinus on Saturday and then we're all getting together to hang out.  I think that we're going to attempt making a gingerbread house out of gingerbread this year... I  think .  We'll see what happens... All we have to do is buy a bunch of that ready made gingerbread from HEB... but, if we're going to make houses we really need to use some royal icing this year instead of the stuff you buy in the store... or we're going to have the same problems we had last year with it falling in on itself and stuff.  I'll have to check into this stuff before Saturday... :-)  Anyhow, it's off I go... I'm gonna hop in the shower and then off I go in search of Christmas presents for loved ones and friends... :-D
