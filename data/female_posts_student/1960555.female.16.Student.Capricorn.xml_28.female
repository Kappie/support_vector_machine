You're supposed to be the one that tells me that I'm not allowed to like him!!  Rar!!!  I'm so confused.  Claude, how about you just tell him.  Get it out in the open.   NEW YEARS RESOLUTION:::: Thou shalt not be wimpish when it cometh to the othereth sexeth.   Claude, you can tell him, and that'll help me complete my resolution.  (It's a baby step!) ..... just make sure I'm not around.... ;) But in all fairness, he said he hated me, and i'm like "i love you".  (now that was a wee bit of an exaggeration... but it got the point across.... oh and thanks for laughing... that made it really subtle).  Anyhoo.... that's my plan for this year... and the standard (that'll never be kept) I want to get the model look (meaning, get hot), get rich, famous and successful.   ...I'm just wrambling now, so I should get to bed.  I don't even know what time it is... although i think Amy's gunna have to go do her paper route soon.... oh, it's 4:03am, yea, I think I should maybe go to bed soon.  I'm just riled up from the Chilli Peppers and Foo Fighters DVDs.  'Night kids.
