I think it is very under rated and it had definitely grown on me since I first got the CD (John Mayer "Heavier Things", that is).  I went to Leominster movie theater with Sar and Hannah and their friend Kelsey to see "50 First Dates" and it was actually really good, way better than any of us thought it would be.  And we hung around near all the sketchy ghetto people before Mrs. Sushchyk picked us up.  Not with them, just near them: big big difference there.  I saw Sara Winkler and her boyfriend (so random) and then we examined my data match and talked about annoyign people from middle school on the way home.  It was a par-tay.  Good nighty, lovey dove.
