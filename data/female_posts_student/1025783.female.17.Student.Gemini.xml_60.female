Well, I'm not I'm sick of running around and just when I think I'm free I hit myself on a wall So I'm going to leave you now I'm going to leave your box, and your rules But I'll probably be back tommorow Because there's not a lot to do around here So....You all have fun today in your box And I will live outside of it....just for a day
