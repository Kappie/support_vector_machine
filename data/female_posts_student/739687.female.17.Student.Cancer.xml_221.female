I wish things were so simple. But things will never be simple, and wishing wont get me very far. Sometimes I just feel so hopeless. But I try to keep in mind that there's always hope for the future.   *~Smile for the day that lies ahead, and give hope that tomorrow will come with good intentions. Value the days when laughter filled the air, and the sky cast it's vast beauty amongst the Earth from end to end. Desire to touch your childhood memories, and wish to grasp a tranquil summer's eve.  Remember your love of the past, give hope for the future, and the present will be of little worry. ~*   Something I always like to keep in mind. I wrote it a long time ago, but I like to read it whenever things get crazy. There's something about that last sentence that always offers the little bit of hope I'm needing.  Just found something else in My Documents that goes hand in hand with the above quote:  *~The odds are against me but I force on through troubled waters.  I pray that fate will be a gentle guide down the river of my life, so interrupted by the crashing waves of a violent storm.  But I know that every storm will break, and that a rainbow will pierce through the darkened clouds.  The ocean is a cycle; tide to tide, dawn to dusk.  All bad will fade, and all good will prevail in the end.  So as the winds fiercely rip at my heart, and the tears drench my tired face, I hold my head high, keep my eyes toward the sky and wait for that tiny gleam of sunlight to shine through the clouds.  Hope is infallible.~*  Well, have a nice day crazies.
