This means they only get a Thurs. and Fri. off. I operate the studio on the school system schedule so without the full spring break I can not go to California when I had planned. I am VERY disappointed! I had really fun and important stuff planned. :( This is very sad in the world of me. If you have any brilliant ideas, let me know...
