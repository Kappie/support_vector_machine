I fell during the curtain call tonight. I am so happy that happened then. I've been waiting for that for the past 3 shows we've done this year. Finally some relief. Hehehe. It was a GREAT fall too. I finally stole the scene, hehehe. Nah, I think I was just so exhausted that my knees buckled, because it was strangely not my dress's fault. Oh well, it was fun. The show didnt go as bad as I expected it go. It was pretty decent for a second night show. There were a few music problems, but we made some good saves. Props were flying everywhere and getting left as well. I'm just glad I survived tonight. What am I saying?!? I'm glad I survive every night I'm ever in a show. This one especially because the company's on stage the entire time. Yeah, we went to Sonic afterwards. That was fun. I felt bad like I was leaving Lisa, Emily, Laura, and Lacy out. Joseph is super funny. When he dropped me off at my house he saw the three raccoons that live in my garage and he got a golf club to beat the crap out of them, but they disappeared. He said he'd come back and beat the shit out of them. That was hilarious. I would have laughed my ass off if one of them would have come and bit him in the face. But yeah, I dont feel like writing anymore. I think I'm going to go dance to Baby Got Back.
