I was randomly searching through Blogger trying to find my buddies blog, and I found this guy's from Indianapolis' blog.  Which is really cool come to find out.  Well... I finally got the guts to speak to him, his name is Aaron by the way.  And he is pretty cool and we seem to have some stuff in common.  Which is awesome!!! Well... onto mess with the computer some more...
