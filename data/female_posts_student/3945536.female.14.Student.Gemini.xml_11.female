Anyways...It would be better in a PERSONAL laptop, really personal would be so much better since this is just like my diary...full of stuff i would'nt want just anyone to read. And, it's supposed to be easy to access...you know, just whenever i like to type in my emotions without any hassle.  --->Larisse's 9th Personal Logs 9:39 PM 3/5/2004  umm...still no damn cable! And if that cable problem isn't fixed by Sunday (the day Enterprise is gonna show it's 2 hour series opener...)...damn it!..They're gonna put back the old satellite thing...less channels...no star movies...wala pang mga couch, eclipse,wowow and fox japan, DAMN!!

I mean...*sigh* alam ko na...i'm just gonna be contented with this phone, until i get a new one...(I dunno if i ever gonna get one...)...Bakit ganito ba buhay? oh well, privilaged naman ako na may lots of stuff ako na la naman ung iba...ewan ko ba.And plus i have a great family...loving mother...a father na...minsan nantutuus...madaling magalit...ewan...pero binibili nya kaya ko nang Star Trek Communicator...haha...i dunno...  i'm probably feeling down today...kasi nga sa cable problem nayan...di ko pa napanood nang ayus yung Enterprise "Acquisition"...cute pa naman ung episode nayun...sa Sunday may christening thing naaatendan si Mommy and Papa, iwan lang kami sa bahay! yes!!A couple of hours freedom (well, i'm free naman if my folks are here naman...iba lang pagmagisa ka sa haus or whatever...) and i would LIKE TO VERY MUCH WANT (watta term?!) to watch Enterprise 2 hour opener in Star World!Pagyan ha....ung cable...ay!!nabibwisit na ko...whenever there's a perfect time to watch a show, they will be interrupting and make things worse...mina peeked in this part...ano ba...minute of privacy please?? hay...

I can watch Enterprise later at 9 pm =P  I dunno why I'm watching Lord of the Rings:The two Towers right now...?I must really hate it for me saying and writing this =0 haha...Mommy and Papa are in the Christening of Samantha Maryll...And We're all alone...once again...yeah! we can do anything we want...watch DVDs and stuff...:)  Anyway, I've just watched The Godfather Parts I and II! It was good! Real good! Maunday...Tuewsday...haha =) Now I want to read the book itself...BTW, when Al Pacino was young...he was real cute...*heehee* now I'm not wondering why my Mommy had a crush on him =)I like him when he was YOUNG (Of course not right now, he's old...)and Robert De Niro's performance was good, very good as young Vito Carleone....Michael Carleone's cute =*)  END 4:11 PM 3/7/2004  --->Larisse's 11th Personal Logs 10:08 PM 3/11/2004  Well, I just can't believe I have Season 3 DVD's of Friends and Season 2 DVD's of CSI!! (well, pirated of course! although there's no difference!=) Thank you so much Lord! Did I really deserve that?! Thank you soooo much!!! And to tell you I am beggining to become an avid fan of both series! Now, I've expanded!! From Sci-fi to Comedy to Drama (not so much drama...but "Forensic Science Drama") =) I am sooo super addicted to these 3 shows!! Jeanne texted me and she said that she was in Ruins right now and she told me she saw CSI and Friends DVD's! She asked me if I wanted the sets, of course I'd like it! I'd even LOVE it!! =) Now, I can watch CSI and Friends anytime now, now that I'm on a 9-day graduating vacation!  I did all the dishes this night, and I don't like to brag to Mommy or Papa or Mina that "I washed the dishes tonight!"!!...Well, I just felt good that I could help them! Mommy has a terrible stiff-neck, Papa has a cut...me...umm...i have a "hang-nail syndrome" that bleeds..haha Ü  *sigh*...I'm listening to the Enterprise theme by Russel Watson right now!!...Thank God! I can watch Enterprise on Star World too! "Don't ya think aliens can be sexier?"--Star World!! =) Faith of the Heart...I've got strength of the soul..I can reach any star...Faith of the Heart!! *oh yeah!* Rockem' up baby!! ;)  END 10:20 PM 3/11/2004  --->Larisse's 12th Personal Logs 10:24 PM 3/11/2004  BTW, continuation to! Kanina pala we were "celphone-watching"! I really do hope my folks will give me a brand new phone for my graduation gift! They were asking me kanina eh! ;)  END 10:25 PM 3/11/2004  --->Larisse's 13th Personal Logs 11:56 AM 3/14/2004  ummm....Ninong Boyet (i think...) called up Papa awhile ago and they were talking about cellphones...*sigh*...oh how I wish...I mean, I've done all I can to be a good girl and daughter...I think I really deserve something...I washed the dishes (whole lot of them) and I'm not doing that to get a phone or what (well, partly..hehe)...  My favorite Friends Episode:The one with The Football! It was soooo cool! Geller league!!Geller Cup! Oh yeah!  END 12:06 PM 3/14/2004  --->Larisse's 15th Personal Logs 11:00 PM 3/30/2004  Sheesh..it's been almost half a month since I last logged in here...Well, the recent events are some of the reasons why I wasn't able ta'! Here's the "recent events" since March 17 (last day I logged here):  1)March 19- "Back-to-school" because of the batch recollection  2)March 21- Well, the "most-awaited" grad ball came...partied from 6 till 12...  3)March 22-24 even though we stayed up till 12 last night, we still had to go to half-day practices for the graduation till the 24th.  4)March 25- practice for the baccalaureate mass.For a change of scenery, we were'nt practicing in the CPA anymore *whew 3 straight days practicing!*but my worries aren't over yet.A half-day practice for the mass in St. James and another half-day practice in CPA for the Graduation (that makes 1/2 day +1/2 day=1 whole day *groan*..) but i think the practices will pay off, because i really need to thank God for the enormous blessings I have garnered throughout the last year of my elementary life *dramatic...eh?* (some of these blessings were my being Top 8 and being seated on stage throughout the whole graduation proper!)  5)March 26- Graduating Batch's Baccalaureate Mass. Everything went smooth so far!  6)March 27- Graduation Proper (Gives me a reason to be happy because we graduated grade school with flying colors, but also gives me a reason to be terrified...why? High school life starts to kick in...that's why...(sheesh..more of no-ending projects and exams...:[ *groan*). Stayed seated on stage for the whole graduation. Mama Belle was there and Mark and Nice.  6)The same day, Max restaurant- We ate. Uncle Randy and co. was late, but we waited for them to come and they ate.  7)After that (well, still the same day...hehe)- Went malling with the peeps...(in my Graduation Gala attire..can you believe that?)...specifically KuyaS Jake and Mark. The two "alaskadors" (because they tease me that I have a RED nose..:{) hehe...and me went to Puyat's to go Billiards...Played Killer...lost...9-ball...2 shots later...WON...(first shot- I shoot the 1, 2nd shot- i hit the 2 and shoot the 9! Instant win against Kuya Mark!*Oh yeah!*)!!!:)  Bottomline:The day was complete! Now with my "most coveted diploma" (well, according to Steph's valedictory speech...)...Speaking of Steph...did ya know that Kuya Mark has now got a CRUSH on her?!!! *Whoa!*...woopsies..;)  ...Fast-forward to NOW....I'm still here (not the song...hehe...)..reading CSI fanfic AGAIN...:) AND writing here!!  BTW, no more cable...just the satellite...X[  END 11:48 PM 3/30/2004  ---->Larisse's 16th Personal Logs 1:15 AM 4/5/2004  oooh...it's really late...ughh...disconnected internet...bugs me!

And im totally sane for Mr.Eric Szmanda/a.k.a Greg Sanders!  Anyways, fanfiction:I really got inspired to write a fic when i heard Joe's I wanna Know in the mp3..it was so romantic, reminds me of Cath/Gil Shippers :)oh well...found new (not actually new, been there for like a month and a half!) friends in CSIguide.com naming:Rosie, Butterfinger, Anne and specially Lean!!they are so CSI'ers!
