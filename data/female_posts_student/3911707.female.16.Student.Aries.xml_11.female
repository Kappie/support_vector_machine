Pat told me that he did infact, talk to his mom about me. And supposibly, she talked to his dad. I'm not sure if he's just saying that to make me feel better or if he actually did. I doubt a lot of what he tells me, but why shouldn't I? I mean, he's lied so many times to me, and he talks behind my back (I don't think he realizes that I know that). Friday, after getting extremely pissed off, I drove off to Tasha's place. We sat down and talked to calm me down, and without me even having to say anything, she proved that he was lying to me about something. Not only that, but she mentioned how she didn't get him. Behind my back he complains about me and bitches and moans and talks shit. When I'm around him, it's different. Fuckin cool. I went back to talk to him after leaving her place, and after denying it for awhile, he finally admitted to lying about drinking. He knows what I feel about that kind of stuff. Though, the next night he did call and tell me he was going to be drinking. I give him props for that, at least. I'm so stressed out about this shit. I want there to be more with us.. and for some reason I'm really afraid that I'm going to lose him soon. Matt comes home in a month... I'll probably see him...uh, NEVER. It's not bad enough that I've always been last on the "important people" list of his. I've always been second to Jereme... and well, everyone else. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against his friends, mostly Matt (infact, I miss that kid, he was a great friend)... but I feel so unworthy. So many people tell me I could get better, but it tends to go in one ear and out the other. I know I could be treated better, believe me... but I don't know. Something must be wrong with me. I was just thinking about how I've never given the address out for this damn thing. Maybe I'm afraid to show people I know what I'm really thinking. Sometimes my thoughts can be really harsh, and sometimes I'm just too honest. I'm afraid of hurting someone. Maybe I'll give someone the address sometime. Doubtful though. I just realized that I'm talking to myself though. Oh well, sometimes you just have to let it all out. In that case. MOTHERFUCKER, CUNT, ASS, FAGGOT, DUMBASS, BUTTFUCKER, ASSLICKER, LA LA LA LA LA LA. My life sucks. No, really. Look at me. I'm slowly losing all of my friends, I drive a fucking van, have no job, my family is constantly pissed at me or treating me like shit, I don't have a boyfriend, I'm not loved by that many, I'm sitting here writing in this fucking thing... ugh. I just want to drink myself gone right now... and I'm seriously considering it. Might as well, no one's going to miss me. And if they do, they'll forget me sooner or later. Oh how fucking sad that I'm feeling so damn sorry for myself. I just want to move away and become... someone else. Or just start my life over, because I really hate all of this. If it makes you feel any better (uh, yeah, I'm talking to myself here), at least I'm not the one who ended up pregnant. I just want to be loved.
