I was diagnosed with a condition called high-grade cervical dysplasia a few months ago.  An abnormal result came back with my last PAP test in December.  I found out the day that Brent was rushed to the ER from work with kidney stones.  I believe that it got pushed to the back-burner for a long time.  But now, here it is, live and in color for me to deal with (read: freak out about.)  Now this isn't to say that any of my readers should freak out, oh no.  This is just me being insane.  Because truly I have nothing to worry about.  My doctor is capable, even if his receptionist is a biatch.  The procedure will be brief, and then all I need to look forward to is a couple of years of regular (yeah, every three months!) pelvic exams.  So yeah, I am kind of freaking out about this surgery.  I guess because it seemed so far away until this week.  I honestly haven't given it very much thought at all.  All week long, it keeps popping into my head, and I get these horrible anxious pangs of fear in my chest that make me a little dizzy.  I'll be fine, I'm sure, I just want to get it all over with.  I've just got these horrible psycho-somatic pains now.  When I had to delay my appt a few weeks ago, the receptionist said "you can't keep doing this, you know.  You don't want to get sick."  Can you tell that the words of that stupid ninny of a woman have stuck with me?  Like what the fuck do you know, lady, that I don't???  Errgh.  I feel like my body has betrayed me. I feel like I've been invaded by some foreign entity that's got some vendetta to wage against me. I have nightmares of watching my uterus being eaten whole by a merciless army of ants.  What's the worst case scenario?  A friend asked me this the other day, when I just sorta sprung the news on him ( Oh, by the way, if I seem a little weird next week, don't worry, it's just that I've had surgery on one of my most important parts.  Aha. )  Worst case: infertility, proneness to cancer later in life.  You know, no biggie.  I think he was really hoping to hear that there would be no major reprecussions so that he could reassure me.  When that avenue failed, he just gave me an "Oh,"  Yup, it really is as sucky as it sounds.  Now I'm just being dramatic.  How's this for being dramatic?  I've decided that celibacy will be my best course of action for the next couple of... months?  I'm not sure how long.  At least until I've recovered (I am notorious for never giving myself enough time to recover from anything,) and after that, if it still seems like a viable option, who knows.  It will certainly filter out who's for real and who's not, insofar as the b/f's-in-waiting (as my parents love to call them) will need to figure out what the heck it is they think I can offer.  And of course, the rest of that is a matter for another blog, methinks...
