I feel so bad because my sister is so sick. Its not really a good thing to be sick when you're pregnant. So we are all a bit worried. She hasnt been to work in 3 days and she cant keep any food in her system. I feel so bad for her. I just hope that she gets better before the baby is born otherwise the baby will be sick when she's born. That wouldnt be a good thing. I hope she gets better!!   Oh and I was kind of mean in my past entry. I'm sorry. I didnt mean to come off as a bitch. I just wanted to get across the idea that I'm over it... Completely and totally over it.   Anyways... I am super pumped for tonight!! its going to be a blast. Well I just now remember that I have to go to my dad's tonight... SHIT!!! I dont want to go!!! I just wanted to jump around my house all day. GRRR!!! now I have to deal with showering and getting dressed and all the bullshit stuff that I didnt want to do until later. GRRR...   adios   -Gabby
