(humph~!!)  gt stuck and went to my grand ma hs.. (stupid~!)  a poem for my dearest melvin,  If I knew it would be the last time  I'd see you fall asleep, I would tuck  you in more tightly and pray the Lord  your soul to keep.   If I knew it would be the last time  I'd see you walk out the door I would hug you and kiss you and call you  back for one more.   If I knew it would be the last time  I heard your name lifted up in praise I would video tape each action and word  so I could play it back for days.   If I knew it would be the last time to  spare an extra minute or two with you  I'd stop and say, "I love you"  Instead of assuming that you know I do.   If I knew it would be the last time  I would be there to share your day...  well, I'm sure you'll have many more,  So, I'll let this one slip away.   For surely there is tomorrow  to make up for an oversight  and we'll always get a second chance  to make everything alright.   There will be another chance  to say our I love you's  and certainly there's another chance  to say our anything I can do's.   But just in case I might be wrong  and today is all I get I'd like to say how much I love you  and hope we never forget.   Tomorrow is not promised to anyone  young or old alike  and today might be your last chance  to hold  your loved one tight.   So if you're waiting for tomorrow  why not do it all today?  For if tomorrow never comes  you will surely regret the day   you didn't take the extra time  for a smile, or hug, or kiss  and you were too busy to grant someone  what turned out to be their last wish.   So hold your loved ones close today  and whisper in their ear  Telling them how much you love them  and that you'll always hold them dear.   Take the time to say, "I'm sorry"  "Please forgive me," "Thank you, or, It's okay"  And if tomorrow never comes  you'll have no regrets about today.
