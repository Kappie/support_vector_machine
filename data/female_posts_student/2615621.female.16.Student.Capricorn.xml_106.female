We spent the nite and gossiped and just did stupid lil girl things. Then i learned she was a backstabbing bitch. lmao WELL...9th grade came along some odd years later and we were "civil". I think she learned that some friends were true friends (like me) and others were fake (the popular kids she idolized) so we could sometimes chat, go to the mall and of course walmart. Well, this summer shes been extra sweet to me and we talk all the time, and she tells me when i get home we're gonna have to hang out some and how i need to call her while im in tenn. and all this stuff. im actually talkin to her right now. And im like.."why all the sudden is she acting like my best friend when we havent been real good friends in years" umm..oh well. I'm nice and u know, maybe rebuilding a friendship with her isnt all that bad. It could be worse..like catherine wood! hahaha Anyways, ive decided its either cuz shes dating this hot new dude and wants to brag or shes honestly intrested in talking. hmm only time will tell.   i was updating my yahoo profile last nite and came up with the cutest quote!!  "u'll never know how much you mean to someone unless you let them know how much they mean to u" AWW isnt that sweet?! and i made that up!! haha  *much love* ~keep ur fingers crossed for me and danny~
