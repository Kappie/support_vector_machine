But yesterday was not a good day... so i don't think I will coment on it... it made me very very very angry.  However, there were a few highlights... MK has at least 3 sisters and Adam's name is Alfred, that was it.  Today was a bad morning as well... horribly bad, unfathomably bad, but i lived.  There was a religion debate in Lit and Comp today (the world needs to grow up).
