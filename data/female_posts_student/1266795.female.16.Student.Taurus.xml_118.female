Today was my first official DCM. One person came. I remember sitting there at 1:15, thinking: "I hope someone's late and is still planning to come. I feel like a fool standing up by myself in the Glendale Mall Food Court, watching the people who come through the doors." Then Danielle came, and I was happy. Ah, well. More cupcakes for Amaris!  After that, I rushed over to Ruby Tuesday's to have lunch with Ash and her father. (I still think he doesn't exactly like me all that well, Ash. I don't get along well with Gemini men, unfortunately. Pooie. There are some nice ones out there.) We talked for about an hour and 45 minutes, which I found incredibly interesting. (Yes, I know, I'm using astrological psychology in my observations, but when there's a Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer present, you're bound to have an entertaining time.)  Then Ash came over, and we talked. WOOHOO! And she's coming with me to see relatives in Kokomo tomorrow! (Can you say,  shopping with my aunt and uncle ?)   And the countdown continues... (Right, Ash?)  "Shall we go to bed?"
