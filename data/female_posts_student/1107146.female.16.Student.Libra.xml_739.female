Yesterday I was coughing and I spit blood, which wasn't very fun (and yes Linds, Abby knows), and that wasn't too cool. And I'm just having a chemical imbalance in general from being sick. God I hate feeling this way. It's like being in a box full of rusty razors with no way out, ever.   Cough cough. That's why, right thurr. Fuck. I have stuff to go do. I just thought I would check and see how everyone else is doing.
