This time it is something simple enough for me to remember. I was very relieved to have finally get a hold of a live being, I was afraid I would have to listen to the “All operators are busy at this time, your call will be answered in the order in which it was received”  “please stay on the line, your patience is appreciated” for another ½ hour or so… I think I devoted an hour of my free time listening to those two messages. It just about drove me mad.   In other news, Jesse and I have attempted to talk every day online. Jesse thinks that this is the most stable means of communication, at least until he gets another number to call home on, the one he is using right now connects out of Germany and they time our calls, 15 minutes and no more. Also there is a delay on the phone and it gets a little annoying as well, but I can deal with the annoyance if it means I get to talk to Jesse.   Jesse sent me a picture of his current sleeping area and it seems small but Jesse assured me that it’s comfortable.    urlLink
