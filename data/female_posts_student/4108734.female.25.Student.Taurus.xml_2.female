One of the posts on her weblog has a list of  170  accountability questions - that's right  170 .  I thought it would be fun to answer a few of them and see what people have to say in response, or even what their own answers are.    Here's the first one that caught my eye..."Have you conducted a spiritual fast within the past month?"  If that's not convicting, I don't know what is.  My answer to this question is yes, but it's not a wholehearted yes.  I have fasted once in the last month, from food.  (You can also fast other things, like TV, movies, video games - something that takes up your time and energybut that you could live without, and to do so would constitute a sacrifice for you - maybe it's even an addiction for you.)  But I feel like the question should be "Have you conducted a spiritual fast within the past week?"  When Jesus is talking to the disciples about fasting, which He does quite frequently, especially in the book of Matthew, particularly in chapter 6, He says " when  you fast..."  He doesn't say " if  you fast..."  He says WHEN.  My heart is convicted.  It's not a question of how convenient it is for me to not eat that day because people might look at me like I have an eating disorder, or telling people I can't go to a movie with them because I'm not watching movies for a month.  It's a question of how much does my heart want to be devoted to the LORD?  How much do I want to be obedient to Him so that I can walk in truth and light and life?    Well, my friend Keri is here for a late night trip to Walmart, so I'll answer some more of the questions later...feel free to comment or discuss your own answer.  Peace!
