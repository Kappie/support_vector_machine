Okay, now that that is said, I must say that it has come to my attention that there are those who would judge us by our pass times of all things.  There are so many other things we could be judged for; our pass-times should be our own!  It has come to my attention that some people would go so far as to blame gaming and games such as Dungeons  Dragons for all sorts of terrible deeds.  If a gamer kills themselves, it’s automatically the work of the devil through the use of D, what a crock of shit!  Excuse my French – pardon the expression.  Dungeons and Dragons is a game, books, paper, and dice, not some gate to the underworld.    Now I must say that we have all heard of those who get a bit carried away in the game and jump from rooftops thinking that they can fly, and terrible things like that.  When we hear of these nut cases we cringe as a whole, all gamers cringe as one.  Every single time one of these stories get out to the public, it makes all of us gamers look crazy!  The truth of the matter is that we are pretty sane, all in all.  Crazy people can golf, that doesn’t make the golf green the devil’s den!  Of course not!  So I have referenced a few website’s that are good to read on this topic:   urlLink Paul Cardwell, Jr. Chair of the Committee for the Advancement of Role-Playing Games (CAR-PGa), an international network researching all aspects of role-playing games.      urlLink A parent’s guide to Role Playing Games.
