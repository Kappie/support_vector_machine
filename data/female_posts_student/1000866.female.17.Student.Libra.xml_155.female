It was a pretty normal day, but I'm so de-stressed right now, and so happy...it seemed like an excellent day. OK, so, hm. I got a Tiki hat from Matthew!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was SO excited when he told me I could keep it. Ah, happiness. :)Wind Ensemble, or...Study Hall now...was really good. I just hung out with Kelly and Kristen the whole period. YaY! I wish I would have had my yearbook so people could sign it. Oh well, I'll get people to tomorrow. So, we just goofed off all period. It was cool.  Music Theory, we actually learned gosh darnit. I loathe learning in that class. Oh well, it was boring boring boring. Chemistry, we didn't tye-dye shirts, grrr! It was too rainy and whatnot too. They said maybe tomorrow, so we just did worksheets and book problems and stuff. I never get anything done when I work with Diane though. I always want to talk to her. :)   Hmmm, Health was ok, and yet COMPLETELY DISGUSTING. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my GOSH! The way that class is teaching me, I'll never ever want to have sex...EVER. Oh jeez....we talked about pubic lice, and EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!! OH MY GOODNESS! It was just...so terrible Grody grody grody.  Then speech, I did it. I did my final speech. It certainly wasn't my best speech, but it was alright. I'm glad I got it over with at least. I'm going to miss Will. He's such an amazing kid. I just, really like him. I think he's a great person.  Lunch was good. We just sort of signed yearbooks. I didn't really eat much of my lunch. I've decided to not just sign anyone's yearbook this year. I've decided to write a personal message to everyone about something I like about them, or something I remember from this year. Yearbook signings make me sad. I know a lot of Juniors they'll be seniors next year, and I'm going to lose a LOT of my friends. Man, isn't losing Joanne enough?? I'm really going to miss Joanne. I really feel I can trust her, and talk to her about anything, and if I didn't want her to tell...she wouldn't. I can be myself around her. I can be goofy with her. Man, I'm going to spend as much time with her as possible this summer. I've sort of been...distanceing myself from her this year I think. Gosh, why didn't I realize this before???? ARGH!!!! I'm so so mad at myself. I don't want to lose her. I think if I don't spend as much time with her before she goes...I wont miss her as much. I can't believe I didn't realize this before now. I hate losing people though. And then all my junior friends will leave next year, and I'll probably cry, and make a fool of myself. I mean, yearbook time always makes me think... I've only got two years left, and the first two I've had have gone by so fast. SO FAST! I don't know...I'm scared to go on from High School. I'm so secure and content. I'm really excited too though. I feel like I'll fit in better with an adult world, but...maybe not. Maybe I'm just fooling myself into thinking that.   Oh yeah....my day. Ha. Kind of funny. I need to stop thinking. I'm de-stressed, and I'm stressing myself out again. STOP CATIE!!!   Math was ok. We took a quiz. I think I did ok. After that everyone just signed yearbooks, but I don't really know anyone in my math class so I just did the review packet. Yeah, I'm a loser. Oh well. I got one person to sign it. :) Then government we just kept watching 12 Angry Men. It's a pretty good movie. Hm, and after school, we avoided the beast/stalker. Man, that kid is such a stalker. Stalker man, Stalker man, does whatever a stalker can. Unfortunately...I'm afraid that *girl* will give in to stalker man. I'm worried about her.   I'm worried about everything. A very wise person told me once to just....stop worrying. I tried it once, and realized that I was worrying about not worrying in case someone thought I was a jerk for not worrying. Man am I a loser. Heh, I was afraid to get the person I liked last year to sign my yearbook. I'm not going to be that way this year! HMPH! I'm strong. I'm brave! I'm the Brown Crayon!!! *Dramatic music plays*  Wow...I really need to stop writing. You know...I wonder if anyone reads this. I doubt it. I guess I don't know if I want people to read it anyway, it's sort of for me. I did start it out as a fun public thing, but...I'm writing more and more now...  :)
