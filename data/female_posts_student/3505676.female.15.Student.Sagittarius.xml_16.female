Whether we're out and about or just sitting at home listening to music [[shaking, she's shaking up]] we have a blast! Plus i dont get sick of my chris! *haha* Went to the pool with Dan and Sean this afternoon for a little bit, then cookout and goodberrys.  They left later and Christine and I just hung out some more, she even ate TOFU! *haha* and i have a PICTURE to prove it! Unfortunately, she left at 7! So now its just me and my mom again! I wanted to go see a play tonight but im exhausted, prolly heading to bed at 9, maybe earlier.
