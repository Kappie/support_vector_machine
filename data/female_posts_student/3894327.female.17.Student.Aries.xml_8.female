It is depressing, sad, dark and many other things, but so far I think it's pretty good. The hardest part so far is to define the characters and keep them consistent. It is also hard for me to make the words flow. My writing style tends to get choppy. No worries though, I shall prevail. On the other hand I have 1000 words, which for me is a lot for the little amount of time I've had. I also think that the opening bit is really good. I think I conveyed the girl's emotions well. So I'm doing alright.   I realize no one comes to this blog yet, but I  kind of enjoy talking to nobody, so I'll keep going.   -Driel
