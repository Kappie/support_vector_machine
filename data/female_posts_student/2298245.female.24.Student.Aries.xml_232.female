This article calls the increase the largest in 20 years.  The article also notes that this is surprising, to say the least.  But maybe it isn't that difficult to believe after all.  If you ever read  urlLink Andrew Sullivan , (and if you don't I'll keep saying it - you should) you'll know that the conservative fear of spending has actually seemed to elude the younger Bush.  So we'll just add this to the list of more money that the administration wants to spent.  It is, however, strange that the administration wants to spend it at all.  The article above seems to attribute this somewhat to the influence of Laura Bush, and the concept of a First Lady being the cause of policy initiatives is not anything new.  I have no idea what the cause, but I do find it somewhat ironic that the largest increase in the budget of the NEA should come under a  Republican  president, in particular  this  Republican president, who has probably engendered more hatred among those in the artistic communities than any other, which the possible exception of Ronald Reagan.  Not that this is likely to change any of that...for the complaints will still come that, despite the increase, the arts budget is pitifully low.  Which I suppose is true enough.  But still, it would seem to be that a small step in the right direction is something to praise, not criticize, and this is something that could be readily admitted to by those on the left without signing on kit-and-kaboodle to the whole of Bush's policies.    But that's just my 2 cents...though it's probably worth less than that even.
