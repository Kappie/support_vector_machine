All I can say is thank god for Bill Walsh... don't know what I would do without him :) This week has gone SO MUCH BETTER than last, except for that whole sleeping in too late thing yesterday, but I have already been forgiven of that... thank god. All I need now to make this week perfect is for a massive snow storm to hit tomorrow, resulting in NO WORK on Friday... but we all know that I was lucky to have gotten one day called off earlier this winter, guess I can't ask for much more. RIght? Oh well. By the way, I hear they are cracking down on music file sharing again... BIG SHOCKER!!! So for those of you out there... beware! By the way, just bought the highlights from the new cast of La Boheme on Broadway... they all rock... Go check it out! But I am warning you, it's all Italian and it's all opera... Here's the link: Baz Luhrman's La Boheme Well time to go hang out with the roommate...
