So that was 2nd time. and then..for the 3rd time...he told me how i shouldnt have left the school property at lunch tuesday without permission because he could get in HUGE trouble!!! so i dont know how that went, and tomorrow i havea huge math exam. it doesnt count, but the smartest girl in the other class said it was super hard. so isnt that just stellar! okay im so slacking this term, id be VERY suprised if i got an 80 average. i still hope i graduate with honours though...ahhh! i cant wait for school to be OVER!!! next week is Ottawa, i hope its fun...although msot schools get to go to freakin QUEBEC! which is probably loads better. dah well what can you do. my eye is messed up. i realized it was sort of hurting yesterday, and i woke up this morning and my flippin eyelid was swollen! it was sick! i dont know whats wrong with it. zohal thinks that a fly flew up in there and now its laying eggs. ICK! yep and my ankle is hurting again..im such a wrek, and a complainer but i cant help it everything is wrong with me ha ha. well i should go. toodles!
