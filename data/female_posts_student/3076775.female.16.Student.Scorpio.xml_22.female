This started happening about Friday, so I didn't get a chance to post Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. It sucks,I know. I mean, I'm sure that everyone is obscenely interested in my life. You all are probably having withdrawal from not being able to see what's been going on in my life lately. So.......let's start with Friday then to catch up, shall we?         Friday: The first words out of my mouth were "OH CRAP!" You'd think that this would be a sign of a terrible day, but it was really good, after the yardsale.......Yardsaling mania!!!!!!!!!! WOOHOO!!!!!!!!(not really woohoo, but we'll pretend I had fun) Anywho, that was about 5 hours out of my life. I made $40!!!! Not a total loss, eh? After that, my mom came and picked me up, and we went to Rosie's Cantina and ate lunch. Then, we went and I got my hair highlighted!!! It's got almost platinum blond streaks in it now! It's so cute...I'm proud of it. lol! Ahem...after that, we came home, I called Chelsea, and she told me that there was some girlscout thingy at the pottery place. So, we went there. I painted a penguin!!!!! It's so cute! I get to see the finished product by next Monday. Some guy named Cameron kept flirting with Chelsea and me at that place, but other than that it was fun. OOh, and after that we went to the little fair in Huntsville in front of Books-A-Million. We rode the Ring of Fire.......IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!! I LOVE ROLLER COASTERS!!!!!!!! Chelsea was acting like she was scared stiff, but I bet she loved it too. lol.            Saturday: IT WAS SO FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, well, before my DDR Party it was a little boring, but once Chelsea arrived, the whole evening and night was awesome!!!!! Nick came over, so that made it worlds better. I don't think I'd have enjoyed the evening as much without him there. *sigh* lol, anywho.....okay okay, I'll tell ya, I got kissed!!!! *blushes* I'm a terrible kisser, but ah well. Zach saw us, and he freaked out like you wouldn't believe, but I suppose it doesnt' matter.             Sunday: Sunday was pretty nice, I suppose. We went to Wal Mart (me and chelsea did) after church was over. It was pretty fun. Chelsea got her hair cut!!!! IT'S SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^_^ She got about 5 inches cut off. While she was getting it done, I fell asleep in my chair..And for some odd reason, I was rudely awakened by SOMEONE(you know who you are.........CHELSEA!) clapping in my face really loud! It scared me so bad. I think I'll need therapy for it. After we got back from WalMart, I didn't do too much. I called Nick and talked to him for a while, then I called Chelsea and talked to her for an even longer while. We're planning out our exercise program. I can't wait to get started! YAY!!!!!!!!!!             Today: TODAY WAS WONDERFUL! I got to go back to school and see all my friends. Well, not ALL of em, but most of em. Adrienne started asking questions about me and Nick today....which was interesting, to say the least. lol. Amy doesn't approve of him, but ah well, she'll just have to get over it. Hehe, Chelsea told me that Amy could kiss my @$$ and get over it. (those were my thoughts exactly, too) Anywho, I think I've written quite enough for the moment. See ya all laterz.
