It's sleek, sexy, and best of all... it's backlit! The cool, blue glow from within will help reduce eyestrain andglare from overhead lights. And, besides, it's really cool. (Did Isay that already?) If you've upgraded your PC's tower to something clear with neon lighting, then this is the perfect addition to your complement of gear. You gotta admit, it's a bright idea!
