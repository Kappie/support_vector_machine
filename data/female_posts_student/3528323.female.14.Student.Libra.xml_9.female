Every 20 minutes I have to put frozen peas on his face and then in another 20 minutes I have to take them off....I have to repeat that until 5:00 tonite!! My grandma was over earlier tho while my mama was at work and we took care of him...she is making a grandmother book for my cousin Patrick who lives in Minnesota and is graduating at the end of June (in the fall he is coming to Stanford)...but anyways I was helping her with that which was pretty fun!! Then randomly she gave me a lot of money....she said it was for my awards!! Wow I feel special!   At 3:30 I have to go over to good ol' SM to meet Sister Colette...she gave me a scholarship so I have to go meet her...not too excited but I'll do it!! Then at 4:00 I'm off to bball :-/ Oh well!!! Im still not feeling too good...I think I just have a cold but hey it's a good excuse to get out of the running!! hahaha!! I wish!!!
