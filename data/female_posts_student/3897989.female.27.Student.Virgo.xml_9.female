So much has happened in the past few days. My home improvement project has begun. I'm planning on painting the walls satin white and decorating Oriental style. I'm even planning to paint my waterbed white with oriental writing on it. I'm even going to paint the glass inserts on the headboard's side cabinets. I've turned the center into my bookshelf for all the reading material I've acquired. I've found a lot of reading on Eastern Philosophy and psychology.   I found a new water fountain today, copper with lights around each tube that water flows out of. I also found some oriental pillow covers with an endless knot and the jade eternity circles. Beautiful!! I feel such creative energy flowing. Passion and peace touch me, not sparing their essence.   I've also enjoyed my hands on class this past week. It still ceases to amaze me that my instructor never feels the need to guide me in my studies. He hovers over everyone else. From time to time I'll feel his eyes onlooking in approval and amazement. He's encouraged my working in the clinic. In turn that gives me strength.   My new job is quite amazing. Several people got hired the same day as I did. They all have one place only to work. Yet, they have cross-trained me in several areas, and Saturday my supervisor simply said, "I can trust you to move back and forth between departments and do what you need to do. Feel free to go where you feel you're needed. I know you know what you're doing and know you will work." Can we say, Oh Yeah!!   The VP of our company has since amazed me even more this week since my business suggestion and heartfelt story. I let him know that I was teaching myself a second language and he sent his encouragement a few days ago. But the kicker that really impressed me was even after he had done all that, two days later he sends his personal secretary down to the floor to deliver a card to me. It was ahandwritten thank you letter for embracing the Spanish community and that he intends to assist me in all my endeavors. Hmmmm. We have security cameras everywhere that the managers watch at their office and he has his in his office. I know he wanted to see me open it, but I waited and opened it on my way home. It's so flattering to have these occurrences in my life. I'm very thankful.   I have had many blessings in my life since my divorce. Everything is final and I'm very secure. Friends have flocked by my side and I've made many more new friends that I would have never been allowed to spend time with otherwise. I have a love to share with, no strings attached. My children are happy and are positively expressing themselves. Things are so alive in my eyes. Beauty is all around me, even in my most challenging moments.   May my life encourage others to free themselves from the bonds that stifle their creativity toward the culmination of their purpose. My purpose is to love freely, to live with passion, to have all I need, and share the rest. To enjoy the moon, to gaze beyond the stars, to embrace the one who equals me, to experience all that I have yet to live, and work until I move from this world doing what I love.   Peace,   BLG
