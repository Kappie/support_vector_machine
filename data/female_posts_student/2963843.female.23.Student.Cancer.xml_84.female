I had wanted to distance myself from this person, It wasn't anything personal but I was terrified of the possiblity of getting into another relationship. When he said he wanted to talk to me over the phone I gave some lame excuse of my mom using the phone... I ignored this person for days... Until he told me over the icq that his dad is in hospital...  I can't be so selfish.. He needs a friend now... He told me not many of his friends knew about this.. Seems like his guy friends are not supportive enough... I'm going over to see his dad tml after project at SGH...    keSAn (10:59 PM) : hi Janine¤ (10:59 PM) : how ur day? keSAn (11:00 PM) : tired.....i went hospital Janine¤ (11:00 PM) : what happened? r u ok keSAn (11:00 PM) : visist my dad Janine¤ (11:00 PM) : is he ok? keSAn (11:00 PM) : he got first stage canner keSAn (11:00 PM) : cancer keSAn (11:01 PM) : i did not let most of my friend know keSAn (11:01 PM) : not even hobbit Janine¤ (11:01 PM) : u must be strong keSAn (11:01 PM) : then after visit him...i go ball training Janine¤ (11:02 PM) : what type of cancer is it? keSAn (11:02 PM) : postial keSAn (11:02 PM) : near stomach Janine¤ (11:02 PM) : u should tell ur friends u know... dun keep it all inside...
