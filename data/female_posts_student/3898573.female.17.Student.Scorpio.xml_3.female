Not as different as I thought it would be, so I think that means we really were ready.  He chose a party last weekend over me.  But he had been givin me all his Saturdays and hadn't partied with his friends much, so it's cool I guess. I already have him for next Saturday, we're goin to the Midnight Showing of The Goonies at The Grandin.  That'll be fun.  I just really don't feel like posting right now.  This is the shortest one that I have ever wrote.  Oh, there are a couple points I need to get out of my system.  Derrick called the other day and I wanted to answer it and talk to him.  And I've noticed that see, I used to think Jacob was just the greatest guy all the time, when I was with him and when I wasn't , but I noticed lately, I feel like that when I'm with him, but when I'm not, he's just ok.  I dont' understand it.  I think I just need to be reminded from him of how good a guy he is.  He's been sayin I'm "squishy" and stuff like that a lot lately, and I know he's kidding or whatever, but it's just hard to hear that and think he's a great guy all the time.  My feelings will probably go back to normal soon.  We'll see.
