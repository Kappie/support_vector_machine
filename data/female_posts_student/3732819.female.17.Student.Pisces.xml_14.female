The conversations we had were a total blast!!! everything was funny...but you kinda had to be there. DJ! (lol Sabz) *legs twitch*, rubber chickens, the napkins,  straws....AH HAHAHAHAHAHA oh god...okay....yeah we were both laughing so hard we were crying! oh mercy...yes...then we got bored....and pretty every half hour we were like "k we're gunna go now" and then we just keep talking....and then FINALLY we go outside cause we were going to go...but then we ended up chilling outside for another hour and a bit. Mark started showing us moves on his skateboard....chased Sami around for a bit cause he kept trying to write stuff on my car....and then yeah....so mark went and started drawing  penises on his car and so i joined in and then sami started chasing me....so then mark tried drawing again...and sami tried to go for him but i blocked him...and he picked me up and moved me aside...and then yeah....started playing with the skateboard and yeah....i had so much fun i can't even describe it! I got a nice hug from Sami and Mark....so hopefully i get to talk to them again in the future. OH then another thing....me and sabz went to mcdonalds and i couldn't decide whether i watned a bear which came with the happy meal or the mcdeal (fish filet) so yeah...i came to the conlcusion that i watned the bear...and i asked the lady what kinda bears there were...and she brought out two and i kept one in my purse and stole the other one...NOW I HAVE TWO BEARS!
