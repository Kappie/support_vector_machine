I know, I know, one good day of not reading Lanie vent about pointless stuff. haha  Before I go on..please check this website out.   urlLink Bailey's AHA Webpage   He is doing so well with the help of people with HUGE hearts. In the past we have had so many good friends go out of their way to help us raise money by spreading the word to their own family, friends and co-workers. This is even more true today.  I know I have mentioned Riss before. She is a friend of a friend, but slowly via internet we have started a friendship. I enjoy her candid and insightful thoughts. She has two beautiful twin daughters and still manages to look amazing! But aside from that she has a HUGE heart and spread the word to her friends and now her very generous friends have made contributions. Sometimes we take things for granted in life, I know I have quite a few times, but I want to change that.  So Riss and all your wonderful friends...THANK YOU! (Please pass the thanks to your friends, Riss). And THANK YOU to all my friends who make donations year after year, Curie, Keiko, JoAnn, and of course Heidi... gosh if I missed you. THANK YOU!  I am so amazed by how wonderful people can be. I only wish that everyone else is as blessed as my family and I are when it comes to friends and family.  You guys have a good weekend. I don't know how much I will be on because today I have to clean for the in-laws. I look forward to seeing them and I know that Ed and the kids are overjoyed. =) You ALL ROCK! Thanks for being such great friends. I know I am in a funk a lot of times but thanks for staying patient with me.
