Clouds drift across the sky as we drift away and disappear no one will remember us anyways we'll slip into the (insert adjective here) surf completely unnoticed I'll swim among mermaids cling to dolphins and the only words you gave me I can only hope that they were true..  -Chorus- Lower the anchor hit the ocean floor strand us amid this abysmal blue with no escape  I sense the rocks beneath me in this deep blue dream slippery seaweed teases at my toes as I take in my surroundings I wonder, why you're not with me...  -Chorus-
