As I was driving down Mockingbird it amazed me as to how many people leave their shades open and have the lights on in their house.  Do they want people looking in at all their goods?  I could even see one guy sitting in his chair watching television!    This isn't so bad.  When I get to my building,  urlLink Mockingbird Station , you might as well stand outside and look into all the apartments to see all their goods.  It's a good thing I'm on such a high floor on the other side of the building!  I'm sure everyone still gets a peep show, but it's a nice false sense of security to think that I really do have privacy!  You should check out the site, you can actually view each of the floor plans.
