Alright, for the pure lack of anything to do or say, I've come up with a list of the 27 essential songs of all time, even though some of you might not agree with them (actually, if you have any suggested songs, tell me.) In any case, here they are, from the past 60 or so years, 27 of the greatest songs:  1. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana, (this is basically a bit unfair, and a somewhat over-milked song, but it was a defining moment in music history.) 2. "Fire" by Jimi Hendrix (Among many, this one, Purple Haze, and Stone Free stand out, so do way too many more) 3. "I Wanna be Your Dog" by The Stooges (The song that made them famous, followed by...) 4. "Gimme Danger" by Iggy  the Stooges (the song on the album that faded them out of exsistence, this song is widely known as a punk anthem) 5.  "Sunshine of Your Love" by Cream (Awesome song, amongst many more powerful hits by Cream) 6. "Blind" by KoRn (THE definition of KoRn's potential, sad they had to throw it all away) 7. "Imagine" by John Lennon (Communist brainwashing? A genius's vision for a perfect world? Whatever it was, there's no one out there who hasn't heard of it!) 8. "Iron Man" by Black Sabbath (appearing on the Album "Paranoid" everyone from NOFX to rap artist Busta Rhymes, or however you spell that...) 9. "Runaway" by Del Shannon (thought to be a one-hit wonder, this rocketed the young Del Shannon to stardom, but since he was know for just this song forever, and due to some other problems, he commited suicide!) 10. "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" by Leadbelly 11. "I Love Rock  Roll" by Joan Jett and the Sex Pistols 12. "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire" by the Ink Spots (highly influential Jazz group, with their share of troubles) 13. "Wherever I May Roam" by Metallica 14. "If I Think" by Mudhoney (The song that ties grunge together, as Kurt Cobain put it) 15. "Where is My Mind?" by The Pixies (This song, and the album it was on "Surfer Rosa" let the world know something big was comin', and they were right) 16. "Venus in Furs" by The Velvet Underground (This and the entire album its on "The Velvet Underground  Nico" was a shame for the group, since no one understood the cover, but after they gained fame, all of the entire album began selling like crazy) 17. "Return of the Rat" by The Wipers (The Wipers' first album "Is this Real?" and their step into histoy, covered by many famous artists all over) 18. "Turning Japanese" by The Vapors (You interpret this song however you like) 19. "She's the One" by The Ramones 20. "Kill Your Idols" by Sonic Youth 21. "Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison 22. "Crazy Train" by Ozzy Osbourne 23. "Clandestino" by Manu Chao (His first album [I think] since the break up of the band "La Mano Negra", and its not a disappointment) 24. "Sweet Child O' Mine" by Guns N' Roses 25. "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin 26. "Night Goat" by The Melvins 27. "Backwater" by The Meat Puppets  I'm Deadinside, this'll take up a lot of space...whoops...  "That's when you know, you're too asleep to care"
