So I go to the salon, tell the girl exactly what I wanted, (a new style that'll look good growing out) and what does she do?  She hacks 2 or so inches off of the front leaving me with hair so short that I can't even tuck it behind my ears.  It barely reaches my mouth it's so short.  And, did I mention that it looks like shit.  I've never been so upset about a hair cut before.  I honestly hate it.  It looks like a guys hair cut gone awry.  Yea, so not the look I was going for.  I'm gunna go now and try and salvage the remains of my hair.... my sweet, precious hair.... I'm going to cry again....
