I guess we're all empty souls in side because of our greed we always want more and more and even once we accomplish our goal its never enough for us. we strive for what we cant get. Always.   I think im beginning to realize what real friends are, and im beginning to see maybe way back when i really had no idea what a friend was, i just assumed i had them when mayeb i really never did. lifes like that
