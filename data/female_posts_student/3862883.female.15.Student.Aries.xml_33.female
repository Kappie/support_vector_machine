Description is particularly important in the setting because it tells you what the setting is like. It makes you feel and see the way the writer wants you to. In the book there were lots of very good descriptions in it, it went step be step which helped me to understand. It made me want to read it more and caught my attention. The way I felt was exactly what the book said and it was amazing because I never had such feeling like that through a book. It was one of the best stories I have ever read. Example: the desert contributed a lot to the story and I understood mostly everything. I could feel the heat from the sun and thirst Durante had through out the story.
