She left her 9 year old son home, and according to state law he can be alone for two hours. She returned home less than two hours later, and CPS had come and taken him from the home. No one knows why they did, or if someone called, or what the deal is, but she is needless to say, not a happy camper. The part that makes this doubly painful for me is that he is my godson, as well as being my friend's child.     ****Okay, now I am pissed. I just found out that both of her kids have been dragged off by the police and social services. I am pissed as all hell.
