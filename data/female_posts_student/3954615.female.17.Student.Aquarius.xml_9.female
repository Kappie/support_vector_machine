LoLX!  ok.. another half an hr passed. clarissa managed to go a few rounds. but she still had to hold on to something. huiqi was finally back, but without anyone with her. she said all the guys "mei liang xin de" which I TOTALLY AGREE! meridian guys are never gentlemen enough to help girls. that totally turned me off.   we thought that 2 hours will pass by very quickly and we had better drag clarissa back to the pit and come back to return the roller-bladers. and YES!! I FINALLY COULD OVERCOME THE BARRIER OF NOT BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE HUMPS!!!!!!!! hohoho!! that's a major major major achievement for me!! lalalala~  we finally managed to successfully drag clarissa back to the bbq pit. it was a very very long way. and there, i met xiaojun and she wanted me to pass something to christine so christine could pass it to yixiang. it was yixiang's birthday. xiaojun looked very tired and not like her usual self. then she wanted to go back home alone. how could i let xiaojun go home on her own right?! what if she faints on the bus.. or she gets kidnapped or bullied by some gangsters?! she looked so small and innocent it was very unsafe for her to go home alone. i managed to persuade her to stay and gave the sweet sweet smile which tempted her to stay. haha..  then clarissa didn't want to blade anymore. i guess she was very tired and she felt that she was not as good as us so she didn't want to slow us down. ok. a girl named wenqi wanted to blade too. so clarissa gave her bladers to wenqi. i had a mixture of feelings. firstly i didn't know wenqi, and i had no idea what i should talk to wenqi about. huiqi was saying that hopefully wenqi is not another clarissa. haha.. and she was wrong. wenqi can roller-blade on her own but she fell many many times. ouch.. that hurts. we finally reached the place of rental and returned the bladers.  by the time we reached the bbq pit.. it was pitch-darkness(wonder if i used this term correctly anot..) and manx.. i was so hungry. i was glad at least there are still alot of food around. i told myself i have to eat!! i must not let my $8 go to waste!!! but there are not much variety of food either.   felt kinda guilty. i asked xiaojun to stay and yet i went away to return the blades for like an hour. so i accompanied her throughout and we had some chats. late at night the winds became strong and we felt chilly. we finally left the place and took a cab home.  i realised guys like to wear the same thing. haha.. tt time at the VCH mjc choir concert i saw yixiang and fuquan wore exactly the same thing as at the bbq.  lastly.. -i hate dogs- they made me scream and shriek which i thought that made me sound irritating to people.
