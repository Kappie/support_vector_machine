That is the stupidest and most obvious thing I have ever heard before!  The perpetrator of that sentence is none other than...  *ominous music* KRISTEN STEFFICK!  What a moron.  Seriously, I feel so bad for her because the other day she asked me what an outline was...  I nearly shit a brick.  Oh well, those are the shit-kickers I have to deal with in Journalism. I don't mean to bring work into Blogger, but Jessie, I must know!  I have three photos that I need done.  Sean's, Susan's, and Kristen's.  I know Sean and Kristen have submitted requests to you, what is the status on that?  As far as Kristen's go, don't worry about it.  We have pictures from Ms. Benson. GET BETTER JESSIE and don't do drugs (i doubt it will help)
