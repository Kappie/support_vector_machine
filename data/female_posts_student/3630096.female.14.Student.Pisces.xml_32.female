It was already twelve by the time I had finally landed on my bed and entered the world of dreams. Yet that alarm clock woke me up so early in the morning that it felt only like an hour had passed. I dragged myself out of the bed and refresh myself and got dressed. Then I gave that girl a morning call who replied she got up earlier than expected! I'm sure a lot of people can't fall asleep that night. It was nervousness that's doing the trick. So nervous that nothing can cheer me up.I'm so worried, what will the outcome be? What if it's a failure? What if... Then I reached school and after a while [Pammy was there to support!! =)] we fall in. I was almost jumping with nervousness. What are they doing to open the band room!? It's SO long!!! I rushed all the way up the stairs when we fall out [mr ong specially came to give us encouragement but he didn't stay] and I banged into everyone else and set up the instrument. I was so nervous, rushing everywhere like hell. Is the score there? Are the stands enough? How many had we brought down? The worries were endless until we tuned [and I took the wrong instrument out of carelessness] [ a lot of sec4s seniors were there to watch and direct us and helped us out with stuff like tuning and arranging of chairs] and very quickly, we settled down and soon the parade started. We played with lots of confidence. It were the best marches I've ever played. We're Singapore sounded OK and loud enough with energy. Made in Singapore was the best version which I've played so far. We cannot smile...I wanted to, but it was so...so nervous, so scared. The whole school was watching and every move you took was watched by the majors and section leaders closely. We played with confidence so proud hanging on faces. All except One people, One nation, One Singapore. This is the song I had not yet managed to master. In the end, I freaked out and forgot to repeat!! Then I walked extremely fast, ashamed of my mistakes. I didn't tell anyone except Jaslyn. Then we keep our instrument. I was intending on borrowing but was not allowed. Sigh. It was four days! A lot of time to practise! Why must they do the stock check at this time!? So we changed into our bright red t shirts and slacked off from aces programme. It left only half an hour when we reached there and a lot of other people slacked off, totally didn't join in. After that was the active citizen show which is being displayed with expiriences of various people. Then we went back to the band room to take our stuff and jackets to be washed and went downstairs to eat. Then went to find Jiayi to go to Plaza for bowling, Junyi went along. At first Qiuming want to go, but seeing Jaslyn's expression, he gave in. Such disappointment. I've forgotten to pass up the English homework and ran all the way back to school just to submit the assignment. Then we squeezed up in a bus and later saw joel [who yelled at me for blocking his way with extreme anger! I HATE HIM! Now I realised, he's not that obedient nor that capable! He's just ^$#%I)^ ] The three of them, Nizam, Masturah and Joel went to Plaza too. and the anger that stupid major had given me was beginning to erupt...I felt like hitting him so much! SO RUDE!! Then went to bowling, Jaslyn kept on trying to keep their trails but in the end lost them. So we went to bowling, me as the spectator and met another shuai ge there... cute actually. Pity from badminton, not band. haiz. Then Daphne, Wheelynn and Ivy were there too. After a while, the trio came. It occurs to me that those two, Nizam and Masturah must be getting alone! What else? They make a perfect pair! Plus, he's not as shuai as before ... his discipline level dropped so much after band, which kinda make him... er-not that perfect? Enough about him, I dun like him. There're other guys in this world, right? LOL. But Joel's shouts and yells had really dampened my mood for the day. Now I really kan ta bu shuang liaoz! Just for a minor matter, then he yelled. He think he who!? That's too much, all right!? But it's really a great day and many sec4s come back to see the band. I'm glad we've achieved what we wanted, the best performance ever...
