Lately I have reverted to tossing a coin (which usually lands in the position that, in my gut, I didn't want it to) or I have been having a go at  urlLink Spike's Magic 8 Ball .  There used to be a site on the Internet that would make a decision for you if you provided the bare essential information.  Within three days, it emailed you to tell you what to do.  Can't make up my mind... hate having things up in the air... crossing my fingers for a moment of clarity...  More to come...
