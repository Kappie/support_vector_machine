MUCH better.  yesterday was fun... went over to charles's and intently played snake while pete watched dragon ball.  then we went to taco bell and i played some more snake.  and then we saw "the tuxedo" which was... interesting.  and theeennn we went to amy's partay for a while, then went to mamas pizza, and then watched "we were soldiers" at stephanie black's house.  slightly graphic movie... especially when the guys skin peels off (nassttyyy).  my mom left this morning to visit her parents in florida for a week.  so basically, i have no parents this week since my dad doesnt count, cuz half the time i ask him if i can do something, hes not really listening.  "hey dad can i go have sex?" "*still reading newspaper* mmhmmm whatever you want honey."  heh i love my dad...  theres no fball game this friday which im super excited about!  not much goin on today.. just gonna do hw, go to church, lay around- the usual sunday.  i dont really have anything more to say, so... til next time!  cool song alert! TRUSTcompany- "downfall" ... check it out!
