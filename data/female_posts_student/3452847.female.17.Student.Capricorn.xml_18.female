I'd like someone, someone to take my mind off things and have some fun with, i could have had that with Carlos but i got scared, scared of being hurt, scared of completely losing Jason and scared of the breaking up despite us being not being together... I'm happy for everyone who has someone or who's happy because they want to be single, but i just wish i could find someone... Someone kind, considerate, sexy and funny and someone who won't judge me for the mistakes or still liking my ex... As that is always a big problem. I find myself thinking about every guy that i meet. And this fucking candybar, i thought winding him up for a laugh between me and Ami would be funny, now he won't fucking go...  ~Lisa~
