Seems like every other post in Blurty is by a fifteen year old anorexic who wants to die.  I'm not the most mature person in the world, but that offended my sensibilities.    I hope to keep this one more of a secret.  The last one was discovered by a co-worker and my boyfriend.  These things can be such a liability, and I have found myself censoring my entries to preserve the peace.  Enough of that!  I will begin transferring my Blurty entries to this site for continuity's sake.  Just a note:  I am doing this on the clock.  I am a state employee.  Tax dollars at work.
