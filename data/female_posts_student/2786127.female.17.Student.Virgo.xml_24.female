Yeah...so I'm dancing around my room this morning to Genies mix cd she made me ( war, all of the time in the shadow of the new york skyline...*dance*)  and decide that hell, i've only worn my cute new blue bra only once since i bought it like, two weeks. ago. So I slide over to my dresser, open my underwear drawer, don't immediatly see it, so i fondle through all the stuff. ?. Not there. at all. And i know it was in there because i had seen it in there a few days ago...and i haven't moved it.  what the hell. whos been rummaging through my underwear drawer and snatching things?  Its not my sister, she takes countless other things from me but a bra, it would be pointless. I'm three sizes bigger then her. Logically it doesn't make sense.  okay.   So...only other person in my house is my dad...and god i hope he didnt take it cause, well...that would be somewhat uncomfortable....  none of danielles friends would have taken it, all of them have the same issue as she does (size AA issues...*cough*) The only friends of mine who are the same size as me are staci and makenzie...staci i dont allow in my house anymore because shes driving me crazy, and maknenzie? I'd like to think she wouldn't take it, in fact i know she didnt...she would tell me that she's snatching it.  so who the hell...i need to go all Nancy Drew on this mysteries ass...
