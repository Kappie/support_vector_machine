Do I deny this fact? Not at all. Would I let you call me strange in public? Not unless your name was Tabitha. So- now that that is cleared up I am moving on to a greater subject.  The Man with the Wounded Leg   I was sitting in Church today, and I saw this guy (not a bad looking guy..) with an injury on his left leg. It looked like a giant rug burn. It was so grotesque yet, I was intrigued. I spent the whole hour and a half thinking of why this dude's left leg had this enormous injury on it. Some of the stuff I came up with was simple. Like, for example, maybe he was a marine, and the injury came from this bloody scuff out in the far reaches of Afghanistan. I mean, that was possible. More possible than some of the stuff I came up with. Like, he was really a secret service agent and the injury came about because a mission went completely wrong and he was suspended from a 15 yard cable above these incredible black spikes. The cable snapped, sending him plummeting to his almost certain death, when out of no where at all, this British double agent swoops in and catches him. Not in time however, for the man with the left uninjured leg would now scrape his leg on the very last spike, crying out in terrified pain and anguish.   So, that obviously wasn't the case, but still, I think you can see what an over-active imagination I have. It's not that I don't try to pay attention, it's just that I can't help but think about these things whenever my mind is triggered. What triggers my mind? Everything! I could be staring at grass and come up with some seriously weird stuff! It's not that I am some freak, it's just that, I...I... have an overactive imagination! Some say that I should want to be a writer, not a scientist. And the other people, well, let's just say they are jealous.   Granted, my english skills suck, but someone somewhere has to give me props for being creative. It's not every day you meet a sarcastic, sadistic, creative person. Today must be your lucky day. That or, you have tripped upon my gold mine of useless knowledge and are questioning my sanity. Well, here's a thought: Leave me a comment. You know you want too.  What does this all amount too? Nothing actually. Absolutely nothing. That's why I have a blog. So I can write enormous amounts of words and never actually say  anything at all . It's a marvelous thing. Especially when it is 12:12 in the morning and you have absolutely nothing to do.    And then there were no more complaints.
