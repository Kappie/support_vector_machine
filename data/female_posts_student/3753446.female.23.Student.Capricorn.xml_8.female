Her collection is Great in variety, but only Because she takes the Tiniest samples of each Of many, many, blooms before She starts out again on the mad chase For sweetnessâ€¦  Only occasionally looking back With her wide open eyes With her episodic mind And remembers everything with gratitude. She cannot recall the path she  Took to arrive there but only That the trip was sweet and pure Beautiful and intriguing Just like her when the sticky honey Abundant and burdensome,  Spills and adheres to her motorized wings  Forces her to stop her bumbling And breathe it all in for a moment  It may be flighty and unstructured to the keen observer,  But it is fulfilling, purposeful and Colorful, the life of a lone honeybee
