Told me that she saw Judy on the train... I miss Judy lots too! Argh.... where have all my friends gone? Everytime the semester starts it seems that I have no time for my friends at all Everyday is project, tests... Where is my life? Its gone! Eeks... Happy that I'm gonna meet Mel on monday though.. She's coming over to SIM to photocopy some stuff.. Hehz.. means that I can go home with her... Reminds me of the times when I would wait for her at NYP to go out together.. I miss her...  I can't imagine what my life be without her.. She always manages to bring some happiness to my mundane life.. My sis, my gal... Love her to bits man... Hehe.. hope i won't become a lesbian.  William Hung is on today! Bet its gonna be a nice show in American Idol tonight... Gonna eat dinner now.. Cya!
