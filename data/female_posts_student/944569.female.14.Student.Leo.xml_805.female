I have...Mrs.Grimsley for English..That is also a good thing because my sister had her for English and she is supposed to be nice...Or at least just not mean.  M. Masson for H/G...He's supposed to be a French version as Mr. Aimers..Not as mean but doesnt giveout prizes..It's fair trade.  Hey..I just noticed..I have Mrs. Markle for Guidance.  Then I have some weirdo teachers that I never heard of.   O yeah..Ms. Stewart is supposed to be like the nicest art teacher ever..Total opposite of Mme Daniwe..M. Tacq is supposed to smell like B.O a lot.  Reminds me of the leprachaun like..M. Sohier.
