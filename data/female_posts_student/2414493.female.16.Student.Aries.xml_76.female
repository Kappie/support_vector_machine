Went to bed at 7:30 and slept straight until 9 this morning. It seems like I missed out on something. Oh well, I dreamt of Grandma's 80th birthday party and the pool and a really big building and flushing golden goldfish down a sink.  And now I'm just sitting here.  I have the honors recital tomorrow afternoon, and for some strange reason, I have to play the Szumanowski. I did not play it well during panel. Hm, wonder how that works now. It's just really slow, which makes me want to give up on it after thirty minutes, never enough. And the Ravel needs fixing before Thursday. Ick, I'm scared. The lecturer is the lady that edited my Ravel book. I guess I have the advantage of being able to read her footnotes, but the question is--will I? I tend to make stupid mistakes like that.  Completely apathetic right now. I have to be at school by 2 to help set up for Hollywood Knights, and frankly, I don't care much for it. I guess it's just to help T out, but if it means staying up until midnight for something I'm not all too passionate about. And to see J get so riled up about it and to hear the other side from T...not too pleasant.  Yaay, I get to drive Grandma's car to school at 2. Alone, haha. I'm bringing a CD. The possibilities unfold...  Maybe I'm too excited about Harvard. I woke up this morning thinking about it and I just couldn't go back to sleep. In a little more than three months I'll find myself in lovely Cambridge, and that just kills me. Almost. I looked up yesterday all the houses of Harvard on their website, and it's just so funny. One house has a "Drag Night."  February is better, and you know it!
