Friday's BBQ went off great, I think we have to have one like once a month fo sho. I could do that every night. Well, maybe not the sleeping on the ground part, but definitely the chilling in the backyard at night part! But we need to learn how to make a good fire. Died down so quick! But anyway that really rocked and I love you guys (awww)! Great way to start off the summer, as Ryan said...  Yesterday we saw Donnie Darko, it was really good, but the bunny was so scary.... But you know when you're just in the mood for a dark movie... yeah it was really good. I'm still trying to work it all out in my head; I'm not sure if it's supposed to make sense, even. I'm just wondering what was put IN the movie for the director's cut... leaving out anything would not make any sense! You guys should go see it and tell me what you think. Oh man that rabbit was scary though. That was a really fun day... I'm in big trouble for being out too late (uhhh two hours too late) but who cares it was worth it. *ROUND 27* it's OOONNNN, Ryan!!! You're goin' DOWN! You just had the home-base advantage.  >:|  ..... Lol. I'll never beat you... (*'cause you're a man, a manny man man* ....lololol i'm funny) but I'll never stop trying!!! ...Natalie never quits! ....Except for that one time... Today we went with Caitlin's family to see the Billy Joel musical, Movin' Out, the dancers were soo talented, but it was very confusing because there was no dialogue and it was just interpretive dancing. But it was Billy Joel music and that just makes everything awesome! Yay! And now... I have to go to sleep because I have to wake up at 6:30. For school. For three hours of school. What the hell. Oh well. I feel fufilled by a very satisfying weekend.
