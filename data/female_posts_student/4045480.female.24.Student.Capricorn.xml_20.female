Found out there are six other student teachers in various departments, good times.  Have my second day tomorrow, looking forward to it, still have jitters though.  Had my second to last Qualitative Research class today, other class got cancelled.  Will be happy when it's over and I can focus on other things.  Went out for the twin's 21st b-day, had to take care of my sis, she was/is blitzed.  My bro was just fine, didn't really drink much.  Oh and my tolerance level, quite low, one shot, one vodka cranberry and I was on the verge of tipsy, one more and I would've been on the floor.  Damn low carb diet.  BTW, starting south beach diet again soon, really want to loose another ten to twenty pounds.  I'm really shooting for a sexier bod here,   I think I've picked out a good regime to start a bit this week and next for after school.  Very psyched.  That's all for now, TTFN!
