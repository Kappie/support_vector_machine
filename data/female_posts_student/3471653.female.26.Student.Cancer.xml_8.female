I'm going to be herding fourth-graders around from activity to activity;  Matt and   urlLink Tim  will contend with the third-graders, who are supposed to be a rowdy lot this year.     We're on a seven-year cycle through the Old Testament; this year it's Genesis, so we're going to start out in the Garden of Eden, thoughtfully assembled by our friend Nancy and others out of houseplants and a wading pool.  Does anyone want to place bets on how they handle Adam and Eve, pre-fall?    The best part of VCS is the song.  Father Timothy and Holden always get together and write an original song, vaguely gospelly or jazzy or bluesy, adapted to the summer's theme, and then pound away on the piano as the rest of us sing it at the top of our lungs.
