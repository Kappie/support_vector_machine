I was standing up, shouting lovey dovey sad lyrics... Dancing prancing around wit YJ all day... Maybe its because I was feeling sad over my last relationship.. and hearing those soppy love ballads was absolute torture that I have to destroy them all.. I had loads of fun getting my classmates into fits of laughter.. But I really wonder if that was necessary now.. Wonder if they are gonna gossip about me.. I had to tell them I'm single again.. They will find out one day anyway.. I had an announcement of my once again failed relationship...   I find that one of the most hardest thing to do after a breakup is facing up to the reactions of other people.. Other people refers to aquaintances.. Being strong, acting that you are still happily getting on with your life... Not allowing others to feel sorry for yourself... Wanting others to feel that you are not weak at all.. That u need no pity.. It just sucks..  Its been two weeks since my breakup, I still hurt nonetheless.. Still in a state of uncertainty.. Still in a state of missing him.. Still stuck in my own self pity wall of loneliness.. Not wanting anyone to know how miserable I get sometimes... Feeling that I will never love again.. That I will never meet anyone who loves me... Everyone around me seems to be happily attached but me... Maybe love just doesn't happen to me.. To low profile people like me.. What do I have to offer? I'm just boring, overly sensitive, stupid.  I now have these pangs of loneliness where all the memories will suddenly creep up on me... Then it gradually disappears as I use logic to convince myself we can never be.. But its hard to get over these pangs of self pity.. I need to find strength within myself..  Its only in my blog that I can be truthful.. And I'm having a pang now... God I miss him.. I miss his hugs, his kisses, cuddles.. His mother's cooking.. His room, his face, his stammering I miss holding his hand.. I miss watching tv together, midnight dao huey.. I miss the feeling of having someone by my side.. Ten months of memories.. IT hurts so much, I feel half alive... I feel half empty..  Has he met anyone already? Maybe he has a new gal now... He seems to have forgotten about me totally.. I hate him.. How could he ever hurt me like that? Why did I hurt him? What have I done? Why does my relationship fail all the time? is there something wrong with me? I screwed up again.. I just pushed him away, as I had done with others..  I can't sms him. I know I will only hurt myself even more if I do that. I know i'm being illogical but sometimes I really wish to see him again. And feel the familiarity of his hand and his smile when he sees me.. The feeling that he loves me.. The feeling of being loved.  SOmetimes in life, we have to go through pain to learn. Its a part of the whole journey... I know that. But I'm only human. So let me wallow for now  Fuck it with the whole world
