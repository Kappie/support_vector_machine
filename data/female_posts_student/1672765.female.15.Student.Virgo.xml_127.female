Algebra II gives me a funny feeling. It's a very bad feeling and I don't know why exactly I get it. Everyday I feel completely exhausted in it. I mean I try and not feel tired, try and pay attention, but no matter what we do, even if it's something half way interesting, something I acutally get, I still feel exhausted. So you can see why I felt so horrible today in Algebra II. It was the worst. I was this close )( to crawling out of my seat and lying on the floor.  I don't think I'm just tired because of my lack of sleep. When I did sleep I don't think I slept  well . And whatever I have makes me feel really burned-out.  I feel way better than I did in Algebra II though.  All I remember about last night is I kept finding myself coughing and hacking and my throat burning.  Then I finally was wide awake at about 6, 20 minutes before my alarm goes off.   It's not been the greatest of days but it's been okay. It went by FAST! Latin's never gone by so fast EVER. Programming went by fast too. Crazy. Heck, now that I think of it English did too. And even though Algebra II was unbearable, it did kind of go by faster than usual (shows how slow it usually goes by).  No school for me tomorrow. Just pain and torment. But no school. It's well worth it.
