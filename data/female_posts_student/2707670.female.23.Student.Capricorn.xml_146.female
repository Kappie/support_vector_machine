If you loop the letter ‘c’ at the top = you are vain The lower you cross your ‘t’s = the less ambition you have If you curve your ‘w’ and ‘v’ = you are sensitive and poetic If your signature is different than your regular handwriting = you are putting on a show If your handwriting is angular = you need to relax If your letters are squatty (short/fat/rounded…like Disney) = you are childish
