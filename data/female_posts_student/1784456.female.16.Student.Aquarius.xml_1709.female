Everyone always knows someone that you don't, has been somewhere you haven't and knows things you don't. Somehow they always want to rub this in your face. "Oh, you don't know Bob?" Then Bob turns out to be the saddest person on the planet who's hobbies is collecting glass. But you weren't to know that, and for all you know Bob might be the next Bon Jovi *better not to know him then* I still haven't placed some people. They're swimming round in my head. What makes someone cool though, or funny? Does one thing that they say alter your whole view of them and should it? I guess it depends what it is. If it's something really prejudice or anti-you then maybe it should *sudden pear craving* but if it's only something that they say off hand *is that a real word/thing?* then maybe it shouldn't. Most people say that first impressions always count and it's hard to change those. So people that you've known for years base their view of you on how they first say you all those years ago? Maybe I should become a Psychiatrist. Then I can think of all these questions for other people to answer. :D Uhh... or maybe Mr Nutbrown *my english teacher* will lock me in a room till I think of the answers... Hmm... *insert clever conclusion here, or in the comments box :P*
