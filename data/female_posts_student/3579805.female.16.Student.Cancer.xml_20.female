Man was i pissed. Danielle is being a huge bitch and i swear to god if she ever says anything about my father again i will find her and break every bone in her body. UGH!!!!!!!!!!! heres her quote "my problems may not be big to you but you no what they are to me you think you  have it so bad well your wrong at least you still have your mom you just need to be grate ful and stop saying how your life is so horrible compared to everyon elses people have problems that yours dont  even compare to so just stop feeling sorry for your self" Her biggets fucking problem right now is that her mom wont let her go to her bf's house anymore cuz she found out theyd been having oral sex and found a hicki on her. At least i still have my mom??? WHO is she to say anything like that, she has two parents she has no idea what its like to lose your father. That bitch.I never said my life was so horrible  i know i have it pretty damn good but her problems are a fucking parade compared to mine. I have to live every day of my life with my dad dead. I was only 12 when he died and so help me god if she ever fucking even speaks his name i will punch her in the face.Oh because i think im so badass(sarcasm for those people who are as dumb as i am). And i sure as hell dont walk around feeling sorry for myself. Ask any one of my friends and theyll tell you i dont feel sorry for myself. I dont walk around like woe is me life is so hard fuck that i know shit happens and you gotta just keep living your life but its still hard and you cant comment on my life and me "at least still having my mom" i am greatful for everything i have so who the hell is she to basicly tell me im an ungreatful little bitch who feels sorry for hersle. I DONT FUCKING THINK SO!!!!!!!!!!!! grrrrrrrrrrrrrr when her god damn dad dies then she can talk to me about something like that fuck her......
