Just for the record its not a good idea to ever, ever sit down at a table you are waiting on, find out the girls you are talking to are at least four years younger than you, and then give your number to one of them while informing them that you are off the next day.  Under no circumstances is that acceptable. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with getting attention and if he had been someone else, maybe someone younger who I had met more than once, I would have been flattered and would have considered calling (lets face it, probably would have called)--but no, its not ok to try to pick up minors whom you have never met when you are graduating college in the next year.  Sorry, had to get that out of my system.
