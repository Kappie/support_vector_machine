Nope, because my name means idiot.  *laughs triumphantly*  Kuronue:  That's really not something to be proud of.  Baka:  Forget you.  Why don't you just slip out of existence?  Kuronue:  *stares blankly*  Baka:  It seems you already have.  By the way, speaking of Japanese, I am writing a story of how I really met the YYH gang.  It's called "Baka no Hakusho" which means Idiot's Report, but since my name is Baka it is "Baka's Report."  You can also read "The Misadventures of Baka, Cinni, and the YYH Gang."  I'm writing that with Muiya, but I'll probably have to change the title.  The address is bakanohakusho.blogspot.com.  I love it.  Misadventures is bandcinyyh.blogspot.com.  Oh man, Mom's watching The View.  Help!  Kuronue:  What's the matter, Baka?  Don't like that show?  Baka:  It's on the same level as Oprah and Martha Stewart.  Bleah!  Evil!  They are the utter faces of evil.  Kuronue:  Hey, Sparrow, got any room at your place?
