It's not easy. ^_^ Thankfully, I have Maju there, and yet at the same time, not having her there would teach me to be more independent...  Met up with Murilo and again. I haven't seen them since the Festa de Junina do on my first night in Brasil. LOL, Murilo taught me my first words (that were not of the 'hello' 'goodbye' 'thankyou' variety) He taught me lua cheia (full moon) and cachorro (dog)...lol,aren't you proud?  Got to leave school early because the teacher didn't show up for last class. Damn, why doesn't that happen in Canada? We walked home and I...thankfully got an e-mail from willeke. And ROBIN!! Yay....I miss my friends lol. A squirrel (apparently of the Foamy variety ( urlLink Click here  for more info....LOL  **Willeke: I know you read this, and Robin doesn't so, make sure to tell her (and maybe Paul too...LOL), that I know I complain and bitch a lot to you guys, but it's only because I need advice from you right away where as...all the good stuff that's happening here, it's a hundred thousand times better if I tell you in person. Typing...it's just to hard to explain that way.  Now! I'm going surfing! I'm so excited! I've always wanted to surf. Going with Carlos...not sure if anybody else is going. I don't think so. After I'm finished that, I'm going to go meet up with Matt, if he phones, at Cento terminal and take a bus with him to go down to the airport to say good-bye to Tom. It's a shame I didn't meet him more then a couple times....  Ugh, got to go. Have to go get changed.  Later days!
