The virus Adam's computer had was not as bad as we originally expected. It was actually a quick fix, it would have been fixed faster if I had Ian around. I hope Ian and Abby had fun together yesterday, their final day together was probably very emotional. Anyway, I am back and I will get back to posting every night.
