I hate when its windy.. windy means turbulence.. turbulence means the plane bounces all over the place... I don't think there's a sane person in the world who could possibly enjoy turbulence... Oh well...  4 Hour layover in Calgary of all places... I can't remember the last time I was in the Calgary airport.. eons ago no doubt... gross.. but oh well.. maybe I can put a dent in that homework.  I shall be sure to leave a message here when I arrive so everyone knows I'm safe... heh.. then don't expect to hear from me until after the Wedding on the 20th... possibly not even until the 23rd depending how hectic things get... Wishin I could drag everyone along with me! (in for good measure.. no one hate me)
