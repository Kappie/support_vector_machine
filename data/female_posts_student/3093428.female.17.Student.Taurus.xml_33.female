He's paying me to print off 500 copies of his band's CD, because I have a connection with a CD printing press. I called his house to update him and he wasn't home, but his mom wanted to speak with me, so she did. She made me feel like total crap. I hate that. When adults talk down to you. But whatever. I'm over it, sort've. I'll get the job done, he'll pay me and he'll get the CDs and I doubt I'll ever be working with them again. It's unfortunate because I really enjoy their music. But I don't need someone's mom telling me about the job I'm doing.  Bowling was fun tonight, don't you guys agree? Only, I was majorly disappointed with the lack of disco going on. And the fact that I got two strikes in a row at the END OF A GAME. They should've happened earlier on. Bummer. However, my spirits were uplifted during the sing and shout par-tay on the bus back to the church. Another thing that annoyed me though, is the new guys that were at the youth group. I'm all down for welcoming new people in the group and making new friends, but I thought it was so rude that they were abusing everything. Languages, attitudes, the church building... I'm trying not to make a big deal, but it bugs/hurts me so much to see someone yell something like, "Praise the Lord!" knowing that they don't care anything for the three words they just said. It really, really hurts.  I think I'm mistreating this website. I'm ranting too much. I'm sorry, continue.
