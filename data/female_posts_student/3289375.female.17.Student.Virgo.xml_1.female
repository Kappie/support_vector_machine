Her name is Maribel and she is one of the most important people in my life. I have gotten to know her so well this whole semester. At first, i was like "man i can't stand her" or "she's annoying" but what i didnt know is that i was misjudging a person i didnt even know and just took other people's word against hers. People would tell me stuff about her and man i use to think the worse of her till i sat down with her one day to talk in luch which was right there behind that painting in that picture.   We just sat down and talked about our problems and what i realized is that she needed somebody to talk to just like me. She has gotten so close to me she became like my little sister and i have gotten so much affection for her just because she was there for me and for the great person she was and still is. Last week, she made one of the everyday mistakes a teenager makes in life but this time, it really came with hard consequences. She wont be coming back to school (which sux). I tried my best to be a good friend to her and to be there and to try to make her change her mind of different things and in a way i feel bad because i feel like i didnt push her hard enough to make her realize what she was doing was stupid. I feel like if i left her down. She has nobody in this world, just her dad, her brother and sisters.     Things arent going to change jus cuz shes not in the same school as me, i am still going to keep in touch with her cuz i know she needs me now more than anything and i will still go visit her just because i love her and because she was there whenever i didnt have no one and i just want to thank her for that. I wouldnt change any thing about her just that she wouldnt have done what she did which made her be gone now. I feel like i lost a part of me that i use to bring with me to school , she use to make me lighten up and to smile and to enjoy every moment of my life and that is what im going to continue to do just for her... i love you girl and remember im here for you whenever u need me.
