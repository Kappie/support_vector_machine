Never Cold. 7/27   i'm almost sure my body's sleeping.  closed off to the world; hibernating.  you try to say i'm cold, but my body's not shaking.  i am not shaken  i am not afraid.  the heat i am keeping penetrated your bones  while you were there sleeping with me in your arms.  that love kept us warm. but this hate boils my blood.  so now that i'm hiding, you think that i'm cold.  little do you know my heart beats so fast that it  boils my blood  i'll never be cold again. - christine.    I Lived (in your arms) 7/27    you thought that you were the one keeping me warm.  all those nights i lived in your arms.  we were always so close but we kept ourselves so far.  you never accepted that i was still living while we were apart.  thought i could never be warm without you there.  what a way to show how much you cared. (that much faith in me?)  leave me here see if i can still feel.  with my heart in your hands, you poked and prodded,  but never breaking it again.  saying how you would never leave me to be cold.    keep my heart warm in your hands, or    please reintroduce it to this hold in my chest.   - christine.     yeah, i wrote the first one out of boredom. and then when i read it i felt like contradicting myself partially. emotionally monogamous with a sentimental overdrive and a habit to hold old grudges just as long asi hold onto everything else. and we all know, i have a big problem with temptation, expectation, and letting go. - i don't know what to sign these things anymore. so i guess i won't.       the one thing that i'll never get is how you turned out like all the rest, but i can take it, i can take it.
