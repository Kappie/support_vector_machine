"it takes a lifetime to find the answer we seek. and takes a second to learn what we never wanted to know." GOTTA LET IT BURN. when something aint going your way, it probably never will. let it go.  Look at life a different way, it may change how to see it forever. Everyday day in day out we look @ life the way we think we should look @ it, but maybe thats just your fantasy. Find you reality. Lies are lovely and i love them .  "So please forgive what I have done No you can't stay mad at the setting sun Cause we all get tired, I mean eventually There is nothing left to do but sleep" --> No Lies Just Love By Bright Eyes.   When the world ends whose gonna read these anyway?
