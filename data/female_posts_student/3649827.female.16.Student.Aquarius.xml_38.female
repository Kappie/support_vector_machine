Mood:  oh hunger yet no will to do anything about it  Music:  Let's Get it Started -- the BEPs well...that's what's on tv and my sister has this newly developed fixation on radio disney...channel 940 yo. -_-;  i really really really need my license. i never thought i would get a car before i got my fucking license. but that is the way it seems to be going. *sigh* last night, i went to Moe's with blinkie, zach, ashley, nadia and jordan. and it was neat. and then jd and will came and we ate, and had a nice little convo about masterbation. then we went up to coldstone. but no ice cream for tazzy. cuz she was full. oh yes she was. but then jd and will left. and we went over to jordan's to watch clockwork orange. what a motherfucking strange movie. those crazy europeans. i don't really think i have nething to say, i don't know what was the point in this. i think i shall steal the television from my sibling, and feed myself. i have stuff to do. school's in a week. *can't believe she just said that.* and i still have so much fucking shitty things to do. grrz. i think blinkie and nadia might spend the night tomorrow night. that will be fun. and we'll watch the party. ahh...childhood memories. tis a link to my innocence. teehee. i haven't been obsessed in a while. i'll be ok. i think. anyways. the day is young. and i have the oppurtunity to accomplish something. i will try.
