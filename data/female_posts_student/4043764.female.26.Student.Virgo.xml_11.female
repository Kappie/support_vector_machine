I know I'm putting a lot of personal stuff out there for y'all to read, but politics, television show reviews and broken relationships need to be exchanged for something else - at least for a few hours. There must be some things I am holding close or simply forgetting. Does anyone have any questions? If there is sufficient response (more than 5 or 6), I'll put all the answers in a post. Otherwise, I'll just personally respond to them. Deadline: Saturday, August 21, 8:00 pm EST (GMT -5).
