I was so nervous because dancing isn't my number one talent...but I didn't the best I could have ever done! I was pretty proud of myself :)    Then I went home then straight to the voice lesson.  I am learning a sue-wheat song! Its called "I remember" its pretttty!  Then we went to church, it was ok, I was super duper tired though so it was hard to pay attention.  Then my brothers and I went back home and ate so verrryy good foood! I ate so much, I feel I will never be hungry again!!!  Then we went to Wal-Mart to pick up my glasses.
