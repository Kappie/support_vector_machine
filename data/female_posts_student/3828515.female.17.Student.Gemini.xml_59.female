And I am first chair in the saxophone section this year, so that is pretty cool. The morning session of band camp was a pain. You know, reviewing how to walk and stand is not exactly my idea of fun. I went home for lunch and ate some food, sat around, played the piano. We had our music rehearsal in the afternoon, and I realized that there are not many good saxophone players in the band this year. Or, if there are any, they simply were not at camp. So yeah. Dinner came next. That was a nice break. The night session today was cool, most definitely. Paul, Jake, and Mikey B. are in my squad this year, so that should provide for some good times. Anyways. I was hoping for some more interesting and rigorous drills and music... That always makes band just a little more fun for those of us who actually wish to try. However, the show this year is downright elementary and stupid. Straight lines, lines, lines... Hey, look! More lines! Probably because we're slacking off for not going to U of I this year. Roar. I'll stop complaining now. By the way, our dismissal is awesome! I wonder why ;)... Well that was really not a short post at all. Oh well. Good night.      Last song I listened to:   Magic  by Ben Folds Five.   Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .   Last meal I ate:  Scallops with linguine.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  First chair saxophone, baby! Woot woot!   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Don't Change Your Plans  by Ben Folds Five.   Favorite food today:  Salad with Italian Dressing.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Umm... Went to band camp? Oh, actually, that is  all  I did today :P.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Permanent convertible! And the idea of Jayne driving an airbrushed car with a tarp over her head. Good times.
