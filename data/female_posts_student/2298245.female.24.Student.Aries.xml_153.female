Let's just say I'm not going for total accuracy, and I'm trying to work the surprise factor in as well.  And in some of the..hrm..less important categories, I'm actually blindly guessing (in case you can't tell) So here we go, in the order in which the  urlLink Oscar website  gives them to me:  Best Actor:  Bill Murray Best Supporting Actor:  Tim Robbins Best Actress:  Charlize Theron Best Supporting Actress:  Renee Zellweger Animated Feature Film:  Finding Nemo Art Direction:  Lord of the Rings Cinematography:  Cold Mountain Costume Design:  Girl with a Pearl Earring Best Director:  Peter Jackson Documentary Feature:  Capturing the Friedmans (which the ads on the F train have really made me want to see) Documentary Short Subject:  Asylum Film Editing:  Lord of the Rings Foreign Language Film:  The Barbarian Invasions Makeup:  Lord of the Rings Music (Score):  Lord of the Rings Music (Song):  "Into the West," Lord of the Rings Best Picture:  Lord of the Rings Short Film (Animated):  Nibbles Short Film (Live Action):  Two Soldiers Sound Editing:  Master and Commander Sound Mixing:  Lord of the Rings Visual Effects:  Lord of the Rings Writing (Adapted Screenplay):  Mystic River Writing (Original Screenplay):  Lost in Translation  Okay, so after going through that little exercise, I think most of those were guesses.  I think it's going to be a big night for Lord of the Rings, mostly, so I picked it for nearly everything.  And tomorrow night I'll find out just how wrong I really am.    In case anyone wants to know, here are the odds in the big categories from  urlLink several online bookmakers .  Oh, and for those of you having Oscar parties, here are  urlLink printable ballots  in case you want to have a contest for picking the winners.  Real money is optional, depending on how wealthy you happen to be.
