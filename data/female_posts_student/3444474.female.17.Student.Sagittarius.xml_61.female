I couldn't post this morning, I was so busy today, putting binders together for my boss for next week. I'm almost done though (yay), tomorrow I've just got a couple more things to photocopy, then I'm good to go!   /stoked   Greg: I just realized I haven't talked to you in two solid days. Not good. :(   Awww, I felt so special after reading that today, lol.   I (heart) you Greg, :D  In other news, I saw  The Brighton Beach Memoirs  last night, TEH FUNNY!!! And I saw all these people I hadn't seen in forever, it was just fantastic, I loved it. So did Cameron. I didn't realize how much I really missed the Foote School until that night, and I was sitting there watching, and I felt so odd not being up there. The set was AMAZING, it looked as if someone had cut a house in half, and you could see into the house like that. Like those old Polly Pockets, where you'd open the little compact, and see all the rooms, the stairs, hallways, things like that. There were two stories on the set, an upstairs and a downstairs, and it was just absolutely amazing, I hadn't seen anything like it. Insane props to set master Frank Alberino for that, once again he designed something incredible, and it was fabulous. Those techies are daaaaaamn good, lol. Except Travis, but we won't go there right now, :P  Tonight,  Pride and Prejudice !! So excited to see what THIS set looks like, and to see everyone else and, oooooooo it's going to be so cool, I am teh excited!!  I better go shower and get ready, yay!
