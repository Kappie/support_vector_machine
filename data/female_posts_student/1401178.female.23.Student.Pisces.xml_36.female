(me and sis) Then tried on something new. Just like the ol' bang-the-moles type of game. Only with several choices of item to bang on. I rules! Got 12 tickets (sis only got 4). Anyway...it's a fun day.  Oh...the Pizza Hut was divine as always.  Oh...and the quiz. I don't understand why I'm Jacques Villenueve. I thought I'm more a Trulli-kind-of-gal. Oh whatever...     urlLink Take the F1 drivers quiz on supersonicsquirrel.net    Note: Ding dong is slank for video game. It came from the sound video games used to make...'ding dong'. Get it?
