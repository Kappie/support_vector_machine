You will drive a orange aston martin. You will marry meri and have 2 kids. You will be a architect in italy.   so ... i guess ... not only will i live in cali with nate and our 12 children .. but i'll also be driving around italy in an aston martin with my ripped architect husband timmy! oo lala how jealous are you now biatch??!?!?!?! xoxo
