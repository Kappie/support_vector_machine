I think I'm going to try to update every day, too.  maybe I'll even update at a specific time!  but probably not.  I am too lazy.  haha.  do you think I should tell the world about this blog?  then it'll have more interesting comments... but not nearly as much interesting stuff on the posts.  cuz then it'd have to pass through a more severe censor.  anyways, I have seventy more pages of GE to read before tomorrow.  and some crappy life lessons to think up.  at lunch, most likely.  whoo.  I have to go type up my cultural event!  TOMORROW IS SCHOOL AGAIN!!  good thing is, now I can breathe!  I was talking to ning on the phone today...  she told me that pearl lee knows of the "sunshine sun" joke.  I was like, "wth?"  then I was like, "omg, that thing spreads FAST."  and then I realized that about 3 different people thought of it at the same time.  egads.  it's spreading!!!  this sucks butt.  and then she asked me if I liked jack.  and I said no.  "are you sure?" 'positive.' "positive positive?" 'yeah... but if I continue to work with him on all these projects, I probably will start to like him sooner or later.  just cuz my mind will say -hey, sunshine, how come you don't like jack?  you see so much of him... I think it'd only be proper if you liked him-, and then I'll begin liking him.  then I'll see he's really just a pompous ass and get over it.'  then we debated if jack went out with girls before or not.  I think no, not seriously [as in maybe he went and saw a movie with some, but nothing serious], and ning thinks he's made out with every girl in canada.  -_____-;;  now.  let's try writing stream of consciousness style.  but I can't not take it.. there's a test sitting right in front of me!  I can't ignore it!  I have to go scratch my toe soon.  egads.  straight up... hmm.  I don't really like paula abdul.  I wonder why I'm using paragraph breaks in this... I want to go download under the tuscan sky.  or was it under this tuscan sky?  grace just signed off.  i wonder if she really got off or if she just closed her eye.  i'm too lazy to go check.  neopets is addicting.  why am I so competitive in everything?  why do i feel i must be best at everything?  even something as trivial as neopets.  i wonder if i would be happier being stupid.  i love the song superman.  i think it describes gundam wing perfectly.  i love it so so much.  it's so sad and melancholy, though.  i don't like melanie much.  i thikn i'm relaly jealous of her.  why?  why?  why am i jealous of people?  maybe i feel i'm inferior.  i probably am.  i must be better than melanie.  i must go paint a portrait of jack and give it to him to say thank you.  i wonder when jack's mom will be back.  i like jack's mom.  she's so nice to me.  she has really small feet.  i like jack's dad.  he's nice to me, too.  his whole freaking family is so nice to me.   i wonder what he thinks of my family.  too overbearing?  i feel they are too overbearing.  why is jack signing on and off?  didy annoys me at times. m aybe i am jealous of her, too.  then why am i not jealous of kailing?  i probably am.  i don't like this.    am i protective of jack?  i feel i am.  i think i'm possessive.  taht's not good.  why am i possessive of jack?  i don't even like him.  or do i?  i probably do.  but denial is so much more fun than reality.  i don't want to be possessive.  why didn't i focus all my energy on someone else?  that would have been so much better.  i think i am drifting farther away from meng and jackie.  i think it's because of movie project.  but i really cannot say i'd choose to change my group, had i the chance.  but i don't like losing meng.  i don't like jenna.  i hate her guts.  she is so preppy and annoying and girlly.  i agree with chuan about that.  i want to know who chaun is thinking of.  i want to go kill jenna.  i don't like her at all.  i think i hate her even more than I hate melanie.  melanie kissed jack for their movie.  jenny tells me on the lips.  i do not know what to think.  i think she enjoyed it, even though she has protested it so severely.  go figure.  stupid idiot.  and that is all for my stream of consciousness tonight.  =)
