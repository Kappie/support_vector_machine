Steve from Eton Manor Running Club kindly agreed to act as rapporteur for this plan pulling together the various ideas people had into something more formal. I would hope too at the next meeting a more formal Friends group can then be set up to take the plan forward and work with partner agencies such as BCTV, the local authority etc on the plan. Personally, I think key to the future of the site will be developing a plan which reflects the two sides of the area that people like best- all the activities and sporting facilities they enjoy and the slightly wild, open space,quiet, contemplative aspect of visiting Marsh Lane Fields.This probably means we need to look at some sort of 'zoning' plan for the area, with a clear management strategy to ensure no one area is damaged by over use or mis-use. I also hope that the differingbodies who use the site for sporting activitiessuch as the running club, LA Raiders and the Lammas Schoolcan work together on a single proposal as I think we'll stand more chance of bothgaining funding for this and achieving a consensusabout the future of Marsh Lane Fields. However, as I stressed last night,its upto local residents to decide what they want and to make it happen- I'm keen to help as much as I canbut the group needs to bemore than a talkingshop if it is to achieveits ambitions for Marsh Lane Fields! I'm happy for people to use this blog as a forum to comment on the points raised or add their own or you can email me on  urlLink cllrs.creasy@lbwf.gov.uk  or steve on  urlLink etonmanor@aol.com  with your views if you would prefer not to post publicly.
