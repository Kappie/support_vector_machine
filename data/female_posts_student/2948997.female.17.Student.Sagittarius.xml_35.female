In first grade your idea of a good friend was the person who went to the bathroom with you and held your hand as you walked through the scary halls.   In second grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you stand up to the class bully.   In third grade your idea of a good friend was the person who shared their lunch with you when you forgot yours on the bus.   In fourth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who was willing to switch square dancing partners in gym so you wouldn't have to be stuck do-si-do-ing with Nasty Nick or Smelly Susan.   In fifth grade your idea of a friend was the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you.   In sixth grade your idea of a friend was the person who went up to Nick or Susan, your new crush, and asked them to dance with you, so that if they said no you wouldn't have to be embarrassed.   In seventh grade your idea of a friend was the person who let you copy the social studies homework from the night before that you had forgotten.   In eighth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pack up your stuffed animals and old baseball but didn't laugh at you when you finished and broke out into tears.   In ninth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who would go to a party thrown by a senior so you wouldn't wind up being the only underage person there.   In tenth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who changed their schedule so you would have someone to sit with at lunch.   In eleventh grade your idea of a good friend was the person who gave you rides in their new car, convinced your parents that you shouldn't be grounded, consoled you when you broke up with Nick or Susan, and found you a date to the formal.   In twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pick out a college/university, assured you that you would get into that college/university, helped you deal with your parents who were having a hard time adjusting to the idea of letting you go...   At graduation your idea of a good fri end was the person who was crying on the inside but managed the biggest smile one could give as they congratulated you.   The summer after twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you clean up the bottles from that party, helped you sneak out of the house when you just couldn't deal with your parents, assured you that now that you and Nick or you and Susan were back together, you could make it through anything, helped you pack up for university and just silently hugged you as you looked through blurry eyes at 18 years of memories you were leaving behind, and finally on those last days of childhood, went out of their way to give you reassurance that you would make it in college as well as you had these past 18 years, and most importantly sent you off to college knowing you were loved.   Now, your idea of a good friend is still the person who gives you the better of the two choices, holds your hand when you're scared, helps you fight off those who try to take advantage of you, thinks of you at times when you are not there, reminds you of what you have forgotten, helps you put the past behind you but understands when you need to hold on to it a little longer, stays with you so that you have confidence, goes out of their way to make time for you, helps you clear up your mistakes, helps you deal with pressure from others, smiles for you when they are sad, helps you become a better person, and most importantly loves you!   Thank you for being a friend. No matter where we go or who we become, never forget who helped us get there.   There's never a wrong time to pick up a phone or send a message telling your friends how much you miss them or how much you love them.   You know who you are, pass it on to someone who you want to remind.   If you love someone, tell them.  Remember always to say what you mean.   Never be afraid to express yourself. Take this opportunity to tell someone what they mean to you. Seize the day and have no regrets.   Most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that you are today and are what it's all about anyway. Pass this along to your friends. Let it make a difference in your day and theirs.   The difference between expressing love and having regrets is that the regrets may stay around forever.      So what does that make one think? I've never had the same friends for more than three years or known the same people for more than six years. Alot of these memories are foreign to me. Is it because of me? Or is it because of my constant craving of change and mutation? Is there something wrong with me? Am I the kind of person that you only stay friends with for a small portion of time? What about partners? I've never been involved for more than 1 month and 27 days (how sad that I know the exact period) but what is it? I think I associate with a shapeshifter the best. I'm just a constant sneaky backstabbing mutation.   Do I take this email as bogus? or what...do I delete it and say fuck you and fuck you having your friends? No. I decide to dwell and write when I should be doing other fucking constructive things. Oh God. I think tomorrow will be a disaster...I can forsee a trip to the hospital. Jamies on speed dial tomorrow incase I need him to order me some thai to replace the disaster I make. I hate you sometimes Jamie, and yet at others...I dunno. Why do you fuckers confuse me like this?!   Anyways... thoses are my thoughts.
