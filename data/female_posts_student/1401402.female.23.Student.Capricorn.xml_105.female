It was located at the San Francisco City Hall. It was a formal party, you know ladies had to be in an evening gown and the fellas, oh man the fellas was real fine with their suits on. I think that eventually bring out more attraction in guys when they are in a suit.   Once we got in, I was like DAMN!!!! Inside there were a main ballroom, a second, a third, a big ass chilling lounge, a vip lounge, and four fully stocked bar. I’ve got to say that it was one fine place to be at. The gallery was beautiful, and that stair case, oh man I couldn’t take my eyes off it. Everywhere you go, people are standing there associating with friends. It was pretty boring at first because no one was dancing.   After many many shoot I had to take before the count down, I was ready to roll. I was ready to get my groove, so ready to shake that ass. During the count down I was like, “WOO I Drank wayyyyyyy too much, and my birthday is almost over”.  I got a few punch here and there but it was a love bitch slap punch. I must say that it was one great night of my life, maybe because its my special day.    I was pretty surprised that a few good looking guys hit on me. But I didn’t see a reason for that. Why? Can anyone tell me why? Why am I holding back on every nice guy that comes my way?  Somehow I feel that I’m not ready for anyone. All that it really mattered to me was that my friends were there with me at the moment. Or maybe because I am so in love with Alyssia. I don’t want anyone to look down at me in any kinda way just because I have a kid (the future guy or his family).   To top it off I’m happy with who I am and Alyssia in my life. I’m still going strong and I’m loving it. WOO HOO I’m 23 now.
