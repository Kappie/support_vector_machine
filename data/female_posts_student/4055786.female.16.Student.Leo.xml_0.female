I started going to hawaii when I was 3 years old and I still am with my family. they take us every year for my dads bank vacation, my dad works at The Bank Of Willits. He rocks. I love to surf whenever I go there and I love to meet all of the hawaiian boys THEY ARE HOT. lol. Anway surfing is really fun, you should try it sometime. I go to hawaii every year and it is always a different smell different breeze and many different sound of the earth. It is great. Night time is so beautiful I can stay up all night and necer get tired. I always feel so far away in my own world when I am in Hawaii it is great. I dont have to think about anything important when I am there. Just GUYS. lol
