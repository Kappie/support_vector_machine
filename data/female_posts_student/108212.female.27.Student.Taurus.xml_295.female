By the way, do any of you guys have wishlists at Amazon? I was just wondering. Because I was thinking of linking to everyone's wishlists. You can tell a lot about a person by the kind of things that they want.    We went to see  Rollerball  this afternoon. It was pretty good. I love Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (also Mystique of  X-Men ) !  I still think Chris Klein is cheesy -- no matter what other people say. He's kind of sucky as an actor. I can't fathom how he's landing all these acting jobs.
