My sister is nine, my brother seven, and they each have their problems but we've gotten along much better since I decided to ignore them most  of the time.  My mom doesn't know about this blog, I don't want her to.  I don't think I care or even want anyone to read this blog.  If someone did, I'd love for them to send me an e-mail.  All my friends are fucking crazy and have almost no access to a computer. My best friend has begun a bike trip across California, to eventually end up in Mexico, where she knows no-one.  It's 9:40 as I write this, and our fragment of hurricane Charlie has still to run it's course. I read a charming article in the utne reader called either "how blogs ruined my life" or "how my life is ruined by blogging," but it was very funny, and although I believe pre-2000 utne is superior to current issues, It's worth  reading and you can subscribe to utne through their website. I've begun to read The Extra Man, about a gentelmanly tranvestite in new york who rooms with an eccentric elderly escort.
