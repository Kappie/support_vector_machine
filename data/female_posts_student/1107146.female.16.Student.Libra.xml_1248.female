It's all been said but I honestly just feel like not talking right now becuase I don't think I can truly be nice for awhile.  Hey.    First off, nothing I say in this email is meant as hostility and  what I say is an attempt at being respectful-I'm not sure if you'll agree,  though.     Next, I realize you've repeatedly told me a number of things. ex1:  don't complain. ex2: you've said in the past month or so to tell michael  the truth. ex3: a lot of people dislike me.     Now, I honestly haven't thought any of it for reasons I'll keep to  myself. (you don't need to know them and I don't wish to explain them.)  But it hasn't been until recently that I've actually weighed them with  the type of measure that they deserve. (Plus, no one has been out right  mean to me in a while, and I thought it was just another one of our  fights.)    All I'm saying is "you won" so to speak. I'll rethink how I act and  try not to complain, I'll try to be a lot nicer, and I already broke up  with Michael. I know you don't respect me anymore and I haven't decided  if that is truly such a bad thing. (De Nihilo nihil... a latin saying  means from nothing comes nothing. ie, i can't screw something up that i  don't have.) All I know is that if other people are mad at me then  something must be wrong. I promise I'll try, and that's a promise I am  making to you all.     The only thing I'm asking of you is this: If I'm going to attempt to  change my ways, I'm going to need to know everything that I need to  change. I'm giving you a blank slate here... write down exactly what you  dislike about me or what you think I ought to change in order to be a  better person. If you don't tell me what to change, then I can't change  anything. I'm not asking you to stop being mad at me. I'm not asking you  to stop insulting me everytime you see me. I'm not asking you to stop  making the comments to Mike. (As is I don't like anyone. I'm sick of the  same outcome, and things will never change. Bf/Gf life doesn't matter.  period. And I'm sick of skirting around like a little 6th grader in  puppy love.)    So, basically, here's your chance. You can insult me. You can laugh  at me. You can tell people I like them, even if I don't, and I'm not  going to do a thing about it. You can spread rumors about me. You can  tell others lies about me. Fact is, I'm done being angry with everything.  It's not worth it anymore. God gave us friends to cherish them and I  didn't, so now's your chance to repay that wrong. I was wrong and all you  have to do is tell me more of how so. I hope things can change between  us, and I'll try to be the best person possible. Sorry for not  realizing it earlier. Bye.   I just love how she accuses me of spreading rumors about her.....I love her....oh wait I don't.   Smile all, Life's just peachy keen. *sarcasm*
