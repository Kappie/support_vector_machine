It was so cool, i seriously think it's THE instrument for me. I always felt incredibly awkward holding a saxaphone or a clarinet, or sitting down at a piano- the other instruments i've tried- but i seriously felt normal holding a bass.  soundtrack- lostprophets  mood- decaffinated- in serious need of starbucks- but otherwise quite alright  ok i'm gonna go d/l the new vid for unholy confessions by a7x, i'll post again when i'm done watching it
