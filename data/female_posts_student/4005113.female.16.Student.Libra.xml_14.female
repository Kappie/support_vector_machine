It's  about chin-length, and layered around my face. Kind of like Morganna's, but not quite. :)  Awana starts on the 15th of September (I think), so after that I won't be seeing all of you every Wednesday. I'm still going to be in the leadership group thing, so I'm still going to be involved, but I'm going to miss seeing you guys (well, those of you who aren't in college ^_^) every Wednesday. But, I think I'll survive. I hope you guys do, too. LOL. I know you will. I'm not  that  necessary to everyone's life, I hope. :)  Well, got to go now. See you all later!
