I know my back still hurts and I have an MRI and therapy to go to, but I'm going to be optimistic and hope for the best.   The fact I have the most wonderful guy in the world who cares for me and is always there for me when I need him makes me want to fight and be myself again. I can't stay depressed about what happened. What happened is over and now it is time to go on with life and be surrounded by those who love me and want to help me in any way they can. It feels so good to feel this way again. And I owe it all to seeing my Davey's picture and hearing his voice :) I love you sweetie! I am the happiest girl in the world because I have you!    You're the center of adrenaline And I'm beginning to understand You could be the best thing about me
