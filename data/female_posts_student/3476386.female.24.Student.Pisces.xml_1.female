Troy*:  "What are you reading?" Sydney*:  "The Teachings of Don Juan." Troy:  "What's it about?" Sydney:  "It's about a Yaqui Indian from Sonora who takes a young man under his wing as his apprentice on a spiritual path in search of personal power and a deeper truth.  It's pretty good.  You should read it." Troy:  "No thanks.  I don't like Indians." Sydney:  (at a momentary loss for words) "You don't like Indians." Troy:  "No, I'm not really into that whole western frontier stuff" Sydney:  "This isn't about cowboys and Indians.  It's about a Yaqui man who lives in Arizona during the sixties." Troy:  "I still don't want to read the book."  later that day....  Marciela*:  "I'm having trouble trying to find someone with the right availability to fill the receptionist position.  The only people that seem to be applying are of Indian decent.  I wonder why?"  Sydney:  "Probably because the job posting board is in the engineering department.  I've noticed that a lot of Indians are engineering majors.  (Trying her best to be PC) Not to generalize or anything."  Edna*:  "It's true.  There's an upscale neighborhood up north that is densely populated by Indian people who are all primarily engineers."  Troy:  "I've never met an attractive Indian."  Marciela:  "Most people would just think about something like that.  But only Troy would just go ahead and say it."  *-some names have been changed to ensure the privacy of those involved due to the sensitive nature of this topic  **************************  Though some of you might be slightly horrified by what you just read, in a twisted way it's somewhat funny.  There really isn't a moral to this story, which actually happened.  This is more of a tribute to my old job, from which I was fired.  You see, I was a bit of a loose cannon; a real spark plug, as opposed to Troy* who was a real butt plug, and it cost me my job.  Luckily for me, I've found a new job.  But wouldn't you know it, Troy continues to work there.  Well God bless America.  In parting I say, so long, little office located at the local state university in San Diego, California.  So long Troy, you jackass.  You won't be missed.
