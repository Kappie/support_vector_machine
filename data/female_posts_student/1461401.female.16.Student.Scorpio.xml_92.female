After lilly and I are done here, we're going to go to the flower shop to pick up a nice arrangment to suprise mom with. I was kinda hoping to meet someone I know here, unfortunately the only people I've seen are Andy Schmidt and Nate Cheedle. If you're reading this now and I spelled your name wrong... hahaha. Like I really care. :-D There's a really cute guy at the register. He's usually here when I come, but I've never actually talked to him... oh wait... that's right. I have a boyfriend.... I guess I'm just still not really used to that... SORRY BEN!  Well... I'm done here. Time to get some flowers! :-D Kristin
