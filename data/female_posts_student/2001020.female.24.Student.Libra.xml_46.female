So I guess I've sorta been seeing someone new, first of all. He's Jewish, from Jersey, good kid. I don't know if I trust him completely but hey, it's only been two months and I'm not sure if it's really going anywhere. Um, what else? That's really what's new. I was in the front row for the Dave Matthews Band concert in Madison Square Garden...I made some friends in high places, yes I did! And the place went mad when James Brown came out on stage, so that was very exciting to be a part of. Anyway, I think I'm just being lame because I'm tired, so enjoy this entry till I feel enlightened enough for the next one!
