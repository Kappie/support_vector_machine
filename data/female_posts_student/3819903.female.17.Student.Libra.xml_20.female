Tony...of course, is always the center of anntetion wherever he goes, and hes hystarical to watch, but Greg is soo fake when he's up there!  Jenny was even embarrassed by him!  He just makes gay comments when they arent necessary, and ruins Tonys monologue!  Damn Greg!  And the Amps were on SOOOOOO high that you could barely understand the words mumbling out of Tony's Mouth!   So when the Concert finally ended, Nicole got a call from Kevin..."come to Gelatos!"  So she grabs me and we head on over to Divine Gelatos...the best Italian Ice Cream Place in town...well the only Italian Ice Cream Place in our tiny town!  We sit down and start devouring our international flava...and we make conversation.  I'm the conversation maker, even if I don't know the people very well, like in this situation!  Its Kevin, Nicole, Me, (kevins friends) Adam, Mike and Kelly.  Kelly, I knew from Middle School so i was chatting it up with her, and then Kevin and I started talking about golf, and then their friend Steve Mack shows up with his friend, Brendo, or Brenno..i dunno.  I know steve from Middle school as well, and this Brenno Character that I have seen at golf tournaments last summer.  So the golfers are talking...about golf, madison, tennis...and I'm trying to get Nicole into the conversation but she couldn't stay in it for very long.  I was comfortable with the situation, but i think thats where Nicole and I are different.  I can make conversations and she can't.  I knew she was uncomfortable when she started to laugh.  But I know that sounds weird, but I think they were "uncomfy" laughs; laughs to get her heard.  I guess I really dont know what shes feeling.  But after we left the guys and the south boys, we headed over the ginny's where she immediately asked me..."what did you guys talk about when you were walking back to the cars?" "he asked me what car was mine," and I described it as "the black Ford Escort ZX2, with the Titleist Hat rockin' the back shelf."  Then I got in the car.  Her immediate response was..."He likes you, and I'm fine with that."  Riiiiight!!  Sure!  I dont like him like that...He would be a cool golf buddy!  Thats all!  I dont understand her.  If you want to get his attention, you have to talk to HIM, and not be shy about the situation.  I didnt really talk much there once I think about it, i was just listening to their convos, and chiming in with my own comments here and there.  I hope she doesn't hate me, I don't mean to, its not like I can stop talking to people, its just my nature!   So at Ginny's we hopped in the door, and Nip/Tuck ended, and everyone left, it kinda sucked.  But then Abby was talking to Nicole outside, and I go out there to talk to them, and Abby's like..."Kaitlyn can you go inside for like 10 minutes cause I need to talk to nicole without you here?"  OMG can you say fucking High School Drama everyone?!  Holy mother of God!  Abby told me the other day that she needed to go up to LaCrosse to get her picture taken and that Kelly needed to too!  So she wanted to drive up, take the picture and come back.  Kelly on the other hand, wanted to stay at her campground, instead of driving 6 hours in one day.  So i was having a conversation with Kelly, and she was talking about this, and I said, oh Abby kind of wanted to come home right after so she could do some stuff with friends and just be home.  And Kel was like oh really?  Thats all, and i think she said to abby that I had told her that she said she wanted to come home.  And I got bitched out because "I need to think before I speak because it might hurt her feelings!"  Holy crap, its not like Im lying or something, and its not like its a big deal at all!  holy shit, why tell something youre not!  "oh kelly i'll sleepover, sure, even tho i really dont want to!"  I dont understand!  Tell People How You Really Feel!  I can't fucking wait til College!! All the drama will be gone, why can't everyone just be civil about stupid shit?!   WOW i have rambled on, about my gay night!  WOW, i think the last person i want to see right now is obvious, shes become so crabby since she started her new 9-6 job!  And lots of people have noticed too!  WOW, i dont care if people read this!  This is how I feel at the moment, and my opinions of people change all the time...so no need to get all huffy and puffy if i'm complaining about people, thats my fore-warning!  I was pissed tonight, and I just wanted people to read that!
