Sheesh. -_-' Well, with nothing to do, we went to watch Shrek 2, and it was funny...but somehow, i still prefer Shrek 1. And good news!! Donkey has donkey-with-dragon-wings children!! Actually, i find tt's kind of sick. Oh well. As i made my way home, i was wondering how i treated J yesterday. I felt that i gave him the wrong impression...when we met, i was like -blank- nothing to say lor, so i think in that awkwardness, i think i gave him the wrong idea that i'm arrogant or something...Oops...now how...hope things would be cleared up soon. Sigh...it's finally the hols but there's homework in front of me...can run but can't hide...i wish i was the fairy godmother in Shrek 2...so can "whiz" the homework away. Heehee.
