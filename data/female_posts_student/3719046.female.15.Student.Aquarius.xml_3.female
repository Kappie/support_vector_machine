There are only a few qualities a member of my club must have:  1.  You must at least hate your father, but both parents is also acceptable 2.  You must have an idea for what the club should officially be called 3.  You must be at least this tall to ride BATMAN 4.  You must be on my list of people I don't hate; I haven't yet made one in writing  Okay, so if you want to join my club, send me an email telling me.    Cfreak123@aol.com is my email address.  You blow.  Don't think being in my club makes you cool.  It totally does not.  But at least now I might wave to you every once in a while because I hate you less than I hate most people.  Good day to you.  No, screw that.  BAD day to you.
