My HK friend is soooo cute when he acts ! ^^v I loved the part when he said 'Alei... don't go' KAWAII !!!!! ^_______^ For the first kiss he put the paper infront of us and I am not sure how close he was to my face but it sounded close. Then the second one he put the paper infront again but this time made a slurping sound ! O_O wowowowowowo~  Anyways, our play went as we wanted it to and everyone liked it ^^  After our play I became sick X_X So, when I got home I wrote an e-mail to my HK friend about some things and congradulated him on his good work on the play ~ When I checked my mail today he wrote to me and hoped that I was better and so on ... but he also asked me if I liked him with or without his glasses (o^-^o) hmmm~  Well I am still a bit sick so I will rest now ^^ - alei ^^  (song) *Ai no Uta* by : Psycho le cemu  Ai no Uta  There will be hope !
