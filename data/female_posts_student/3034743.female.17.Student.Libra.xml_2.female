Bloggidy blog blog. I dunno. I talked to Josh on the phone for about 3 hours today, and it was nice. We talked about seeing each other (which we really need to do!) I am anxious for that. I just think it's really weird how everything turned out. I mean, we went to the same school for like a year and a half and we never once saw each other. It seems almost too surreal...but I believe everything happens for a reason, so yeah. We'll just have to wait and see how things go. To be honest I was a little scared about the '143' thing with Josh at first, but then we talked about it so all is well. Tomorrow is school and I'm glad. It will be nice seeing my friends again. I don't remember if I said that in my previous blog or not. Oh well....the handfull of people who actually read this are used to me repeating things by now. I don't really have much of anything else to say, so I'm callin it quits.
