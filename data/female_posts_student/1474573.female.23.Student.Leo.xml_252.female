And when they did vote, they voted for the WRONG person/people.    Okay, was it  me , or did it seem like the 2000 Presidential Election all over again?  What the fuck was that?!?    Sigh.  I think George and John are sweet, but COME ONNNN, this is a singing competition not some who's nicer competition!  And besides, the divas are nice too!  Fuckin' middle America and it's bullshit.  It's like deja-vu.  I should have voted.  Maybe my voice would have counted.    Sniffle.  Bye Jennifer!  I loved you when your hair was curly and you looked like you were wearing a spacesuit!!
