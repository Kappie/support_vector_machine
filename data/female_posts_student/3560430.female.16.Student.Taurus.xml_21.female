My reasoning is that if I get all the stew that is swarming in my head and just write it all down right now I should be able to focus and freaking well study my ass off.   Today was intriguing. I took That guy I was talking about before, aside and we had a conversation, but I"m not sure if it made him feel better or worse. My problem is I'm not nearly as good at talking to guys as I am at talking to girls. Maybe just knowing I care about him will help but I really don't know. He did allow me to replace a lot of my fear for him with anger at this ass hole Asian racist who dwells in my mandarin class, and with the help of his homies (you see he thinks he's black) teased me relentlessly. But that stopped. Because you see they weren't the major problem it was this other white kid and this little butt head named (I can't say because it is considered slander). They're horrid. They talk about my east Indian friends and call the sand N*****s of all things. I think that's pretty bad. I mean people go on about how the white man has like this whole racist, cultural biased thing going on but they seem to forget that there is racism in all cultures, the Chinese and the Huns were going at it way before the blacks and the whites were. I mean look at the English and the welsh, or the native tribes vs  other native tribes . Every group has their racist ass holes, and just because the whities seem to be getting more publicity about it doesn't mean we are the only ones.   Now that that is off my chest. You see this guy friend of mine was trying to defend a friend of his who is about a year or two younger and in turn got into a fight. But if he tells the office that he was attacked he'll most likely get expelled because he keeps doing stupid things. Not like really bad, but bad enough. My school has this thing where if you are in a fight that somebody else started (i.e. they attacked you) you may not defend yourself because then you are an aggressor. In other words they want you to sit and get pumled until somebody... An authoritative somebody... A teacher... Or something... Comes to help. Now this makes no sense. A persons not just going to stop hurting you if they attacked you because you played dead. That's actually a very good way to DIE. It really pisses me off too because this way the bully gets away with what he/she was doing. They get in trouble but so do you. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.   Bethie wrote about how imperative she and I make our rounds with all our friends. But I don't see how we can. It's such a tedious process. Sometimes I feel like I'm just meddling and not helping at all. And other times it's not like that. Other times I really do feel like my friends understand that I care. She also said I may cry when I get home. In fact she almost guaranteed it. Well don't count your chickens and all that. I was too tired to cry. I was too tired to sleep for heavens sake.   And now my carpal tunnel syndrome is setting in. Gnome just said that tylonal might help. I'll try that.   The only good things that happened today were that I got extra time to study mandarin and thus probably got an 80% on our last test. And I brought my poetpholio, and it was gorgeous. It took forever to finish though. I had a printer emergency, the first one I went to had no paper, the other didn't have word software, then I went back to the other which had paper, but I had to use the backs of used paper... Only to watch as, once my printing was done, a macki lacki came with real paper. I could have cried then. Of course I counted myself lucky after words when I went to English to find that my Court hadn't gotten any sleep... AT ALL! She's been up for about 48 hours now. So my motto today has been "well at least I got more sleep than Court." Sadly enough this kept me going.
