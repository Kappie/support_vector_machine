I promise I would have- why could'nt he just say something? But then again, I knew something was wrong.    He showed up at my door...  With a backpack and a "Hi". My first thought was he was there to see my dad- They usually talk about computers and stuff. But my dad was sick, he didn't want visitors. I'm so stupid! I wanted to ask what was wrong and I didn't.... and now I'm worried about him. His dad came looking for him a bit later- said he and his mom had a fight.     Omg, I'm such a horrible person  I could have helped him- said "Whats wrong?" But I didn't and now he probably hates me. He walked like 5 miles to our house!! WALKED. I'm a terrible terrible terrible person.     He's home now  But I'm still worried about how he's feeling. His mom must have made him pretty mad to make him walk all the way to our house. I still can't believe I let him leave.      :'-( I'm so sorry
