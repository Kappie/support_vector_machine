Transports me to the time when passion blazed like a fire on a cold, winterâ€™s night.     The misery in your eyes. The anger in your voice. The stagnancy in your hands. The bitterness of your lips. The foulness upon you. Opens my eyes and the truth hits me like the glare of the sun.    The remorse in your eyes. The sorrow in your voice. The tingling in your hands. The desire of your lips. The smell of your wounds. Overcomes my anger and lifts it like the wind lifts a fallen leaf.
