But in actuality, our minds are all controlled. We are brainwashed. Look at how much the media formulates everything we believe. Politics; we're subjected to biased telecasting and shows that let on only so much as they want to. People we respect and look to push their ideas on us and we soak them up like dogs. And not just politics. We're controlled in aspects of our lives we think make up our individuality. All these movies, songs, showes, pictures. This is your life! if you try hard enough you can be just like this too! so we do... Jesus christ i mean look at all of our expectations in ppl. We know how it goes. We know what your supposed to say and act. Actors reading the script of a perfect romance. It must be like that. Because thats all they ever show. So you have to say it like that... but its already been said...  So we look at people through a paper cut out. And if they dont match up around the edges, we can't even see the entire picture. We're waiting for something extraordinary to come around then, right? We've all come to learn that unless its perfect, its not good enough... it is all the media's fault. I mean come on! even the News Casters are beautified and wearing makeup and everything. But realising a fact doesn't make it go away. it's still fucked with your mind. Its out there.
