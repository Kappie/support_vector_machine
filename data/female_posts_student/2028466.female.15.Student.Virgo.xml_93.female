She opened it, then slammed it shut, and stormed back in the house.  A little later she came out of her house and again went to the mail box and again opened it, then slammed it shut again. Angrily, back into the house she went.  As the man was getting ready to edge the lawn, here she came out again, marched to the mail box, opened it and then slammed it closed harder than ever.  Puzzled by her actions the man asked her, "Is something wrong?"  The blonde replied, "There certainly is! My stupid computer keeps giving me a message saying, 'You've got mail!'
