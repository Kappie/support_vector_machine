Subject #1: Rodentz         ...hahahaha! Hide the cheese!?!? Honestly, just wow. I cracked up laughing really hard in Blockbuster when I saw this one.    Here's the description on the back of the case: " Walter and Professor Irwin believe their green miracle formula is the key to regeneration of damaged cells. But late one night, Walter starts to notice a change in some of the rats they used as their test subjects. Not only are the rats now extremely aggressive, but one has grown to 50 times its normal size, and it wants them for lunch. Don't miss this classic creature feature with all the makings of your worst rodent nightmare ."  ... to funny for words.  And as if somehow stumbling onto the horrible ruination of movie culture that is Rodentz I then also found:   Subject #2: Rodan        Wow... O_O ... Apperently, this movie was made in 1956 or something like that and is of course Japanese probably with horrible English dubbing. The worst thing is is that they are still making more movies like this. For example I just found out they are making Godzilla Save the Earth (2004) Coming 11/02/04 . Oh boy... November 2nd.... I just can't wait!
