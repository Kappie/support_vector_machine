I've realized I'm lucky to have friends that don't hurt me like you You tear my life apart slowly theread by theard until I'm left dangling in your mercy I'm like this to protect myself I'm like this to stay alive You think I'm like this 'cuz I don't care You thnk I'm l ike this 'cuz I act weird In truth you cause it all - it's 'cuz of you It's 'cuz of you I can't say or express emotions. It's 'cuz of you I want to die It's 'cuz of you I like - it's 'cuz of ou I hate   this one was written like 5 minutes before Slowly  Swiftly.  my mom talked with me that night, and really pissed me off, really really bad, so yea. i got really mad at her...as you can see, hehe
