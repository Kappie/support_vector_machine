John Turturro and Emily Watson star, with Stuart Wilson (I think).  John Turturro is quite brilliant as the introverted Russian chess master Luzhin -- comparable to Russell Crowe's John Nash in  A Beautiful Mind .  Although you never find out much about Natalia's past, Emily Watson pulls off a convincing character -- you can almost understand her attraction to Luzhin!  The movie is based on the book by Vladimir Nabokov set in the 1920s, and directed by  Marleen Gorris.  The book is a masterful study of a young man who became hopelessly addicted to Chess (psychologists would say due to the mental association it had with his beloved aunt), and was exploited because of his talent.   The film is quite beautiful to watch.  It actually reminded me of watching  The Man who Cried  (Sally Potter) a somewhat incomprehensible but nonetheless moving movie starring Turturro with Johnny Depp and the adams family girl (forgot her name).  Not because of the story line, but just because it flowed well, had a  European symphony kind of  atmosphere  and was a pleasure to watch.  Turturro also stars in  O Brother Where Art Thou?  a hilarious take-off of Homer's  The Odyssey  where you need to have the subtitles turned on because the southern american accents are so strong!  I think Turturro might be my new star (besides Johnny Depp) to watch out for.
