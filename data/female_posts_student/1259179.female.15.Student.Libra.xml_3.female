I started my day with trying to wake up my 4 year old and ended up in bed with her, cuddling, laughing and being totally silly. My day continued with a spring in my step, a smile on my face and a memory of my time with my baby girl.   This is a very important reason to get up in the morning and to rush back home from work at night, for the laughter of your children, the I LOVE MOMMY, the drawing that they specially made for you that looks like just lines to you, but tells a story for them. For me, they are my best cure for my depression. They helped me without knowing. They knew that mommy was not feeling well and put a blanket over me when I was just dazed and confused. Brought me their favorite dollies to confort me. I owe my new life to them and when they are old enough to understand what they did, I will tell them how proud I was of them for doing this.   It is a miracle to have a child, I know, but it is a priviledge to raise a child....DON'T ABUSE THEM, DON'T HURT THEM AND IF YOU DO, GET HELP.......   Have a great evening and ....Be good
