For four weeks I will be in Costa Rica doing community service in a village called Guadeloupe (could be Guadaloupe, not sure), rainforest trail maintenance, white-water rafting, and "roughin' it" (or so I thought).  I was looking over the packing list, and noticed that there was no need for a sleeping pad.  I thought this was quite odd, considering we would be sleeping on the floor of tents at some points in the trip... so I e-mailed one of the leaders.  Much to my dismay, she responded to let me know I didn't need one, becuase we would be sleeping in hotels while we weren't in Guadeloupe. HOTELS?!  I took so much pride in the fact that I had never gone on a "teen-tour" where kids stayed in hotels and shopped for 4 weeks straight.  I was excited to go camping, and have the same experience I did the summer before freshman year, when I camped and backpacked for three weeks in New England. MY DREAMS ARE CRUSHED. Now I'll be staying in hotels, sleeping in beds, and using toilets that have plumbing.  You would think that any other person would be happy to hear this news.  Well I'm not. I must go back to packing now.
