OMG, sharron and I had to go pick up balloons from Ben Franklin's before the party started, and we saw tracy at grounds! We were like... OH SHIT! Luckily we saw her before we got the balloons and she didn't see us get them but that was such a friggin close call. I think I stayed up till three but a couple people actually stayed up till six or something. Brian Eberly was there and he was being such a sweety! Nothing like a cute gay guy to really make you feel loved. :-D Tracy was totally surprised too. That was the best part. I think she was about to cry. Only a few people ended up staying the night though, so we all slept in one tent. We played truth or day into the wee hours of the night. I heard some very strange noises while I was asleep... but I'm not really gonna ask. Oh man. So tired. I think I have to go finish packing. Did I happen to mention how tired I am? Still though, totally worth it. And tracy liked the present I gave her. heeheehee. I love my friends. :-D Good night everybody! ~Kristin (I'll be back in a couple weeks! Try not to miss me too much!)
