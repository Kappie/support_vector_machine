He jumped on my bed and thudded around for a bit. He's getting really heavy! The only bad thing is if you move your foot under the covers he tries to jump on it! (Stupid cat) Then when he jumps off you hear this loud *thud!* Mmm he needs to go on a diet! Oh and Mango got a frog, ate it and left the legs! Whoops! Never a dull moment if you've got three cats! Heeey going back into relaxed mode. I'm a bit wierd actually (ya think?) listening to Lifehouse really relaxes me! It's like saying SUM41 put you to sleep. (Well they do with me!) They just sold out to pop, any way they're rubbish! My friend lovs them though and she's really excited that she's going to see them and it's like 'Umm whoo-hoo yeah, great...' So how is every one? What's every one doing? Mmm some one really should phone me cause I'm going crazy! It was hailing the other day and it covered the floor! Hmm it's too cold for school, lucky we got a week off. Recon we could go on strike?
