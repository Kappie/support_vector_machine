BUUUT...when i got home it was my b-day!! whoo hoo and i went to the DMV and got my liscense (well that little piece of paper thingy that u use until they mail the real one) and i had fun! the next day i had a party, which was awesome! i had soo much fun and i've realized that the Lord has blessed me more than i can ever imagine and i have the greatest friends in the whole world, and not everyone that i wished would've come, came, but it was awesome and i hope that everyone else had as much fun as i did...cuz it'd be a bummer if they all thot it was lame....nehoo after that (toldja it would be long) the fam and i packed up and left town to take one last vaca before my sister ships of to sac, and that was...interesting (we came home a bit early but...well we were done) we went camping in the santa cruz mountains and did some shopping and went to the beach and one night my some of my cuzins and aunt and grandpa came down for dinner so that was fun, o yea and did i mention my family is now experts on paint-by-number? wow, nother story, but ya, now i'm home and my summer's just starting cuz see i've been taking summer classes all summer and now they're over and i'm home and i DRIVE!!! and i'm looking for people to play with! wow this has been one of the best summers ever! i mean i thot last summer was awesome w/my missions trip and all, but this entire year has just been so wonderful! ----------------------end of first part of my journal thing------------------------------ now is the part about my thots and everything deep and meaningful so if u got thro all the chit chat of the "this is what i did" then u get to this part, which some say is the interesting part, but others don't so....ya summer's been just this time of reflection about this past year, and it's like i had soo much fun this year and so much happened and i'm worried about next year and that it won't be as good, or something and i dunno, it's just...i miss the way things were last year, i mean i can't even read my old blogs cuz i seemed soo happy, and it's like no matter how happy i am now it's not that bubbly, can't-keep-my-fingers-on-the-keys, just-gotta-scream, kind of excited and happy and then i decided that (like this song) I miss my friend The one my heart and soul confided in The one I felt the safest with The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again And let the light back in I miss my friend I miss those times I miss those nights I even miss the silly fights... and so the song goes...but THEN i decided that it's not really that that i want...i mean i don't want what i had, i just want my friend back ya no? i dunno it's weird, and then i think about camp and how they were talking about dating and waiting and i heard that barlow girl song about waiting and ya...it's just such a wonderful thing to think about doing, ya no, waiting for the right guy before jumping into a relationship, i think i'd like to be friends w/a lotta people, i LOVE friends, and they make me soo happy, and i don't need all the drama of life, i just wanna have some good, clean fun! cuz that'd be...fun! lol i love to blabber about stuff...i am really excited about school tho and it's comming way too soon, but it'll be fun to see people again and to get back into the rutine of things and i'm just all the way around excited but....well i was enjoying summer too, so....ya ...i dunno, wutev....i'm gonna stop rambling cuz i don't have anything else to say - changedfish
