I normally don't listen to it, and kind of look down on it because that's the CD that made AFI popular. But I can't help myself I guess. I know it's a stupid reason to look down on a CD, so I guess I'm getting over it or something. I'm listening to alot of AFI, actually. It's strange. I don't want to be obsessed.  Me and Sarah still aren't talking.  I got a phone call from the school today. They say I can't take SAT Prep because the only times it's offered is during my college classes and Latin III. So my choices were Ecology, Biology II, Desktop Publishing or PreCal.  PreCal it is. Ecology is stupid, Biology II has too many disections, Desktop Publishing is...I mean come on...Desktop Publishing. So I get two maths this year. I hate math. I don't really have to take Calculus but I know I will next year because if I don't take a math in senior year I won't remember any math at all when I go to college. I forget things too easily.  Go watch Vertigo. Now.     Music: Girl's Not Grey - AFI
