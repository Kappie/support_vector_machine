I am kind of scared to go through this MRI thing.  I am such a baby when it comes to getting treatment for me...lol...oh but I am okay with having babies.  How funny.  I guess because I know all the pain and hardwork of labor brings about a wonderful little person.  I love children and I hope one day Ed and I can afford to have another one.  I didn't think I would want four, but after getting pregnant the fourth time and losing the baby.  I think I realized that I do want more children.  It just isn't the time for them.  I guess I also want my parents to be surrounded by their grandchildren...but my sisters are taking forever to get knocked up...LOL  just kidding...but after seeing child birth first hand they have both opted to not have children...  Ed found out he may not leave in June, but in September.  I am mad about that because that means they would have to fly him out instead of him being on a ship for two months and in Iraq for 4 months.  He would fly into Iraq and stay anywhere between 6-9 months and then fly back home.  It is just too unstable in the middle east.  i want my honey to be okay...honey...oh he wants that DVD bad...hmm...I should get it for him.  Anyway, that is the boring blog of the day.  Hope you are all having a wonderful week.
