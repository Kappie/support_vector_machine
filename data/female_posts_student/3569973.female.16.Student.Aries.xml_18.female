Then we came home and went with his dad to go play golf at Cleburne....and well lets just saw I'm a rebel..lol..Friday I went up to Chicken Express and she was like well the job is yours if you want it, but then she also said that no matter what I would have to work on Fridays and then I would never see a single football game. So I was like hmm....and she said just call me and let me know what you wanna do, because if you want it you can have it. Well then I came back home and got real dressed up and me and Jake went out to the Parks mall to look around until our movie started. So we went and saw the movie, The Notebook. I cried!!! It could have possible been one of the best movies I have seen in awhile, probably because I can compare a WHOLE LOT to it. Then we went and ate at Burger King because that was all we had money for, but it didnt matter because it was the funnest stuff. Then Saturday we went to Fitzwaters birthday party which wasnt that much fun until the five of us got in the pool and played volleyball, which me and Jake won...lol. Then I had to go to work, but it was okay because I found that I get to close the store all by myself next Saturday. Its gonna be fun. Then Jake came and got me so we could go get something to drink, which I ended up getting a whole lemon since mom wont buy me any. Then we came here and watched this stupid show with my parents. Well then yesterday, which was sunday, we got up SUPER EARLY and went to burleson to look for tubes so that we could go to the brazos. So we went everywhere and then ended up going out to Mansfield to my dads house to find that he had some that we could use, but Jake still ended up buying himself a shamu and a paddle. LOL. So we got everything packed up and met up with Danielle and everyone to go. We got there and got in at about 2:30...well we didnt get back until 8!!! It took FOREVER! Then on the way back we just tied down shamu's tail so we were driving down the highway and he FLEW OUT!! So we turned around and got him and took some pictures. Then we stuck him in there with us and this is a huge shamu. So we stuck his head out the window and everybody was looking at him!! LOL. Then we went by the snow cone stand only to find that it had just closed and the Snow Cone Lady opened it just because we had a big shamu. I was sooo tired when I got home. I slept for almost 12 hours. So here we are. Now I just have to get up, clean my room, dust, and take back this big tube to my dad. Soo I think Im gonna go lay down for awhile...Till then, Later Days
