I DONT CARE!! right now, i dont care if i fail my GCSEs, im just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy :-D infact im SO happy, i stated squealing at my physics book for no apparent reason which made sister peer round the door cautiously and leave my room ASAP. now, i know the question thats on all of your minds (thats if anyone is actually reading this): why in the world is shivani so happy? am i right??...probably not, i mean this is me we're talking about. i am NEVER right :-( but anyway, in answer to the question....I HAVE NO IDEA :-D i REALLY dontknow why im so happy. i mean in home and away, dani ran kane (the guy who raped her) over after having kissed her uni lecturer AND scott may be about to dump her, oh and i reckon alex may be injured, poor baby :-( and then there's holyoaks, and everybodys being so MEAN to poor ellie. although, i guess lee's beginning to understand and hes trying to make dan understand too. and dannis little burst of friendship....am i missing something REALLY obvious here, or is she genuinely being nice to ellie??OH AND POOR DEBBIE AND DAN AND DARREN. darren got the crap beaten out of him, but dan rescued him, only to find out that his 'faithful' girlfriend had cheated on him with darren whilst he was in prison. although debbie was right, it should have been her forgiving him, seeing as he was the one who dumped her really harshly >:-(  and as if all of that DRAMA wasn't enough, I HAVE TO MISS THE ENGLAND MATCH :'( ITS NOT FAIR!! mother dearwums reckons i should be revising, which is probably true, but its not like thats actually gonna happen  OH NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CROATIOA JUST SCCORED...according to sister :-S she may be winding me up tho, so shall be back in just a minute. DAMMIT SHE WASNT :'( OH EBGLAND HAVE TO WIN!! and you know what, they WILL, because the KERAZY bunch from 11W are backing them up ALL THE WAY (WOOOOOH!!BUSTED SONG THAT :-D)  right, so after all of that pointless babble, i still ahve no idea why i was so happy...well ok maybe i do (but its all a bit hush hush right now....i think :-S naz/jane/alice is it??) but anyway, all of that random and depressing babble has made me lose the HAPPY vibe, and now im just plain BORED. nobodys online, probably cos theyre all watching the match like all sane people are; i've been listening to all my CDs SOOOOOO much over study leave that i've kinda gotten bored of them (WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!AM GOING TO BUY MCFLYS SINGLE TMRW :-D that shud keep me entertained for a bit)  WOAH!! commotion downstairs...has someone scored?? *creeps into parent's bedroom to check* ok no ones scored and the balls just bouncing ALL over the place! and WOAH, check out the FLOURESCENT goal keeper. maybe sunglasses were a good idea mrs beckham, but you REALLY should have gone to specsavers to get yours...the ones your wearing now are MAHUSIVE!!  ...alice reckons that if england lose it would be amusing...awful, but in a highly amusing way :-S that was a quote (just realised i couldve used quotations marks to make ms cobley proud, but ah well) alice is one weird girl...luvable, but in a weird way :-D  right, well i've run out of things to say to you darling bloggy, so i shall b a-retiring for the time being  CIAO xxxx
