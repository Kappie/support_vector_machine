Not like tomorrow, but the kids'll still remember one each other.     I had an issue today.  One that I haven't had since I was in high school.  You know how when you're chillin' in a room with a bunch of cool kids and you're all nervous and stuffin' cause you're so worried about saying or doing something and looking really dumb.  Well, it was kinda like that only they weren't a bunch of cool kids, not that they aren't cool, but they were three really intelligent people and I wasn't worried about looking dumb, I was worried that (as Robin commented) a bit of my true self would emerge and they would all throw up a little once they realized how dumb I am. (In case they haven't already.  Realized it, not thrown up.)  I don't really care when it comes to unimportant things, but I'd say one's intelligence level is somewhat important.  That's what I'd say!  So, Nikol, John, Ned, please don't think that I was being an asshole and isolating myself from you guys just..cause...I'm...an asshole.  I just get a little intimidated around smart folks.  To all who read this, THIS IS MY ISSUE AND I'LL HANDLE IT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES.  That's really all I can say on that.  I can fix it and I will.  Whether I realize I am somewhat intelligent or I read an entire set of fucking encyclopedias.  No, Mike, there is no such thing as a set of fucking encyclopedias.  Oh, wait.  Maybe there is.  Anyway, won't change by tomorrow.  So, I'm just hoping nobody thought (even if it was followed by a 'so what') that I must not like them.  Okay.  That's all.
