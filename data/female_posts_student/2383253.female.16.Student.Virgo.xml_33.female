I can't take this. Where are people when you need them at 2:13AM? Come on, seriously. Everyone was just a bitch tonight. This is not encouraging when it comes to being compatable with other human beings. I don't even know what I'm talking about. Leela, I need some more of your grief counseling. I also need sleep, water, and food. Someone please throw me a bone here.
