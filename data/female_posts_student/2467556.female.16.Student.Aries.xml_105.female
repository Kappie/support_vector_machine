HE TOTALLY OWNS COLORADO!!!!!! yeah, i know, stars lost 3-1.....but now who frickin cares? my niko scored a goal and we could lose the entire series now and i'd still be happy.  i think we all kinda knew we were screwed from the beginning.  Anyways, what now mr. VanRiper, my Niko does not suck! Brittany thinks that the reason Niko only scores on Colorado is to piss off Riku Hahl, his best friend who plays for the Avs.  Thats actually not a bad theory, lol.  Mike Modano was kicking butt a little bit too, he got in mini fights, which is abnormal for him. Basically, if we lose on Friday, its over and we should just play with an open net because we're not coming back.  *does victory dance* but my niko still scored!!!  school was pretty cool today.  I have this project for IPC where i basically have to copy down the entire periodic table.....sounds like fun.  Oh yes and friday through sunday i'll be in Arkansas visiting family that hates me.  oh joy!  I'll miss City Finals which determines whether we go to Metro 3rd or Metro Champs game.  its cool though, the day we go back to school its metro game in frisco!    Tonight, Coppell marches on for their 2nd state cup playing Carrolton/FB for the section championship and for a place in state.  i would also like inform the masses that the common misconception that "if we don't win metroplex, we don't go to state" is NOT TRUE.  if we win tonight's game, then we'll go to state no matter what.  period.  Metro doesn't matter at that point.  thank you for your time.  gotta go, i need a nap before the game.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
