I left there at like 4:30 and went by my mamaws and then I came home and mack came over, we went to eat at arby's and saw whitney, allison, and maria clever...fun fun....whitney rode with me and mack to my house to take mom me and macks leftovers...after that we all went to the high school for the stupid band meeting. We listened to the steel drums and the percussion, then watched the danceline and flags. After that we took whit to here g-ma's house and then me and mack came home about 8:45. At about 9 something we went to wally to pick out him some sunglasses and i had to get deo and some new mascara. After that we rode by the square, then to sonic and then to the square again, then we came home and he left....    Mack, you know I love ya! be careful on the hike. Dont think about me, it just makes things difficult. Call me if you geta chance to! Im gonna miss you, but Ill be safe, I promise. Thanks for saving my ass yesterday. I owe you big time.
