I actually woke up at 6.00am today. Went trekking with a couple of friends. 20km, early in the morning. That can really kill. And currently Im having flu+aching everywhere. Meet those peeps at bukit timah hill. Went up was utterly tiring, down was somehow pretty ok. After which, went to macrichite* resevoir. We went up the jelutong tower. While we were walking towards the tower, I imagined it to be like gorgeous and like ultimate. When we actually reach there, its like somewhat the army camp side tower. Im so disasppointed by that. But nevertheless, we went up and had a great view of s'pore. Ha. Surprisely, we were able to see the changi airport and some planes flying by. -reminds me of my brother- ok, forget it. Then we continued our journey back.. Whole journey was like 11km, cuz we went round the periferal area. Was dead beat after day. Oops, I forgot to update this. On our way back, as we were walking. I stepped on an armani sun shades. Wow, its like damn cool. Looks like those oakley type. Stylish. Hee he, and we decided for ourselves that it should belong to us. Founders keepers, losers weepers. hahaha.. After the long trek, we went to Hans for lunch. Lunch was filling and great. Somehow, the food tasted damn nice. Ha. It muz be due to the tiring trekking.  Ok, that is all for today. Oh, went to study in the afternoon. At least, I did something. Ha. Im goin to bed. Too tired already.Tomorrow, tuition early in the morning. The thought of it makes me wanna zzzz.. Off i go, bye guys..  Shall update only on days when im free.. Or maybe when something interesting crops up. Bye for now.. -drops dead-  this post is written a few days ago.
