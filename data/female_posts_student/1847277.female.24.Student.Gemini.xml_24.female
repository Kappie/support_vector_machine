Picture starched suits and slicked back hair.  But it wasn't so bad.  I've learned to deal with bluegrass over the past four years.  And it makes Matt happy when I go with him to shows.     I got my new computer today, but by the time I got home, I had to start with dinner and then went to the show.  My enthusiasm has also waned a tiny bit as I realize that I really know nothing about how to use a Mac and thus there's definitely going to be a learning curve.  I just want to figure it out quickly so I can start playing with my new iPod!  Can anyone tell me why cats like to chill out in bags so much?  Or is this not normal kitten behavior?
