Haha, he came over last night and we watched The Butterfly Effect (what a great movie!) BUT before all of that, we were discussing Kidz Bop and how we are so pissed that they try to sing yellowcard and blink 182 songs. They sing "i miss you" and justin was demostrating how they sing and it was the funniest moment of ever. The way he sang "Catching things and eating their insides" was astronomical. wow, what a vocabulary word. usually my vocabually consists mostly of the words "i'm sorry..." -what an upgrade. I looked at a few colleges online today. They were pretty cool. Then i looked at their standards and most of them said that they take only applicants that were in the top 15% of their high school class. I'm definately down in the loser section! POO! Embry Riddle Aeronautics university in daytona beach looks like the best bet so far. Disneyworld, manatees, the beach, hot guys, dont have to travel for spring break. Sounds good! I love Gavin DeGraw. I've been listening to his music all day and probably will continue until forever. Well i'm gonna go try to find somethin to do. byebye. ::Oh, this is the start of something good, don't you agree?::
