Last night was a night to remember. In a good way of course and thats how it should be. Its over and thats a heartache to remember. Somehow I dont feel connected to him anymore. I've lost it. Somehow it doesnt click but we end the night with this magnificent powerful kiss that sweep me away. To me it really meant Good Bye with a Thankyouverymuch for all the pasted excitments.   LoL, its funny how I would get this really bad bad toe cramps. Its a habit of nervousness when I'm around him. I told myslef not to be nervous because his nothing to be afaird of but I couldnt help myself. And my speech, Oh my gosh! What has he done to me? I felt like I was speaking ebonic language. Thats bad, really bad. He mustta be laughing at me by now. I wonder if I would ever get toe cramps around other guys? Maybe not because there isnt anyone that I'm interested in.   Guys, they come and the they go. New guys in my life are very similar to new favorite songs. I'll like that song for a longterm or short terms until I get sick and tired of it. After that theres a brand new one along the way or on the side. I'm very wicked and cold hearted that I must say.   I peel a grilled shrimp and my fingers was dirty so I said, "Can I WASH my fingers on your shirt?". Way to go, I felt so clumsy. What I meant was, "Can I WIPE my fingers on you shirt.". There was some other stupid stuff I said or did but never mind about that. Yeah lets forget about that.   Oh, but lets talk about the very first time I've learn how to cook rice. Yeah yeah that should be interesing. I was about 8 years old, a hungry lil girl. Mom was sleeping, didnt want to bother. I climb onto the counter and cooked some rice without adding any water to the pot. And end up burning myself. That was sad and funny, fuuny sad. Oh, the first time I've fried some eggs I didnt use any oil. I'm pretty clumsy huh?
