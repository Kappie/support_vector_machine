We have already acquired.... umm.... *looks up new total on excel spreadsheet on laptop* 1265 coal, which is alright for a start, but we should have at least 3.5k by the end of Sunday. That's our goal, 3.5k coal by the end of tomorrow. I'll be working, will you?   Bonus: I sold the 5k coal to the second guy. Current payment for each member on this order: 210k
