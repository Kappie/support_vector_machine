It's Cassandra (hehe, Leslie), just wondering what's new with everyone...there hasn't been a new post in several hours and I am beginning to worry about the health of some of us (coughs, Jess).  Please, may I (we) suggest, that you do not do any more lengthy "instructions" type posts for a very long time.  Unless it has an instruction on how to (cough, cough), because you met your hot geek, please no lengthy posts Jess.  No important relevance to posts, should be banned from our "girls just wanna have fun" stress on the "fun" part.  Lol.   Kidding, but seriously no more technical crap....we all read the whole thing and by the end my eyes hurt...cries, and of course still oblivious to everything in the aforementioned post.  Anyways, i'm done blathering...this post is becoming very much like "instructions."  Byes!!!  Les.
