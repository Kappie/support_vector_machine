Yes, and the scarier part, we hadn't talked since 10:30 that morning, with no clothing disscussion at all.  We came dressed that way by pure chance...or the twin thing we've got going.  I think thats a good sign that we spend way too much time together.  So, I got a new bed set!  It's really cute...well, cute is not a good word there, more, better than it was.    Technically I don't think Ryan entered the Sanctuary, therefore God's wrath wouldn't have been implored to him because that is the holiest spot in the chuch.
