Turns out I can't go back to school because of some unexcused absence and they think I'm ditching..yeah a whole absence, wtf. So mom called bitched me out, then my dad decided to just not get in it so I had to sit home all day and do nothing. I talked to Clint and I felt kinda bad cause it seems like I'm always telling him I can't do things but it's cause I'm never really allowed which sucks. My knee feels like it's getting better but looks like it's getting worse, don't see the plus in that. Today was the softball tournament in Simi Valley which I didn't go to, hope we won. Seriously over all this stupid drama between everyone, seems like theres maybe 5 girls on the team tops that are just chill and cool the rest out of the 14 are just bitches( and if any softball girl sees this and gets mad cause I'm "talking shit" GET OVER IT IT'S THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT)...so yeah. I miss summer vacation and goin to the beach and surfing with Clint, everything was so perfect, especially going to the fair with him and all my friends. For those few months I actually forgot about everything that brought me down and had the time of my life. I'm really missing the days when I was back in 6th grade at Hollywood Beach School, where I had Carlye as my best friend and her mom was alive, Carlye and I would go to the beach every weekend for hours from when we woke up till sunset, and everything we did for fun wasn't going and getting drunk or high. I feel like I have a shitload on my mind but don't even have the words or time to put it all out. Well I'm gonna give Carlye a call and take a walk on the beach to calm down. OFFICIALLY STRAIGHT EDGE...and then I woke up huh Deanna lol.    Always and Forever known as DanieLSD
