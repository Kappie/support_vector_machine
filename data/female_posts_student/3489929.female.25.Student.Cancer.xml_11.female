I want to warn her that this job will suck out her soul and leave behind an empty, bitter shell of a human being. I want to point to myself and say, "Hey, New Girl, take a look at what YOU'LL be five years from now if you stay here."  Oy.  In the arena of good news, I am only 20 bucks away from winning a Gazelle machine at work in the incentive program. By next week, hopefully I will have ordered it. Yippee. Only thing I have to look forward to this week.  Not happy about the birthday coming up. I have this innate fear that everyone will either forget or not care enough to get me diddly shit. After all of the birthdays I have helped compensate over the past year... I'd better be getting some good diddly shit.  I don't do it just to make sure I get gifts on my birthday- though that is a major part of it. People (i.e. management) at my job just don't take the time or have the inclination to help people celebrate it. I always make sure I have a card and some little trinket or bauble to give to everyone- at least, those I know and care about within the company- on their birthday. To make them feel good. Appreciated, even.   They'd better remember me. Or come birthday time, I will be pissed.  I am turning TWENTY-FIVE. That is a quarter of a century. Two and a half decades. I am fucking OLD. And nowhere where I thought I'd be by now.  I have spent the past seven years of my life on a derailed train hurtling towards oblivion.   I seriously think I must have broken a ton of mirrors in 1997 to be where I am today.  At least I'm finally trying to get back on track.
