She understands how frantically I want to walk on each continent, the languages I want to speak, the lives I want to live. So she gave me the world.  I was in full tears tonight as I told her how unmendable my heart will be when some man marries her away from me. When they have beautiful babies and plant trees and flowers in the yard of a cozy home--how I'll plot to burn it down, just so I can call her at three in the morning and talk to her til six, and not worry that someone is stroking her thigh, fitting himself into the crease of her buttocks and whispering into her ear that she hang up and let him love her back to sweet dreams.  Any of these things could, will, I'm certain, happen to either of us. Just because I am so resistant to the idea of there being a constant man in my life, I'll probably be the one who succumbs (gives in, loses myself, becomes a typical woman) first. And she will ache for the best friend she's ever known. Or I will ache for the best friend I've ever known. No matter. Her or me, one of us will mourn the loss of the other first.  Soon. Because that's what happens when women of a certain age graduate from college and go forth into the world.  They mate.   They procreate.  They become trapped.  They are never as wild and free and brazen and...  loud...  ever, ever again.  My God, I don't want to lose her...and yet...I know the way of things.
