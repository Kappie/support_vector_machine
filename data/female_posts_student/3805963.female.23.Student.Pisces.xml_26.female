On my way back to work I saw a homeless man on the street with a sign that read 'Anything will help, even if it is only a dollar.' Well, all I had was a dollar on me and was feeling charitable so I pulled over in a grocery store parking lot and ran across Dodge to give it to the guy. All the sayings of saftey and girls being tormented that my mother has told me over the past 23 years ran through my mind, yet I was on a mission to give this poor homeless man my dollar. I get there and hand the guy my buck, apologize I dont have more and turn around. He yells at me to wait. I see the zooming car run past my nose then turn, smile and say thanks. He grabs my hand bends down and kisses it. I'm astonished and a little grossed out but hey, he doesnt exactly have a bath and a toothbrush. But the thing is that he wont let go of my hand. I know Judo, I'm a black belt, I'd feel guilty about beating up a homeless guy but ya know I really wouldnt care. I tell him to let go first I think that you should warn everyone before breaking thier noses and kicking them in the nuts. But before I can even get out, 'Let go of me or I'll beat you senseless.' he starts jabbering about steaks and shrimp. I tell him again that all I have is a dollar. He points to the grocery store and says a dollar doesnt buy much these days, he wants a steak. I'm bewildered, I cant beleive that this hobo wants me to buy hima bloody Bew Yourk Strip! If I buy anyone else a New York Strip I better be fucking them, and I dont have sex with people who dont bathe regualarly. I get my hand back, he places my dollar back in it. I tell him my long story about how my credit card wont accept anything but ciggarrettes or gas. (I know laugh it up. My bank is ghetto and my card declines at random intervals. Its annoying but I just take heart in knowing I have the only credit card with a personality.)I give him my dollar back. He starts to get angry, he wants a steak. I tell him to save all the dollars that he gets and he can buy his own steak. He gets pissed. I ask for my dollar back. I get it, flip him off and run back to my car. You know, I wasnt exactly wanting a big gush of emotion over my puny little dollar, I wasnt even wanting a thankyou from schizophrenic homeless men but that was just a little too much. I mean the sign said any money, even a dollar. Really its false advertising, I should sue for his box. I head off to work wondering how to summons a homeless man to court.  When I get there I buy myself a Mountain Dew with MY dollar, see still works for little stuff, and head in. Here I see the freshman class for Creighton University, dressed in the lastest fads, hair sleek and shiny apparently not homeless.  I got an email from the President of the University today to treat these future lawyers and doctors well because they are the highest of their classes with the best SAT's and honors (they are also paying the most since tuition just raised by 5,000 dollars). These future doctors and lawyers however are smooshed together in a big circle jumping up and down and shouting out the words to TuPok and Ja Rule. Its quite comical because half the songs their belting out actually say how much the singer and the ghetto peeps want to shoot them and take out their liver.   Thier probably all Republicans too. I hate republicans just like I hate spiders. Simply out of neccessity and reason.  Have fun - dont kill yourselves  Ackron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!
