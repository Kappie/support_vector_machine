So, since I had a bill to mail, on the way to get lunch, I stopped by a mailbox in a shopping center.  Unfortuntely, as I pulled up, I noticed the Oldies station PT Cruiser parked nearby.  Actually, they were sorta blocking the mailbox.  The event played out as follows: As I leaped from my parked car to try and throw my bill in the bin, this scrawny boy thrust a Coke can into my hand. Scrawny boy: how about a free coke? BunHug:  Um.  Ok.  Thanks. As I threw myself back into my car and sped off, I noticed them watching me go.  Did they think I realized on my way to get my free coke that there was a mailbox nearby, and that I had just been waiting to mail a letter?  Do you think they realized my ploy to get a free can of coke with no intention of listening to the station in my free time (we actually listen to it at work)? And anyway, who goes to a live radio spot to get a free coke?  Thanks again Brian  Levy, the interns.
