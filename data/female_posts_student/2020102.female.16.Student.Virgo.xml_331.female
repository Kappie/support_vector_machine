Josh: (automatically) No. James:  Why  do you do this? Josh: Cause you said you wanted it. (later, still trying to decide) Ms. Ferguson: We could cook… James: Right. I’d like to see us cook a real meal instead of frying up a tortilla with cheese on it and saying “we’re making omelettes!”  Sarah: What’s your email address? Brandy: I don’t remember. Sarah: How can you not remember? Brandy: You have to have a brain to remember stuff.  Girl: Only six more hours until lunch. Alex: “Only” six more hours. Girl: Well I’m used to eating at 10:30 except when I have choir. Alex: I know. I have choir with you. So I “suffer” just as much.  “It’s not like it’s ‘oh, it’s Saturday night, no one goes out, I’ll see you in a minute.’” -Barbara while we were making homecoming plans  (at a DU basketball game, Kris and Mark are watching the band and making fun of them) Kris: Look, I can play the tuba. Mark: It's not a tuba, it's a sousaphone. (a few minutes later, Krystal and Whitney are checking out guys on the team and saying their numbers whenever they are on the court) Krystal: Hel-LOW, 43! Whitney: No, it's like "cel-LOW, 43!" Krystal: Cel-LOW, 43! Mark: It's not a cello, it's a sousaphone.  "I have candy, little girl!"  -Erin when she pulled over to offer me a ride home  (I know this one is in here like four hundred times but it makes me laugh every single time so it's going up again) "They were talking about premies and then they were talking about dogs, but I didn't realize they had changed topics so it really freaked me out when they were like 'then we had it at home, and it was vomiting and peeing in its kennel.'" -Alex overhearing some teachers before Prayer Club  (At Blockbuster) Austin: Is that Cate Blanchett? If it is, we’re getting it. Sarah: Why, do you think she’s hot or something? Austin: No, I think she’s a good actress, I’m not so shallow to just buy a movie because a girl in it is hot. (later) Sarah: (sarcastically) Oooh, how about this one? (picks up “Avril Lavigne: My World” DVD) Austin: Eww, no, she’s ugly.  "Hi, my name is Erin, and... my favorite color is clear... because it goes with everything!" -Ryan after Erin said something really stupid  "It's a little loud... I can't hear the person I'm trying to talk to." -Jake (right after a lecture the teacher gave us about paying attention to the movie and not talking)  "Oh yeah, I forgot I have to slow down here because there's a huge dip. It's really bad for your shock absorbers if you do that, I feel like I'm off-roading, only it's urban off-roading." -Alex when he was driving me home  "do you wanna see him? he's so cute. i said 'oh my gosh.' oh my gosh look at him! gee, i wonder. yes, he is. ahhhh look at him. die. jamie howie. oh my god! oh my god! look at him look at him (repeat like a million times) that is a hot picture. so she likes transvstites? marc, what was our idea? i know it was really good. i forget too. yeah, i thought we were going to do the countries thing. okay. oh and what was that historical figures thing. what was that about? okay. (says something to katie that i can't hear) ...underneath the story... don't do that. please don't send this to me. i really don't want it. don't i'm comfortable. no. NO. whaaaaaaaaaat. i hate french. you know what matt is doing to me now? (talks about how annoying matt is) it takes me like an hour to get out of bed. i can take a shower and do my hair and put on clothes in like five minutes. i need your pen! let me borrow your pen! (sticks pen in sarah's face and then sticks it in her hood like a really annoying person) look. this is where i cut my finger off, almost. it hurts, really bad. two days ago. i was cutting this tomato like this and it went like phwwaah, and i cut my thumb." -another Erin rant  Tahoe: I heard they found a bomb threat in the bathroom, but our school doesn't care about us enough to tell us what's going on.  Corey: Tahoe. If someone blows up the bathroom, all that's going to get broken is toilets.  Blake: (to Erin, backstage after he just did one of his solos in Carousel, which he is Billy Bigelow in) Did you hear my sour note? Erin: (thinking he just said "did you hear my song") Oh, yeah. Blake: What? Erin: Wait, what did you say? Blake: Did you hear my sour note? Erin: Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.  Blake: I really wish I could have hit that sour note better. Little kid who plays Mr. Snow's son: Oh I heard your song! Which of the sour notes was it?  "This is the ice tea story. Once upon a time, there was a guy who was thirsty, so he got some water and mixed it with some high fructose corn syrup..." -Erin reading the Nestea Ice Tea ingredients to us at lunch  (after I said something he said made no sense even when he tried to rationalize it) Austin: I just think on a very high level. You don't think on the same level as me. Only poets, scientists, and... writers of all kinds... think on the same level as me. Sarah: So, I'm actually a writer. I write in a journal. All the time. (pause) Austin: That's not really a journal. Sarah: You're right. It's actually the list of people I'm going to kill.  (while playing SceneIt!, according to Mark, his team is Team Awesome and Sara Bibb's team is Team Horrible) Sara B.: What team are you on? Sarah: I'm... on whichever team is winning.  Sara B.: You're on our team. Mark: No she's not, she's on Team Awesome.  Sara B.: No, she's on Team Horrible! Kyle: (to me) She just called you horrible.  Melanie: Smith! What should I write in my bio for the play program?  Smith: Say you come from a long line of homo sapiens. Person standing next to Melanie: I thought your parents were married!
