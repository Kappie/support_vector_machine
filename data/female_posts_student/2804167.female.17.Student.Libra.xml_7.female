Nevertheless they were indoors, enclosed by a sheath of old grey wood that was only as high as they were. Above this were clean windows, to let in the light. I don't believe there was a ceiling.  I hurried through them; I had to escape. They had come for my parents, and detained them even now, but before they came my parents had told me quickly: "Go, you can evade them if you are crafty. You must carry forth the business. We are lost." I hid beneath the flowers, but still they rustled with my movement. I was forced to hold myself at odd angles, to avoid the stems and still touch only my feet and hands to the dry ground.  They searched and searched the house, but this little alcove was safe from their efforts. Either they did not know that it was here - could not find or see it - or they did not expect it to be a viable sanctuary. Whatever the reason, they did not seek me out. And when the moment was safe, I squirmed from among the tall plants and broke free of the wood enclosure.  I fled into the street before the house. I thought that I was safe now, I had made it to the open, and I stood tall in the cloudy light. But he was waiting for me there. Stepping from a car which I had thought was empty, he caught my wrist in his vastly larger hand.  "Let me go," I gasped. "I can't do that. You know I can't," he replied, cool. "You will not force me," I said. I would fight him. For my parents. He pulled me closer, yanking me by my captive wrist. His aviator sunglasses loomed over me, and his khaki bomber jacket made him enormous and imposing.  I pulled the boxcutter from the backpocket of my jeans.  "Do not force me," I hissed. He held me tighter. Slipping out the blade with a quiet snick, I forced it under the elasticised knitted cuffs of his coat. I slashed viciously through the veins of his wrist. He shouted, but still he did not release me. Again I cut his wrist, viciously, as desperate as a cornered animal. I  would  escape- he would not rob my freedom from me. Over and over I dragged the blade through his skin, cutting through his cuff now. I felt the crunch against his bones, the scraping and ripping. Even now the phantom sensation haunts me.  "Jenny-" he said, holding his wrist and falling to his knees. He had released me.  Coldness. It was him. I knew him now. Always he had dreamed of astronautics, but here he was now, a mere policeman. I was cold. I had loved him once- loved- and I had killed him. I. Was. So. Cold. I whispered his name before I could think. He was reaching for me. I shrugged him off and ran. I had killed him and I was cold. I ran - for my parents.
