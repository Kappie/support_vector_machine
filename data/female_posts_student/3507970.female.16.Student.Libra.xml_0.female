Chorus   Captivated by the way you look tonight the light is dancing in your eyes  Your sweet eyes ,  Times like these we’ll never forget ,  Staying out to watch the sunset ,  I’m glad I shared this with you ,  You set me free ,  Showed me how good my life could be,  How did you happen to me ,  Yeahhh aww   Verse 2   And then I’ll swing you girl until you fall asleep ,  And when you wake up you’ll be lying next to me ,  We’ll go to Hollywood make you a movie star ,  I want the the world to know how beautiful you are,   Chorus   Captivated by the way you look tonight the light is dancing in your eyes  Your sweet eyes ,  Times like these we’ll never forget ,  Staying out to watch the sunset ,  I’m glad I shared this with you ,  You set me free ,  Showed me how good my life could be,  How did you happen to me ,  Yeahhh aww   Verse 3  There are no secrets anymore,  Nothing we don’t already know,  There are no fears of growing old ,  We’ve got no worries in the world .
