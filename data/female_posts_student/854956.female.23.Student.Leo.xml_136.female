Things have been going pretty well, aside from me getting sick, but I'll talk about that later.  Firstly, I've been doing well in all my classes... thankgoodness..!  I'm pulling A's in all my classes so far.  And, that's good because it IS the midterm right now... so, this gives a good suggestion of how the semester can turn out.  :-)  Um, there has been a bit of heartache this semester already though.  :-(  My Exceptionalities professor (Exceptionalities is about kiddos that are in special ed... except they are now referred to as 'exceptional') has had a really rough semester.  Okay, about 3 1/2 weeks ago (now) there was an elderly woman that was the victim of a hit and run accident.  She was killed.  This was my professor's grandma.  She had been giving us updates every now and then because there were a handful of us that wanted to know if they caught the creep that killed her grandma.  Anyhow... Last Friday (26 Sept) we're all sitting in class waiting for her... and we know she shows up a bit late on Fridays because of one of the field experience programs she's involved in (kids from the Reddix center come over for a "buddy program" to hang out with college kids... they find it really fun... these are high school aged exceptionals)... anyhow... about 15 minutes has lapsed, and we all start getting a bit worried, especially when those in the buddy program tell us they didn't see her.  So, we think "Well, maybe they caught that jerk..."  No... she comes by the classroom, and one of the students goes out to talk to her, especially since she was in tears out there.  Well, it turns out she had just gotten a call that morning that her grandpa (husband to the grandma) had passed away.  Needless to say, class was cancelled that day... and has been every single class meeting after that.  Anyhow, I've been praying for her and her family... that's a horrible thing to go through.  Next, there are many with questions about Greg and I.  Even I have questions about that... so don't ask anymore... when I get it all sorted out, I'll let ya know.  Right now I'm just really enjoying hanging out with someone.  I really don't click with people in a way where I could see myself being friends with them forever, and he's kinda the first person probably since Melissa that I've had that type of click with.  Anyhow, he and I are probably going to Mr. Sinus with Ricky and Melissa next Friday... :-)  Should be a great time, since I haven't been to Mr. Sinus in forever!  Okay, and now I'll let everyone in on my sick day.  Early Friday morning at about 2am, I woke up feeling really sick and spewing the contents of my stomach out a few times... I couldn't even keep water down.  I knew this was bad... and quickly decided I got it from one of the kids.  Ya see, about 3 kids in MY group alone had been gone at one point and time during the week... home sick with a stomach virus.  Okay, so, I really didn't get sleep between 2 and when I had to leave... I mustered up the strength to get to my computer and email my music prof to let him know I wouldn't be in lab that morning.  But, I still had to go on campus... because I had my communications midterm yesterday.  I think I probably got a B on it... I knew the stuff... but I was sorta out of it, and really weak.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  That is the first time in my life I had to stop about 3 times on the way from my class to the car and sit down to gather up energy to keep going.  Well, anyhow... I got home and called Greg.  He told me to stay home and to "feel better soon..."  He also told me to give Andre a call and let him know.  So I did... and I was glad I did, because I was still getting sick after that.  I was glad that I was able to doze off a few times, too.  So, anyhow, I'm finally feeling better.  I took some of that medicine that you take every 15 minutes for an hour to stop nausea and all... I guess it worked, because I feel fine now.  It's just me and Kathy at the house... my parents and brother went to the golf tourney.  They'll be home later.  If I feel well enough, maybe Kathy and I will go to a movie or something later.  We'll just see... gotta make sure I wouldn't be ralphing.    Anyhow, that's all for now... I'll try to make more of an effort to post updates in the future... My next update will most likely be next weekend... especially if Greg and I go to Austin to see Mr. Sinus with Mel and Ricky... :-)
