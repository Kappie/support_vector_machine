Well, first of all, I didn't feel like making a new template but wanted a change, so I'm sure you see that effectiveness taking place. My blogback comments don't count on here, so comment and pretend to like me if you don't. Secondly, school started again, and I am beginning to return to misery again.      Today was ignore-Francesca day. And then eventually yell at Francesca day. But I'm okay.       The AP English work load is already looking evil, and economy is retarded and evil. This will be fun. But I'll just keep trying to think that this will be a good year, for it has potential to be a good year.     I went to the cardiologist the other day, and he told me I should start drinking less coffee so as to improve my chances of escaping the plague that is high blood pressure that runs through my family. I have been needing coffee lately-- not for pleasure, but to stay awake. We'll see how this will turn out.      I think that's really all I have to type on here, really actually. Miscellaneous stuff has been going on, and Ale's moved out. Randomness every where. Eh. Such is life. It happens. Stuff happens, and I'm not sure why I find it oh-so-fascinating to keep track of nothing here.       The wind blows through and bellows and sings and all that fun jazz, and I'm not swept away in any literal nor figurative way. Maybe because there isn't much wind blowing, anyhow.
