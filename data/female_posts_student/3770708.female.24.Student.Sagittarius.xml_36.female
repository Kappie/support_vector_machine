Gordon Beirsch, the maker of Mike's favorite beer, was our destination. We mulled over the dinner menu for some time before opting for just beer and pupus. I helped myself to unlimited refills of their divine home-brewed root beer and dutifully demolished the calamari while my mother and Mike had enormous, frothy beers plunked in front of them. Mike went in favor of the dark "Dunkles" beer, my mother stuck with the MÃ¤rzan. Four pints later, Mike had sampled most of the flavors on the menu, including the "seasonal" beer, rich in rancid banana goodness. Gavin ate a plate of buttered pasta, and then he and I explored the courtyard. Gavin stroked the bronze sculpture of a little hula girl, and engaged me in a thrilling game of "skidoo", aka "jump off the curb", for about half an hour. We browsed the art gallery, and Gavin stared deeply at the paintings, pointing out the moon, water, and trees for me. I checked in with the drinkers, happy to see them laughing with the Rockland-born waiter.  Mike becomes much more masculine as he drinks. His polite posture slumps comfortably, he cocks his finger in a "how you doin" gesture, and he flirts confidantly. It was refreshing to see him having such fun. At the end of the evening, I hopped in the car as the designated driver, and we cruised on home, singing loudly to the classic rock station as Gavin snoozed soundly in his car seat. Safely home, we sat in a stupor in front of "The Princess Diaries" until falling soundly into bed.  This morning, I woke to hear Gavin telling his grandma "I go get mama". Smoosh went my heart, and I leapt out of bed to swoop him up in my arms. The peace was momentary, as I was then faced with the uncomfortable task of devising a way out of babysitting Chris as my auntie and my mom went shopping. Gavin helped me greatly by sitting naked on my mother's bed and peeing through all the layers of her bedding, necessitating a trip to the laundromat. When Beth and Chris arrived to pick up my mom a short while ago, I smiled inwardly as I watched Chris thrash and scream in his mother's arms all the way out to the car. A near miss, that one.
