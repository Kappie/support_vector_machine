Some people would say they're sick.  But they're not sick. They're just different, and there's nothing wrong with that at all. Hell, we're all different.  The people I have run into were all so friendly and outgoing. They just started talking to complete strangers like myself. I think this admirable, really. I smiled and talked with them. I didn't treat them with any less respect than I would show anyone else. I don't know why anyone would.  Some people do, though. And it actually hurts me to see it.
