After just laying there for a couple of hours trying to fall asleep I would just end up  rolling  off my bed onto the floor [the rolling part was kinda fun!!] and then I would fall right asleep. See, our house was awesome. We had heated   floors !!! So  when  you would lay on the carpet it would be toasty and warm!! It rocked. In this house whenever  I  walk on the floors early in the morning I am like "Brrrr!!!" because I can totally  tell  a huge difference.  So, most nights I would sleep on our carpet. One night for some odd reason I slept totally weird. I woke up and I could not move. Like, at all. The only body part I could move was like my fingers. It was a sunday so we had to go to church and  my friends  and  I  would always run around and be crazy but I couldn't becuase it hurt so bad.   That  really stunk.    Today  I took a  super long shower. It was nice. But, the water was never the right temperature!!! I totally need to invent a  shower  that right when you turn it on it knows who you are and exactly what temperature you like so it heats up to that temperature. Wouldn't that rock?  I  think so.  Then I blow dryed my hair. My hair is growing so much!!! i  bet my the end of this school year it's going to be the same length it was before I  cut  it! Woohhoo!! Shot hair is nice and all, but I love long hair.  Did I tell you what i'm going to do next summer? At the very beginning I am going to get it don't in a TON of little braids! Woohoo! Then I will  never have to style it or anything!  I am quite excited.  but that's a long ways away.  Oh well.   I hope this  school  year is fun. I am starting to get scared, very scared. What if  everyone hates  me???  I don't see why they would or anything...but there are always those what if's.  I hope I find a lot of friends. Because Katie and Heather will be like the best of friends...so then there is me. I will eat   lunch  with them and everything but they have like so much sutff that's well..inside  I  guess. Like the two of them know everything about eachother. I bet Katie G. and I will  grow  really close becuase we are both good friends with Katie and Heather but we don't know all the  inside  information.  I wonder if we will have any classes together. because Katie G., Heather, and Katie are all in Algebra 2 and I am in Geomtry. Yuck. I think Katie and I might have history together though so that should be fun. History rocks.  I wanna be  a  history  teacher!  That would be fun.   I  want to teach Junior High because I want to be able to help those kids while they are in weird times.  it's  funny  how I am refering to Junior Highers as kids considering I was one yet a year and a half ago.  It seems like such a long time ago!!!   I  didn't really   like  junior high. It was my first year of real school so it was kind of scary. I got messsed up friends. At first they all said they were Christians but they totally didn't act like  Christians.  It was sad. I wonder where they are now. We kinda parted ways and lost touch, I hope they are ok.   [Did you see the secret message? Hahahhahahahha!!]
