I was just reading some stuff about movies on here and I was reading an article by some guy for the upcoming third episode of the Star Wars movie and the last bit made me laugh so I had to post it on here. The writer of this article (and I agree with him) thought that the first two episodes were very dull and so if you liked the first two episodes, well I'm sorry. Anyway, here's what I thought was funny:  "Maybe the best thing to do would be to get Anakin to embrace the Dark Side as quickly as possible, perhaps by forcing him to confront some terrible disappointment that will haunt him for the rest of his days. We suggest this two-line scene set in a Coruscant restaurant:  WAITER: Here’s your green salad, sir. ANAKIN:  What?  You fool, I told you NO CROUTONS! Aaaaaaargh!   Anakin puts on his black helmet and storms off to his local county clerk’s office and fills out the paperwork to have his name legally changed to “Darth Annie Vader.” (He later quietly drops the middle name, realizing it doesn’t help his macho image.) And then for the next two hours, it’s all special-effects spaceship battles, which is the real reason most of us will go to the theater anyway. Fade to black.   Christopher Bahn is a freelance writer in Minneapolis "  Yeah, I think that's pretty funny!! If you want to read the whole article here's the link: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4980465 I don't know how long it will be there, but it's there today for sure!! =)
