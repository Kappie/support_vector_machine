Things to do:      clean room  do summer reading and journals  finish scrapbook--france  start scrapbook--england  get saddle oxfords  get a kilt for school  start working out on monday so you can pass fitness testing    that's all i can think of. i'll come back with more later. ok, now i've got to go.
