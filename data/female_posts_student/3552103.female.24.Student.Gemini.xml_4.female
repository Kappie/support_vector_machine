The whole idea here is just to let myself free, say what's on my mind, no concerns... You see, life is so full of crap. We have so much in our mind that we end up losing ourselves in all kinds of things like work, money, school, and this things became our whole life. There's so much more out there... I mean we forgot about what really makes us human. We are all to busy to enjoy the simples things like the rainbow, or the flower, of the smell of rain... The ocean breeze when we are in our cars driving, our favorite song playing on the radio, our friends smiling when we arrive, dancing....   Just live, and enjoy life. I not saying to forget about work and all, but make sometime for pleasure too, it won't hurt, and I'm sure everything will work out just fine!
