It's nice to actually know someone in the camp ahead of time. Usually I would just hang around a bunch of people who didn't know me at all and probably liked me even less. But I've changed since then, and if wraith wasn't here right now I probably wouldn't even try to make friends. But she is here, thank the gods, so I don't have to. She's been a better friend to me than anyone ever had before. I'm really going to miss her...  I'm dying. I can feel myself slowly fade away. By changing schools again, all my parents are doing is alienating me (they seem to enjoy doing that to me...) and tearing away what I've become. For once, I actually know who I am, and they're taking it away. I don't think I'll survive losing myself this time...
