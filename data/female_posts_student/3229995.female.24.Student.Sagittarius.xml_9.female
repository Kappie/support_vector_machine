When watching Lena Endre in ‘Faithless’ one cannot stop and wonder how Björk won the Golden Palm for best acting at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000, because Endre is an acting tour-de-force. Liv Ullmann, herself one of the best actresses ever seen on the silver screen, has always been an actors director and this is evident in ‘Faithless’.  Who is in the wrong or right when a marriage is turning sour? Who is the victim in a divorce? These are the key points Ullmann highlights in her masterpiece penned by long time friend and former lover Ingmar Bergman.
