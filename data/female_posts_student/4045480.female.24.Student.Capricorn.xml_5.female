I guess you could sorta say my new embarcation into my new career has really prompted this, either that or I've finally got enough peer pressure. You know the old saying, if everyone jumps off a cliff... Anywho, this blog will in theory be an outlet for me to keep you all updated on life changes, thoughts, aspirations, and generally any crazy or imaginative thought that comes into my head on what I hope to be a regular basis. I guess this is as good a time as any to let you all know that I welcome most comments, questions, complaints, etc, but remember to be gentle;)
