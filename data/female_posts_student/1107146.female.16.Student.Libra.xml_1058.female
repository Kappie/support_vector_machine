Back when I first met Leigh Anne a lot of her friends started talking to me, and since they saw my picture they thought I  must  be at  least  sixteen, at LEAST. So they started hitting of me and trying  very hard  to be mature, to the point of causing not undue blushing on my part, but most of the time it was HILARIOUS to see these (what, children?) people talking so grown up as they did and not knowing that I would think a damned thing other than:  "Hey, I must be just a growed up as them."
