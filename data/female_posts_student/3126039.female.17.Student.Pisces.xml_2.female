Don't tell me that your not going to do something or you are going to do it, if you are just going to do the opposite of what you said. You know what I mean. This has happened to me twice in less then a week and the sad thing is it was from the same person. People don't have to lie to me, I rather have them tell me the truth then me get mad at them later when I find out they did otherwise or is going to do otherwise. Even if they think that it will hurt me I rather hear it from that person then from someone else. I really like the idea of posting my thoughts, its easier for me to get out what I have to say then always holding it inside because I am afraid of hurting someone or I am afraid that that person might get mad at me for saying what I have to say. This way I can say what I need and if that person lies to me or something I can tell them how I feel but not actually tell them because they might  not know this is about them.  Well my day today was really boring. I got up and I went to work. Then I got home and I did nothing. I really miss my Kenny I really haven't spent anytime with him the past 2 days. Yesterday he had to load the truck for drumline so I didn't get to hang out with him at lunch and then when I got back from lunch he was leaving and then today he is at Champs. Tomorrow I have to do family stuff because it is Easter, Monday I hope that he can go to Disneyland with us if not I will be sad because that means that I don't get to spend anytime with him during spring break because he is leaving on Wed., most likely, to go to the river with Matt, and other people I rather not mention. Tues. he has work and doesn't get off until 5 and we are suppose to go to Kokohos but that might not happen. Oh well I guess that it is his decision if we spent anytime together over spring break.
