[this was all last yr] basically he has left me alone since november last yr.. but before then he put me through all this crap like he used to swear at me and call me names.. even though he suposedly loved me.. i got really depressed and stuff over it because he was verbally harrasing me, still every time he said he loved me i felt soooooo bad [despite the nasty things he said to me] i felt awful!... and this year just today he decides to 'confess' his love for me again! his two friends that he has.. i know one of them (ben franklin - i love him to bits hes such a sweetie.. [hes in production aswell]) and the other chick i didn't know.. anyway they came up to me.. and ben franklin (the nice one) said: jen... and the girl butted in: ben (the stalker one - he knows where i live and he knows so much about me =( its sooooooooooo scary!) anyway.. ben likes you again! and i'm like: no i refuse to believe it and this went on for a while until i was like nearly crying.. and ben franklin (the nice one) pulled me into a hug and was like: jen it's alright, i know you don't want to hurt him again and its not your fault. hes such a sweetie.. and he was like rubbing my back when that stupid girl was like: C'MON! BEN (the stalker evil one) WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.. and i was like: i can't do this all over again! its too much! and yeh.. and then i just sort of left.. then after school at rehersals i saw ben franklin (the nice one) and he hugged me and apologized for ben (the stalker one) i just want it all to stop! and to top that day off.. in graphics kyle was teasing me sooooooooo much about dimitri.. it made me sooooooo upset! all in all i had a baddddddddddd day! anyway i better go.. ---------------> yeh oh and rj since you are the only one who is going to read this (the only person i know anyway) feel free to show juzzy (but no 1 else).. i dunno i trust you guys heaps.. and yeah thats the full story of ben which no one except you guys will kno... luv u both stax =) cya luv stax jen!
