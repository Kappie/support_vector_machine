I don't enjoy the self-doubt, and since there is absolutely nothing I can do about it, why worry? I've had some quality study sessions with both Liz and Jessica, and it's been nice having friends in all of my classes... I need to hang out with Liz and Melissa more. I've been bad about that; but after this week, things should be less hectic. Although, I think I need to get in some serious pool time, though I may just go to the rec pool or something. Makes me nervous to go alone, but it'll probably be good for me. Maybe I'll go tomorrow after class.... anyone want to go to the pool with me tomorrow? Eh, I probably should just go alone so I can lay out and study.
