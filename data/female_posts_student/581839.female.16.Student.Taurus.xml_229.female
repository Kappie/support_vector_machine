I went to Dsineyland, which was really cool, bigger than EuroDisney, which is in europe.  my fave subject at school is drama, obviously, but apart from that, i don't mind maths.  my teacher is pretty good and i have lots of friends in that class.  ok, must dash,  tom  i mean, how cute is that? the whole penpal thing was in a different letter to antoinette, that's why it's not on here. anyway, i'm totally exctied. whatever. anyway, i have a lot a lot a lot of homework to do, but i'll try updating soon.
