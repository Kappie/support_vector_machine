I'm keeping up a daily correspondence with cottage dude. He's 30 years my senior; we're spending the 8th together. He is going to read to me. What exactly, I'm not sure.  M. leaves Toronto on the 7th. She promises she'll be back some day.  Found this fun site:  urlLink http://illustmaker.abi-station.com/index_en.shtml  where you can make your animated portrait. Sincemost Japanese don't have curly hair, I'm having a really hard time finding a hairstyle that fits. None of these look like me at all. Everytime I try to make one they turn out looking so pretty.    urlLink     urlLink     More to come...
