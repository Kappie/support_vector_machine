Melissa would know where I'm referring to... we sat outside my Jazz class 2 summers ago (It's by all those chair/table things)... anyhow, I've had an interestingly easy day at classes.  Now, I'm just trying to kill some time on campus before I leave to get lunch before work.  Ya see, I always have to sit around waiting in traffic to get off campus, and so I'm avoiding that.  I'm also trying to give myself less of an opportunity to go to Target and buy something I don't even really need.  I compulsively buy things from time to time.  This is a VERY bad habit.  I used to not have this problem.  It was always one that Joe had.. not me.  Well, so I'm struggling with it now.  On another note which is related to spending money, I have bought my winter coat.  Ricky made fun of me last night because I was wearing it in the house.  But it was really cold, and I was just in the mood to wear it and break it in.  It sorta reminds me of the one that Melissa got from Burlington Coat Factory a year ago, except it's not that woolish type of fabric.  It's polyester.  Anyhow, it's really empty in here now.  Almost SCARILY empty.  I mean, I've NEVER seen it this empty in here before.  I almost have an okay feeling about if I got up and went to the restroom leaving things at the computer the way they are, and leaving my backpack over here as well.    So, what else...?  Oh!  I just saw Matt Case... he was with some girl.  Quite funny... ya know, he's in one of my classes, and he's always really nice to me.  I think it's because he doesn't want to get on my bad side.  After all, I have the dirt on him and his Kenny Baker days.  He's been dressing like a DMB fan these days.  Ya know... grungy, well-worn-in jeans... Abercrombie-ish shirt colors... flip flops, even!  Drastic change from when he was wearing FUBU and talking ebonics don't ya think???  He doesn't want me to blow his cover.  See, I have nothing to hide.  I'm pretty much the same as I was in my junior/senior years of high school... and even my goth days I am not ashamed of... and really, I don't think anyone in the arts building would care about that, because half of them are STILL in their goth phases.  :-)  Okay, I'm rambling now... but I just haven't gotten the chance to ramble on my blog in such a long time...  Maybe I should make this a MWF habit!  :-)  Anyway, I think I'm going to wrap this up and get on out of here...  It's time to go to Subway and see my friends.  :-)  Yes, that's right.  The people who work at the Subway on Bandera Rd. know me.  I walk in, their day is happier.  We joke around... this one lady (whose son works there with her) embarrasses him by telling me things from his childhood and how they never thought he'd have hair (or something) and now his hair is to his shoulders.  Funny characters they are.  Whoa... that was a very Smeagolish way for me to say that... "Come on hobbitses... follow me"  "But they stole the precious"  "No, master wouldn't steal her..." "Yes he would.. he's tricksy... he LIES..."  Anyhow.. enough of that for now... more later!  :-)
