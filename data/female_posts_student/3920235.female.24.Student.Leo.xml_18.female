A few of my nails have dents in them where she didn't file the tops down very well and the edges around my cuticles are really rough. Not to mention that it's only been a week and I am in serious need of a fill-in. Oh yeah, and when she did my nails it took an hour and a half for a damn fill-in. It should only take 30 minutes, 45 minutes tops. That's why I always request Tony to do my nails. But he's always so busy with other requests and appointments that it's almost impossible to get him to do my nails. So this is the second time she's done my nails and it's the last. I'm not going to go back there. I want to go to the woman that Ashlie went to when she was still in Evansville, but I can't remember her name or where she works. She files everything by hand instead of using a dremel, which I like, and she's not much more expensive than these places I've been going.   I sent Ashlie an email last week asking her the girl's name but I haven't heard back from her yet. I don't imagine that I will until they get settled in their new place. So for now I'm going to go to the place Karen went to last week. I need to take the ones I have off, but I don't want to have to sit with my hands soaking in acetone for God knows how long. Sure I'd cut the tips off for it to take less time but I'd still have to soak them. I keep trying to talk myself out of a new set until next month but I really want a french manicure again and if I have it done with the nails I have, it's going to look fucked up. So I guess I'll have to take these fuckers off sometime this week.  This weekend was actually pretty good. Volksfest was going on but we didn't make it down there this year. Todd was hungover all Friday because he went out on Thursday to his pool league and didn't get home until 430am Friday morning. I wasn't too happy about that but I guess I felt okay about it because he ended up feeling like shit all day. He brought it on himself so I wasn't going to bitch about it. Serves him right. Anyway, so Friday night I talked to Karen for a while and then ended up staying home with Todd, which was nice. I didn't do any homework so I actually got to spend some time with him. Mom did the laundry for me on Friday so I had all of Saturday to do what I wanted, which was great. I fucked around on the computer for a while making my SIME CD that I need to send out, then I picked up Todd's check and bought him some lunch from Chick-Fil-A. I went to the mall and got my hair trimmed and bought a clear tongue stud for when I start student teaching. I stopped by the Italian charm place but didn't get anything because I didn't want to stand there and look at them all and they're kind of expensive anyway. I'd already spent enough money. So I was leaving and I made a pit stop at the candy store. Bought about a pound of Jelly Bellies, mmm. God I am going to make myself so sick. It's amazing that with all the junk food I've been eating for the past month that I've lost 6 pounds. I feel like shit though because of all the junk food. Blah. Anyway, I had to go to the Teachers' Aid for class and that wasn't too bad. I'm a sucker for school supplies so I liked having to go down there. It was really cool because instead of having to remember everything I looked at or taking in a pen and pad of paper, I just typed up my whole report on my Palm, then downloaded it to my computer. I love my Palm. Then it was off to WalMart, where I spent an hour shopping and another hour waiting to check out. It always amazes me that WalMart has ~30 check out lanes but they only have like 5 of them open at a time. It also pisses me off that their commercials brag about how fast it is to get in and get out while getting everything you need, but that's total bullshit. Anyway, then I went home and put the food away and did the dishes and vacuumed and put the clothes away and made the bed... I was so productive!  I thought Todd and I were going to go to Volksfest but he called me from work and said that he was going to go down to Jimtown Bar to play in a pool tournament. That was fine with me because I wanted to go to Karen's to hang out, which I did. That was cool because I got to see her and Bobby and the kids, I had a good meal, and Bobby made it worth my while with a little gift (and gave me some to take home). I got home at 11pm and Todd walked in the door like 5 minutes later. He wasn't too happy about the fact that I'd smoked with Bobby and he was skeptical that Bobby would just give me some with no strings attached, but after a few minutes he let it go, which I was happy about. The last thing I wanted was to fight about it. I understand why he's uncomfortable about it, but there are things that I am uncomfortable with that he does that I just let go. And it's not like I do it all the time. Anyway...  Sunday we slept in but the day wasn't wasted. We got the trash taken out and cleaned the porch off really well, plus the sidewalk next to the porch. We dusted and washed off the furniture, and dusted and lubed the bike which I took out for a short spin. I should do that more often. We smoked a bowl, had awesome sex, then went to Dad's for dinner with him and Sharon, and Shelley and Paul. I brought home some stuff that Sharon had given me but Todd gave me some shit about it because he's always saying that I bring stuff home regardless of whether we need it or not. That's true, but I had plans for the stuff that was in the bag. But I didn't want to hear him complain about it and he was right anyway, so as soon as we got home, I pitched it. We talked about it some more when we got in the house and I brought up the fact that he brings shit that we don't need home too, though he might not do it as much as I do. We finally just let it go and then later he said that he felt bad for making me throw the stuff out. I told him to not feel bad because he didn't make me do anything and he was right.  Anyway, so now I just got done with class. Two weeks left, thank God.
