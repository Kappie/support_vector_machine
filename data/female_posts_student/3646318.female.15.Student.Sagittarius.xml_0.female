Steven's father has been dead since before he ever got to know him, a car crash or something, I'm not really sure because he never talks about it. He usually comes over Sunday but I dont think he is...he just wants to sit in his room for that day. I dont blame him and I know what some of his pain feels like. I sometimes think mine is worse because I knew my daddy and I was SO close to him and then he abandons me last year at 14. It's hard to cope. Yet, I couldnt imagine what Steven must feel like...and I bet he would kill to have had even a minute of what I had. I'm not going to calm him by telling him I know what it feels like because number one, I dont because my father is still alive, and number two, I always hated it when people said it to me. Father's day is coming...I wish it didnt exist...but I also wish Steven was here. I cant expect him to help ME with my issues with my father because at least I can tell him, and I could touch my father if I wanted to...but he cant, his is dead...so I wish he wouldnt spend it alone...but I dont know.
