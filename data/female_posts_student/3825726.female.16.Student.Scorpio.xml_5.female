But then this morning my mom decides to tell me that my dog wuz bleeding last night "oh, it didn't look too bad, not much blood." She's a fucking black dog, of course it's not gonna look like much when u can't see it? Couldn't she have checked more to see if it wuz  a deep wound?! Fuckin' A. Then she's like "and I wuz petting her and she felt very frail, her back bone was slim and she felt very thin." Uh yah, duh, she's old, and she needs to be fed more often. My dad knew that she had been wandering lately cuz unfortunately she's very old and can't remember anything so she just kind of goes whenever and can never find her way back, did he keep her inside? No, of course not, he'd rather let her wander off and die slowly on her own. If I would have known she was "sick" last night I would have taken care of her!!!! I am very mad and upset, I just want to see her before she's gone forever! She's my favorite, I got her for my birthday! So now I'm at work balling my eyes out for going on an hour now... I haven't done anything becuz I'm so angry at my parents. We're leaving for a week and I'll die if I don't find her before we leave. She means so much to me!!! If anybody (not like anyone rly live sby me) hears about her/finds her call me please! *Missing her Baby*
