Instead I took a bag and placed a spare change of clothes, two boxes of water balloons, my make-up bag, and two cans of red bull into it. I took and shower and put on some scrubby clothes, grabbed my purse and scrambled out the door after putting my bag of supplies into two tubs.  I drove to Michelle's house to wake her up, I passed by the pre-dismissal high school with 5 police cars parked outside, every spare teacher / administrative being were standing, guarding. I got to Michelle's house and woke up her up, she got dressed, we filled water balloons, and then headed out to begin the war.   We drove by the high school again, everyone had been let out I'd assume at 10:18 or something. So we cruised Wallace neighborhood and eventually spotted a white mini-van (belonging to Billy Firn) with SENIORS 'O4!!! plastered on the back. So we stalked him, he tried to get us to pull around to "talk" to us, but we knew better. They met up with a silver station wagon belonging to Alonzo and Alan and all those shits. We said "fuck it" to Billy's hoard of people, and started stalking the wagon. Then drove all the way back to my neighborhood then stopped at the stop sign on the corner of Edison and Burns after we threw a couple balloons at their car. Here come the jackasses with eggs and silly string, I fortunately peeled out fast enough to dodge the egg, they weren't quick enough prepping the string. We took them on a cat and mouse chase all through the suburb, getting trapped once behind Billy's car, and some white Grand-Am that tried to race me earlier. They busted out with more eggs, and we called it quits with the water balloons. I was so pissed off. Michelle and I went to Walgreens and picked up a carton of eggs and some shaving cream (which we never actually used), and came back to fuck with the seniors. It was payback time. We hit them three times, all across the senior bullshit on the back of the mini-van. Alonzo got hit with a ricochet water balloon that hit the side of his car first, but splashed all over him. We had gone by Jeanette, Patrick, Brian, and all those fuckers and gotten egged so we drove by their place and threw a nice little sticky egg to the back of their freshly cleaned car. We camped outside Ned's house after getting a car wash ourselves, and cleaned the remnants of egg off my car. We waited for him to arrive so we could chuck the last three balloons at either him or his car. He was a no show. Oh well.  Michelle and I headed to Pinball Pete's for some after-war celebrations, but we were both whipped. Got our usual Starbucks, and played some pool, DDR, driving games, blah blah blah. We were thinking about heading to the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, but it's Sat, Sun, Mon; not Fri, Sat, Sun. Oh well... we're going Sunday instead.   I'll post my little emotional break down sometime later... I'd end up throwing something breakable at my wall (probably the laptop) if I do it now. I'm too pissed off.
