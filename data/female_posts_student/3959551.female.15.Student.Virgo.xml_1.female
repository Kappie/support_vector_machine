Ive been hanging out with my boyfriend Billy the entire summer and its been great. But, he starts college in like 2 weeks and then i wont get to see him hardly at all. Between his job and his classes its gonna be all i can do to talk to him every once in a while. Sucks yes? Yep, sure does.Yeah my parents decided that they needed to be closer to their job so we're moving like 45 minutes away and that'll help my scheduling problems. It'll do wonders.   Verdammt!   I'm sure I'll be okay but we've been together for almost 8 months now and this is gonna brake us up i bet. I hate to say it but its inevitable. Of course my darling mother is trying to force me to get a job...not gonna happen. My parents are insane. I hate it when they think they can make you do what they want so they just annoy the crap out of you until you do it just to make them leave you alone. Heh. They think they are smart but little do they know. Oh well. I should be asleep but I think im an insomniac. Hmm...what exaclty is the occult? The only thing i know about it is that Tool has one of their songs named Faaip De Oiad, which means "Wordof God" in Enochian which is an occult language. I guess it was just like a group of people or a belief or something.I dunno sounds creepy though. Yeah so The 4400 show that comes on Sunday is really good! Plus that guy they have playing one of the abductees is really friggin hot so that makes it better than anything else on a sunday night that i know of. Meh. Bedtime.
