I have developed a new love for processed cheese singles over the last little while. yes, the girl who not long ago refused to eat leftovers now eats like a 19 year old bachelor. i had forgotten about cheese singles for so long.  i love their tang that is unlike any known flavour in the natural world.  but most of all, i love their smooth texture and their give.     a slow bite into processed cheese folded in 3s. mmmm....
