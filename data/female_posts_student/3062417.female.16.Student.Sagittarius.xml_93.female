And I got out of school early to go to Kim's softball game in Hannibal. They lost 6-8. It was a good game though. They should have won but that's ok. Then we went to an all you can eat buffet and there were a bunch of Menninites (Amish people) there and they smelled bad. Right Carol? Well, atleast the food was good. I ended up getting home around 9:30.   Friday- I went to Spanish and did nothing. Then we left to go to Fulton for majors fest. I wish I went to that school. There are so many good looking guys there. We had some fun flirting with the cute guys. Dave had a big fat guy blow him a kiss. That was nasty. I always have fun at those kinda things. I got home around 6:30 and then drove back to school at 7:30 to pick up Emily. Then I just sat at home and did nothing for the rest of the night. Fun right?  Today- I rode my bike down to Ward's with Carol and Kim. Then I went back to their house and hung out for a while. Then I came back here and watched some tv until I got bored of that. Now I'm just online listening to Rise Against. Later I don't think I'm doing anything or tomorrow either so if anyone wants to do anything just let me know.  Listening to: [Voices Off Camera by Rise Against]  can you hear the desperate cries that are calling out your name? twisting your arms, holding out their hands and tugging at your sleeve, do you feel this underlying sense of urgency or are you as blind as me?  I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere now   I can't bear the thought of losing,   I dread the attention winning brings   and ever since the day I came I can stand without your strings    I'm so sick of all these people   but I'm scared to be alone    and if this life has taught me anything I forgot it long ago  and so I  I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes    the heart is something you can't control we either choose to follow or be left on our own so we're leaving here on a less-travelled road as desperate cries grow louder, I know we're getting close, getting close    I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes
