Just so happened that I had a packet of Maxwell Instacoffee hiding in my dresser drawer... so, one cup of java later, I'm feeling some semblance of my humanity.  Last week, I finally became tired of using this G3 Laptop(alas, Wallstreet you served me well), and started searching for a decent PC Desktop to use. It's kinda blasphemy in this house, to use a PC... since we're all Mac-heads. But... it kinda blows to not be able to do alot of things online just because I'm using a Mac.  So, I was looking for computer online... ran across this neat site called Craigslist.org. That place kicks serious ass, people. It's basically one big classified listing. Everything from jobs to personals to Free crap are listed. Anyway, their DC listing was crawling with great deals on comps(as well as other stuff). In fact, that was where I ultimately found my PC.  I went to check it out last Sunday... not bad, a HP Pavilion 8690c, I think. Keep in mind, I'm a techie, so I did actually sit down and take a good look at its innards. There was some superficial rusting on the outside(God only knows how that happened), but otherwise in peak condition. Not bad for a 2000 model. Furthermore, not bad for 264 bucks. So what's the catch? It doesn't come with a monitor. Or a mouse...which kind of sucks.  Now, I keep around random PC parts in my room... so after coffee, I started digging. Found two computer mice... now all I need is a monitor.  Maybe craigslist has one for free...or cheap...
