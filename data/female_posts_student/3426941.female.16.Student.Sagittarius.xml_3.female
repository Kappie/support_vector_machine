I don't think that it is fair for there to be a technology meeting after school for and entire friggin' hour when I have a friggin' bio test to cram for TOMORROW!!!  oK. Done with my venting. I was just so frusterated at the tech people that I decided to not go.I'll probably get a detention. Oh well. Haven't had one all year.   Anywho, caint talk much now 'cause of the impending test... Now I get to learn all about organisms.  Nevermind that the pages of my frog lab got stuck together with frog juice therefore preventing me from getting an A on the darn thing... Sorry. C-ya.
