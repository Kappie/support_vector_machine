What can we start with today? I think that I will do the easiest first. That would be the Bertram’s Hotel.  The Bertram’s Hotel  	Today the book didn’t really get very interesting. All that happened was that some guy who was supposed to be a race car driven barged into the hotel looking for Lady Sedgwick. The mans name was Ladislaus Malinowski. And Elvira was asking if she had any money. The answer was yes. So she began asking where it is. What will happen to it if I die? While my husband get it if I die? Is it is a trust Fund? Who is putting money into the trust fund? When will I get the money? And other basic things like that. The guy that she was asking Colonel Luscombe was trying to figure out why Elvira was asking these things now. Why she wanted to know these things? And what brought this all on.
