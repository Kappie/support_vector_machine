And as he and the rest of my friends from that... company... would tell you, it really doesn't matter in what manner you die as long as there's... a certain piece of technology... nearby.  Sorry, it's just seemed that way, what with the baka and rum and "snake head" discussions and all.  Yeah, I'll try to convince her of that! Wait, you're from, what, the 1800's? And you know about different kinds of peanut butter?  Ah, yes, dark chocolate. The best food-like substance in the world! Too bad it's so expensive. Now, I won't take you up on any offer of rum, but if you're going to be handing out some of that "fine Caribbean dark chocolate", I'll be more than happy to lighten your load of that!  Nah, I'd rather that they were fully conscious and understand exactly how we're gonna cure them. (Though I have to admit, drunk or not, it's hilarious to see their faces when we tell them!)
