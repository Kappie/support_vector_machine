He's not too happy now either, but he will be soon.It was a long trip, but totally fun. 12 different hotels, and a lot of hot guys at every one!!And the best news of all. Next year for sure we are moving to Carson City Nevada. I can't wait!! Only 12 months. And when we get there maybe a drivers permit, and I'm finally getting a Golden Retriever puppy.I wish it were sooner but oh well. And the best part only one more year at DPHS. I get to go to a huge HS with lots of guys!!Yep Yep!! Anyway please visit my site and take the polls.   Pro-life rocks. God Bless.                                  **Stef**
