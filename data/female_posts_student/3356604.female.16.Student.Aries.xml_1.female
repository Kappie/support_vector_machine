It was my grandmother's birthday, so she came and watched the play along with my aunt, uncle and cousin and some other family friends that I met up with afterwards. I think they all enjoyed the play, which is about 50% of the point of putting on a play. Then there were the presentations, which involved several 'Hello, Dolly!' songs having their words changed so they were about both the Musical Director, Tina, and the Director, Annette. Then Annette had written a poem thanking everyone she could possibly have thanked, and lots of people were given out cards and things. After all that, we had a sing along and ate Marcel's cake (which was amazing...he'd made this huge cherry/chocolate cake and then with a toothpick drawn in chocolate the likenesses of the leads and the BATS logo on white chocolate. He said it took him 12 hours...I said to Adam, that was 11 hours more than I would be willing to spend on a cake) and then my dad said that he wanted to take my brother and sister home. I didn't really want to leave, but Adam, bless him, said he'd drive me home. Dad seemed about as cool with that as he'd ever be, so I was able to stay until almost two, dancing, singing and having an awesome time. As soon as I got home, I washed my hair (I never, ever will have to sleep with it like that again!) and fell into bed. I got up at about 3-ish this afternoon.
