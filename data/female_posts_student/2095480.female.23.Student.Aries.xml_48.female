Basically, I pulled in front of a driver at the intersection of Norman and St. Augustine, cutting his path short... It was storming and I simply didn't see him. Its not like I did it on purpose. Anyway, even after we had both stopped for the red light, about 5-10 feet later he just continued to honk at me. After a few frustrating moments I decided to just get out of there and I turned into Mc'D's and he even kept honking at me after that!!! Geesh. The car looked just like Patrick's but I know its not him. Anyway, angry drivers suck.
