I mean, it's partially my fault. I mean... I don't know. I don't know what I mean anymore. I'm so tired. I'm so confused. It's like there's so much I want to do there's never anything I can actually do. No one ever tells me anything. I have a song stuck in my head, and I don't know what it is!!! I'm losing my fecking mind!    god, I don't know. the better I feel, the harder I fall, ya know? but seriously, do I have to fall so soon after I feel so good? it makes me just feel worse, you know? like it wasn't real to begin with. why do i feel so cheap?   tell me, did i make a mistake tonight?
