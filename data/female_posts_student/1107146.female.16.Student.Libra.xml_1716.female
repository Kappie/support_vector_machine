I still think I'm right, but yall weren't the ones who should have taken the brunt of my semi-tamper tantrum.    And a note to everyone:  I'm going to be really on edge these next two weeks.  Not only is Megan coming, but I'm starting on Prednisone, which makes me really angry really easily, and I explode at little things.  In fact, yall may just want to steer clear of me unless you think you can handle me being really mean.  And I'm going off medicine that I've been on for two years starting tomorrow so that's not really helping things either.  Just an FYI so yall can prepare yourselves.
