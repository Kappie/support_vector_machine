If u believe that u are beautiful, then you are. you are going to be the most gorgeous person in the world if u think that you are. The way you feel about urself is the way life will feel for you.   "I can't stay in one place, The memories they chase me, Around the room, I planted a shade tree, And I lay there thinkin' about you, Yeah, The leaves fall around me, I'd love to blow away with them, If I could" --Hot Action Cop - In a little while  If i could do alot of things i would but i cant so i won't  i dotn mean to down, or be a downer and be pessimistic about everything but sometimes when u truly open up ur eyes its really hard not to be. im out
