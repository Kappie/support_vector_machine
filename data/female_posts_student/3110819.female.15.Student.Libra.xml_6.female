I'm not competing, cause I can't, but I'm going to take pics and vid.  I have to take my uniform, but I don't think it'll be very easy to take pics in it (a little bulky) so I hope I don't hafta wear it all day.  Our school Prom's this weekend on Sat.  Some of my friends are going, you should see them.  Freshmeat going to prom!  Yaaaay! [insert sarcasm here]  Whatever, I guess it's their deal.  I got a letter from L yesterday, so I'm not worried about her any more.   Okay, I deserve a vent.  Since I'm gonna be gone tomorrow, I'm missing my science test.  So my teacher's all like, (yesterday) "you HAVE to make it up thursday" so I crammed pretty much all last night.  ugggh.  To make it worse, I get there before school like he said, and he's like "well, I'm changing the test so you can't take it now cause it's not done. (this is at like, 7:30) you can take it 7th period during your class." so I'm thinking, okay, guess I can do that.  I get there 7th and he's like, "well, you have to take it monday. It's not done".  So, after making me crash-study, he's not ready.  [screams in frustration]  He totally lost all the respect I had for him at that moment.  (which was almost none anyway cause he acts like this all the time)  If he's gonna tell me I hafta take it and I study harder than I ever have for his test, he should have been ready. [end of vent]  Oooooohhhhhhh!!!!!!!! Psycho obsession time!!!  (To be warned, I am now going to talk about Tuesday's   One Tree Hill urlLink   So if you haven't seen it, I recommend for you to stop reading now.... ......can't say I didn't warn you.  Oh my gosh!!!! I CANNOT BELIEVE BROOK IS PREGNANT.  I personally think that it's not Lucas's kid, I think it's that guy's in the bar, but, you never know.  And Keith proposed!! Yay! I don't think she'll say yes though.  I don't know why, just an instinct.  Oh, and the whole thing w/ Jake and Nikki was kinda harsh.  I know she walked out on him and Jenny, but, ouch.  I can see where he's coming from though.  On a final note, I don't care how much you think you love your bf, you DO NOT let him make you think you need a tattoo.  Directly or indirectly.  I definetly can't wait till next week.  talk back later.....;-)
