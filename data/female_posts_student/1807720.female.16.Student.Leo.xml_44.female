I am drowning my emotions in food and I gained 3 pounds and like oh God I have to stop like NOW...or I will blink at gain 10 pounds and that CAN'T happen cause in high school every looks at people and judges them non - stop and yeah that includes the way others look and well I like the compliments of how good I look now.  You know it's weird though cause I thought loosing weight would solve everything and make me happier but ya know what is didn't change a thing, not one.  In fact I don't think that was ever the problems it's just I have many problems right now that some way or another I have gotta deal with em' but it's hard.  And my TA didn't help that matter today, lots of the things she says makes me feel bad and makes me feel like I will never amount to anything.  And well she was like "Well do you guys know how hard it is to get into university and she was like and did you know what the average acceptance average for a grade 12 overall is 82% and yeah that sure is high so you odds of getting into University are slim and you sure better get going now to get those marks you guys need"  Like AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I did NOT need to hear that cause frig it's not fair to people like me or TRY AND TRY AND TRY and just never can get over a certain mark no matter what and like I don't think acceptance into University should be based on only marks I mean cause then they aren't getting the really serious, dedicated, and focused people that know what they want in life that work so hard for it kind of people.  And really it is not fair to only choose the really smart people.  And well yeah she is kinda right though cause I am gonna have to work my ass off to get the marks and I HAVE to get into University.  I could just picture the outcome now if I didn't get in.  Lets just say suicide rates are really gonna go up and stuff and well I couldn't imagine not getting into University, that would like ruin my life forever and it would be like someone crushing my heart with a giant rock.  I could not let that happen.  Well I guess I still have to get through grade 11 and well 12 too but well grrrr why can't I just be finished with this all - I want a husband and kids and stuff and a REAL job...I don't want to go to school anymore.  I want kids more than anything right now - just kids that I love and will love me in return and a husband and stuff to love me too.  I guess one day that will probably come and later I will wish to be back in high school but I would soooooo any day rather have the stresses of adult life than teen life.  Like seriously ANY DAY I know I would choose that over what I feel now.  It will be sad when grad eventually comes and I say good-bye to some people but then I would be just one more step towards my future.  I can't wait right now actually but I have GOTTA STOP EATING!!!  I can like feel my stomach gettin bigger and stuff and well I just wanna be thin like all the other girls - it's not fair.  Of course it seems like nothing in my life is fair right now.  O well, I guess that is just the way things are.
