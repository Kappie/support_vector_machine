Why aren't we playing something that we as a freshman band CAN PLAY?? Aren't we supposed to showing off OUR talents?!?!? UUGGHH!!! IT MAKES ME SO MAD. And to top it off we as the freshman band can hardly even play the parts we're given! This is a really stupid decision on the directors part... grrrrr... I want to get all my homework done before the concert, so that's what I'm gonna do now.  Peace Kristin
