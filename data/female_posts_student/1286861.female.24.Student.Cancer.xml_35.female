Ruben (with whom I work) makes wonderful mexican food, and he brought some sweet tamales and taquitos for breakfast. 2. My baby Brenden is picking me up from work. I can't wait to see him. 3. I hope that Brenden and I will be able to go to see Chris later tonight and pick up the computer he has so graciously found for me.  Again, it may only be 7:30, and I still might be asleep ar delirious, but the world seems to be ok. It's not normal for me to feel this way in the morning. But let's just go with it.
