Several important news items today, all of which deserve equal attention, therefore, for the business school student in all of us, a bulleted list:    Blogging has been hard to come by lately, due to a bizarre computer dysfunction that has rendered my z, x, c, b, n, and m keys useless. I'm not sure why the v was spared. I would think that if you had to give up a row of keys, it would be the bottom one, but there are very few coherent sentences that don't contain at least one of those letters. So home computer usage is a no-go for now, and work has been very crazy, to say the least.       Moving is one of the few things I'm not very good at. This problem is compounded by the fact that when I'm not good at something, I tend to just not do it at all (see: Playstation 2 games, volleyball). Some of these activities, however, are required (e.g., parking) and moving falls into that category. I have now put off packing until I have exactly 3 evenings left before the big U-Haul arrives. I really don't feel like packing tonight, either, but my mom keeps calling and reminding me of the time she showed up on moving day and I hadn't packed a thing. She was livid. I was also asleep on the couch with a NASCAR race on when she arrived, so that kind of made it worse. She's threatening bodily harm if everything isn't neatly boxed up by Friday morning.       The South Texas Bachelorette Weekend of Fun. This was one of the highlights of my summer. It consisted of my best friend, who's getting married at Thanksgiving, her sister and yours truly hanging out in various parts of south Texas all weekend and drinking lots of beer. We floated the Comal river, with some parts being less "float" and more "hold on for dear life." Luckily, going somewhere with Darby is like having your own personal Eagle Scout; not only had she packed the basics, like a cooler o' cans, some munchies, sunscreen, etc., but she also vacuum sealed towels and dry clothes for after the ride. Unfortunately, they all flew out when we hit our first big set of rapids. Also at this juncture, while Darby worked on cutting her tube away from the trees she hit, some preadolescent delinquents stole all of the cash out of our cooler. The little punks weren't even old enough to go for the beer and cigarettes. Bastards. They then had the nerve to tell Darby that "If there was any money in there, it must have floated away." If I hadn't been chasing my flip-flops through rushing water, I would have beaten their river rat asses. The river police, of course, were busy writing tickets for people who had styrofoam coolers instead of investigating robberies, so we gave up and continued to float. It was a great time, though, and I managed to get some good sun. I've been spending most of my time indoors and I was beginning to get a little pasty.        The South Texas Bachelorette Weekend of Fun, part II: After having dinner at the Gristmill in Gruene (excellent, especially when all you've had all day is beer and sun) with some lovely companions from St. Mary's that we lured to dinner with us, we crashed a bachelor party at Tavern on the Gruene, down the road. Actually, we were minding our own drunken business and our table was crashed by the bachelors (most of whom were married). But it was all in good fun. We finally drug Darby back to the hotel, where we nursed sunburns and hangovers most of the morning.       The South Texas Bachelorette Weekend of Fun, the finale: Met up with Mom in Luckenbach to hear some good tunes and relax for one more day. Was pleasantly surprised to see several of my favorites were playing, and even more pleasantly surprised to run into some friends from back home. A fitting conclusion to a great "last hurrah" of a weekend.       Finally, yesterday evening I made my way back to Fort Worth to get one last Pappadeaux's fix before heading to the land with no saltwater nearby. The ladies from Hillsboro introduced me to Gator Water, which is (from what I can tell) a Hurricane topped with a margarita topped with a shot of something green. They were delicious. Several of them, each better than the last. After some racy stories and more than one wobbly trip to the restroom, we ventured back towards Waco. Previous plans were to have a semi-slumber party at Cyndi's house, which is much closer to the office than my house. I wondered, en route, if we should stop and get some beer, and Cyndi rattled off what was already at the house. It was like the Cricket's draft list; we didn't need a pit stop at all. After some domestics, a few imports, and a couple of Goldschlager shots, it was--of course--time to play dominoes. Somehow I made it until 2, waiting for someone else to say they were tired so I wouldn't be the first one again. I think it was pretty even this time. I successfully navigated Cyndi's house this morning and made it to work on time, comforted by the fact that my coworkers were as miserable as I was all morning. It also helped that I had leftover salmon for lunch.        I'm so bad at bulleted lists. I'm too long-winded for them. But at least I try.   So that's it. These events, among others, are what has kept me from the blessed blog lately. I'll be cutting off the utilities this weekend and heading to Dudley, which is the greatest place on earth, but also does not have broadband internet. So if I can bear the rotary dial-up (I'm not joking, Mom still has a rotary phone and refuses to get touchtone), I'll be in touch next week.   Also, anyone interested in a *free* two-way trip to Kansas can have their dream come true this weekend. That's right, folks, just a little heavy lifting and you'll have the pleasure of riding in a vehicle with me for over 16 hours. Interested parties can sign up below or register by phone.
