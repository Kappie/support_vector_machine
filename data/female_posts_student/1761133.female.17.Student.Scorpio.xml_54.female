Too many social invitations could come your way today, and you may have to turn one of them down. You may not be in the mood for socializing, feeling the need to be alone to organize your thoughts, yet one of the events could be somehow business-related and you could feel obligated to be there. Put in an appearance. Don't feel compelled to stay very long.  OMG! This is exactly what happened to day..freaking out!
