I fell asleep this afternoon (when I got home) which explains why I'm STILL doing homework. Then again, I had to watch Smallville. Otherwise no one would find out that Chloe dies. Anjie is looking into BFD tickets. I haven't done math homework. I haven't studied the subjunctive. I don't know what the past subjunctive tense is used for.
