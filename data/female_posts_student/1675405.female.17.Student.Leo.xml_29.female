I forgot to bring home my history book to do AP this weekend. Again. God, I am so forgetful. I need to get a new brain... mine has gone to dust. I think I am going to go to "UN" (ha) and really get some sort of a start on it, at least so I can get some points. Better than zero out of 15!   Heather came over earlier to pick up her stuff that she left at my house yesterday, and to drop off some stuff she borrowed to wear for the dance. She brought some nasty, hairy, slouchy "I hate life" boy into my house and introduced me to him as "Tim," the guy I now realize she went out with last summer, and the very same guy that wants her now. Yay! I am so excited for her! She gets into a scratching eyeballs out arguement with her "beau" Michael, and now spends all day today with this guy. I know, I know, it isn't any of my business, but still, I can't stand to even think about the guys she gets involved with. I care about her way too much to see her around people she can do way better than.
