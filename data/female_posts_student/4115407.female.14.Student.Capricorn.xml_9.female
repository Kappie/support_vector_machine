I mean i hope i never have to deal with a physical abuse relation cause if i do im kickin his butt first then im leaving him lol, but im glad that i have a bf that wont well he said he wouldnt and i believe him, that wont hit me, i mean when i hear that girls have been killed by their boyfriends that pisses my off, cause they shoudnt hace stayed in the abusive relationship to the point where he killed u, im mean u may love him, but he doesnt love u if he is willin 2 kill u, y would u want a man that puts his hands on. There is also the relationships where only the boys want sum, but dont want u for ur personality, i mean a girl can be attractive but dont waste a girl's time 4 that, im glad he isnt like that either, i dont think he is, i hope he isnt. Im jus glad i found sum 1 that would treat me right, i mean this summer i think i saw him like twice, but that was because i was doin stuff, and he wasnt here, then i wasnt there, but i think i kno him enough to kno that he wouldnt do that. Even though he can get moody and ignore me but, im sure he doesnt do it on purpose and i dont mind if he does, i mean i do, but i dont it a big deal, i rather him ignore me than yell at me, or abuse me mentally or physically. I hope that it works out, but even if it does during high school will it during college, cause im goin 2 college and im goin 2 california, and i dont think his parents would want him follwong sum girl, but maybe we will move together, i hope, that would be cool, if we did. But im greatful, and i hope that all my friends and family could work out or meet the person who would treat them right.
