One day, when I was still a student at NYU, I was sitting in the common area in the Cinema Studies Department, waiting for a friend, when this girl from one of my classes came and sat down next to me and started talking.  She was very friendly, and I learned that it was her first semester there (I'd already been there for a year) after having transferred in from elsewhere, like me.  She was complaining because she had to go some new students dinner or something that night, that her mother was making her go because she wanted her to make new friends.  She said something about her mom being from Mississippi.  This surprised me since most people that I'd met in New York thus far had barely heard of Mississippi, never mind having met someone from there.  I was so sick of hearing after I told people where I was from that they'd "never met anyone from Mississippi before."  So this was refreshing to say the least, as now I was looking at someone with actual family connections to my birth state.  We got to know each other better over the course of the year, and she eventually told me about the Picnic.  Of course, when I mentioned this radical and seemingly crazy idea to my family, they of course knew all about it and how it was a big deal and usually on the news back home and all.  Funny how they never mentioned it to me.  So, anyways, I've gone for the past three years now, though I haven't had quite as rewarding an experience as I had this year.  Last year it rained, for the first time in the entire history of the Picnic according to my friend.  Her parents are deeply involved in planning for the event, which brings together people originating from Mississippi who now live in the tri-state area and beyond as well as visitors from back home and friends of friends with no other connection to Mississippi at all save the one that brung them.   So today I went and basked in the sun and ate lots of yummy fried chicken and awesome banana pudding.  And I got to visit with Logan and get caught up with her, which was nice since I hadn't talked to her in such a long time.  Because of the rain last year, I didn't get to see her for very long and I hadn't seen her since.  Even though I couldn't stay as long as I would have liked, it was nice to get to spend some time out of doors, in the Park, and hearing lots of people speak in my native tongue - or at least my native accent.    If I'm still here next year, I'll definitely be there again, and I'll try to plan ahead so I can spend more time and get the full experience.  And even if I'm not here, perhaps I'll make a special trip for the occasion.
