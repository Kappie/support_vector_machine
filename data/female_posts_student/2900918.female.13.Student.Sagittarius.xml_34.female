Well, i dont feel lik talkin abt project work(went to the seminar today from morning till evening, and so freakin tired)..  i decided to change my desktop's wallpaper from the purple lightning(i had it on for quite some time) to a scene of blink in a concert and tom is in the front with his gibson, singing. Mark's behind him with tt awesome   pink   bass!! Tom's mouth is open(very sexily).. as usual...  ok, im stuck, so bye for now...
