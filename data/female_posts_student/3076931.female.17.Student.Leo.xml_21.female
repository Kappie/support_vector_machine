I'm almost fucking eighteen years old. i'm so sick of being told "you can't do anything until you clean your room". so yesterday i was like fuck it. so i told her. and i didn't clean my room. one more step toward adulthood....haha.   poetry time!  Laura becomes a poem: hey peter i think you're weetaaded oops i think i just faahhted oh no i think i just caught it. .. a cold...that is.   ----by "shid"
