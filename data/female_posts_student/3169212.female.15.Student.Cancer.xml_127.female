I'll show her one day. She's so wrong about that.      He did?! That's hilarious! I wish I was there to see it!      K, it has nothing to do with reincarnation. It's more of a Lazarus thing, being brought back to life. Reincarnation entails also changing forms, somehow.   Well, apparently, it's fun for some, the whole making others into swiss cheese thing. Again, I shouldn't really comment, but I'm sure Jack can sympathize with you.   		  Do you Yahoo!? Friends.  Fun.  urlLink Try the all-new Yahoo! Messenger
