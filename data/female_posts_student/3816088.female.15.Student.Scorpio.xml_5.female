All day I just sat around on my butt and like didnt do anything but a few chores for my mom and mess around in my game room  trying  to improve my moves for jazz and stuff and it didnt really help any. I still suck!  Then later on I finally got into the shower and Ben picked me up and we went to Barnes and Nobles and got my summer reading books (like im going to read them anyways!) and then just went back to my casa and just talked in my media room. And we just found out some other freaky similarities and i mean freaky ones but yea thats another story! And then of course we had to ttalk to my mom because lord knows he cant come over without my mom talking to him for like 30 minutes about nothing at all! But she did promise that she would get us some aminal crackers for next time! YAY!! Moms do pay off sometimes!  Then around like 6:30 Debbie, the lady I babysit for came and so Ben had to go and I was off to watch the kiddos again. I hadnt seen these kids in like 1 1/2 months man so we had a fun time lemme tell you!! First I walked in the door and I was swarmed! I didnt think I made this much of an impact on these 3 little tots but i obviously did somehow.? We then watched Lion King 1 1/2 and danced to like every song and sang along and all that good stuff. We all had so much fun but then when it came to bed it got ugly!! Little 5 year old Carlton did not like calm down so I warned him I would tell his mom he was being a bad boy(even though i never evenn do) and then he calmed down....man i love those words..."ill tell mom!" And then the like 2 1/2 year old twins are now like big enough that they can get out of their cribs! So i had to watch them carefullly to make sure they didnt get out! It was crazy! But soo much fun. I missed babysitting so much so im happy to be back!!
