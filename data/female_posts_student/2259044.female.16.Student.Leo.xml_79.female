(knocking on wood at this moment) i think the thing i like most about camp is that my regular lifestyle isnt there, and the normal people rn't there and i can escape the drama of life! and when i come back it'll be my b-day and i'll getta take my driving test and hopefully (fingers crossed) i'll pass and be a lisenced driver!! goodness...i need to stop rethinking things, i mean i think about what has been a bitta too much! like it seems my brain has some sorta trigger button for the past, that someone says something or whatever and i think about old things, things that never were, things that were, wutev, i think...and most of the time it's ok, in fact most of the time i think it's a good thing--for a while, as long as i can get the thot thro in regulation time and not be thinking about it for days (which rarely ever happens, i mean the getting it thro thing) i dunno, it's like u go thro life and there r little stops along the way that made you who you are and i like to revisit them but sometimes i feel guilty like i'm not supposed to go back to yesterday and i'm supposed to focus on tomorrow, and i'm a better back-peddler...i mean it's not like i'm going to try and retrace my steps or i'm going to try to make the past the future it's just, i think...i think a lot, and i'm thinking i'm not the only one that thinks fondly of their olden days, i mean u can't convince me that i'm the only person that ever looked over her shoulder! i dunno..i made a neato shirt today, it says "RHINO MINO" i'm soo psyched to wear it, i got a buncha stuff to make other ones too! so hopefully i'll neva have to go shopping...eva! lol cuz i hate shoppping! long post makes for good reads, the bubbles stopped blowing, the fish must be tired, changedfish!
