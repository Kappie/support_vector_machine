RESOLUTIONS: ++ STOP OBSESSING  (hah, what a joke) ++ get better grades (of course) ++ cut my hair (like that's happening) ++ write a story (already did!) ++ stop listening to songs obsessively (hahahahaha) ++ get thinner (that's my mom.  she's making me put it on here.  go away, mom.) ++ get my mom to stop thinking kerry and I are going out (COUGH) ++ watch more movies (I feel miserly) ++ return stuff on time (kai, oil pastels still here...) ++ play neopets more successfully (finally!  one I might be able to keep...) ++ read more good books (finding good books is harder than searching for a needle in a haystack these days) ++ stop making stupid resolutions (gotcha.)  there we go!  now...   best parts of 2003 ++ meeting jack (hehehehe) ++ freshmen orientation (that was fun) ++ walking home with Jackie (ah, the good old days) ++ STATE MATHCOUNTS (the best two days of my life) ++ mock trial!!

SLEEPovers... sure) ++ kai's mom's potatoes!  (yum) ++ ENSEMBLE!!!!  (nuff said) ++ meeting ms. kite (becuz she is the bestest teacher ever.  except for mrs. s)  there we go!  worst parts of 2003: ++ EXAMS ++ STARTING HIGH SCHOOL ++ END OF ENSEMBLE  I think that's it.  hehehehe.  alright!  A lot has happened since Dec. 30... so here's a HUUUUGE update!  alright.     wednesday , I stayed home and played neopets.  as usual.  then, my mom came home and we went to a party.  new years party and all that jazz, ya know.  so we went.  we went to jihai (right?)'s house, and... I got bored.  severely bored.  and tian was there.  so we went and asked our parents if we could come to my house.  and they said yes.  so tian came over.  I didn't wanna bring her, but she was just kinda... there, so she came.  yeah.  and let me tell you, she is THE most annoying girl EVER.  tracee, meet tian.  I mean... she is even more GPA whorish than tracey.  and that's saying something.  OH MY GOSH...  yeah.  so she came, and we watched ocean's eleven.  cuz she hadn't seen that before.  so then after that, we drew pictures.  cuz she wanted to.  yeah.  and she was SO TOTALLY comparing me to herself.  Every few seconds she was like, "Let me see what you're doing."  So I let her see.  and uuuugh.  I just drew stick figures after a while, cuz I don't like my pictures being compared with other ppl's.  (btw, mine was WAY better.  XD  I'll scan them in later if I have time.)  Yeah.  then later we went to my room and just did stuff.  I've forgotten what.  And she tried to learn how to do the ribbon stuff I do.  ha!  she failed miserably.  And then...  we went online.  and she went on my brother's computer.  and she just did stuff.  she changed the background so it's a picture of the moon now with her poem on it.  gosh.  her stupid ugly poem.  my zen poetry is SO much better.  XDD  and then she got online and talked to ppl and she was all, "Do you know gary?  he goes to jasper." and trying to make it seem like she's more popular than me or something.  psh.  stupid.  (if you can't tell, I really don't like her much.)  so then we were online until like 1.30 or something in the morning, and then she went into my room and wanted to do calligraphy, so I refilled my pens with ink and just as I got the pen working, her mom FINALLY picked her up and she was gone.  she was over from like 7.30 to 2.  that is a freakishly long time to be with someone you don't like much.  yeah.  then my parents came home, too, with my brother, who was playing with jihai and tian's brother.  so then my brother went to sleep while I went to my parent's bedroom and talked to them until 3.30 in the morning.  my mom finished crocheting my scarf!  and then they went to sleep while I came upstairs and reread the perilous gard.  which is a VERY good book, btw.  then it was like 5.30 and the sky was turning pink and I went to sleep.   thursday , new years day, I didn't get up until 12 because I slept so late.  and even then I was stumbling around all sleepy and everything.  my parents took me to the collin creek gap b/c of the lacy shirt thing I wanted, and I got one.  it's light pink with stripes!  and then I got another spaghetti strap thing cuz it was so cheap it'd be blasphemous not to buy it.  according to my mom, anyways.  it's not even my size (it's my mom's size... but we can basically wear each other's clothes so it doesn't matter much).  so yeah.  and then we went to dillard's and my mom and I both got a new pair of tennis shoes... they're exactly the same.  except for the size.  which are half a size apart.  (there was a 8.5 and a 9, and since my mom has slightly smaller feet than me, she got the 8.5 one and I got the 9.)  and they're marvelously lazy shoes and they're so cuuuute.  yup.  and then we stopped by mei hua and got some food... and at that time my parents decided to invite ppl to our house for new years!  and I freaked cuz I was like I DON'T WANT TO SEE TIAN GODDARNIT.  yeah.  but it turned out that they already got invited to another place, but jihai was gonna come, as well as these two little girls, so it meant I was free to stay in my room all evening as long as I said a "hi" when they first came.  so that's what I did.  I fell asleep rereading rebecca (heh) and so then my mom came to wake me up when kerry called.  and kerry called to ask me to go over to his house (wow, I did that a lot this break) cuz he was having another huge asian gathering thing.  so I went over.  (I ditched my parents' party for kerry's.  what a bad daughter I am.)  oh, the story behind the kerry's calling thing is this: my mom picked up the phone and kerry asked to speak to me.  my mom called me (she didn't know I was asleep) and then she hung up (after she asked him to come over to our house.. except he couldn't cuz he had to be the host or whatever of the younger kids).  cuz there were lots of ppl downstairs.  and I didn't pick up.  and then kerry called again and asked to speak to me again, and then my mom realized that I didn't pick up the first time.  yeah.  so anyhow, I went over sans my brother, and OH MY GOD there were OCEANS of ppl there.  yeah.  and kerry's mom saw me and was like, "Sunshine!  EAT!"  so she gave me a plate and put like thousands of pounds of food on there and I was like, "oookay then".  then to escape the questioning eyes (there were a lot), I went upstairs with the rest of the non-adults (they're not really kids... cuz lots of them were on break from college and if you're in college, you're not a kid) and watched friends and ate.  and watched little boys (elementary schol age) play DOA3 and exclaim over the "hot girls" and "I SAW HER UNDERWEAR!"  and such.  yeah.  there were like 20 non-adults and at least twice as many adults in that house.  it was pandemonium.  and then after a while, the middle-aged non-adults (aka me, rena, eileen, kerry, david) got bored and we went on AIM!  which was... funny.  cuz eileen signed on, then she went downstairs, and kerry and david and I took over her account...  hehehehehehehe.  and there was this girl she hated, stepho aka bringmepinkroses, and so kerry got onto zuiquandrunkard and started dissing her like heck.  "your mom's like a brick... she's short, fat, and gets laid by mexican workers"  yeah. stuff like that.  it was very interesting and VERY funny.  even though it was a bit mean.  and since he has deadaim, he could clone AIM, and so there were like 5 ppl on at once, and we were all talking to ppl and dissing them and such...  yeah.  it's not that funny unless you're there...  lol.  yeah.  rena is SOOOO freakishly thin.  goooosh.  and there was this boy, justin, age 10 or something, who WOULD NOT STOP TOUCHING MY HAIR.  it was the freakiest thing EVER.  (even worse than jeff chang...  ::shudder::).  yeah...  and I went home at midnight and talked to my parents some more and went to sleep.   friday , today, I woke up at 12.30 cuz my mom woke me up.  ate chicken soup and began blogging.  it's taking me like 1.5 hours to type this because my space bar is gone again so ALL the spaces you see are copy/pasted.  and it takes forever to paste every single space.  (my pinky hurts like freak.)  and now I'm gonna go to walmart to buy more yarn!  alright bye everyone!  freaky long entry...  see, I like blogging at blogger cuz only you two know the addy so I can actually write what I feel...  instead of at xanga where you hafta watch your every word.   though the feedback there is ego-boosting.  XDD  right.  bye now!  ++sunny
