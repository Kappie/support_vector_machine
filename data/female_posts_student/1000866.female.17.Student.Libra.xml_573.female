I feel pretty good about my satire and comedy final though. I really do. I was ready. I had like...a four page outline. I actually prepared. It felt kind of nice being prepared....  I should try that again sometime. The reality of it is that it probably wont happen for another ten years but maybe...just maybe it'll happen sooner.   I haven't written a real entry in so long for me. I've missed not writing in here. A lot's going on right now too. Most of it I can't really talk about in here but...still. It's nice to have blogger back to vent some frustrations. I think I'm giving up on numero 3. I don't think I care enough anymore as odd as it sounds. I don't know. Maybe this is all just because I'm having a particularily bad week but still, I'm feeling like I'm not going to bother with it anymore. I don't even feel right liking him. It's just making me feel weird now.   Anyway, today I went out to lunch with Kelly, Kath, and MC. Good times. So much fun at Noodles. And tonight, I think I'm going to go to that dance thing at school with them. I have to be there to make sure Kathryn does what she's supposed to do.   I guess now I'll go...I don't know. There's no homework to do and...WOW! This is amazing. There's nothing to do and I love that. I think I'll go watch TV. That's fun and I haven't done that in a long time.    In spite of my crappy week which will probably exceed crappy tomorrow...I'm content at this instant and it's a nice feeling.
