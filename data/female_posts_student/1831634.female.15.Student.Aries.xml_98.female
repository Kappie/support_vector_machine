And your birthright to a less stressful existance than mine.  I hate my brother. So much. I can't even begin to describe it in words. (Later I will read this post and realize what a stupid, selfish bitch I'm being right now, but that's later.)  It's just a petty jealousy issue, I suppose. And I'm going to sound so conceited and arrogant for writing such things, but you know what? If I can't write it out in a blog, then where can I express it? (A real diary, I know, but I'm too lazy to handwrite the whole entry out.) So this will just have to suffice.  Why do parents always dote on the younger sibling? Why do they think the older one is just automatically more capable of taking care of himself? Just because we came into being first doesn't mean we're in any less need of their attentions. Yes, this whole thing is just around an attention issue. I'm an idiot. An insecure one, at that.  I could go into incruciating detail, but then you'll probably just despise me more, so I won't.  I also hate Jack with a passion right now, so if you could not mention his name around me, it'd be much appreciated.  And don't even ask about that one.    On a brighter note: I drove today! With the driving school instructor. I actually had to drive on a REAL ROAD at 40mph. I was scared out of my wits.  Yini: Buttercup and Wesley! Very cute. I approve. Picture takes an eternity and a half to load, though.  Meng: I don't know how you manage to stay sane with a younger brother.  Kailing: You lucky goose. You ought to be dressed and paraded about.    And that's the end of that.
