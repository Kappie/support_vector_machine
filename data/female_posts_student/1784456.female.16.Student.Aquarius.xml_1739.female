Fun for winding people up with though *not that i have...* It actually a lump of ice-cream covered in chocolate and extra bits so you get this really hard lump that's inedible. *i guess describing it like that didn't help* Eeek I think I might end my blog here before it gets worse... *i also have to go do stuff. i really do have a life you know!* (Yeah right.)
