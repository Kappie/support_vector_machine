Moving from place to place The task is to find out who you are Each of us look for our own space Even if it means we wish on a star.  We look to the Heavens in search of an answer The question i am sure you know well, they are of life, death and meaning Why does SHE have to have cancer? Or even, why aren't YOU there intervening?  Its from our journeys we learn to love Its from our journeys we learn to look to the above.
