Then again, it's been my day off, as well as my rest and recover from Monday day. Which means that I slept a good ten hours.  I attained some of my goals for the day: got in my five servings of fruit and vegetables (a banana, and lots of edamame!), and my six servings of water (actually got in eight-I use a 44 oz. thermal mug), but I didn't get in my exercise, no, instead I took a break and watched 5 episodes of "X-Files" on DVD before returning them to Netflix.  Yes, I am not always cerebral, although I think I have one of my professors convinced that I'm just shy of being out of my mind...something about taking Ancient Greek, Latin, and German this autumn semester. What can I say, I don't like being board. :-)  This bit is just for me, an accounting to myself:    Breakfast:  5.5points  1 serving Honey Bunches of Oats Cereal (2 points) 1/2 cup of 2%milk(1.5 points) medium banana (2 points)     Lunch:  10.5 points  Peter Pan Reduced Fat Peanut Butter (1 Tbsp) (2.5 points) Jelly (1 Tbsp) (1 point) Healthy Life Whole Wheat Bread (2 pieces) (1 point) Edamame (3 servings) (6 points)    Dinner:  18 points  Jacks Cheeseburger Pizza (2 servings) (12 points) Edamame (3 servings) (6 points)    34 points total  8 servings water 7 servings fruits and vegetables 1.5 servings milk    Current weight:  (at least according to Lloyd's brother's scale)  240 lbs ...it might be 237, but the damn print is so small between each 10 lb. segment. This means I've lost between 5 and 8 pounds since last week.
