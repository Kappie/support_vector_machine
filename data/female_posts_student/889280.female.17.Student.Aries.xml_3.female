(Big John, Big John) Big Bad John.  Nobody seems to know what's in John's soul His 'beliefs' are based on the latest poll Though he'll say what it takes to get your votes It's the leftist agenda that he really promotes Big John.  Some one said he came from Boston town Where he joined the Navy and gained renown 'Earning' three purple hearts and one bronze star The home folks said, "This boy will go far" (Big John, Big John) Big Bad John (Big John)  Then came a day back in '71 When he renounced all the medals that he had won Then turned against his country and his Navy friends And sold them out for his own selfish ends (Big John)  He appeared before Congress and on left-wing talk shows Giving aid and comfort to America's foes It was clear to see whose side he was on Some say he helped cause the fall of Saigon Big John. (Big John, Big John) Big Bad John (Big John).  He claims to be for the working poor Yet he owns 5 mansions from shore to shore He never had to work a day in his life 'Cause he learned it helps to have a wealthy wife! Big John  Now he wants to be our next President and Commander-in-chief of those he resents: The American soldiers who fight and die To give him the freedom to tell us his lies (Big John, Big John) Big Bad John (Big John)  Thousands have sacrificed their young lives To help ensure that our nation survives A vote for Kerry is a slap in the face To all the brave soldiers that he's disgraced (Big John, Big John) Big Bad John (Big John)  I found those on the internet.. haha funny. ^
