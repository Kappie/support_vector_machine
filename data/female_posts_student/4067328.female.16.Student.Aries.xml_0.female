(no offense mere). i just get that feeling sometimes like i'm just watching my life pass me by and not really living it.        wow.. sorry this blog has been so depressing        heres a hopefully inspirational quote for ur evening: "i can sum up everything i've learned about life in three words: it goes on"        peace out!!
