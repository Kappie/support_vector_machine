You know that feelign of sucess that you hold when you think you have finally acheive something u were never meant to achieve..  only to  realize later on that it was a load of bullshit and everything uve done in the past was only a path of lies? You obtain glory, pride and hope.. yet you always have that sense of doubt, that hint of fear of failure which eventually finally releases itself unblinding you and open you up to the reality.. You thot you were finally going somewhere with life.. but you were only walking in place.
