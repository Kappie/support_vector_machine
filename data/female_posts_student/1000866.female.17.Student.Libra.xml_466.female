Plus, everyone has access to it when it's on my profile, so it's like anyone can read what I say. I'm not really sure i like that. I think I can put this thing on privacy and then people just can't get into it without a password. I guess I could try that, but I'm not sure yet. I'm sort of deciding. I'm ambivalent. YaY sat/com buzz words.
