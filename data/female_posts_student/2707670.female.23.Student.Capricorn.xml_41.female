I thought I did great and then she sent out the answers and things went down hill from there. I do appreciate the love though. Michelle, I hope you have the bestest time in Cali. I wish I could be going with you!   In other news this has been like the longest week of my life and I don't want to do anything for the rest of the week so I spent several hours this morning reading  urlLink THIS.  It was totally awesome and funny but I didn't enjoy the ending very much. Sounds a lot like something some boys I know would do to someone (apt 245). It could be newest experiment but I think they would have to set up Brendan which could prove difficult since he is at MIT with a bunch of smart people. Just an idea boys.   While we are on the subject of Apt 245. I have to say that I have been disappointed with the amount of blogs. I mean going a week between doesn't win you any points and what the heck was with that "thing" John posted it was awful. I would also like to know where Sean found his because it wasn't much better. I have to say if it was a war we should win for lack of amazingly stupid things posted!
