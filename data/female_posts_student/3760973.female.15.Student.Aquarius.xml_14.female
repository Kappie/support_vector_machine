Okay. Lemme see if I can get this crap straight:   Week One:  First day, we just did some acting theory, like acting from the inside out and expressing ourselves without words. Then we did Space Stuff, which was basically imaginary objects- with details. Like: It's not just a balloon. It's a bright red balloon filled with helium, etc. etc. Because generality is the enemy of acting, pretty much. And we came up with the idea (since everyone was always saying it) to do an improv on Shut up, Charles. The third day we did an exercise with adding people to scenes without  speaking. We did one major scene. Okay, so here's how it went.    Natalie: *at an ice cream place, scooping ice cream* Me: *comes up as a little child and buys some ice cream, slurping loudly* Karrah: *joins me as a child*  Daniel: *a cop, sits reading a newspaper, before getting up and getting some ice cream* Karrah and I: *switch ice cream cones to taste the other's before going and bothering Cop!Dan*  Dan: *refuses to taste our ice cream cone and shoves Karrah*  Cassie and Sam: *get some ice cream as a couple* Karrah: *gets ice cream on her shirt, needs a napkin* Charles: *comes in as a mailman with a package, knocks me over and I lose my ice cream cone so Karrah gives me hers* Meghan: *bursts in and starts robbing the ice cream store*  Charles: *flings a box at Meg and gets shot*  Me: *tackles Meg and gets shot* Cassie, Sam, Karrah, Kira: *hide in the back, call the cops* Dan: *tries to stop the robbery, gets shot*  Natalie: *gives the Meg some ice cream* Me and Charles: *come back as Zombies and chase the robber around*   And scene. XDDD   Week 2:  Oh, wow. Uh. Yeah! I remember now. That Monday we did expressing ourselves with our backs and Hands and Feet.  Wednesday: Gibberish day! We all spoke in Gibberish, translating only by body and inflection. We had several scenes.   GROUP 1 Rachel: Madama Zlowskyie, a national dance team leader. Kira: Her translator  GROUP 2 Daniel: A famous chef from Lintoneania, showing us how to make 'Special Hot Ice Cream Baked Mixture' ((Ingredients: Ice cream, apples, milk, strawberries, whipped cream, chili peppers)) Karrah: His translator ((A classic line from that scene: Q: "You chopped up the apples, but you didn't add them. Do you add them after it's baked?" A: *translated from Lintoneanese* I did add the apples! I'm just too fast for you to see!"))  GROUP 3 Lily: Leader of the Mirkionian Desert Bobsled Team (with Jack, her imaginairy friend) Meghan: Her translator ((Another classic quote. *translated* "We're a desert bobsled team, yes. But we're not worried about those stupid Jamaicans. All that pot, you know, just goes to their heads. Our team smokes opium. It's much better.))  GROUP 4/5 A scene from a Tonienitik Film, winner of the Rochinki Award, Dubbed. Just before the famous steamy sex scene. This scene is where the main characters realize they are meant for each other. XD Me: Lorena, a cellist who is engaged to... not Kikiu. Sam: My translator Charles: Kikiu, falls in love with Lorena.  Julianne: His translator.  ((AHAH! This is where the 'Fwaht!?' Comes from. Charles's gibberish for 'What'?))  And then Friday, we did: Who, what, where. We had several partners, all with the same what and where, just different who's.   Group 1: in a shoe Karrah: Adolescent boy, climbing a tree Sam: Jackie Chan  Group 2: At a football game Natalie: A shoelace, popping pills Kira: A peach ((A few well placed puns with her!   Group 3: On a subway Lily: A pirate, trying to sleep. (("Argggh. My cousin Hook would know what to do, eh Polly?")) Dan: A frenchman. ((All he got out before the scene ended was "Bonjour, madame.")) ((This also spawned Lily's final line: "Arrrgh. I hate frenchmen."))  Group 4: In a swimming pool Cassie: A loaf of bread, choking. Meghan: Don Giovanni! (the greatest womanizer/lover of all time) ((XD This spawned "What are you doing -here-, you sweet, soggy peice of toast, you?"   Group 5: At a strip club Me: A sock, being executed Julianne: Santa Claus (("OH-ho-ho! That ain't no Missus Claus!" and then my "Oooh! No! Don't take the stockings OFF!"))   WEEK 3:   Monday was a hard lesson, doing text and subtext. I made someone cry in a scene by saying 'I hate you'. O.O It was really freaky, when it's done right, it's like someone's punched you in the stomach.  Anyway. TODAY! Today was Objective Day. XD We all had to get our objectives across without directly saying it. My objective was to get my toes sucked on. XD   Anyway, the only one I really remember was mine with Rachel's. ((Rachel was trying to get me to recite poetry.))   Me: So how was your day? Rachel: Good, good. I walked around the park, hearing the lovers say beautiful things to each other, with my coffee...  Me: Ah, coffee. That would explain why your teeth are yellow. Rachel: Oh dear. They are? I need to go brush my teeth... Me: Well, you know, my toes have built in toothbrushes...  That was just an excerpt. But yeah. XDDDDD  I love acting class. There are so many other amusing things that happen, just ask me about them sometime.  I'm:FREAKIN//amused.  Alias:ELLE//fin.
