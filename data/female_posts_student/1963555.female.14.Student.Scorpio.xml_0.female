Now until "I learn my leason" or take it back I'm gonna be in a bitchy mood! but then again I just saw them in consert saturday and I still should be on the post-consert high so never mind all that! But ya know what I have an H2O cd down here anyways so I'll just pop that in instead! HAAAA HAAAAAAAA Mom! Anyway, If you guys are looking for a good band def. pick up H2O's Go. It's a great cd! Also Movielife is pretty good too (they both were @ the SkateFest)! So I forgot to tell you about one of the hottest things David did!! I couldn't belive me! at the end of the show he did his last note and threw up his bass and just let it slam on the stage! UGHHHHHH Awesome!!!! It was soooooooo hot!!! GOD!!!!!!!! I really love them even more than ever!!! UGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Man it was soooooo fricken awesome! OHHHHHHHHHH! so yeah I still have 3 reports due like the 15th and I'm actually gonna work on them! WOW! so I'll talk to you sexy guys a little later! Ha HA! bye
