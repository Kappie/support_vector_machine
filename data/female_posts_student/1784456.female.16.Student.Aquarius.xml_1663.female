I came up with the fantastic suggestion of watching the Ghostbusters Video that Katie has and listening to the music repetativly, untill u can copy it.  That way all u have to pay is Katie for all the food you eat, and Katie's parents have to pay the electric bill. Sorted!!! I've been having a fun day, went down the cdt sqd this afternoon and did some demolishing, and moving and binning.  I did media this morning, and have been talking to Ian on the phone, what a fun day.  OOOOOOOOO I dislike this haily weather, it hurts your head!!! xx
