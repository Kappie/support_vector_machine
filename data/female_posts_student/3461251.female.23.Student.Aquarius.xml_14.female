But why's it feel like I have to loss weight in order to find that self-love in myself? Ugh!  "Sometimes in your life you will go on a journey. It will be the longest journey you have ever taken. It is the journey to find yourself." -Katherine Sharp  I just liked this one because it seems so true.  "Difficult times have helped me to understand better than before how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever." - Isak Denesen  With all that I've been through in the last few years of my life - That quote couldn't be any truer(if that's even a word). It's funny though... How much you can realize about the life around you during the worst times of your life. I guess my parents did well when they taught us to always look at the brighter side of things, or realize things aren't has bad has you think, or... the list can go on and on.  However, I must get to sleep now! Sweet Dreams!
