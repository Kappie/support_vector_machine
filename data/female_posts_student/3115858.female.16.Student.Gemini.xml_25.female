I'M SO PSYCHED!!!!!!!  errmm, well. the new everclear.  who knows...they might be halfway decent (still).  i'm becoming more enamored every day with the postal service.  i love their music.  i'm also teaching (what i think is radiohead's ultimate masterpiece)   paranoid android   to myself.  i'm kinda proud of that.  okay.
