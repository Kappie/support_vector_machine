As you may have guessed, today was one of those down in the dumps days, and I don't even know why!    I just felt mad at everyone, and so lethargic the whole day. Thank God though the feeling has passed and I'm ready to be all happy and cheerful tomorrow! :) I'm going back to my hometown this weekend (Penang), so I'll get to miss tuition class which is another bonus! Hehehe...    And although tomorrow I'm enrolling for extra Maths classes at school, I still feel surprisingly light and happy! Yay!    Amelia
