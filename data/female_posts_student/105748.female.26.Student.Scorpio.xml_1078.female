The studios in San Francisco will be closing and 100 of the existing jobs will be posted for staffers that are willing to relocate to LA.  My hope is that  urlLink Mr. Pirillo  has been keeping an eye on this news flash and is filling in for a position in L.A. right at this moment.  Sigh, one can only hope.
