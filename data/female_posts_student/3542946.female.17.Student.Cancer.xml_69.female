Well, why not go in there and publicise McDonald's, after all, it is the healthiest food around. Celebrity footballers were paid to come to our schools and talk about ways in which to lose weight and become fit. Some of this plan led to the recommendation of McDonald's family restaurants as an aid to the fitness program. Now, I'd like to think that I'm not just having a cheap shot at McDonald's here as that would be contraindicated, but honestly, and especially after the release of Super Size Me (which im yet to see, but I understand it was scary enough for Maccas to have to release an advert campaign to protect themselves by pointing our their understanding of the misinterpretations that this doco may have conveyed). What was the real plan behind this odd occurrence? Is there any plan at all? Is this discrimination against the local businesses of Australia that also supply fast food? What does the government have to gain by backing this hodiernal recommendation. And I also would have expected more from some footballers, I hope it was genuine, and not simply for the money. Any thoughts?
