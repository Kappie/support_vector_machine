This is when I am most like my true self, so when people compliment me during these times it means the most to me.  The worst thing someone could say to me is that they hate my laugh.  I laugh all the time...it is such an integral part of my life.  I would be so self concious if all the time I was doubting my laugh.  On another note I'm planning on drinking with Nick...sounds like fun!
