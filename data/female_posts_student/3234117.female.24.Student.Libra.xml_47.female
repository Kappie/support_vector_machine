I thought I had a good idea to wear my bathing suit top under my shirt when I went and worked out so when I finished I could just go right out to the pool.  Bad idea.  I had to hold my bathing suit top up the whole time I was running for support.  I don't have big boobs or anything, but man just remember for future reference not to run in a tube top.  It's great for tan lines, bad for running.  Mental note.  Do not turn in graduate level work that is not typed.  Normally I wouldn't, but I was coerced.  Not really, but my classmate said she was going to turn her's in handwritten so being the follower I am, I decided to as well.  Also, watch out for pronouns.  I don't even know what those are, but watch out for them!  When you are typing about a "she" make sure you type out "she" and not "their" and "has" instead of "have".  And also instead of typing "may be faking good".  Type "may have underreported psychopathology". Where's an editor when I need one? :)  Mental note.  Stop dressing like ass.  For the past almost two months I have dressed like ass.  It's more fun to dress up when you have someone to dress up for.  Although I think I'm going about this all wrong.  For the second time I've run into this guy that lives on my floor looking like ass.  Well, the first time I think I looked decent, which is good because I met his friends.  Okay, well I happened to be in the elevator at the same time as them and we talked.  I didn't really meet them.  Then today, looking like ass again, I see the guy again.  Today I really looked hot.  I had on an old Southwest Texas t-shirt, blue work out shorts, a hat, and flip flops.  I had on no make-up and I'm sure still had the remnats of black mascara under my eyes as I was too lazy to get it all off.  But what did I care, I was going to campus.  No hot guys there.  We actually did talk on the elevator.  He's pretty cute.  Kind of nerdy, but I like those types.  It's best for the guy to be hot, but not know he's hot.  So anyway, I should probably stop dressing like ass.  Mental note.  Take better notes on what I've read.  I had class yesterday and I probably scored a 2 out of 10.  Not so good.  Especially since I already got a 5 on the first quiz, which I planned to drop.  My friend and I were joking in class that if we answered "yes" to the question that asked if it was possible for a client to present an inaccurate self-description on the MMPI and if so, why, would we get 1 point?  I would hope.  I gave an explanation, but it was wrong.  I did, however, say yes.  I felt pretty good about the quiz we got back yesterday though.  I got a 9 out of 10 and the class mean was only a 6.5.  Good job, Rebecca!    No more mental notes.
