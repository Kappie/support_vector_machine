I switched over from livejournal.com, because I've been informed that this site is cram-jam packed (mmm...cram jam...) with non-lackey goodness whilst the other site is not. So here I am. LOVE ME! Well, don't, because by doing so you will have started a nuclear war...If you don't know, don't ask.   I hate people. I really do. This probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense to you, or you think it does, but it really doesn't because you're interpreting it the wrong way. But. I do hate people. Someone'll talk to me. Sure, I'll talk back. But I still hate them. I'm saying this while you're keeping in mind that friends, when they become friends, don't 'count' as people anymore. They're friends. I'm finished ranting now.  In TAG, for "Treat Friday", Mr.(Insert lackey pre-intern which I hate's name here) brought everyone waffles. Waffles. WAFFLES! JESUSCHRISTMEANDASHLEYNEARLYHADACONEPTION. *twitch* ...Uh, and I'm not going to tell you why that's disturbing. and last week we had cake. JESUSCHRISTIFITWASMANGLECAKEMEANDASHLEY'SHEADSWOULD'VEEXPLODED. Okk. I'm done now.  So. My mother is useless. Utterly useless. We went to Long and McQuade after school to pick up my drumkit, right? (It gets better...) and we got it, and on the way home we stopped at this Godly store (I...don't think it has a name, but I have a story about it...it's creepy) and I bought a prickly spike bracelet (!!!). Anyway. So we get home and I say to her, "So...when are we setting up the drumkit?" "We? No, no. You can set the damn thing up whenever you want to." "Oh, well thanks, MOM!" "...Get me a beer."  Ok so story time. I'm in this store (My mother abandoned me temporarily) and there's this old man in there ranting on about how punks are the devil and don't trust people with chains, etc... (I think he must've been senile. He was in a punk store.) and buddy just keeps eyeing me down and watching my every move. So the person that works there is showing me a bunch of bracelets and I'm like "but wouldn't the leather crack over time?" then buddy comes up to me and he's like "See, what you do is, when you go to bed at night, (buddy grabs one of my bracelets and starts rubbing it) you rub some vaseline or something like that" I got all disturbed, grabbed my hand and I was like "OK THANKS THEN. YEAH MY HAND."  I. Can't. Wait. Til. May 25. *twitch* Why? I'll tell you......IT'S THE DAY OF THE DISTILLERS CONCERT!!!! IT'S GOING TO KICK FUCKING ASS. MY CAR IS NOT WHERE I PARKED IT, MY CAR IS NOT WHERE I PARKED IT!!!! *SINGS* Erm...It would probably be better if you didn't ask. Erm. I don't suppose it matters whether or not you ask, seeing as I'm not going to tell you either way. Anywhoo's. I'm bored and tired and...bye.
