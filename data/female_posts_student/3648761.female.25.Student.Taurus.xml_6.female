Friday, I had a little too much drink, but met some pretty cool people at the festival. Saturday, I slept as much as I could only 5 Hours then I ran some errands and headed back to Lucky's Fest. Saturday I brought my sister, And she had a lot of fun. She had some PDA going on with one of my friends. They kept thanking me for introducing them to one another. It was hilarious. At First she was mad at me, I kept telling her about my friend how nice he is, and cute, blah, blah. She kept insisting that she doesn't want to meet anyone, because she had a bad breakup recently, blah, blah. Then I introduced them and the first word out of her mouth is" HI, I'm sady, and I am single!". They actually had their first date yesterday. I love playing match maker. Yesterday, I relaxed all day, cleaned and caught up on sleep. Two days of drinking and partying really takes a toll on you. Well my job searchs continues. I had an interview today, but it didn't go very well. I really need to find a job soon, to save up some money for books. I want to get books for school before the end of june so that I can get the used ones. I am excited about starting school. I can't beleive I am going back to school September 1.
