Friday, August 6, 2004       Well, Friday was good day. I woke up early so I could go get my hair cut. So as I was getting my hair cut my mom and I begin to talk like what should we do while dad and Leah are at Pensecola. My suggested we go to Evansville cause she has family their and she wanted to take pictures of some graves for her genealogy project. I then remind her we don't have that much money. She said we can just pack up the cooler and sleep in the car if we need to. Well, then I thought if we have enough money to do that in Evansville we can surely make it to Kenosha,WI. Kenosha is like home to us. The lighthouses there, the nice wavy Lake Michigan, and the yumilicious Jelly Belly Factory. So mom agreed. I WAS SO EXCITED!!!!! So we pack some stuff of use, pick up some ice, and get somemoney out of the bank...and we were off. While travelling, mom realizes we would probably hit Chicago during rush-hour. So she plans on taking the interstate a little farther out around the city. That was probably the biggest mistake ever. The interstate was crowded. I didn't know that many people could fit in such a tiny area. Not only was it crowded, there were like toll roads after toll roads. Mom begins to ask me to read the map in what roads she can get on to and then we can finally get to our destination.  It seemed like once I just said get off the interstate we were there in no time. Ahh, it was such a wonderful experience. Too bad we got there like at 6 that evening. So we cruised around a bit. Kenosha was having a tall ships festival. It was awesome. Those ships with all those sails, then the nice breeze of the water, and the sun setting. Ahh, picture perfect. So then after that we drove some more. I can't believe I forgot to mention this. But just south of Kenosha, and over the border to Illinois, there is the Great Lakes Naval Base. WOWZERS! That means you can see guys in uniform all the time. They are adorable. Even the Mexicans make the uniform look good. So anywho, we drove around checked that out. But back in Kenosha, we had planned to sleep in the car in this parking lot that overlooked the water. We had everything in the car situated and were just sitting talking until we got sleeping. Then all of a sudden my mom is like ugh what is that smell. I said it wasn't me. Come to find out it was a skunk. That skunky smell made us leave. So then we were confused on where we should stay. Mom did say we could get a cheapy hotel room. But every sign up there said no vacancy. So by that time it was 12:30am. We decide we will just come back home. So we drove back from there from 12:30am to 4:15am. Phew, what a long night it was.       Saturday,August 7, 2004         Well, around 5:30am I finally got some sleep. Some circumstances kept me up longer than expected. So then I slept until probably 11, got up and made a phone call to see if I was going to have plans later that evening. Finally about 2, the phone kept ringing no stop. Joshua calls to say he is on his way to get a disk, Asim keeps calling cause he has no life and wants his no in everyone's business, and then finally William calls to say we are going to a movie. I tell William to be here at 5. Before he got here, I managed to take a shower, and eat some pizza. Then he got to my house. We sat and talked for an hour and half. Then went to go see the movie. I got to see The Little Black Book. That was an interesting movie. Doesn't turn out the way you would have expected. But I liked it alot. Anywho, the movie ended by 9:30 and so we went back to his house to get some pictures that he had taken of me like months ago. He was slow at getting them developed. After that, coming off the interstate he asks if I would want to go to the canal. Of course, I agreed. We got to the canal by 10:15. The weather last night was gorgeous and being downtown helped me get away from the race crowd in the neighborhood.  We walked around, sat around and talked while we were at the canal.  Then around 11:45 (which I thought was what my watch said) we left and made it home. Well, walking in the door to my house showed I read my watch wrong. It was 12:15am. Curfew is at twelve. Oops! It was seriously a completed accident. It's not like I did it on purpose. So that led to my mom printing out another rules sheet. Sheesh.Well, William stayed and hung out for awhile and then left at 1. I went to my room at fell fast asleep. Ahh, it was lovely.       NOW, today...well it is Brickyard Sunday! Traffic is crazy, the people are crazy. But I love race days. Cause right over my street is where the military jets come by. It is an awesome sight. I have grown up getting excited for it. Today, Leah and dad plan on returning also. Things are a bit crazy around this Prosch house...sheesh. But I plan to make this a good Sunday!      Ok, I think you got the general idea of what I did on my days while I was absent. So sorry, once again for not writing on time. Well until next time, I am outtie!
