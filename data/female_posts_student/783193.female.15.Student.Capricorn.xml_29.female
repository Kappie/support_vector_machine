We practiced and recorded our quartet, minus Jane, who left her music in her music folder that was in her cello case that was in the orchestra room that was at school. So we just kind of.. played through it a couple of times. So anyway, both Jane and Arom left, and I didn't want to leave, so we went out to walk with Choco in a library bag to the bottom of Mt. Lassen, where "my house" is supposed to be. I was wearing flip flops, so that's why my feet are dirty. So anyway, when we were walking down, Jessica saw this car, and was like, "Hey Madrianne, look at that weird car." Oh, my goodness. It was a Hummer! After eating her out about how it was probably the awesome-est car in the world, and not weird at all, we took a peek through the tinted windows. It was really, really, really nice. That wasn't all, though. The house was like, not that big, but the yard was really well-furnished, and there was a new Mercedes on the side of the driveway, and an antiqued Impala (she was like, "Hey Madrianne, look at that old car.") next to the Hummer. And then, we saw this dog in their backyard which, as far as we could see beyond the fence, was perfect, and she was like, "Hey Madrianne, look at that cute dog." Then, when we were looking at the dog, four more of the same breed came to the fence! We just stood there for a while in shock, watching them wag their tails at us. Then, when we could stand the wealthiness of the people living there (whom we didn't even see), we huffed and puffed back up. Choco stayed calm the whole time. Jessica and I did not. We were too busy trying to deal with our seething jealousy. Just kidding. We were just a little disgruntled. I haven't updated in a while, so I'll write little summaries of events. Yesh, yesh.Tuesday: -Bounced around with Cissy at her house and made really yummilicious drinks. Mixed by me, by the way. Recipe- 1/4 cup of Tropical Fruit nectar, 1/4 cup of Aloe Farm, and 1/2 cup of Coke. If it looks a pukey brown color, good. It's pretty disgusting-looking, but once you get over it, it's pretty tasty!Wednesday: -Practice, practice, practice and Ro's house. We were pretty rusty at first, but soon, we were getting into it. We weren't together, so we got into this yelling-out-every-five-measures thing, which was hilarious, one, because you had to yell it really, really loud to hear it above the music, and two, because Jane was eating all this candy, and when she yelled out "Ten!", this plum one went flying out of her mouth, and Jessica practically collapsed laughing. We all were pretty much rolling around on the floor. Then, to make it even worse, I really had to pee, because laughing just makes me pee. I burst into the bathroom, but little did I know, Richard, Ro's brother, had come home from school, and was apparently in the bathroom. So there I was, gasping for air, stomach muscles clenched, and shaking uncontrollably from laughing, running in on one of my best friend's brothers in the bathroom. Oh boy. There's more. Jane went home, and Jessica, Ro, and I were left, so we ate half a gallon of banana ice cream and went outside to play with our shadows, during which Jessica told farting stories. Good times.-Piano teacher was upset because I missed seven problems on my theory test, when I could have missed, like, twenty-five and passed. Thursday: -Listened to Anna, Chen, and Jane act out part of their court trial while helping Mr. S. It was really funny, especially as the victim acted as the judge, also, because there were only three people. Guess who was overruled all the time?-Had our own trial in 5°. Michael, one of our defending attorneys, was absent, so Alan, who was actually on the jury, came to help Grant, and ended up winning the case for us. It was pretty weird, because Alan did all the talking, and planned the whole case in about twenty minutes, while Grant sat. Interview went pretty okay. I got crossed examined by Kat, who asked idiotic questions. At the end, we found out that all of the jury had voted against us, except for one person, who convinced all of them that we should have won, and so we did. Friday:- Made a sad attempt to practice with the quartet, which ended up being a duet, because, as I said, Jane left her music at school, and Jessica went out to dinner. So Ro and I just messed around. She ended up spewing food three times (I counted) from laughing so hard. Bleah. She does that at least once every time she comes over. We have resolved to go to the Smoothie and Expresso place. Good stuff.
