It was a great weekend, and it was just like old times again. Friday consisted of just hanging out at his apartment. Saturday was packed full with fun stuff, including going to O'Shay's Pub. Its a nice little pub that attracted "the older" crowd of college students... basically over 21. Yay, no drunk 18 year olds hanging around. We then returned to the apt and went to the pool. I had to leave the next day *frowns*, but it was overall a very nice trip and it was great to see him again.   2)  Danny  called me up and told me he was going to be performing at  Mellow Mushroom  on Monday night, so I went out there to support him. While I was there, I ended up bumping into a high school friend that I had not seen since High School.  Davis Chappell  and I were in the advanced academic program together for years. We hung out all night, and I then went directly to class. It was great to see him, and I'm glad to see he's doing well. We reminisced about the old days and were thankful they were over. The crazy thing... he lives next door to Gary in Athens... its a small world. It was truly awesome to see him!   3) VSU never ceases to amaze me.... My Summer Session II class " Intro to the EU/ POLS 4830 " via WebCT actually was a session I class. Thanks VSU for the notification! (SARCASM) The class is hosted out of Augusta State Univ. I caught the error while hanging out w/ another student from my Global Security class.. we took it imediately to the dept. head and of course, he was amazed at what was going on... he definately helped us out though, however we are still having problems w/ getting things sorted out. There are 5 of us from VSU involved.   I know that doesn't seem like much, but add to that 6 hours mayterm plus one 3 hr directed study... yikes!  So basically, I'm taking 12 hrs Mayterm.         Happy Birthay Irene!
