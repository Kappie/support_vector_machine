(so people say looking into your pupils while tripping makes you insane? well well well..lemme try! ok, that is off the point..let me..find..it.aha!)i tried incantations of this ancient book the dead, the book of satan.:( i would only usewhatever ingredients i could get myhands on1/4-1/2 of what was required. i attemped to summon some ancient thing. i dont know what the hell i was thinking. but if memory serves me correctly, it was shortly after my dabblings in this occult that i got out of school suspension, became a pill fiend, and then wound up in rehab. it's haunting me..it's haunting me... now as i continue to dig up my past, i recall ordering a book on shamanism over the net. the dude accidently sent me a calendar on magic before he sent me the book.he told me to keep it. thinking it was harmless enough, i kept it up all school year long. i really liked the pictures. soon, i cut them out and hung them on my closet. SO is it just coinsidence that this year was the WORST YEAR OF MY ENTIRE LIFE or was it that-by opening my psyche to magical concepts-even if white-wiccan-it also openedME up to tons of bad stuff, too. :(..spirits eagerly waiting on the otherside, in the netherworld, to prance on anyone willing, waiting. so nowi am left to wonder if it is the tormented soul of charles roberts haunting the fenstemakers. it could easily be. i guess it could easily be any demon, tho, too. when tonya was living there, she would ask me to join her cult. id always say no, that i wasnt into drinking blood and shit. at the time, i think she wanted it to be white magic, which i was also into at the time. but she got more than she bargained for-im sure-it turned into black magic. i never wanted to drink blood. i always refused to and always NIEVELY shrugged it off when matt/dave/andrew t old me that was the 411.i secretly hoped it reaLLy wasnt happening. and now? now, i will never know what really happened. all i know is that ihave this overwhelming feeling that i must help them. that i cant let them flounder alone, with tempation all around them. perhaps that house iS the gateway into hell. perhapsi lost my soul a long time ago and now im doing my best to reclaim it.
