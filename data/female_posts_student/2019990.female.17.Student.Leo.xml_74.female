You know, I've noticed I get distracted easily lately. I wonder why that is. Oh look a butterfly!    So after my minor freak out due to lack of human contact, I got relief. Giles invited me to go with him the next morning (thursday hey that was yesterday morning) to an auction being held on acount of Crazy Dayz. Now I had never been to an auction, so I'm like ok, if it gets me out of the house. We met at the used book store, very fun place. Then headed down to the auction. it was pretty interesting. Giles and I joked about the merchandise and the purchasers. I saw about $20 worth of cigarettes smoked. Don't you love the smell of lung cancer in the morning? I know I do. And I really like it when I see the EMT's chain smoke. It makes me feel real safe. I mean what do you do when your EMT has a heart attack while trying to save your life? I didn't bid on anything. Ooh speaking of bidding I need to check my ebay stuff. Ok I checked it. But there was this lady sitting in front of me, who kept bidding, and the auctioneer would look at her, but very much in my direction and say amounts of money, and I'm like no no I don't have any money. Giles bid a couple of times though. Oh you better believe it was intense. And he won a tool box. Wee. I was then happy, because I had had my human contact, and could face the rest of the day until Wonder Woman returned.   When she got home she decided since she didn't have to work friday (that's today) we should do something fun. So we went to Great Spoons and shopped at target for a while after going to the Urb, and then we went to see King Arthur. Now some one (that may have been me) forgot that even though it's hot outside it's not necesarrily hot in the movie theatre. So even leaving Target I was really cold, and I sat throught the whole movie (2hours and 10mins) curled in a ball in my chair shivering. A t-shirt and shorts are not adequate for a movie theatre. This wouldn't have been so bad, except tat the movie got the story all wrong! (We went to King Arthur by the way) The only similarities I saw between the story I know and the movie were that Arthur and Guienevier fall in love, and it was set in Britain. In my opinion, don't waste your money, and read the once and future King instead.
