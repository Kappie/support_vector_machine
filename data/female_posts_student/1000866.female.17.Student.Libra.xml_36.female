My two index fingers. I type pretty darn fast for that though. Lalalalalalala. Seriously, it is good to laugh a lot. Typing constantly is sort of keeping my mind off of truly thinking of the audition, and considering it all.   Hmmm. I'm talking with Brett, and Matthew. It's fun. I enjoy talking to both of them. I'm trying not to bring up the A audition though...   You know, I think I'd rather be known as prude and not be able to get guys, then a slut who can get guys. If I'm going to get herpes, I want to get it from someone I'm going to spend the rest of my life with.    Haha, sorry. I was just having a conversation about that with someone.  And I'm gone again...
