I don’t think those feelings will ever fade,  You were born a part of me. I was never good at hiding anything, My thoughts break me, Do you understand what you mean to me, You are my faith.  Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. Don’t take her smile away from me, She’s broken and I’m far away. Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. If you made the world a stage for me, Then I hope that you can hear me scream. Won’t you cure my tragedy?  When I sit and think of the days we shared, And the nights you covered for me. Every little thing that I ever did, You would stand by me. Every time you cried it would take my wind, My heart would break. If I could be strong like you were for me, You are my faith.  Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. Don’t take her smile away from me, She’s broken and I’m far away. If you made the world a stage for me, Then I hope that you can hear me scream.  Can you hear me scream?  Can you hear me scream?  Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. Don’t take her smile away from me, She’s broken and I’m far away. Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. If you made the world a stage for me, Then I hope that you can hear me scream.  I can’t take this anymore, I can’t feel this anymore. Won't you take and give her pain to me,  Cause my whole life I made mistakes.  Can you hear me scream?  Can you hear me scream?
