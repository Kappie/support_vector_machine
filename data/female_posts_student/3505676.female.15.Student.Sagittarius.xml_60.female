It was great seeing some of my team mates again, like lauren, nikki, emily, erin, etc.  There were a TON of freshman.  7 of them and 2 more are coming.  So we're def. gonna hafta make cuts this year, unlike last year.  Most of them are just now starting volleyball, but i mean tahts fine, i practically did the same thing.  Overal theyre pretty shy, but one girl is like really cocky and i dno why but w/e.  It just felt great not to be the youngest one.  Actually, it felt wonderful *lol* but i'm gonna try to make them feel welcome...i know they must be nervous w/ so many of them trying out.  Tennis got rained out so a few of them came down and watched volleyball for a while [i love my tennis girls!] then matt, andrew, and jeff came by.  We hung out for a while and then went to bojangle's before heading back to halifax for the boys' soccer tryouts.  Everyone started to show up for that [[met 2 new kids]] Hung out til the guys hadta go play then dropped of maggie and me and jen went back to her house, showered, and hung out til maggie came back and we had our girl party --that was a great pillow fight maggie! Maggie drove me home later than night and now its tuesday, another day closer to when school starts, and another day of volleyball.
