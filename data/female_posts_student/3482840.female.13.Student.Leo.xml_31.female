So I'm gonna call Grams and see if she'll take me somewhere. I dunno where but, we'll see. If Grams was like Carolann's nana ((scary...)), I wouldn't love her so much.    And Mr. Kuchta's family history project was so cool, since I interviewed Grams. I had no idea that she married my Grandpa TWICE, once in Italy and once in the US, or that she was a lunch lady at OUR SCHOOL years and years before her oldest son was a twinkle in Grandpa's eye. It was so awesome that she even remembered! After her 3 strokes and loss of memories, we had to teach her how to tie her shoes again! But she could remember stuff from farther back than I ever cared to think about.    She even told me about how my Grandpa worked at Carling's Black Label Brewery, but he never drank alcochol at all. And she told me how they got arrested on thier honeymoon because they weren't sure if Grams was really a US citizen. Grams is SO cool. Oh, and she's an AWESOME cook!
