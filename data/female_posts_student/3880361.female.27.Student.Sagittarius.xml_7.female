At first, it seemed to me that none of us thought about an overnite in Tokyo, well, I guess somehow, nite life in  urlLink ROPPONGI  is really new and tempting that we can't resist exploring,okay, everyone, let's take the plunge...  Intended to see SPIDER MAN 2 on the first show day in ROPPONGI's virgin cinema,we came to find that the 5.45 pm show of  urlLink of the film  was sold out and decided to try  urlLink THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW . My only complaint was that we had to be seated on the front and to me the film sometimes has unnecessary emotional-raising scenes. And the idea of seeing the SPIDER MAN 2 was kinda persistent that we tried the 27:10 show. An overnite was also wise in the sense that until the end of the show do train operated and we wanted to go another clubbing. All of us, The Monk seemed to be the most advocating to the ideas of overnite, Lady Van and me may share an equal same enthusiasim to make it, the 183 boy was also curiuos about his first visit to ROPPONGI and Lady Phuong and Lady Thu is too nice to be with us. If only one of us wanted to left early, the overnite would collapse, I guess.   Is there anything I miss out in this messy post? ah, I tried the  urlLink Tequila Sunrise  while other orders were common stuff like  urlLink Sex on the beach ,  urlLink Margarita    The clubs are only Japanese in the sense that they are funnily small as a club and somtimes we couldn't find room to swing our hips... hehehe.   surpise,surprise, we all felt it when we got out of the comfortable cinema, it had been sunny and bright ... Someone regreted getting up so late and made a resolution to make an earlier day.   got home at 7 and slept like a log after coming home till noon... still tired and the legs hurt..   well, sleepness in Tokyo...
