And i don't follow him and stuff, we're mates, but its harder for me as he now has Laura. I couldn't sleep for imagining what they will do, the walks, talks, hugs etc. Sleeping with each other, him calling her his baby, things he would have said to me, he'll say to her, becase i just know he will. Eliots right about him being a cheater, and a player, but it will be easier for them to make it work as he is at her college, i would hate to see them have a long time relationship, as hard as that is and mean, i will hate it, i want him back.   ~Lisa~
