I can hardly play her pieces, but thank heavens, I managed to play the three pieces SHE was supposed to play. I made some mistakes, but it's not my fault! She's the one who took the lessons, not me! I learn the flute, not piano.  I got slightly carsick-I mean trainsick. Hey, it's all the way from Yew Tee to Bugis! The whole journey's about 45 mins, and wasting all that time on a dumb train is not worth!  I have to go really soon now, but I'll do some plugging first. To whoever is reading this now, if you have time, pop over to www.fictionpress.com/~Rowenisvanya and read our works. We, as in Eve and I, ok?? Please review too!   Okay, I'm done with all that shameless plugging. Haizz... have to concentrate on my homework now... HAIZZZZZZ!!!!
