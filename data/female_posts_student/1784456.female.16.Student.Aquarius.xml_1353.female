Well, I think some people got it wrong, they were walking into school when I walked out (at the end of school, not an actual protest thingy) Hmm... Yeah! WALK IN! Woohoo! (I some how don't think that it's gonna catch on guys!) Mmm... Also we're gonna protest in the middle of our school during school time! YEAHHH! (Look out for me, future world wide human rights activist) Yeah right, probably in some crummy factory job or some thing... any way! Aaargh! I'm getting really annoyed by people who 'don't care' about the war, or think that 'nothing we can do can change the situation'. Yeah. Tried that already in France. Remeber Le Pen? He would have become the next racist leader if the people had not come out in force and stopped him (the fact that their current president is actually corrupt doesn't really matter...) Mmm... Well. I'm changing what I want to change. I'm not eating any chocolate, apart from fair trade chocolate. Mad? Nope. I just believe in ethics, and I want to feel good in my heart as well as my stoumach, don't worry, I'll still eat as much! (When this damn lent thing is over!) It's good to do lent though, it makes you think about things. (Don't ask how, haven't got there yet) Hey I better go. Adios.
