Ya1: probably the only person i ever accosted on my own will cuz i felt like i already knew her and just knew that she'd be my friend. it really paid off. we always say that if only we could meet a guy whom we feel the same way about the way we do each other (plus romantic feelings), we'll have found our soulmates. we laugh, cry, share, exchange, and grow together. she drives me crazy with her stubborness, but every day, i find myself having even more respect for her views, integrity, and values. i never cease to be amazed at how much she understands me, and how much of what she says is exactly what i'm thinking and feeling. her place in my life really reaffirms my belief in fate.  Ya2: genuinely the most caring person i have ever met. also one of the funniest. and skinniest. probably the only person in the world that i feel like i can talk to forever, and i mean hours without end. everyone who has ever met her says that she is the nicest person to have walked the face of the earth, but i'm still touched over and over again by how especially caring, giving, and understanding she is to me.  if ever i needed someone to care about my welfare as much as i do, i'd know where to go.
