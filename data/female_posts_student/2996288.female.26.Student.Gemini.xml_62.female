Knowing that one particular friend would read the list, I included the task: "Get a Date" just to be funny.  Then there was a party Saturday night, and I decided to at least  try  to check that one off.  (Me trying is generally not that effective)  Anyway, I turned my full flirty force on two different lucky guys from our class.  Totally harmless, and a lot of fun, really...    So, today we started new rotations - I'm in neuro, on the stroke service for two weeks, then on general neuro.  (by the way, for anyone keeping track, 2 of the 3 people who hate me have completely DISAPPEARED.  I SWEAR I had nothing to do with it!!!)  The two aforementioned boys (men?  am I that old yet?) are on a different team - together.  They were on rounds this afternoon, and came to the floor I'm on.  I was then faced with a dilemma which I have never experienced before: how to flirt with two guys at once.  Or really, since we were technically at work, and full-force flirting is not really highly encouraged, how to not let either of them think that I was paying more attention to the other.  It was quite a sticky situation.  I felt like Marcia Brady.  With curly hair and glasses.  You know what I discovered, though?  It's kinda fun!  I think I should just keep up the flirting, and never actually check that task off the list...  I'm going on a cruise!  Today begins the "Cruise Body Quest"  That should include going to the Y to work out, but...I don't  wanna!!   I'm tired, I slept horribly last night, I need to be in by 6:30 tomorrow, and it is already past my 6pm rule.  (Home by 6? Y by 7)  So...I'll stick with the less food leg of CBQ, and hopefully I'll have time for the gym leg tomorrow.  Is there another leg?  I haven't seen FNI in many, many days.  Otherwise, I could potentially have 3 males to balance.  Oh what a topsy-turvy world!
