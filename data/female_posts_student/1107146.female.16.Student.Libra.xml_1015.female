Enjoy my gift of skin-tight chainmail (so as to prevent those pesky spider bites (and when I read that, I was like, "what the hell is this")) and a cure-all panacea (for those pesky and recurrent bouts of mono (which also yielded a comment, albeit a stronger one)) coming in your mail in a few days, you deserve it.  Because it's all BS. God, I can't tell you how outraged I feel at life being stupid to ye.
