Seriously.   First of all, this happens at school all the time.  I don't know how many times I will say hello to someone, a someone who I may or may not have met, only to have them either (1) look at me as if I were insane or (2) fail to recognize that anyone has said hello to them, or stands before them, at all.  This is especially true of people I have met before, who, in typical New York fashion, pretend like they have never seen you before the next time they see you, even if you had a fairly lengthy and engrossing conversation.    This certainly does nothing to help the level of my frustration.  But these are not the things that bother me the most, or make me feel the most invisible.  For while these people are most certainly being rude, they are perhaps forgivable.  I mean, it is possible that they are just in a hurry, and rather than having to stop to say "hi" and explain that they are in a hurry, they'd rather just ignore.  This is understandable, even if it isn't the best way to deal with the situation.    No, the ones that get me the most are the complete strangers, the people on the street.  Just today, for example, two different sets of people came and stood directly in front of me at the bus stop, in the middle of and completely disregarding the line, as if I were not there are all.  I wanted to shout at them "Look people, there is a line here, and believe it or not, I AM STANDING IN IT!"  But in my typical passive-aggressive style, I just stepped to the side and sighed.    Anyway, I hope this happens to other people.  Not that I'd wish ill on others, but at least it would mean that I am not, indeed, invisible.
