So all I need to say is a big thankyou to Ella and Anna for being nice, and looking out for me.  2nd: Web Authoring. I was lonely. I'm always lonely these days. I don't know if it was even worth choosing that subject - but I wouldn't be any better off in Nationalism: firstly because I wouldn't enjoy it, and secondly because Ella and Ad√®le and Ingrid etc. are better friends with each other than they are with me ... and then there's the whole thing about Rebecca, who hasn't spoken to me in ages.  3rd: French. I love French. It's one of my favourite subjects (I know - it's pretty pathetic). But today in French we were presenting our orals, and my CD wouldn't work. I put  so  much effort into it, and I was actually looking forward to presenting it. Off to a bad start already.  4th: Recess. Nothing bad really happened at recess, but nothing good happened either. Actually, one bad thing happened: I realised I had double English next. (No offense Ms Roberts).  5th: Double English. Firstly - she made me read a part in Romeo  Juliet, which was bad. And when I got to go to the library to find a book for wide reading and came back with 8 - I don't think she was extremely impressed. And then Julia, Emily, Bob  Pip were having reading competitions with me, and Julia asked Ms Roberts to d one, and she wasn't too impressed by the idea ... too scared that I would beat her, perhaps? (Or maybe she just wanted to express her hatred towards me by showing that she won't voluntarily participate in activities involving me ... but then  WHY  am I in her camp group? - This is what I find impossible to understand!!!).  6th: Maths. We got our probability tests back. Naturally I made 2 stupid mistakes, and I lost a mark on one thing I misunderstood - yet  4  marks were missing. What had I done wrong??? That was the question I asked Mrs Kettle. Well, apparantly I lost a mark because I filled out the table with percentages instead of decimals. Why was this wrong, I asked. Because there was a one in the corner, meaning they should all add up to one. But technically, don't percentages add up to one, too - 100% = 1 in percentages language. Plus - I was never taught that they had to be decimals, and it didn't say that they had to be decimals in the question! Well, I fought long and proud, but I couldn't convince her to give me my mark back. And then I worked out my grade: if she hadn't taken off the mark, then I would have got an A+ ... but I'm stuck with an A, because my teacher hates me. Then I left the classroom feeling extremely upset, and spoke to Ella, who said in her class (the top group, which is where I am meant to be, but technically I'm not smart enough for...) were given the mark even if they did percentages, because Mr Gowdy thought that was correct. That's discrimination!!! Just because I'm in the 2nd group, Mrs Kettle thinks she can treat me like dumb shit!!!  7th: Abba. Actually, Abba was okay. Just a shout out to Mrs Mason to say thanks for being so nice - she's such a great person - was very kind to me in my strange hysteria (the effects of a certain maths teacher on my brain. Happens often after maths tests). So, thank-you Mrs Mason, and sorry I'm such a crap student. My next texts assignment is due tomorrow, and I promise it will be in on time!!!  8th: People and Politics. Well, Mr K forgot to come - so the first 1/2 hour of the lesson was fine - I was talking to Emma and Zoe. But then when he turned up, finally, after Elise and Margeaux had to go fetch him, he decided to start a discussion on the free trade agreement - which doesn't actually concern us, because none of us are old enough to vote - and if we cared then we'd read about it in the newspaper. And the he told us about our first assignment - a research paper on a  HERO . Yeah, well, who is my hero??? Harriet Walker - well she's a fictional character, can't do her!!! Melinda, Chrissy or even Jo (from  Small Claims ) - all fictional!!! Then there's Freya, but she's an actress ... and people would probably make fun of me. But she is a great role model. I don't know!!!  9th: P.E. I had a *note* to excuse myself from participating, so I got to watch the class learn some footy skills. Football's too dangerous for me. I was almost killed about 3 times by stray balls, and all I was doing was sitting behind the table. Mr Oneill's so used to it now. He even said to me, "Are you too tired from avoiding playing soccer yesterday?" (yeah - I had almst perfect sports uniform yesterday - everything except I wore my school jumper).  10th: Fazz. Well - I turned up at the bus stop, just after 1/4 to 4 - the agreed time, and he wasn't there. So I sorta hung around, but I felt a bit weird seeing as I don't even catch the bus, until Vinnie told me Fazz wasn't even at school today. So I felt really shit ... I was looking forward to seeing him all day, it was raining, and I needed a hug.  11th: Gloria Jeans. There was a tram coming that was heading into Camberwell, so I decided to see if I could catch Ella, Lizz and Annaliese at Gloria Jeans, because I didn't feel like going home, and they left school just after me, so I knew I could catch them. They reached the tram stop at about the same time I did, coincidentally. So I joined them. I didn't think Ella and Lizz would mind. But Annaliese did. She really didn't seem happy with my desperate need for support, and my tagging along to avoid being alone.  12th: At the station. It wasn't so bad, until we got to the station and Ella left. I started crying, because she was gone, and Annaliese and Lizz were talking. I tried to include myself in the conversation, and Lizz helped, but Annaliese seemed unwilling. I don't know what I ever did to her - I like Annaliese, but she really doesn't seem to like me ... (sighs).  So anyway, there's not much I can do at the moment, except find my phone, and hope that by some miracle Fazz has messaged me. And I'm gonna call Ella - her counselling skills are required immediately.  Oh yeah - we didn't end up having the French vocab quiz (thankfully) !!!
