My exams are days away and here I am getting all excited over my third month pressie for my baby! I just don’t believe myself! What happened to my old self? I honestly think that she just got up one day and went for a really long walk and never quite came back…  My books are untouched and nothing seems to matter... I've been feeling so lethargic and I simply can't wait for the holidays. Do I even deserve to have holidays? I haven't even worked hard enough to earn days off. This really isn't me...   LOST : Hardworking, nerdy chick who responds to the name Junie. She'd rather stay at home than party all night. She's only lazy when it comes to getting all dressed up and partying night after night. Other than that, she'll keep her house relly clean and bug her boyfriend to do the same. She was last seen walking languidly around Chapel Street. Please inform me if you do see her... I'm desperate! I'll even offer a reward for this chick!!  ** 1-2 kissies for my man
