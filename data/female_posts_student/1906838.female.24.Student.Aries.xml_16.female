Today I have been timetabled for postnatal wards but i had to attend the morning ward rounds in NICU as well. As far as first impressions go .. the doctors in NICU are NICE. Again when i say nice, i mean they dont actually give u a hard time and even if ure stuck and cannot answer their questions, they dont give any nasty remarks which would leave you feeling smaller than the babies in NICU itself. So yeah .. ive decided that the doctors im gonna work with this week are nice.. so shouldnt be too bad a week afterall.. The babies in NICU are all, as would be expected tiny and most are prems, needing lots of support and attention. Some of them have been in the ward for months .. and it occured to me .. goodness.. sian the mom cos she wont be able to have much time to bond with her baby just yet .. well.. i suppose she would have some time when she goes to visit the baby or to feed him.. but its not like you have the baby with you AT HOME. ...hmm.. i just realised that the SHO in postnatal is off to a clinic this afternoon so i think i should make good use of my time to get that green infant admission sheet done.Argh .. i have to try and make good use of my time so i dont panic at the last minute. Im still indignant by the fact that the only acute on call i have during ward 29 next week is the night before the final submission of all written work. What the f**K???!!! I think, seriously, whoever created these timetables mustve forgotten that we medical students are still human beings afterall.. there isnt even such a thing as a super-doc.. so would u expect there to be a super-medical student??????!!!  Yesterday i went home feeling a bit down, especially since it was 6pm by the time i reached the flat and golliwog hadnt called me. I wasnt really expecting him to call yesterday because we had already talked for quite a long time on sunday. however , he did call at midnight.. and told me some very interesting news!!! goodness me .. just thinking about it makes me feel like i cant wait to get this exams done and over with!!!hahaha..    oh .. and the mysterious prank call occured again last night at about the same time. ah . malas ku mikir hal tok doloks ehs..  i told golliwog about this and he thinks it just MIGHT be that person .. but then like me, he thought that person wouldve actually said something instead of just keeping quiet. i dont know i dont give a damn. zak thinks it could also be some random prank caller cos she's had some experience of THAT before.. well.. methinks the next time i actually think its my prankcaller and not my mom/golliwog .. i wouldnt bother being polite ...
