OK, so it sounds cruel to laugh at him but it was so funny!  I let that kid organize something for once (for our sunday school group) and he told me Sunday that he would tell me the time after his baseball practice Sunday night. SO, On Monday when I heard about Lindsey's mom and that she need Josh's number I called his house and his mom picked up and said that he would get back later.....so I figured that he was either out with Jill or more likely at Baseball practice for the upteenth time. SO I call him Tuesday to tell him that Linds's mom is ok and that he better call me or A.I'm going to think he's dead or B. He just accidently forgot that he's supposed to be planning this get together...either way he's already in trouble. I'm not patient...well not alot and it didn't help that I had Jessica going in the other ear "When are we meeting, Where, What day, What time again?" it sucked. Anyway I finally got to him today and it turns out the kid has been in bed sick...it was just too funny... he was to plan something for the first time and he gets sick...of course I was the friend that laughed but wished him to get well soon....AND he's got to get well to go to our summer camp Undone (with our church)(I'll be in on of the 8 colleges I chose to see) and CentreKid to be a helper....he's gotta get well FAST...so he basicalliy chose the worst week to be sick and it was FUNNY.  Ok so I'm a little mean. :-P  Rosie
