He was listening to music loudly online, and was reading what I think was a sports article... but I am unsure.  Then he began to breath very heavily.  I was nervous, and kept my eyes trained on the screen in front of me and focused on email.  There was this heavy breathing, and then a kind of wheezing cough that was still breathing, and he began to role back and forth in the chair, getting increasingly loud and moving more and more.  Eventually he stood up, mumbling and still breathing hard.  Then he sat down, and then stood back up.  He was a large man, and I couldn't look directly at him because is energy made me afraid and I was attempting to blur him out of my reality.  Up and down, up and down.  Part of me wanted to ask, "are you okay?  Are you having a seizure?" he looked like he was quacking a bit.  But instead, I was just slightly confused and a little intimidated by his oddness.  He wasn't fitting with what is, and I knew it, and he likely knew it too.  Maybe he even knew that I knew.  No one else seemed to be troubled as I dashed my eyes back and forth around the lab.  No one was noticing- but maybe they were just being covert about it like me.  I sent off the four lines of email I had managed to get off, and then I closed the window and tried to look casual as I found another computer that was blocked from view by a square column.  Do these thing happen to everyone?
