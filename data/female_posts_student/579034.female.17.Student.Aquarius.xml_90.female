Then I went to Barns and Noble and bought "Rudy" and a book I needed for school and another book I found that looked pretty interesting. I read most of it in the store but my mom called and told me she was picking me up so I bought it, too. I dunno, today was one of those I-really-miss-Mickey-days. I just thought about him all day and I dunno it kinda made my mood worse. Kinda I just miss him a whole not. But, February isn't too far away, that is if he comes in February, and if he does, APril isn't far away from that. And, even if he doesn't, April isn't too far away from now. Right? Course. I'm watchin "Rudy" right now. This movie just totally hits me right here ::points to heart:: man, ya know? I really wanna go there. I totally know how Rudy feels. It's funny cause parents are supposed to bring you up and stuff and all my mom does really is tell me that I really should look into other places besides ND, and when I told her I was thinkin of St. Mary's she just kinds laughs like it's not a big deal or I really won't go away or something. I really don't think she gets that I'm going. No one really gets it. Like... I don't think any one thinks I'm really gonna go. The movie is at the part when Rudy is gettin ready to go to Notre Dame, right after Pete dies. I'm in one of those moods where I wanna do the same. Just jump on a bus, head to Indiana. Live in Mickey's upstairs (lol). I think, if I had to make my own perfect little world, there would be lots of like... space. Lots of green. Rolling hills, a lake, a pool, a nice house. And all my friends would be my neighbors. We would have our own little neighborhood. Raise our kids together. They would all be friends. Just live in our own little worlds where like... I dunno... things made sense... didn't always change, and when change did happen it was slow and easy to adapt to. None of these bad things like, heart ache, and pain, and saddness, missing someone so much that it kills. Heh, I kinda sound like Holden Cawfeild (sp?) don't I? Eh I really don't know what I'm sayin any more, just kinda babbling aren't I? Aw man, Rudy just walked onto the football feild. God I miss that place. I wish I could stand on that feild. I mean sitting in the bleachers was awesome, imagine STANDING actaully STANDING on the feild? Okay, I think I've rambled enough. Much Love x0x
