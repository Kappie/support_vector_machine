       
      Across The Miles I feel your gentle touch though you are far away I feel the warmth inside of me by your side I long to stay.  Across the miles I see your smile and feel your tender kiss. If only you were here with me I wouldn't feel as lonely as this.  But the distance is all worth and will pay off one day For we will share a love so true that will forever stay.  So as you lie awake underneath these same bright stars Know in your heart I long to be Right there where you are.  Across the miles I still smile  Even though you are far from me  Because I know that soon enough  in your arms I'll be.   ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
