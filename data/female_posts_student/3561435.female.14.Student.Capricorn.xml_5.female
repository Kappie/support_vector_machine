I honestly don't care who reads this as long as it's not actually people who I know and/or talk about in here. I don't know why you would want to read this but some people get a weird thrill digging into other people's personal thoughts. I certainly wouldn't want to deprive you of that! WARNING: Ok, here's my disclaimer: My life may not be the most interesting thing you've ever read about but hopefully it won't get too confusing. I'll try to explain everything very thouroly, if I can. Oh, and by the way, I'm also not the best speller. Now if you still want to read all my personal thoughts, I'll keep talking.  Ok, most people want to know about me before they actually see what happens to me everyday. So for starters, I'm 5' 7", Brunette, Brown eyes, not fat and not extremely skinny. I usually wear jeans and a short-sleaved shirt. See, I mis-spelled ...AGAIN! Anyways, where was I, Oh, I live in Kansas, the FLAT state! Yeah, my parents haven't exactly evolved into the computer age yet. I'm down here for an hour to do all my homework. So, I gotta go at 4:30 and I want to do other things, so I'll talk to everyone later! My suggestion of the day: when you go to the bathroom in a public place, stick your hand under the stall door of your neighbor and ask them for a highlighter! K, BYE!
