I thought to myself...gee Traci...of course you can say yes... YOU HAVE NO LIFE !   So there is more trouble on the horizon. I thought I was clean out of my previous apartment, but it turns out that they are holding me responsible for about a thousand dollars. They told me not to worry about the lump sum, ans that I can pay it off in payments. Boy, did that make me feel better.   I owe mom lots of monet for bills.   It makes me very sad to be away from  urlLink Brenden  as much as I am. I shared my feelings with him. The only solution that we can come up with is the realization that we are very differnent in the way we feel about being apart. I have a feeling I wouldn't be so bad if I had mobility and other things to do. Theatre...I need some theatre dammit.
