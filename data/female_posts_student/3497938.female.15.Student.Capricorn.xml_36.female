Yeah, I care about him... but whatever happens, happens and its for a reason. Me and Chelsea are officially obsessed with The Awkward Romance. Yeah, we love them... alot.I am in a happy, yet tired mood. I wonder how that works... Tomorrow I start driving school. Its only for a week, so I hope it wont be too bad. Maaaaybe i'll meet this really hot guy there, and i'll fall madly in love with him and spend every moment with him. Or maybe not...
