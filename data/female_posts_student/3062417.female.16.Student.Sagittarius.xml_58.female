It's just gotten to the point where I don't care anymore. I have done some stupid things lately that I can't talk to anyone about because they will probally make me see a therapist and put me on drugs which I don't want to happen. I want to be happy without drugs making me that way. It might be hard but I think I can do it and I will be stronger once I get through this.  I'm such a troubled person. I wish I just had someone to talk to. Maybe then I wouldn't take things out on myself and mess my mind and my body up so badly. I try so hard to smile and be happy for people and by the end of the day all I want to do is cry myself to sleep. It's seriously the hardest thing ever to smile when I'm crying inside and all I want is to scream.  What am I supposed to do? Just give up on life? Go through the days like a mindless zombie and pretend to be the happiest person ever?   I'm so sick of all this shit, I just want to to all disappear and have my happy life back where I didn't have a worry in the world.
