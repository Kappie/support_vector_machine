Then, we went to DQ and ate ice cream in Kel's trunk. Haha. It was fun. People looked at us like we were so strange. So then, Kelly started driving us home but we were like, well...we don't really wanna go home, so...we went to Kel's house and just hung out for a while. Good fun. Then, Tom called and so we went with him and Stephen to Caribou. Yum. Hot chocolate with cookie crumbles. YUM! So, we just sat in Caribou for three hours talking and just...having a good time. I hadn't had the chance to get to know Stephen and Tom that well until tonight. Fun fun times. I hope we get a chance to do that again. I'm going to miss kath and kel and MC though over the next week. :(
