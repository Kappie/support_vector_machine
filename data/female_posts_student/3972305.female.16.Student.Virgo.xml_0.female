I left with my parents around 7:30 to go to pennsylvania. We got there at like 9:30 after a long drive in the rain. Work up early Thursday morning to go visit muhlenberg. I liked the school a lot just wish it was a little bigger, but it was still really nice. I left a tape for the basketball coach, I hope he gets back to me. We then left and traveled another 2 hours to Franklin and Marshall. I loved the campus. When i was walking around i just felt like i belonged. i guess there really is that one right school for everyone. I just hope that id get to play basketball there. if so thats where i want to go. i also got to meet one of the chemistry professors. he was a really cool guy and really liked the research he was doing which made me even more excited about the school. he also liked basketball so maybe he'd be a little easier on my when i had games. we then got on the road again and traveled to gettysburg. On friday morningi had a tour of the school. i liked the school a lot. it was bigger than the others which was nice but you have to take 4 years of a foreign language and that definitly would suck. its not like a french major has to take 4 years of science so its really stupid so that was kind of a turn-off. we then took atour of the battlegrounds. i never knew how huge it was. it was really interesting. i didn't get to see any ghosts though.That would be the best part of the school. all the history of the area makes it more interesting. Then saturday morning we left to go to my basketball tournament. i got so beat up. the first game i poped out my shoulder, jammed my thumb, and hurt my knee. then the second game i got elbowed in the nose. we lost both games that day. then sunday i rolled my ankle and ran into a bleacher and bruised my arm all up. we lost the 2 games that day too so the tournament really sucked...oh well...i finally got to come home though and it was so nice to finally sleep in my own bed.
