Could that person who I knew in high school, the hateful jerk, can he change into a well rounded caring individual? In my own life I know that I’ve behaved in ways that I am not proud of, and I’ve seen myself change, but have I really? I’m still the same person; I still have the same blood running through my body, the same weaknesses, still prone to the same tendencies. Is changing something that is bigger than feeling sorry for an action and molding your behavior around that feeling? If I’d even been caught stealing, perhaps I wouldn’t do it again, but am I only changing because I got caught? I had a friend like this, who cried when she got caught, but was she crying only for herself or was she truly sorry for her actions? Can someone hit rock bottom, as my mom says, and finally realize that they have to change? How far down is the bottom and do you even have the resources to change when you get there? In particular, I’m scared for a person who I care very much about. I tried fixing him; however it only made me miserable with him. I’m hopeful he can change. I pray he changes, not for me, but so he can finally be happy without conjuring some silly moment from the past. I guess I am a hopeless optimistic, it’s finally hit me! When did I become this way? Last I remember I was a die hard pessimist, then all of a sudden, BAM! Obviously I’ve changed, so there MUST be hope for the rest of the world! :)
