Actually, I'ld rather not be a chiwawa, those things yap waay too much and they smell! (That is not me! Don't say any thing!) Mmm... very weird. This police siren kind of kept going half off then stopping. Maybe the SWAT team doesn't want me to know that they're here. :D Who want's to be serious? Their's a time a place for every thing and serious has to be saved for very special occasions! Trust me I should now. (Oooh, deep and meaningful aye?) Hehe, I love doing that. Saying things and getting every one to pick what they want out of it. Every one interperits things in different ways, like if I said: You've never been hurt like I've been hurt... Ok, so that could err be dodgey but I wouldn't say that! (You're in a hole and you're falling deeper fast) Eeek, I always dig myself into holes. Bit hyper cause I'm bored and it's total silence in my house cause it's only me here! Bubi!
