So, Kelly, Joanne, Mary Clare and me all go in Mary Clare's car, and Kathryn goes in hers. So, we all meet at Joanne's, and, I don't know...we were trying to decide who to follow downtown, but we all decided to go to the new parking garage since we didn't think there would be any parking in the old one. So, we start off, thinking Kathryn was following us, but then Kathryn cut us off, so we figured, "ok, I guess we're following her now." So, we follow her, but she goes to the old parking garage, and on the first level. We knew we wouldn't get a spot in there, so we go to the top level and find a spot. We walk down to the first level and look for Kathryn and we can't find her anywhere, so after a while, we call her sister at home and ask her to call Kathryn, because we don't know Kathryn's dad's phone, which is what she had. Sooooo, we tell her sister to tell Kath to meet us at Barnes  Noble, and so Kathryn finally does meet up with us...and she was SO mad. I have NEVER seen her so mad in my life. She actually yelled at us. I felt like I was being yelled at by my mother, and then Mary Clare says something, and I just saw it in Kathryn's eyes. I KNEW she'd leave, so she walks away, and Joanne and I follow her. I didn't really agree with her being so mad, but...I just didn't want this thing to be a big deal. I wanted her to stay and have a fun evening.So, we chased her and it was funny because she was walking super fast, and Joanne and I stopped and talked for a minute then ran after her, and then did that again. It was funny running after her because I felt like I was in some movie in slow motion like..."GEEETTT OOOOUUUUTTT OOFF THHEEEE WAYYYYY!!!!!!!" but anyway, finally she said she just needed ten minutes and she'd meet us back at B, and so, we start walking back, and Kelly and Mary Clare meet us halfway, and we start talking for a bit, and then go back to B, and heh, Kathryn was there already...so, not only could she not find us the first time, but also the second time we weren't where we said we would be. And the problem was, that was the attitude that lingered the whole night. Nobody in the group was too thrilled. We went to the riverwalk, and we got ice cream, and Kathryn apologized and all but still...it was just odd. Oh well, I guess I still had an ok time. Oh and, ok, i wore my pink hoodie because it's comfortable and stuff, and so I was walking down the street, and this guy in a group says, "she's cute, the one in pink" and I try to digest this because...heh, not many people say that, and so...I end up nearly walking into a pole, and THEN if that wasn't enough, I'm laughing so hard from walking into the pole, I walk into a SECOND pole! Wow. Joanne just couldn't stop laughing. Seriously, she's never going to let me live that up. She's going to tell my children that, and then....AHHHH!!!! Joanne, I'm going to hurt you!! Oh well...haha.  Then, today was a lot of fun. I went shopping and got new shoes, and and and...I went out to dinner and I saw Finding Nemo again. I saw Brandon there too!!! :) It was amazing, he was with his family and I with mine, and we all sat in the same row. It was funny stuff. Ah, and now...I think I'm just off to a relaxing evening by myself. I think I'll go read actually...
