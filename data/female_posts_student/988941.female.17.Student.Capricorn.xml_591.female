Without wanting to go into too much detail, just letting you know what I'e done today. Seems the Great British summer is over all ready, it's been overcast, raining and windy all day, but I can see just an ickle bit of blue sky over there now?!  Oh no, just disappeared beind that big 'orrible cloud again. Ah well, we'll have to see what tomorrow brings I guess. um.  Tomorrow I am working from 12.30 till 4.30 which will get me some extra dosh, then working the usual hours on Saturday. Then Sunday- I'm off to Austria!!!! Yahooooooooooooo! I'm trying to pack at the moment but I'm having a bit of a crisis cos I can't find my little black vest top anywhere! Where the hell is it? I've turned my room, my sisters' rooms a=nd the bathroom upside down, still no sign of it!  I can't go without it! Other than that, I think I'm decided on what CDs to take, what clothes to take, I definetly need a hair drier, Thais bites and dried fruit, then after that I will bung in as many more clothes that will possibly fit! he he. Clarinet is not going in suitcase this year, I will just shove it in the hold on the coach, seeings as last time I wasted precious suitcase space by trying to get it in! Was so devestated when I found out I could have left it out and taken more clothes! Anywho, that is about it. My top 5 CDs for the trip are going to be "Jagged Little Pill" by Alanis Morisette, "New Jersey" and "Cross Roads" by Bon Jovi, "Idol Hits" by Billy Idol and "Meatloaf and friends" by various artists (duh). Top beauty product: Nail file. Best holiday book: yet to find it! Ah that reminds me- got to go and get one!!!
