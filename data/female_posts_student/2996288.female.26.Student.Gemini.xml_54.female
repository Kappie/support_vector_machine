Not her preference, but since her inability to relax has proven almost fatal to too many past lovers, she's given up sex.  Fine. Except that her latest assignment has her going  undercover  with marketing hottie,  er , genius Rex Holt...field-testing risque sheet sets!  As if  that's  going to keep her mind off sex...especially when Rex is tempting enought to make her reconsider that little vow of celibacy.  Between the sexy bed linens and his even sexier assistant April, Rex's job has gotten  interesting .  He has sex on he brain.  Conducting  personal  trial runs on the sheets with April should clear his...mind.  Instead, Rex finds himself craving even more of her--he just has to convince her that what they have is more than a bit of fun and relaxation.  Good thing he can sell anything...including himself.   Thoughts: 1. When it says that her 'inability to relax has proven almost fatal,' do you think it actually means that this April Stevens has almost killed poor men during sex? 2. April Stevens is not a very exciting name for a 'romance' heroine.  (not like  Misty Fortune , the heroine of another book I found here called  Against the Odds ) 3. Rex Holt is a  perfect  name for a 'romance' hero. 4. Do you suppose they advertise for "risque sheet set tester" in the classifieds? 5. Does this actually qualify as a plot?  What could the climax be? 6. Could these words all be code for something actually resembling a story, or is this truly just a book where people just have sex? 7. Does the author of this book have her work on display at home? 8. What inspired the story? 9. How many publishers did the author have to send the book to until it got picked up? 10. Are trashy 'romance' novels of this caliber merely porn for women?  What about Danielle Steele?  Nora Roberts?  D.H. Lawrence?  Charlotte Bronte?  Where is the line between 'romance' and 'trash?'  Okay... enough thinking.  Time to leave here and see what it is like in the real world!
