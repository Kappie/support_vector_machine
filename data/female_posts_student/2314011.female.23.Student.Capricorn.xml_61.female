I usually brief (summarize) the assigned cases, read and highlight the notes following them and move on.  Today found me taking notes on the notes AND introductory material in front of cases.  My god!  In some instances those notes exceeded the initial brief.  Overall, I think the change is a good one; couldn't hurt at the very least.  Not sure how the 2 subjects (4 cases) in 5 hours will work during a usual week, but feel pretty confident about the new arrangement going in.    Soon I'll be headed home for some light cleaning (the floor needs a good vacuuming at the very least), and maybe some not-so-light Yoga before settling in with the Globies.  Not sure when the next book, Ghostwritten, will get its start, but the wait's worthwhile.  Trying to remedy my habit of beginning (and continuing) books in the moments before bedtime in favor of reserving nice, big blocks of quality time for them.  Kinda like one would if one had a lover.    In other important-in-a-completely-insignificant-way news, my feet seem to have adapted to my new shoes to the point where I can at last wear them without fear of wearing the skin away from the back of my foot, just above the heel.  YAY!
