First of all she lives in Henderson. That wouldn't be a big deal if I hadn't worked all day and if I weren't very tired. So anyway, we went to this kariokie bar that was so redneck and sucked really bad. Plus she was on the phone all night and wandering around the bar talking to everyone but me. I just wasn't having a good time at all. Then when I finally got someone to take her home so I could go I got stuck in this road construction that took me about thirty minutes out of my way. I was running low on gas and almost out of smokes. (Mandy and her brother didn't bring any squares to the bar and bummed off me all night) Anyway, I stopped at a gas station and only had enough money for gas. So now tomorrow I am going to be an even bigger bitch because I will be at work all day without anything and be running on very little sleep. Well I guess I need to get offline and go to bed. I just can't wait to start my day tomorrow. WOOHOO!!!
