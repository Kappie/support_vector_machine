Lots of  urlLink reviewers  are giving it mixed ratings, but that's okay.  It's a summer movie, so how much can we expect?  If it's any good, I'll tell you.    ******** Monday, July 12, 2004  Well, it was everything I expected it to be--which I guess wasn't much.  It mostly abandoned the traditional Arthurian plotlines.  One interesting battle scene, and another that went on far too long; not much blood or flesh; nice scenery; a total disregard for early British history.  Apparently Britain was never conquered by the Angles and Saxons, which means we should be speaking Welsh rather than English.  But at least I can take Old English off my exam reading list...  One interesting thing was that Arthur was a Christian--they showed him praying once or twice, and one plot twist depended on his feeling Christian mercy rather than self-interest.  Unusual.  But he was also a follower of Pelagius.  I'm not sure what to make of this plot twist--of course a Hollywood movie couldn't have a long discussion of theology, but it was an intriguing moment in an otherwise fairly standard movie.
