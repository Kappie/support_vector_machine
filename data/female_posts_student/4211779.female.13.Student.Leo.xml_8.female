Okay,now I revive.I just had Chinese tuition.Same old thing,did some revision.But before that we discussed on some oral pictures.*Sigh*But I'm a little more confident!      Today,Clara has finally remembered to lend me her Ou De Yang[Ocean]CD!His songs are not bad,I must say I quite like them.But the sad thing is,we don't know how he looks like. >.    Uh-oh!My library book is due today!But I haven't got the time to go to the library.Don't even talk about returning it.Anyway I think I have about $2++ fine on my account.Dead again.
