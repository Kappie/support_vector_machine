As we were leaving, he did a donut and got out of the car. So I followed him and got out too. Then he was like, "Go ahead, get in," motioning me to get in the drivers' seat. I was like WHAT? While we were working out, I was talking about him teaching me to drive but I didn't expect him to take me right then! So I was driving! Honestly, I was scared. Like I'm always freaked out about car accidents so I was driving like super slow in the parking lot. Even though I was the only moving car. The first time I hit the gas, I gave it way too much, and I sorta screamed. But I feel like I did a very good job and I just think I need a lot of practice for when I'm 16! I'm counting down the days! 1 year, 6 months, and 23 days! And only 1 year and 23 days til I can get my tempts! I can't wait...although, I'm a little frightened. But that can all be fixed with a lot of practice!
