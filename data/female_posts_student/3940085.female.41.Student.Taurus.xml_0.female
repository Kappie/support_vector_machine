They are giving him a brain scan to see how bad it was and according to his lawyer he must have medical care and they say his health is so bad he might not make it to trial. Ok are we suppose to feel sorry for the sick bastard? I by nature am not a mean woman but I say let him suffer like he made everyone else suffer!   The guy is evil down to the core and when he became president he had people killed that he felt had to much power and posed a threat to him. He had the men in a room for a meeting and than he began to call names of menand theywere taken out and shot. Some were tortured and set free to show an example.   Its unbelievable all the bodies of men, women and children they dug up that he hadkilled. The man and his two sons got off by torturing people and when the list became shorter they would than begin on the persons they had considered friends. In the gulf war he refused to feed his troops saying that God, can't think of what they call their God, would provide for them. I can remember his troops surrendering to Americans just to get something to eat and drink.   What about all those people he has gassed, shot and beheaded ? I mean this guy is so cold that one of his daughters and her husband had to leave their home because there was a death threat against him. Saddam than said that the two were forgiven and that they could now come home. The woman's husband set one foot across the border and he was shot.   So Hussein had a stroke. I hope God does not shoot me down when I say good because he is now getting his own! I say we let the guy rot and just forget the trial and execute the looser.    SUPPORT OUR TROOPS!!!!!!!!!!!! Lets pray that Bin Ladden is next!
