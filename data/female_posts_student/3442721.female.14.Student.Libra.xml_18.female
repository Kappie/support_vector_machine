I love going to explorers though. We had team building and i think we are all a little closer... Except Justin... Don't ask why but ever since i met him I felt a bad vibe. I really don't know why... Anyhoo. I am really bored and I have nothing to do.... So I'm gonna sit here at my comp till it's time to leave
