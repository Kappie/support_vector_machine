Well, I've decided that it actually may be easier for people (since apparently I can be a somewhat difficult person to shop for) if I make a 'wish list.'  So, I'll prepare a list of dvds that I don't have, but want, etc. for the people who are planning on getting me something.  I'll give it to someone in the group and they can choose, mark it off, and pass it on to the next person.  Deal?  Okay... :-D
