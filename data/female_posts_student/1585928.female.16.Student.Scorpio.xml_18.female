It was So crazy that I don't think I should even say what all happened!!, but Friday after school, me, Elizabeth, and Julie went to get our nails done again! Then my sweetheart, *Austin* called so we went by and saw him!! then we came back to my house and got ready and went to the basketball games!, It was pretty boring so me and Julie left there and Met up with David at Cozumel's then went to Rowdy's house and chilled with Austin, Kirby,  Rowdy!..then Preston showed up, and him and Julie really don't like each other right now!, so that was weird! but, its all good!
