Well since I got home yesterday. See, I get this..thing or something where it feels like there is a giant lump in my lungs and my heart feels like its beating faster, and it's harder to breath. And my heart kind of feels like it beats right up to my chest...like as if I was one of those cartoons who are in love and their heart is popping out of their chest. I still can breath but..it's just hard. I'm pretty positive it has to do with anxiety cause I only get it when I am stressed. In 8th grade, I literally had it every singal day, 9th for a couple of months, and 10th every once in awhile. I even got it in Colorado when I still lived there, but I always associated it with nerves cause I would get it before a soccer or basketball game. But now I don't know why I have it cause....I am not stressed. I mean...it's summer. And it's really annoying, cause it's not the most comfortable thing in the world. Ok it's not comfortable at all. It feels like you can throw up but your not naseaus. If that makes sense. But I won't talk about throwing up cause Jessica reads this :) So today was basically pretty relaxing. I went to bed last night at 12:30 and woke up at 11 today...lots of sleep to make up for my lack of sleep from the night before. I got up...had poptarts!...attempted to watch Jimmy Neutron but you know...I had already seen that episode. Cause I'm just cool like that, where I have practically seen every Jimmy Neutron episode. Not to also mention The Fairly Oddparents. And...other various shows, which I am not gonna mention at this time. I then hung out with my dog for a bit outside. Went back inside where I spent the rest of the afternoon in my pajamas watching Family Guy seasons 1 and 2. I think I saw about....6 or 7 episodes today. So that kept me preoccupied till about 4. At 4, I decided it was best to finally get dressed, and I did, and I got to mow the front lawn then. Even though I think some neighbor was trying to get my attention during my mowing, but I don't know. First off I couldn't see without my glasses and second I couldn't hear because with the loudness of the lawn mower and my walkman on with the volume full blast. Let's just say it's so noisy I get a ringing in my ears for about an hour afterwards. So yeah who knows. His problem not mine. Unless...it was my problem...(?). Oh well I am going to stop thinking about this. And I'm thinking about writing another Canning episode soon. ...This episode though might have many many many people I know in it. I'll think about it. I should soon since Canning has been on "hiatis" for awhile.... So now here I am. Absloutly no one is online. And that's a first for awhile. Not even people I don't want to talk are online. Which is fine but...still. I feel very alone. ....Ok not really, I think I'm just kinda sleepy. I should go take a nap.
