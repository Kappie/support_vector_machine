If they can't put correct grammar in the brochure and the website doesn't seem like the profeessional, serious kind, I might as well stop trying, for all I see now is some half-hearted, seedy program. Well, that was harsh. I am not and never will be a beauty queen, and I might as well drop the issue even though it IS scholarship money. I think I'll have to go shred that horrible pink application to make me feel better.  Going to Burberry today to return N's scarf. I think, by now, things have been put into perspective and perhaps life is returning to normal, so I hope I don't suffer from pangs of guilt after it's all done. I feel so much better that I'm driving there, too, for it seems more like a pilgrimage that way.  Orchestra concert last night. S just won't shut up about certain things: according to W and H he's "into older women," etc. and still hasn't found out that some people don't appreciate his lack of humility. And the whole entire time in the green room he was playing the piano. Went to Coldstone with W, H, A and DO at the wheel--one of those trips that you have terrible qualms about while it's happening. D, apparently, likes to show off his sound system and drives awfully fast and seems to be into W. Wouldn't be the first guy, eh? The only way I look back at this situation now is with the same feeling that you recall something int he past but you don't really make much of it.  Winter ball is a stupid, stupid affair and W, H and A love to speculate about who's asking who, etc. and I never realized it was such a big deal. Anyways, it's the night of the Chinese New Year performance and I probably have to show up for mom's sake, so that's my excuse for not going.  I feel like I've gone overly antisocial, and maybe that one decision beginning to bug me. E's out of town, so I barely have J and T. I don't know. It's nice to be connected to people, but it also means placing emotional security somewhere outside of yourself. Oh, what the heck. New semester starts Tuesday, and things are bound to change.
