I have to be at the school at 8:30 tomorrow morning. meh....the earliest I've woken up all summer was 6:00 am to get in the car to leave denver, only to fall right back asleep. but i can't sleep. from 9am to 4pm, it's nothing but running, jumping, stunting, cheering, dancing, and smiling. oh joy.  nathan got his hair cut. i really really really want to see it. he said he got 7 inches taken off in some places, so i'm a curious little pony.   i think i like him. hehe...guess it's not much of an improvement, but i'ts better than "i'm pretty sure i think i like him" or whatever i posted before.  the only thing is, i'm hoping that in my pain of being a single a year, and wanting a boyfriend so bad, that i'm not jumping at the first oppurtunity to say that i'm no longer single, and that i truly like him and want to be with him. that i don't just want to be able to be secure and say i'm taken. know what i'm saying? did that make any sense? it did to me, but i'm not the best at translating the thoughts in my brain into words. *sigh*  but i still won't kiss him....tehehe *wink*
