I should have taken a nap, given my complete lack of sleep last night, but I am still awake, not doing much of anything.  Watching "Ghosts of Mississippi" on Bravo.  It's not a great movie, but I always really enjoy James Woods' performance in it.  He manages to create a character that is oh, so distasteful yet utterly believable at the same time.  Sort of a human caricature.  Even though it gets some things about the South wrong, like almost every movie does, it sort of doesn't grate on my nerves the way some other movies do.  It paints a portrait of Mississippi that, while not flattering, is not exactly damning either.  And the accents aren't completely wretched, so that's a plus.  In other news, I did the unthinkable today.  I went to Wendy's (this is not the unthinkable part) and...wait for it...ordered something other than the spicy chicken sandwich.  Someone recommended that I try the new homestyle chicken sandwich, and it was well worth the try because I highly enjoyed it.  Perhaps I'll have to work it into a rotation with the spicy.  I'm also trying to plan my schedule for the fall, since I have to register on Monday.  They sure don't give you much time when you don't have to be thinking about the law or law school, do they?  Anyway, I'm trying to find something that won't be too difficult on me.  But there are lots of things I am interested in taking, so we'll see.  This summer I'll be taking Criminal Procedure and Administrative Law, so that'll be nice.  At this moment I'm actually looking forward to taking them.  Of course, when the moment arrives, I'm sure I'll be groaning and complaining about it as usual.  Not looking forward to the hot commute.  Hopefully the summer won't be too brutal.  9 minutes until Law  Order comes on TNT.  I'm really looking forward to being able to watch it.  I'll pull out a copy of the fall schedule, sit back and settle in for a long night of television viewing and schedule planning.  Yet a part of me can't help but think that I don't deserve to be so relaxed, that I didn't work hard enough over the past semester to have really earned it.   Not that it's going to stop me of course...
