Right up there with bruising my goddamn ear.  Someone went through my bag in block one. Left the $200 discman. Left the $150 cell phone, and the $20-odd dollars of phone time on it. Took the goddamn wallet with $23.75, my care card, my bank card, my bus card, and my emergency phone list for Ayla, amongst other stuff. Whoever they were, stole Laura's lunch too. So we were both lunchless (I've taken to buying my lunch lately.), and me FREAKING walletless...not good. Broke down a few times today and yesterday. To make life better, it's that goddamn time of the month, so I feel absolutely gross inside, like there's a freaking WAR going on down there, gosh. The only good thing from that is that OBVIOUSLY I can't be like...pregnant, so yeehaww!!  I want my wallet back. I feel so naked without it. And if it wasn't for all my friends pulling for me, and helping me, I would be lost. Absolutely lost. Especially Laura and Nick.   And Steve, you're jsut a big plain, brown, stinky, crusty asshole. Seriously. And you don't deserve any f-ing kindness from me.
