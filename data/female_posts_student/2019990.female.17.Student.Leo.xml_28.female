It's currently pretty late, but I can't go to bed for about another hour.  I'm being an ebay shark, and I love it.  I got sharked out of my first Erik Satie cd, and it's not happening again.  There are only so many to be had you know?  I'm also bidding on Broadway playbills which excites me.  So far I'm winning with $3.  But there's two days left on that one.     I'm currently cleaning for Wonder Woman's graduation reception.  And someone (who shall remain nameless) dumped her shoe basket on my bed, so I could sort them and the bed is currently covered in leaves and dirt etc.  Seeing as it's too late to vaccumm it looks like a night on the couch for Manda.  Oh well, you really can't overcome your own stupidity sometimes.  Common sense along with spelling is hard for some people.     Tomorrow Abner has his reception, and I'm excited for the present I got for him.  I can't reveal what it is yet, but tomorrow post reception I will.  I wish I could be there when he opens it though.  Oh well, can't win them all.  Sadly Abner's girlfriend couldn't make it up for the reception.  Poor guy.  That also frightens me for after the reception, I was invited to learn to play poker with "the boys", and I am afraid they're going to take all my money.  (Abner's girlfriend was thinking about coming to that too.) Which they probably will.  We're each only contributing $5 but that's alot of money if you think about it.  That's two rolls of film, two white chocolate mochas, a cheap shirt, thrift store shoes.  So many things.  Wish me luck, and pray for my financial situation.  I really don't like to gamble, so I don't know if I'm going to have fun.  I'll let you know though.   This sunday is the last day of Sunday School.  Leila and I are going over to Great Spoons tomorrow to get little presents for the kids, and about a bazillion other things I need to do within two hours time.  I know they were difficult at times, but  I'm sad to see my little 3 yr olds go.  They're incredibly adorable.  I signed Leila and I up for 3rd graders next year.  I should really let her know that.  We have stuff planned already.  I'm really excited.  But it's going to be very different from this year. I'm looking foreward to it though, I love teaching kids.     And on a completely different subject, Wonder Woman and I took a trip over to Great Spoons today, and we went to the college there, and found a cool fountain in the park that I definitly want a senior picture by.  I'm excited for my senior pictures now.  I'm going to go to the place that Giles' parents run, and they have a tuscany scene set up in their basement, so I'm going to tuscany, and I'm going to take a picture with my books and Wonder Woman's glasses, and I'm going to take one with me taking a picture with my camera, and one stupid formal picutre for my mom.  Boo formal pictures.  I think I want to wear my Rent t-shirt in my books picutre.  Wow, that was a good tangent.  So anyway we went over looking for a guest book for Wonder Woman's reception, and we met Lola and Mahinda at the Urb, and had an awesome photo shoot outside afterwards.  It was so much fun.  I want to do it again.  Then on the way home, Wonder Woman and I sang duets from Rent, and even acted them out once we got home.  It was a good day.  A sad, but good day.  I am writing Abner's graduation card right now, and I think it may be a bit sappy, and I feel bad.  But I am a little emotional right now, which is strange for someone who has been dubbed cold and souless, and given rocklike attributes.  I hope he doens't mind.   Well I am rambling now, and I need to keep sharking.  Good night/morning/afternoon/eveing to you all.  Keep you children out of the water.  bum bum, bum bum, bumbumbumbumbumbumbumbumbum, BUM BUM!  Cue the red food coloring!
