I got dressed and stuff and my mom picked up Jeanette, and then me and then dropped us off at the Natatorium. I saw Alek in spandex! ha. Well we didn't stay there too long, but I still got to see Alek, awe. Eww some mojo hardcore offended Jeanette when he drove by us and, well, I'd rather not say. Anyhoo, we got Frito Pies that sucked ass from the ice cream lady, and since I didn't like it, Alek finished it for me. We all left, and my mom, Jeanette, and I went to South Park to pay some bills, where I ended up getting two pairs of jeans from Pac Sun. We dropped Jeanette off at home, then came home. Alek had left me a message on my answering machine so I talked to him until 11 or so. We're trying to get our sleeping schedules fixed before going back to school. It's obviously not working for me! Yesterday Tate i.med me to make sure "things were cool" between us. I'm like, yeah whatever dude. Anyway I'm going to their show tomorrow, "Given a Chance." That means I'm gonna have to see Justin, Jeff, Rob and Rob....
