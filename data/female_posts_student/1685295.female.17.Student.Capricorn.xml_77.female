Believe me Dollface, you were there with me in fuckin' 217, you know how it was. If I was smiling, must've been my mother yelling at me to do so, so she wouldn't look like a bad parent in front of everyone else. Furthermore...I am not cute, I dun think my smile is either. Disagree all you want, I've made up my mind Summer and Dollface.  Glad to hear it Dollface, considering I might've been responsible for getting you sick n' shit. And WHO? Do you mean Zashid...or whatever...black guy? HEAVY accent of African origin? What are you doin' showin' other people my smile anyway?!?! I can't get over that, better move on to something else.  Helped my sis clean up her school room for the kiddies n' stuff.  Turns out schools are Darwinian nightmares for teachers just as much as they are for students.  All the teachers there seem to be against eachother, tryin' to rub eachother off. How do I know? Some teacher stole one of my sis' school-issue shelves, and had it replaced with a piece of crap (as if we wouldn't notice!) Dude I hate that bitch now! I cleaned out that shelf of rat shit and other crap and she goes and steals it from my sister?!?! What a whore. We recovered it and left all the stuff she put in it all over the floor, scattered..heh heh heh...  I'm Deadinside and there's my crime for today.  "Smiles only brighten up the day of those who have a bright light shining inside."
