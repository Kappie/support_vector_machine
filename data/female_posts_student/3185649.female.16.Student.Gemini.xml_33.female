What could that possibly allude to? What's the first thing that came into YOUR head when you read it?   I'm guessing that probably what you thought was a little different than what it actually is about. I don't subscribe to the Times (and frankly I'm not planning on it) so when I went to the website I didn't have access to the article. But there was a summary of it that was just as appalling as the story itself:  "The Lives column in The Times Magazine on July 18 gave a first-person account of the experience of Amy Richards, who had been pregnant with triplets and decided to abort two of the fetuses. Ms. Richards, who told her story to a freelance Times Magazine contributor, Amy Barrett, discussed her anxiety about having triplets, the procedure to terminate two of the pregnancies and the healthy baby she eventually delivered; she expressed no regret about her decision."  How would you like to be that kid? Thinkabout it.I don't know what would be worse - growing up knowing your siblings were murdered in your mother's womb right next to you or growing up NOT knowing and then finding out that your mother is the kind of person who would do that to some of her children and not all of them. Either way I would be devastated.  Just a thought...
