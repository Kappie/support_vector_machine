I don't think it really should have anything to do with school anymore - although, school will likely be a constant topic.    My week (that I will invite anyone) Starts this  Wednesday, 7th  and it ends on  Wednesday, 14th .  So if you reading this (and it's between those days,  sigh  I will invite you)    ** Note: The only requirments (for me) is that you place a pic on your profile.  And, that you  urlLink follow these rules .    ***  urlLink Rick, shut up and let me ask for an invite...
