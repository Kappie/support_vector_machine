Live life a little.  I can't always be dieting and staving and trying to look thin all the time.  Maybe genetically I am just not meant to be thin.  In Bio we did a chromatography lab, but our groups really honestly sucked!  We only got like a yellow color, and barely any orange.  She told us that we had to staple our chromatography paper to our sheets when we hand them in too.  I don't even know if my group kept ours, cause I am not the one who put the stuff away.  I don't think the others in our group know the names of me and Amanda.  Whatever will be, will be I guess.  I still think I did like really amazing on that last quiz though so I will keep my hopes high.  Drama was pretty fun today, like usual, but I only got a 75% on my warm-up.  He just has to be such a hard marker doesn't he.  Drama was my thing though, it is my thing.  Something that I was talented at, something that I am talented at.  Thought I don't deserve a 75% but there will other things I suppose.  Other opportunities for marks.  I do have to remember that he is a hard marker.  But still, it was better then that.  Life seems just like going through the motions right now.  I mean I talk at school (except in Bio - I'm like miss queen of silence) and well I laugh, socialize, do plenty of things.  But it just seems like I am going through the motions of everyday life.  That's what I fee like ever time I get home.  It's hard to explain.  I mean I struggle with a lot of things in my life, but now that Chen is over I don't struggle as much with everything.  I guess what I am saying that that before life was unpredictable.  *Will I fail the next test, or will I pass*  You know that kind of thing.  Now I can basically predict the future - what will happen - what will take place.  You name it.  There are a lot more things I can predict now.  I think I like life more when it's just random.  When it throws curves in your path when you least expect it and you have challenge to over come.  It may stress you out, make you cry for hours on and off, but in the end it is all worth it.
