I totally recommend to everyone to go see it.  It's at  urlLink SCU .  After the  show, Bobby, Vaci, Aniko, my mom, my dad and I went to Denny's for a post-party celebration.  The Moons Over My Hammy was to die for and Mr. Moons was hilarious.  For those of you not familiar with The Moons, it is an egg, cheese, and ham sandwhich that is served with hashbrowns.  It is the best meal ever!  Yum!  And Mr. Moons is Bobby and Vaci's friend waiter (they are frequent diners at Denny's) who says Moons with a funny accent.  Anyways, this has turned out to be a pretty boring entry because I can't sleep and have nothing better to do.  Yuck, I really need to go to bed.  That 8am yoga class doesn't  look  like it's going to be happening :)
