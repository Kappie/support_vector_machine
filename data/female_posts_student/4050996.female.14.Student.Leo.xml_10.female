Provided we unite all the facts, testimonies and visual evidence, and don't answer to ridicule, a pair of scrutinizing eyes and a good deal of common sense inevitably lead us to this observation: crafts from other planets, made by older civilizations, have reached this world.  Even with UFOs out of the equation, this seems only logical. Our solar system is dwarfed by the Milky Way galaxy to which it belongs. But the Milky Way, containing 400,000 million stars, is only a mote in the universe. There are thousands of millions of such galaxies, most with their own myriad of stars, having their own planetary systems. If only 1/10,000 of 1 per cent of these planets harbor a civilization — and this is a very conservative estimate — the universe must teem with more than 100 million million civilizations.  Not one of them would have reached us? Among these millions of civilizations, can we be the only ones who develop the necessary means to travel through space? The age of the universe, around 15 billion years, is counted in steps of millions of years. Civilizations with such a temporal advance on us will have developed ultra fast space travel, will have breached the distance gap with other civilizations, and undoubtedly will have discovered us long ago. Our own tender steps in the direction of supra-gravitational propulsion and exoplanetary spectroscopy clarify the huge probability that many other civilizations have been using similar technologies for probably tens or hundreds of thousands of years, and are therefore able to detect and reach the kinds of semi-advanced planets that we ourselves inhabit.  Access to the internet exponentially and quite shockingly accentuates this new world view by grouping our own experiences. The world wide web of computers has truly become humanity's super brain, with its tendencies to dominate and lie, but with an overall prerogative for truth and discovery. The existence of extraterrestrial life is, as it now appears, more concrete than one ever dared to imagine. Researchers and governmental whistleblowers have welcomed the internet as a golden opportunity to finally release their knowledge to the world, without having to struggle and campaign, or without being laughed at in cheesy tv shows. Merely responding to search-engine feeding curiosity made these people come out. Their claims — stunningly convergent and international as they are — seem indeed to refer to something real. Needless to say: there is a lot of chaff mingled with the wheat. But after filtering out the incongruent testimonies, and after reading the scientific studies that exist on the subject, what remains contains a direct and uncolored set of facts, reflecting a truth sometimes too incredible for our minds to comprehend: that UFOs are indeed extraterrestrial spacecraft.  It's understandable, having been there myself, that we're not always swiftly coping with the implications of this conclusion. The surprise stands in the way of the reasoned approach. But this inability to cope with the contextual depth of the testimonies and studies on UFOs, is not at all an intellectual deficit, but stems mostly from the originally conservative handling of the subject by our governmental and military representatives. One wrongfully thinks that the extraterrestrial UFO reality could never be hidden from the public. It's obvious that military and intelligence agencies can indeed cover-up information — i.e. prevent it from reaching mainstream media channels. The combination of stringent top secrecy oaths and bureaucratic compartmentalization are a most effective recipe for covering up any unknown phenomenon. The secrecy has also publicly been effectively maintained, from the early 1940's on, by the conscious debunking of the mental connection between UFOs and possible extraterrestrial spacecraft. The incredulity meeting the extraterrestrial origin of these craft stems even more from our massive cultural abandonment to movie screenplays, in which the UFO subject incessantly gets injected with an overdose of fantasy. The theme of ET life has so often been absorbed into this fantastic realm — instead of being studied scientifically — that a serious discussion on the subject has become very difficult.  The circuit is reconnectable: the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs is slowly but surely becoming a respectable viewpoint. On the basis of a series of credible testimonies — from Air Force commanders over nuclear guards to NASA astronauts — UFOs can now be considered as advanced aerospace shuttles from a non-Earthly origin, intrinsically not unlike our own shuttles (in that they are machines travelling through space), but of a remotely advanced character. If we surmount the mental blockade and accept this to be a serious reality, only then can our world view climb up to the next level.  You, dear reader, will appreciate just as much as I did, that the extraterrestrial subject is of the utmost importance to mankind. We are so fortunate to live in an age where humanity is finally but slowly able to envisage the cosmos as it is. Undoubtedly, the acknowledgment of the extraterrestrial reality will have the most profound impact on our lives. It would confront us undeniably with the fact that we all share a small planet, a village which we must manage together and whose resources we must preserve for future generations. With the recognition of the true existence of extraterrestrial life, we can enter the adulthood of mankind, attain true self-awareness and responsibility, and begin to unravel the world of heavens for what it really is. Our genuine cosmic place can only be appreciated if we can recognize ourselves as one amongst others. This truth is the most important jump a conscious species can make. I therefore wish you a stable leap.  Thomas Deflo, MA in Philosophy
