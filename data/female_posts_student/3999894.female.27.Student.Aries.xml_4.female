I'm not sure how to get links to appear alongside the text (or indeed how to get the archive to appear a bit further up the page) so I've put it here as a post but ifanyone who knows how to do that please do get in touch! I'm happy to post up links to sites of interest for Lea Bridge residents so if you want me to put a link to your site let me know - in the meantime here is the link to Emmanuel's website  urlLink http://www.emmanuelleyton.org.uk/
