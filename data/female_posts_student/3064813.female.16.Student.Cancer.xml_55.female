Good thing about being overly excited... if my brain has an apocalyptic fit from lack of oxygen, I'll just pass out and BREATHE normally again.  Because... wow.  Very exciting day.  WHY????  Let me tell you... non-existent people that don't read my blog anyways....  REASON ONE TO BE EXCITED:   UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT!!!!  So, there's this guy.  This guys name is Josh, and I like him very much.  Want to see the first "conversation" I can remember us having??  It goes something like this: Josh: WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? Me: ...Sarah. And that was pretty much the extent of it until RECENTLY when we actually started talking and... you know.  Having conversations that consisted of more than five words between us.  And then TODAY he got my phone number and there was much calling and now something's going on which may or may not be classified under "one of those high school things" and now I think my heart is trying to bitch slap my stomach.  Or something.  And I keep forgetting to breathe.  REASON NUMBER TWO TO BE EXCITED:  Karen has six days until she turns sixteen and gets to DRIVE IN THE DARK!  Huzzah!  Let's all throw our arms up and CELEBRATE and then mourn the death of the citizens of Boise.  REASON NUMBER THREE TO BE EXCITED:  SCHOOL IS ALMOST OUT!!!!!  Enough said.
