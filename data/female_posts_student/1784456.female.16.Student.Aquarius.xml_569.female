Okay, so you know that I said that my life was boring... in a kind of way, well that changed yesterday! *breathes in* (it's good to do that every once in a while) Weeeel! My cat, Brodie managed to get himself covered in kerine (?) the painty stuff so we had to give him a wash! It was really hard cause we were kind of doing in on the table and he kicked the bowl of water over so I got a load of keriney water over my trousers! (I think I've got it out but they still stink a bit!) So then my mum phoned the fet and guess what? Wow, that's right! The vet said we had to cover him in margarine! So we did and we got it every where and he kept trying to bolt! Aww, he looked soooo pathetic! Then I had to keep him from doing anything for ten minutes! It was hell and by the end of it I was covered in margarine too! You wouldn't believe how hard it is to stop a cat from eating the margarine it's covered in! Then we had to wash him again so we got him in a head lock and tried to wash him in the sink! He's still covered a bit, and his hair's all manky! Eww, but he stinks of fat and it's all gross! Hey, that actually happened!
