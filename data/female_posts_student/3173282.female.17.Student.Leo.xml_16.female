I came home and slept till 2:30 then me and my fasha saw Van Helsing. It was a good flick. Very gothic-like and dark but i really liked it. I wanna look like kate beckinsale. And hugh jackman is hott. "If you're going to kill someone, just do it. Don't stand there talking about it!" hahahaha. Truu same goes for if you wanna fight someone. Ahem. hmmm i realy like the all american rejects in case u haven't noticed lately. They're cooool. Tonight was sad. I can't' say why...i'm just sad. byebye kids.   As i go, remember all the simple things you know. My mind is just a crutch and i still hope, that you will miss me when i'm' gone.
