Started the day at Vic's Accounting at 9am: I sit at a desk, answer the phone, pick up T1-83's, file money, learn log books, check messages, book appointments and assorted other tasks. I left Vics at 3:30pm and started Roger's at 4pm. At Rogers, I was asked to come and do a full fucking shift. Gah! So I came home at 3:35 and then changed into Rogers garb. Put that on...and walked out the door to start at 4pm. Didn't get home till 1:20ish. In the fucking morning people!  Closed with Jamie today. He can be a huge asshole, but at times...a good decent guy. Protective of his car...extremely.  What else is there. Talked with Dana. Yes my friend...there are things I miss about you. Like talking to you every once in a while. Meh. C'est la Vie my amie...I assume. Anyways. Honesty is the best policy. Thank you for being harsh with me cause I did need it. I know see how much I lost myself.  Gordon came into work...good guy! one of the regulars. He's going to bring me a couple books to read.   Hmmm. My head hurts. And I GOT MY GRAD RING TODAY! FUCKING RIGHTS! I'm going to check email, blogs and assorted linkage....
