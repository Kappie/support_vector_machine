(o'_'o) gee.  Anyways, i seriously think there is something wrong with my skin. one reason why i turn red, or in simpler words,  blush  easily, could be due to the dilation of my arterioles located near the surface of my skin. on the other hand, my blood capillaries and arterioles could be just a hair's breadth from my skin! (although it may sound rather ridiculous)  yet if that isn't the case, then why is it that i get red and tanned easily?   While we were training for the campcraft competition under the scorching hot sun this morning/noon, we had to carry our metal pegs and run around the tracks on the field at the same time. i was holding one peg and a mallot on the other so that slowed me down and i got pretty exahausted before my face became bright  red . once again,  sir benghui   had  to make fun of me in hokkien.. but it's not like i have total control over what my body does right? aiii. in addition, during one particular npcc meeting that was held in the np room,  mr lau  came in and spoke to us and asked why my face was red. he  actually   thought  that i had make up on.  Another time when ruth, jessica and i wento sentosa beach during one of the marking days, ruth and i got so badly burnt that when i went to school a few days later, taufiq and the guys called me "lobster" and all kinds of 'funny' names. haha..but it was incredibly horrifying then? cos' my face swelled up and i had to see a doctor. ruth even ran a fever and got me so worried. when we returned to school (reluctantly) after days of rest, people wanted to help peel our skins cos they  assumed  that it was  fun . hurhurr.   On a brighter note, japanese cucumbers are awesome as it helps to cool and at the same time, whitens and brings glow to your face.   Method:  1. Peel off the skin and put it in the fruit juice extractor 2. Mix the paste and juice together 3. Add a little fresh milk/olive oil 4. Dip in cotton wool and put it onto your face for 10 minutes 5. Clean off with water  Have fun trying that out! :) peace out. xox.   P.S : You know you want to see  urlLink this .
