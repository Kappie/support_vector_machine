The Sightings visited KDU, a college in Damansara Jaya, after receiving information that KDU has been recording unusually high frequencies of paranormal occurances in its campus. The crew members went incognito as to avoid giving indication that the campus was on close watch. Some of those activities, deemed appropriate for public veiwing, are as follows...    Sigthings 1: THE GRAB  At about 3.30 p.m on a Wednesday evening,(dates will not be mentioned to protect anonymity of subjects), the cafeteria of the campus was dimly lit. The sky was dark, forewarning students and crew members alike of an approaching storm. Students dotted the cafeteria, randomly that is, in small nucleus like groups. Then, a group of students, dressed in aprons, complete with the hair cap and little knives slid up their arm pockets, came and sat on a table very close to counter while some of them chose to stand and munch on their grub. While they were enjoying their meal, one of them, stood up from the chair, and in a swift motion, grabbed the buttocks of his friend! With quick reflects, the guy subjected to such an act quickly turned his body to avoid further contact. He also gave a nervous glance to the Incognitos (since they were only a metre away) to see if such an act was seen. Unknowingly to him, this incident went as far as to be published...  Sightings 2 : THE PLOT TO LOCK  At the dark ground floor of the campus, there are clumps of rooms, strategically placed as to form a nearly perfect hexagon. There are six rooms, and all of them functioning as science laboratories. Incognito crew members turned their attention to one of these labs. On that Tuesday evening, the students in the class were in a jovial mood. Just that moment, they decided to play a trick on their Biology lecturer. Upon further investigation, Incognitos found out that that lecturer was the last one you would play a trick on. Surely, some mythical powers were working on these students. Sly yet very much aware of the consequences, they locked the doors to the lab. Meanwhile, awaiting impending disaster, they continued their noisy chatter. Soon, the 'click,click,click' of the door knob refusing to allow the entrance of a person was heard. Everyone hushed. Outside, cars were passing by casually, the trees were swaying lazyly and the sun was slowly dimming. Apparently, only this shiny, everlasting orb was aware of what was going to occur. A student then briskly ran,unlocked the door, and sat, all in under 2 seconds. The lecturer rushed in, and asked without much ado.  "Which one of you locked the door..?"  Her facial expression was enough to let the cat out of the bag. The students knew that she was a trapped dam about to burst.  ".....(the name)....".  Thankfully, oh, thankfully, she turned her attention to something else...much less devastating...  *****  With that, Sightings would return with more paranormal activities in our next edition...  Remember..."the truth is out there, and the Sigthtings will know...each and every time..."
