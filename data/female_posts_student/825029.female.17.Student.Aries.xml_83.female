BAM!  Word closes.  and my project is gone because i, being the stupid person that i am, DID NOT SAVE.  3 hours of work.  gone.  it was about 930 at this point and i had to redo everything.  talk about disappointment.  so, reluctantly, i did it.  i still had my "interactive notebook" to do, too, but i thought i'd get up around 6 to finish that and memorize a poem for english.  but of course, i slept through my alarm this morning until 730, and i had to rush to get ready and get to school.  so im extremely stressed out.  im tired, i looked like absolute crap, and i still had tons of hw to do.  thank GOD i had all of first period to work on stuff.  i'd like to thank liz and mooney for making my crap-filled morning as best as it could possibly be- you guys rock.  anyways, so i did hw during band and finished up my interactive notebook.  so my day continues... bcis was pointless, as usual... then mentor was even more pointless, and then we get to lunch, which is always the highlight of my day.  i vented to mooney a lot during lunch (like always heh) and then we get to math.  i made a 105 on my test, but i was in too much of a bad mood to even be excited... but my day continues.  i get to wd history (the worst class ever).  so im sittin there, checking out other people's interactive notebooks, and im like "hmm everybody seems to have 3 more pages of notes than i do".  so i keep looking and i realize that im MISSING more than HALF of my notebook!!  so i am freaking out.  and then julia comes in and shes in the same situation as i am!  so we're like, what the heck.. how did we not get these notes.  and then we realize that we werent there that day!  she had been absent and i had left that class halfway through to go to the doctor.  BUT we had both asked dutton if we missed anything and he said "no".  WTF?!  so i did half of my notebook in about 5 minutes.. it looked like CRAP.  (theres another bad grade in that class...) and we got some grades back in that class, which didnt exactly excite me, if you know what i mean.... so that made everything worse.  and then i get to english, with my poem unmemorized, but we're taking an 18 point test on poetry which i had completely forgotten about until 2nd period, so i was totally unprepared.  and it was hard.  writing definitions?!  geez i thought it was gonna be like matching or something.  and then band was just... well, it was band.  i was very NOT into it today.  i wasnt really paying attention to anything and was just sort of in my own world, and i didnt really care about anything.  so yeah, thats my day in a nutshell.  so much more little stuff happened that just added on to my crappiness, but im too lazy to type everything.  maybe its the lack of sleep.... ive gotten 6 hours in the past 2 days.  yeaaahhhh, and im still going strong! hmm wait, maybe im not... sleep sounds so incredibly nice right now.  anyways, i better get to my hw.... *BIG SIGH*  when will it end?!
