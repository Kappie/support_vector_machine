Her auburn hair spilled down in curls to the base of her slender neck. From Sarah’s eye a single tear fell saturating her red satin dress. She looked around the room; in the dim light she guessed that there were twelve people in the room each as desperate as her. Looks of absolute misery plagued the faces of all that occupy the area. An acrid smell burnt at Sarah’s nose. Her eyes searched for the source. In the proximity of what use to be the buffet line the lay a pile of cans in disarray. One of the cans had been punctured in the side. Its contents spilled onto the floor creating an expanding pool the crept closer inch by inch. Atop the drum a black box hummed softly.  Wham! ...    A sound came to the heavy door at the top of the stairs. The banging increased. With each beat the door’s strength slowly diminished. The brass hinges creaked as they began to pull out the wood frame.  Boom!  With resounding finality the door crashed to the ground sending dust flying into the air. Sarah jerked her head away startled by the noise, and when she returned her gaze she made out a silhouette of a man clutching a shotgun. Shrouded against the night sky she couldn’t make out any of his features. The figure stood for a moment and then swung the gun onto his shoulder. He walked into faint light. Blood flowed from his abdomen across his thin white shirt onto his dark jeans he however showed no signs of pain.  “Somebody call a taxi?” His voice sliced through the silence. Sarah’s eyes glossed over with uninhibited joy. “Dirk!” She exclaimed. “I thought you were dead.”  Dirk walked over to her and picked her from the floor. Her reached for her hands and tore through her constraints.  “Happy to disappoint.” He grinned. It was apparent he hadn’t shaved in a few days. He gazed at her and reached around her waist. “Give me some sugar baby.” He leaned in and their lips locked. They kissed deeply each of their hearts bursting with ecstasy. Dirk abruptly pulled away his demeanor changed to one of seriousness. “How long ago did he leave?”  Sarah looked about the room. “About twenty minutes.”  Dirk relaxed slightly, but from the veil of darkness a man in a business suit emerged. He drew his arm quickly from his side. The barrel of his socom pressed firmly against the side of Dirk’s head. The man sneered.  “So predictable Mr. Martin. Always the persistent hero.” The words crept from his mouth with emphasis on every syllable. “But I have a feeling that your luck has run out… Time to die Mr. Martin.”  --------  “Its shit.”  George slammed the manuscript down on the table. He was a short man in his late thirties with dark brown hair, slicked back. He wore a black pinstripe suit and had a neatly trimmed goatee. He looked down at his nails and spoke with an air of stern finality. “Its complete shit.” He exhaled.  “Mark?”  A man at the end of the conference table snapped to attention with speed that would gave an ordinary man whiplash. “Uh, yes Mr. Smith?” He swept away a strand of wavy brown hair that fell into his eye. Mark seemed strangely out of place he was the only one wearing street clothes. He had no idea why George made him attend every meeting he was only an assistant.  “Go get me some coffee and a muffin.” George spoke evenly. “And if its poppy seed, I will kill you.”  Mark stood up from the table and quickly left. George looked around the table and answered everyone’s questioning glance. “You get better service if you threaten them a tad.” George cleared his throat. “Alright, now which one of you bastards gave me this piece of shit?”  Two chairs down a middle-age man with a receding hairline waived his hand timidly. “I did.” George looked at him through green slanted eyes. “Who are you?” “Bob. I run the creative department.”  George fingered with his tie, observing the checkered pattern. “And what sort of movie do you think this script would make? Because it sure as hell wouldn’t be a good one. It would be shit, like the script.”  Silence filled the room like mustard gas. Bob glanced at the script before him and then to George and then back to the script. George’s stare burned the side of his head. A look of confusion fell upon his face. He stumbled through his words forming ideas as they escaped. “Was that rhetorical? Because you kind of answered your own question.”  George opened his mouth when Mark burst through the door carrying two cups and a variety of packaged muffins. He approached the head of the glass table and set the load in front of his sovereign. George eyed the assortment his eyebrows raised.  “Why are there two cups?” He demanded.  “I wasn’t sure if you wanted decaf or regular.” Said Mark. George glared at the cup near his right hand. “I hate decaf.” He wrapped his fingers around it and hurled it out the window. A grin came to his face. Mark shifted awkwardly. “Uh, Mr. Smith that one was regular.”  “Damn.” George grabbed the other and heaved it out the same window. From below the faint scream of a woman could be heard. George sat up in his chair unaffected by the occurrence. “Right, well back to business.” He selected one of the muffins from the pile and swept the others onto the floor. “So Bob. Do you think that audiences will like the fact that the movie killed of the main character? Mark! Why are you still standing? Go get me another cup of coffee!”  Bob shuffled in his seat as Mark walked to the door. “Well, we thought that that aspect of the script was um, kind of original. We liked the unconventional ending.” George stared intently at Bob. “You mean when the annoying sidekick pushes the bad guy into the piranha tank?”  “Umm, yes.”  “ Bob, do you know what an ulcer is?”  Bob nodded.  “Well you and this script are giving me one.” With that George threw the script out the window. “I could write better than that. ‘Gimme some sugar baby?’ they stole line is from Army of Darkness.” George sighed sinking deep into his leather chair. “Every summer it’s the same thing; mindless action movies, always poorly written and full of plot holes. But if you throw in a few explosions and some nudity no one cares!” The door opened and Mark walked into the room clutching a cup.  George lifted his hands into the air. “Why do we do it? We are making movies that no one will ever remember! Everyone will remember Die Hard, but is anyone ever going to remember John McCann: Man of war? Why do we do it?”  Near the end of the table a man wearing thick wide brim glasses raised his hand. George nodded at him. He spoke confidently. “Money. We do it for the money. Man of war grossed ninety million. And the one before it grossed seventy-eight.”  George took the cup from his assistant and leaned back. “Good point. Mark. Go get that script from the parking lot… and some skittles.”
