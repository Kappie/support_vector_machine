I have no clue, but whatever, haha, today I have German and I get to watch the scariest movie ever in German, the Wizard of Oz, oh how I hate that movie! Me and Embry are just going to get under a table or something so we don't have to watch that scene with the monkies and the witch...ahhh...can't take it...I mean the little munchikins that were singing in german were BAD ENOUGH! Anyways, ummm I wanna go back to bed, but no I have school and we don't have a break until Thanksgiving :(, this blows...embry and kiera shutup, I know what yall are thinking when I say blows, dirty lil whores...
