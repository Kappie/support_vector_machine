And I'm going to speak in confusing little phrases because that's what I do best. I'm tired of just loving and this is why I want to leave. I'm tired of being tossed from guy to guy, some little rag doll of some sort. I'm just tired of everything. And I want to live in my little fantasy world and tell you so much. Tell you everything. I want to pour my heart and soul into you to make up for what has happened over the past couple weeks. I want to take care of you so badly, whether that involves a steady relationship or not. I want to hold you when you're upset, and kiss you in hopes that everything will go away and all will be better when we wake up together. I want all of this so badly, but I can barely stand being placed in a corner with no expiration date. In my opinion, I've already expired... I'm gone and I lost you or what I thought was you for so very long. I've been placed in the proverbial trash can that has now consumed not only my heart but my life as well. I let the feelings get the best of me, and I don't know how to change that. I don't know if I'm able to change that. I don't know if I want to change that. I'm not scared to say this anymore. I'm not scared to fall off bridges or careen into placid seas. I'm not scared to say that I've utterly and fully fallen for you. And I'm a sucker for love. I love you.
