I'm having a really good time at TAP because I finally got a fun part and I like the people a lot.  Today was pretty long though.  I have to be off-book by Monday.  I'm hoping that will turn out ok.  Caroline and Allison came to visit us on Wednesday, which was great because I love and miss them so much.  We were trying on costumes.  I found it quite entertaining that when Caroline zipped up the side of my dress, the zipper pinched my skin, leaving two little red marks on my side.  It looked like a vampire bit me, or maybe a viper struck me.  It didn't even hurt that much, it was really just funny.  Then yesterday, Philip Boyne got home from Rome and started TAP so now he drives me, which is good.  I'm pretty glad that I don't have to force my parents or sister to drive to Cary Academy every day anymore.  But, yeah.  I feel like I haven't seen anyone from Enloe in forever!  Tonight I went to see in Dylan in the STAS Intensive production of the Laramie Project.  I've always heard about that play, but I'd never seen it.  Very interesting and insightful.  And the acting was marvelous, of course.  I'm really glad I went to see Dylan. Now I am eating Chinese food and listening to Franz Ferdinand.  I am really getting into them.  I want to buy the cd.  I saw them on Conan O'Brien the other day, hahaha.  But I feel kind of gross, so I am going to go take a shower.
