Dont lock me in a cell Please, dont send me down to yell" Hope and anguish Screams from my soul The pain I cant control From all the hatred I hold A living nightmare Night as my curse Sorrow immerced I ride in a hearse On the way to hell You sent me down To Hell Im bound Cant mutter a sound My halo has fallen And my wings are charred I dropped my guard Now, my heart is scarred.
