It turns out that James and I can pass of for bro and sis... ~I have been teaching a majorly huge amount and spending way too much time trying to plan a recital and way not enough time on what's really important (like blogging...) ~And what ever happened to the HUGE snow storm that never materialized??! ~I have learned that scrabble can be addicting. Please play with caution and moderation. ~Jody- keep up the good work with your alcohol break... and I would say nothing wrong with counting down. I count down lots of things! ~Tiffany- I hope that you will not give up on your dream for a new watch... AND you now have me worried for my car inspection... I am just a day away from my inspection month. YIKES! ~BE SURE TO WATCH THE 8PM OSCARS TONIGHT!!! ~and last but not least: the pro and con to my great sat. night out:  pro- I had a great time seeing familiar faces. I attended a wannabe class reunion. Tiff you soooo shoulda come! Good times. con- I have temporarily lost the ability to walk as normal people do. This is very sad news... not being able to walk is unacceptable for most people but this presents a much more extensive challenge for the dancer in me. not so fun :(  Hobbling until next time....
