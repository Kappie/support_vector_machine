I've been wearing my contacts lately, and it's good, but it kinda sucks. Because I get to actually see my face clearer when i look in the mirror. Ugh...nightmare of breakouts.  Well, and blau.  "My life is just swell. Fuck off."  That was random.......wow, I really am tired. I'm going to go...be productive...or something. Though I don't have anything to really be productive on. That's okay though...I'll just randomly walk in circles n such.  I have the taste of vodka in my mouth. I don't know why. Kinda rather strange.  Okay, enough rambly-bambly shit. Adios crazies.
