' that hurt...that really hurt! cause how did we know how it was going to turn out! it could've gone either way! then he was like  'yea but ou never gave it a chance'   yep, just give the knife a twist! its not like i wanted it to end like it did! o and i anoy him! hmmm go me! i think im jus tfeeling like i used to feel, like im not being accepted for me being me, im just annoyin people... its just little things that make me feel like this:S   i think the thing that started it off was floyd. he was talking to kim and maisie about kim and steve and stuff like that, and he turned to her and said how she's not good enough for steve and he doesnt like her as much because she's getting too much like me!.... a simple comment..that leaves a painfull scar....  i mean i know im not going to get on with everyone....but i just cant help thinking why?! whats so bad with me?! what is it about me that annoys people and makes me not fit in?! ive tryed not to be so me-like...but is an endless stream of unhappyness worth pleasing a few people?! i want to just be accepted! fair enough if people dont like me...but is there any need to make spitefully comments?!  its not that im depressed, cause im happy, but i keep having patches of possibe depression and morbid moments, facinated by the shiney-pointedness of sharp objects...almost pathetic, but uncontrollable earges....  Too Afraid  You lock yourself away In hibernation mode When night turns into day You stay in your abode  Still running from your pain Turn to an only friend It opens up your vein You're wishing for an end  You watch blood trickle down A warm flow to the floor You notice it and frown You'll need to do some more  You're cutting yet more deep That one will really scar "Forever let me sleep" You wish upon a star  But you don't have the guts And so cheat death once more "I couldn't go past cuts" You think and hit the door  You wander off to bed Bleeding on the sheet The wish that you were dead A thought you will repeat    drastic..but utterly amazin! and no i didnt write it *unfortunatly* its.....incredible! she's amazin! a genious! i dont know how but her poems mean so much tome...they've really touched me.....
