Maybe 7 years later on their final episode, they will get together when Elliott flies to Paris or something. Haha.  Sometimes I think I take too much for granted. People have given me so much, but what do I have to give back? Nothing, really. And it's sad. Ugh.  Ok, from tomorrow on, I will be doing REVISION REVISION REVISION for my exams... AHHH~!!!
