You know, I just realised that when we were talking about Valleyfair. I don't know why it just popped into my head then. Maybe cause I feel like shit all of a sudden, cause I turned out to be a total bitch this week. Maybe cause my body realises what day is coming up, and I try to forget about it. I don't know, but now it brings me down a little more. I hope I can still have fun at Valleyfair, without bringing everyone down.
