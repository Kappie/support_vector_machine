My room is becoming progressively less cluttered, it's a beautiful thing. I want it so that my room is organized and fully functional by the end of the summer. This is because my room gets pretty bad when I'm in school and every extended vacation or day before a party that will take place in my room ends up a suzie clean fest. Not always a good thing. So I want my cupboards clean and everything in its place. I know my mother is planning a garage sale pretty soon so I'll scout out the stuff I'm ready to be rid of. That's probably quite a few things.  FYI: bethie if you would like to set up another station of stuff to get rid of I'm sure I could handle that. If not... Well I think I'm accompanying you to the hair dressers during the "five hour hair fixing" so you can join me in front yard bliss.  I've determined that I really have no clue as to when and what time Bethie is coming home. I'm assuming Sunday. If it is Sunday that's tragic. I won't be home from about 4:30 pm on. I will be at a back yard BBQ at one of the club people's houses. It'll be lots of fun and there will be lots of good food but I won't get to call bethie if she isn't home by then.  I woke up at two today and still haven't done much. I plan on editing tonight but shhh don't tell my fingers.  First things first though I plan on continuing cleaning my room.  Wow the spell check isn't working. This is bad.
