Infact,knowing anyone who is sick is not a good thing. knowing those ppl who are sick is not a good thing, but   knowing some1 who is close 2 you is sick is a BAD thing  there is a difference. Jonathan has been sick for a week now, and according to ppl, he is REALLY sick. i dont know whether he is worry or just plain sick. but wateva it is i hope he'd get well soon. Or maybe Jonathan is fine...Jenny you worry 2 much...]  Jenny
