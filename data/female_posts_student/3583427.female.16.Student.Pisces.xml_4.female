Tee hee, I'm on the phone with my AShley right now. Blah. She's so cute! She has too much homework. Meh. School is alomost out, though, so WOO HOO!!  Anyways, getting to my day. It wasn't so bad. The weather totally sucks. I'm getting so sick of looking at the grey sky. I want to see some sun. Mhmm...Well, meh. I know, I say that quite a bit. Anyways, about the provincial. We had to think up of 3 Life lessons we'd like to pass on to the next generation. Here were my Three :  1.] Act as if there is no one to imrpress but yourself. 2.] Be your own person, you are capable of making your own decisions. Don't follow the crowd. 3.] If you want the rainbow, You have got to put up with the rain  Hey, I guess I can relate to all three of those. ESPECIALLY # 3. It's probably the truest statement that I have ever heard of. But yeah, I just felt like sharing that.   Now, for some pictures. Woot!! Lol. They're all from my friends b-day party on the 5th of this month. Enjoy. =)=)!!
