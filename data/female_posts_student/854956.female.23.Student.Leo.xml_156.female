It's gonna suck to go from school to work again... especially considering I probably won't be able to fall asleep at a decent hour tonight.  I think I'm gonna have to pop a couple sleeping pills to make sure that I can get enough of it before my long day tomorrow.  I'm also going to have to deal with the book situation again starting tomorrow.  I'm not looking forward to that at all.  Oh well.  Can't avoid it... and the only way I would've been able would been to have gone to campus last week and buy books ahead of time.  But then I'd have to deal with the horrid situation that is returning books.  There's just no winning.  I'm hoping that we don't have to shell out $650 for books again this semester.  That was just horrible last semester.  I mean, they've already hit my parents with a 1.8233% rate charge on the credit card payment for tuition... which was higher than usual already because of tuition deregulation.  My Mom wasn't pleased at all that she had to fork over an extra $45 because she paid with a credit card.  And that happened because they no longer mail bills.  You pay them at Fiscal Services (and wait in a long line) or pay them with a credit card via our online service.  Grrreat!    Anyhow... I'm a bit excited to see people from last semester's music classes!!!  :-D  I've missed all but one a lot more than I thought I would.  They're just so much fun...!!!  Especially Allyssa... she's a funny one, she is!  Anyhow, that's all for now... I'll post more later in the week to update on how everything's going.  :-P   SIGN MY GUESTMAP, PLEASE .... :-D
