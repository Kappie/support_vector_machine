Anyway, now that my stupid ol' observation of the day is done and over with, I can continue my path of enlightenment.....i mean blogging. I dunno, obviously I'm in an odd mood right now. WAIT! when am i not in an odd mood? haha. Before I continue any further, however, I would like to formally state that the clay aiken kid's name is Kurt, not Kirk. my bad. I was close enough....whatever. today was anything but boring. it was unboring. i dunno if unboring is even a word. i will make it a word. i yelled at/talked with ryan today...yeah, i'm really not sure how things are gonna be. whatever. hmm....i was totally in a blogging mode, and full of stuff to say, but then josh had to call and disrupt it! geez, thanks josh! freakin a! ok, im over it now. haha. anyways, back to my day. hmm...a few days ago tommy asked me to come to his house and watch movies with him, and i totally shot him down, but because i thought he was joking. well, he wasnt joking, and asked me again today...i kinda avoided the situation. haha. in physics i was hitting on sam, that was fun. i dont know if he is used to having girls hit on him. hopefully 'operation make sam my friend' will work. haha. i'm not too sure yet. well, that was pretty much my day. on to doing homework/procrastinating!
