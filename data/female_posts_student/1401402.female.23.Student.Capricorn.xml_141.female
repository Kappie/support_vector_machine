I claim seven tickets, went with six friends, it was so cool. We all ate so much except for Phuong. She's one of the tiniest Pettit girls with the biggest boobs I have even known. Didn't know what it was like until we got there. The game itself was very exciting, call me stupid but I didn't know which team I was suppose to cheer for. Of course I knew we were cheering for the A's but I didn't know what color was their uniform. We had a binocular but most of the time I was checking out the guys' ass.   Towards the end of the night, we all were pretty buzz, the A's were losing badly, I got pretty upset and it ruins my night. I figured even no doubt concert was so much better. Before we left the game I went up for more beers, stood in line with a friend all of a sudden I felt so hot, I was getting dizzy, I felt so numb from head to toe, then I went black out for a couple of seconds. It was a good thing I didn't crash or fainted but pretty close. My friend had to rush me back to my seat after that the miserable pain went away. My gosh, wtf was that? Can someone tell me why I had that feeling? It was so scary for me. Apparently this was the second time that happens. The very first time happen four years ago when I was pregnant and now it's happening again. Is there something wrong with me?  Saturday, went to the dentist, the doctor told me that I've got one cavity. God damnit I was horrified. I brush my teeth twice a day, floss before I go to bed, rinse my mouth with Listerine and still I have a freakin cavity. Had to get a rout cannel and my plan for the night was ruin. I was hoping to go to 1999 rave but no I wont be able to drop. Whore shit I cant do anything. end up staying home, slept through the whole afternoon, woke up watch Along came Polly and stuck eating porridge. Afterwards I crash into bed again, supposedly the medication that I took had codeine in it and it makes me so sleepy everything.   Sunday, took my daughter out for breakfast at denny's, then took her to Six Flag Marine World. Had some free tickets why not use it rite? We had a great time, it was so hot but we stay there for five whole hours.
