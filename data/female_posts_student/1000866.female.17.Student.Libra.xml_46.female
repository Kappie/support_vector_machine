I just can't believe what a...jerk he's been lately. At lunch today, chris, and him, and I were all standing around talking about A auditions and stuff, and Dave goes, "Yeah, I know who's going to make it into Wind Ensemble, but I don't want to say, because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings."  So then chris says, "Well, will I make it?"  And Dave goes, "Yeah."  HELLO?!?! Could we be anymore obvious? I thought he was supposed to be smart. Man, I just couldn't believe it. It's probably the jerkyest of jerky things people said to me today, and people said some pretty jerky things. RAR! I'm probably just touchy because I'm so scared for the results, but really...he crossed the line there. I hope I get into Wind Ensemble just to spite him.   OK, sorry. Anyway, they DIDN'T POST RESULTS TODAY! Argh. Could they be anymore cruel. This is just mean! I'm dieing here! OK, not really, but it's still mean.  All I want is to find out, for better for worse.   Argh, no one else, not even Dan, was as big of a jerk to me as Dave was. I thought he was so nice, and I started getting to know him better this year. Heh, I don't think I want to anymore.  Seriously, I'm just all touchy because I want to know. I'll probably feel terrible for writing this after I find out, and he's right. I think he is right, and that's what bothers me so much.  Heh, I took this quiz about what alcoholic personality I am and I was a, "Sex on the Beach." Hah, it's kind of ironic when I think about it. A: I don't drink ever, and never will, and B: I'm remaining abstinent. It said something about me being promiscuous. Haha, ok, so it didn't actually say, "promiscuous," but that's the impression I got. Plus, I love that word. Promiscuous...haha. So great.  Wow, I was totally completely flipping out today, it was bad. I could hardly pay attention in any of my classes, and I couldn't pay attention with Kelly and Emily during lunch. Heh, ohhh wellll. I'll be better tomorrow. Probably a lot sadder, but at least less psycho.  I really wish I could talk to Heather about something right now. I miss having her there to talk to. I've for sure...well, no, I haven't. Argh, such a hard situation. I think it may just be because of recent circumstances.  Haha, I have two new sayings now, "oh, fiddlesticks," and"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!" Haha, I love saying those for some reason. Ah...beautiful!  Yeah, so I really have nothing else to type, except..oh, we listened to our CD of the last concert. It was actually, not bad! I was shocked! Completely blown away. everyone kept complimenting us, and I was like, "Nah, we really aren't that good at all." I heard us today, and we aren't bad! YaY!  OK, I think it's definitely time for bed. I'm getting into the "Highlands" stage. Thanks Brett. That's such a great term. Anyway, sleeeepy time for Catie. :) Hopefully, if I can sleep...without freaking out about results!!!  You know who it is, why bother sign it? :) XOXO
