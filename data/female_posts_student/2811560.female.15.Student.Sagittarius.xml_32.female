I guess the construction workers at school were welding or something, and they set off smoke detectors, which in turn set off the fire alarm, which caused the entire school to go outside. (Lucky me, I was in my gym uniform) So we're all standing outside and its snowing, its like 35 degrees. All of a sudden, about 20 minutes after we came outside, you see this guy running around without his shirt on! Ok, whatever, the teachers caught him, he put his shirt back on, end of story. So about 5 minutes later, you see another guy running across the field, WITH NO PANTS ON! He ran a little, dropped his tighty-whities pulled them up again, and then started running again! Finally he was caught by a teacher, and I guess he was arrested for indecent exposure or something like that. Needless to say, we won't be seeing hin for a while. But oh, so funny! That made my day. Anywho, I practiced my music with Ms. Gibson today. She told Kelly and I that we were starting at 3:05, but Kelly wasn't there because they don't let cars in while the buses are still there. So she missed it and Gibson was NOT happy. Ha, what now Kelly? What now? Hehe, I can't help if I don't like her, its just she's my competition...meh, I try. But yeah. So I have a voice lesson today, and then I going to see Contest Play and GI. Fun stuff. Speaking of GI, Noah broke up with his girlfriend, Alyssa! When I heard that, I looked out the window just to make sure the sky wasn't falling. Seriously, I never in my wildest dreams thought they would ever break up. That's too bad, I guess. Oh well.
