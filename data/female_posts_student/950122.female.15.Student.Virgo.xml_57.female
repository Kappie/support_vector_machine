I'm sure I failed it.. and I know that I fail Trigo this quarter.. >  Anyway, a few nights ago I felt like crap. Why? Because I passed up the opportunity to go to a friend's house to go to a Christmas party. Then what happened? I ended up losing my transpo and not going to the party. Right now I'm just telling myself that everything happens for a reason. Gah. On the brighter side, I got these kick-ass platforms from my auntie! :3 They're really comfortable and the design is cute too. :P Plus, I look taller when I wear them. XD Anyway, I went to Greenhills yesterday with my family. I bought the Sims : Making Magic! But something's wrong with the cd... n_n;; Never buy pirated, eh? At least I've installed it. Now I just need a cd that'll run properly.  It's settled. I'm going to the prom. Most likely without a date, but who cares? My mom suggested that I take my cousin (Tristan?!?!) as my prom date, but I reasoned with her, telling her that he'd wear a tux, but have army boots on. n_n;; I'm getting a bit worried about my dress. I haven't been to the seamstress yet; actually, none of us have been to the seamstress yet. Plus, I don't have a design. I'll probably just rip something off the internet and modify it a bit.. n_n;; If all else fails, I'll just guy one. It can't be that bad. :P  I'm worried about my family. My mom just had a checkup, and her blood pressure is really high. She's taking medicine and not doing much around the house now. Dad, on the other hand, always seems to get on my mom's nerves, and just this morning I woke up to hear mom nagging dad again. Like usual, it was about money. My mom does all the budgeting, and my dad just loves to spend. It's not exactly the best combination, especially because we're not exactly rich or anything. My parents don't work for goodness sakes. We're just relying on dad's pension.. That's why I try my best not to spend too much. Because if I do, I might not have anything to fall back on.  *looks at her computer clock* Wow, only four more days 'till Christmas. n_n My aunties (My mom's sisters) will be spending Christmas with us this year. They're coming here tomorrow with my grandma from the province. I wonder what will happen this Christmas. I can expect the unexpected because my mom's sisters are crazy! They all have these trademark laughs. 0_o I hope it'll be more fun than last year.. *looks back*
