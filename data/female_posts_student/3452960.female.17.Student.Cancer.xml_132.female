We filled a water cooler with beer, but Vicky would not let me drink out of the tap. Grrrr. Anyway, It was good. Briony is clearly the legend of Twister. (she actually fell over  before we started and that takes skill) Hope your parents don'tread this though Bri...   Also, what the hell is up with John Smith's? It has one of them widget things in it, so the can froths all over the place, and then when you drink it, the first 2 inches or so is head. It's ridiculous.  Ho hum. I'm going out now, so I will see you all later. It's raining.  Oh and kudos to me for writing so much so early in the morning.
