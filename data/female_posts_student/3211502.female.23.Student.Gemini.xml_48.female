I cannot believe how delinquent I have been in regards to creating new posts. From now on, I resolve to make an update at least once a day. However, this does not mean that every single post will be deep and/or thought provoking.  My lack of posts is a direct result of having my mother and little sister come to visit. They arrived at JFK on Saturday, June 20th. My mother left a week later and my little sister just left this past Friday. During their visit (3 weeks long in total), I've been busy attending family functions, keeping them entertained, tagging along to college visits, buying an insane amount of furniture/household items for my new room/apartment.  But, now I am all by my lonesome yet again. I really do not know how to keep myself busy. Especially in the aftermath of all the non-stop action these past three weeks. When my mom left and I was left in charge of my little sister, I tried to keep her as busy and as entertained as possible. What did we do? Too much.  Some highlights: * The Boy from Oz. Vanessa really wanted to see this and it was definitely one of my must-see Broadway musicals. After waiting for over an hour in the TKTS line in Times Square to find that the musical wasn't even one of the musicals with tickets for sale, I booked it over to the actual theatre. There, I was able to snag Student Rush tickets for the same, if not a better price, than TKTS. Let me just say that Hugh Jackman is H-O-T in Leopold form, Wolverine form, and, amazingly, flaming form. * Keith Foulke sighting. While we were walking down Broadway in Times Square, Vanessa noticed Keith Foulke (aka the traitor/defector) walking in the opposite direction with his wife and baby. We are not 100% ure that it was him. But, if Keith Foulke has an Asian wife and a half-asian baby, it was definitely him. * The Central Park Zoo. This was my second attempt to find this elusive zoo. The first attempt was with Garth. After walking from the west side to the east side and back from the east side to the west, we were unable to locate the zoo. This second attempt was with Garth and Vanesssa. After asking four vendors in total, we finally found the zoo. And, thankfully, it did not disappoint. Of note, a polar bear doing laps and live turtle porn. * July 4th at A60, the rooftop bar of the 60 Thompson Hotel. Partied with assorted family members (Aunt Nora and Uncle William were staying at the hotel over the 4th of July Weekend) and Nicole Kidman. Yeah, Nic and I. We're tight.  I can't remember anything else. I really should have written some stuff down. Lesson learned.
