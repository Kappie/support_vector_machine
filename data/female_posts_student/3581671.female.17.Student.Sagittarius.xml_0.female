I'm scared that this summer I'm going to get bored and eat and get fat.  My goal is to not gain any weight this summer and to run a 21:30 5k.  Last night I saw Shrek 2 with my sister, it was cute.  People said it had a lot of adult humor in it but I didn't really find that much. hmmm.. I hope there wasn't too much I missed, I'd feel very immature.  anyway... today; throat is better, eyes not so itcy, nose not so good and neither is cough.  I'm tired of writing now and can't think of anything relevant that I want to talk about.  Not now at least.        Peace           katie
