Now i know your probably thinkin why in the world does it matter if your chewin bubble gum when a truck passed by. Well i know i didnt mention this before but that truck, it was red. AND i was chewin watermellon bubble gum and well watermelons, there red too. It was a sign i was convinced. Now i know that you sayin well I see red trucks everyday but thats you city folks. Yep i only see a truck about once every week when the mail comes and it blue. A red truck is a pretty unusual thing of what you be seein around here. Now i couldnt see the driver but when i was asleep last night i was dreaming that i was chewin some whatermellon bubble gum. and you wouldnt believe it unless you had seen it, but while i was chewin my watermellon bubble gum a truck passed by it was red. and in my dream there was an old man with a beard drivin. He looked like a city folk.  maybe a city country folk cause he had tattoos and wore a black vest, like a motercycle ridin person is what i amagine. a motercycle ridin person is all i could figure him to be. And you know how i know that my dreame was rite. cause he is been sitin right there in that booth at the back of the caffe by that window. And see that is the red truck, that one right behind him, that i saw when i was chewin the watermellon bubble gum and i think i should get a beard like that but then i would look liek a motercycle riden person liek how that guy in the back of the caffe by that window and i dont think id care for that too much." The guy in the back of the caffe by that window got up and walked twords what he thought of as THE LOUD MOUTH.  "I just over hered you and i wanted to let you know that my name is Jed and i have never seen a motercycle in my life. THE LOUD MOUTH grabbed the hand that Jed stuck out. "HI im Jeff and I just figured you did." "Jeff. You obviously know what i drive. What do you drive?" Jeff smiled                  "A motercycle."
