Whoo, my register at work was 35 cents over last night...it was good.  I work again tonight from 5-11. Then there's going to be a kick ass little party. Haha. No, not a big, exciting crazy one that you're all invited to. Too bad I have to be at work at 8 tomorrow morning. What fun.  Oh my gosh, some guy from southlake came in to work yesterday and totally made my day. I told him his total and he was like "What? that's outrageous..I live in Southlake and it's cheaper there. There's a sign outside of here that says 'thank you, keller' and I feel like saying 'up yours, Whataburger!'" Hahaha....I started cracking up, because he was a funny guy. And when I deal with plenty of rude people, it's always good to deal with people that have a sense of humor.  Well, I guess there isn't much else to say really.  Things have been very good lately. It's great.  Well, have a wonderful day, crazies!
