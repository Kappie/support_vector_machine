However, I do not want to go into the meaningful part of it. No, I want to talk about the hot guy I met!  Now, at one point, they gave us sheets of paper. Half of us had words, and the other half had definitions. I got matched up with a rather lovely lad from another school. He was a self-proclaimed hippie environment kinda guy. Usually I find that rather weird, but when he's pretty, he's pretty!  Our word was "scapegoating." For the less vocab-ulated among us, that is blaming a person or group for something that is not their fault. Case in point - Jews being blamed for economic crisis in post-WWI Germany by the Nazis.  SO we're trying to think of "personal" examples, and I'm trying to break the ice over the fact that neither of us had experienced it. Him: "So.... well... I mean, there was the Holocaust...." Me: "Yeah.... don't really know of any others. DO you?" Him: "No, and I've never really been scapegoated or anything." Me: Me either. *pause* Me: But, ah, it has "goat" in it, and goats are pretty cool, so..... HIm: *smiles at my patented blend of beauty, intelligence, and oddness* Yeah. I'll a gree with that. *laughter* Me: DO we have to explain it to them? Him: Um.... I don't know. but if we do, I'd definitely go with the goat escape. *laughter* SUpervising kid: Ok, so y'all are going to make skits. Me: OK... so pick another animal. Him: Um.... one that pertains to a goat situation? Me: Sure. Whatever. Him: a rooster. Me: OK. SO let's say it's been raining a lot at the farm,a nd the rooster's like, "It's the goat's fault!" Him: *hahahahaha* Me: SHould we use something else? Him: No, I think rain is fine.  SO, we come to perform our little skit. I read the definition.  Him: Wow, it's been raining a lot lately. That's not very good. Hey, I bet it's because of you! Me: What? Me? It's not my fault! I'm just a goat! I don't control the rain! HIm: Well, how else do you explain it?  It then deteriorated into the laughter of the rest of the group and us doing our best barnyard arguments. Cute, but not incredibly productive. I was trying to figure out how to end it....  and I   head-butted him   on the shoulder.  Head-butting is an inside joke with my friends. We do it at random as a fake fight instigation. It is quite funny to watch. If planned, in a skit, it makes people laugh. The group was falling out of their chairs and stuff.  However, I do not suggest randomly head-butting people, especially those of the opposite sex in whom you have the capacity for interest. Because i was too afraid to talk to him at ALL for the rest of the day.   America's young leaders: pretending to be barnyard animals.....
