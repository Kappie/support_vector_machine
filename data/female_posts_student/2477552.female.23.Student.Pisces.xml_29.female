I thought it was supposed to happen around 25, when you are changing careers from being a professional student to a successful professional, or hopefully in my case changing to a successful high school teacher.  Instead I am 23, newly 23, with more on my plate than I'd like to imagine.  Why is it that when you are five, no one cares if you would like to color, but when you are 23 suddenly wanting to color isn't considered to be such a good career choice and more than likely it will soon be considered a character flaw.  I don't think that I can grow up. Honestly I want to dance around the room and play dorky music all day. But there's no one around to play. Everyone is too busy with assignments, papers, children, and real-life.  Maybe I'm just tired of staying here at the same school for soooo long. Maybe I feel like I am stagnating. Maybe if I wasn't an only child I wouldn't have such an imagination that I would have gotten past this growing up thing a long time ago.  More than likely I'm just sitting here thinking "C'mon let's go, let something happen." I am tired of the same-old same-old, but everytime that happens life comes up, smacks me upside the head, and I realize the silly nature of what I had just said. If I wasn't so mature, maybe I'd let myself color everyday. *  *Is it a bad thing that I own a nearly brand-spanking-new carton of crayons with an additional pack of 8 space crayons? lol.
