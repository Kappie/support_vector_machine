Such joy I feel! :)  I will never be sad again. Now that God is on my side. Mwa haha!  I don't know...but with God I just feel powerful.  Anywho.  I went to my grandmas birthday which was interesting.  My aunt cooked the food it was quite tasty. I love my aunt. She welds glass! You should check out her website: http://www.sharonagnor.com/    Have I told you how the Improvathon is in 17 days and I HAVE LOST MY FUNNY. Ah!!! I am totally not funny anymore. Like not funny at all. I think everyone on my team is suffering from lack of funniness.  From sunday-tuesday we were together for 15 hours. WAY TO MUCH!!!!!!  I am getting sick of them. Hahha. But I still love 'em. Its gonna be scary to be on a plane with them. Haha. And at Disneyland. The funny thing is, i'm not afraid of messing up at the competition I am just afraid of DISNEYLAND. I have like a ride-o-phobia. They freak me out. I can do the tea cups and small world, but thats it!  :)  Talk to you all later!   Laura Fantora
