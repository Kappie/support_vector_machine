I only know that they found something small because Ed was able to check it out, but he isn't a doctor and can't read some of the stuff.  But it said something about it mostly being normal with a small finding...I don't know.  So yes for all of you who know me well know I am wiggin' and well the dang headaches which were going away are coming back again in pretty serious intensity levels.  UGH  HELP ME PLEASE!  I am so tired of this, missing all kinds of school work.  I am tired guys.  Just tired.
