I just noticed that it posted the same thing three times and when I tried to post a second ago, it like spazzed so I had to log out. *sighs* I got some lovely news from Bobby the other day. Supposedly, Tim is now a DAD. Ya kno, Tim who was like ObSeSsEd n StAlKeRy after the talent show. But yea, a chick that he was with ended up pregnant n she just had the kid n they don't kno if the kid is his. Sorry, but that's just way too young and sooooo disgusting. Thank God I turned him down even though it was for Brad. But at least I wouldn't have to worry about being used for sex. Not that it would have happened...he would've gotten b**** slapped. FO SHO! lol. Not that I WASN'T used, but hey, maybe it wasn't B's intent. Who knows anymore. Guys can be so stupid. Anywho, I need to call Loren later *the director for Godspell*. He called earlier just out of nowhere to give me audition information, and I was going to answer but my phone doesn't like me either and died. I have decided I am loved by Loren and the rest of the Curtains Up group *like duh...jk, jk* I mean, I was freakin MARY in their Christmas show for Christ's sake...no pun intended lol. I'm out.
