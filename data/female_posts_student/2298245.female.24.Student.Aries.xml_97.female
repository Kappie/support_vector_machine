I guess people often surprise me in a good way because I tend to assume the worst about people, and I've come to realize that most people really aren't as bad as I think humanity is.  I'm often taken aback by generosity and kindness from unlikely places.  But today, something I've been feeling about someone has been driven home to me in a bad way.  This person is normally sweet, and friendly, and now I am beginning to see the light, that all is not as innocent and supportive as it seems.  You hear stories like this about law school, about people being two-faced:  seemingly friendly and eager to help, but really deviously plotting behind your back.  But you'd think that after you've been in school for awhile, you would have figured out who those people were.  Yet they are continuing to surprise me.  And disappoint me.
