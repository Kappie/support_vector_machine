Well as soon as Jeff leaves, Diesel sits right in front of my bedroom door and whines. Not only does she whine but she seriously, like, tries to beat my door down. I kid you not! She bangs into the door and then she takes her paws and drags them down the door leaving scratch marks all over it. Yeah. This is how every morning goes. I try and ignore it until I can't take it anymore. And don't think I don't yell at her and tell her to stop. She'll just look at me wagging her tail and as soon as I shut the door she's at it again.  Every  morning. Anyways.  Did anyone catch the season finale of Smallville last night?(That Tom is such a hottie!) If Chloe is dead I'm going to be  VERY  upset. I hate season finales. They're so nerve-wracking. Now I have to wait, what,  3 months  until I get to know what happened? Torture.
