So, anyway, since I haven't written in a while....maybe I'll catch up. I already wrote about Winter, which I guess is the best/most important thing that's happened in the last few days. I don't think I even wrote in here I was planning on asking anyone. Haha. Actually...I hadn't until Saturday sooo....I guess that makes sense that I didn't write in here.  I think I might be getting sick unfortunately. :( My throat's starting to get pretty soar and every time I yawn or something like that, my ear hurts so I'm thinking I might have an ear infection. Ick. Nooo fun.   I think I'm going to really like my classes this semester. Maybe not weighted essay writing but eh...you can't have everything, right?   Wind Ensemble's pretty much the same. I got kicked out the other day. :) That was actually rather funny. We were playing Gavorkna fanfare and I can double tongue sometimes and sometimes I can't and he told me to play alone in front of everyone and I was like..."ummm, no. I can't," and he's like, "go practice it then." And I just got up and I left. I think he expected me to stay and actually play it but I was like..."no, not in front of everyone." And then, today we didn't have band since they're all at IMEA :) Whoo. So, I sat around during band trying to do the homework I didn't do last night. That didn't work at ALL.   Second hour, I now have History. That's a big switch for me since I used to have it seventh. I have Mr. Rosanova too, which is cool. He seems like he's going to be a good teacher. I mean, we've gotten homework every night, but it wasn't difficult. So, that should be fun. Plus, Jamie sits in front of me and he's so hot. I mean....he's a complete jerk but he's still hot.   Third hour, I have gym again. good times. I'm taking basketball....bleh. The last time I really played basketball, I got a concussion and ended up in the emergency room but, it's not bad because at least I'm in gym with Matthew and Chris and stuff. I don't really talk to Chris much during gym though. I think he wants to hang out with his senior friends haha. Oh well. We played knockout all day today. It was fun. I even won! YaY!   Then I have French again. Whoo. Good times, good times. Not much is different in there from last semester. Ari sits in front of me now though so we get to talk and stuff. And I'm sitting next to Katy, my only junior friend in the class. :) I also found out I got like...a 94 on the final for last semester without studying. YaY.  Fifth hour is psychology. I'm really really excited to be taking that class. Like...tremendously excited. It's funny though because Dave Kaiser's in my class....heh heh. That should be interesting. He's also in my gym class. So, three periods out of my day, I'm with Dave. Is that not incredibly scary? Anyway, we took the final for the class today. She wanted to see how much we knew before we get into stuff. We did these interview things for the past two days where we interviewed another person, then introduced them to the class. This one kid...oh dear. He sits across from me on the other side of the room and the person that interviewed him was telling us about how the kid had been arrested 9 times. 9 TIMES! He's only at most 18. He''s been charged with 7 counts of battery and 2 of assault. Oh, he's a boxer too so....that's always helpful when you're being charged with battery and assault. I was just like, "Note to self: Don't make big angry boxing kid mad."  Then Sixth hour is lunch. I have it with a lot of cool people so that should be fun.   Then weighted essay writing....ughhhh. Drive a fork into my eye. Please. I just know I'm going to hate that class with a deep burning passion that eats away at the soul. Ohh well. At least Bryan's in it with me so I can wine to him. Plus, Todd's in that class too and then he's in my math class last hour so we complain together when we get to math. Haha. Good times.  Then, obviously as previously mentioned, I have math with Mr. Danbom. I think that'll be fun. He seems like a cool/nice guy.   And that's my schedule. Whoo. I hope this semester goes well. I can't believe this is the second half of junior year already. That seems insane. I'll be a senior next year....creepy.  I guess I might go work on homework now. OK, probably not. I'll probably go read but it's ok. Reading is....sort of educational....  Question for the day: What does, "Word to your mother" mean?
