And if people don't like that, they can shove it up there ass :). Well I couldn't sleep lastnight, due to all the hous pocus shat going on. So I tried to occupy myself throughtout the night, btu at 1 I started feeling sleepy lol, I'm so lame! So I slept with my sister Karen... Jacob kept waking up and crying, so I thought "bov for this" and i went back into my bed at 7, I slept until 12. Since then I have discovered some kind of green mucous coming from my tumour, it's not pleasant. Well yeah, meeting Tab at four, should get cigarettes. Soz, you have to see this conversation:   Good Old Ouija Board   says:  im gon get posessed lter   Jess - I'm not listening to Rusted Root...  says:  i dnt fink u shud    Good Old Ouija Board   says:  y   Jess - I'm not listening to Rusted Root...  says:  cuz wot happens if ur tumour starts leaking green shat?    Good Old Ouija Board   says:  then i laugh   Jess - I'm not listening to Rusted Root...  says:  lol   Jess - I'm not listening to Rusted Root...  says:  cough     Jess - I'm not listening to Rusted Root...  says:  lmao!   We should be going to Kri's after that. We should cheer him up and play  with his purple stuff :)  That is all, toodlepipxxxxxxxxxx
