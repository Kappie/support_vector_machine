I am tired tho, cuz I waited until 12:15ish for my baybie to call... but yeh, he was out with this dad and got home late.  But, he called this morning, and he wants to go for a walk in Green Timbers Park... so, I might go out.  If not, I'll be stuck at home, doing nothing, on another boring sunday! =(
