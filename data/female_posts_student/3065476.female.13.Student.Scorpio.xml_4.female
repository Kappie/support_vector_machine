Oh, I have one thing to say... I wish I had internet at home so I didnt have to do this at school. Then again, I wish for alot of other things too, none of which will come true, I guess. Like having a pet, and a camera and a real computer, not a laptop that keeps freezing. Too bad. NOW I'm done. Good Bye.
