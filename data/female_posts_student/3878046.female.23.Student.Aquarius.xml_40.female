And of course my suspicions of what people think of me were confirmed.  Yes I am that girl who's pretty cool to have as a friend but I'm kinda chunky and jsut not attractive.  yes it's a shame. Story of my fucking life, it's nice to know that I've made such an impact on someones life that that's all the mention I get in something the length of a novel.  Now I love this guy to pieces and I know he means no harm, but I can't help feeling let down.  It's the sadness that comes with knowing that you've made some of the best friends of your life, they've impacted you, you'll never forget them, but that you've barely made a blip on their radar of life.  When you find out you're no one to people that mean everything it's pretty devastating. 
my first year at university I got to know this exchange student from america, we were pretty good friends but when she went back she cut off all ties in england.  I thought that was a shame, but I think I'm starting to understand why she did it. 
I want to go back to Tennessee so bad.  I had such a great time there, even with all the bad stuff that happened.  But I know that if I did it would never be the same, never be as good.  It's almost as though none of it really happened and it was all just an elaborate dream.  if it wasn't for the physical scars it would be so easy to completely erase all evidence of this year out of my life.  I won't, I don't want to.  That's one of the reasons I'm so keen to keep in contact with everyone, so it doesn't become just a faded memory, because no matter how surreal this year did happen.  And even if I'm forgotten, everyone and everything that happened will stay forever treasured within me.
