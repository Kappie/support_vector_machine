Add a computer. Hook it up to the internet. "And you have a voice in a country where it's very hard to be heard ..."' Nice! Maybe that should be in our tour."   The idea is so interesting and profound.  Will Iraqi women soon be blogging, er, when they have electricity?  So, I checked out the  urlLink article   posted on a Persian website.  Feeling dumb tonight, so I won't attempt to write anything on the article, save that it's interesting.  Below is one excerpt that is on topic:   "Thousands of Iranian blogs have cropped up since late 2001 when an Iranian emigre in Canada devised an easy way to use the free blogging service Blogger.com in Farsi. Though several English blogs outside Iran are read by Iranians, the most popular ones are in Farsi and operated inside the country."  The question that initially popped into my mind after seeing the article's title was how secure these women feel in their anonimity when publishing blogs.  I also thought about the effect that the ability to effortlessly publish political fare on the net will have on government.    One last reflection for tonight.  Would it not be lovely to live in a world in which customer self-service credit/debit card processors (the grocercy store and deparment store variety) were standarized?  Ah, to automatically push the correct button and swipe my card in the correct direction - and in the correct order - without thinking!
