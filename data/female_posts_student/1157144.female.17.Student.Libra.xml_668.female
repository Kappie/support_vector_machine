He dresses like some Chicago hoodlum schmuck and speaks in broken English.  HA HA HA.  And he just got this chick that is supposed to be his brother's wife and she is a whore.  Major hoochie.  She was even hitting on Jackie CHan.  Oh god, Jackie Chan and his old movies crack me up.  So what is up with this group.  It has been real quiet lately and I haven't gotten any calls about doing stuff.  It is weird.  It is like some bad shit went down and I don't know...  LOL, you guys gotta watch this movie.  Big Brawl, so dumb, gotta go.
