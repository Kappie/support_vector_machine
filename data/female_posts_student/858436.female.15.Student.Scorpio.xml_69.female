Honestly, I really don't take religion that seriously. I rarely pray. Last night, I got home and prayed for the first time in months. The whole time I was just thinking, "How could they do that to someone and find pleasure in it?" It was a lot to comprehend, and it still is. I definitely recommend seeing it.
