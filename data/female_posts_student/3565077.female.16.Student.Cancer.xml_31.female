(this is the girl who starts blogs, does about 1 post, then abandons them...)  well, hi anyway. today has already been a rather eventful day, i woke up wanting to die and now i don't. isn't that encouraging? i think so...now i'm just hyper about what god is going to do in dungannon. because he says he's going to move here, and i'm completely convinced of that... i believe a cheer is called for. YAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   last night i discovered something useful: scribbling relieves tension very well! here's my 3am artwork...    urlLink Mail0018    depressing, but oh well. hmmm, i'm thinking i perhaps should do some maths revision, considering my exam begins in about 2 hours. it's my last one. but i've done crap in all my other ones, so if i can do this well it can be my "dying swan" thingmybobbie. do i ever make sense to anyone apart from myself? perhaps not, but that's how god made me!! *grins*
