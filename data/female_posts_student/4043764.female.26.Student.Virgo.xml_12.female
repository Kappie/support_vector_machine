The  urlLink Illinois Senate race  sounds like a typical senate race everywhere: two wealthy, Ivy-educated men running for office. In this case, they are both African-American men, the first time in American history that this has happened in a Senate race. And when it's two brothers running against each other - oh, shit... what is a citizen to do? Well, I can tell you that Keyes is already playing the race card to sway votes: he  urlLink called  Obama's pro-life stance "the slaveholder's position" and mentioned something about "picking cotton". Oh, yeah, and  urlLink Keyes is running for God . (Perhaps God will be pissed when he loses.)  There's a great  urlLink article  about this race on the  urlLink black table .   Do the kinky stuff *after* you're in office and the economy is good.  The original Republican candidate, Jack Ryan, is out because of some kinky shit he's done. Fellas, a little advice: if you want to be a politician, please do not ask your wife - even if she is freakydeaky and discreet as hell - to stick her tongue up your ass, put a baby's bonnet on your head and spank you for being a naughty baby. The shit will come out if you divorce her; she will be embittered that she did not get part of the successful husband pie, she will be all "I got him here", etc. Unless your name is William Jefferson Clinton, it won't fly with the (generally) sexually conservative American citizenry.   Republicans fear  urlLink Obama  . He is a rock star, an example of the diversity that we keep hearing about but rarely see acknowledged in the efforts of our politicians (i.e. they treat us like we're all the same person). He is an African-American man who has an immigrant parent. He embraces ideals that are forward-looking, intellectually inspiring and pragmatic. His vision, I think, acknowledges past hurts and emphasizes the role of these in crafting a better future. He is idealistic.. and he lacks experience in drafting and moving legislation. But the people love him.   Alan Keyes,I, as God, pronounce Illinois your home state.   Keyes, an articulate man, is not even from Illinois. The Republican party are trying to pull a Hilary Clinton, except in this case, Keyes will be asked: Cubbies or White Sox? And perhaps this is an appropriate question, given their proclivity for sports celebrities as potential candidates: former Chicago Bears coach, Mike Ditka, was one of these. Mike Ditka. Can I write it again? Mike Ditka. I can see the thinking around that one: "Well, he  is  pro-life...And he has a show on ESPN radio... Let's give it a shot." It was lucky day for the people of Illinois when Ditka declined the offer.  Anyway, I think that part of the selection of Keyes is not in hopes that he'll win the seat (Obama really has had momentum coming off of the convention and has had weeks upon weeks of campaigning without any opposition), but to show Americans that the Republican party is "diversifying." It's a pretty sad ploy because the only thing he diversifies in the party is skin color. He is ideologically - to the point of idiocy - ultraconservative. Yet, he continues to be a caddy in the good ol' boy's club (apparently his house is on lien and he used to pay his own salary out of campaign budgets to make ends meet)...  Learn more about  urlLink Keyes  and see why it would bea shame to have this guy in office anywhere.
