Just trying to help a friend.....which scared the crap outa me. Got locked in the bathroom by Dee and Francesca. It was funny. I climbed the wall but....i didn't go over lol. I've been so worried.......Cindy walked in the house with us after the bus and right when i saw dad he's like 'moms in the hospital'...ya really great...how much worse can this day get?..just watch..that one girl's gonna IM me and start talking shit. I know SOMETHING will happen. I'm so worried about my mom....and my friend. *sigh*....why cant things just....be better..happier. I mean...family is coming on friday or saturday...we're supposed to be happy to see Mya and Sophia!.....*sigh again*.....And of course..the one day Deidra's in a good mood im worried to death about something. Dad didn't even bother to take the cell to the hospital so i have no clue wats going on!!! Too much stress right now....   I'm not, not caring.
