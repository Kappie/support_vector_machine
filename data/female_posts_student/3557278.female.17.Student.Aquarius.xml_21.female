We went to Avoca for Chris' 18th, it rocked :-) We stayed up heaps late and did the usual stuff, except there was NO SURF which sucked. oh well it would have totally stuffed my shoulder. OH yeah, i got a haircut on friday too hehe. mmm...yeh anyway about Avoca, it was uber fun! Mainly because i could just get away and not have to worry about anything else. it's funny because its such a little place and feels isolated, but its only about 1.5 hours from home. actually it took a lot less that that driving home, but i cant BELIEVE that the weekend is over. I'm shocked.   i'm going to have a bath and write when im in a better mood. then go to bed, try and make up for the total lack of sleep of the past few nights.  later
