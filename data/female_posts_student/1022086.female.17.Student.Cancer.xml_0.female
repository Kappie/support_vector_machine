Clint came over to join Ale and I in finally viewing  Cowboy Bebop, the Movie . So yeah. Good stuff. *Flashback*  We're sitting around and talking before playing the movie, and suddenly, Clint says, "There's a red, flashy light outside your window." Puzzled, we look out the window, and there are a firetruck and ambulance in my driveway. Ale and I look at each other and simultaneouly say, "Abuelita," (that means "grandma" in Spanish) and rush downstairs to find my uncle and the 911 folks. My grandmother is moaning and whining worse than an old dog in pain would, and the ambulance guy, Scott, whom I know well by now (sad, eh?) waves at me. We realize that we're just in the way and go back upstairs. A bit later, my mom calls from the hospital (my uncle has called her up and told her what's happened, evidently) and tells us that grandma fell down the stairs-- again. Anyway, we proceed to watch the movie. The animation is awesome and the storyline sad as usual. It's pretty good, but I preferred the series to it. The series was simply majestic.   While Clint is in the kitchen exchanging his final goodbyes for the weekend with my sister, I pet Shah and discover that he's lost an unbelievable amount of weight. He is very much skinnier than he used to be. I don't think he's been eating much, and anyone could tell that lately he's been down. So, I think my poor kitty is so depressed that he's not eating now. Great.    At about 2.30 am I roll into bed. I set my alarm clock for 12.00. I sleep and wake up at 12 but decide that I could just get up at 12.30; that'll be better. About 12.15, my sister jumps in and pokes at me. I went to bed not feeling too good since I haven't been feeling well all week; therefore, having to watch her jump gives me nausea. She then proceeds to take my blankets and pillows away just for spite, making me fall out of bed. At this point, I whine out in agony, and after an extended battle, I am able to kick her out of my room, go back to bed, and lie there until 1.20 . So, then, I get up and enjoy some wondrous mellow music. Am still in considerably good mood.   I go to the kitchen to make my coffee and discover that my grandmother downstairs is screeching in supposed pain, as she has been doing all night. Obviously, my mom is highly annoyed. I don't blame her, but I, too, get annoyed with the situation as well as my mom's bitchiness. I tell her I have some 60-something Chemistry problems left to do by Monday to go along with a test over them as well as a few chores to complete, yet she starts listing things I need to do for her. I'm about to say, "I'll try," but before I can get past, "I'll," she splenetically says, "All right, never mind. You're just like your sister. Simply can't ask either one of you to do anything." At this point, I'm almost over the fence. So, I say, "I do too do things for you, thank you very much! And you didn't even let me finish speaking!!" I don't know how I managed to storm out like that and live to tell the story; this has to be the first time in history. Any other time something of the like has happened, I've been vituperated or grounded, if not worse. So, I go to my room to straighten a few things while I wait on my coffee to be ready, and I find my sister splattering paint all over the place (she was frescoing for a class). There is red paint all over the white bathroom door, and I get annoyed, because obviously, I will be the one who will have to clean it in all eventuality.   Then I go to the kitchen to drink my coffee. At that point, daddy decides to have fun with my brain by means of his incoherence. And he is   really   savoring my frustration. So, I snap out of my mind and just leave.    I live with a sporadically snappy artist, a melodramatic hypochondriac, a depressed cat, a manic-depressive uber-stressed materialist (oh, how I hate materialism), and a mentally ill other. And then folks tell me that my house isn't  all that bad  as far as preposterousness goes? My sister decided to minor in psychology. She claims I really am obsessive compulsive, and the more time passes, the more I think she may be correct. Oh, yeah, and I'm a teenager, and sadly enough, the stereotypes are true, and the teenage years suck in every way, particularly when you're nowhere near where you want to be.     "She's Electric" by Oasis    She's electric  She's in a family full of eccentrics  She done things I never expected  And I need more time  She's got a sister  And god only knows how I've missed her  On the palm of her hand is a blister  And I need more time   And I want you to know  I've got my mind made up now  But I need more time  And I want you to say  Do you know what I'm saying?  But I need more ....  Coz I'll be you and you'll be me  There's lots and lots for us to see  There's lots and lots for us to do  She is electric, can I be electric too?   She's got a brother  We don't get on with one another  But I quite fancy her mother  And I think that she likes me  She's got a cousin  In fact she's got 'bout a dozen  She's got one in the oven  But it's nothing to do with me   And I want you to know  I've got my mind made up now  But I need more time  And I want you to say  Do you know what I'm saying?  But I need more ....  Coz I'll be you and you'll be me  There's lots and lots for us to see  There's lots and lots for us to do  She is electric, can I be electric too?
