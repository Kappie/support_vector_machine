I was in the   PiNK   group with Jessica Hernandez and Lisa Cleveland and I love those girls so I was like HELL YES! And then I found out that I'm not in Mr. Bigelow's advisory anymore   :-/  ...But I am in Mr. Harris' now so that's freakin awesome!! After Fish Camp, we were waiting for my sister to get there to pick us up and like Brittany said in her little journal thing...Me, Brittany and Jessica acted like   typical teen girls  ...I won't say what we did but it was so much fun. haha, I loved it. Then I came home and fell asleep then my sister got home from the barn and wanted to go to TCBY Yogurt waaay out on Fredricksburg so we went there...Then out to the barn...Then I went tanning and then we came home...And had lots of fun. hahahaha. I love my sister. Oh, me and Brittany have discovered that we are freakin OBSESSED with Subway. I'm not even kidding. Oh, and I like the way it's about 2 days until school starts and I have not even BEGUN to work on my 3 summer reading assignments. :-D Yeah..Well I'm going to the lake today then   SLEEPOVER   at my house tonight!! YAY!
