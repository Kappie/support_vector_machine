Bec went FULL-ON and spent about 3 hrs curling her hair. It was sooo cool. She looked JUST like Bad Sandy. I wasn't really trying 2 be anyone, but when I arrived Ash went "Ahhh, Beth's Bad Sandy! Cool!" So I suppose that's what I was :D hehe. B4 I left 4 the party I asked mi Dad and younger brother Michael what era I was from. Dad replied "The 90's" and Michael replied "Texas" Hehe. Silly silly people. And 4 some strange reason, Mum thought TIM HUGHES was coming to the party!! She only just found out who he was the other day and she seems 2 think he is part of the group, no matter what I tell her!! Haha. So neway...the party was really fun! Ash really loved our pressie which was great! I spent a lot of the time with Rach sitting on the couch being lazy and watching people play the iToy thing or wateva it is, where u try and hit things on the screen by waving ur arms in the air. Quite amusing actually. It was warm in there. And everyone wanted us 2 come out, ditch the boys, and hang with the girls. We eventually succumbed 2 temptation.I felt like being more social. So I forced miself into the cold, where we sat around in the garage talking with a bunch o people. Monty was showing his more "feminine" side by wearing Nat's pink satin dressing gown and prancing around like a girl. Luke ended up sitting on his lap, and Ash on mine. I once again discovered Monty's "wandering hand" slowly moving from mi shoulder down, and the same 4 Ash. Gosh that guy is cheeky. He was even trying 2 rub my leg at one time. And rub my head.Haha. He eventually stopped. A slap or so from me and a few evil glares from Luke did the trick. hehe. So apart from all those shenanigans the party was quite fun. Some funny conversation with some funny people. The hints from various people who will not be named 2 go and "sit on Luke's lap!!" were laughed off, as per usual.(come on as if I would do that in front of everyone! :P) I was reluctant 2 leave once the party was over, because I was having heaps o fun, but at least I had Ash's after-party 2 look forward 2!! Yay! Monty tried 2 sneak in the car. He wanted 2 join in the "girls pamper night" Girls only. But we thought he was close enough 2 join us. Hehe. So neway, we were all carpooled back 2 Ash's house. When we got there she showed us her pamper table. It was soo cool! First, we got foot scrub and put it all over our feet, then we tookin turns putting our feet into the foot spa. Then we massaged eachothers feet with mango stuff, then painted the toenails. Next up we had our face masks, mud masks and cucumbers, and we let them dry while we watched 'Grease' and sang along 2 all the songs. Then we did our nails, with hand massages, buffing, polishing, filing and doing French Manicures. And we had massage lines, using various things such as our hands, those little plastic octopus massages and the bead massages. It was a total girls pamper night! Then we had dinner (Tacos) and watched '50 First Dates'. Nat and I were the only ones who hadn't seen it! We just fitted all that in b4 most of the girls had 2 leave. So only the people who were sleeping over were left. Which was Megan, Steph D, Mel, Ash (obviously) and me! We got our mattresses set up and watched 'In America' while eating chokkie and drinking OJ. It was a totally sweet movie! :D That finished at about 2am. Then we talked 4 about 2 hrs!! Hehe. Lots of girly stuff mentioned here, from bitchiness 2 guys. I got a lot of, lets just say "advice" on my love life. Haha. And Mel was embaressing Hayley by saying "Hey, Hayley, y'know, u and Andrew, ay?" And we were all saying that Ash should have kissed Tim because she was "16 and Never been kissed" and also because the knife from the cake was dirty and she had 2 kiss the closest boy, but she wouldn't!! At the party, we were all chanting "Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!" hehe. Didn't work though. Monty was jealous, he wanted the kiss. We evetually settled off around 4am, after Mel was screaming at us 2 shutup numerous times! We had a sum total of 4 and half hours sleep! Argh! We were awoken bi Ash's mum clanging pots and pans, and then becsuse it was Mel's b'day, she was served brekkie in bed, with a pile of pancakes with maple syrup on the top and a scoop of icecream, topped off with a candle and a birthday song! Yay! And I then got driven home. Ash and I consumed the rest of the chocolate in the morning, much 2 Mel's disgust!! SO yeh that was mi fun day and a half. Bloggin off, Beth      Grease is the word.....
