But these aren't your typical mermaids, anchors, and "MOM"s--they're designs from paintings by Picasso.  Mom and Dad remember him as a mild-mannered musician, gentle --kind of like Clark Kent with a trombone. They were horrified when I told them about Pat's recent body modifications. To them, tattooing means ill-advised, permanent, inescapable self-disfiguration. But as an English major, I can't think of tattooes without thinking of Ray Bradbury's  urlLink The Illustrated Man  and Flannery O'Connor's almost perfect  urlLink short story , "Parker's Back."
