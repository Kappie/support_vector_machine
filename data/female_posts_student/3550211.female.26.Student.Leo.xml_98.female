However, I think Kerry made a very strategic move by picking Edwards as his running mate. Even though Edwards only won one primary, if I remember correctly, he was very well liked by many voters. Not to mention, the southern states. This will  definitely  help Kerry win over the southern states. Personally, I like Edwards. More importantly, I TRUST Edwards. Why? I have no idea. Don't get me wrong, I trust  all  politicians about as far as I could throw one of them, but nonetheless, I trust him more then I trust Kerry. Does this mean I will vote for Kerry now? I have no idea. But now I'm definitely at least  considering  it! Good move on Kerry's part -indeed.
