Feel lousy if you forgot, cause here I am in Israel all alone with my bones, and I only got birthday wishes from one person in the whole world.   (okay, I'm bitter cause I'm a huge birthday person and spending bdays alone in various countries away from family/friends stinks, and I know that there's an 8 hour time difference and maybe tomorrow when I check my email I'll have birthday wishes in my inbox, but still...)
