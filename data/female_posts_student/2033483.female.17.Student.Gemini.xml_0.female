(You survived the parking lot I can see if you are reading this)  Also, Mr. Powers asked how I was and I said good and he's like I like it when your in a good mood and are smiling.  Compliments are awesome!  Everyone should give them and get them.  Off to Algebra, but not without first stopping to talk with Lizzie and getting asked for gum by Kurt.  Maybe I should just give the kid a pack of gum?  But anywho...Mrs. Wettlaufaur had her baby so we now have a sub til Christmas vacation (fyi: I don't know if that's how you spell her name, isn't that bad?)  Oh, and Mrs. Newitt had to go and mix things up on me and give us a new seating arrangement.  GRRR!  I don't like change how many times do I have to go through this?  But I did get 100% on my quiz so kudos to that!  Lit and Comp was so dumb.  Sorry to break it to you Mrs. Benz but Pres. Bush didn't write that speech, his speech writer did, so maybe you should tell him how good it is.  Lunch was interesting.  I'll explain farther on.  Chemistry was good, I did very well on my test as predicted.  I was so thrilled that time ran out in AP History b/c I didn't want to present my court case without my partner.  Newspaper was interesting.  I feel I must say that RHS has become a sex crazed school.  I'll explain.  A person who I won't name cuz I don't know if that is right but "The Pill" fell out of her purse for the entire study hall to see.  Then on my way back from the bathroom I was reading the board above the drinking fountains and someone put a boobie mobile cartoon up.  Granted it was funny, but wrong and after enough ppl read it Mr. Powers decided to see what all the commotion was about and took it down.  Then, when Renae and I were roaming the halls working on the photo survey, this freshmen came up to us and asked if that was a condom on the floor and we said no that was a piece of paper and she's like no there and Whoa... It was.  People, control yourselves!    Lizzie and I are going to the play tonight!  FUN TIMES!  I can't wait, I've heard so many good things about it!  tata
