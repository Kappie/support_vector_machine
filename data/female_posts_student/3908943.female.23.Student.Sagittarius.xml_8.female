After that we went to his friends bar because it was his birthday.  We didn't get back till late, but it was good times.  Saturday we took his mom and his aunt to a Cubs game at Wrigley Field.  We dropped them off and then went to this little hotdog stand that we went to last year on one of my first trips that he took me to Chicago.  Then during the game we wondered around Wrigleyville.  Afterwards we went to a Mexican restaurant with them.  By this time I was tired so I decided that driving back late wouldn't be the best thing.  I left there the same time his brother was taking him to the airport to head for Boston this morning.  I know he'll be busy, but will have a great time out there at the Convention.  This is what he wants to do with his life and why he's going to school since Politics is his major.  But I admit, I'm going to really miss him and can't wait till he gets back.    I briefly thought about stopping in Bloomington on my way back home since there is a MIG meeting at Illinois Wesleyan.  But, I was passing by way too early and am still tired from the weekend, so I decided to just head home.  I've logged about 2000 miles in one week.  And I'm sure within the next week or two I'll be on the road again since I like to roadtrip so much.  :-)
