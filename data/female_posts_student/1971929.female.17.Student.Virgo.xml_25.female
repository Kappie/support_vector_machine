Last night, well, early this morning, at like 1 I took my sister Rachel, her "best friend" as I am told to refer to her as, Sarah, and a guy named Ross (who is friend to all of us) house wrapping. It was Rachel and Sarah's first time house wrapping. It was hysterical to watch fifteen-year-old Rachel stand there mumbling to herself about how she felt "so bad". Oh, I needed that. Ross is hilarious. Rachel and Sarah are really lucky he was there because they would have been complete failures on their own. I drove, since the two girls are 15 and Ross's license is suspended for 6 months after running into a guardrail and 80 mph and into a ditch. We parked sort of across the street at some Baptist Church/School and Ross went to check the house out because Rachel was paranoid that we were going to get caught. After he told us the coast was clear and they grabbed the toilet paper they went across the street and began the wrapping. I later joined them, but only as Supervisor, and I told them where to go and what to wrap. It was so funny watching Rachel and Sarah in all their confusion. When we ran out of toilet paper we tried to go back across the street and take off before we got caught, but a car came so we took off back to the house and hid. Then we tried to cross again, but another car came and we had to hide again. Once more we tried and again a car came. There must have been like 5 cars. When we finally got across and to the car Rachel remembered she left the flashlight. Who brings a flashlight house wrapping? Moron. So we went back and Rachel and Sarah hopped out of the car the search for the lost flashlight while Ross and I drove around the block trying not to look suspicious. Ross is a really cool guy.
