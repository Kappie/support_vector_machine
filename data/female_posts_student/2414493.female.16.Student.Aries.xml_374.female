As much as I hate to admit it, Nigel's theory that the ugly and pretty stick to themselves in their own respective groups is holding pretty true. I don't think I can ever feel as secure as I do when I'm home because I don't know a good amount of people, and unconsciously too much time is devoted to estimating what other people think of me, or how they judge me depending on what I'm wearing or what I'm doing, etc. (ew, she has a Cal sweatshirt on...).  I think part of the insecurity is from belonging, if I may, to a temporary coterie. As the people around you settle down and grow complacent and become weirder and weirder (read: Matt) you sometimes wonder if you're in the right situation. Or if you can branch out and find some other people. It's not dissatisfaction, no, or maybe it's simply denial, and I'm comfortable the way I am, but it's always that road not taken complex.  The more I see of people, the more I form some model of an ideal person. Sometimes you see a person and try to gauge in a shallow way whether or not they fit those specifications, though deep down one can never really know.  Lydia's perception of an ideal person?  More than anything, the person has to be reasonably intelligent and put it to good use. The smarter the better, though there's a catch: no dorks. They have to be involved and do well in those areas. They have to be reasonably attractive, or at least ok to look at--I'm not being superficial, but if you were applying for a job interview and A and B were the same in stats except B was ugly, you tell me who's going to be picked for the job. They have to be approachable, a leader, one always with a smile. They have to want something, and something reasonable, and have a plan for it. They have to know how to communicate--I guess that goes along with leadership. They just have to sparkle and at least have some respectable friends. You must think I'm crazy now, but you know what I'm talking about--there are just some people that move in a crowd. Someone you can completely respect and actually like.  Maybe it's better not put in words. It's just gut feeling. I don't know how rational it is to try to be that kind of person...but the impression I get is that there are quite a few of these types here at Harvard, even more so during the regular year.  But you know, perhaps idolatry is simply sheer madness.  There's too many people walking around with Harvard paraphernalia on, so much so that I'm almost embarrassed to wear my own Harvard sweatshirt out. So I'm sticking with Cal. Go bears. I wonder how much truth was held in Grandma's statement when she said, "What? You want to go to Harvard for a summer just to go there once?" as if she was hinting that I wasn't going to get in for the regular year. I'm usually not so picky about college gear since I'm guilty of possessing it myself, but for some reason I'm sensitive to this Harvard thing.  I'm just retarded. Why do I try to fit everyone to my ideals? What good does that do me, the world? Don't listen to me, really.  I did better on my response paper than I thought I would.  Opinions should be handled carefully. On one extreme is Matt, who posts up "Screw Kerry, Go Bush!" signs on the Pennypacker doors even though I haven't heard him argue any political policy and I only know he's a die-hard conservative, but that doesn't do much for my respect for him. It's sad to know that he's going to vote in the next presidential election. I hope there isn't a whole brigade of hicks out there like that who blindly vote on political issues without educating themselves. I really hate him. There's the Asian fetish thing, saying just about the stupidest things ever to escape from a human mouth, flinging food across the table, the pickup lines...just being a general asshole. And he keeps on apologizing and then committing the same offenses again.   And then you'll have some conversations in a lifetime (many, actually) when nobody cares what you're going to do. "When do you guys want to go?" "Doesn't matter." I guess that's when it's appropriate to take a stand, but then you're afraid of turning Nazi.  They tore the newspaper off the walls of 16. Boo hoo.  I better start reading the course pack.
