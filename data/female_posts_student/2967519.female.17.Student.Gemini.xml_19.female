Im already in a bad mood b/c i have to get stuck with needles and then she tells me that i need to have someone moniter my heart! So im freaking out wondering whats going to happend tomorrow. When we were done with all of that we had to go to cell one b/c Liz's cell bill was WAY out there and ended up there for almost 2 hours! It was so borring. I have alot of stuff to do tomorrow so i prolly wont get around to updating till thursday or friday. I leave on Sunday, I dont like planes or being crammed in like a pack of sardines. anyways still gotta do it no matter how much i hate it. byebye
