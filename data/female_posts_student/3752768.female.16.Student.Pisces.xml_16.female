Today Eka and I went to Calzones to tell them I got a differant job. The manager was upset (not in a bad way.) and I told him that Eka was looking for a job and so they hired Eka at Calzones. So now we are all employed.     Ryan came over and we watched T.v. and went out to eat. It was nice...OMG! ony 3 days til our 1 year!!!     Well Iam out!
