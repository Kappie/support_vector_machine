And, if they do want to, I guess I just wish they'd take two minutes to call and ask me themselves if I'm busy. I haven't seen them that much for the past few months but that was due in large part to the fact that I was working. They know I'm not working anymore so I have some free time for a bit. Whatever. I guess I just needed to vent. I don't think they're doing that on purpose. I love them and they're great friends. I guess I was just a little hurt. Oh well. I'm going to sleep.
