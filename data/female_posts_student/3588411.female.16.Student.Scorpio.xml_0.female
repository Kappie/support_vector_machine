I got to touch a sting ray.They are actually very friendly and came right up to the side of the tank. They feel like ...um...a pussy....The shark ride (train ride) was superdeduperly corny.  It was a big mechanical shark popping out of the water.  I couldn't help but think about that movie A.I (Artificial Intelligence)and how Manhattan was all underwater and if that happened here in houston all the little fishes and stuff would get out and the aqaurium would look so freakin creepy to "scuba divers".  And if you were to pass by the corny train ride shark you'd crap yur pants thinking this huge mechanical head is a huge ass shark.  Actually to think about that happening to a person is kind of funny...
