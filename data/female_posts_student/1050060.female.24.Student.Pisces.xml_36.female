I have an hour and a half to kill. So i decided to write on my blog since i didn't write anything since Sept 4th. On Friday September 5th i went to my french class which was level 2. As everyone who is close to me knows i speak french very well. I took a lower level course because i have to practice my french writting. Maybe i should take a English course for my english writting too..lol.   Anyways the teacher told me that i needed to go into a higher level course. So she told me to leave. Can you beileve that i was kicked out of class because i was too good for the course. So i told my mom on the phone the other night that i was kicked out of the class. She said " WHAT ?" So i laughed and told her why. I think she though i got into trouble.   Today will be the first day in which i will be going to my Death and Dying course. Some people have told me that it was a good course. I will just have to wait and see. So now i am just wanting for Brandi to finish class so we can go to the death and dying course. Oh Brandi and i are taking the course together.  Classes today went well. I realized that i need to read up on Canadian political science again. I forgot a lot of it since 1999. There was a lot of stuff Heather said that i remember but there is a lot that i forgot.   Student loans are  STILL  not in. I am a little pissed with them about it. I still don't have any money for books. Books are going to cost about $600 dollars.  $600!!!!   Can you believe that! it just plain nuts. This girl that i met today said her friend is paying $129 per book and she has 7 to buy. You do the math. So i realized that i was crazy to come back to university. Oh well it better be good and i get a great paying job after all this crap.   Well i never seen any of my old friends but thats because they have finished and graduated last year. It would have been great to see them again. Oh well sometimes you can't keep in touch with everyone. I met a few nice people so far. Also i met some people that are not on the same level as me. I feel that i am getting old even if i am only 23. There is just so many youths. Most of them are not even the age to drink or buy smokes. So i try to stay away from those groups. Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with them. But i don't want to be at a party with a bunch of people who under age. Thats just not right.  Maybe its because i have worked with youth from 15 to 18. They were my friends but again they are not on the same level as me. Do you understand what i am trying to say?  Well i am going to get going. I am just saying stuff so i wouldn't be so bored. Anyways have a good day! Miss you all!
