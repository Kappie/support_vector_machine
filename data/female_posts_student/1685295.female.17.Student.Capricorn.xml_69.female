First of all lets discuss the new console that is coming out sometime, they don't really tell you when. All they tell you is that you can register to reserve one when it does come out. For all those who don't know what I am talking about, I would like to introduce you to the  urlLink The Phantom . It looks really great. Maybe that is the problem, that it looks too good to be true. It's supposed to be easy to install, fast ("up to 3Ghz") and even wireless LAN built in. You're supposed to be able to play games with anyone over a wireless network. The funny shit is that there aren't any CDs or cartridges. The games are supposed to be online, and you can rent and download over the game's huge network. Last time someone tried to do this (that crap ass hand-held with 132 games built in) it sucked huge cock. Then there is the fact that you have to download the game, and that will take a while to download the game, even on a cable connection (hell it took me three hours to download the Unreal Tournament III Demo). Then there is the fact that wireless connections suck, they are slower than the norm and they tend to break off during bad weather connections.  The Phantom seems too good to be true, the only way it could seem better is if came with a helper monkey to turn the system on while you are sitting on the couch.  The video card that the Phantom will use isn't top of the line though, it will use the GeForce FX. On the other hand Microsoft is developing X-Box 2, which will have the Raedon built in. So instead of registering for some too good to be pixy gold crap, you could just wait for the new X-Box. Secondly and lastly I would like to say that everyone should buy/borrow/download/steal the new  urlLink Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic . It got really good reviews and the graphics look awesome (white trash word of the day).
