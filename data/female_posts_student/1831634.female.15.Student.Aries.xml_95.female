And of course the L/J fic of doom.  3) Draw fanart: a bit too much, I think.  (but nothing of quality...)  4) Review much: not really.  5) Read too many fics: Moderate, I think.  6) Favorite house: Gryffindor.  (Harry, Herm, Lily, James, Sirius, Remus... what's to hate??)  7) Favorite Gryffindor student: Lily.  =D  Then James/Harry (tie), then Sirius, then Herm, then... yeah.  8) Favorite Slytherin student: Like, Millicent, DUH!  9) Favorite Ravenclaw student: Luna.   10) Favorite Hufflepuff student: Huffys don't really register in my mind...  11) Favorite teacher: I   12) Favorite overall character: Harry.   13) Favorite adult: Remus.  (closely followed by McGonagall.  then Dumbledore.)  14) Canon/fanon Draco: Canon.  Fanon's more fun, though.  15) Canon/fanon Snape: Canon.  16) Voldemort or Dumbledore: Dumbledore.  17) Cho, annoying or not: YES.  GET AWAY FROM HARRY.  Shipping:  18) Your OTP: HARRY/HERMIONE, DUH.  And L/J, but they've already happened.  I LOVE HARRY/HERMIONE.  IF HERMIONE ENDS UP WITH RON I WILL JILT CANON AND JUST LIVE IN FANON.  19) Other ships you sail: Fred/Angelina, H/D, D/Hr, D/G, G/Seamus, G/Neville, G/Colin, R/L, S/Arabella, S/L, McGonagall/Dumbledore, R/Squid.  =D  20) Intriguing ships: H/D, D/Hr, D/G.  (Draco seems to be very intriguing.)  21) Underimpressive ships to me: Snape/H.  (Snarry... LOL.)  Snape/Hr.  22) Hated ships: HARRY/GINNY.  RON/HERMIONE.  23) Het, slash or femmeslash: Het.  Slash or femmeslash if they're good.  24) H/Hr or R/Hr: H/Hr.  Sadly, canon is so tilted toward R/Hr that it's amazing it's not upside-down yet.  25) D/Hr or D/G: D/G.  Cute.  26) H/D or H/SS: H/D.  27) Older gen, younger gen or cross-gen: Just not cross-gen.  Fanfiction: (no more shipping..?  **tear)  28) Canon or AU: Well-written.  Not totally AU, though.  Like Harry = sex addict doesn't work for me.  29) Fluff or angst: Neither.  If a one-shot, probably would read the fluff, unless the angst has SOME sunlight in it.  No deathfic.  30) Darkfic: As long as no deathfic.  31) OOC or IC: IC.  Duh.  32) SuddenlyVeryPowerful!Harry: Unless it's Mage!Harry from PoU, no thanks.  33) One-shot or chaptered: Chaptered.  But finished chaptered.  Good one-shots.  34) Novel-length:   35) Gen, het or slash: Gen or het.  Extremely well written slash.  36) Drabbles: Doesn't satisfy.  37) SuddenlyVerySexy!Draco: *hysterics*  38) Fanfiction Pet Peeves: OOC. Bad grammar.  No commas.  No paragraphs.  No voice.  Lack of complex-sentences.  No character development.  No plot development.  No plot, period.  Ignoring parts of canon.  AKA 99.9% of HP fics out there.  39) Canon or Fanon: both.  40) Many ships in one fic: Yes.  Books:  (dunno what happened to 41-58...)  59) Cried for Cedric: No.  60) Cried for Sirius: No. I felt horrible for Harry, though, and I did almost want to cry when he smashed the mirror.  61) Dark or Light Side: Light.   62) Did the explanation of the prophecy satisfy you: No.  63) Which character(s) needs some more development: Lily and James.  Fanart:  64) Favorite artist(s): Me!  No, not really.  Yethro, definitely.  Don't know that many American HP artists.  65) Favorite drawing style: Personally, half-realistic half-cartoon/anime.  But that's just what's easiest for me.  Am leaning more toward realistic, I think.  I can't draw a full anime character for you anymore, at any rate.  Like, thin neck big eyes small body big head... no.  66) Love fanart of: MWPP, Trio, H/Hr, L/J.  67) Fanart Pet Peeves: uhh... ugly art?  68) Stick art: Unless super-cute, generally ick.  69) Shiny: I like shiny things...  but not really that shiny type of CG.  Looks fake.  70) Anime/Manga style: it's cute.  71) Realism:   72) Cartoon: Not really into American cartoon drawing style.  73) Gen or shipped: both.  Misc.:  74) Blaise's gender: -________-  what about transvestite?  75) Tom Riddle's eye colour: Prussian blue.  =D  76) Luna fan: Love Luna.  77) OC's, done or not done: Generally, not.  78) Liking Weasley ships with 'Flame' or 'Fire' in the name: Not really...  79) Weasley love:   80) Malfoy love: Why not.  81) Potter love:   82) Is Lucius really 49: o__0.  83) Brilliant ship name (Don't need to ship it, though!): I think the one that most made me laugh was LARDASS: 'Lavender and Ron Deserve a Shot Shippers'. :D HMS Cliche for Snape/Lily was amusing, too.  (this was someone else's answer... but I like it.  =D)  84) Plain stupid ship name: Good Ship.  God.  Orange Crush, too.  (Pumpkin Pie is pretty stupid, too, but hey, not about to bash my own ship.)  85) Voldemort. Bald. Yes or no: Huh?  86) The power He-Knows-Not and the power that saved Harry is: Love, friendship.  87) Your view on Hufflepuff-ies: Scram.  88) Should Ron say 'Bloody Brilliant' more then once? What the crap?  89) Hermione. Pretty. Am I right?: Yes, but not in the Emma Watson way.  More subdued.  90) Best HP fanfic ever: PoU.  91) Rec the 2nd best, too: Liked Come Together (though unfinished...), Crossroads, and I'm sure lots of other fics that I've forgotten.  92) Did HP change your life dramatically: Ooooh yeah.  93) Marauders. Like or dislike:   94) Prongs, Moony, Padfoot or Wormtail: MWPP preferred, but James.  =DDDD  95) Could Lily have been an animagus too: A bit too neat of a package if she was, so no.  96) What animal Lily would've been: Something like Hedwig.  97) Did Harry pass his Potions' O.W.L.s: No, but it'll all sort out... because he's Harry Potter, of course.  98) Did Ron: Don't really care.  99) Is Harry going to die or will he survive: Live.  100) What gives you the most warm fuzzies in your stomach in the whole HP-verse: That last scene in SS.  Where he wins the House Cup for Gryffindor.
