Our church is so rich that they have all those huge inflatable bouncy things. They also have all free food and such. I love our church.  My mom is obbsessed with volunteering [and so am I!! Hence the carrot! (inside joke. Haha.)] she volunteered everyone in my family to help! It shall be fun though. I get to be in charge of one of the inflatables. mwa haha. I hope I get to bounce on it!! Those things rock. So I get to play with little kids all day!! Yay!!!! I hope none of them get hurt....I will feel quite guilty.  ANDDD.....  Later today.....   MANDY IS COMING!!!!  I haven't seen her since spring break which is quite quite sad. They have already been in the car for like 7 hours!!!! Cuh-razy!!!  Last night Hannah and I made her a welcome poster. Haha. Well, acctually, Hannah made it! She is SO artistic. I wrote the word "MANDY" and it looks SO bad. Haha. Then the part she did is like gorgeous. Haha. It's a pretty sue-wheat poster. You all will have to see it when you come on Monday. [well..not all of you..but yeah...]  I can't wait till Mandy comes!!  According to MapQuest it should take 11 hours 14 minutes.  That means they should be here at like 5!!! Woohoo!!  Maybe I can get my mom to let us all go to Pizza Schmizza. So good!!  A couple days ago we were just driving around and there were all those political signs everywhere and I saw this one sign and it said "Elect Schmizza For Dinner!" It was SOOO fun-knee!!!  I better go, talk to you all later!!!!  Love, laura Fantora
