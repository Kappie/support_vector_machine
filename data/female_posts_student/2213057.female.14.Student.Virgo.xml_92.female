"good. do you want some money?" my mom (so cruel)  "ahhhhhhhhhhh" *crying* *crying* "i hate you!" my sister  "well then, you better get going." my still unloving mother.  *absolutely quiet*  "mom... i can't find my duffel bag. do i have to go?" my quiet little sister.   "no, i guess you can stay" mom.  "alrighty then, can we go grocery shopping now?" me; confused.  my family is so meesed up. you know what? i'm glad i'm not addicted to anything bad for me, and i'm glad i'm not really fat (well i am a bit, but i'm talking SUMO here) or really skinny or sucidal. and i'm really frickin glad i have a family. damn am i glad for that. even if they're all retarded in a loveable way. well, tetris calls (and so should you for my answering machine!). so, in deep love, i part, to my tetris, then to my bed that is currently covered in laundry i have to fold. longest blog for a while, eh? see what boredom does... GAH!!!! sleep+tetris await. later, bekah *a kiss and a hug!* (if you have a slave or man/woman whore who do all your bidding, get a massage too)
