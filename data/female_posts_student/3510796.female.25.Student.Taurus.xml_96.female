Believed  to  have  originated  in  India  in ancient times      before first ravaging the Roman world as early as A.D. 165,      since  then  it  [smallpox]  had  scourged humanity in what      amounted to a permanent pandemic, causing incalculable loss      of life and misery through morbidity and disfigurement.      --Frank Ryan, M.D., [1]Virus X       Within  a  decade,  half  a  million  had  perished. Nobody      guessed that such a rare disease would become a pandemic.      --Steve Jones, [2]Darwin's Ghost       TV,  in  particular,  spreads the common culture to the far      corners  of the world; it is a kind of global pandemic, but      it  spreads  at  a  speed  that  makes  the old plagues and      pandemics unbearably slow.      --Lawrence M. Friedman, [3]The Horizontal Society
