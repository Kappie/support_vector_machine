Canada is THE BESTEST country out there. yeah. all i can say is "happy birthday to the best damn country out there!!" oh yes. Canada is #1. the best, the beautifullest, the calmest, the... the.... well im speechless. the list is endless. this country rocks. yeah. last night when we were driving home i saw that they put the Canada Flag back up in front of the car dealership and hotel by guildford mall. it made my heart happy. hehehe  anyways. last night i went with the soongs and vanessa and kayel down to robson. we walked along robson for a bit browsing some of the [freakin expensive] shops. when in Buffalo, i found a pink sleeveless top that i fell in love with immediately. since everything in the store was 50% off, i decided that i must have the shirt. the total came to under $15. yup. i say it was a good buy. i had to wait in line at the cashier for like 10-15 minutes though. argh i think they needa get a second cash register in that store. oh well. after that, we went to eat at some chinese restaurant. yup yup! after that, mrs. soong wanted to rent some movies, so they rented "my baby's daddy" and "cheaper by the dozen" i wanted to watch "cheaper by the dozen" but we ended up watching "my baby's daddy" first. it was arite. nothing special. not that funny, but it had its decently funny points. oh well. after that we were going to watch "cheaper by the dozen" but daniel and vanessa were watching it downstairs. oh well. then i went home. and read a book. until 1:30. and then i woke up like 45 minutes ago. and now im here. again. like usual. wasting my summer away. i should eat. or something. i dont know what to do. i have nothing to say. i... i... argh. im bored!
