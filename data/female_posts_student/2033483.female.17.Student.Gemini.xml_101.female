She's right, in nine days the class of 2005 will all come together again, for the last time to buy our parking tags, buy our activities sticker, take our ID pictures, and grab our final schedules. This momentous occasion will take twenty minutes if one gets there before the rush, and I too wonder how such a final moment in our lives can possibly be given it's proper good-bye in such a short time span.    Ten months from now, on May 29th at 3 p.m. our class will come together for the last time at graduation. Where we will walk across the stage to receive our diploma. A piece of paper that signifies hard work, achievements, disappointments, and the end. In those ten months many things will happen to us. We'll decide our futures, finalize our pasts, and live in the moment. At the end of this month on August 30th, we officially take rein as the Senior Class of 2005. I hope, as I walk into the school for the last first time, I stop to take a moment to take it all in. I wish you would do the same. This year is going to be hectic and challenging, but always take moments to step back and appreciate what's there.   I love you, Kayla
