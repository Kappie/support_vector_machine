I was very skeptical at first but then I said "what the hell, i'll try it...if they don't pay me i'll just remove the links".  So far, so good.  They just deposited the money in my paypal account.   Anyways..they said they'll give me a referal fee if I refer anyone to them..  So if anyone out there is reading this and ur interested, let me know..  ~Bunz
