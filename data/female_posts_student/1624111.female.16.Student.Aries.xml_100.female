"we'll see." dont know if thats more of a maybe or a no. but, hey, it is on the way home from lauries. (and why is laurie so special? no...dont want to ask that...probably no reason. im just paranoid.) so that could be a nice break from homework. im hoping for it, though i dont know how likely it is.   i ordered girl scout cookies from heather today. apparently all together my family has ordered 15 boxes. 15! seems like a lot. i guess theyll go quickly, though. have ordered from heather, michele, and my moms pto friend's daughter. irked me when michele said something innocently enough but with an impied statement of "you only bought cookies from heather last year, dont forget im selling them too. youre my friend too. my neighbor too. its not fair." blah blah blah... of course shes not that mean, but i know she meant to make me feel guilty or something. in an innocent sort of way. bah! human interaction. crazy. reminds me of that thing on julies profile:  Why do we speak in songs?  she asked, and my only response was to shrug and remind her that often it is easier to take words from others, let others speak that which is in our hearts.  But who is willing to bend his emotions to those of someone else? she asked.  All of us and none of us, I said.  We wish for people to read between the lines.  Subtext, she exclaimed.  In a way, I said.  Those who care about you are supposed to know what's written on your heart.  interesting, no? [sadness alert] mmm, but... what if, try as you may, you dont know everything about those you care about? and its hard to read their heart? not for lack of trying... sigh. i wish i was better at knowing what people really mean when they say things. or what they really mean when they do things. what they truly feel and think. and ive taken to just asking sometimes. but hten i get "i dunnos" which is bad cause, hell, what else am i supposed to do if you wont tell me and i cant figure it out myself? but then again, maybe im just trying to read into things too much and theres really nothing of any significance thought and felt but unsaid. in which case we can just conclude that i worry too much and should calm down and enjoy life and what happiness it gives me instead of making myself unhappy thinking about the happiness it wont give me and how much i want it. or something. i dont know. you can word that differently so that it sounds like either side is a good option. i could say what i just said, which makes it sound like im crazy for killing myself over something i should just forget about. or i could something to the effect of its crazy for me to give up and stop trying to acheive something i want so much, so...passionately, because just the fact that i want to keep trying is worth something, and i know i could give up and make life easier, but i dont want to because its so important to me, and isnt that sort of honorable? to sacrifice happiness for...ideals? sort of? or something? you know what i mean? yeah. i know exactly what i mean...  "Big Balls" by ACDC is a good song. funny. now thats one long double entendre.  i think ive decided for certain that im not goign to turnabout. for myriad reasons. and there is, in fact, heatherandmichele weirdness as i suspected there would be. which, before anything else, makes me feel bad for emily. who shouldnt have to deal with that. emily who just wanted people to go with her and eric to turnabout. maybe it wont be a big deal and no one will get mad or anything. thatd be nice. but thast one of the reasons i didnt want to go. i dont want to deal with that. because even if it doesnt bother emily, itd bother me. me who worries too much.       and then there are a million other reasons why i dont want to go. well, as i told martha who is/has been bothering me about this. (and is a (if not  the ) source of the michele problems...which annoys me)  martha:  kara:  just because she doesn't have a date doesn't mean she can't come...we can just have some extras...a lot of groups have that me: i know that. i just...the reasons for going arent tipping the scale when i try to weigh them with the reasons for not going martha: :-( me: and this michele thing...doesnt motivate me. Martha: what would motivate u?? me: i dont know me: if i had a guy i wanted to go with...who wanted to go wtih me... and if i would get to talk to emily lots without awkward eric-ness... and if i didnt have to deal with anit-michele (and heather) weirdness... and if i didnt have to dislike any band friends...and if caitlin was going... and if jessica was going... and if i had a dress i wanted to wear...and... if all the guys we were going with got along well... and... i dont know. stuff. me: probably more. Martha: ya me: if you can solve all of those problems for me, id probably go. me: but good luck with that.  those are some of the reasons i dont want to go. yes, some of them are vague. some actually less vague than i originally intented them to be. but thats why i dont want to go in a nutshell. two main reasons: 1. no guy. 2. although i may see emily, i dont think it will be a comforting "yay, we ARE good and happy friends! why do i worry?" kind of thing. i fear it may be the reverse, which is to be avoided at all costs if i value my sanity. and maybe that makes me a coward or means im avoiding the problem, or something. but oh well. maybe it means nothign and there is no problem and im just worrying too much. maybe thats it!  or maybe im crazy and paranoid and need medication or something. always a possibility...  though ive always thought i wouldnt want medication if they gave me medication to make me sane. i dont trust people screwing with my thoughts and my emotions and my reality. its all i have that no one can take away from me. and its all that is me, really. they cant mess with who i am. never.  mm, arguing morality with martha again. reminicent of the "love" conversation. mmm, never should have started that one... although... all this anti-michele business from the girl who said money can buy love. i dont get her. shes a good kid, i know it...but...i just dont completely get her. i wonder if i still get emily? mmm, i hope so. maybe i can again.  i tried making an omlette for breakfast/lunch. it came out kinda badly. tasted okay but it was a little too liquidy for my tastes. i always have that problem with omlettes...the inside part doestn cook all the way through. oh, and another problem i have is putting what physically are too many ingredients...though as far as taste goes, its usually dead on. crazy omlettles. my hand still smell like onions.  i think maybe ive been thinking too much today...maybe its a sign that i shouldnt give myself so much free time. though its good to think, right? sure...  ooh, now this conversation is deep. im probably making her sad and confused, actually. at least i hope im not. criticizing her philosophy on life...her lack of motivation for trying...and wondering if this is because she doesnt have a good reason for living...you know how everyone needs something to work towards to get up in the mroning? to make the bad days worth it? all taht....yeah... thats what were talking about now. depressing if youre just realizing these things and they shock you...which i dont think im doing to her, but...well, lets hope not. eh, i dont think i am. martha: u said the if u have nothing to work towards then ur life isnt fulfilling...so why does it have to be fulfilling??  sigh... some people i just dont get.   i feel like chinese food. i need to do my homework. i need to listen to some cool music. ive been blogging too long. i wish emily checked her email more often and actually sent me more email. that would make me happier. among other things. i wonder how it feels to know simple things like that...or just your actions in general affect another persons mood so profoudnly. i wonder if its overwhelming. i wonder if she even realizes it.  i decide today that i really want to be able to make people feel guilty. i want to know how to word things so delicately that they sound like an innocent comment but really they kindle a fire of guilt in the back of the mind...and then you drop little comments here and there...and the fire grows...and grows...and... maybe its cruel...it probably is. but sometimes i just want people to know how they should feel. like, dammit, that hurt, you dont feel guilty but you should! you know? ah, i dunno. i shouldnt wish things like this.  i wish...*closes eyes*... i wish...if you know me well at all, you know what i just wished for.  ha...and if you dont know me: its not a guy, its not money, its not my license, its not a grade, its not...anything matieral or stupid.  although...as someone wise once said, "i wish: for trivial things, i pray for everything else" or something like that. right? perhaps i shouldnt wish for something so important.  im going to get a cookie.  by the way, who all is reading my blog now? should i stop talking about emily? originally no one read this at all and i didnt talk about people or school...just...ideas. but now its more of a real blog for me. and apparently several people read it now...and jessica i dont care about so much cause she knows me and the people i tend to talk about well enough not to take anything the wrong way or anything. not that i dont trust my other friends who raed this, but... bah. i dunno. dont go crazy or think me insane over things i write. or think the people i write about are insane. or something. wow, i could have written this much more eloquently if i had more time and wasnt as distracted. oh well. basically: some of this is my private life you wouldnt normally hear about, i dont always freely tell anyone everything written on my heart, and maybe theres a reason for that. so keep that in mind while reading.
