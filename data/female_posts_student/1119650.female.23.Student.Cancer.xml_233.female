So far I've heard the following delightful muzak tunes in between the pertinent clips of DMV info (most of which tells me just to go to their  urlLink website ): Cruisin' - Hewey Lewis  Gwenyth Paltrow In My Life - The Beatles Sunny Came Home - Shawn Culvin Some unknown piece of turd about an "All Time High" Another unknown but equally sucky tune "This is how most ouf our ladies grew up at the country club, dancing." I think its great to see that we're in a budget crisis here in my state, but at least we've got snazzy assed tunes on the DMV phone holding system.  Apparently the woman wants me to know that my call is important to them.  Meh, so answer the fucking phone already
