Just for once I wish I could have a normal day.. My ideal day is not to much to ask... All I want is to smile all day and get along with every body but thats never gonna happen... I finished reading go ask alice yesterday it only took me a day to read.. but the bad thing is now I dont have another book to read!! any wayz.. I wanna make my profile more colorful and I wanna add pictures and music but I cant figure out how to... O-well I'll figure it out sooner or la8ter.. Wow Im wearing a skirt today.. and thats sorta weird for me because I Never WEre skirts.. Well I got to gO... ~*MEGZ*~
