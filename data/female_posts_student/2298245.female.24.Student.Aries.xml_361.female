Hmm...looking over  urlLink a list of his movies , it's almost difficult to understand what he means.  Okay, stepping off the sarcasm box (don't worry, it isn't you - I'm not any better at sarcasm in person), seriously, dude, nothing like stating the obvious.  That aside, I still love him.  And the interview is well worth a read.  Another highlight:   Q: And are your kids excited about you being in this film? A: Oh, they're thrilled. I'm a hero at school.   "This film" for those of you not in the know, refers to  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , which explains the link above.  Yes, I am an proud Potter fan and am very excited for the movie to come out.  Wanna make something of it?
