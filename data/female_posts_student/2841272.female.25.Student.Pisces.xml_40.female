I never saw the original   Walking Tall  , but I know that in 1973 it came out telling the true story of the crusading Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, and it was a southern phenomenon, kickstarting the "Southern" action genre.  This new theatrical remake makes some big changes to the template. Aside from being updated into current times, it has also been fictionalized(hero's name is Chris not Buford), moved to our own Kitsap County, and reconcieved as a vehicle for the fast-rising action superstar Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Not being the biggest fan of remakes, I think it was smart making these changes. So many times a remake is just a sloppy clone of the original that doesn't capture the magic of its predecessor.  In this version, the hero is an Army special forces vet who returns to his small hometown after many years, only to find the lumber mill closed and the main industry a gambling casino run by his slimy high school rival played by Neal McDonough. The villain tries to bring Chris into the corruption, but he resists and -- after a savage beating and mutilation by box-knife (the most feared weapon of our time) -- he is elected sheriff and goes after the crooks with everything he's got, including his favorite 2-by-4 club.  Granted, it s not exactly "Gone With the Wind" and will not be contending for Oscars, but it does have some bite. The script makes a compelling case that legalized gambling can have a devastating effect on a small community. In general, the performances are much better than they need to be for a popcorn movie like this. John Beasley is quietly touching as Chris' father, McDonough makes a splendidly detestable villian and Johnny Knoxville comes off well as the hero's comic relief and sidekick.
