When you do so, it gives you a headache only comforted by Outkast's Hey Ya...As Jessica puts it, it's America's guilty pleasure.  My favorite lines: "Shake it like a Polaroid picture!" "What's cooler than being cool?  Ice cold!" "Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor!" Anyway, I. won the Key club election.  BOO!  I can't stand him!  He's such a butt munchie!  You know, it would be cool if there was a candy called butt munchies.  It could be white chocolate and milk chocolate, with caramel in the middle for the stuff that comes out butts!  That would be soooo cool!  There could be white shapely female butts, then hairy male butts.  Bennifer butts!   Yea I think I've heard shake it like a polaroid picture like 15 times.  I've got Hey Ya on repeat.  There's this weird noise I just noticed in the chorus.  There's also this weird song on there called the morning after.  It sounds like Denzel, which is 'Tise's favorite actor.  I don't see it in these older actors.  Ashton - hot...Brad - hot...George Clooney and Denzel Washington - I just don't see it.  It's funny...both of them say their eyes are pretty.  I personally prefer Brad Pitt and Prince William, although a few of the guys at TD r hot...I'm not sayin who b/c lots of ppl at my school read this.  Well, my stomach is gurgling from the bad pizza I had, so I g2g.  Later.     You are a:  Hummingbird!  You like to make good grades and to excel at your hobbies. You are bummed when you don't do your best and when you can't get the nectar out of a flower.     urlLink   What's Your Animal Personality?    brought to you by quizilla.com
