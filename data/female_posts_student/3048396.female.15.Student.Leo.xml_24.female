It was scary...I just had all these weird pains and ugh it really sucked. My mom told me I still had to go to school so I pretty much made myself feel better and slowly got ready...but eh I still have those pains. Hurts like hell. For somereason I only feel it when I sit down...Odd. Anyways..school was just blah like normal. Spanish we worked on our scrapbooks...ugh I have to study that all weekend. I have to do good so I can get an A in that class. I need As to even out my Algebra grade. So yeah Science was pretty fun. We starting stuff on fire. Pretty cool. Mr. DeGroot almost blew his hand off tho. Everyone jumped...but it was cool. Very amusing. Homeroom was pretty boring...Ashley wasnt in there so I was stuck there with Derk n Logan. Logan was all blah (probably because Ashley wasnt there but yeah) So it was just...eh...then Algebra was just...grand. Eh. I hate it! Then Choir was just dumb...we're watching Drum Line since shes testing everyone so Tracy and I just sat there and drew on the bottom of my shoes..pretty fun...lol Band was gay we had just put everything away and went outside to sit when the lady came to sing America so we had to all go back in take everything back out and play. Eh it was pointless. I don't wanna go Monday but I have to. *sigh* Then we had a cheerleading meeting. Talked bout how we now have 8 on Varsity and now Jen and I wont just be alone Jessica is with us too. *Sigh* Hopefully if Erica and Sarah quit it'll still be Jen n I but who knows now...*sigh* Oh well...Atleast I had a dream for 2 days. So yeah...I really have nothing else to ramble about so I'll let cha go...  -Tara   Current Song:  The Reason by Hoobastank  Current Mood:  Content
