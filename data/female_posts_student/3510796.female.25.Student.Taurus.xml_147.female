And despite superstition and rumor, rates of crime, poor driving, dog bites, and childbirths will be about the same as any other night of the year. But some will see the phenomenon as cause for celebration. Colorado-based Coors Brewing Company, for example, plans to launch a promotion this July around their Blue Moon brand of Belgian-style wheat beer.      The beer was named at a 1995 branding meeting, when a marketer said, "Flavors like these are ones that come around once in a blue moon," according to Amy Valdez, a spokesperson for the company.    --------------------------    Word of the Day for Saturday July 31, 2004        megrim \MEE-grim\, noun:    1.

It's all in good fun though. Throwing a line out into open waters, sitting and watching a neon orange bobber go up and down in the waves, waiting for that chance to tug back when you see it go under water. Fishing. The life. My dads life. Lake, here we come.      peace.love.dmb.
