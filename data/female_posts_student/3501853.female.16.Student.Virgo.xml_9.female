I really did this time and I know I've cried wolf before and called for help in my life but this is one of the rare times that I really do need help that this is no cry wolf but I fucked up. I fucked up my life so fucking bad. Why don't I ever learn lessons and when I do learn a life lesson, I learn it too late and why do I always take for granted what I know is most precious to me, why did I fuck this up. All I know is...this is really the bottom of the depths right here: it's hard to breathe, the beating of my heart is louder than my mute voice and my pupils can't even be seen anymore from the tears...I'm living a life of a big regret, I fucked up one of the greatest things that ever happened to me and living this life of regret just makes me want to call quits on everything; suddenly, everything lost its importance...I'm walking but I'm invinsible,depressed,empty  dead inside...I'm here but I'm really not, what held me together is gone and it's my fault...I see my reflection in the mirror but it's not me, the mirror shows someone worthy of being here, what I am is the person I hate the most, the person who fucked up her life so fucking bad that it's not a life anymore, the person who took for granted everything and is alone, the person who is so fucking stubborn and so fucking blind that if she does learn a lesson and change it's too late, what my life is is dead and I wish I could just sleep for the rest of eternity. I've lost mostly everything I love and need and that that I did not lose I'm so afraid of fucking up. I don't want/need/care for my life anymore.
