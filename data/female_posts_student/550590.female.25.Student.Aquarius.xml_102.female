I don't kow if they ever figured out what was wrong with him, but he ate breakfast and apparently it was very exciting.  I'm getting ready to head home (yes, I'm blogging on the clock yet again) for a fun-filled weekend.  I'll be out and about most of the time, but you can always reach me on my cell.  Don't forget to RSVP for the 4th of July BBQ!!!
