"  I never said I'd lie and wait forever  If I did we'd be together  I can't always just forget her  But she could try   At the end of the world  Or the last thing I see  You are never coming home  never coming home  Can I  Should I  And all the things that you never ever told me  And all the smiles that are ever , ever...   Get the feeling that you'll never  All alone and I remember now  At the top of my lungs in my arms she dies  She dies   At the end of the world  Or the last thing I see  You are never coming home  Never coming home  Can I  Should I  And all the things that you never ever told me  And all that smiles that are ever gonna haunt me  Never coming home  Can I       Should I      And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me  For all the ghost that are never gonna catch me   If I fall  If I fall...      "    I think they should start.
