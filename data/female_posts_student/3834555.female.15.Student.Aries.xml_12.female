I am going to give y'all the low down on the most important people in my life and why!!! and if you arnt here i am really sorry, it's 11:23 pm and i am totally burned! tell me i forgot you and i'll add you!!   Lindsey Seven ~ Lindsey is my best girl friend in the whole freakin universe!!! we are like... mind linked! no, seriouly we are... just ask, we have some pretty freak stories we could tell ya! Lindsey was introduced to me by my dear Kasey last summer and we have just become best friends about 6 monthes ago... now, if you try to seperate us we will either kill you or the person standing next to you!! really, she left for Mexico for 11 days and i bout killed either myself or Kasey!! and i kept running into walls! Lindsey has been one of three people that have helped me with my walk with God too! just shows how much we need eachother!! I love you Lindseykins! you rock my sox and will FOR-EV-ER!!!   Kasey Bryant ~ Kasey is my bestest friend in the WHOLE world! He has helped me so much! like for real, i pry would have killed myself by now if it wasnt for him! we have soooooooo many memories together too! like my great aunt and uncles "lakes", and choking on flowers, and my having to outline his lips so he could color them in for our shows... haha... remember the looney toon i bought my car from?? i said that and you were like "shes not! shes just sad shes losing her car!!" then he pulled my hair and i hissed at him and he was like "your the looney toon!" or course, i wasnt til i met him! and so many more memories we have! haha, and remember when we were "going out" in 7th and 8th grade when all your girlie friends thought we were and kept asking me what it was like to kiss you?? and we havnt even ever hugged! Kasey, you are the best and you mean so much to me, lets not ever loose what we have! luv ya!   Taylor Ann ~ Tay-lo!!! Tay is on of my good friends... we used to be really tight but then some freak fight happened and we are slowly trying to rebuild our friendship.. she has helped me along in my walk with God too! acually, she was the beginning of it all, i swear, if i had to hear "will you come to youth group?? huh huh? it'll be fun!!!!!!" while she was bouncing up and down in my face one more time i would have killed her and gone to Hell! luckly to shut her up i went to youth group and from there on out God had a hold of my life and never gave up, and neither did Taylor!! Tay, i luv you so much!! you rock and lets try not to fight anymore.... it was REALLY akward and depressing for me!  HOLY COW!! i am super tired... i'll try to finish tommorow or the next day!!! luv you all and thank you to all who have sticked with me through all my PMSy moods, physconess, and just stupidness! i hope our friendships last long through the tears and years to where we are throwing our teeth at eachother and tripping one another with our canes!! luv you all and to all a good night:)
