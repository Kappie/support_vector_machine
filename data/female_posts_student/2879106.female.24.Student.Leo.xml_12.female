Instead today I am going to write about something positive.   Today I am going to write about friends:  First there is my best friend and soulmate Amanda K. She is so special to me and I want to thank her so much for being there for me and being my confidant. I truly believe that she is the one person in my life that I was supposed to meet to complete me. Too bad I am not gay huh.. HEHEHE To be serious for a moment, I really do love Amanda because she is a ray of sunshine in my life and I know that anytime I need her she will always be there for me. There is no one in the world that I can have such long, deep conversations with and I would never trade our talks on the back porch for anything. We can sit for hours talking about nothing and everything all at the same time. I wish every friendship could be like that. I would also like to say that I can't mention Amanda without mentioning Mike. He is like a brother to me and I couldn't ask for a nicer or more honest guy to have in my life.  Next there is Nicole. As you all know she is known as my savior. If it weren't for Nicole I wouldn't me here to write in this blog and I will never be able to thank her enough. Nicole has been in my life longer than anyone else and it is because of her that I wake up everyday and try to make something of myself. She is the one person that I would most like to be like because of her passion, determination, and compassion. She tells me all the time to bring her down off my pedestal but I just simply can't. In my opinion there is no one in the world that is more perfect than she is.  This now brings me to Amber. As of right now I do not have a title for Amber but she is like a sister to me. I would never be able to make it through the day without her encouragement. She is the reason I know that I will survive. She pushes me to be the best that I can be and it is because of her that I am now making something of myself. Plus she is the reason that I can now go to the mall and not worry if I spend too much money on a t-shirt. She will never know how MUCH that means to me. Also no one in the world can make me laugh like she does. We have so much fun together that all it take is seeing her to make me smile.  Last but not least there is Alisha. There is nothing really to say about Alisha but that she is my eternal optimist. I have never found anyone in my life who can see the silver lining the way she can. She is also my psychic friend. I will never have to call a one nine hundred number again. Also even though she is the most preppie of my friends, I love her just the same. Alisha is the one person I know that can make me happy to be alive and see that tomorrow is going to be a brighter day.  I have so many more friends than just these four girls but I have to say that they are the reason for living.  But I would like to acknowledge some other people before I end this blog. Of course there are my parents who put up with me when they probably could have just kicked me out a long time ago. There is my sister who will always be the most beautiful girl I have ever known. There is my high school friends that I still keep in touch with. When we get together it's like we have never been apart. Lastly, there are my friends at Lonestar and American General who make it bearable to go to work.   For now that is everyone that I can think of. If I have forgotten you it's only because it is so late at night and I am just tired. If you are really mad about it just E-mail me and I will get you into my next blog. I PROMISE!!! Love you all and thank you for everything that you have done for me in my life. My only hope is that I can be as good of a friend to you as you have been to me.
