And it's even more odd to return home to a life that, when you left, was hitting such a peak with nothing but more adventures on the horizon, now seems so disjointed, off-balance and brand new.    But I'm getting ahead of myself.  During the last few months, I've felt as though I was hurling toward something.  Something intangible, unknown, but unmistakable in its presence or importance.  The feeling became lost in the furor of the last few weeks of class, but re-emerged the more The Boy told me about this girl.  She sounded just right.  Too many damn coincidences  to be, well...coincidence, and since we don't really believe in coincidences anyway, they quickly became a big pile of signs.  Signs I couldn't wait to investigate, but much too big an idea to contemplate for very long, especially with five exams in two weeks to prepare for.  So, the Weekend After Finals became legendary before it even came to pass; it was the perfect motivation to get through the last stretch, the best subject for daydreams and the subject on most of my friends' lips the night of the big finale, the eve of my departure.    Had no real clear idea of what I was heading into, only that she'd won the Boy over, loved everything we love, and sounded exactly like me in more than a few ways.  To a self-proclaimed narcissist, that sounded pretty damn sweet!  I was going to be smooth, calm, confident, devastatingly charming and irresistible.  Then we'd see what happened.    What happened was absolutely nothing I anticipated and everything I hoped it would be.    She grew on me with every passing moment and I found myself quickly unraveling, quite unexpectedly and uncomfortably.  Saturday night found the three of us at her place with Kill Bill and Queer as Folk.  We all laughed at all the same scenes, finished the same lines and bantered with ad-libs.  Before I knew it, I was cuddling with someone for the first time in a year, and was terrified.  Not terrified enough to stop, mind you; no, it felt entirely too good to ruin with too much thinking.  Eventually, the credits rolled and we had a few moments alone, the moments I was craving and dreading.  Her calm, confident, devastatingly charming demeanor was entirely unnerving and completely comforting.  Here I had precisely what I'd been wanting and I couldn't move or even look her in the eye because when I did, I saw nothing but patience and understanding.  We managed to fashion a memorable goodbye at her door that couldn't have been more sweet, only to be followed by my graceless exit.    Now, I don't do well with confusion, especially my own.  And while I was relishing the night and how perfectly it ended, I tried to figure out just what the fuck was happening to me.  The last (first) time anything like this happened, I didn't think about it, just jumped in with both feet and was the comforting, steadying presence.  And now I didn't like being the one in need of comfort and steadying one bit; except for how incredible it felt.    And so, much of Sunday was spent in this place, filtering out my feelings, deciphering the sensations and trying like hell to reclaim my comfort zone, all the while trying to figure out how to reach over and hold her hand as we drove through the rainy forest.    The afternoon found our small gang back at The Boy's apartment, he and I telling story after story, each with three stories' worth of backstory and context-setting.  Found myself soothed by her quiet but solid presence and felt the tension between my shoulders melt away beneath her impromptu massage.  While Levi took a call in the other room, an opportunity to put the entire uncertainty mess to rest presented itself.  And, shockingly enough, the fog was lifted immediately after talking with her about the last day, how utterly discombobulated I'd become and listening to her say exactly what I needed to hear.  No pressure, no strings, we would go wherever this took us, at the very least becoming great friends in the process.  And as is the way with such talks, everything changed after this one; felt re-connected, more balanced and anxious to explore the feelings and sensations that had me in knots hours before.    The Boy and she decided the only way to end the weekend was with "Love Actually."  They were right.  For the second time in as many days, I found myself suggled beneath her comforter, her front glued to my back, and as much as I loved every scene, the damn movie couldn't have been over soon enough.  Eventually, though, we cleared her cozy apartment of its guests, and were left to our own devices at last.    The reel of that time together hasn't stopped playing behind my eyes all day and I'm sitting here in my own cozy apartment feeling disjointed, off-balance and brand new.  But finally, it's a good thing and I can't wait to see what happens next.
