If you want other abusive school songs or nasty songs about Barney the Dinosaur, I'm your gal. (And half of the tunes are from my mom, too.)   Tell me this- do normal people ever get stalker vibes when investigating the character of a boy they like? Natalia knows my 'crush' (Crushee? Crush recipient? Sorry, no names), kind of, and she was filling me on little details about his life, personality, etc. I know I shouldn't feel weird about this, as it's not exactly an uncommon practice, but the whole time I kept on getting creeped out by what I was doing. I feel even more icky about it now, after the fact. Apparently my transition into teenager-hood isn't complete yet. I'll just have to try harder to be okay with it.   Unless- is this something I should avoid? Is this kind of thing creepy and immature and to be avoided at all costs? Am I becoming a brainless idiot? God. I'm going to stop thinking about this now. All this second-guessing is just the Devil's advocate in me coming out.   Today was the last day of school. I am now officially a fresh-more, a teen stranded between ninth and tenth grades. Usually on the last day of school I get sentimental and think about how I'm never going to sit in these specific classrooms again, or how I'll miss the teachers (well, teacher-missage is rare), or whatever. In high school it's a lot different. I've been having finals for the past week, and I've stayed home twice. When you factor in the weekends and the reviews we were having for finals, I haven't had a normal day of school in two weeks. Most of the big projects were turned in even before that. I've had all this time to acclimate to summer, so there's not a lot of end-of-school appreciation. It's too bad, really. One of the best feelings in the world was that last-day shock, the realization that your imprisonment was over for two whole months. That feeling is mostly gone now.   Today was really a do-nothing day. I feel all lethargic and heavy-limbed. I came in an hour late and no one even cared. Almost all of the teachers and students hadn't bothered to come in, and at first I just wandered around the building looking for familiar faces. The few people that were there stuck with each other, regardless of which class they were supposed to be in. There were really only two important things that happened today, and even they're hardly worth mentioning. In Biology we watched a video on Einstein. Only five kids stayed for it. Stupid teenagers- no NOVA appreciation whatsoever. The part about old Al's personal life was pretty boring, but the theories! Oh, the theories. I want to go out and read a book on physics now. I actually made it into Honors Physics (I was one of only ten freshmen who got in), but I bypassed it in favor of Chemistry, the suggested choice. Now I kind of want to change my mind, but I guess it's too late. Oh, well- junior year.   The only other thing that happened today was that I went to Henna's English class and got my ass kicked at Scrabble. Yep- it was one hell of an exciting day.   Currently reading: About eight books at once. I have a bunch of  Cat Who...  mysteries that I've never read, so I'm working my way through those. I'm also finishing up  Watership Down  and trying to get through  Anna Karenina . I've got twenty books stacked up in my room waiting to be read on my upcoming road trip to Tennessee, and I've read a little bit of each of them. I got a lot of them off  urlLink Amazon  for my birthday. Gah. Just thinking about them makes my head spin. Note to self: never attempt to take on more than three books at once.
