This is who I am.  I do not mean to brag but it makes me feel so special. One of a kind! Not like any other! Feels good to be different from the rest! Alyssia was not home with me this weekend. So therefore, I come to work on Saturday. . What else is there to do? Stick my butt up, snoring like a pig while the sun shines on my ass? I love what I do and it makes me happy. Most important part of all, I got paid overtime. Extra money for me to spoil myself ha ha.    It isn’t shopping time because I hate to shop. I hate waiting in long lines. I hate to look for stuff.  Nevertheless, once I do shop, please do not try to stop me from having a lil fun. I hate it when friends say, “Let’s go to the mall to check out guys”. BULL SHIT, guys are trouble. Guys are heart breakers. No need for that. I am find being single. I love my freedom and therefore no one is gonna take that away from me. No one will and I mean it.    I came to work on Saturday. Worked from six am until one pm. Oh, did I mention that I was also drinking at work? Laugh it up. Yep, (Vodka and red bull).  I was pretty buzz by 11am.  What a very interesting way to start a day huh? There were only four of us in the office at that time and I figured it would be nice to try out something new. In addition, only Abby knew that I was drinking because she was drinking with me. It was so funny how once alcohol gets into my system I couldn’t stop talking. Hahaha. Ya de ya de ya de ya de.    Some funny feelings I have experienced that day. It was so hot and all I wanted to do was dance. Gosh man, I knew I should not have drank so early. Oh dang, it was getting to me, and then all of a sudden I was seeing colors, I was buzz by that time and I couldn’t stop singing.    I’ve always been in love with you I guess you’ve always known its true You’ve took my love for granted why… oh… why   How was I suppose to know which way the story go How was I to know you’ll break my heart   After work, had lunch with friends and chill at home then, I went out to play tennis and found some encyclopedia. That was awesome. Went out for dinner with a couple of friends at Pasta Pelican. Then shot pool. And called it a night.   Sunday, went out for lunch, look around for paintings, dresser draws, a fancy gold poster sized frame and play tennis. After all that, I went straight to bed. Out of nowhere surprisingly, a very good friend since Jr. High called and woke me up. Have not seen or chat with him in about a good long three or four years. Had a very nice charming conversation.  It was a very good impression to hear from an old friend occasionally.
