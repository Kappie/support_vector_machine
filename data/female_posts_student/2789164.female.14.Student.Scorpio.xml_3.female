I dont have ANY clothes that colour so i wore some pink striped hair cubes! HE HE i got around a loop hole there! Anyway we have netball practice soon and i have a history and RS project to do. STILL have to do them! anyway i can get it all done over the weekend cos we dont have any matches. BUT i am getting confirmed on saturday! is gonna be quite scary but cool :D after that im going to sleep at my friend Nats house for the night. My friend Chloe is coming over and we are gonna watch a vidio/dvd and then eat loads of food and chocolate (we are all chocaholics!) he he!!   anyway still loads of prep to do so i guess i will update later :D hedge
