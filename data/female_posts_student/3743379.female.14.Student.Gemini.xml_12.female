Oh!  And I also have not memorized your e-mail addresses, so those who are or want to be my friend, e-mail me!  ;o;  I ish so sorry!  X3   Kaffiene and Alena, we really need to work on when you can come, and it may have to be in august, because I have a birthday party to go to the 17th, and I'm gone the 24th-31st on a serve project in Woodstock, Ontario... so... T-T  I ish so sorry!   **  Added note:  Bring me REAL candy!  X3  **  **added note to added note:  I mean like smarties and aeros**
