It all started when I realized that I'm now more...um, sensitive, a bit touchy, or even down-right cranky. I get upset over little things, the lamest scene on tv could make me cry. Then I realized that I got this funny feeling in my tummy. I wonder what it is. Is it a panic attack? Or is it just another hormonal events. It happens a lot. But I'm pretty sure this isn't PMS. Or is it? As in post menstrual syndrome? Does that even exist? The nausea happened again just about...now. Everytime I think of 'someone' doing 'something'...I feel a lump in my throat and nausea. Is it anger? Or just plain sickness. Yuuuck!!! And yuuuuuuck again!! Better search for panic attack at google. Then head downstairs for some chocolate. Yuuuuck!!!
