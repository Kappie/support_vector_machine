I've been watching 'Hells Kitchen'! What a fab program! I mean who wud of thought that after just a week the celebrities would be able to cook for ova 70 people! It must be such a great personal achievement! God, amanda barrie trying to hit Gordon was probably the most funniest moment on tv so far this year! I want James to win, he's just a laugh really! Just as funny as when he's acting in Gimme Gimme Gimme! lol. Oh and Big Brother Looks great! Marco is definatly growing on me and want him to win, but its early days yet!
