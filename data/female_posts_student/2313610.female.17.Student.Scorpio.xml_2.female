Way too much caffeine for my system to handle, considering I can't really handle any at all. I just spent the last two days with two of my sister's friends, and though I tell everyone how much I hate it. I really love it. My sister's friends are really good people for the most part and they all like me, and we can all play games together whenever we want. I get the best of both worlds because, when I get tired of human interaction, I can go on my computer and they'll leave me alone until I want to come back. They don't expect anything of me except for some fun and help with video games. It's really much better than hanging out with people my own age, who expect things from you and you have to be careful about damn near everything.   So basically I enjoyed myself, though I'm left with a headache and now I'm feeling the absence of it all. I wish I had somewhere to go tonight, something to do, but no one really calls me outside of school. So I'm stuck here, writing in my journal, wishing it were warmer, or that I were somewhere warmer. But Hey, such is life.  I'll talk more later..  Faylinn
