Was only able to get the internet connection on the monday after i reach cos e school just started the new Ethernet system for each housing. Haha..... now i get 10 mbps connection speed.... whoo hoo!       Well its been quite a while since i updated this... haha hav been kinda busy going places and watching aussie tv progs to blog. Or should i say i'm jus too  nuah  to do it. Haha blame the weather.... ;p    Wow... its already 2 weeks plus tat i got here... it really seems fast! Was like just at e airport w all e luggages and saying goodbyes to family and frens.   My sis, alvin (opps must call him bro-in-law now ;p haha) and mom came to send me off and not to mention our dear classmates Shufen and Derek came to see us off.... so touched.... Thanx again guys for coming down all the way to send us off. :)        The last meal we had in SG was actually Mac breakfast in the airport terminal before boarding haha! Took Qantas flight, found it rather amusing that the safety demo b4 take off is done by stewards instead haha..... maybe its prob me being used to seeing stewardess doing that instead..... hmm which reminds me of kelvin's version of it tat he used to do to entertain us haha.......       The check out took us about 1 hour.... the airport customs is quite small... only have like 4 counters open for foreign passports check out! Plus they are really strict about wat u bring in. I brought in tom yam paste and have to bring it over the counter for them to check and scan e luggage again b4 i can clear customs..... phew.... looonng process i must say.       Our van came to pick us and another beckham lookalike guy ;p to our hostel... tot he was staying at e same place but apparently he's not.... haha then at least can  biyo  a bit  ;p but too bad... as cin put it... e perfect image we have of him is dashed hahaha..... cos we discovered tat he actually has a beer belly, dance weird and dont really look tat cute afterall... its just his hair.... haha... okie on to e next target..... lol      the airport is actually quite near curtin think it only takes about 20 minutes car ride to the hostel. We lived on the third floor and my room is near e rear exit room 4, opp cindy's while beside is Jay our new flatmate and rebec.         So far have been shopping, taking buses ard and walking abt...   Lets see... where i have been so far.... been to      Harbour Town - shopping!!
