Then...in the last full minute of the game, Milan decides, lets piss ashley off and score a point. Which by the way THEY DID NOT DESERVE. STUPID REF! The ref made a bad call and gave Milan a cornerkick, Okay, not to bad, they'll go onto penalty kicks and with these 2 teams it'll probably end up with sudden death. Well first kick, both teams 1 point, second kick, both teams miss (Keane, you're better than that!) Penalty kicks are rolling by, both teams making every one, so it comes to sudden death. Both teams make it. So they continue with the penalty kicks,  final score...  Manchester United 1-1 AC Milan Milan 9-8 PK  GRRR. Tim! he was expecting you to go for the right corner, everyone went for the right corner, he KNEW you were going to go for the right corner!! Why'd you have to go for the right corner?  Another game lost for United, But Scholes did play and that made me happy. He's my favorite player, that man is a beast! He's small, but you look at him and you just know he could take you out. And he's the one who scored for United by the way.
