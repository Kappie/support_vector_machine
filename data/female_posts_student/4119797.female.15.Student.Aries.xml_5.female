(Danielle is Leeanne's 12 year old sister, she's cool.) We spent most of the weekend drunk with these 2 guys Dan and Shane, that we met. It was Fiddlefest up there... Yes, 'Fiddlefest'. It should have been called 'Come to our tiny town and get drunk-fest'. But yes, it was all in good fun. So here I am now, with slightly less brain cells, listening to A.F.I. and thinking about all the stupid shit I did. Like walking into a screen door, falling numerous times, skateboarding and running into things and hiding from the cops. There's so much more but I can't remember it. I couldn't even remember what this site was. I also couldn't remember the difference between a Koala and a Panda bear. I also tried to convince my mom to get a trampoline out of boredom. It didn't work. Hmm... I need to regain lost knowledge.  Aww shit, I can't get rid of this bold font, I tried one of those keyboard shortcuts. Oh well, too lazy. Mmm, food.
