Being content with yourself and who you are is one of the best things there is, and wanting to get closer to God is always helpful in the process of becoming a better person and knowing what you want out of life.  I've chosen to be happy and not care what other people think and it's taken a realization that I can't control people and what they do, I can just be there to give advice and a empathetic nod. I can't change others, just myself. And i've changed into a happier, more fulfilled person. Thank God.
