Ok so I went to church where i thought i was gonna be hounded on by people saying i hurt Cody.....and which he wasn't even there...which kinda shocked me b/c i was planning to talk to him and b/c i don't think he's missed church in a while. OK the 411 on me and Cody....as of right now we are over....but we were kinda talking i guess i dunno anyways....i really really liked him and all and i was wanting something out of it but then WAM came a ton of bricks (b/c like Alex said: everythings goin good for you. it's too good to be true right? well just wait it will come back and slap you in the face don't worry. Well FYI it did and it hurt big time.....i broke things off with Cody b/c things were happening that i didn't want to happen it didn't have anything to do with him or how he was treating me it was more so b/c i was having other feelings and b/c those bricks that hit me left behind broken bones. A lot of things started going wrong and i didn't want to pull him into it. So instead i cut him off and prolly hurt him even worse...and trust me i feel horrible so i let him down as lightly as possible...i guess i wasn't light enough...i feel horrible and to be honest i think i might still like him....i dunno for sure but i know that i miss what we had...especially our friendship....we don't even talk anymore and i'm kinda scared to call him (i dunno why though).   I'm leaving for camp in 7 days!!! YAY!! i'm sooo ready to leave this crap town...no offense to anyone i'm just ready to get away from all the drama! i get back on Saturday then i leave again on sunday to babysit Mark and Tammy's kids at Illiana! then i come home on Friday and leave again on Sunday for SITS then i come home on Friday and i'm home for about 2 weeks then i go back to camp on the 4th of July and get home on Saturday unless i go to MC to hang with those cool cats!!! Oh and more news..this week i leave on Thursday to go to Newton to hang with everyone there!! b/c Newton is the coolest town ever!! haha! love ya guys too! Anyways...i just talked to Tyson...what a great friend...he's workin at the put put place in Newton so i atleast get to go see him YIPPEE and i get to go to FLora IL to hang with Dave on Saturday for his party then stay the night there or at Molly's house and chill with them then head to camp which would be a blast!! Well needless to say i am VERY VERY VERY excited to get outta town and get my summer started...especially by going to Newton then Flora then OBCSC!!! the best camp ever by far...been going there since i was about 4 or 5!   Also another interesting tid-bit. I have a new crush but i don't want anything to happen in the love department until i am home for the summer b/c i don't want to accidentally start hangin out with a certain someone at camp...but my lips are sealed!!!! LOL well alright chew on that for a while and i'll get back to you later! have a god day everyone and have a great fun and safe summer!  -Tori
