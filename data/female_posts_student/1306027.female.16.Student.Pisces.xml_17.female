Another reason for the absence of entrys could be the fact that I had an Essay and a research paper due by the end of school. The Essay was aight, got it done in 3 days. The research paper.. well.. lets just say the U.N. isn't as fascinating as people make it out to be. Insulting? Yes, but what good would a research paper be if you didn't insult just a little(Ok, a lot in my case).   Well school is out now, which is good. That means I can work extra hard at my spiffy new summer job ( Insert gagging sound here). I work at a coffee shop sorta place which means I deal with all types. Morning people, afternoon people, and generally weird people are my everyday frequents, some nice, some rude, some extremely rude, some totally awesome, some not so totally awesome, and some very annoying. *Takes breath* All-in-all though, it's not too bad of a job. I need the cash so you could say I don't complain too much. Hey! Shutup! I am not that bad. :-P  I am looking forward to my supa fly summer camp at Northwestern Uni.(Hahahahaha),starting at the end of June. Three whole weeks from the parentals and the city I live in...YA.. bring it on. I'm equipped 2 the T this year and I have saved up major loads of cash(Shopping, here I come). My class: Topics in Bio. Sounds like a blast. I love biology and I want to be a geneticist or a epidemiologist or... a virologist.. ya big words I know. I'll prolly end up going to college at Havard or Uni. of Chicago. I love Boston and I love Chicago, so either one would be awesome.  Back to the present. I have a dance recital in 4 days... lovely. Just how I wanted to spend my weekend. Grrrr. The costumes are pretty cute.... uh for blue sparkly spandex that is. Have you noticed how Disney seems to have a monopoly on everything this year? First about a million proms have it as a theme and then my dance studio had to go and pick "A tribute to Disney" as the recital theme. Coincidence? Hardly. I don't know about you, but I particularly do not enjoy dancing to a rendition of beauty and the beast by the group Jump5. (Tip: I cannot spell so do not take offense to the obvious errors.) That's it, I'm taking art classes next school year.
