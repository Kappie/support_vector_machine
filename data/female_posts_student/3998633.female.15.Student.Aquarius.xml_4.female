There have been some minor changes but not significant enough to produce a joke or anything remotely entertaining.  First off I took up tennis, not that I am any good, or even dress like a tennis player (white shirt and short shorts? no way) but it is a way for me to get excersice.  The second new event is that I am also starting to learn the electric guitar.  Half of me is a bit iffy about it because I was looking around the internet for electric guitars and it hit me, there is more than one style and one maker.  It's not like clothes when you  know  what is good and what is not; there are  loads  of electric guitars so I do not know if I want this as much.  How am I supposed to know why there are so many.  Are some used for certain types of music?, Do they sound different?, Is there one universal electric guitar that does everything?,  What do the most famous rockers use?  I need to know this information!  Hopefully I will find out, but right now I am just trying to decide if guys like girls who know the electric guitar.  One more thought, is it worth to take up a sport like fottie, rugby or skateboarding if you are 15?  Or is that to late to excel in a sport?
