I guess since its been a pretty laid back day I had time to think bout some stuff...I was thinkin bout oh this summer n NYE n all that stuff..and it got me thinkin. Well I really don't know how to say it all but w/e...I just feel like...our circle of friends or w/e from Synod would probably all be better without me. I feel like Im the one left out. Im just the outcast..the one whos just...there. No purpose just there. I feel like that now. Dont know why...just feels like everyones lives would have been better if I wouldnt have gone to Synod. Tho I still would have gotten to know some of them...Before Synod I had already joined YC so yeah. Dunno. Just kinda feeling left out. Tho I guess thats not new at all...Im left out here....So I guess theres no problem right? Yeah...I dunno...I dont even know why I even wrote all this....w/e...*shrug* Well im about to go to a movie...so im gonna go...
