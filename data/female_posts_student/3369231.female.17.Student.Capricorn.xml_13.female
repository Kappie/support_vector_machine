Nick won't tell me why he doesn't want his friend, Chelsea, talking to me.  He has no right to tell her if she can or can't.  And plus she seems pretty cool.  I am still waiting on his response to that and my lovely little comment on my previous post.  I don't know if he has read it or not though.  It would be such a shame if he doesn't.  Because then he wouldn't know how pissed off and hurt that I am.  Well, actually more pissed off now rather than hurt.  And Chelsea is right... a little ice cream solves everything... aren't I glad that Target has just that.  ICE CREAM!! Well next Friday I am leaving for South Carolina and I cannot wait.  No more bullshit from anyone around here and having to deal with shit.  I can go on the beach, check out some hot guys, and forget about all of my troubles back here in Indiana.  Well.. at least for a week anyways.  And hopefully whenever I get back everything will turn out for the better. Talked to Mike Hassel last night.. he finally got a job.  About damn time too.  I am proud of him.  At least his life is going pretty good. Well, Ashley should be extremely happy with me.  I am hopefully going to IU when I get out of Central.  I have made my decision.  I am ready to get out of this damn town.  Ashley and I can go to IU and forget about all of the shit and our troubles back here in Evansville.  So, Ashley aren't you happy!!  Woohoo!!  Now we just need to get Tommy up there with us and everything will be set.  Gee college is just around the corner.  Along with my ACT's coming up on Saturday.  You know that will be fun.. tons....
