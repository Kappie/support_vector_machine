(i am so pessimistic sometimes...)the BF picked it up today. When I saw it i was like - thats it ? just that little piece of metal cost over a 100 bucks? and caused so much frustration and almost cancelled our vacation? i could have made that in the garage! the BF wisely changed the subject. (I still have to come up with a alias for him, "the BF" sounds, well, stupid) 2)weather. now that we have the damned luggage rack, it looks like it is going to rain some of the weekend. Bf brought up a good question--what the hell is the difference between "isolated thunderstorms" and "scattered thunderstorms"??? do the isolated ones have abandonment issues, and the scattered ones are just unorganized??? what the hell does that mean? it means we are going to get rained on. but we decided we are going to go anyway. "its an adventure!" he says. why is it that when I want to go to the beach it rains? cant i have an adventure when it is nice out? so be it.   urlLink    pre luggage rack urlLink
