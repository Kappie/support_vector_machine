My textbook pages need some glue;  in fact, it seems I'm missing two.  The halls are packed, my locker's broke,  the lunchroom's fogged in hazy smoke.  The doors don't close; the window sticks.  My novel's dated '46.   I gasp as my aged desk chair creaks.  It hasn't broken in two weeks.  We need relief; it's not too late.  Today the lights are working great.  With budget cuts and stacks of bills,  rain pours through cracks; the classroom fills.  Our classes were outside last week.   No need to worry; just a leak.  The ceiling's cracked, the walls are chipped.  The chalkboard's white and the floors are tipped.  We only need a little aid,   if just to buy a can of Raid.  In smoky, musty, freezing air,  I cough and shake. It isn't fair.  Jessica Boelter, age 17  New Ulm High School, New Ulm   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  They are going to cut all the first-year teachers. Why would the governor want to cut our education when he got his education? That is so stupid.  Mercedes Steward, age 9  Marcy Open School, Minneapolis ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I think that cutting school budgets is a bad idea if we kick teachers out of their jobs. How do you think they would feel? Think before you do something. They should give schools more money because some schools can't even afford stuff like computers, laptops, desks, chairs, books and other important stuff. I thought Jesse cared more about education. Think about the students' future. How can we get jobs in the future without an education?  Yeng Yang, age 11  Hancock Hamline University Magnet School, St. Paul  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I don't really understand the budget cuts, but I may have come up with a solution that I think may work. We could sell all the schools and everything in them and use the money to buy a laptop computer for everyone. The schoolwork could be e-mailed every day to the students, and when the work is done, the day is over. If the work is not done, a private tutor paid by the parents would come to help. After a student learns so much, they can take a test that determines whether he can move up a grade or stay at the one they're on and learn more. Each district can keep one or two buildings for meeting once a week. In order to fit all the kids into one building, they would have to break the kids up into groups and have one group meeting a day. I think this could work someday. I know it would work for me. I wouldn't have to get out of bed as early.  Kyle Vasen, age 13  Coon Rapids ACE, Coon Rapids ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  At least the kids are trying. What's wrong with this country, that kids understand things so muhc better than adults do?
