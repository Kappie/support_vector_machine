Also, I finally got the chance to sit in one of those bubble chair things, and I've discovered that they are  not  as comfortable as everyone makes them out to be. I much prefer bean bag chairs. My sister has one. It has her name on it, too. It's very gushy and comfortable, but I think it must be  very  bad for your back, since it like forces you to slouch and stuff...   I've also discovered I don't like those breadstick things that come with pizza. They taste too strong. Nothing needs  that  much damn spice and...  taste . It made my mouth feel funny. Just give me some goddamn baguette!!! *sigh*   What else.... I didn't understand Kung Pow :p Everyone was just cracking up, and I was like hmmm... I think that cow's leg should be broken... I am such an analytical biatch hehe.   Anyways, I guess that's about it. I'm gonna be helping out at a concert tonight, at the Opera House, so that should be fun. I love being backstage there; sooo cool, with the blue lights and all... my only problem is that other than PN I don't know anyone there, which might be a bit awkward :p Ah well. I'll get over it.
