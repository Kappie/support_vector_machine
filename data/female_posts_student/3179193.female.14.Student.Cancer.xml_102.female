Jae and I took a walk to a nearby convenience store and bought a pack of cigarettes and 2 lighters. I had 8 bucks left on me and he had 3 bucks. The pack of cigarettes was 8 bucks approx and the lighters were approx 3 bucks. So it all worked out. I payed for his cigarettes and gave him one of my lighters to smoke with. I kept one of the lighters. It's black. Hehe~! Fav colour. Anyway... yeah. His parents came afterwards and golfed with us. The two of us were really tired so we went and read comics instead. Before that, we also went outside to a nearby park and started a small fire in the middle of a clump of trees... so basically we were out of sight. The fire got A LOT bigger... like a campfire and there was a lot of wind and we didn't want people to see the smoke so we stopped it and then ran back. It was a lot of fun! Hehe~!  Then we went to Galleria supermarket and walked around while his parents shopped. I got myself some noodles with the 80 cents I had left. Haha!   I wanna call Nima but Julie's on the phone so screw it. Taking a shower in a few minutes maybe.
