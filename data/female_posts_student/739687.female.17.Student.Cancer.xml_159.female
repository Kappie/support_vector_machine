You know, besides the fact that at one point I was going 20 over the speed limit...I did really good.   Ahh geez....funniest thing EVER:   *silence at lunch table* Manda: So...did you hear about the guy who tried to kiss his girlfriend in the fog and mist? (Yes...it's spelled wrong for a reason.) Me: WTF....  --Later--- *Manda goes up to Rachel* Manda: Hey, did you hear about the guy who tried to kiss his girlfriend in the fog and mist? Rachel: No, I haven't!   HAHA. So  FREAKING GREAT!   Who could ever imagine Algebra 2 worksheets could provide so much entertainment?  Well, that's about all for my day. I'll catch you crazies later.
