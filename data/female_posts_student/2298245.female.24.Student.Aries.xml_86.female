It's starting to get dark so it's hard to tell, but looking up at the lights outside, I can still see drifts of snow floating through the air.  I'm sorry to keep harping on the snow, but I am starting to get a little worried about the commute home tonight.  It should be fine though...my bus is on a main road that I'm sure is being kept clear, but still...it's cold and icky out and I'm going to have to stand and wait for the bus.
