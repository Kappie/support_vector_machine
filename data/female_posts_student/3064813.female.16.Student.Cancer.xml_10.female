I assume, however, that it will be a rather obscene amount of fun.  You can see how I am divided upon such moral quandries as displayed here. Interesting, yes?  Well, I think so.  Crap, I only have approximately five minutes left of joyful internet capering.  This saddens me, and fills me with pain at the prospect of reliving last night's insomnia.  It was very boring and very tiring, and I don't feel good.  I need to go wash my face.
