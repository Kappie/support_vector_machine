I think he likes her, but im not to sure. Damn fool. I need to fetch myself a life. I do have one. But i waste alot of my time sitting here what could of happend if blah and who blah blah did so and so, of i did blah and blah. AH fucker. At least this other person who i did like, i dont like anymore, and i happy for it. Guys should die. DIE. haha.   I also ponder why no one makes comments. I want to argue with people. About differen't random things. Maybe becausenot many people read this. Well not many people know about it. Hmph, well also another thing is i dont want many people to know about. Mostly the people i hang out with, or people i truely despise.   Well i guess this could be an interesting topic if you are interested in the Government. See over summer holidays i was having a good conversation with my dad and this other person about the government. Before this conversation i hated the government, now i simply hate it even more. For example Pr.Bush:He sents 100s of thousands of u.s troops to look for weapons of mass destruction, when CIA and the FBI said that there would be none. Do you think that Iraq could aford weapons of mass destruction? And out of all presidents in the u.s he has had more vacation then any of them. 6 months. And weren't the majorityof the votessomehow lost in the states,uncounted for? I will make more comments about this when i find out more stuff.But also how the canadain government scamed 1.5 BILLION dollars from us. And its funny, because they say they dont know were it went. Hmmm.... just think about that? This money could go to way more important things. Taxes are not going to worthy causes, the gun registration, that amount of money couldgo to our schools.To under privillaged childeren. The goverenment is a bunch of liars. Peopleshould want to pay taxes, knowing its going to a cause, not into the governments pockets.people should not pay taxes out offear.Didyou know that 40 cents out of every dollarfor a person who pays taxesgoes to the government? What will happen when the youthnow grow up? Will the govermenttake over halfof our income? Really though what arewe going todo about it. We have to do something, if the goverment is running our countryfearing us all. Am i going to half togive the goverment the majority of my money? The goverment isa bunch of bitches. And we need to do something aboutit.   Hannah
