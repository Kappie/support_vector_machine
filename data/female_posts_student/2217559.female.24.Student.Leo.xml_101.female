She's just very soulful. Actually I read that this cd she has released was released way before Curve Records wanted to release it.  She's just too damned good. She recorded The Soul Sessions in 4 days. That's incredible.   Okay, enough about music (even though my heart bleeds for new artists), I am coming to the close of a long day. I don't like working 9-5.  It sucks. It's just so damned repetitive - I mean I miss my afternoon naps that I used to get from 1:30-4:30p.m. every day.  Hahaha, I am so spoiled.  Congratulations to my friend Bekah who gave birth to her 2nd baby, Carter, today. i get to be an Auntie again. Hehehe (oh to her excitement...hahaha).  I have always told her that if she ever wants her kids to learn anything, she should let me babysit for a few days. When Emma's 8 yrs old, she'll be shaving her leggs and wearing Prada. Hahaha. Oh, what a thought.  I don't have much to write. Just thinking about everyone. Hi Paddy.  Love.
