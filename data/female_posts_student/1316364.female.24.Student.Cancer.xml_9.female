He told me he had something to tell me that might make my day worse. I told him I highly doubted that but to share any way. He told me that yesterday he found out that the three weeks he spent in Arizona was now for nothing. That the equipment they trained him on they are not going to use when they get overseas.  He said so basically the ARMY took three weeks away from him that he could have spent with me helping with the apartment and getting a chance to spend a little more time with me then he got to. I felt real bad after hearing this and wondered if the Military liked wasting money to send their soldiers to training they wined up not using. It makes me mad when I think about it. Everything was rush, rush for no reason. I really do hate this.
