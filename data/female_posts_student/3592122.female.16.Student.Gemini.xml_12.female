I was born intelligent -  education ruined me.   .........................................................................    Practice makes perfect.....  But nobody's perfect......  so why practice?   .........................................................................    If it's true that we are here to help others,  then what exactly are the others here for?   .........................................................................    Since light travels faster than sound,  people appear bright until you hear them speak.   .........................................................................    How come "abbreviated" is such a long word?   .........................................................................    Money is not everything.  There's Mastercard  Visa.   .........................................................................    One should love animals.  They are so tasty.   .........................................................................    Behind every successful man, there is a woman  And behind every unsuccessful man, there are two.   .........................................................................    Every man should marry.  After all, happiness is not the only thing in  life.   .........................................................................    The wise never marry.  and when they marry they become otherwise.   .........................................................................    Success is a relative term.  It brings so many relatives.   .........................................................................    Never put off the work till tomorrow  what you can put off today.   .........................................................................    "Your future depends on your dreams"  So go to sleep   .........................................................................    There should be a better way to start a day  Than waking up every morning   .........................................................................    "Hard work never killed anybody"  But why take the risk   .........................................................................    "Work fascinates me"  I can look at it for hours   .........................................................................    God made relatives;  Thank God we can choose our friends.   .........................................................................    The more you learn, the more you know,  The more you know, the more you forget  The more you forget, the less you know  So.. why learn.    .........................................................................   A bus station is where a bus stops.   A train station is where a train stops.   On my desk, I have a work station....  what more can I say........
