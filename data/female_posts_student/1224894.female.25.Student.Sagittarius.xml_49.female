I’m 22 for a moment She feels better than ever And we’re on fire Making our way back from Mars.  15…there’s still time for you Time to buy and time to lose 15… There’s never a wish better than this When you only get a 100 years to live.  I’m 33 for a moment Still the man but you see I’m a they A kid on the way A family on my mind  I’m 45 for a moment The sea is high And I’m heading into a crisis Chasing the years of my life.  15…There’s still time for you Time to buy and time to lose yourself Within a morning star.  15… I’m alright with you 15…There’s never a wish better than this  When you only got a 100 years to live.  Halftime goes by Suddenly you’re wise Another blink of an eye 67 is gone The sun is getting high We’re moving on…  I’m 99 for a moment Dying for just another moment And I’m just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are.  15… There’s still time for you 22… I feel her too 33… You’re on the way Every day’s a new day.  15… There’s still time for you Time to buy and time to choose Hey 15… There’s never a wish better than this When you only got a 100 years to live.
