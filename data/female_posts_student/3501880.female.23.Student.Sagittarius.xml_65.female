So, in case you are wondering, that is why I am posting obsessively to my blog. I thought it about time for me to revisit my Likes/Dislikes List!   Likes : taking mental health days. the movies. subway sandwiches. V8 splash smoothies in orange creme. booze that doesn't taste like booze. drunk-dialing. reminiscing. the smell of fresh-cut grass and gasoline (individually). ice cream. "flavors of the day". programmable coffeemakers. living alone. chatting. staring into space. text messages. the manager at the movie theatre. boy bands. saying things like, "quite". a new pair of pants. my "i heart nerds" shirt. steve carrell in "anchormen". on-air with ryan seacrest. imagining ryan seacrest using the phrase "seacrest in. seacrest out. seacrest in. seacrest out." during sex. fireflies. full moons.   Dislikes : tom cruise. junk mail. needy cats. dirty dishes. paula abdul. going to work. being an adult. the british (as a whole, not individually). the view. not receiving my us weekly in a timely manner. the po-po. quiznos. not getting any text messages in a day. hands-free headsets for cell phones. my gag-reflex.
