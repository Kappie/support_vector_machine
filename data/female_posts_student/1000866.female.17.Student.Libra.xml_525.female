That was when I was bowling with my parents and I had a 99 right before entering the last frame, and my dad was teasing me like, "don't mess up, don't mess up!" and then I got two gutter balls. Grrr, I was so mad. But then today, I go into the 10th with a 98. The first ball, I hit ONE pin. One stinkin' pin. I was like...oh no, there's no WAY I'm getting a 99 again. And then I hit pins, and ended up with a 105. That's good for me! So, yay! Exciting times in bowling.   Evening With Humanities rehearsal was really good. Pretty fun actually. Tomorrow's going to be a realllly long day though. Oh well, hopefully it'll at least be fun.
