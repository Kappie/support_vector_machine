In case people couldn't figure it out, I have been in a bad mood lately. Not a typical bad mood, mind you, but what I call black depression. When I am in one of those moods, all I want to do is cry. Everything looks and feels hopeless, and I stand at the edge of an ever-deepening abyss in my mind, not knowing if I am going to fall in. Everything overwhelmes me, and nothing overwhelmes me(i mean, in the sense that nothing can happen, and I am still overwhelmed). Fortunately I have a couple of people that I can talk to when that happens, besides my husband. The two of them know who they are, so I will not embarrass them by putting their names on here. Suffice it to say, one is my sissy, and one is a dear friend. Unfortunately, talking does not always help. But I do feel much better today than I have in a long time, even though I had a troubled sleep and really don't feel rested. Ah, well. Life goes on...
