Preheat oven to 350F.  Set pan aside on a baking sheet.    Melt butter in a medium saucepan.  Add sugar, water, and cinnamon.  Cook over low heat, stirring till sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes.  Stir in cranberries, pour into pan and spread evenly.  Cake batter: 1 1/2 C cake flour (I use regular all-purpose flour) 1/2 t baking soda 1/2 t salt 3/4 stick butter, at room temperature 1/2 sugar 1/2 c packed light brown sugar 2 eggs 3/4 sour cream 1 t vanilla  Sift together flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.  Beat butter and both sugars together till smooth and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each.  Add half of flour mixture, mix well.  Add sour cream and vanilla, mix well.  Add the rest of the flour mixture, mix well.  Spread batter in pan, covering berries evenly.  Bake 45-50 minutes (it always takes longer than this -- more like 65 or 70 minutes) until top is golden brown and edges come away from the sides.  A toothpick in the center should come out clean.  Set the cake on a rack for 10 minutes to cool.  Run a knife around the edge to loosen the cake.  Invert it onto a plate.  Remove the foil, the ring, and the pan bottom.  Replace any cranberries that have escaped, cut into wedges and serve.  VERY pretty, very holiday-ish, slightly tart, very moist.  Yum.
