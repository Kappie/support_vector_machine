What's wrong with me?! Ah! I wasn't looking the best... I kinda looked like a skate punk in mah gray jacket and ski hat. Although- the messege on the hat could have thrown him off. Lol. My hat says Flirt. I'm sure he got a kick outta that one. Or maybe he didn't care. Idk- but I saw his mom with him tonight. He set up this chair thingie in the hallway for her. I was so tempted to walk over and ask her what her sons name was, but, that might have looked bad. LOL. Im such a dork- It's seriously so funny to watch me. I wish I had someone braver than I to stick with me and make me ask him his name. Then maybe I wouldnt have to wonder about it all the freaking time.   Aight- thats all  I know.. he must be some cool guy if I dedicate a post to him every tuesday. Well maybe I would know if I wasn't so shy! Ah! Leave me comments on how to get over this!    Love Always, Meg.
