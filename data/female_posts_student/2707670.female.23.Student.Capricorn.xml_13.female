More and more of our imports come from over seas." ~a wise statement from our fearless leader~  or maybe this is better...  "For every fatal shooting, there were roughly three non-fatal shootings. And, folks, this is unacceptable in America. It's just unacceptable. And we're going to do someting about it." ~guess who once again~  Have a super great night everyone!
