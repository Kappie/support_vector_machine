There is still alot to do. alot on my mind.  I really enjoy band i know that, but know i also have to be someone that ppl look up to. How could i ever fill Roberts shoes? He was a god to me. I dont want to imagine walking out on the practice field and not seeing him standing there laughing, joking w. someone. coming over and talking to me about something important. I MISS HIM! you never appreciate the things you have until there gone. But thats not true either, b.c. i did. I always looked up to Robert. was always in awe of him. sigh...band wont be the same. But i'm here, on my last day of freedom, taking a diagnostic SAT test. Realising that i have alot of work to do.  I get these crazy, over-my-head project ideas that i become obsessed with. Like the huge quilt design, when i had never sewed in my life. And now again i want to make a skirt. out of ties... and i have the ties. i have the sewing machine...i just lack the know-how, skill, time, probably commitment, and faith. but i'll start it anyway. and see where it gets me.  i procrastinate so much. Thats my huge tragic flaw, right there. Nothing ever gets done with me, b.c. i wait, put it off, say i'll do it. say i am doing it. and go do something else completely unproductive. sigh. i'm my own worst enemy. but then again, who isn't there own worst.  so now, i'm going to go figure out how to go about this SAT mess, read GOW, make my skirt, learn about 500more words, make a cd, fix up my room, andwatch as many movies as i can before i fall asleep and then have to wake up at 7 in the MORNING! ready, set...
