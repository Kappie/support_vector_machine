Here are the reasons why:  1) My fave teacher in the whole wide world, Mr. Masengill, was falsely accused by this stupid freshman girl that he pressured her into having sexual contact with him.  Its complete bullshit we all know it, but there's nothing we can really do about it.  Some people organized a rally at the police station.  That was pretty cool.  We had signs and we got free mountain dews for standing out there for awhile.  I was glad to discover how many people support Masengill.  But i was still depressed that this whole arresting thing even happened.  2) Coppell loses to Jesuit 3-2.  I sniffled on the way out of the game.  I cried when i got home.  The whole day had been a shitty day and when they lost, i lost it.  It sucked.  And the worst part is that we had a 2-0 lead for almost an entire period.  And then the last 7 mins or so, we cracked.  T.J cracked.  We fell apart.  Jeez, the jeering of those stupid Jesuit people is still ringing in my ears.  I really just wanted to wake up this morning and have us still win the game and Masengill is not in legal trouble.  It was sooo sad.  Man, i can't wait until i can drive.  I will so be staying after next time to kick some Jesuit ass.    There are other reasons why i'm incredibly depressed this week, but i don't feel like typing them out.  Stars play San Jose tonight and me, britty and jess are going to the game.  If they don't win, this week has officially been a shitty week.  Gotta go.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
