I AM SO MAD.  its like..id rather shoot myself, it'd be much less painful.  IM PISSED BECAUSE I DIDNT EVEN GET TO TALK TO MANDEEP BEFORE HIS LIKE..MOST IMPORTANT DATE IN HIS LIFE: COURT DATE. I WAS BASICALLY LOCKED UP IN MY ROOM FOR A LONG ASS TIME WITH NO PHONE NO NOTHING, NO NOTHING. NOTHING WHATSOEVER.  I cant even like..find words to express how sorry I am Mandeep. I am so sorry, so sorry, I wouldnt be surprised if you dont talk to me for a while.  I WAS SO PISSED. YOU DONT UNDERSTAND.  your mom hates me and my family but loves iishas?  hmm,  comforting.  How bad is my luck. The crappiest things always happen to me.  LIfes a bitch whats your excuse?  I need to get out of here, I cant take this shit anymore. The one person I thought I had, I think I just lost..yeaa, the one person that made me feel like I was the best. wow, how that can change in a matter of 1 day.  that phone call..its so hard to imagine whats going to happen next. i thought the worst.      make it work? how will we manage to do that.  im your life? so if i just died one day, you would be finished too?  I dont know anybody who could care more about you than me, not even your mom would or..could as a matter of fact.  gifts for me?? Theres NO point, YOU ARE MY GIFT. YOU. THATS IT.  May 21st = the day I fucked things up to the max. I dont think we were ever the same or ever will be.  this isnt working.  i dont want this life anymore. i wanna get out, i wanna jus..die.  no matter how hard i try, i will never ever be able to make up for how i fucked things up. never.  no matter how hard i try, i just cant make things okay. i cant, theres like no way..not possible.  people say it'll be okay, people say just be urself and everything will roll through jus fine..  HOW CAN I FUCKIN BE MYSELF WHEN I DONT KNOW HOW THE FUCK 'ME' IS?  HOW  TELL ME.  this is some fuckin bullshit, this life?? life is beautiful?? HAa..  LOVE is BeAutiful?? Love is pain. espeacially when people like me are fucking things over for everyone.  seems like im good at fucking up peoples lives. i mean..thats what it looks like to me.  i dont even know what to fucking do, i dont know what to fucking say..  theres no room for me in this life anymore..  no room.  out.  status? dead.
