I guess I've just been busy REPLACING the 1000 songs I lost off of my computer.  Oh well it's been kind of good actually.  I'm re-exploring all of the music that I love.  If anyone else is excited for the retreat...can I get an AMEN?  Here's hoping that our youth group can get along and be as non-cliquey as possible.  Shakedown 1979.
