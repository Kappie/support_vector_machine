All this week I've been introduced...as it were, to the Democratic national convention. Which makes since considering they're both democrats. Today I caught the last half of Kerry's speech about his role as a President. This qoute and what he said about his religion caught my attention. But this particularlly. I don't like how he put this. now, granted I'm not a democrat, but I'm not a republican either. There's most likely things that will rub me the wrong way with Bush's speech. But this sentence says to me that American's are equal to God and we get to decide if we're on God's side or not. Maybe I'm taking this the wrong way...but that's what it says to me.   Why do we even have to have a president? It's irritating...especially coming from a house that has one parent in each political party. It's sickening how one conversation about stupid poiltics can ruin a whole afternoon or night. How one mention of political issues (gay marriage, middle class, social security) can enrage so many people. Quite frankly, its disgusting. I hate it. I hate the problems it causes and the people it divides.   Maybe I won't even watch the republican convention to see if anything strikes me...Let me rephrase that- I won't.
