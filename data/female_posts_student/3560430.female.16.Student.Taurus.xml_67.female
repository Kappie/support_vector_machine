My plan is to get a little bit (very little) of excercise every day. I plan on walking to the skytrain station. Ooh Aah. My parents are thinking about getting me a transit pass. I really hope they do because then in the after noon I can bus home, you know when it is insainly hot out, that and I can bring myself to the school. Kung Fu school. At least my lunch will be good.    Beth and I just aren't sure what to expect. Will it be fun, boring, annoying? I hope it's the first of the lot. We've vowed to allow reading time when on the train in the morning, both of us will need to do that and niether of us are very sociable in the morning anyhow, talking in the morning isjust a very quick way to get into a fight.    I've asked my parents to make dinner relativly early tonight so that I can go to bed and read for as long as I normally would, (even though it will be like 9 and still light out). I also have to make arrangments to have to two o'clock voyager taped. god I love star trek (stop making faces at me beth). I'm sure mom will if Iask really nicly it's not like we are taping anything else. I don't think that I will bother with the three o'clock because that is a bit obsessive and I'm not as into that one as I am into the two o'clock.    I'm still hoping that beth and I can get to that tutoring thing. It sounds like a very good way to get some cash. hint hint.    Sigh I should be doing somthing, I'm not sure what but I'm pretty sure there  is somthing.    BTW: Beth you should start studying history and lit pretty soon, I understand that it is august but if you don't you're not going to do much better on the make up test, and that is your last chance, your mother can't annoy you about this one so I will, get to it girl you've only got a week!
