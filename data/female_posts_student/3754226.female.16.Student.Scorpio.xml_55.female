Recently, things have been so fast and direct that it has passeed through my mind like a whirlwind and whether i like it or not, i have no choice but to approve myself of the possibilities and the thingsthat have been currently preccupying my mind. I know deep within me that this is not a dream. Girl, this is the REALITY. The reality ive started to neglect and to reconsider, ive made a dream without this reality of which i wish it were not true. But the opposing forces of my mind keep on colliding that i lost myself for regaining the existing belief, i had started from where i think now is some sort of a lost fate. Now, pitifully, i must say that i have started to earn a degree for myself that instead of me being pulled up, i am pulled down my own esteem of seeing no other that what is obvious and what i think now is abnormal but for him, is VERY NORMAL. Now, how can i face my unpredictable world with me believing that everything is not normal but for him, NOTHING'S CHANGE? well if he thinks that providing a sole time with himself is much better with me clinging into him on a saturday night, simply forgetting to remind me of daily usuals which he unmindfully notices the that everything is not just normal and usual, if he thinks that him not even talking to me for more than five minutes in a day personally is normal, then it provides a n absurd explanation which up to now, i still cannot perceive. I will only see a foolish me crying and wailing over him with a reason i still cannot provide. Now, i now don't even know what to do. Maybe i was just influenced by his abnormality. If only he knew all this, but would he listen?
