After that I practiced my spanish words for my test tomorrow. *yikes* Then I bid on the switchfoot tickets but I got over bid...by one stinking dollar.  But then I was looking on ebay and there are two more tickets up for bid so I will try to win those, if I don't win then its okay. I will just go to see spot rock and the sea of faces tour.  Today matt and i were supposed to clean so I have been waiting for forever. He just got home from his friends hosue and he is emptying the dishwasher. So,  while I was waiting for him to get home I just played my guitar for an hour. It was  very peaceful. I wrote a pretty song, you all have to hear it. But I probably wont get it on my album until I get garage band..I hope I get it soon! I need my album to come out NOW!!! :D  Well...today I have tennis. Which I am not tooooo excited but yeah. I am going to try to play a chalenge  match against Kelsey becasue I am positive i can beat her. Then I will be #31 which is quite excelent. I am kind of tired of tennis. It seems like all my friends are like "I love tennis!" "Tennis so easy!" "I hope I can beat #20 beacause then I will be #7 on JV!"  For me, every day at tennis is a new struggle. Everyone always seems to think they are better than me. The problem is, I  know I am really good at tennis. It just seems like I can't do it when people are watching me. Maybe thats why I love to be alone. While I am alone I can do all things, I can get straight A's, I can sell a platinum album, I can be the tennis champion at wimbleton. But in the eyes of others, they are always better than me. No matter how hard I try they will always be better than me.  But that is not the truth, I know I can do ALL THINGS. But only through Christ..and he and I have been kind of distant lately. It makes me sad....   But he is MY strength.  Lead me to the waters of forgiveness.  Hold me never let me go.  cuz i'm your child.  Though I try so hard,  I never cease to fail.  But, your my Go.  your always here for me...     Though I run  You place me in a hding place  Where i can stay..for a bit.  Your my refuge...  through the stormy times..  So, hold me- never let me go.
