Have you guys also checked out the MSN group for RPC Youth?  urlLink  It is here  and has some cool stuff, like pictures, and the latest "Slamball: Vincent Edition" updates. Intense reading guys.  Sometimes I get the feeling that that MSN group has a lot of potential fun, but it's just not given the proper publicity it needs... people need to know the URL and it needs to be flashy and have random pictures in places. But I guess they don't allow you to edit the source much, crazy MSNers.
