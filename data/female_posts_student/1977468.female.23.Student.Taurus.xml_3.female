Soon I'll have a few linked pages to this one with pictures and songs and stuff. It'll be cool. Notice the banner is gone? Yeess.... that costed me money! Love it, please.  Last night I dreamed I was a Barbarian Hero. There was a fortress built on a coastline somewhere, and I defeated the army that lived there. How you ask? I lured them  outside . Thats right! That could be a deep thought if given enough leeway. The army and I had a round 2 though as well, because later on they kidnapped my fricken wife and were planning on having her marry the king of the fortress. "NO WAY" you say. Yes way. This time though I just walked along the wall where they couldn't see me to the back of the fort and saw her through one of the windows... so I busted through the window and she jumped into my arms. Then we evaded them as they persued us by swimming up a sandy bottemed stream into the highlands. Then we made sweet love in the bushes. It was an awesome dream. Eventaully all rationale fleeted though, because we heard a jeep coming, and as it turned out we had somehow stumbled upon a WW2 battlefeild. I'm not sure how, but I ended up having a fist fight over the cockpit of an old-style bomber while my wife remained on the ground hiding near a waterfall from an artillery scout. The bomber ended up crashing and my dream said "game over", and suddenly I was looking at the main menu for a video game. Then I heard Joe say "you suck at this" and he started reconfiguring my keys.   I want more dreams like this, so im gunna go!  PS. Whoever you are, drink more water. You shall thank me with your thoughts.
