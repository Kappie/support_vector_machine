I got a tank top thing in camp today that I have to wear on like feild trips and stuff because.... we had money to blow? But yeah they gave them out like a few weeks ago, but since I wasn't there I didn't get one, and am therefor stuck with the large. I was already wearing a different shirt so I just put that one on top and I was sweating like a fucking whore in church. But then again, because that shirt is so big, if I hadn't been wearing that shirt underneath the whore reference would have been much more literal.
