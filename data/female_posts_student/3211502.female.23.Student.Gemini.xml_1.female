But, recently, ever since I turned 18, my birthdays haven't really been that hot. Back in the day, I used to throw huge parties, invite lots of friends, and have a spectacular time. But, once I got to college, everything changed. My kick-ass school-year birthday suddenly became one of those dreaded summer birthdays. So, in college, I resigned myself to having quiet birthday celebrations with my family and some friends.   Last year, though, things were a little different. My birthday fell right smack dab between the last day of final exams and commencement. So, since plenty of my friends were around, I was able to throw a little shindig. This year, though, I really don't know what to do. Yet again, my birthday is a "summer" birthday. I figured Garth would come out and spend the weekend in NYC with me or I'd go out to Boston and spend the weekend with him. But, OF COURSE, knowing my luck, my birthday weekend has to be his BUSIEST weekend at work.
