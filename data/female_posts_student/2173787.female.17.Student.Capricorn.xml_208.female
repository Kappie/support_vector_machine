In less than 4 weeks classes will be over and in 3 weeks work will be finished.  Yay right? Well the think I forgot in all of my looking to the future was all of my casual friendships.  People I'm not close enough to  pick up the phone and make plans to see a movie with them.  I love the guys at work, we have a blast joking around and goofing off in class, yet we have no real common ground for a friendship.  Unfortunately the more I think about this year ending the more I realize I've forgotten.  I've forgotten that we are all individual variables, not constants.  I've forgotten that every year, every month, every day, every moment I change.  My thoughts, my actions, my values they all are constantly changing and so are everybody else's.  With the end of school comes summer at time where we all grow distant and lead individual lives.  I will leave camp a different person than I was when I arrived.  I will return to a world that has changed without me, friends who have also done so.  With summer uncertainty returns, what will be here when I return? Will we still be able to be close?  To reform the bonds that tighten every year?  Or, will my entire world no longer keep me content, will I be searching for that feeling that can only come with change? When counting down the days it is easy to forget so many things, to push aside all fears of the future just to escape the present.  Now that I can see the light it is too late to turn around and run in the opposite direction, but it is the only thing I want to do now.
