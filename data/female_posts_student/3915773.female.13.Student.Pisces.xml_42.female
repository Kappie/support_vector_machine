It also found more sex and profanity in R-rated movies ("Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian") than a decade ago.  "when you look at the average, today's PG-13 movies are approaching what the R movies looked like in 1992,' said Kimberly Thompson, associate professor of risk analysis and decision science at Harvard's School of Public Health, who was a co-author of the study. 'Today's PG is approaching what PG-13 looked like a decade ago."  When parents look at a movie to buy for their children and they see PG, they consider the movie to be remotely safe for their children. In actual reality, the perception of the public eye is changing and what seemed violent ten years ago is is not enough to satisfy this generations appetite for violence.  When a customer looks at the rating, they can usually see why the movie is rated what it is. The M.P.A.A. has created so many different meanings for the same word that the original message can get misinterpreted. For instance, what is the difference between violence and action violence?  When parents are concerned about what their child is watching, it would most likely be best for them to either preview the movie themselves or to have a family movie night and spend some quality time with their children.
