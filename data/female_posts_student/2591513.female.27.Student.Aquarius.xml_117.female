It was cool to be playing with Kata, she isn't around as much as we would like so when she is here, it is nice.  We but heads like rams, but I have nothing but love for her.  I am glad she decided to stay up here and hang out.  It has been far too long.  I am waiting here wanting Bailey to go to bed, but he isn't going to bed.  I hope he falls asleep soon.  We will see.  I wanna play again.  I am addicted to MP5.  HAHA  Anyone with me?
