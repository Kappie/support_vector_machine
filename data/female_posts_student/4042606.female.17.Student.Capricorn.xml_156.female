I will probably be sucked into it like I was yesterday, so I will be up until 1 in the morning playing it. Then I will be going to work until eight. So yeah, my time is short. Typing this now is even taking up precious time that could be going to Kingdom Hearts. So I am going to stop talking now, and go save Atlantica from the evil clutches of the Heartless.
