I'm blind but i see faces, i see faces Of all colours, types and of all races  Whenever i take a walk in a mall or maybe a stroll down the street.  I see faces.  I am blind but i see faces.  and, though i am blind this i do know.  Each face has a story untold.  Each face, a legend to mold.  Everyone has secrets and everyone has lies.  I wish i could just see them as their true selves and ask:  " What is  your  story?"
