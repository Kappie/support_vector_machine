And altough I have never even talk to the kid, and have high suspicions he doesn't even know who the hell I am...all I have to say is that he is pretty damn smart. He said that he is sad because of the lack of love, and the impossibility there of.  Dude... I can relate (and probably can most of my friends). He also said that guys only complain in their journals, which is correct. Anywho, I just wanted to give props.  Props?....umm Katherine, you are white.   'Tis true.  I am mad I missed the basketball game last night (well not really, to tell the truth), I am more upset I missed the benefit concert. That Morgan Stewart girl seemed like she was really good when Mr. Lawton played her cd in choir. I dunno... I just felt kinda of sick. Not sick so much in the physical sense, but just sick of....oh i dunno....nevermind.  I had to give my Self-Intro speech yesterday. I did pretty well, and was only slightly nervous. Ha! I guess those acting classes I took with Laura in 5th grade are paying off...now is the time to reep (is that how you spell it?) the benefits! I got a 95 out of 100 and a 50 outta 50. Still, I hate the sound of my own voice...but doesn't everyone? I think I sound like a little girl. Maybe that just means I'm in touch with my inner child.  My cousin Leah (or, as my grandpa would say with his Jersey accent, 'Leer') burned me a cd of all her favorite Weezer songs. I have always known about Weezer, since I am for some reason drawn to 'Buddy Holly' glasses, and Rivers Como is always sporting them (which, I must say, is pretty dang HOTT!), but have never really heard many of their songs. I like 'What Everyone Wants' or 'American Girls' best, and I used to like 'Holiday in the Sun' until Mary Kate and Ashley tainted it for me (no offense Sarah!). Weezer is an odd name don't ya think? It got me pondering.   I want to sart a band....which will be hard since I have no musical talents and I am not particully inclined to acquire them (though guitar seems fun...but knowing me, my laziness and lack of concentration, chances of me learning are slim and nil.) It would be called 'A Stroke of Genius' and the first smash single's chorus will be 'It always rains or snows in 3rd hour'....   It be a kinda emo-ish, punk-pop sound. Since my plan will never be put into action, I am inviting anyone to take the name, but to just (please) make good music and sing about pocket protectors, Bill Gates and government conspiracies.   Those topics just fit the name don't they?  ...I have SO much homework to do...this will seriously get in the way of my procastinating.....
