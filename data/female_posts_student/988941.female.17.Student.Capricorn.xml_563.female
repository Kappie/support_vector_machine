The tour was not as good as Prague, probably something to do with the weather (or at least I can blame it on the weather). A very alone tour for me because I didn't have all that many people to talk to. When I wasn't pissing Jo and Donna off, or hanging around with the year 8/9s I was all by myself, which isn't fun for a week. So I got rather home sick, which I don't usualy get when I'm away. My photos come back in 3 days time, so I'll post 'em up then. I've text Nicki to see how she is, but no reply yet. Glad to be home.
