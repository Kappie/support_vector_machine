That was such a movie.. except EMILY doesn't know how to laugh at funny movies.. hehe.. She still thought it was funny tho. I just thought about it, but the commercials are way different then the accual movie.. weird. Today is the 4th of July.. very cool. I mean.. CONOG! haha.. what a cool word. Oh yeah.. add me on my new sn.. amiistu. So we just went to the Miller's and watched fireworks from their front yard.. yeah it was fun. Now we are here. Umm yeah..
