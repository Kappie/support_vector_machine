Did I really need a cheeseburger w/ a bun, corn on the cob, pasta salad, lettuce salad w/ thousand island, chips, pretzels, strawberry shortcake, and two non-light beers?  It's not even 6:00 and I've probably got room for something else.  I'm not counting the cold pizza I ate for breakfast.  This has got to stop!    As of Tuesday morning, I shall try YET ANOTHER DIET.  This time it will be the 'Candida diet'--nothing to do with Voltaire, believe me.  The list of acceptable foods is as follows:  --High fiber low starch vegetables such as: broccoli, celery, radish and asparagus. Plenty of fresh steamed veggies: especially onions, garlic, ginger root, cabbage and broccoli. Onions and garlic are very good anti-fungals.  --High protein foods such as: antibiotic free fish, fowl, nuts, seeds and eggs.   10% complex carbohydrate; rice, beans, millet, amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat.   --Fruit: papaya, pineapple, grapefruit and all types of berries. Other acceptable foods are sea foods and sea veggies, olive oil, eggs, mayonnaise, white rice, soy and vegetable pastas, white rice cake and crackers, some citrus fruit, herb teas and unsweetened cranberry juice.  Maybe I'll start tracking my (hopeful) weight loss weekly on this 'blog.  Kate has been doing this diet since December and has shed 15 lbs.
