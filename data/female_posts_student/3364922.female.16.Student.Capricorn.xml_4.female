It's now nine twenty-three and we still haven't heard not a sound not a whisper not a motor down the freeway. It's dark outside,  and cold What's a beautiful world?  Just give me my guitar and perhaps a tambourine or a book of lyrics. Lyrics of a dieing man who feels there is no time. Then let's see who's happy Now can you tell me, what's a beautiful world?  Face the day, awake the night Wear long sleeves to cover the wounds this is what a beautiful world can give. Look at the pretty colour on the edge of life.  Nine twenty-seven A last breath A shiver down the spine Drowned in murky waters Blood-edged knife Blood-edged life Now can you tell me, what's a beautiful world?
