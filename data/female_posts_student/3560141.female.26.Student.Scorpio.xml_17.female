Scene 1: Crawling out of bed, taking a millisecond look in the mirror to make sure no new blemishes have added themselves to the most despised list, walking past the box of Marlboros many times until I cave, say good morning to the Mercedes Mechanic guy who lives downstairs and probably thinks I spend every night obliterated, considering it's 9 AM and I'm smoking already...spend thirty minutes dancing like a monkey in the kitchen with my favorite roomie discussing how I'm cutting down, only to realize I have twenty minutes to either go the gym and be late to school or just be late to school, depending on the day I can be found on a treadmill, but I am consistently late to school.  Scene 2:  I am standing side by side with my partner who is equally as blank and shell-like, propped against a faux oil painting that juts into my back.  We nod a lot, and place our hands in our pockets, under our arms, on our chins like clockwork when the doctor faces us to translate the last twenty minutes that has just transpired.  It feels like being yanked on your big toe while in a deep sleep, aware but unwilling to acknowledge this disturbance.  Scene 3:  Interludes to translation:  Sex, lots and lots of sex, old experiences, potential ones, What am I gonna wear tomorrow?  Did I finish writing that paper, Did I get this guy to sign my attendance sheet, I wonder if my wireless card will work today, Do I need tomatoes?  Do my roomates mind beef tonight?  How many cigs have I smoked today?  Has anyone texted me?  Did that loan come through?  sex lots and lots of sex, I've tried to dilute this but really it's disgusting, Dr. B turns to tell us that his patient has been feeling fatigued and dizzy probably due to some sort of anemia, and I can't detach from the thought of him nuzzling his nose in my neck...please...not close anemia would seem more gripping at this point.  Oh...he...he will probably turn up in one of these blogs eventually...the scenarios aren't so explicit, it's more like I'm reaching for spices in my kitchen fiddling between the smoked paprika and the garlic salt, and I feel him behind me, I feel him behind me...His breath is hot and my hairs stand on end...ANEMIA, we can't ever cross this point in the fantasy, I'm way too focused on feeling him behind me and the whole breath description.  There are also flashes of a hood of a car..hmmm.. I wish I had more, but I've become bashful as I've written this...so, for now..ANEMIA
