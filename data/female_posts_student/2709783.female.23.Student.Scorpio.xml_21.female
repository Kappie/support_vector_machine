Going home lately has been really great, despite my gripes about the drive and the weather.  I've gotten to catch up with some folks that I probably neglected over the past few years, and it's nice to remember some people will let you desert them for a relationship they told you would not work and still love you when you come crawling back.    One of my best friends got married this weekend; he's the first of our group to actually tie the knot.  I felt like a mother hen all weekend, petting and cooing over my "baby boy" who had grown up.  The weekend was not without its comic moments, even though I think I cried like 3 separate times.  To begin with, the groom made the mistake of staying out very, very late the night before and wasn't feeling his best during the pre-wedding prep (the ceremony was at 1PM).  The bride was in similar shape.    This was probably a good thing, because it made them less likely to notice that the preacher botched the bride's name no less than three times.  It's not an odd name, not foreign, and I'm still not sure what the problem was.  Any awkwardness at the name episode was erased, however, by the cacophony of disposable cameras being advanced every time anyone moved.  It was deafening.  Later that night (Saturday) was when I got to catch up with the childhood crowd, which includes people I've known for 15+ years.  That was really enjoyable, and I hope I get to see them all quite a bit this summer before I flee the state.  Sunday I just couldn't bring myself to get ready and drive to Waco; Mom and I ended up driving out to a barn in our pasture that has 4 baby owls living in it.  I pictured cute, hooting, fluffy creatures.  Cute and fluffy they are, but I learned that when confronted with a human, owls don't hoot.  They are capable of making the most horrifying noise known to man, a giant hissing noise that is impossibly loud for such a small, fluffy thing.  It was like being in Jurassic Park, only instead of big, ugly dinosaurs, these adorable 6-inch birds were doing the soundtrack.    They are really cute, though, and I'm sure the hissing is actually their way of showing affection.  I didn't test this theory by trying to pet them, though, just in case it was wrong.  I like all ten of my fingers.  So after the owl-watching, it was much too late to drive back to Waco for the sole purpose of waking up and driving to Cleburne.  I slept at Mom's, got up at 4 and left the house at an hour that I used to come home at.  I kind of like having the roads all to myself because then I can spend my mental energy figuring out the meaning of life and whatnot instead of concentrating on driving.    This morning, my pondering included the following:  1.  I decided that the reason the coffee at the quick stop in Cross Plains is so good is that there is rust on the coffee pot, which gives it a unique flavor.  I'm not being facetious here, it's really tasty.  2.  I also examined the disturbing trend of female country singers bragging about how trashy they are.  I heard one song about being proud to be barefoot and pregnant, and another boasting about how much whisky the singer could drink.  Now, I'm not biased against rednecks; on the contrary, my own roots make me want to disprove the "uncultured" stereotype whenever I can.  But it does bother me that these songs are teaching an entire generation of young girls that they have to choose between swigging whisky at night and then enjoying a professional, educated life during the day.  No one should have to make that choice.  I think I'll contact NOW about it.  3.  When looking for an alternative station to the trashy women, I couldn't find any NPR.  That's probably related to the demand for it in the area I was driving through.  I did find a news show, though, which was very enlightening.  It was a discussion about gay marriage, and since the issue interests me, I tuned in.  Within 60 seconds, the host had referred to homosexuals as "aberrants" "misfits" and, my favorite, "angels of Satan."  I resorted to a CD and amused myself by counting the number of times Glen Rose businesses associate themselves with dinosaurs, even if there is no plausible relation between the two.  And here I am, wasting my lunch hour blogging.  While I was spending my weekend sleeping, eating and drinking, my first political hero passed away.  When I was younger, I was a gun-toting, freedom-loving conservative.  I saw Reagan as a larger-than-life figure, like Tom Landry or Davy Crockett.  After a few years of higher education, seeing a budget surplus disappear, and seeing friends fighting an unjust war, I have become a gun-toting, freedom-loving liberal.  I'm still sad about Reagan, if only because to me he represented an era of less animosity in politics.  He could joke and laugh and make people like him, even if they vehemently disagreed with his policies.  We've lost that today.  So here's to Ronnie, even though he ushered in the right wing as we know it.  It will be a long time before we see another class act like him.
