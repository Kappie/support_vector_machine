I say if we become anything, we shoudl do a cover albumn, and beat the shit out of Jessica Simpson for butchering Angel, which was a beautiful song, before she killed it trying to use her voice in a way she does not have enough power for.  Sorry you aren't Christina.   can you tell it bothers me?  "Save us from the wicked, shield our souls..."
