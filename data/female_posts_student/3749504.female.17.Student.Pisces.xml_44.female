I know he went on vacation and to golf camps and crap, but still :X he should get on more often. If he doesn't email me by the time he gets off, I'm going to  kick his ass . Hahaha.  Yesterday, walking along at the fair, Ashley asked me if I was going to go to Winter Formal and Prom next year. Uh, no, I told her. She asked me, "But what if Zach asks you?" I told her that was ridiculous and why would he ask me? "Because you guys are friends." Yea, but we are both friends with  other people  too, my world does not just consist of him. Yea, we do a ton of things together (during the school year) like movies, dinner, concerts, but that's different. We're not dating or in love with each other. We love each other, but as friends, of course. I'm just afraid my friends have gotten the wrong impression. Half of them have told me that me and him should get together, but it's just a friendship. FRIENDS.  I've gone on about this for too long :P anyways, to wrap up, am pissed off he hasn't emailed me lately, I'll probably call him later, and I'm glad he's not dead. But still pissed.
