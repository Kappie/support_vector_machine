YES GOTTA LUV THAT SONG. SO AWESOME hahaha. mrs graham got mad at us because she was trying to teach a class across the hall and yeah i guess the bass was up too loud and she was in a bad mood. oh well. her problem. blah. after that was socials class and we did nothign except watch Janelle draw cool drawings. her drawings are hilarious coz she donno how to draw. her drawing went from a demented looking guy having a ball thrown at his head to Bin Laden throwing a bomb at some guy pushing a cart. hilarious. so. a pointless day at school. i came home and then me, mom, jo,  zack went to the pool. it was fun. and then i went to church for vespers thingy and talked to terry. so. my day was great. boring/pointless but great. tomoro is church and im gonna be bored coz no one will be there. oh well. i have to do ppt tomoro for alicia. yay. time for bed. me tired. *yawnz*
