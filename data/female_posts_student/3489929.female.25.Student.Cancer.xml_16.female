Usually when I drink straight tequila- which, granted, is rare- I am down for the count the following day. Other than a pounding headache, though, I feel rather lucid.  I remember Lisa throwing one of her Ben-Wa balls- after use- at me (she was WAY more drunk than me, which is also rare). She said I threw it back and hit her in the shoulder. Ew. I can't believe I actually touched it (on a personal note, I tried putting my own in this morning as a test run, but for some reason, I could not get them to stay in there. And when they were in, they would not move. Aren't those little fuckers supposed to roll?!?!?).  FYI, for anyone who's interested. Getting drunk last night was NOT my idea. Yes, I paid for half the tequila, but then again, we barely finished half the bottle. I think I did 4 shots, Lisa 3 or 4, I can't remember. Plus I had a tubie. Yum yum.  I did get readmitted to MUW without a problem. And since I make a mere pittance at my job and my tax returns reflect that, I have to provide proof of last year's income to the school so I can get my aid package set up. And since I am a dumbass and did not make a copy of my tax return before mailing it in, I need to figure out how to get it so I can send it to the school. Any suggestions?  Why am I awake? I need more sleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
