Ordinarily you think you have fallen in love with a woman or with a man because she is beautiful , he is beautiful. That is not the truth. The truth is just the opposite: you have fallen in love because you cannot be alone. You were going to fall. You were going to avoid yourself somehow or other. And there are people who don't fall in love with women or men - then they fall in love with money. They start moving into money or into a power trip, they become politicians. That too is avoiding your aloneness. If you watch man, if you watch yourself deeply, you will be surprised - all your activities can be reduced to one single source. The source is that you are afraid of your aloneness. Everything else is just an excuse. The real cause is that you find yourself very alone." -  Osho .   Sometimes a week will go by, and nothing happens the way I want it to. That was my week last week: it was not joyous, nor fulfilling, nor beautiful. It was anxious and bizzare and very lonely. The events of the week soured and by Friday I felt fearful about what I would be up against for the weekend... It approached me slowly but surely like a giant hurricane... I waited for it to hit full force and destroy everything in my path. It was an odd feeling, like I couldn't wait until Monday. Is this strange? I had these terrible feelings that I could feel building up inside of me, boiling inside of me and this anxiety fell out of me in the form of beads of sweat on my nightly runs.  I have taken to a new addiction: running. I run everyday now. I run a lot, maybe too much for someone that just quit smoking, that hasn't been active for years... but I love to run. I run until I am red and sweaty, until I can't possibly run anymore, I run longer and harder each day. So, I was trying to figure out what it was that made me so obsessed with running and I realized it was the most amazing way for me to get out all of my aggression. For everything that makes me upset I just let it all out when I run... all the anxiety, all the stress, all the misery. Sometimes I just keep running because I tell myself it is for certain reasons. I'll think something like, "this mile is for the time he pissed me off," or "I'll sprint this hill just so you can't pidgeonhole me as some nerdy lazy scenester." It's like I am becoming a fuller person from pushing my body to the limits, it's some sort of weird relief, some sort of weird meditation.  So, I'll be running along, somewhere in the hilly roads of South Glastonbury, and the sky will be darkening and heat lightning lights up the sky... and I'll be feeling some sort of Zen, detoxing my body of anxiety and depression. I can think about the universe that unfolds in front of me over the horizon and I can flush out all the terrible emotions of the week and think about how everything happens for a reason instead. I'll be running along, and I'll picture life as this path, where everything happens for a reason. I've always believed everything happens for a reason, we are destined to make certain mistakes and to learn certain lessons. We are destined to meet certain people because they may give us love, or take love from us... we all learn something from it and run along to the next big event, the next set of fireworks in our lives...  I guess I'll just run and run like some sort of twisted dumb Forrest Gump and no more bad karma will ever be able to catch up me ever again.
