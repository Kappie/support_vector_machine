They don't seem to really capture the whole emotion, and I don't know if there are words that would.  I felt an uncontrollable fear inundate my veins when I was told that Anne Marie is planning JW's funeral.  The cancer is rapidly spreading through his brain stem, and doctors claim that there is no intervention possible--be it radiation or surgery.  In others words, everyone is losing hope; that is, everyone except the one person I most expected to drown in fear and hopelessness--JW himself.  He says that he still has hope, and that he is waiting for God to transcend His miraculous healing powers over him.  That just left me dumbfounded, that at this stage of regression in his illness, he is so optimistic.  I mean, that is totally an excellent mindset, and I don't mean to be pessimistic.  I've just tried to imagine what it would be like to be in his shoes--how I would feel and if I would exhibit the same relentless courage.  And sadly, I know I wouldn't.  I don't think I have it in me.   But who knows how I would feel if I was in the same situation.  I guess it's one of those things that you don't really know until you're there.  Situations like this one compels me to put things in my life into perspective, I mean, really relating petty ocurances in my life to the "grand scheme of things."  Most of the things that worry me, frustrate me, anger me, whatever me, are nothing compared to what JW and his family must be struggling with.  So I step back, take a deep breath, and look at things in a different light.  At least that's what I try to do.
