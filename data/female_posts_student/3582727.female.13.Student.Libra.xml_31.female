I really have nothing to do. Well, I  could  work on knitting that tank top that I haven't worked on for months, but... And I could continue reading  Dubliners , but... Blah. I just don't want to do a damn thing. So I guess I want school, if only because it'll give me something to do. Even if that something happens to be the last thing I'd choose to do if only I could.  Again, blah.  Fourteen days 'til school.
