I apear once on the entire web. Matthew wrote about me a year ago on his blog thing. So I decided it would be fun to get on the band wagon too. It probably will not last long, I don't have a tendency of be consistant in journal type things. But just for the heck of it I will write about my weekend, because it has been fairly exciting.  Friday: I took a phyics test and a World History finial. I was suppose to go to our school dance, but Julia wanted to hang out so I skipped the dance. She got lost and was 2 ours late, during that time I talked outside to my mom and dad. Dad had just got home from Canada. Instead I ate pizza and went shopping. I found the white-hooded-zip-up-long-sleaved-t-shirt I have been looking for 4ever! And I bought a pair of jean capris, that I haven't worn yet because it has been so rainy and cold. (apparently it rains whenever nate is in town so when he leaves for canada it will be sunny next week) then i came home and talked online to people.   Saterday: I was due to wake up at 10 and take a shower but my body is still on school time so I woke up at 645. AHHH!! So instead I got up and did laundary and looked at scholorships and took a bath while reading my book. Then I got dressed and found an unbrella and ate food my parents brought home for me. I then walked to the bus stop and was extreamly happy to find out the Nathan didn't stand me up. A dog was in the middle of the road and we thought that it was going to be ran over, as far as I know it didn't. Then the bus came and we went to the IDS building and sat on the bench and watched this amazing water fall. The water comes from the ceiling which is like 140 feet above you. It looks like if you stood under it it would be one of those personal rainshowers like they have in the cartoons. Then we went to the downtown Target and watched the cart escalators and went up and down the escalators too. It was like the country bumpkins go to the city.... then we went to a little bookstore and looked at all the dusty books. Nate was enthrawled by the books w/ unusual covers or margins. I thought it was really cool, I hadn't been to that kind of bookstore in a long time. Then we decided we were hungry and went to the food court in some downtown mall. The eating place was right by windows that looked down on the street. There was this one car who was trying to parallel park and just kept hitting the cars around it. First it'd back up into the Bug and the Bug was shake and then it would drive into the Honda and it was shake. Then it would back up into the Bug and so on. I was laughing so hard. Then we decided to go home and caught the bus. I came home and read my book and then went to the movie store where I saw my friend Lauren. She then came home with me and my fam + her watched Calander Girls. Good movie. Then we stayed up late chatting/ we read, I got tired feel alseep and she kept reading. Then the light was on all night. LOL.   Sunday: Got up went to church. Interesting sermon on the last part of James. Patience. Something I struggle with to no end. I don't have patience for annoying people, I don't have patience for times when I am not doing anything, I don't have patience with God (especially when it comes to relationships) I just struggle with that. Then fam + Lauren went to Khan's and I was told by the waiter I was "an expierenced vertrin at making my stir fry count". It was delish. THen we went home and watched Chasing Liberty (Mom, Lauren and I). THe sound went out in the middle so Lauren ended up fixing it. Then we headed off to the Ashworth's for Emily's grad party. Got beat up/made fun of by: Harrison, Alex, Mike, Larry, Lucius (sp??).... then the party got filled with family and Julia, Lynn, Lauren and I decided to go to a movie. Larry decided to come a little later. We went and saw Troy. Good movie, except I think my eyes were closed 50% of the time. And sense I am not a Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom fan it wasn't about seeing them as much. Then Lauren and I went back to St. Anthony only after screaming at cars going 45 in a 65 zoon. I went to bed. Monday: read my book, checked my email (why does no one write me?) and did a Pristah like thing and looked up my name on the net. Found Matt's blog thing and the rest is history. So here was my weekend, not as boring as today will be, but oh well.
