Well,I guess this blog has seen about 75% of my true character--which is a lot more than the rest of the world sees, so feel privledged. But anyway, this is my handwriting analysis results. It's funny because the vast majority of it doesn't quite line up with my character. But what do you expect, it wasan    online   handwriting analysis. By the way...I really   ♥ love ♥   this new html color thing :)      Here are the results:    Regarding letter size... you clicked "Medium". Because your writing is neither really large or small, then we know you are not as intense as those who write really small... nor are you as flighty as those on the other extreme. You fall into the middle-of-the-road on this character trait.    Slant reveals "emotional outlay". (How you react emotionally to the situations with which you're faced.) And Concerning the letter slant of your sample, you chose "Vertical". You use logical, sound judgments to make decisions. You're ruled by your head, not your heart. You tend to be calm, cool, and collected... and are good under pressure. In a situation where other people might get hysterical, you have poise.        Some may see you as "detached" or "unemotional". It's not that you don't feel emotions, you just have more discernment when and with whom to express your inner-most feelings. You also keep them inside longer than most people. (If your writing is very large, you can be very social, friendly, and talkative... but still emotionally logical.)  The first time someone makes you mad, you probably won't say anything. But, you'll mentally put a mark on the wall and keep your mouth shut until they piss you off again. Then, BOOM! You'll explode... all that pent-up anger comes pouring out! And, you won't feel any regret at all, because you know they deserved it.    This may sound harsh, but you're ruled by self-interest. In emotional situations you ask yourself, "What's best for me?" And, unlike many of us, you actually have the discipline to follow your logic... rather than your emotional whims.        In a relationship, you tend to show your affection by the things you DO rather than the things you SAY. The only exception is if your mate has expressed a need to hear "I love you" on a daily basis, then out of respect for your partner's needs, you'll verbalize your feelings.  Looking at the letter "i", you chose "i-dot is just about normal". This is a good trait to have, because it shows loyalty... a solid commitment to stand by those people or ideals in which you truly believe.    Oh boy... the letter "o"... this is a very insightful letter. When you picked "Exit loops on the right side", that told me you can be VERY secretive. As a matter of fact, the larger your inner loop, the more you tend to avoid giving complete and straight answers. You won't lie, but you won't offer information freely either. If your best friend shows up in an outfit that's absolutely hideous, and then asks your opinion, you might say something like... "How unique! Where did you get it?"        Excellent! When I asked about the shape of the tops of the humps in the letters "m" and "n", you chose "Vary between rounded and pointed". Your represent the best of two types of reasoning styles: The "cumulative" and the "comprehensive". You can process information both in a cumulative/procedural fashion... and also in a comprehensive/fast manner. The cumulative thinker likes to take the time to gather all the facts before forming a conclusion. On the other hand, the comprehensive thinker likes to see the big picture... without getting too deep into the details, and quickly form his/her conclusion. Because you can process information in both a cumulative/procedural fashion... or in a comprehensive/fast manner, you can easily adapt to the situation at hand. If you're with a cumulative thinker, you can slow down and explain every detail. If you're talking to someone who only wants the bottom-line, you can speed up your thinking, and shorten your presentation. This ability is critical to effective leadership.  This is an important trait! When I asked you how high the t-bar is crossed on the stem of the letter "t", you chose "Midway up the stem". This tells me that you set goals that are realistic, practical, and obtainable. Also, that your self-esteem is good... but not so high as to make you over confident.    People that cross their "t's" in the upper middle are pragmatic and secure with themselves. You have the confidence necessary to make changes in your life that would improve your situation. Keep growing and stretching!        When I asked you if the first letter of your signature was smaller than, or equal in size to the other letters, you indicated that it was. This shows that you have a tendency to be modest and humble. You prefer to blend into the crowd... rather than stand out. This isn't necessarily a bad trait. However, ego is an important component of your self-image. So don't always take a back seat!.  People with larger capital letters in their signature tend to demand more attention and have a stronger sense of self-importance. There are times when this is appropriate and very important.    You checked that your signature was underlined. This shows that you are both self-reliant, and yearn to lead others. You aren't afraid to draw attention to yourself and take charge. You have confidence in your own abilities and inner strength. Hats off to you!
