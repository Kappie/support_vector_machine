I recently applied to a Entry Masters in Nursing Program (ELMSN) and I just got a call from I guess one of the counselors. I have not completed all of my prerequisites yet but I do plan on doing so before I attend that is if I even get in. However most of the classes that I have not completed are Science courses and that is the main part. So now I have to figure out how I am going to complete some of them before they begin reviewing my application. I have to get into this program. This is my future as well as my children's. I have a back up plan if I don't but I know I didn't waste $50 to not get into this expensive A#! program. Okay I got that off my chest.
