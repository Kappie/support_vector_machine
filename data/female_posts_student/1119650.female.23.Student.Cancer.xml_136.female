There were six crazy characters whom I loved in my youth Alexander the Grape, Strawberry Short Kook, Louie-Bloo Raspberry, Sir Isaac Lime, Poncho Punch and Little Orphan Orange.  All equally as tasty, all equally as intriguing.  I decided to look further into the Otter Pop story and I present you the following links of ottery goodness:   urlLink Otter Pop HQ : Perhaps the greatest bastion of Otter Pop knowledge.  In-depth assesments of each othe Pop personalities, war strategies, journal entries, games, experiments and art work.  Sadly, it has come to my attention that my most beloved pop, Strawberry Short Kook, has a drug problem.  Check it out: "The shortest member of team Otter Pop, Strawberry Short Kook is beloved by all for the adorable "pickles" she gets herself into. Like not being able to reach the top shelf. Or overdosing on quaaludes. It hurts her when the other Otter Pops call her shorty, but she laughs anyways, because she has her art and a crate that makes her less short. Probably the most popular of all the Otter Pops, mostly because of her refusal to wear any sort of shirt."  Stop picking on her, you bastard Otters!!  **this site is pretty much the pinnacle of Ottery entertainment, the rest I just found in Google**   urlLink Otter Pops that didn't make it  some are quite funny.  Better than the one at OPHQ cuase this one has pictures.  Simpletons like me loves us some pictures.   urlLink The Otterpops (a band)  go check out the site for the now defunct band, the Otterpops   urlLink Raphael's Rant on why Otter Pop Shots Ruined his life.    urlLink The Otter Pop shot, as referenced above.      This entry was dedicated to the masutrbating otter at the Boston Aquarium.
