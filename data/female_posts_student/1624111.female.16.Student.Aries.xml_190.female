I dont understand how she can pass up being with all of us even if it means she has to spend time with michele and it has to be on her birthday. suck it up, martha. shes not evil. shes your friend. be nice. -the olivia/martha stuff. Calm down, olivia. you won't get invited to every party you want to be invited to. It doesnt mean she doesnt like you. You're not her best friend and she could only invite so many people. dont be so offended.  -Olvia or was it kara? when olivia had marshmallow on her pants and im like "what is that, marshmallow?" and shes like "no, its semen...or is it marshmallow? taste it and find out" and im like "how am i supposed to know what semen tastes like?" and karas like "Ask a guy" and then someones like "no, ask emily, she should know, right?" ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! gross. thats worse than suggesting shes...been doing that. because then youre going farther to say that shes...in...her mouth...ewwww. *cringe* not my pure, sweet, innocent emily! noooooooooo -bobby when he called emily a whore and i kicked him and he told me im too posessive and its creepy. shut up, bobby. i didnt like your tone, alright? i know you werent serious, but it was weird and you dont know her well enough to joke about it knowing for sure that shed never do it, so don't say anything. and expect me not to...uh..."defend her honor" -Bobby and Olivia teasing me and telling me to go run up to emily and greet her when she came back from babysitting. "Go. Go. Run, you know you want to. its so hard to resist." Shut up, guys. I guess i dont mind olivia so much because i get the feeling she likes to tease me, but she still respects me and how i feel about Emily. But bobby...i dunno...i dont get no respect from him. He just doesn't understand... not that anyone really does, and i dont expect them to...but...i dunno, whatever. leave me alone, alright? do i love her? yes. was i glad she came back? yes. did i want to talk to her right away? yes. am i going to run up to the car and make a fool of myself? mmm...i think you gotta pick the kind of stuff youre gonna be crazy about like that. Run after her when she's coming to talk to you anyway? Run after her when kara's already doing it? Run after her in front of a bunch of people who know we're friends but don't know the specifics? Run after her when im fairly content about Emily things and i just got to see her and im gonna get to see her for another few hours? mmm... i dunno if thats quite hte running-after set up. After APs, however...yeah. I did run after her then. But thats cause she was walking away, no kara or anyone else, i wasn't gonna get to talk to her until monday, probably... i wanted to know how the test was for her and what questions she did...we had just finished the hardest class of the year and part of her aps were over and part of her free time restored and that means more time for me and of course im happy about that. and its an empty hallway and i didnt have anywhere to be for a while. i dunno, theres a difference. i dunno why the bobby/olivia thing bothered me so much... just dont make fun of me for something i care a lot about, k?  Things to be happy/amused about: -michele didn't find out! hahahaha. we have a secreto. jajaja. -67 notes! -i burned for emilylessness and related feelings/issues. that felt good. -riding in Emilys car when she pulled in. hehe. -talking with heather who i never see anymore -nice summer weather  Just...things: -my dreams...and the emily-hugging business. really gotta get to that. before i explode.or forget about it.  -Feffer -Hal   mmm...i get distracted and run out of things to say. good news is that tomorrow when i get bored...i can drive!!!!  where should i drive first? i cant decide.
