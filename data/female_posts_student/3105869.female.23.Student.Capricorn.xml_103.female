What do you do, when you are trying to explain why someone was out of line and the other person is so intent on not being at fault for an obvious lapse in judgment, that they refuse to listen and lash out verbally.  I can´t concentrate since it happened and someone is just not listening.  There is such a marked difference from listening and hearing, its the difference between apathy and empathy.  I am in a weird situation now, I´m going to Rome on the 11th with two people I now feel awkward around.  What do I do?  Life actually really sucks for me anyway and its not getting any brighter.  I was studying last night with Karen late, after having dinner with the St. Mary´s crowd and Dean Piatt.  I went outside had a couple of café con leches to keep me going and after studying there awhile went up to the mezzanine to study, but the young woman who works at the front desk said she had to turn the lights off at 12 am, as per request of manager.  So all 10 of us were kicked out.  This was the first time i wasn´t abudantly prepared and all this took place while I feel crushed inside.  So I told Dean Piatt at breakfast today and he asked our debtor creditor prof to have mercy that we had tried but couldn´t finish because we had gotten the boot.  But, to no avail, Prof Maloy barrelled throug the reading and since so many had skipped he would call names from the cards of the students in class.  I will give you one guess who had tried to finish, but was cut off by the front desk lady, and was the last case to be called on to recite.  Nobody had gotten that far, but I was too afraid to say I hadn´t gotten that far.  So, I winged it.  I made sure my voice was steady and spoke loudly slowly and clearly and I actually did a good job.  That was my first time of winging it.  I told Dean Piatt after class in case I got docked for doing a shoddy job, but Maloy came up to me and said I had done an excellent job.  I B.S.ed my way through, but he doesn´t know, thank GOD.  Dean Piatt said congrats, now I am ready for court.  He laughed, obviously amused by my residual terror over a case.  I am just sad right now, I don´t like the things I need to be stable amidst this turmoil to run afoul.  F%$ the weekend, it feels like monday.
