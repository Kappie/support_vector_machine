You can't buy them jewellery unless you're willing to spend a fortune on a piece of string in Hard Edge or some other rip-off shop. You can't buy them chocolate, because even thought they may like it, guys just don't eat chocolate like girls do! You can't buy them CD's 'cos you never know if they've already got it or if they're gonna like it. Unless, of course, you ask them, then they know what they're getting. Yo ucan't buy clothes 'cause you never know if they will fit, or if they'll even like it. And decent clothes these days are expensive. You can't buy underwear, because you just can't! See, I can buy underwear for my girly friends, but you can't just buy underwear for guys. That's silly! You can't buy make-up, 'cause guys don't wear make-up.    See, I think my point is proven...   However, I have made a shortlist of things I'm gonna get him... including guitar picks, an Iron Maiden poster and a big bag of Softmints (he asked for the picks!).    Lol, so if anyone knows what you buy for a 15-year-old guy, then pleeease tell me 'cause I'm very, very, very stuck!       Peace,
