If I bartend and make at least $50-150 per shift, averaging $125 per shift (4 shifts) per week, I will have a monthly net income of $2000.  If I stay here and work once a week, or more, I could bring home $250+ a month.  If I make less bartending any given week, I could work an extra shift here.  There is room for error because I'm not including my paycheck from bartending because I don't know how things work in that area.  Either way, I'm pleased with my calculations.   I called this 800 number for bartending.  It's called bar careers and it's much cheaper than any bartending college ($90).  They teach you to make 50 drinks (I can't make any) and you're guaranteed employment.  Plus you get to keep the tools for an additional $30.  No extra charges, unless you relocate and would like help finding a new job bartending.  Even then it's $10/mo.  Sounds good to me.  The only thing that weirded me out was that the guy I spoke to the first time was the same guy that answered the phone the second time.  This leads me to believe it's probably basement based.  Oh well.  Health related: I'm anemic.   I'm shaking. I've been bitten by at least 9 creatures.  Or one that's hell bent on my demise.   The areas are red.  I'm black, no part of my person should be red.  At any time.   My contacts are about 2 months older than they should be.   I have a serious smoke related cough that's causing my chest to ache. My nose is stuffy. My throat aches.   It's not a cold though.  I don't get colds more than once every few years. I was lightheaded this morning.   And I've been gaining a lot of weight.  And it's not because of the suzy Q's and the Thai food and the ice cream and cake and pigs in a blanket and burger king and mcdonalds and wendy's and taco bell and pizza hut and candy bars and hot tamales and just about anything else horribly unhealthy you can think of.  It's genetics, man.  I can't fight it.    Romance related: N/A  Fast track to stardom: ...coming soon...  No-sing else, I donut think.
