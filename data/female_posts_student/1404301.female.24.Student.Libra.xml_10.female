We are looking forward for her to arrive as we have prepared a little surprise...well, I don't think I will tell you what it is but I can give you some clues: it is something that you eat, that is really australian and it has a bit of history - let me tell you...  During WWII, when the Australians were fighting away from home, the wife of the soldiers could only send this "Maud's surprise" to them because it could still be good after a very long trip...Now the Australians gave it a very famous name but I won't tell you what...  If you can't wait to find the answer, ask Bernadette, she should remember...
