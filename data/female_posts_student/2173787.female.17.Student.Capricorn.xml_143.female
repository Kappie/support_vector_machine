I've been telling my dreams to the scarecrow About the places that I'd like to see I say, "friend do you think I'll ever get there?" Oh, but he just stands there smilin' back at me So I confessed my sins to the preacher About the love I've been prayin' to find Is there a brown-eyed boy in my future, yeah And he says, "girl, you've got nothin' but time."  But how do you wait for heaven? And who has that much time? And how do you keep your feet on the ground When you know that you were born, You were born to fly  My daddy he is grounded like the oak tree My momma she is steady as the sun Oh, you know I love my folks But I keep starin' down the road Just lookin' for my one chance to run Hey, cause I will soar away like a blackbird I will blow in the wind like a seed I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams And I will grow up where I wander wild and free  Oh, How do you wait for heaven? And who has that much time? And how do you keep your feet on the ground When you know, that you were born? You were born, yeah, you were born to fly  So how do you wait for heaven? And who has that much time? And how do you keep your feet on the ground When you know, that you were born You were born to fly, yeah  You were born to fly, fly, fly, fly, hey Oh, oh -Sara Evans   Born To Fly   Just for the record...Doesn't have to be a brown eyed boy in my future, I don't discriminate by eye color!
