Oh my gosh! All hail Roger! Phew~! LoL~! Brian left a little earlier but yeah. Talked to him about stuff. Got it all figured out now. ^^  Rog is pretty down about Can but yeah. I'm sure he'll be okay. :)  Got home and signed onto MSN. Left myself on AWAY while I was in the shower. Came back and saw a few messages from Nima. Checked my email. Got an email from him that said some pretty sweet stuff. ;) He told me he blogged (wow... thats rare!) and I read his blog too. Very strange. Not like him to send me an email AND blog! Blah, whatever. Stuff in the blog and yeah... maybe we'll be able to talk about it tomorrow if not, then whatever.   Didn't think I'd have time to blog but my sister is talking to my mom about some Integrity Team so muahahaha! I'm such a bad girl.  Wow, band practise is past coolness! We practised the song I wrote and it was total coolness! The chorus was soo much fun! ^^ I can't talk properly now! Hehe~  Hmm, went back on MSN but Nima's off so I signed out again. Whatever. Going to bed. Peace.
