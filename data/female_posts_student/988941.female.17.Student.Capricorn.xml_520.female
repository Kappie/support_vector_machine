I never did go to the garden centre because I went to Jackie's house instead and went on her dance mat. I cannot do it at all!!! I get all confuzzeled. While I was doing the lessons Jackie was whooping at some kids in their paddling pool. Hmm. Anyone guess what Jackie will be when she is older...... LOL. Jokes.
