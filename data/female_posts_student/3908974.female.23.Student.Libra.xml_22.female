It's less than 90 miles away, and I've been here twice in two weeks fucking around with a loan my dad's co-signing for me.  He's off playing poker, and I've been on the computer so long I'm about to go blind.  Had kind of a strange night, followed by a pretty intense morning.  I had a visitor.  We went to my girlfriend's place and drank red wine and played Scrabble and listened to a record she made with her boyfriend.  I wore her purple feather boa and smoked white cigarettes in a Marilyn Monroe sort of way.  She brings out the silly girly side of me.    Had this really soul searching conversation with my friend who stayed over at my apartment last night.  Which was a little odd because we were at this breakfast place where most people just sip coffee and talk about sports.  All of the sudden it kind of dawned on me...I think he might still be a little besotted, which means 1) He is not a fruit.  2)  It will be hard to be friends.  Which really makes me sad.    Now I'm going to visit an old time friend, one who has also had issues with liking me the wrong way.  I'm not some great beauty, nor do I have a particularly magnetic personality.  I have come to the conclusion that friendships between men and women are always complicated, as much as it's possible to ignore it.  No exceptions.  But I guess everything else, i.e. common interests and interesting conversations, and the vital objective POV of a 'just friend' can trump crushy feelings.    Other than that--It's been a cool sunny day, and mushrooms are dotting the ground, and I ate a waffle for breakfast, and I burned some cd's for my sweetheart, and now I am going to go drink some nice cold beers with my friend and talk about politics.  And then I am going to drive on home and write a story.  Life is good, even if some things about it are kind of complicated.
