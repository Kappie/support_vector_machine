Night one, it was raining very heavily, with all the thunder and lightening and girls' screaming too. So one or two tents collapsed and the FA (faciliators) had to get all of us out. It was a funny sight, a big group of people wearing yellow raincoats running for shelter. Each time there was a lightening flash, people will squat down halfway running, and yeah...screams. So we all got soaked wet and cold.      Day 2 at Ubin was kinda interesting. We had to use skills learn to find clues using a map and a compass. We were the second group to reach, even though we were stuck for very long on the 2nd clue. The mosquitoes at Ubin are    vicious   !! Thank goodness there was an insect repellent, or i might have had more bites. After we finish the trekking, we went to the mamam beach for lunch. We cooked ourselves and erm.. it was kinda disgusting.. haha. Apple was still the best!      Night two, the best night ever. We stayed up for very very long to play games in the guys room. We played indian poker and a game called    ti tu tiu   . haha... it was damn fun. indian poker was a lot of sabo-ing, and loser had to drink bottles of water which accumulated every round. Titu tiu... haha.. what more can i say.Itwas   The Game    of the camp.Now we have a Ti Tu Tiu club, with a president and vice president.. haha..      Day 3, we went to the ELF outdoor area. They have things like flying fox etc.. kind of fun. Alot of group work.. my group may not have won, but it was still very fun. After that we went to pack our tents and went for lunch. The best lunch of the camp - at SAA. Had things like curry puffs, spring rolls, fried rice, PROPERLY cooked bee hoon, chilli fishballs etc. The finale was of coz another few rounds of Ti Tu Tiu!       Cant wait for tmr where there is going to be Memory Lane for the camp.    Cant wait to play Ti Tu Tiu again with those ppl!
