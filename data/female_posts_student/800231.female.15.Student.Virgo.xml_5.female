So we attempted to make a soy omelet this morning. So twelve eggs and a pound of Soy cheese later, we know we're complete failures in life. Seriously, Theo, Janet and I all brought in the ingredients before school and went up to the cooking room. Theo is the only member of our group that can actually cook anything at all. Unfortunately, he refused to cooperate because "soy is bad". So after telling Janet and I the basics of making an omelet he stood back to watch. It took ten minutes and the help of another guy before we could even get the bloody gas stove on... I told you we sucked. Anyway,to make a long story short, we burned it and spent the rest of the day warning people not to eat it.  I have my aerobics final tomorrow, sounds amazingly stupid but its  really  hard for me. Bah.  I was released from my ceramics final a hour and a half early, I should've just gone home but I had plans with someone later so I decided to stick around until classes were over. God, its so boring just lurking around in the halls after class. I was sitting on the steps on the east landing when some random teacher sat down next to me. He was very confused to say the least. The first thing he asked me was where he was. Then he asked me if he could leave soon, when I told him I didn't know he just sat there and stared at his watch. LOL, I hope he was a sub. When I finally got up a few minutes later he said "bye" quite amicably and last I checked he was still sitting there staring at his watch.  A while later I caught up with Steph and Casey who apparently left class. They were lurking around the pop machines in the gym hall trying to scrounge money off people. Steph has been absent so much this quarter the she has to appeal for credit. That involves getting a paper signed by all your semester teachers saying you actually worked while you were there. Only problem was, the papers were due into the attendance office yesterday and Steph still had hers. The last teacher she needed to sign it was her band teacher Mr. S so we spent 10 minutes tracking him down and eventually found him in the AC hallway. Anyway, Steph ran up to him and started the heavy duty begging for credit.  "Please? If I fail my daddy will kill my doggy and then he'll kill me and I'll hold you personally responsible!" Mr. S just stared at her, but he finally agreed to sign it. Then no one had a pen. I managed to find the last working pen in my bag after ages of looking and handed it to Steph. "I love you Angela!" Mr. S turned to look at me. "I love you too! Wait... I don't know you. But, I'm sure I love you anyway!" LOL, this made me laugh, I don't know why...  Helen just got a tutoring positition at my old middle school. Problem is, Helen never went to my middle school and its an   extremely  confusing place to get around in. It isn't built like any normal building I've ever seen, anyway I've promised to go with her on her first day to help her out. The last time I was there was last September when I went to visit some teachers that I still consider friends. Anyway, this'll be fun! I've always loved that place...
