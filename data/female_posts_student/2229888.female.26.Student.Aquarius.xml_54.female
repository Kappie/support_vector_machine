Yeah, it's a trailer... eighty five dollars a week...  a monstrosity on the outside (either it's a trailer or some old dinosaur laid a big turd and let it bask in the sun until it faded) But you know what? It's a place of our own.  and that feels pretty damn good...  I'll admit that I feel ashamed to live in a trailer, but i don't think i  should     feel ashamed! I don't have alot of money, and i do have a baby... and this old hunk of metal is warm and I'll make it cozy inside...  There's alot of work to do. The carpets are filthy and it smells like dog and cigarettes... I'm grabbing a steam cleaner, vacuum, Febreeze, and BLEACH GALORE... this place will look just fine when I'm finished with it!  The electricity is powered by a plastic box on a wall...  you have to swipe an ATM-like card through it... we have to drive about 30 mins away to get to the building that charges it... we put 10 or 20 bucks on the thing then driiiiiiiiive home and swipe power into the trailer!  it's weird... i've never seen anything like it before...  we've had a shitty day... since it's saturday we can't turn the power on, and i am stuck at my mother-in-law's house...  it's not that bad here, and my M-I-L is pretty cool most of the time (except on full moons and any time i'm not doing what she wants me to), but her husband (who is ALWAYS nice to me) is pretty pissed at her for allowing us to stay... he only shows it when i'm not looking, but i  know ...  Im cold as hell... wait a sec... cold as ICE... that's better...  my toes are froze and my fingers are popsicles...   Sky's okay, though, I have him wrapped up tight and i hear him snoring away as i tap away at the keyboard... the heat is on (that's a song, right? brings forth visions of eddie murphy and his donkey laugh) but it's only warm within a 3 foot radius of the heater... BRRRRRRR!
