I am a rather interesting person... with a lot of random nothingness to say... but it's random and there's a lot of it... if I make any sence.  I think that every town (with a lake, swimming pool, hot tub, or maybe even bath tub) should start a PBSDC, Polar Bear Skinny Dipping Cult. If you don't know what I'm talking about then I'll fill you in... Polar Bear ~ early morning swim Skinny Dipping ~ naked Cult ~ eh a different sort of a club! Now, early morning also works late at night... such as 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. before you actually make it to sleep.  Best recomended if it's coed, it's funner that way.  None the less... I worship the color pink, high heels, young grasshoppers, and wise sea urchins! I am also a closet spicy cheeto junky, who is obsessed with Maine, but in all fairness I have a right to be. I'm not sure what the right is... but it's there. Sexual induendos are the most intertaining thing.  Expessally if you don't mean to say them and try to fix them and they keep getting worse and worse, expessally if you are sitting on a guy massaging his back without a shirt on. ^^ For any of you who have a big group of friends (coed) and get really bored, you should play strip 31.  It's a very interesting game! I don't feel like explaining it though. Well I must depart into the land of jumping tupac clowns.
