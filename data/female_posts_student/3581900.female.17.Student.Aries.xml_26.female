Finish your job and get the heck outta here!"  Apparently I had passed out and didn't finish cleaning the place up. Yup, this is where I work. It's all that I've got. It's all that I've come to remember, nothing else gives me hope...  Hope for something... someone... not anyone... just her. It's where we first met, maybe we'll meet again?  Bah, what am I saying... this alcohol must be getting to me... I should finish cleaning up ...
