That was sooo weird...yep..my mission for 2004 is to learn guitar..i wanna write me own songs and play them too. I have soo much free time i can teach myself but dad's gonna teach me how. Fact: Avril Levign taught herself how to play guitar when she was 13! so did my dad and he bought his first guitar for $13 lol so if they could do it so can I! lol
