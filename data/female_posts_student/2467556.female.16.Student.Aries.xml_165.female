I went over to Nadia's house around 7:45pm to watch the first 2 episodes of I love the 90's....90 and 91!  It was pretty awesome.    Tuesday: work, then me and Lauren's last hurrah before she moves to Atlanta.  We tried on prom dresses and messed around.  Then we saw King Arthur....i would advise everyone who does not want to either die of boredom or laugh hysterically at stupid parts or yell at the desecration of the king arthur story not to see it.  Its 2 hrs of me and Lauren's lives we can't get back.  Then we went back to my house and said our goodbyes....I LOVE YOU LAUREN AND I CAN'T WAIT TO VISIT YOU IN ATLANTA!!!  haha everytime i go to visit her, i'm going to be singing that rap song "Welcome to Atlanta" by Jermaine Dupri and that other guy lol.   Wednesday: work, taped I love the 90's and then BROOMBALL!!!!  Everyone remember the last time i played goalie in hockey and my knees were black and blue and i couldn't bend them? And remember how i had to wear an Ace bandage on my left knee because it hurt so bad to bend/touch anything?  Yup, it happened again when i played goalie in broomball....except this time its my right knee that has to wear the bandage and my butt is badly bruised too so it hurts to get up. I made some goos saves, but i let in 2 goals (i think) and one of those was the tying goal.  Our team lost but we played the better game, we had a 3-0 lead for an HOUR AND A HALF and then they scored a goal and then in the last 15 mins they came back.  Luckily their winning goal was not scored on me, i couldn't bend my knees anymore, so i took myself out.  They scored on darrell instead.  We still rocked.   woohoo i get paid tomorrow! yes! money!  hmmm it seems like everyone is going to that relient k concert tomorrow....i didn't have enough money to go *tear*....  alright i'm out, my knees are killing me.  I hope they turn out as gruesome as last time!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
