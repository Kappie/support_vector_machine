Usually i hate driving, only because i still have my permit and therefor must drive with one of my parents, and both like to yell at me when i do something wrong. Or even when i don't for that matter. It sux. Well, with grandpa it was so much better. He explained things to me, he didn't yell or get mad. It was so cool! Once we got home it was about 11:30, and i had to be at the highschool around 12:45 for our drumline rehearsal. Also, before i left i had to make pizza dough, so when i got home around 5 i could just roll out the dough, slap on the toppingsd and away we go. Well, between the dough, loading up my quads, putting away the paint for the drums, and saying goodbye to my little siblings, i was almost late. I made it there just after our section leader did, though. I felt special. Anyways, i had forgot to put sunscreen on before i left, and there was no shade around. It was about 103 outside during the rehearsal. Not fun. It did cloud over for a little while, but not long. Actually, for about 15 minutes we hung out in the dugout. That was fun. We played and marched, and marched and played until 5. I got home, made dinner, welcomed my older sister home, and that would bring us to this point. Yup, i've had a really fun day. The only thing that would make it better is if i could see, or at least talk to, my boyfriend, but he's out hangin with his friends. That's ok. I'll talk to him on monday hopefully. Well, my grandma's leaving, so i'm gonna go. Laterz all. Keep on keepin on.
