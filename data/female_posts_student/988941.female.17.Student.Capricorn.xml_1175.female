I watched Veritas: The Quest last night on the Sci Fi channel and its such a good program. Wooo. I learned alot geology wise because its all about taht kinda thing. lol. Bit late now though.  At the end of the day once I am back from work I will be removing Jo from the member list unless she blogs so lets think up the next person to invite to join our blogging. Its up to you three so lets hear your ideas. Now that exams are over we can carry on with the weekly debate type o thing so  Tom  you may post Mondays question / subject.
