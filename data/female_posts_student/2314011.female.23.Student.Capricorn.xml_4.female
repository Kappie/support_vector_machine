My dental hygenist was in a playful mood and that's always a good thing.  She's my friend Mike's mom, so we chatted about him and his adventures abroad in Ecuador.  He's supposed to teach his mom how to say "Shut the fuck up" in Spanish when he returns so she can throw down on the days her coworkers feel the need to belt out Tim McGraw tunes in the office.  Laurie's (that's  her name) good people, she knows I don't ever floss and doesn't judge me.    Then pounded out a three hour Torts practice exam, which I think I did pretty well on.  Yay.  Decided I deserved a break from studying around 3 and indulged in mid-day network programming.  Finally got off the couch around 930.  Yea, felt pretty guilty about not working on Property stuff, but not guilty enough to pull me away from back-to-back episodes of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy followed by Roseanne on Nick and Nite....god I miss cable!!!  But really, I haven't had a "just lay around watching bad day time TV" day in a long damn time and damnit...I deserved it!  Property can wait!  It's during the last week of finals, anyway.  Have to admit, though, did start feeling a bit zapped after awhile, and maybe a bit creatively blocked after not writing any pages at all for a day.    Was wondering how Amy would decide a case involving an Omish (?) girl's custody battle with the baby's "English" teenage father on CBS's riveting family court drama when Dad stopped by the couch to ask if I'd join him for a visit down at the grandparents' house.  Decided that was as good an excuse as any to get away from the machine's dangerous rays and went on down.  So yea, the old folks have decided to move into a newer, smaller place and I have very mixed feelings about the whole situation.  And by mixed I mean bad, sad and generally resentful.  Well okay, not resentful so much as already missing the old house next door to my elementary school.  I mean, it's Grandma's and Grandpa's House for crying out loud!!  This was the house I memorized my first book in!  How can we not be having Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners there anymore?  Thursday's will be the last official dinner in the homestead, so being there tonight was a good preparation for the big goodbye.  Regaled them with stories of meeting Justice Ginsburg this fall and the treacherous ride home last week.  Heard stories of young turkeys raised in the basement and barn, scouring the summer fields for choice grasshoppers, only to be slaughtered in the fall, and Peggy the cow with an amputated leg.    So tomorrow's the big shopping day with Mom.  Already fitting the armor and working out thoughtful, calm responses to anything and everything she may try to slip in under the radar.  Not sure if it'll come to blows, but I'm gonna be strong, by god!    Suppose I could use my favorite new line for situations such as these; used it on Dad tonight when he was grumbling about killing a stray cat on the grandparents' driveway.    "Right?" was his inevitable end to the mumbled tirade.  I simply said "I'm not engaging," and left it at that.
