All I ask, and i think Abby will agree with this, is that you express you concerns, not attack the person.  Also I believe that Abby just didn't want to have to deal with school here and at school, she wasn't attacking you, as your reaction would show, but just reacting against school. (by the way its The Souls of Black Folk: Forethought;  Chs  1-5;  Chs  8-10;  Ch  14;Up from Slavery: pgs 1-50 (Chap 1-6)  and Ch 14 , if you're going to give her assignments at least give her the right ones)   Abby, I'm not really sure how to, or even if you need to, calm you down.  Rosie has backed off on her anti-Michael campaign, and if her reaction (to basically nothing) seems overworked, it's probably not you, it's probably something else.  so... if that covers it all, go back to you lives citizens  PS Rosie, if you really feel the need to get mad at someone, why don't you get mad at someone you communicate better with.
