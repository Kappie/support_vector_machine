But you will have the ability to respond to entries just like I do with the Golden Sushi guestbook.  I'm kind of busy with job searches right now, but if you want it, just let me know.. I will install it for you on Sunday.    If the webcam is the same size that I use in Golden Sushi, it should not make the page load longer.  You can download the Webcam 32 software at the same place that you downloaded the WS_FTP software.    P.S. I fixed your archives to the way you like it already.  Let me know what you think of it.
