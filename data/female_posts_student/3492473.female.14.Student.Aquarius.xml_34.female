I wrote like ten different beginnings. Being honest,   I didn't expect it to be this hard.   I really wanna get a head start on writing it and be done by the time I'm out of high school but it seems like it's gonna take so much longer! Go figure. Well, listen to this! All year in algebra I've gotten B's. The B in the first quarter was such a shocker because in 5th grade, I only got one B. In 6th and 7th I got straight A's all year. So to come into 8th grade and have a teacher I didn't like at all (at the time) and get a B,  I was pissed.  Second quarter, I didn't really care because what was the point in getting an A now, ya know? 3rd quarter, I was slipping to almost a C, luckily I kept the B. Now, I'm am this damn close to an A. What's different now that I really want the A? To prove to my parents that I can! And I feel like if I get it, it'll be a gateway for me to get my belly button pierced. Tomorrow is our last quiz. aka the last chance I have to get that damn A! So I was "calcutating" my grade today in Mazer's (my math teacher) room. I found out that even if I got 100% on the quiz that I'd still have a B. So I went and told Mr. Mazer that. He told me that if I get a 100% on the quiz tomorrow that he'll give me an A for the quarter. I have this thing where I can never believe in myself and I don't think I'm gonna get the A. It feels like I've worked my ass off just to have it all thrown away. I mean I have my reasons for not believing in myself. (1) I've only gotten one 100% this year. That was on the Cedar Point quiz which I felt was quite easy.  (2) The pressure of knowing that I  have  to get an A will prevent me from doing so. RR! Stress! Well, I really don't have anything to talk about so I'm gonna go read my book which is very addicting...Oh by the way, Laboda is having a huge end of the year party Friday at his house, anyone can come! Don't know the times yet but just keep it in mind! Jules, that means you!
