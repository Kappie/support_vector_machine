I've jumped in to the future of technology...Im even learning html!!! stand back all, i might hurt sumthing ;)  So whats new in the life of my readers??? Not too much to report here, Im definetly getting my belly button peirced this summer, and i hope my tongue...and i wanna get a tattoo too, but im not sure of what yet...but i might get to go to vancouver for 1 day and a bit, for a biology/ capp field trip...we're going to UBC and the museum of anthropolgy!!! but i have to make sure its ok with my mom first...and it only costs like $60, because you hve to pay for your own food.. and you get to go to the mall and shop aswell...and im gonna get money for that too if i can! so i hope i'll get to go, i mean its educational, and funn all at the same time...but i will most likely get to go if i do all my chores and help pack some before i go...  Oh ya im moving into my grandmothers old house, the one they live in at the moment, and the reason is that my house im renting got sold and my granma and uncle and aunt bought a house so they're moving into their new house, into the area my mom like and we are moving out, beside noisy abnoxious children, talk about a good deal??? right, s is ur do winning the million while you get a bullet in the head!!!  I've been feeling a little edgy lately, a little more then usual... I have a few friends that refuse to talk to me, but won't give me an explanation, and then I have the ones who can't mind their own business, who nag and bitch lioke im their god and need mee all the time...  Sometimes i think of taking off, without telling any of my annoying friends where im going...just not be there for them, like their not there for me, because sometimes i need someone to talk to, someone i can confide in, and not have to worry if they think im a mental case or permiently in love ith them.... And thankfully i have a ouple of those or i would most likely go insane!!!  Well I must be going for now, its almost lunch time and i have to urinate, not that lunch has much to do with that sentance but you know what i mean!!!  Talk to ya'll later!!!
