I can honestly say that there are a few of them I'd only do something for because I'm a Christian.  That's sad.  I don't even know some of their names.  First or last.  Someone asked me what were the last names of the families, all I knew was Jackson.  That's it.  Oh well.   I miss my mama.  Even though she called me fat.  Well, she never really said hey you're fat.  But if I gained weight she'd ask if I was pregnant and when I lost it she'd ask if I was anorexic.  Sometimes I wonder what she would have said had I answered yes to either of those questions.  It's funny to think about.  Anyway, despite all that I still miss her.  She'll be here sometime this year.  I hope.  She'd better be here.  Otherwise she's gonna get it.  She's a crazy woman.  She encouraged me to be a stripper.  I was never a stripper, but when I was contemplating it, she said go for it.  Regardless of what anyone says I think that's cool as hell.  Which would you rather hear?  You're nasty. Or... go for it?  I made my own decision ultimately, but it was good to know that she wouldn't have hated me if I made the "wrong" one.  Well, Dead Like Me is getting better and better.  Season two starts the last week of July.  I plan to be there.  Oh yeah.  I do.  Happy day that is supposed to be the 4th of July but is actually the 5th...everyone!!  9 or maybe 8.  Wait a minute...yeah it's 9 more days til tammy's berfday!!!
