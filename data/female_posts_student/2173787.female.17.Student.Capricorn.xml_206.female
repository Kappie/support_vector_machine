I don't know but its getting ridiculous.  What is even sadder is that I've seemed to have disappeared.  Friday night was awesome, but did I post about it? Did I write about my time at UNC? No.  I forget what I do each day, moving forward in a daze, looking to the end, but not knowing what I'm looking forward to.  I'm stuck in this cloud of fog and can't see out.  Instead I see swirls, hints of things that used to be bright and clear and a slight foreshadow of the future. When did my present become a way station to bigger and better things?  When did I begin to accept tomorrow as an appropriate time to do everything?
