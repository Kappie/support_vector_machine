This has got to be the first time ive been sad that its ended but this year just wasnt what vbs has been in the past.......... like the bubble ahh the bubble the most ingenious vbs invention ever i still remember being so fascinated with the bubble. But now things hav e change we are all about keeping up with the pentacostal people as todd says and we cant just do bible skits anymore noooo gotta have goofy characters. but anyway it is kinda fun.........and the kids are adorable we only had five again tonight but it was fun we sang lots of songs and did the hokey pokey and sang where oh where is sweet little so and so a wonderfully time consuming song! The snacks were good tonight though we went and go lots of extras too... oh well. it was sad though we tore down our beautiful room it looks so bear now.........and the crazy frog lady is gonna put all her suffocating frogs back up again...ugh. i did feel bad though because i didnt finish Larry David's shoes because i took a nap and forgot to go and buy more balloons.        Its sad all the mission trip people are leaving on saturday for over a week its going to be very quiet at church except that i wont be there because of band camp and going to homecoming at Hawk Pride! i wish i could go though it would be soooooo much fun! but at least i will still have claire so its all good... i think we might go see the notebook tomorrow night it looks like one of those romantic type movies i duno maybe a chick flick oh well something to laugh about! yay.    But i have figured something out i think the reason we have so many problems today with people saying I love you just anytime they feel like it is its not really our fault its the stupid english languages fault! because we only have one word for love and it has to mean all the different kinds of love! and there is many......so it usually gets you in trouble when you say it cause then people say you dont mean it even if you do just not in a romantic way ya know i mean goodness why couldnt the english have been smart like the greeks and had four words for it! we should just start using them it would make things easier that way you could tell everybody you loved them in just the right ways and nobody would get hurt or offended or put off....
