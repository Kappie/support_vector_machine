I meant to go to bed early, really, but I got distracted by my new poetry blog ( urlLink click here  or I'll bust your balls). I was making the template for it and it took forever and now it's five in the friggin morning and I still haven't gone to bed. Surprisingly enough, I'm still coherrent enough to think in complete sentences and as far as I know I'm spelling everything right haha.    I parallel parked today. It was sooooo much easier than I thought it would be. I only had to do it twice before Coach H let me stop. So now  on Saturday   tomorrow  I do highway driving, and then my test is July 20th (Monday). Yikes. I'm pretty confident about it though because I'm doing a lot better now. So yeah...    Chels found a gecko in the house earlier; it's the first one we've ever had in here. It was only about an inch long and so very cute. We trapped it and took it outside, but not until we named it something (the Japanese word for one, because it was 1:30 in the morning when we found him; I'm too far gone to remember it right now haha). It felt good to release him outside because he probably would've died in the house considering there aren't any bugs for him to eat indoors.    I'm going to bed now. Good night...er, morning...screw it.     RIGHT NOW     mood ::  zzzzzzzzz   listening to/watching :: WinAmp - She Will Be Loved by Maroon 5   eating/drinking ::  nada nada nada   craving ::  sleep, but it's my own fault   talking to ::  nobody, it's 5 fucking am!   thinking about ::  a certain somebody...   wishing ::  that certain somebody would call   wearing ::  PJs   random ::  I have a giant Pirates of the Caribbean poster on my wall.
