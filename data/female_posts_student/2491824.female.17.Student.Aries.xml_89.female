What happened?...  ...I think it's because I stopped doing my homework..  I probably should start doing it again...  We just started doing stuff with imaginary numbers and complex numbers, and it's pretty easy...  I wasn't in class when Mrs. Davis explained it yesterday, and I didn't do the homework for it last night... I picked up on it just from class today when she was going over the homework, so I don't have any worries about it... But, still, I should do it...   G yelled at me today for having so many absences that I can't go to State Competition. ....Jordan was disappointed that I couldn't go because I wouldn't be there to "amuse" him... Cory (one of the chicks that I was going to room with there--along with Claire and Gabi) acted thrilled that I couldn't go... hehe... I'm loved... :) I asked G if I would still be allowed to get out of my classes for the in-school perfomances of  Mockingbird , and he said that he was pretty sure that I could. Yay... I think...   I'm getting so sick of everything...  Blah....  I have to go to  Mockingbird  rehearsal on Thursday to have headshots taken... Joy... :/   Oh, and Friday, the scene that I am directing is being performed... I'm nervous...
