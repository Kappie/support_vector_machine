It's possible that we have found a house to move into and it has a great backyard, so if all goes as we hope it does, then I'd be glad to host it. But if anybody else has a killer pad they're dying to show off, I'd be totally willing to bow out. You know, mostly an excuse to eat too much cheese dip and other goodies from the farmer's market and drink box wine and get to know eachother. I know, I know, you all already know eachother, but *I* don't. And I was kidding about the box wine.
