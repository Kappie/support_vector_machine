A few min. before they did Leslie came up there (Leslie and Liz dont like eachother) So when Liz got there she got all upset and left. I was so pissed! How can you let someone have that much of and advantage over you. She left her best friends. So when I called her there was no getting her back at the pool hall. So me tony and Ryan all had our own fun.      Later that night come to find out Liz is talking shit to me and Ryan telling us we can fuck off! So I told her that I didnt want to be friends with some one who is backstabing. She tried to say she was sorry and whatever but I honestly didnt want to hear it. She pissed me off beyond belief.       Well What is a true friend anyway?!
