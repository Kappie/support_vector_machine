You see, myself i have drank 2 times, and i do plan on doing it again. I dont do it for the popularity reason, but for the reason of feeling good, and being stupid with others. But people who do party everyday, get drunk all the time, do drugs all the time, are simply pathedic. I dont see a point in doing it. Its a waste of time. But it's their time that they are wasting, not ours( we can do that ourselves)They are ruining there lifes (Not ours). But if you just drink once in a while, i dont see the harm in it. And drinking by yourself is no fun. Its funner with other people. And i dont know if i should being saying this, but i do go church, and looking back to it, i have seen god slowly do odd things in my life, and in my family, through rough times. And i guess i am going throught this "stage" were i want to expierence things. But im not going to regret it, because im not going to go overboard. But i will talk about my opinion church and what not some other time.  Hannah  ( I bought the best pins. let me explain. On has George Bush, and it says MORON across it. (Yes i do not like him), then one with elvis and it says DEAD across it, and the other says "CNN telling lies since 1980. wicked? yes i know)
