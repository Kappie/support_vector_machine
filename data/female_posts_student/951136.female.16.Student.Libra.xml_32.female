EVEN THO IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE, b.c. its not like its even an issue anymore...sigh...i'm supposed to be over this. i've supposed to have moved on. like he has. this is crap. b..c its just coming back more lately. i hate it. i walked out of the fiddler on the roof production. and it had  randomly reminded me, and i was thinking about it. why cant it happen. why does everything have to seem so hopless? any one can do anything they want. no one is stoping them. except themselves.   -"If two people truely [like] each other, but just can't get it together; when do you get to that point where enough is enough?" -"Never"  sigh...i wish....
