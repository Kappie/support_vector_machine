Last night I had two types of starfruit fresh from the Amazon rainforest! WOWWWEEE! It was really nice! *the small yellow ones are really strong though!* Mmm... he brought me back some Inca Cola! *which is err yellow... and err smells funny!* Don't worry, I'll drink it anyway! Yeay! Oh and he brought back some mate de coca... hehe... it's legal... really! Which is really nice! *better be organic!* He's now... at his girlfriends house, but hopefully we can have a chat, it sounds like he's had some amazing experiences... share your almighty wisdom! *i need it!*
