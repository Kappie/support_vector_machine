I have to write a paper on a the creation of a pedagogy for Rikers island and send my advisor what I have of my senior thesis so far. Yuck. ick!  It's not that I haven't kept up on what's been going on in Haiti, I have, I'm just kind of in observer mode at the moment. Believe you me there will be more on that later.    Most relevant   Most of my family has moved out of haiti to either florida or canada. All who's left of blood relatives are my aunt and nephews who live in Cafu fuille. We haven't heard from them but wouldn't be surprised if they were fighting with the rebels.   There will be an intense commentary starting early spring.   Film at 11
