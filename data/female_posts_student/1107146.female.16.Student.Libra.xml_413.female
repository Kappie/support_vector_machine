In a few seconds here, I am going to devise the longest sentence ever, one that consists of much nonsense and other such entities of babble, and am going to stretch it out to the longest extent possible, perhaps so long that it may induce a comatose state in its peruser, perhaps an aneurysm or such other maladies, in which case I would feel exceptionally horrible because I was trying to be on top of the literary dung heap, and all it has brought me is death, chaos, and destruction, the three black goats of creation, christened before time and held only by the bonds of reality as we know it, the impermeable realm of what is considered as "true", until such times as they are needed, and if this sentence (which has become the longest sentence on Antiphilanthropy and, in fact, ever) does kill someone, we shall know that their services have been duly rendered on this earth once again, starting here on my humble 'net abode and spreading the whole world over as they have since man first interacted, O brutal agony.  That was the biggest bit of psychobabble I've ever heard, but I WIN! \v/h0 c|@ /\/\@|\|? i c|@ /\/\@|\|!   \/\/00T!  3L337 is ASS-BAD. Hoo-ah!  I just finished another song for the official demo! That makes two out of a necessary "eight", and hopefully a "ten", because I'd rather just hear them all now, instead of playing out in my head like they always do. But the newest one,  Painpainted  sounds rather like it did in my head... Problems , the other, is significantly close. There's lots of screaming in  Painpainted , it's amazing. It reminds me of Linkin Park, and it would make sense that I was listening to them a lot at the time of the authoring of this song. Amazing.  So I figure, since I've been thus turned down in English, that the only way to get out of it will be to not be here at all...that means, I'm going to come home every day and finish at least one song, and hopefully I'll get the tape approved, and hopefully I'll need to go record, and hopefully I'll go touring...in which case...G'BYE BENTW00D!   EEk, perhaps before I was a bit scared to go anywhere, but now I have some incentive (despite it being a bit juvenile), so I figure I'll just act on it and pay with a heroin OD when I'm 30 (I get to die later Abby, YAY!) and such.   But that will require finding someone that'll take us on, us and our "non-descript genre" selves. Some guy who listened to us the other day defined us as being "punk"...that's badass. I dunno what we are. It like...hip-hop, hard rock, punk, metal, etc., probly a thousand things and that's why I can't label me. Cry. But that doesn't really matter because the next album ( Into the Outside , BUY TODAY!) is going to be incredibly heavy and most of the songs are already in the works...more punk-ish. But that, friends, is for another day.  WOW, I'm jacked on caffeine and I just got done recording and sweating all over the place from doing it (drumming with no fans on, no windows open, closed AC vent...for sound quality, as abysmal as it is). YAY! And now I'm going to Nashville, so you troopers have a wonderful day and I'll see ya down on the upside.  Hoo-AH!
