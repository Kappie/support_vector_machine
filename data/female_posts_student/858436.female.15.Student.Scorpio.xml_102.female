They weren't washed, and were in a plastic grocery bag. I was just bringing some vegetables to a lonely old lady who lived in a big house behind ours.   I came to the front porch and rang the doorbell. Her old car was in the driveway but no lights were on, so I figured no one was home. It was very hot outside and it was around dinnertime, so I figured that if she was there, she would most likely be having dinner, or in bed already. The door opened. "Oh, hi, Ms. Toy! I just brought some squash and cucumbers and.." Her face lit up with a joy I cannot explain. "Oh, come on in, honey!" She said.   I walked into a pristine living room with pretty things that were very breakable. She picked up a cordless phone sitting on the chair next to the door. "Oh, Elizabeth honey, I've got company here with all sorts of great vegetables who has come to see me! I'll talk to later." She told me that she had just been "gabbing with one of her girlfriends" and that she'd love for me to come sit down.  We went into the impeccable kitchen and sat down. No lights were turned on in the entire house. It was around 7:00, but the early evening July sun was still streaming in through the kitchen windows. "Now, you're the oldest? Madeline?" she asked. "My, you are just so pretty! I mean, you just have the prettiest face. You certainly have grown into a lovely young lady." I could tell that my visit was really meaning something to her. She immediately began chatting about her latest health ailments and her daughter who lived down the street and all her different medications. After a lowdown on everyone above age 75 in Sikeston's health, she asked me how my family was doing. "Oh, pretty well.. Virginia and Charles are getting ready for Camp and we've just been so busy this summer," I said. "Well that's what you should be: busy," she replied with a smile. "I remember once, maybe three or four years ago, your little brother and his friend were playing in my pebble pile I keep over there by the carport. I keep that pebble pile for my flowers," she said. "And I looked out the window and they were scattering my pebbles. So I went outside and kindly asked them to not play in my pebble pile, and before I had even opened my mouth, that little boy shot off through the gate and into your yard! Oh, it was so funny! I've told so many people that story and I get such a kick out of it every time!" I easily imagined my mischevious little brother shooting through the fence. "Your family is young and y'all should be having all sorts of fun. I remember when my husband was alive, we just loved sitting out on the porch and hearing you kids play in the yard and jump out there on that trampoline. And we loved hearing the Sansagraws across the street in their pool. Reminded us of when our kids were young and we used to go on road trips all over the place." Her eyes were lit with nostalgia.   She told me stories of her husband with heartfelt detail. "Yes, those last thirty-seven days seemed like years," she said while straightening a placemat on the table. "You never know what life is going to throw at you. I guess you can understand that with your grandfather." "So how is your boyfriend doing?" I asked. "Oh, not well at all," she said looking down. "Terminal cancer." My heart broke into a million pieces. Her husband died six years ago from cancer, and now her boyfriend of one year was being stolen away by it as well. "Well, maybe he'll get better," I thought to myself. "We just love each other's company," she said smiling. "Just going to church and eating at each other's houses. And oh we laugh together so much! Last night we were talking on the phone and he was hallucinating from all the morphine he's been getting.." The pieces of my heart broke even more. "And he was saying alll these crazy thing! Oh but they were so funny so I just played along with it. And this morning when he had come to his senses we just laughed and laughed!" "Well that's good, that you are both having fun, especially now," I said. "Oh it sure is. Just enjoy life while you can, darlin'."  She was in the middle of another story when the doorbell rang. "Please let it not be my sister," I prayed in my mind. "Oh look, it's your sister!" she said answering the door. I was sad to leave. I was enjoying listening to her stories and sitting in her pretty home with her new carpet she told me about, and the curtains she sewed herself last winter. But more than anything, I was sad to leave her in that house all by herself. "You girls come visit me anytime!" she said with a cheerful smile. "We certainly will," I replied.   "Were you guys talking the entire time?" my sister asked as we went down the walkway. "Yep, how long was I there?" I asked. "Maybe an hour or so," she replied. "Well, I really enjoyed being with her," I said, blinking into the sun.  And as I cut through the yard to my house, my eyes were filled with tears.
