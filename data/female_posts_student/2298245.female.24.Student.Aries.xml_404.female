But some things everyone should be able to agree upon:  1.  For better or worse, Ronald Reagan was one of the most important and influential men to hold the office of President in the 20th Century.  I happen to think it was for the better.  Many disagree, and I suppose I could understand that.  But he served this country during some of the most important moments in history, and he is largely responsible for the state of the government today, though his rolling back of the sheer size of government has been curtailed slightly under Clinton and the current President Bush.    2.  Because of this, the occasion of his death means something.  It is the end of something, of someone who meant something very big to the country.  It is a moment to stop and reflect and to mourn, if so inclined.  He filled a space in this world with his giant presence, and his absence, though not sudden or even new, leaves a great void that must be acknowledged.    My personal thoughts are that this is a sad and momentous occasion.  I don't think there's anything in politics like him any more, or ever will be again, and I think we are the worse for it.
