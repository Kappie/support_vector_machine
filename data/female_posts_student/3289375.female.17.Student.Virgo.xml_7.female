Nah to be honest with you i just regret letting go so many things i had in my hand for example i wouldnt call it letting go because that person is still there for me and were still together but things arent just the same. I would do dumb things like write letters to my guy friends, walk with other GUY friends just to make him jealous and just because of that it leaded to a point where he doesnt trust me any more and i dont like that feeling because i wonder if sometimes he has doubts about me.   I dont like him thinkin that i talk to someone else or that i like his friend just because of those sill things because that makes me feel so bad and i dont like feeling like that and it was all because i dont know just for the he!! of it.I regret tryin to see his actions just by tryin to make him jealous because it leaded to where he doesnt trust me or not even my feelings anymore and if i could i would go back and not do those things that i did and change what i did just to make him realize how much i do care for him but its just one of those that u have live up to because its in the past and u cant change the past, the only left to do is by not doing the same things in the future.   Try to make things better and make them change because things change but in this case they have changed for the bad because we have lost alot of communication and alot of trust which are one of the most important things in a relationship and wish so bad i can get them back but i am working on it, working on showing him that i made a mistake and i learned for the good and that i really do care for him and do want to make things work out!!!
