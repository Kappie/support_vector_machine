Besides, the road there is very easy to drive and it's only an hour long (not even worse then goign to Santa Cruz through Highway 9) ANyways, if anyone is up to it contact me, i think Salcido and Paul might already go but then again it's no guarantee. If of course that is alright Avery groupies. Sicne i've gone to sonic with paul and laurabefore (on top of it) it will be pretty awesome. (Mandy too!!! that was freaking cool!!!) SHe knows SHE REMMEBERS!
