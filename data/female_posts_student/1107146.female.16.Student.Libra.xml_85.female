My dad woke me up and sat there talking to me for about half an hour, trying to get me to focus. It worked, but my head still feels like it weight a thousand pounds.  I have a DI meeting today.  And after that I'm coming home, I'm going to do whatever the HELL I feel like doing.  Whee.  Catching up on sleep, probably.  Shit.
