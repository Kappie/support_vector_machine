It's a bit impractical in that it takes words from what you type in and sets them to interpreting your dream, i.e.: raven, crow: preoccupation with death, a sense of haunting, or something like that. But it  can  make some sense if you let it.  You're right, yesterday wasn't a good day, and somehow today isn't looking so good either.
