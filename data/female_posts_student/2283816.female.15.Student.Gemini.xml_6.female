I am bursting with excitement - and the temptation to put off geometric means just a bit longer. I have better things to do, thank you.    ANYWAY. I was listening to this FAB FAB song I've been literally in love with since I was six. It's called "Shut Up and Kiss Me" by the wonderful Mary Chapin Carpenter. Take a read, find the song, and show it to your guy. :-)  _______________________________________________________ Don't mean to get a little forward with you, don't mean to get ahead of where we are Don't mean to act a little nervous around you, I'm just a little nervous about my heart 'cause It's been awhile since I felt this feeling that everything that you do gives me It's been so long since somebody whispered Shut up and kiss me Didn't expect to be in this position, didn't expect to have to rise above My reputation for cynicism, I've been a jaded lady when it comes to love but Oh baby just to feel this feeling that everything that you do gives me It's been too long since somebody whispered Shut up and kiss me  There's something about the silent type attracting me to you All business baby none of the hype That no talker can live up to  Come closer baby I can't hear you, just another whisper if you please Don't worry 'bout the details darlin', you've got the kind of mind I love to read Talk is cheap and baby time's expensive, so why waste another minute more Life's too short to be so apprehensive, love's as much the symptom darlin' as the cure Oh baby when I feel this feeling, it's like genuine voodoo hits me It's been too long since somebody whispered... Oh baby I can feel this feeling that everything that you do gives me It's been too long since somebody whispered Shut up and kiss me Shut up and kiss me     I love it, I tell ya. I had good taste at the tender age of six. Mom is making pizza. Whee. Bye, y'all.
