We go to classes in the morning then there are a bunch of activities like three-legged races and egg tosses and stuff like that outdoors for the rest of the day. You know, just like a fun day where everyone can hang out. These type of days are not for me.  The only event I thought might be worth watching was the pie-eating contest. Haha. That's so great. Well, anyway, I actually got out of going and my whole family thinks I'm crazy. Really, crazy wasn't the word anybody used, but " weird " and " mental " were. I italicized them because they were emphasized when in use. "You are so  MENTAL !" and so forth and so on.  Well anyway, my dad's a teacher and he was there and I asked him about the pie-eating contest and he said (the elipse thing(...) denotes I don't remember what he said exactly.),  "...kids throwing up everywhere."  Hahahaha. That actually might have been worth a miserable afternoon. I would have stayed to see that.  But they already think I'm crazy, and I can see why. But anway, Thursday I was not going to go, but I could tell my dad was all dissappointed because I'm not a social butterfly or pretty or athletic or popular. You know, parents like that. But no, I'm a huge loser and let down for my dad and he knows I'm all introverted and shy like I am and everything and I could tell he was just thinking, "I should have known she would skip out on S. Day." Or something to that effect.  So I was like, "I'm GOING." Because you know...it's not that fun being a dissapointment." And so my dad was like, "What??" And it's hard to explain, but I guess he knew I didn't want to go and didn't know why I was saying I was going to go.  And so my parents were watching TV in the TV room (whaddya know) and were like, "You don't have to go!" I was like, " I'm going! " And went up the stairs and they laughed. Both of them. I don't know why.  So I said, "IT'S NOT FUNNY! I DON'T WANT TO GO!" Not all that loud or anything, I shouldn't have used all-caps. But anyway, eventually I could tell my dad thought I was in complete sufferage and mental-anguish or something over going so I eventually agreed to go. He thinks I didn't want to go because I didn't want to miss school.   But then later, when I was in the kitchen with my folks, and I was asking my dad about S. Day and the pie eating contest and all that jazz, I said I was just going to go because of him.  This leads to stupid stuff from my mom about me always doing stuff I don't want to do for my dad and I won't do a single thing for her. Blah blah. That's another story.
