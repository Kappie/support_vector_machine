I got to sit in an F-4 cockpit. (its a fighter jet... its gennerally called a Phantom or Phantom II)..the feeling of sitting in that cockpit just blew me away to say the least. It was like, i sat down in that thing and it was sort of a "oh my god" moment. i wish it actually flew :p wouldnt mind going on a joy ride at a few hundred MPH.  I didnt get to bed untill the wee hours of the morning last night because i was talking to someone on IM for a long time, and when im talking on IM, time seems to dissapear. I was almost sure i was going to have a dream about planes in one way or another..but alas when i woke up, if i had any, i didnt remember them. Today however has been just plain BORING....i went to band practice for 2 hours this morning which was just as exciting as buzzing your lips off and blowing through a trumpet for 2 hours..wait..thats exactally what i did!..and then when i got home there was about a hour skip and then it was off to the dentist....and then back here. for some reason, everyones all tired today. even those of us who didnt go to the museum yesterday..as soon as my mom and I got home, it think my mom crashed out on the couch or something. she was tired as ever. I myself had quite alot of energy this morning and now i feel like colapsing. must be the weather or something...alwell.   thats all for now...  -'Phoenix'
