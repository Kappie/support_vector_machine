He was standing, and he was in full wrestling gear, but he had this jogging pants and shirt on. I don't think he had on his headgear on. But I walked over to him, and in the dream, I was still the wrestling manager, but for some reason, I couldn't go to the meet that night. So I was talking to Shawn, and he just kept saying that he was soo scared, and that he didn't know if he wanted to go to the meet that night. And he kept hugging me. So that's when I woke up, but I went back asleep, and it was like if you got up from watching TV to get something to eat, and you miss something on the TV show,cause next thing I know, we're making out! Sooooo weird!!            Yeah, well, mom got me a new computer desk... Very nice! lol. And probably this week, I'll be moved into my new room!! :) I can't wait!! lol. I guess that's all for now!            ~~Breena
