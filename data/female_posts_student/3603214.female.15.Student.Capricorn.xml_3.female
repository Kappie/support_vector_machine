Being annoying as they are, the rents wouldn't let me hitch a ride w/ him since he's only had his license for exactly a month. And I had to argue that it wasn't a date and that if it was somebody else, I would have been able to hitch a ride and go in peace. But I was desperate to get out of the house and I wanted to see Dodgeball and Brad can be a nice kid so I agreed that my mom would take me. It was a lot of fun. I thought it would b weird, but we just hung out. I didn't even hafta pay for my ticket lol. I'm $6 richer than I thought I would b at the end of today. So yea, for now, Brad is like a savior in a way. I haven't laughed that hard or that much in a long time. I know that I mentioned this, but hey, it's the truth. For almost 2 hours I was back in a place that I had missed so much. I was happy. For 2 hours I didn't have to worry about anything. It was nice. In other words, see that damn movie! It's so dumb in parts, it's great. I have to disagree w/ Brad and say that Spaceballs IS the better movie and is not equally funny. But we all know that Holy Grail is the god of all funny movies. I should see funny movies more often which reminds me...I need to call a friend. So yea...I'm never gonna go to sleep so I'm gonna try to convince my mama that I'm sick and I shouldn't have to go to the carwash for choir. I don't like morning shifts...that's all...
