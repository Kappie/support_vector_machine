Ben called me though and invited me, that made me happy because it means that other people do know that I'm alive LOL. It was fun cause we stole a bunch of 'Got Milk?' pencils, and I drank some milk too, only $.50. It was great because I was thirsty and poor. My webcam is a piece, it is broken or something. I found the receipt though, I'm either going to exchange it or return it. It depends on my monetary situation. I definitely need to put the $33 back in the bank that I took out yesterday for literary purposes.It was worth it though. I wouldn't have traded yesterday for a delicious bass, that's FO SHO! Yumm, my mouth just waters when I think about that frappacino I bought twice. Tomorrow I have to awake at probably 6am to leave here at 6:45 to babysit, it sucks yes, but need the money. Then it's to work at 4 to endure 6 hours of Andrew and his rather large head. Until next time...
