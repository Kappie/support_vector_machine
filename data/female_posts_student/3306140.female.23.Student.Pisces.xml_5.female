He has this butter looking skin, soft hair, and beautiful eyes. But enough about his looks, I was going to have him for myself.  Only one problem he is eighteen years old. My heart sank, a eighteen year old boy. What am I going to do with him, play with him. This has got to be the most confusing thing right, but no it gets worst. I have another guy that is nice and caring but i never see him he lives in orlando. I really care for him and I want him to be my man but he lives so far away. I could go on about it but that is not all. There is another guy, he is great and loves me but he is in the military. I don't think I can take him dying on me, so I let he leave me without tell him I love you.  See i told you my life is full of drama.
