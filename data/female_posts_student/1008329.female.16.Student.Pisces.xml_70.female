My mom also has an obsession with wardrobes and that show isn't helping. All Mr. Villa is doing is talking to a clerk about the wardrobe. They call that "entertainment".  I went to Ana Nuevo yesterday with mi familia. We watched elephant seals..Oh JoY. :-P As we were driving there I thought I was going to die b/c I had the hugest headache and felt like I was going to barf.   Certain people keep mentioning to me that VDay is coming up. They like me but are trying to be secretive. I don't like anyone.  That's all for now..
