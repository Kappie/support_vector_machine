I spent the night with her last night becaus we both had to get up and go to work at 8:30 this morning!... yesterday when we got off work, we went to Ridgeland to David's house.. then his friend Tye came over and we all went to Wendy's cause Tye was hungry... then we left there and went to some huge party in Madison! it was crazy!.. there were more people at that one party then in the whole city of clinton!.. it was funn though!.. but guess who I bumped into there... Justin Allard... yea, he is sooo fat these days... well not like obese or anything but he is wider now than when we dated!... it was soo weird seein him though!... he like kept walkin by and finally I just busted out with hey justin!, and he was on the phone and he was like 'dude' i'll call you back' and he got off the phone and hugged me!, it was really weird, then we walked over to where Dana, Tye, and David were standing and i was like who are you here with and he names some people and then he asked me and i was like well ME  DAVID and Dana  Tye... and he was like oohhh.... and then I was like well I have to pee reallyyy bad! and I was talkin to David and justin butts in with come with me, i'll take you!... its up stairs, and I was like ummm.... ohh, ok... and so he like walked me upstairs, but thank God Dana and David came with me!... but anyways... enough about him... it was just shockin to see him, caseu he is like the last person I would have expected to see there!... but anyways... well everything was good... until someone runs up yellin 'Cops' and so everyone like started freakin out!... The Cops gave us five minutes for everyone with a car to get out, and if not then we were all gettin tickets! and that wouldn't hav ebeen a problem if it didn't take us five  minutes to walk to our car! we had to park like 1/2 a mile down the road because there were so many people there!... but it was funn!... after the party got busted we left and went to David's house and chilled there a while! and then left and came back to Clinton! We were supposed to meet up with Jason and Bryan... cause uh.. Bryan is uh.. very interested in Dana if ya know what I mean! haha!.. he is so hott! so this could definately work, haha right Dana!~... but anyways.. we are about to roll out so I'll blog about tonight tomorrow! bye bye!!*
