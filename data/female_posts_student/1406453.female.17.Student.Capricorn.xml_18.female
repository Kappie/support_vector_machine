The leather interior on the Acura is a godsend. Went to services, had the 5th Aliyah (friend had the 7th).  It was wonderful to see him again; I really miss being around him during the summer. Jillian picked me up in Newhall in the afternoon.  We went to Macaroni Grill (yummy) and shopping @ the Northridge mall where I bought a nice gray and purple striped knit tee.  So nice, out of character, but nice. Sunday was the AU meet-and-greet.  I was the only student there (others already there) but lots of cool alumni.  In fact, the guy who founded AU's Hillel was there.  He had amazing stories about formal dinners with Dr. Anderson, the namesake of my residence hall. Today I did things I was supposed to do (I slept for 12 hours, for goodness sake) and then finally made it over to my aunt's house (house-sitting for 4 days).  Going to Manchurian with Brad tonight @ the free theater- fun fun.  Back to a quiet house for the night... not bad.
