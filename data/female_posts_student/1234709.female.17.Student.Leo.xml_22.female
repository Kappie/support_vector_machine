I don't know if it's the beginning of summer, or just the fact that I can't stop reminiscing. Maybe I'll do a list of my favorite songs from my grade 11 year. Hm yes, here goes:  1.  Everything but The Girl - Downhill Racer  2. The Doors - Break on Through 3. Pink Floyd - Brain Damage 4. Tool - Aneima 5.  Strokes - Someday  6. Moneen - Start Angry 7.
