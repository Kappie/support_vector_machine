Working -- at the Center for the Study of the American South and studying for exams.   Elizabeth's Birthday -- My wife just turned log(base 2)67,108,864.  So I had to run around getting presents, cards, and taking her to dinner and ice cream.  She's worth every second.   I'm still busy.  But in the meanwhile, check out the new pictures on the  urlLink Nieces  page.  And expect a post from me soon on Christians and the urban environment.  I'd like to start a book group (long distance) with some of you on Environmentalism and the Christian Faith.  Until then  -
