Because the bible says "Anger resides in the lap of fools" Which can mean only fools hold a grudge and cover their lives with anger. Not only does anger harm you but it is one of satan's ways of turning you from the ways of God.   To handle your anger try to...     1) Take a walk  Exercise burns of excess adrenalin and helps you to calm down and think things over more clearly, so if you happen to be in a place where there is alot of anger just simply walk away instead of getting involved.   2) Accept your limits  Be sure to recognize things you can't control like others attitudes , traffic, cancelled appointments or flights and count your blessings like health, the fact that you've got god, your family, your job and maybe the car that might get you to where you want to go like church.   3) Be careful where you release your anger  It's one thing to be angry but where you release your anger is another be sure when you are angry not to blow your lid around friends or family. But share calmly your feelings with those you trust and know will understand.   4) Don't hang out with angry people  like happiness and graditude angriness is contagious. So whenever God says dont hang out with angry people, It's good adivce, take it!
