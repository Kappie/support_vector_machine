I thought MoMo made it up. Ahahahaha. It's so...not cute. I'm taking a pic of it, anyway. I should bring my camera everywhere. !!!! When I was walking home with Shanelle yesterday, we saw some old Asian lady with a cigarette in her mouth and all this smoke was gushing out...like she didn't know how to smoke the damn thing. I burst out laughing. That's so mean...I think she was too into what she was doing (or not doing) to notice that we were laughing at her ass. FUNNY SHIT, though. It would have been the coolest picture. Dammit!!! Oh, and this other time at Walgreens, this guy had his butt crack showing. Okay...understatment. His whole cheeks were hanging out. Nasty. Then, he smiled. I think he felt a little breeze or somethin'.    mmmmkay...class time....   ----------  Theo (9:41:58 PM): Put in my app for the barista job!! lady MADonna 206 (9:42:06 PM): GOOD LUCK!
