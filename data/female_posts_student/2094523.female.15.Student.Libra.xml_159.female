Makes me almost want to hate you..tho i know it wudn't be reasonable... because you havent done anything to me right? cept say those words.. that mean so much it makes me want to cry and makes me want to cry harder if i shall ever find those words to fail me.. to have truly finally realize that the little blackness of doubts inside me was true all along.. words are nothing but lies.
