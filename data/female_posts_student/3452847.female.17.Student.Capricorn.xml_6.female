And i can't be arsed to go back and re-read these again to take out spelling mistakes, bit of a perfectionist... So bored this is like my third post today, no one online as i'm on inset day, and so i'm bored... Emailed Dave, might talk to him later, once i've been paid i'll be so much more happy, this month has really taught me to save my money and not go blowing it on nice mobiles...   ~Lisa~
