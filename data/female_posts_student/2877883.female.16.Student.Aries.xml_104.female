So, here comes a list.  The things I've done so far this weekend at the Cape house: -painted my toenails -worn my new Gap flipflop -gone for long and short bikerides -not seen Ashley (thank god) -watched Ferris Bueller on I Love 86 -driven for the first time in 2 months,I still haven't actually made it to the road -at this rate I will get my license when I am 247834 years old -eaten 2 too many s'mores -taken an annual trip to the Christmas tree shop -recharged  my iPod twice -taken 2 naps -watched  funny dancing roller blade aerobics man -saw some really really large breasted woman with a really really unsupportive tanktop type bra on who was walking really really fast: get the picture? -and, most importantly, I've become best friends with my iPod because I have been quite BORED.  Save me.  Please.  This is not a cry of distress.  When my cool cousin arrives tomorrow it will ALL change.  Believe me.   Ta ta  Goodnight.  My iPod would like to chat now.  Sleepover!
