The national newspapers have proclaimed that we will definitely be under a minority rule after today's election, but they can't predict whose rule since it is much too close to call.  I have my money on the Liberals, but who knows.  Don't forget to vote.  This is perhaps the most exciting election in our lifetimes.  On a more personal note, today is my midterm in Psychology.  I think I have prepared as well as I possibly can, and I know it's too late to acquire any more new knowledge at this juncture.  I did my final practice test (second-time through) this morning and scored 96% on it (woo-hoo!).  If only the actual test were that straightforward!  I have time for one more review of my notes, a little bite to eat and then I must depart for testing.  Wish me luck ...  More to come...
