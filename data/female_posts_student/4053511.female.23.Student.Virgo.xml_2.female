I think I have adult ADD or something because I get bored with one book, either the plot line is moving too slow to retain my attention or I wanted to start something else. This is all pleasure reading of course, because when it comes to reading for classes, well that's like trying to stick jello to the wall somedays. But for those who are curious, I'm currently reading the CrimethInc. book  Days of Love, Nights of War , Samantha Powers' book  A Problem from Hell: American in the Age of Genocide  (which actually was a textbook for my International Ethics course last semester), Alexandre Dumas'  The Count of Monte Cristo  (moving way too slow right now because I'm not to the revenge parts yet.), and finally  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  I've read this already but I wanted to reread it the other day, so I grabbed it off of my bookshelf and brought it to work. Now that I'm not supposed to be reading for class the Powers book is really good. I'm sure it was good when I was supposed to read it for class but again, it was the jello on the wall situation.  Actually, up until recently, I avoided anything Harry Potter and now I can't get enough HP. I'm a big dork, I know. The first step to improvement is acceptance. :)
