All of a sudden we start thinking on our own and realize that no, actually, our parents  aren't  perfect, not at all. I mean, mum is fantabulous. She does basically all the hard housework, most of the cooking, most of the cleaning... there is very little that she  doesn't  do, in fact. But jeepers creepers!! She's angry and annoyed with this 11-year-old who came to dinner last night, because he wanted to be with his mother rather than us kids. This, apparently, really pissed mum off. I'm not quite sure why. She seems to be getting indignant on our behalf - he ends up getting treated like an 'adult', while us (older) (more mature) (more NORMAL) kids are ignored. I don't really care. Neither does N. Neither does S. Neither does L. But for some reason mum is all up in arms about it.   Of course, there is entirely the possibility of me being close-minded and not being able to get in her head, and that a few hours later from now I'll be smacking myself for being dumb. I'll probably go into that later *g* But anyways, I just can't understand how she can be so malicious towards a kid that young. Is it really his fault if he just doesn't like us? I'm sure if I was his age I'd do the exact same thing. In fact, I'm positive I'd do the exact same thing. Mum just doesn't seem to notice that. But dazok.   On a happier note, I talked to Frodo for pretty much the entire last half of English... woo! Love that kid. If I was brave I'd go talk to him when he's off by himself. I think that's when I like him most ^^; People who like being alone and aren't afraid of loneliness inspire me ~v~ Oh! And did anyone else in my eng. class notice that  he did not talk to MO  once  ?? *cheers*   Yes... and about that smacking myself upside the head. I don't know about you guys, but I constantly say things that I end up regretting later. And I'm just like -- if only I had frikkin  thought  more before I said that!! And it superbly annoys me, mostly because I know I could have responded better had I just been thinking differently, more openly... if there is one thing about me that I hate, it's that I get so focused on one thing that I just stop thinking. Like blinkers on a race horse. Can't see the rest of the world, so I end up doing something stupid. And most of the time, I'm pretty open -- but just, sometimes, those blinkers pop up, and I'm entirely screwed.   Regrets suck, but I still think the world needs more of them.
