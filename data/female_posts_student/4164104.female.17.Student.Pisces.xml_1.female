I love my TEAM. i LOVE my team.   and i handled it okay when talkin to big b, but then had a harder time telling rach and bean.  kind of the fact that my team will go through this year without me, just doesn't feel right.  homecoming, and all the crazy outfits we wear, and all the work that pays off later on, that feeling you get of pure exhaustion when you know you played your hardest and nothing else matters.  and my coach said, if we havent gotten anything else from him in these two years, he hopes we have a love for the game.  and i do.   so this means a lot of changing the way i see this year.  a lot more time for college essays and music and any friends that aren't too busy with sports (let me know if you're one of them!).  and yeah, keeping the job at pepperjacks.  it will all work out, i know this, but its hard to face.  and its hard to TELL people, cause i feel like i've failed. which i dont do often.   so you can just act like you know it if you've read this or heard, and i wont be offended, talk to me if you want.. i dunno its all a mess, but will get better.    see ya
