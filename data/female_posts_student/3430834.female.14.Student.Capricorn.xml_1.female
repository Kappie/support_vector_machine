At least ill have dance class later!! we can dance like sluts in our gross costumes (white, red, and black...the pants are see through basically and the shirt shows my whole stomach).  My teacher also either left suddenly or got fired according to our new teacher, which is a good thing bc she cant teach for her life.  So today we're supposed to be redoing our dance to something less "nasty and inappropriate".  I'm gonna go do my hw like a good girl...kisses
