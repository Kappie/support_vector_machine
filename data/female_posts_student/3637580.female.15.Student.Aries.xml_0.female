It was in Illinois, BUUUTT if anyones was as smart as me they would know that the AFTER shock/tremor thing can effect the surrounding states. I mean it is called an EARTHquake effecting the EARTH, more than just the spot it happened at. So yes at 1 sumthing in the morning my freaking couch shook and it scared the shit out of me. And then today I turned on the news and bam I'm not fucking crazy there wwwaaasss an earthquake (not that I had thought of that at the time but anyway..) and Lindsey felt it to so I KNOW I'm not crazy haha. I just had to write this for all those who felt the need to make me feel stupid. CAUSE if you watched the news then you'd now what REALLY happened!!!
