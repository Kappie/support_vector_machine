Maybe I have hurt him too much. I asked him if everything would be the same again and he said yes. Am I heading for self destruction?  He told me while on that night we quarrelled, his ex called him. Shes in need of money fast... She got cheated of 10k by his boyfriend.. Don't ask me how...  Don say he's gonna lend her some money.. Since when he's schooling she helped him in his finances too...  I'm confused. What right do I have now to say anything? He assured me he just wan to repay her n nothing more. I guess I just have to trust him.  I'm taking this chance.  Isn't it ironic?  I think its karma. Never take someone for granted.  D my ex called me yesterday too... Said he broke up with his gf. That she treats him real bad. And he says its retribution. Is he refering about me? I have no idea. ANd I don't even care.  So Don did help me get over him. He did so much for me. I knew from yesterday that I didn't care 2 hoots about my ex anymore. No matter how charming or glib tongue he is. I just didn't care about him anymore. I feel resentment towards him. The nerve he has to call me n talk about his ex. I felt that I'm just wasting my time talking to him on the phone. Why the hell did he call? I couldn't even last 1/2 an hour talking to him. I told him I needed to sleep and hung up on him. At the end of the conversation, I was just looking forward to hang up. He's no longer interesting to me anymore. Why did I take so long to get over this jerk? Why didn't I treasure what I had?  I have no idea if it would be too late now. To treasure this relationship. But I'm taking this chance
