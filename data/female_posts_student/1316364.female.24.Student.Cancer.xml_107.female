I have learned that sometimes as time goes on, some things get progressively worse, feelings towards some people or certain events may feel like they have been left there solely to eat away at your being. Sometime unintentional actions cause things to worsen too and then you are left with more of a mess then were there before. Sometimes you just want to close your eye and make it all go away but you can only sleep for so long before waking up to the reality of the world and therefore you are forced to take these feelings and confront them head on.                These last few weeks I have been forced to confront some feeling I have been avoiding. I learned of some accusations from a family member of a friend of mine possibly stealing a large amount of money from them. It was very easy for me to believe these accusations were true do to the events that lead up to this event and here I was sitting at a table in my head and being forced to choose between my own flesh and blood and the word of two friends.                You see the Ironic part of this whole thing is that it too, like this entry, started with the words/ideas of “Some People Say” and I have decided from this point on that is also how problems develop, by these three words. Now I am not the leading authority on life and I pity anyone who thinks of me that way, after all how much can one 24 year-old be expected to know, especially when the person who supposedly based their life’s decisions on what was said, is over 10 years her senior. It is sort of sad when you think about it.               I live my life knowing that what is told to me by someone else is generally an opinion and there for your be taken lightly on all accounts, because after all its just an opinion. I would never expect anyone to base there thoughts and decisions on anything I may have said and then blame it on me when it backfires. After all it is just an opinion.                If I lived my life going by whatever anyone told me I would not be living my own life right now. I probably wouldn’t be married and I know I wouldn’t have a blog where I post my thoughts because I would have never gone online.               I don’t care who you are or how long I have know you for, the fact of the matter is if you can’t think for yourself and follow your heart and trust in yourself to make the right choices then you shouldn’t be in a situation where that should be an issue.        ve been forced to confront some feeling I have been avoiding.

So back to this table in my head, I have to choose between two friends and my own flesh and blood. The blood relation is more than one person; it is my Mother, my Big sister, my brother, my two Nephews and Niece. So given that, who would you choose?               I love my friends and hearing these accusations have lest my stomach in a twist and my heart torn, but no matter what my family will always come first and true friends would understand that.
