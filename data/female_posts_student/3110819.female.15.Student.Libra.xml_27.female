I was nervous about not knowing anybody, but it was all good, everyone was really nice. we did a lot of work, but it was fun. although I amsooo sick of weeding though. I did that a lot.monday night we went to a park/pool fordinner. we had a waterfight (partially my fault). good times.  the dress fittings were crazy. mine fit, although it was too long. (not surprising). melissa's didn't fit at all, but that's prolly cause her measurements were wrong. isabelle and rayanne's dresses were sizefours since they couldn't get threes, so there's needed a lot of work. anyway, they had toorder a bunch of extramaterial to fix her dress because they didn't before. crazy.   I guess not a whole lot else. just crazy busy getting ready for the wedding. i still have to mow, clean, iron, and write a toast. aaaagggghhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
