It is said that people who start studying while they are high get the pattern of that imprinted on their brain, and then they need to be high to study.  Possibly I am attempting to decenter myself, undermine my own stability with lack of sleep in order to be in a place that is more familiar with writing.  Its just meant too many ciggs, not enough food, and not enough sleep.  I have to keep moving though, and my dreams have gotten more lively.  I dreampt about a dog god the night before last, and the scroll that showed the way he had to die over and over, and it all took place under the ocean.  Last night I dreampt that I was breaking CD's left and right, that there was a party where I went under the surface and swam low to the ground (I tend to swim in the air as opposed to fly in dreams), and then also that I was in this house with another woman, and this man.  I was fairly young, and somehow he had control over us both.  He was abusive, and in the dream me and the woman together were playing hide and go seek with him, and there was fear in my chest, and I was holding her hand, and I said, "we can just leave now, and he will search, and we can go to the shelter..." and she said alright, and we started to leave but then she stopped and said I should go alone.  She said she would catch up, but I knew that she was just stuck here, and I was somehow jealous in the dream, like she was going to get all of his attention- good or bad, and so I stayed, and we tried to hide, and ended up hiding in a box of old toys, and he sat down on top.    I'm trying to wake up a little bit before I attack my paper.  Attack, go to war, destroy and such.  I just need to breath and work with it, flow, be gentle.  I know that all this will work out, and I am not as panicked as my knotted and painful coffee and smoke stomach would imply.  Just sleepy.  Just ready to lay down and call it good.  But I'm awake, and ready to go, yes?  We'll make it through the next five days with flying colors.  Make the grade.  Be a champion.  Deep breath, go stretch, go and take some vitamins (which is bound to help somehow) and keep moving- above all else, keep moving.
