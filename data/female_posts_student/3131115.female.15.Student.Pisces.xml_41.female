Although, sometimes..I just want to come here and vent, because it's not the same anywhere else. No matter what happens, I always find my way back to this blog...which is going to carry on into my next topic.  No matter what happens..I always stay with Bill. I want to, dont get me wrong..neither of these are bad things, just..things that I question to myself a lot. There is so much to explain..I dont know where to start. Marrah told me that she was with Justin, and it made me upset..I dont exactly know why. I told Bill...we had our..*time*. Anyway, so we were great and now Im just being a complete bitch. William thinks that I'm hiding shit from him, but..Im not. I dont know what to do. I would just NOT be bitchy..but there's only one problem with that. I dont realize that I'm doing it. I love him so much, he's my life..my everything. Although, the two of us are having our doubts. I mean, I'm always fucking up..I always say that I'll stop doing shit, but I always do it again. I dont trust myself, I dont know what the hell I want. William does, which is the bad thing, but then again..its an extremely good thing. I never thought that I'd fall in love so early..and I am so very very thankful for it, but sometimes its just not fair.   He's on...I'll write later...
