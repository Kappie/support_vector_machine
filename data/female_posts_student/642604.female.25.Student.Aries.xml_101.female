I am a genius!  As I am walking down I run into a police barricade with three or four policemen up on horseback and one standing between and on the outer sides of each of them.  I try to pass through but they are rounding up hoodlums and despite the fact that I am the most preppy looking person on the street I guess they think I look like the hoodlums because they tell me I can’t pass.  I guess a club had let out cause they were telling everyone to move away from the club and go home.  I asked if I could pass on the other side of the street since there wasn’t any police activity over there and one of the cops told me he didn’t care since they weren’t on the other side of the street.  Great police work!  So I cross the street and head down to my destination.  Once I get to the Javits center everyone is already awake and moving around.  Apparently it had started to rain around 3 AM which had acted like a wake up call.  Everyone was sleepy and tired but the singing had already started.  People were warming up left and right and driving me nuts already.  Caitlin had changed and packed up her stuff already.  So I sat down on the eggshell foam thing we were going to throw away and just waited.  Not long after I showed up Erica and her dad showed up and Erica just fell asleep on the eggshells again.  The rest of us tried to cope with the fact that we were up at 4 AM.  Caitlin, being the good sister that she is, walked down to Mobile to get us hot tea.  So anyway, basically a lot of nothing happened.  Finally we were called around 7:30 AM to move in line around the barricades.  We wove in and out till we reached the front door of the Javits Center where we were led through the halls and into a large room where about 5000 chairs were set up.  We filed in.  We then had to wait through hours and hours of nothing, although Nigel (the Executive producer of the show) gave a really good speech and run down.  He also was sweet enough to say that just because you weren’t picked today didn’t mean that you weren’t talented or worth anything but the producers you were auditioning in front of were looking for specific things and if you didn’t have those things then you would be told you were not what they were searching for… fair enough.  Everyone around got nervous and started freaking out if they had picked the right song but Erica, Caitlin and I just sat there tired and ready to sleep.  Nigel also said you would be going in front of one producer with two other auditionees, you would take turns singing and then the producer would tell you to go or stay.  He said that you wouldn’t be able to hear the people auditioning for any of the other 11 producers.  Remember this fact cause it was a huge lie.  Caitlin and I listened to people practice around them and we hummed to ourselves.  I had my olive oil and it was funny to see all the little things people did before they sang.  Some were myths I knew didn’t work while others had very good ideas I might steal now.  Oh, we were also told by Nigel there would be 10 to 12 producers auditioning us at one time depending on their lunch breaks.  So imagine our surprise at 11:30 AM when we were not far from auditioning and they told us they were taking a 30 min break for lunch.  COME ON!  Erica quickly called her dad to see if he would go get food for her, Caitlin and me.  By the time he got there though the place was already packed so we forwent lunch.  This was better anyway.  We didn’t need anything screwing up our voices.  But Caitlin and I had waited all day to have a cigarette and decided we were going to have one.  See the difference between Caitlin and I and all the other auditioners (with the exception of Erica) was even though we were taking this seriously we kind of like our lives so if we didn’t get in we would be just fine.  So we get back from lunch (or break for us) and they start moving people again.  We get in shortly, go stand in line and wait to go into the room.  Now I thought we were going to be in a room on our own with the producers or at least separated by large barriers… I was so wrong.  When I walked into the room I was immediately divided, Caitlin went off with another group and Erica, Jen and I were paired off.  Nigel took us over to our producer and had us stand and wait our turns.  The group before us was finishing up and they were all told to go home (in a nice way) and I knew right then that this was not a talent audition of any kind.  You see there were 12 stations in one large room and eleven other people were going to be belting our their songs at the same time you were at their stations.  There was no way the producer you were auditioning for would even be able to hear your audition.  Jen went first and she changed keys every five seconds and her tone was not good.  I felt bad for her knowing she’d be cut immediately.  Erica sang and was perfect, she was exactly what they were looking for and I was grinning knowing she would move on.  When I started, the key to my song was I knew I would be able to show what a strong singer I am even when I sing softly and then move into the belting part.  When I started I couldn’t even hear myself because of the eleven other people singing at the same time.  I knew the producer couldn’t hear me and then by the time I hit the belting part I had just given up and even though it was a good audition I didn’t look like the girls they were picking and I was a bit turned off because they weren’t looking for talent they were looking for characters on a television show.  I should have known this but somehow along the way I had just assumed they would at least fake the fact that they were looking for talent before anything else.  I finished up and he looked at Jen and I and said sorry, you’re not what we’re looking for and then looked at Erica and told her they would like her to come back for a call back.  I was so happy for Erica.  I think our whole group ran the gamut of emotions as Jen immediately burst into tears, Erica was flustered because she was so excited and I was like eh… I had a good run!  I was laughing on my way out while Jen was following me crying her eyes out.  When we got out to the loser area I felt bad for all the girls that were basing their whole worlds around it.  I waited to see if Caitlin was coming out.  She came out and told me that she had heard me across the room and that I had sounded really good.  She said that when she saw me walking out she didn’t care anymore and even though she had a good audition she didn’t have the heart.  I told her I was all excited cause I was waiting outside for her to not come out so I could find out she had made it!  How cool would that have been?!  So anyway, Caitlin comes out and is also laughing.  We, at this point, just want to go home.  Right before Caitlin came out Erica came out the wrong door and the camera crew was following her around everywhere, it was hysterical.  I told her she had to go somewhere else, she was so flustered though she didn’t know what was going on.  I eventually told her again to go upstairs and this time she listened.  In the meantime Stefan, Tiffany, Corey, and Adrienne all came out and no one was upset, we were like well, what are you gonna do?  When Caitlin came out she wanted to tell Erica how proud she was.  So we went upstairs to where the callback people went and she told Erica how proud she was.  Then we left.  And it was about time.  All we wanted to do was get to the hotel.  Needless to say the rest is boring.  We got food on the way home, went back to the hotel, booked a train out that afternoon, packed up and came home to regale our story for everyone who wanted to know.  All I have to say is Erica got in and she fully deserved it.  Now I expect to see her on the show and making it all the way to the end!  She could win it all.  She has that x-factor and I wish her the best of luck.  I on the other hand am now focused on getting my tape for Berklee together because I want that more than anything… far more than I ever wanted American Idol.  So don’t be sad for me, I didn’t want it badly enough I guess and I wasn’t the least bit upset when I got cut… it just meant I got to come home to you all :)
