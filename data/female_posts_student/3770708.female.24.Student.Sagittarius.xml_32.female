I feel somewhat embarrassed to admit it, as so many negative jokes are made about such programs and the people on them. I'm quite excited about it though; the online program has so many fun features and food tracking tools, it's like a game, one that will set me up for long-term lifestyle changes.   In an effort to earn myself some activity points for said diet, we tried to go swimming last night. Alas, the pool changed it's hours again, and we ended up wandering through the drug store for an hour (an activity which earned me 3 points anyway). Gavin, having slept for 3 hours that afternoon, was happy to run all about the store with me in pursuit, until at last he grew tired and we headed home for bed. I annoyed him quite a bit by refusing to let him throw everything within reach, and so he glowered at me from under his scrunched brow until I made the same face back at him and caused him to burst out laughing. He's been trying on these facial expressions to see how they work, which I feel is much preferable to temper tantrums. In most cases they work; I understand how he's feeling, talk to him about it, and generally come to a compromise. In this case he realized I was on to him, and we spent the next few minutes practicing angry faces while trying not to laugh. Then we practiced shock and surprise. He's so fun.
