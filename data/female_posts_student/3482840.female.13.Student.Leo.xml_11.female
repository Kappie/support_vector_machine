You can pretty much guess they're divorced. NEway, I spent yesterday watching TV ((Fairly Oddparents Channel Chasers!)) and playing with my Grandma's new kitten. She's all black so I wanted to name her Mystery, but Grams can't say that right so we named her Misty. She's so cute! =^_^=  We're skipping bible study @ church this morning b/c mommy has a bad headache. NOT my fault she's not used to the bar NEmore... loud, drunk ppl singing... Youch! But I hope we're going to service. Church is a lot more fun now. ^_^ But u know y! Well that's all 4 now! L8TR!!!
