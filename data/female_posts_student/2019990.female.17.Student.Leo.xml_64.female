I finished my pages for the most part, and parts of other peoples pages as well.  I got a Rent quote in the yearbook!  hooray!  And I found out that I'm an editor next year, and my co-editor is Valencia.  Which is who I was hoping for.  A good day definitly.  Oh, and I found the best picture of Mahinda for the Knowledge Bowl page.  You'll all just have to wait to get your yearbooks to see what it is though.  (hidden selling technique.  Brilliant)   Exciting, I jsut ordered a spelling Bee trophy for my "brag table" at my gradutation reception next year.  I'm so excited to make up my own awards.  Yey!  Someone gave me the idea to get awards with someone else's names on the m too, in something that isn't even offered here.  And I'm going to make a macaroni medal.  That's all for now.  See-ya.
