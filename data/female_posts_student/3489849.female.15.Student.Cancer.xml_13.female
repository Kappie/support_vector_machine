That includes the Kelz0rz Mix one and two! I hate to ask again but do you think you could make me two new ones? If not that's okay, but if u could it'd be greatly greatly greatly appresiated!   But anyway...speaking of my trip to Hawaii now is a good time to write about it.  So as you know in the very beginning i lost my cds...then the flight to Hawaii was good, until i noticed my Cd's were gone, i just about died!  So some highlights of our trip (so that i don't have to write everything out)....lesse i'll start with Oahu, didn't like it much, but it's cuz i had bad experiences there! #1. Got heat stroke very very badly and i was rly rly sick and stuck in the hotel room for a day.  #2. While i was sick apparently the people we were there with (The Gress Family) well yeah, their rental car got broken into and their 600 dollar video camera was stolen.  So then after 4 days in Oahu we went to Kauai for the last 10 days of our vacation.  Kauai was much better! My sister got stung by a jellyfish, i thought it was pretty funny cuz it was right in the middle of her chest. We also go to do the zipline up at like...Kanaka Falls or something and IT WAS THE COOLEST THING IVE EVER DONE!! It's about a 250 feet ride all the way and i did it totally upside down the whole time.  It was nothing but awesome!! We also went on snorkling tours, saw dolphins and turtles.  And...im tan! woohoo! I'll put in some cool pictures of my trip when i get around to it, we just got back today so dont really expect it too soon, guess what else...i haven't slept for over 28 hours! WHAT NOW BRITT AND LAURA! lol...i pulled an all nighter, thanks to the fact that i cannot sleep on an airplane no matter how hard i try. Toodles -Kelz0rz
