Such a blessing  Such a curse  Humans don't realize  just how glorious it is   But I know  Now that I have nothing else  Music is my only way  To escape  To get out  To be free  For awhile   Music sets me free  It takes me places  I could only imagine  And I long to share it with someone else  I wish I could just  float away  beyond space and time  with no rules and regulations  Just all by myself   Alone  Free  One   Music is my savior...
