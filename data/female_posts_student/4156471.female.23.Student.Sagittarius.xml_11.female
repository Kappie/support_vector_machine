They seems to be hanging out in the background wherever you look. On my way back I thought maybe just maybe the cafe across the street would be open .. IT was!!! Jen and Ben from MAPMES were sitting there so I picked up a drink and joined them beneath the tent lounging on pillows on the carpet laden ground. Bedouin style. They were heading over to the pool so I decided to join them.. so happy I did. This massive sport s complex is next doors and they had three pools... one for laps, one for play, and one for kids... tennis courts and stadium. Anyways so we tanned and swam away the day! SO much better then sitting in my empty room trying to keep myself awake. Tehy say that the best way to beat jet lag is to stay out in the sunshine. check! See if I can stay up til 11 tonight and maybe just maybe sleep the whole way throuhg. I also learned some hebrew by interpreting the labels of my mano nectar and my hommous.
