I am addicted to junk, but I am REALLY trying to eat healthy.  I thought my scale was going to like break today.  140.  That is higher than I have been in a LONG while.  I got down to 132.  Then...I ate.  Soon enough back up to 137 where I usually.  Now 140.  I won't let it get any higher.  I can't deal with that.  After exams I need to go to the gym.  I suppose weight gain weekend before exams actually probably isn't that uncommon for most people.  I studied so much today.  I feel like I know my Bio so incredibly well.  I have lots of questions to ask Mrs. J, but tomorrow morning I am going in for English review of comprehension and so I might go do Bio review later, but I will probably just go on Tuesday because I have my English final that day.  Ok so here is my dilemma.  Well actually it's like my feeling  inside, feelings I have had for a long time.  When I talk to people about how I feel, they think I am crazy, insane.  I don't care about that though, because I know I am not.  I am not stupid.  I also don't fail my subjects, but I sometimes (often if it's chem) fail quizzes or tests within my subjects.  I think I have some sort of learning problem.  Actually I am almost certain.  I feel different a lot of times.  Different in the way I do things.  Different in the way I learn things.  There are MANY reasons for these thoughts and feelings.  They are valid and significant, sometimes I wish people would pay more attention to them.  I know I am doing my best to learn and doing pretty good, but there are some adjustments that would make my life much less stressful.    why I believe there is a problem:   -I am a good reader, but don't understand what I read  -Come close or fail reading comprehension  -When able to take read comp. test alone in a room w/ out time restrictions I can score much higher then usual  -Study MANY hours, sometimes all night and space out study sessions and feel as though my marks don't match up with the effort I put in  -Don't have clear understanding of concepts, need to use pure memorization to take tests (ex. Social long answer) I memorize the answer to the questions we are given.  I NEVER actually understood the material, it just seems like I do cause of memorization  -Failed drivers ed, couldn't remember parts of car or what they do.  Have trouble learning rules of the road and actually driving.  My right-of-way judgment is still bad and the parking (no comment), but the driving is getting better.  -When people tell me things, I don't remember unless I write it down  -Some concepts I just can't seem to grasp no matter how hard I try and how much effort I put it (ex. Chemistry ice tables, some Math concepts)  -Have trouble understanding explanations in texts books and understand what Math word problems are asking  -When I was younger I could not tell time or count money (Ex. I remember trying to copy off of another girls tests cause I didn't know what any of the money represented)  -Take and long time to complete tests, feel rushed cause there is usually not enough time to think things through  -Excel and most sports and Drama related activities, but cannot grasp (some) not all concepts for Math, Bio, Chem, English, Social  -Marks ARE good, but because of effort and because I do ALL of my homework, which makes up for the bad test marks  -For years I had hardly any friends and had to stay in during recess (grade 6) to do assignments because they were not "good enough" even though I felt I had done my best.  It felt like a punishment, although I didn't know what I did wrong.  -Thought of suicide many times, about twice I have considered it on a serious level cause of the frustration and stress I have been though?  -Cry on and off many nights because I want to understand and finish my math, but it's frustrating and like foreign and finish chem but no matter what or how many explanations of get, I just can't seem to grasp the concepts  -Marks vary drastically Ex:(English Unit Work: 80%E, English Comp test: 52%) (Chem Quiz: 35%, Chem Lab: 100%, Chem unit test: 73%) (Math Unit Test: 80%, Math Unit Test:52%)  Can anyone say: INCONSISTENCY!  And I just try my best, and those are some of the marks I end up with: 35%, 59%, 45%...That isn't the kind of marks you would expect for a girl like me who works her ass off  -Spend hours and hours on homework, studying, cut out most extra-curricular to focus only on school  -Get anxious and stressed during test, homework is frustrating  -Feel like I need more time one-on-one to understand things.  Ex: Time in math when she sat down (actually many times in this specific unit that I kept asking over and over for help) with me to go through a whole bunch of stuff and I got 80% (highest unit test mark in math for me)  -Feel like I try more that others, work more than others, need help more than other people (A lot more help)  -My mother was born at a low birth rate and also had difficulty in school (I read that those born at low birth rates are susceptible to have problems learning, and I read that learning problems run in families)  Yeah the list just keeps going and going.  So yeah that is why I truly believe there is something wrong.  I wish I knew.  I feel so different or something.  No one struggles as much as I do, and I wish I knew why.  I wish someone could just tell me.  Come straight out and tell me.  I am not stupid.  I study, I work hard, but so many things in my life are frustrating, stressful, and to accomplish things I must go to extreme measures of hard work, hours studying, etc...
