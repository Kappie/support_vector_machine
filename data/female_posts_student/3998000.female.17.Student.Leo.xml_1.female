But even more, I wonder how many of our 8 year old selves would like to kick our asses for not being the cool grown-ups that we dream of becoming.   Everyone has that goal, whether they keep it to themselves or share it with the world, everyone has that one star in galaxies far, far away that they would give anything to make it to. And while some people may just ask for this star if they were given the opportunity to have anything they wanted, I think a lot of people would only take something that would put them in line with this star. Obtaining that star isn't the goal of life, its just the end mark, the finish line at the end of a triathalon, the moment of satisfaction when you can look back and say "I did it." I think most people would actually rather enjoy that long hard road to that far away twinkle of light. that's the idea that our 8 year olds wish to belive life is.   Much of society today lose that 8 year old mentality as soon as they hit double digits, realizing that life just isn't that simple.Those many meteors which tend to hit you in a new direction guide you to a new star. It may be just as far away as that twinkle that reflected in your eye only 2 years before, but it doesn't quite compare to the creme of the crop that you wanted so much not so long ago.   However, there is some good news. Once in a blue moon, someone will realize that meteors may be avoided, and that twinkle of a star can still reflect in your 8 year old eyes despite how close you are to triple digits. One in a blue moon, someone gets to that star they always wanted and it means so much to them to be able to look back on the wonderful meteors that they've encountered, overcome, and even dodged; and that twinkle in their eye is now a reflection on the star they started off from so far away.   I am not ashamed to admit I have a very big twinkle in my eye.This twinkleis not a reflection however it is the spark of the unknown. My destination isnothing more than an empty spaceand you may choose whether it is fortunate or unfortunate that it is probably the furthest of all. ForI wish to not only make it to the stars, but to become one. I say that one day I will make it big, everyone will know me, and I will be me, not the next Julia Robberts, Susan Sarandon, or Meryll Streep. I say this half because I am in denial, half because the world is in denial. There is no other choice than for me to achieve that dream and I hope that I will not let my meteors push me away from the twinkle my 5 year old eye had not so long ago. Seriously, who really wants to be pushed around by big dumb rocks?   That having been said, if I were given the opportunity to have anything I wanted, whether possible or impossible, I think I would be3 years older than I am today while still keeping my heart locked up in the 5 year old mentality that gives my eyes the twinkle of the future. As corny as all of this sounds, I believe it. As much as this resembles a valedictorian speech gone awry, its true. Its a shame that today most peopledon't push their limit.   And when I fall asleep at night, I am proud of my deepest impossible desire. I don't think I'm settling for less, and I don't think I'm taking away any of the long journey I have to obtain my star.           Bon soir.
