Is she starving for attention?  Is she going to commit suicide?  Are she and dad going to get a divorce?  She makes me so mad...  If they do it will be all her fault because she is such a bitch.  He brought her flowers yesterday or the day before the evening after their big fight.  Anyways, this afternoon I bought 2 new pairs of jeans while Father's Day shopping. :)  This is so completely awesome because I can never find long jeans that fit me!  *girl stuff*  And - wow - really good news is that I am not pregnant which is probably why I am in such a good mood.  I don't remember blogging about it, but I was completely wasted, messing around with some guy that I don't know...  I don't remember much, but then I skipped a period which really scared me.  So all is good!  Eek that was stressful.  Oh!  And I changed out my belly button ring today!  I wasn't supposed to for like another couple months (just like I wasn't supposed to go swimming lol), but it worked out!  I was scared because I thought that I would get out one of the rings and not be able to get another one in, but I got it in alright. :)  I changed it to the only other one I have - the dragonfly one.  I can't wait to go buy more!  That was another thing that worried me.  If I was pregnant, not only would my mom want to kill me over that, but then also she'd find out about the belly button ring.  Double whammy and ultimate grounding for the rest of my teenage life.  She'd turn into Cassie's Nazi parents...  I talked to Brian yesterday for the first time since I was back from Germany, and he was high...  I don't know what the hell is wrong with me, but I still really like that kid.  I love talking to him and being around him, but I hate that he smokes.  We talked while I was babysitting for a bit, and then I called him back later again, and we talked for an hour and a half until like 1 am.  I wish I could smack him and tell him to stop.  It pisses me off sooo much.  Grr ~ stupid boys.  So stressful!
