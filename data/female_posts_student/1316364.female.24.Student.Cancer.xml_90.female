I have been trying to use the AKO (ARMY Knowledge Online) Instant Messenger because Jesse has been having Issues with Yahoo ever since they upgraded their Email services. Well I figured that AKO would be a little more stable and that since AKO is used for military personnel that I probably wouldn’t have problems with attracting the wrong type of people like I have been on yahoo. Well today I was wrong. I met this guy on AKO and he asked if he could call me to talk, I told him sure why not but only if he promised to keep it on the clean side. He said sure… so about 20 minutes later he called and after one minute of conversation with him I was pretty sure of what his intensions were. I just wish that I didn’t attract these people. I love Jesse and I don’t understand what would give these guys the idea that if they said some stupid pickup line, I would throw away 6 ½ years of a relationship away for a cheesy pick up line, please!  Most of the time all I am looking for is someone to talk to and nothing more. And for some reason they just don’t see that, no matter how many times I type it out for them in plain English.  What am I going to do?
