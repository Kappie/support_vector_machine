Well, Austin's mom died when he was 4 so we were talking about something and this happened.   ~Austin -Me :My Mom  ~I think my Dad should get a girlfriend :What kind of girlfriend? ~A pregnant one -A what?! ~Pregnant, when a girl is pregnant, doesn't she have a baby? :Yeah... ~Then that's the kind he should get -Austin, you have brothers and a sister ~Well, they're not at my house a lot, I want one that's always with me :Austin, baby's don't come out ready to play with, they cry and you have to change their diapers ~Oh yeah, that's right :Does she have to be pretty? ~Not real pretty, but on the day they get married she should be :All girls are pretty on their wedding day ~She should like racecars too   Then later on we were talking about Hawaii again  ~I'm going to live in Hawaii :That's what I hear, why? ~Its nice there, and you can swim all the time :Really, what are you going to do there ~I'm going to be a racecar driver and work at a restaurant -Like, be a waiter? ~Yeah, and a racecar driver :Are you going to go to college and study to be a mechanic? ~Yeah, probably :I think that would be a good idea because waiter is kind of what you do in college, not for your whole life ~Oh yeah... -Are you going to get married and have kids? ~Yeah, if I find someone in Hawaii
