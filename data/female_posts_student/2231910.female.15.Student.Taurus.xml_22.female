My classmate keep asking me whethet i am okay, but i just say "Ya... i am ok! ". What is going wrong at me, i begin to hate my life. Why must it be me who keeps suffering like tat and not speaking up. Why not them but me. I hate myself, i dun noe why just hate it. I wonder how long must i stay like that for? Rest of my life? Crying is all i am good in when i am sad.
