I am so glad my friends didn't let my stupidity throw this away.  i am glad we are still together.  The kids are good, they ahve been getting into a lot of trouble.  I feel bad for them because they ahve so many adults to answer to, as if having one set of parents aren't enough...haha  Have a nice rest of the week...Ed has Friday off...YAY!
