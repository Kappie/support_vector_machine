Just one more week, my first exam will come, gosh, I hope I can manage to do some revision before the exam. Yeah, I'm turning to be a  kiasu  girl!      Kinda frustrated about myself. I think I'm too proud and selfish sometimes. Just like few days ago, we were required to write down few points for the MUET speaking question in 30 minutes, and I couldn't think of one point to support my idea. I thought I was good in this kind of thing, but as a result, I'm not! I'm still need to improve myself, I can't stop right now...      That's all, still have tonnes of homework to finish, tata.
