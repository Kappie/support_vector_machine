M3r posters have reportedly been removed by Hatters as well as numerous young liberal posters going missing. This can be blamed on stupid students as well, who don't get the joke. Overall however there is a complete lack of respect for these poster campaigns and the the removal of them amounts to nothing less than a stifling of our freedom of speech.  Poster the shit out of PHSC about anything you care about or want to get across. We should not have to ask for the teachers permission. Its our fundamental right. FIGHT FOR IT !
