(sorry mags girls , and everyone in general.. this must be boring).. i didnt really talk to any guys in grade school other than blake... who i am suprised to say i actually miss... i havent talked to him in at least a year... (speaking of guys... jon fitch is still unbelievably hot... anywho).. wow i ramble alot but ill keep going cause i have nothing else to do... sarah.. simply a unique person (with a smelly little sister).. shrek... setting off her smoke alarm almost daily... fun times... i'll finish this "little" posting by talking about the only two friends from sms that i am still close to (and will hopefully always be)... it amazes me that three people as different as we are can be so amazingly close... laura has her roger ( whom i can never thank enough for making laura the happiest that she's probably ever been) and E.H. and all that comes with it (including so much drama) .... rae has her volleyball, j.o., softball, ect. (it never ends) and her E.C. (she has an unbelievable number of friends there..she is quite get-along-able)  and they both have social lives (something i seem to lack) ....the amazing relationship i have had with these girls over the years proves to me thast there is a god... i dont know how i would survive without them... i might not see them for weeks at a time but i always know that they're there for me and that as soon as i do see them again, my problems will go away (i hope i mean the same to them)... i could go on for pages trying to describe what they mean to me but no amount of words can really say it... i am the luckiest person in the world... omg this post is soo long... so ill just end by thanking everyone in my life that i call friends... you mean the world to me..... much love (and to my loreli and my rae rae, kiss kiss darlings...)
