They struck me as particularly poignant, but that rest of the song kinda sucks.   I suppose I was in a kind of dreary mood yesterday, mostly because Matt is out of town and I basically worked the entire day.  Not so much fun.   I'm in one of those stages where I'd just like to rip out my hair, as too much is going on that I can't control, and I just want a little more order in my life.  I have too much to do in too little time, I don't have plans for July worked out quite yet, and I'm going to be having serious financial difficulties if I don't get the funding that I applied for.  But I won't know if I have the money until after I've left for Montenegro.  Sigh.  I'm going to email the places I applied to and find out if there's any way that I can hear back before Apr 3 (as both said they'd let you know by Apr 15).   One of my neighbors (there are 8 apartments in my building) stopped by this morning because he had locked himself out of his apartment in his slippers and jammies (he was taking laundry down), and it was barely above freezing outside.  He was not so happy.  And since he had people's phone numbers in his cell phone, which was in his apartment, he wasn't entirely sure what to do.  But after about 15 tries, he finally got ahold of his advisor, who was nice enough to stop by the office and pick up the guy's spare set of keys.  I don't know if my profs would have been nice enough to do that early on a Sunday morning.
