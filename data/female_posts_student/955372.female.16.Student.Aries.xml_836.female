That political stock market thing, where they bet on whether Middle-Eastern leaders will be assasinated, or when terrorist attacks will occur in the Middle East is the most DISGUSTING and TWISTED thing I have EVER heard of in my entire life. It is absolutely appalling. It literally makes me sick. Turning the turmoil, suffering, murdering in the middle east that people deal with everyday into a fucking game. It's like betting on horses, only instead of horses it's people's LIVES. That is so wrong on so many levels. And it's run by the PENTAGON. As in, OUR GOVERNMENT. wow. Sure makes you want to put a hell of a lot of confidence in our country's leaders doesn't it. Just think about. Making money off of someone being murdered. Doesn't that just kind of hint at hit man. Isn't it just a little reminiscent of something the MAFIA would do. Some kind of pool the black market would have. Oh speaking of our lovely American Values based government, has anyone heard about this new thing the republicans are trying to get. It's monitoring what books people buy or borrow from the library. If that doesn't SCREAM invasion of privacy, I don't know what does. It's another "terrorist provension" techniques. Think about that though, monitoring what you read. Big Brother is watching. Who knows what's next? Book burning perhaps? Wouldn't want to give the American public any bad ideas. Wow. da na na na da na na na...You are now entering the Twilight Zone...
