I love it that you make me actually think about things, instead of just pass them by like I would be doing. And you usually don't even know you're doing it. Sir, you're my Plan B. As in, you're always there for me to fall back on after I run ahead and trip. You inspire me as well, and Siam, I know you're there for me too, but when I think about it, these are the things that I love most about you. Just wanted to remind you guys that I appreciate you, and I love you. Cheesepuff  p.s. - I composed this while thinking about you in the shower. Aren't I sexy.
