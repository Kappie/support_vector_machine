That movie follows my theories exactly, like the whole chaos theory it was based on.  Something like the flutter of the wing of a butterfly could result in a typhoon on the other side of the world.  I am a firm believer in stuff like that, any time someone wants to debate that I would be happy to.  Like small tiny things that happen can cause huge things to no matter how small the connection.  It's great isn't it? I wanna see that movie again, I loved it.  haha I just thought of something funny that happened today at dinner. My mom and my dad got calamari and my dad was talking about it and all of a sudden he says, "Wow it's amazing how many testicles they gave us" of course meaning tenticles.  His face turned bright red and robyn and I could not stop laughing.  That wasn't it later he picked up one of them and said (unknowingly of course), "Wow this puss is really big!" HAHAHA (sorry dad I had to put it in! =S ) so, that was wicked wicked funny...
