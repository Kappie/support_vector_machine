Today I subbed for a kindergarten class. They are cute. It's not that subbing makes me not want to have kids exactly (I mean, hopefully I wouldn't be having 25 kids all at the same time), and it is my fault I can't control them . . . . but it wears me out. I have to come home and stuff myself. Good thing I'm going to the gym soon.   We went to the Wing Stop and got really yummy tasting lemon pepper wings. I mean, holy cow, they are like sexy Australian men good. And totally goddess happiness at the same time.   They'd better pay me for such fabulous advertising. The honey barbecue wasn't any good at all though. I should read my book a little now. Open the windows. My antique peach roses that G.E.T. bought me are still lovely. Too bad they must suffer in my incredibly eclectic and cluttered room.
