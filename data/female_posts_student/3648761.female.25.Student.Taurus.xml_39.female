He promised that he would lay off the working and apologized.  He is planning on taking us on vacation pretty soon here to go somewhere.  He said he missed me and he is doing this for us. At this point I felt kinda bad about all the drama, because he has his prioritys on straight.  This weekend my best friend uncle died, just out of the blue very weird. I have to go to a wake tonight.  I feel extra bad because my same friends anut passed away out of the blue also about 1 year ago, and now her husband passed.  Very strange just to go like that they weren't very old either, in their mid 50's.  I talk to Brad this weekend, just to get a males prepictive this weekend, and this is when I felt like an asshole because his uncle passed away.  He kinda thanked me because he wanted to get his mind off things.  Love ya Brad!
