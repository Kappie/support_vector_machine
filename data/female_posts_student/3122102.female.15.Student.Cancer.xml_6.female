So, natasha said that she is with me at century sq doing some shopping. Den this is what he said, " ook, fine. Whateva. You alwayz listen to ur so called 'good friend'. WHO is he to say that to me. Natasha doesn't even like him, that GOOD FOR NOTHING JERK!! If i could, i would spit at his face that natasha is just using him..You gotta see the look on his face if i say this to him but i kept a promise to natasha to not tell him. So i kept my finers crossed. I HATE THE SIGHT OF HIM!! ARGH!!!!
