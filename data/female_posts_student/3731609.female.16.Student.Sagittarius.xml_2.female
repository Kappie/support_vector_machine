They hit me so hard I spun around...kind of scary.  The mother of the girl who was driving was really rude about it, but the daughter (who didn't have her license yet) asked if I was okay.  They took me to the hospital because a witness said my head was flopping around, even though I didn't want to.  Maegan called me as I was sitting in my car sobbing.  After I told her that I had been in an accident she ran about a mile to come get my car so it wouldn't be towed.  Then she came to the hospital to keep me company because my mom was out of town working.  Some other friends (Andy, Nick, Jonny, and Josh) showed up as well.  It was nice knowing that I have friends like that.  They made me laugh.  Maegan's dad also showed up to take care of me I guess.  I really owe them but I'm not sure what I can do to repay them.  Any suggestions?  Oh and Andy's mom bought me flowers and left them on the porch today...how sweet.
