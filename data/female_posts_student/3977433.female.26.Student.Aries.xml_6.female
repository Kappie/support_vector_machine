We hung out after until I had to go to work, and played with Wish and Gus. Laura likes to giggle. A lot.       I went to work for an hour, and I talked with the deli ladies. There is this one very pretty small girl named "katie"? I'm not sure of her last name, but she's sooooo quiet. I always say hi to her, and she is just so mousy. It's sweet. If she was older, she'd be mine.       Anywho, I'm off to find things to do. I bought some more shirts, one that says 'playgirl' on it. And a movie called "If these walls could talk". I hear the series of movies is quite good so I'm looking forward to watching it later.        I am still not sure what I'm doing this weekend, so if anyone is interested in hanging out, please let me know. I'll probably know by Friday... and I think there are a few things that I'd like to do like shopping or going out. It all depends on what kind of mood I'm in... and how people decide to treat me.           Feeling: Happy Watching: YR
