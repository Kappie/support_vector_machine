My -_- dad helped me to make a new Ezlink card, it cost $30 for a lost card ! ! o_0 Other than that, my library card is ' terminated ', I will have to pay $1 for a new library card. Boy, everything cost so much nowadays... And I am STILL sad over my wallet, it cost $10, and I still never tell my parents I lose $27 in cash, I told them I lose $7... :p
