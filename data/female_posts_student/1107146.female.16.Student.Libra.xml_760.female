(few minutes later) I have a question. L: I have an answer.  Let's see if they match. R: What's the answer? L: No, question has to come first, that's the way things work. R: I think we've come to that point in our relationship (blah blah blah)... Will you be my girlfriend.  Sorry about asking online, but I'm a wimp face to face. L: Of course, don't worry about being a wimp.  And then the convo took a turn so we weren't talking about that anymore.  And I was behind him on the way home and he smiled at me and made my day cause he kind of ignored my existence today.  I'm rambling, so I'll shut up now.  He hasn't posted on his blog in over a month now.  *Sigh*  Oh, well.  I'm off now that I've bored you all to death.
