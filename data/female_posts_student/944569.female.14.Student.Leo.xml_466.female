Is it like the sky to the dove Could that be love? A rare and pretty scene What could it possibly mean? Is it like the river to a shore? Could that be amour? Meant to be together  wherever forever? devotion, emotion, enchantment, inclination? partiality, pash, passion, piety, infatuation? A heart for one to woo Love, where are you?
