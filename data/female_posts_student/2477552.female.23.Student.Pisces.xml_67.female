I woke up this morning in quite a mood, got in two fights with my grandma over language and my mcd hat. I came home at lunch only to call the michigan testing center to try to find out my test scores. The scores weren't going to be reported online until five o'clock today. I had to go back to work and be anxious the whole day. I got off work at four, drove around the block listening to Ricky Martin's Living La Vida Loca. I finally drove home, parked the car, and took a shower. I couldn't stand it. I had to know. And then, when I thought that I could finally go online at home (and not at the library because I misplaced my library card and didn't want to look for it) my gram said I should wait until after dinner to ask auntie if I could go back online tonight to check on my test scores (I got in trouble for using her aol minutes extraneously). So, finally tonight at 7:15 p.m. I went online and checked my aol email.  I passed my Geography subject area test. I passed my English major subject area test. I passed all three sections of the MI Basic Skills Test, (reading, mathematics, and writing). I even aced the writing portion.  How awesome is that!!! I am positively elated. I called my aunts, my bosses at work, and my supporting work-friends.  So what does this all mean?  All I have to do is my student teaching and I could get a job. How awesome is that!!!!!! I am soooo happy! I should have absolutely no problem getting into the school of ed, (I apply in Sept). And that means that I could apply to teach summer school for the school district!!! Oh, I am soo happy! :)  Thanks to all of my friends  and family who were so positive and supportive during all of this. You guys mean so much to me. I am going to sleep so well tonight! :)
