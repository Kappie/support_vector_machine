Yeah, yeah, believe it or not, the kid with the lipstick knows how to build stuff..." -Davey Havok   [ i'm having a profound neufeldian moment. i'm listening to the tragically hip while reading some rather avant-gardepoetry which makes it all to apropriate to be listening to this song. and yes, i am most definatly over analyzing this poetry, your know, in a true neufeld way. i'm begining to miss school. not school itself,butthe daily regeem, the people (kids and teachers alike), the conceptof doing something worth while each day. (song change-- nautical disaster) i have this absurd urge to both cry and re-enact our drama skit to to nautical disaster.this song is so bloody depressing. yet it's a work of art seeing as they wrote this song, capturing the emotion perfectly, without ever experiencing it themselves. well, things to do, people to dream, see you all in the morn.
