I am, to a certain extent, a Christian myself. But these guys are just crazy. For instance, they are fucking homophobes, which i have absolutely zero tolerance for. Second, on their website (which happens to be UTTER BULLSHIT) they state that "The only true Nazis in this world are fags." Excuse moi, but how are homosexuals nazis? Most of them don't try to force homosexuality upon other people, they just want to be accepted. Also, when Hitler discovered that his right hand man was homosexual, he immediately shot him point blank. Nazis' hate homosexuals.   Also they say "Thank God for 9/11". The part about the homophobia made me feel angry, made me feel like throwing up, but this, in addition to their disgusting and hateful message, made me come close to tears. My cousin would have DIED in that attack if he didn't call in sick with a sore throat. He would have fucking died along with 3,000 other innocent people, and they're saying THANK GOD FOR 9/11???? These guys (and girls) are fucking sickos. They're one of the things that makes me truly angry. The kind of anger that biulds up in my heart and makes me see red. The kind of anger that makes me want to scream and cry. The kind of anger that hurts so much that I have no idea what to do about it. The anger that inspires me to write rambles such as this one. You know, I might go to Hell (if there is a hell), as much as i pray that i don't. But when 666 Satan Lane is occupied by this Fred Phelps and his fucked up buddies, they'll realize what I've known all along: they're wrong. Period.
