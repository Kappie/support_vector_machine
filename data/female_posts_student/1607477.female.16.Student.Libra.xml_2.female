When they told me about it I didn’t know what to say, I was shocked that one ex talked to another ex, then the fact that a bet was made kinda hurt. So one ex has been text messaging me all night about how much loved me, and how he would change. When I called to talk to him about it he told me about the bet. I didn’t know what to say, I didn’t know how to feel. I still don’t know how to feel. Maybe confused is the best way to go for me, since I seem to always find myself confused. Well Michael Ruffin got my number tonight and I got his, we are going to be spending 9 days together since we are both going on world changers. I thought it would be good to have him as a bus partner since it will be a 13 hour drive. He is cool and very sweet. But back to this bet thing, I kinda hurt since I apologized profusely on that last entry to Addison and he turned around and did that to me. I guess he had a right I don’t know; I’m not very good with these kinda things. Lately it seems like I’ve had a lot of drama, ever since camp really. Maybe God is trying to tell me something, I just don’t know what it is yet. I got two new fish today, they were a dollar. It was fun bugging Powell. Samantha got a black cat they named her Boo. We spent forever in B today and last night. Oh my ex found out about me and Samantha wanting to hang out with Mark and Rowdy last night, I guess he kinda has the right to be mad. I don’t know I don’t think I can say this enough to him, LEAVE ME ALONE. It’s like it never really sinks in. My mom yelled at me all the way home so for those of you that have my cell phone number I wouldn’t suggest calling it anymore since I probably wont have it for about another 2 months. I will most likely get it back when I start to drive and can’t afford the excess cost of text messages and minutes that I’ve gone over. I just thought of something, “ You reap what you sow” I’m kinda thinking this is what I sowed and now I’m getting it back, kinda like Karma ya know? My life could be a soap opera; some times I wish it was so that way it wouldn’t all be real. I’m at the realization point of my life. I realized that I need to keep my mind on the right track and pay attention to my surroundings and the little advice I get along they way helps too. I can’t ever decide if I am happy being alone or if I would rather have a boyfriend. For a while I wanted Lee, one of my best friends. I thought he would be the perfect guy for me, but I realized that I loved him too much as a friend and I knew it wouldn’t work out. I leave for world changers on Friday morning. I am so glad I get to have 9 days away from Mobile. I am miserable here. My heart is in D.C. I cant wait I only have two years left here, The day after graduation I’m getting as far away from Mobile as possible. Who knows where I will go, just as long as its far. I have a habit of running away from things, some of you reading this ( if you have read this far) might know about that habit. When I get scared I run , I run from my problems, it feels better that way, I guess because I don’t really have anyone that understands, I mean my best friend Samantha sorta understands and helps me out a lot but no one seems to fully understand the way I think, I don’t even understand how I think. It’s hard to not have someone to talk to without hearing “ I know, I’m sorry, It’ll be ok”. Many people don’t realize that when someone close to them is hurt they tend to say the same things over and over again to try to console their friend or family member.  The day someone really understands me, they will have the answers to my problems and know exactly what to say, but I think there is only one person that will ever understand that, and He is waiting for me in Heaven. There is a reason all of the things that have happened tonight, have happened. It’s part of God’s plan, and its time to wake up and realize it. I’ve been rude to a lot of people lately, mainly because of my own problems. I need to say sorry to Jon, I’ve been selfish to you and I’m so sorry! I hope you forgive me coz at this point I need as many friends as possible. I’m kinda low in that department. I miss camp a lot because I could relate to them, and everyone was nice to everyone, I guess it wasn’t really the real world, more like a fantasy world. I have made a big step to take down my Eminem posters, he’s kinda tacky anyway, he’s just junking up my wall. I’m ready to escape my problems, if anyone knows a remedy for problems and a broken, confused girl then please let me know, I’d like to be informed. Have you ever noticed that when you are in a different place, every problem big or small just seems to disappear? I guess when you are in a different surrounding you tend to forget what you left back home because you don’t wanna go back to being sad or what not. I would like to be happy for once, I should be I have so much more than some people, but it seems like I’m not satisfied there is sounding missing, sounds crazy right? Ask yourself one question... why am I still reading this? You’ve read a lot why are you still reading? Is it because reading or hearing about other peoples problems makes you feel better, makes you feel like your issues are so small compared to this crazy girl! I don’t blame you if that’s what you’re thinking. I am ready to get my movie project started that way I can focus on one thing. Some of you may have heard me say this sometime, “My life is a merry-go-round. I am sitting on the animal and every time I go up and back down it’s a new problem, but one day I will be sitting in one of the chairs that ride smoothly around life’s little up’s and down’s, but until then I have to hold on tide and pray that I don’t fall off” I guess this entry has gone a little long, but if your still reading this that’s the thought I want to leave you with, have a good night, and remember hold on when life gets bumpy, everything will be smooth eventually.
