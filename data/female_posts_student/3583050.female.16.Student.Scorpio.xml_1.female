It is a new environment with many unprecedented events and surprises coming my way. In an awkward way, i am looking forward in learning new things, knowing new friends yet prefering stagnantion.3 months have passed with little progress in my life. Everyday is a repeating cycle, sleep late wake up late. Then, look for something to eat or wait for someone to buy it for me otherwise i'll try to cook up anything from the kitchen. Its either junk or not eating anything followed by random surfing of the net then relieving some joy from my xbox games till my mom comes home. I would chat,watch tv, dine with her and sometimes with bro. Getting back some deprivation of fun in my life by staring at my dog or playing with it. Dilly-dallying till i fall asleep. What's worse is that i thought since i am not going to get a job for 3 months i would self-upgrade myself. I promised myself that i would read many books,newspapers that are related to politics,philosphies,business or issues that increases my general knowledge. On top of that, i would learn a lot of vocabulary, write complex sentences. As you can see how i am writing, i had made little or near no progress. i guess even if i want to turn back time i'll still not carry out my promises. Its funny how i would have all that drive and energy to deliver my promises but lose it all in a while. I think i am sad excuse for being human. I have no proud successes in life to inspire others. I shall stop all this self-procrastination.  LET'S LOOK FORWARD TO THIS NEW SCHOOL TERM WITH HOPE OF MAKING LITTLE SUCCESSES IN MY LIFE AND RUB IT THEIR FACES.   here's a little quote i read from newsweek during nature's call:  "The test of a first-class mind is the ability to hold two opposing views...at the same time and still retain the ability to function, "F.Scott Fitzgerald
