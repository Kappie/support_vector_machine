I thought about you. I thought about the times we spent together. Even tho it was a very short amount of time but I too still think of you.   I thought about "TUESDAY". I decided the night before. How can I not? Me and you. Enjoying sweet charming conversations over delicious food. We've blushed before, but I never really took you seriously. It's always harder on me, I'm always hurt after we meet. You??? You just go on. You go on as if nothing happened, as if I was never there.   I finally realized it now. I gave you my all and you didnt appreciate it. I turn and walked away. They say, never look back because it will only hurt you more. I'm a lil hurt, but not as much as before. No, not nearly as much. I'm going to move on into bigger and better things. I'M SO OVER YOU.
