I was invited to Nicole's best friend, Mindy's, thirteenth birthday/slumber party and I haven't got the chance since then to type to you about my thoughts and stuff. I'll type to you all about the party and the events that occurred afterwards, of course...   Three days ago  I was invited to Mindy's thirteenth birthday party. I wasn't all that excited to tell you the truth. Mindy isn't a very good friend towards my sister. She treats her like she's her personal slave. Nicole MUST listen to her and conform with her opinions. Honestly, she is a complete jerk. She calls her "best friends" awful names and thinks that she is the greatest. I didn't really want to go to her birthday party when she acted like a complete ass hole to my sister. I also didn't want to go because I wasn't really her friend, much less her best friend. Well, Nicole had promised Mindy that she'd go no matter what. I really didn't want to go, as I typed in the previous sentences, but I thought that it was best if I went. Nicole could certainly not be left alone with Mindy. I joked to everyone that I was going for free chocolate cake, pizza, and ice cream. I didn't want them to know that I was worried for my sister. To be truthful, I was scared that people would find out that I'm not as cold and uncaring as I appear.   More people showed up at the party  then I believed that there would be. Most of them were people that Mindy's aunt invited or her relatives. The only person that I knew was Sarah. (She had come solo because Bridget was sick.) Mindy introduced us to several people, including a twelve year old tomboy named Morgan, a thirteen year old nonconformist named Terri, and a fourteen year old "loser" named Matt. We changed into our bathing suits and hopped into Mindy's aunt's pool.   The pool was heated . I didn't go under water much. The chlorine stung my eyes painfully. In fact, I didn't really move all that much. Personally, I hate swimming. Well, I don't hate it. In fact, I love settling down on my bum on the bottom of any given pool and watch the bubbles from my mouth float to the top, the transfixed world lie above me, and how the water ripples when the other people in the pool move. I guess I just don't like actually SWIMMING in a pool. Especially in one that was jampacked with complete strangers and a not so friendly "friend."   My hands were shriveling  when we finally got out of the pool. It had felt like hours had passed. Everyone went inside and changed. Then we all stood in Mindy's aunt's kitchen and ate our dinners. I had a cheeseburger despite the fact that I want to be a vegetarian. It was a merry time. Sarah had a lot of soda and was talking up a storm with the other kids. She was asking me questions a mile a minute whenever they left to get more food. After dinner we had cake and ice cream.     Present time arrived  shortly after. Mindy opened up all of her gifts and loved nearly every one of them despite the fact that they were rather cheap, bought at the last minute type of gifts. Her most favorite gift of them all, however, was a brand new cell phone. She almost cried with happiness.   We moved our sleeping things into the motor home  that we were to sleep in that night.   Terri, Morgan, Sarah, Nicole and I  were spending the night. Matt had to leave because Mindy's parents were old fashioned and just plain disliked the idea with one boy and six girls. We watched a really corny movie that Mindy got for her birthday before Terri, Morgan, and Sarah went for another swim. Nicole and I listened to Mindy as she talked about stuff for roughly over an hour. It was mainly about her cell phone.   Then Sarah came back  from swimming. Mindy rushed out of the motor home for some weird reason. Sarah, Nicole, and I were left alone. It didn't take too many goofy remarks and funny stories before we all became serious and silent. Sarah broke the tension by confessing that Bridget told her everything that I told her. She began crying. She thought that we'd be furious with her and her sister. Cole and I shushed her. We told one another about basically what anyone says to us. How could we get angry at her for that? It just wasn't logical. We would have done the same.   Before we knew it  we were spilling our deepest, darkest secrets to one another. Sarah started to cry. Nicole comforted her and told her it was all right. I just sat there. Sarah and Bridget were as miserable as I was. They actually pitied Nicole and I, and hated themselves for thinking that they had it bad. Suddenly I felt like laughing.     Your pain is always different compared to the next  person. People can only go on for so long before they crack. Some are stronger then others and can deal with a lot more tramatizing events before they break... Others can't deal with it and fall a part easily.   People feel things differently then you.  I felt like laughing because I knew that just because I've faced more obstacles to overcome in my life then Sarah and Bridget, doesn't mean that I've been more miserable then they have.   We all became closer  from our little discussion. Soon Terri, Morgan, and Mindy came back. We spent endless hours giving each other make overs and playing truth or dare.     Mindy didn't really participate  in any of our games. She played on her cell phone the entire time, trying out ring tones. Soon, Terri and the rest of us had, had enough. We tried desperately to convince Mindy to join us but she would not put down the cell phone. We tried so hard to capture her interest that she got fed up, swore at us a couple of times, and shut herself up in a cabinet. Terri, Morgan, Sarah, and I left to a different part of the motor home while Nicole tried to soothe the angry Mindy.     Morgan, Terri, Sarah, and I  talked the night away while Mindy, after Nicole had helped to heal her angry thoughts, played on the cell phone in the other room. Everyone didn't go to sleep 'til about four thirty in the morning. Since I forgot my medication, I was up 'til about six in the morning, though.   Terri and Morgan  left early the next morning. Sarah, Nicole, and I waited in silence for Mindy, who was still sleeping soundly, to wake up. Mindy's aunt ended up having to wake her up. Mindy called her aunt several crude names before getting out of bed.   We didn't have breakfast  which I was sort of dissapointed at. Nicole, Sarah, and I packed up our stuff and threw it into Mindy's dad's van instead. He drove us to the local cinema where we watched the movie, The Village. The movie was awesome in my opinion. It was so mind bending. I loved it. It twisted your thoughts and made you think which I love doing. Thinking is one of my most favorite past times. Throughout the movie Sarah gripped onto my fingers every time she got scared which was an awful lot may I add. She has the death grip I swear. I didn't mind it all that much though. I mean, she's so nice and understanding to me. She also gave me this lovely necklace that has a a golden, flying bird with a pink belly. I might as well let her squeeze my hand during a "frightening" movie...   Mindy's dad drove us home  after the movie. Sarah called us about twenty minutes after we got home to go to the mall to windowshop with her and Bridget, who was feeling much better at the moment. We instantly replied yes. A couple of hours were spent at the mall looking at various objects before Cole and I bought them dinner at the mall's food court. After we went over to their house and recordered talk shows and soap operas until about ten o'clock at night. Finally, at a little after ten, we returned to our home and went to bed.   Today we were supposed to go bowling with them  and maybe a few other of their friends. We didn't though. Nicole and I ended up going out to Burger King and the city library with our granny. We missed their call. It's okay though. I'm all right with it. I love Sarah and Bridget dearly though. (As friends, of course!) They know my entire past and like me anyways. I know their past and like them anyways as well. They feel for me. They're also very easy to talk to, unlike Katelyn and Chloe are to me. I mean, Chloe and Katelyn just aren't the type of friends that want to talk about things that I talk to Bridget and Sarah about. I like them too, and I thought that they were my best friends, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they aren't my best friends, perhaps Sarah and Bridget are. Yes, Sarah and Bridget definitely are...   Kate, you know, my new ex best friend, AIMed me  today. She told me that Hal died. (Hal's a fifty five year old guy that made old fashioned cars, who lived on our street until he died from a heart attack a few days ago.) Unlike she usually is, Kate was nice. She asked me a few questions and before I knew it we were goofing off and teasing one another like we used to. We slipped back into friendship.   Kate, Nicole, and I were going to go play outside together  but my dad unexpectedly announced that we were going out to dinner, right now, at that very second. We tried calling her but the line was busy. She wasn't outside yet and she wasn't online anymore. My dad, majorly frustrated and angry, yelled at us to get into the car. We obliged and sadly, left Kate to wait for us outdoors.   My dad was irritated  and when my dad is irritated, it is not pretty. He blew up at us all. I could sense that dinner wasn't going to be great. However, with a little charm, I got him to lighten up. Dinner was a lot of fun, fortunately...   Things have become "weird"  now. I'm questioning my friendships with everyone. Bridget and Sarah are more of my best friends then my "BFF's" are... It's just weird. Kate being my friend again sort of terrifies me and that's for a reason that I can not even type here for an unreasonable fear I contain inside my mind... Everything just feels "different."  Well, I'm gone.  Austa.
