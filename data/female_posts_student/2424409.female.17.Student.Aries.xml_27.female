There's no one here to talk to And the pain inside is making me numb.  I try to hold this under control, They can't help me, cause no one knows.  Now I'm goin' through changes, changes. God, I feel so frustrated lately. When I get suffocated, save me. Now I'm goin' through changes, changes  Feelin' weak and weary Walkin' through this world alone Everything they say every word of it Cuts me to the bone, (and I bleed)  I've got something to say But now I've got nowhere to turn It feels like I've been buried Underneath all the weight of the world.  I try to hold this under control, They can't help me, cause no one knows. Now I'm goin through changes, changes God, I feel so frustrated lately  When I get suffocated, save me. Now I'm goin' through changes, changes  I'm blind and shakin', bound and breakin' I hope I'll make it, through all these changes.  Now I'm going through changes, changes God I feel so frustrated, lately When I get suffocated, save me. Now I'm falling apart, now I feel it.  But I'm going through changes, changes. God I feel so frustrated, lately. And I get suffocated, I hate this. But I'm going through changes, changes.
