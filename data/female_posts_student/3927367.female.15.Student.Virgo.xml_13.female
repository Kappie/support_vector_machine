There was someone there that I have never gotten along with, but limited interaction with her kept me good. This morning I was on call (babysitting) for a very special woman I know. I thought that the latest I could be back was 4, so that I could go to a movie with my friends. Come to find out, they were all busy later, so they had to go to the 1 o'clock showing. I didn't find this out until noon, when my mom called me at the peoples house that I was babysitting at. She said that Tyler had tried to call me telling me that they were going at one and no later. This really upset me. That is actually an understatement. I nearly broke out in tears infront of the girls that I was taking care of, but I was able to hold it in. I kept hoping that the girls' mom would get back before 1, but no such miracle occurred. She got home at 1:15, I was home by 1:20. I was devastated. When I got home, my parents and the little ones were all packed up and getting ready to leave for wenatchee. They left, which left me alone. I looked for my drumline music folder...And never found it. I searched this whole damn house, and never found it. Tyler called during my frantic search, and the tears that had been threatening to come all day finally found an exit. We didn't talk much, but just knowing that he was there helped a little. I had to get off the phone, and I resumed my search. Again, to no avail. Cassidy came home not long after. She told me about her day, then listened to mine. She then decided that we needed to watch a movie together. She chose finding nemo, and I fell asleep on the couch with her sleeping head in my lap. When I woke up, I had that same sense of hopeless nothingness. Also, this whole time it had been raining.  I  didn't miss it because I wasn't in a movie theater, but it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. So, in summary so far, I had babysat, felt rejected by my friends, left by my family, lost the most important thing I own right now, and had to listen to the miserable rain for hours on end. Needless to say I have spent most of the day crying. While in this attitude of despair, I decided to call Tyler and ask if we could do something. So, he invited me over and we "watched" princess bride and weezer/stone temple pilots/multiple other music videos. I had such a good time there. I know that in a week he is gone, and that whole week I am at band camp, but while I was with him I forgot all that. I like to sleep so much because while you sleep, you forget. You forget everything that has been happening, you forget why you were angry, you forget the world. Tonight, being with Tyler was like being asleep. I forgot everything but him. He was all that mattered, and as long as I was with him, everything would be fine. Even though I am at my own home now, he is not completely gone. In fact, he will never be completely gone from me. Knowing that is what gives me the strength to keep going.
