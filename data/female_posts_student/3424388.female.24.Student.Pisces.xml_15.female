After updating my unwieldy amazon.com wishlist (btw, is there anything that serves as a better barometer of character?  watch out match.com here comes amazon.com wishlist dating!  i would be in for a serious romantic mishap.), I thought about how handy it would be for everyone to have wishlists.  No more brooding over what to buy friends for birthdays!  I'd just log on to their wishlist.  Viola!    Someone beat me to it.  And that's the case time and time again.  Knowing I'll never have an original idea again is bad enough (the odds are not in my favor -  urlLink 6,442,575,514 people as of 6:33 pm  ), but searching the internet in the hope that perhaps no one has yet put the pen to the paper is usually done in vain.  Inevitably, you discover your unoriginal idea in its full commercialized glory.  The internet serves to remind me, time and time again of my ignorance and gross naivete.  It's not easy claiming residency in cyberland.
