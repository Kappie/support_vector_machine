Yesterday Amber told me Mrs. Groves might not be coming back next year, she was on the RIFF list..whatever that is.  Some stupid District thing.  Anyways, that practically ruined my day.  Theatre is my highschool life, sometimes it helps get me through my day, if I didn't have it next year I don't know what I'd do, plus I'd miss Mrs. Groves herself...anyways,there was a lot of crying and such, but today she got a letter saying she can come back next year! :D woo.  It made my day.  I'm going to the book festival breakfast thing on saturday with Amber.  That should be fun.  Charlie Brown is coming along good, I'm having a lot of fun :)  I really don't have anything important to say.  I'm procrastinating, which is probably a bad idea considering I have a study session later tonight.  My cat is lying on my shoulders, she's still awesome.  I have an ap chem test tomorrow.  Shitty. Anyways, I'm going to stop with my boring...talk...and leave.
