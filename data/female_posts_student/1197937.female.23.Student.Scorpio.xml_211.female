Tomorrow, May 3rd, is a day of celebration that marks the birth of someone who is very special to me. he's not only smart, handsome, and loyal, but has also changed my life in more ways than one. ladies and gents, tomorrow, May 3rd, is the birthday of my beloved firstborn dog/reticent philosopher/king of the backyard, Theodore (Teddy) Ch-Zhang.   oh yeah. and it's benchu's birthday too.   hehehe...  well well well, what can i say about my good friend benchu that won't get me in a crapload of trouble...i'm sure he expects something nice (easier said than done).    hm......        hmmmmmm...........................            hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......................................                 hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................................................                          hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......................................................     oh okay, i know...hehe...  benchu has a very lovely girlfriend. they've been going out ever since dinosaurs roamed the earth. this shows that benchu is very loyal and possibly,  possibly  even loving, but that's not my point.   i remember this one picture that benchu took with his girlfriend. the rest of us saw it and noticed a striking resemblance between the two (nothing personal christine). we couldn't figure out whether they looked alike to begin with, or whether this was the terrible fate that would befall anyone who spends a lotta face-to-face time with benchu. as you can imagine, all of us were terribly disturbed by the possibility of the latter, and i for one, was not willing to take my chances.  this is why i don't see much of benchu anymore. but even so, i still consider benchu to be one of my truest friends, someone i know i can always rely on and whose input i respect a heck of a lot. that is, when he's not too busy abusing me. okay. the end.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY "UGLY"! :)   p.s. i think i did a pretty good job of writing a fair and positive tribute, but just to be safe, i'm fleeing the westcoast for the next three days. if y'all don't hear from me by the weekend, you'll know who was responsible....
