I wanted to kill her. Then she starts telling me how she doesn't really like him. There's 'something about him' that gives her a 'weird feeling' or something like that... She thinks he's too obcessed, especially with the ring and all. She was kinda pissing me off with all the shit she was saying... I mean, I know she's only doing it because she doesn't want to see me get hurt, but still. Does anyone else feel that way? Do you all think Ken is... weird/creepy/whatever? I'm not going to hate you if you tell me that you do, I'd rather you all be honest with me. It won't change my opinion of him, b/c I know how I feel, I'm just curious as to how my friends feel about him...  But anyway... he left for Pennsylvania tonight, and I didn't get a chance to see him. Part of me didn't want to, just b/c of all the stuff that's happened the last few times I've been around him, but now that he's gone I want more than anything to see him, at least to say hi. And now I won't see him until I get back from Fla. on the 8th... 2 weeks from now... I've never gone more than a few days w/o seeing him, and the last time I saw him was Thurs. morning before he left for work. Blah. I feel terrible though, b/c I have been horribly rude/bitter/cold to him since we broke up. I'm using it as my defense mechanism so I don't cry when I can't see him, but it's not fair to him at all. My mind is still set on "You're my boyfriend we need to see each other right now" instead of the "You're my friend hey when can we hang out next?" that it should be on... I don't start crying if I can't see/talk toBethy or Pookie every day, so why can't I get it in my head not to cry when I can't see Ken? This is so unfair... I can't handle this...   WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME????  My mom keeps bringing Ken up all the time too... I can't stand to have them ask me questions all the time. "Are you and Ken back together yet?" "How are you and Ken?" "So are you guys just friends now?" Seriously, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!!!! They can just mind their own business and let me tell them what I want to tell them, which is pretty much nothing. I talk to my friends about stuff, and that's pretty much it. Mostly Pookie, when it comes to Ken stuff. She's the only one that I showed the letters too, and they only one I really feel comfortable talking to about relationship stuff. Bethy just has no experience w/ relationships so it's hard for her to relate and understand stuff, Mande compares stuff to her and Fred all the time, Crazy Katie is too... light-hearted? about everything, and Sam... I just haven't talked to much lately. Idk... It's just easier to talk to one person anyway, b/c then I don't have to tell the stories over and over again, which drives me absolutely insane...   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
