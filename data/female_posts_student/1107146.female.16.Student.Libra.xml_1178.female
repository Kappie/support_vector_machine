Josh, well, I don't think I want him to die.  He was my best comforter today.  All that satire and irony really helps when I'm in a bad mood apparently.  I don't know, though.  Liz was really good about it too.  She gave me a hug when I really needed it.  Thanks, yall.  I know I was being a real witch today.  Maybe tomorrow will be better.  Depends on how things go tonight I guess.  I'll keep yall posted.
