Her parents graduated from PSU, so they had a BBQ. We got to meet some of Amanda's family. It was actually really fun. We met her aunt and uncle, and they are really nice and funny. We plan on going to their house up in Washington sometime this summer. They invited us, and it sounds really fun. We'll get that planned later. Between Amanda's house, and the movie, my day was pretty much filled. It was a good day overall. Actually so far (knock on wood) this summer vacation (all 5 days of it) has been pretty good. Hopefully the rest will be good, if not better!
