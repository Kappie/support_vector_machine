But, I did finish Into The Wild at about 2am, and it's amazing.  Read it, really.    I also found my monolouge....I think.  We'll see.  I'll test it out on my group if they'll listen.  My group...oh man I am excitied.    That's all for now.  More later maybe.  Probably once I get home tomorrow I'll have something worthwhile to rant about.  3 hours in the car with my brother and mother usually do that to me.  Over and Out
