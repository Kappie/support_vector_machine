But I musnt forget its a dress, ughhhh, I dont do dresses.  I really wish that people would not buy me smarties, one pack is fine but 4, im talking tubes here, is a bit excessive.  Hummm........ jess jenny Anna and I put all the fotos for the year buk that we had onto a cd today, great fun!!!  Then we had a little disco in Jess' room, twas fun!!  Ummm i had another message but have forgotten it.... nope I haven't actually.  katie i would not add more hours onto the Bill, because I no longer watch it.  I don't know what I would do, actually yes i do I would save up all the time and stick it onto the weekend, so that i diddnt have to go to school for longer.  Or I would give myself more time asleep because I'm nearly always tired!!! xx
