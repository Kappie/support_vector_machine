The DV tour will consist of the five of us  Vicky, Dave, Bri-y, Rob, (that's me folks), and Penmo.  We will go round various small music festivals and fields, in a VW campervan with lots of beer and other alcohol, being Hippies, and generally having a good time. Atm it rather dpends on me learning to drive and on something else which I can tell you but cannot write on here. Anyway, it should be a gd laugh. Start saving now, and learning to drive and other such things. We are about to venture onto the interweb to find some festivals which we can patronise. More details will follow... Money is important. Get a job if you are me, Dave, Bri, or Penmo, and get another one if you are Vicky.  PS, Carly, we have one more space for a woman on this tour. would you be interested..?
