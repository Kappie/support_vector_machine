The personality of the character in the movie and the place that the movie took place are really similar. In the book Marlow is the main character who tells the story and in the movie, the guy plays the same role as the Marlow do in the movie. And the way the guythinks in the movie and the way Malow thinks are kind of similar. The description of the book about the place was kind o f similar to the place that the movie took.
