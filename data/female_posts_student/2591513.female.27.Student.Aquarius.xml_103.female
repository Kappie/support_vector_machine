Thank goodness I didn't come across the Junior and Senior year ones because then I think I may have just lost it...those were the ones I hold dear to my heart and those are the ones that made me feel closer to my friends.  So I am glad that I am not finding those yearbooks.  I realize that even though I didn't believe I had a lot of friends, I did.  I guess I didn't think of them too often because they weren't in the circle of friends that most my memories were with.  It is interesting though.  Not a lot of them were close friends, but friends nonethless.  I have noticed that my friends (not including the ones I gained as friends through my sisters) live at least 7 hours away.  My very close one is clear across the country.  The other ones are in northern Ca.  The ones in northern CA have remained in touch through the years.  We will lose touch and then by some miracle get a hold of each other again and take up where we left off.  I like that.  There is a familiarity and things aren't different with the friendship even though we are different.  Okay so here are some of my favorite memories:  * History Day...we would make it to state finals after all the drama, we came up with some good work.  * Cooking fried rice for Keiko and having too much garlic...she still ate it and said it was okay...now that's friendship.  * My parents went to IL for a week and my mom forgot to leave money adn we ran out of food.  LOL  I had to pay in quarters and nickels and dimes.  (Had to get into that sparkletts bottle)  * Driving to summer school in my dad's truck, the seats would burn our butts.  * SWIMMING LESSONS were awful because my instructors happened to be the swimmers for the high school, which I happened to manage.  * Walking in school during zero period thinking I was all cute because I had on my emerald babydoll dress only to find out later that I had walk about 20 minutes with my dress up past my ass.  * My first kiss...GROSS!  You know how everyone has the story about the guy just sticking their tongue down your throat...yeah, I have one of those.  * Junior prom...being so infatuated with my date who was so infatuated with my best friend...OUCH!  * Junior prom...first time getting really dolled out...I hated my hair!  * Junior Prom...BOWLING!  Can we say HELLA TROUBLE from my parents?!  * Senior Year (Winter homecoming) Falling in love all over again with Ed.  * Senior Ball...Being in love...  * Senior Ball...15 people in one suite...what the hell were we thinking?  * Grad Nite...beating the damn Marvel Comics game with Keiko.  High school...almost 10 years ago.  THere were some good times...I don't think we will have a ten year reunion, but it sure has been nice looking back.  I will post more if I remember more memories.
