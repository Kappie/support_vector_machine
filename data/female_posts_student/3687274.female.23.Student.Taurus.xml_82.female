Today marks week three of my car being in the shop.  Isn't that funny?  I didn't think so either.  I can't even remember what the problem was on friday, but on monday it was that they dropped the starter and had to replace it but it wasn't going to be dropped off until tuesday.  Tuesday, they had put the starter on, and of course replaced the engine, but the car was still running rough.  Hmmmmmmmmmm.  I took the car in because it was running rough.  They said if I got the whole fucking engine replaced, it would stop.   It didn't stop.  What would your first thought be?  Kevin, oh sweet kevin.  Well he told me that the car wasn't making any noise anymore so the problem was the engine.  Well, now they don't know why it's running rough, but they are keeping it to find out why.  And I should have it today if all goes well.  I think that's there motto.  If all goes well.  Bastards.
