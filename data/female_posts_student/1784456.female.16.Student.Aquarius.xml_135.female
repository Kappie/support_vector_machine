I've been off school like all week apart from Wednesday! Woohoo! (I wondered why no one's coming near me!) I'm quite sad actually ...I saw the end to Final Fantasy VIII. Boohooo! Well ok, I'll break the news slowly. It looks like Squall's dead but then all this woosh stuff happens and then further on Selphie points at Riona and she points up and it cuts out! So you don't know if Squall's actually dead! It's like in FFVII when Aeris dies. :( Hey, what can I say, I cry at movies. Phone again. :( The phone keeps going all the time! Stop phoning! It's my mum and dad. Kind of on the lines of: Are you dead yet? Hey Izzy you are on a different planet! Mr Thackray is pooey, we should make a pooey list! Wow how original! If you live in a dream then you waste a life. (But hey, who believes that?)
