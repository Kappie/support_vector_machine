While my MP3 is playing MY SONGS...my niece knocked on my door...telling me breakfast is served...What life!   Went down for breakfast and plugged on the Bad Boys Soundtrack on CD signaling the start of my new day.   Later this afternoon we'll be going to SMCC (St. Michael College of Caraga), my Alma Mater coz my nephew will have a contest. Hmmm...and probably grab some ice cream as a reward whether he wins or not.   Chin, i'm sorry about your cellphone, but just e-mail me when you have time, it's been a while. And yes...i received your e-card...it was really great...kinda reminded me of Lord of The Rings though.  Currently playing...Counter Strike...he he he he.  And listening to "Kahit Isang Saglit..."
