I had to go wandering by myself again. There are so many tests that I have to put my mind on. There was no time to relax or to think anything else. I don't know why but I seemed to be be avoiding them every single day whenever I can. Or they were avoiding me. Either one. I don't feel too happy about it either. It's never joy to not have any company at all. It's utterly pain and depression. Leave you one year by yourself all alone and the next year, you will go mad.        Loneliness.        I've seen this word countless of times. It is something which many people fear, which I fear, loneliness. I've sighted this somewhere in a place where it doesn't even fit at all. In someone's blog... Yet I know her. She doesn't know what's called lonely, what's called a loner. It was misery. It was beyond hell. She can never know and appreciate what's called occupied.          There are so many friends you can have but not one of them can accompany you when you need them. That's called lonely...
