The more we listened, the more we realized that, generally speaking, the women who were more likely to want closeness were those who felt, to a smaller or larger degree, that they did not get the attention they needed from their fathers....While our observations were not scientific, we have noticed that many of the women we interviewed who had never married were those who described one or both of their parents are 'intrusive' or 'controlling.'" (try smothered...but in a good way.)  "Most women admit that they've dated 'bad boys' and 'good guys,' and both have their appeal and their own set of problems. Some women we talked to help us identify the types and the sets problems you might expect from either type. Ursula said that bad boys are different from grown-up men, that they are 'more attentive but prefer form over substance.' The bad boys were attentive to being romantic and doing sweet things, so there was never any complaint about the 'trimmings.' Whether they were good people or whether I trusted them was the question. A bad boy is the one you want to pick up at the bar. High on charism, low on commitment." (oh so true...but oh so irresistible...)   "Yes, it's true. Women are perverse. We like trouble...someone who doesn't need us is a lot less scary than someone who needs us too much." (amen.)  "Some couples fall apart when the Switch occurs. The Switch is a phase described by Dr. Sills. she writes, "The most common victim of The Switch is the woman. She was being actively pursued when, suddenly, he turns off just when she turns on...Today, however, sex roles in courtship are much more flexible. It is therefore increasingly likely that she may pursue him until she captures his interest and then --- whammo --- she pulls a Switch and he is the victim." (hahaha..."whammo!" well, at least now i have a name for it...)  "Perhaps we all dream of catchng the eye of a gorgeous man across the room and, as violins play in the background, watching him move toward us as our heart says 'this is the one.' (um no...what decade are we in??) In talking to women, we found that some of the most successful marriages began, not with love at first sight, but with a resounding "yuck!"....As the previous stories show, we frequently have a negative reaction to men who end up making a good match for us. The important factor is that we had a reaction, and someone caught our attention." (okay, personally, i'm not a believer of this whole fungus theory either, but it's been known to happen i guess...)  okay, i'm going back to bed. my head is out to explode, probably because of this junk that i've been filling it with. just thought i'd spread it around. please answer my question about the game consoles. thanks y'all.
