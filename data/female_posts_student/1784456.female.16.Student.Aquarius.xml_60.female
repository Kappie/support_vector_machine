It also means going round to lauras and playing pictionary (just when you thought we couldn't get any sadder) and finding out who killed mr.boddy! Speaking of idiot laura - where's she gone? It's all you fault kes - you scared her off with all your moral ramblings!   So anyway - HI ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SEEING THIS AND THINKING THAT KES IS THE ONLY PERSON ON IT - IT'S ME TOO! SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A CRAZY LIFE - LOOK AT MY LIFE, I'M FRIENDS WITH HER!
