Of course, as you well know, i had to go meet my father at his office so we could go to this office christmas party of his.  Also, as I'm sure you know, thats not what happened.....at all. Once on the train downtown, I realized that I had forgotten a few papers that my Dad had wanted me to bring him in my locker at school (of course) so I got off the train at 50th street and my walk back to school.  Silly me for thinking that was the end of that.  Entertainingly enough I made it into school easily enough, i dont think the guards noticed me, but thats ok.  I got my things, and left (once again) and set out to the train.  As I was walking down wondering in what way my father would murder me for being late, I got a call from him.  (oh joy of joys, just who I wanted to speak to)  I was then informed that he had an emergency meeting at the office and that he would meet me somewhere on 34th street, and that we could figure out where later.  So I plodded down to 34th street and wandered about in the dark, cold, loneliness that it was.   Granted this is when things began to look up.  As walked into the Manhattan Mall and saw Sharifah and Lauren(yay) we hung out for a bit untill my father called me and said "ok im on 34th, where are you?"  The three of us said our goodbyes and I went off to find my father and go to this party that i was sure would be...fun.  We arrived at this party and thusly began my several hours of standing alone in a corner in an ackward silence because who did I know at that party?? Come on...guess...thats right...nobody!  YaY!  I admit, there was some conversation, though it all happened to be about what i was doing with my self for college?/whats in canada?/oh my how you've grown.  The iceing on the cake came when both my parents, seperately mind you, told me to "loosen up"  yeah...a blast.  The only true reprive I got was the short few seconds i got to take a call outside from Summer, but that was rather short lived, ah well, a breaks a break. We got back home at one in the morning and five hours later i was awake again to take the cursed SATII's...wahoo.  an ordeal in itself, but i won't bother you with that.  So thats where i am now, returned and griping about my life, something that I'm sure none of you want to hear.....well to bad.  Thats that i suppose, not much else, i'll talk to you all later, and see you on tuesday. Have a good weekend, or at least one thats better than mine is turning out to be.  LATERZ!
