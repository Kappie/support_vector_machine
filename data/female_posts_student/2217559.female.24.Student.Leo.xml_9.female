It was soo incredible - he told me all about the story of pete. I will get the artist information for the site but his work goes for over 18K per painting. We are working a trade deal where i solicit my VIPs and vice versa. It was fun.  Tonight was my first night in the "Staff Bar" and it should have been labeled the gay bar because everyone in there was gay - male though.  I met an incredible waiter from south africa who was just beautiful. His name ios Julias and his girlfriend is aboard. He is way cool even though he has a MAJOR uni-brow. I6t was fun though-  I had a few glasses of wine, and then went downstairs with the gays. Hehehehe. My ship is weird - I am learning that the "cruise life" is much different from any other. Everyone I meet is either leaving in a week or here until January.  I miss my family and when I say family I mean friends and blood. I mean hello, it's 2:30AM and I am at my computer writing. I miss my Jennifer so much. There are no women on board that I am interested in. None. And the men - well, they are greeek or british and all are mostly gay. I will have a hangover tomorrow for sure, so i may not write. Blah blah blha. I am going to run outside smoke a smoke and then go to sleep. No cabin sickness yet but hell if I drink any more tonight there will be sickness in general.  Oh remind me to tell y0ou about Jason the singer. He's fucking awesome.   Okay, sign off for now, Paddy. Love you guys and miss you terribly.  Please don't forget about me.   Your shipboard social hostess,  Shelly
