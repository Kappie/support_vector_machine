I am sitting here eating coacoa pebbles on this hot summer day, 88 degrees (thank you weatherbug) and writing in this because I am extremely bored. Today I am an only child, because my sister AND brother are both at my cousins house, it feels good to be an only child. The only other person at the house today is my mom, and Ozzy. Ozzy is my little brother, he is a 2-year-old Jack Russell mix, and he loves toys, like his thing head, taxi, reno dolls, and duck. He is short, has brown, white, and black hair, a docked tail, sticky-uppy ears, and a yellow collar and DAMN is he cute. Other words, I am waiting for a call from my best friend, Olivia, about going to see a movie, but she hasn't called. I am really lazy, so I won't call either. I bet she is just like me, and is being a lazy bum. Oh well. The music I'm listening to right now is  Boogie Nights  ,  by Earth, Wind, and Fire. It's an old song from the 70's, but it's really good.  Dance with the boogie get down, cause boogie nights are allllwaaays the best in town!    It has nothing to do with my mood right now, but it still makes me wanna get up and boogie. I'm reading this book, called "Lucy's Launderette". It sucks horribly, but I'm still going to read it, because I've given up on about 6 books this summer, so I feel stupid. Anyway, I think I'm going to go now and call Olivia. Someone has to call! Shee Yah Lata.      -Sierra
