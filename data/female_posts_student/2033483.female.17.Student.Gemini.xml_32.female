We are going to start today's entry with a moment of silence for Hot Boy's hair. *sush, silence*  Why did he cut it?  I don't know.  He can no longer be called Hot Boy.  You were so right, Renae.    I'm not going to bother going period by period through my day because it wasn't that interesting at all.  Everyone had issues today.  Jessica had her car "bump," Megan had her driving test, and Lizzie had her enemy at school.  I had no major issue which doesn't bother me a bit.    For the first time this winter season, I had to wear my winter coat to school.  It was very interesting when it came to choose a parking space cuz I couldn't see the lines.  Then after school, coming outside to find ice on the car and having to scrape it off (which was a lot of work for such a small girl I may add) was a big surprise.  Ick to winter!  I hate winter!  Goodnight all!
