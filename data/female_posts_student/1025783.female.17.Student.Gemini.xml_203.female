I got a lot more tanner, muscular, and grew up more than I ever though was humanly possible. I guess being in charge of 30 2nd and 3rd grade girls and knowing that they depend on you to sustain life is a sobering fact. I've made mistakes in life, hell I've been irresponsible and selfish and covered myself in lies and misleadings to make myself look better. But when you're carrying a little girl over a mile to the health center because your walkie talkie breaks and you're up a mountain and she's got a fever and is throwing up and shaking and feeling dizzy....then my friend, you grow up and you realize just how minimal and unimportant you, just YOU are. These little girls are the reason I came to camp. The reason I spend my senoir summer in the blaring heat stuck isolated in mountains with 80 other staff all in college cleaning and singing and hiking our brains out. This summer, I've learned to stick up for what I believe in, to look at the big picture, and hell- most of all, to care...
