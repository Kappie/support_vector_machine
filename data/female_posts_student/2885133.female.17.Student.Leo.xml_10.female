It's so strange to worry about an exam for art history when my friends are vacationing in Macchu Piccu or at a summer camp or merely lounging at home with a good book. My perception of what a person should do during summer vacation definitely matured or mutated to something like work in the summer, work in the school year, and work some more. I love the notion of work hard and play hard, but I need to find time to play hard. Guess that's what I'll be doing during the weekend. Somehow play, read for art history and biology, clean the house, and followups for my experiments all at the same 24-hour block.  I'm hopeless at this point.
