Curt was here this weekend... so naturally he and humaira (his girlfriend) were on the phone constantly. And when they werent curt was talking about how much he missed her... and yea they've been going on for a LOT longer... and she livesin NYC... andthey're older and what not... but i mean still... he gets to talk to her at least... all the time on top of that... I just wish that there was something that i could do to be able to talk to eric at least... i would be fine with not getting to see him... i just miss talking to him... u know... being part of his life... its really starting to get to me... and it really sucks... Today when i was at the mall i saw Jason Harsy and we were talking about eric becuz jason works with him. And i told him the whole situation and he told me to keep holding on and all that good stuff... and i plan on it... its just so hard. I mean its worth it becuz i love him... and he means the world to me... but its just so hard.. I have this picture of us sitting right next to my computer and im always looking at it and i just want to start crying... becuz i miss him so much and there isnt anything that i can do about it. Mom and i were talking about it today on the way home today... and i was talking about eric and his parents and the whole situation... and we were trying to better understand it... and u know see if maybe we both talked about it we could figure something out... but we still couldnt come up with anything.. I just dont understand how someone's parents would want to take something away from their kids if it made them happy... i mean if it's something bad then yea, thas understandable... drugs... alcohol... all the bad no-no's... i can understand that. But im a good kid... i dont do any of that... its just not fair... I dunno... it's just been tougher than normal lately. It's like the only music i really listen to is anything that he sent me... Ugh... i just cant wait for school to start... so i can see him again... I really didnt think this was going to be this hard... but it is... I always find myself driving like 10 miles out of the way to get home just to drive by his house... even tho i know that i cant stop and go in and say hi... just so... i dunno... maybe i'll see him standing outside and i dunno... something... I guess even if i just get to see him as im passing by... ill take that... It's like i try to go into town at a time that he might be getting off work, or going into work... or something... its so sad just how much i miss him... it's pretty pathetic actually... but i dunno... its like all that ive been thinking about lately... Oh well... its not like there is anything that i can do to change any of it... I just have to do what Jason told me to... just keep holding on and pray for the best... so thas what i plan on doing...
