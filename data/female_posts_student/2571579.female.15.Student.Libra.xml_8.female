My hair is now dark.. i kind of wish it wasnt AS dark for the summer but whatever. It's kind of a winter do. I just cut like a half inch off but then i decided to ask for it to be angled in the front since I did it twice myself and it came out bad but that's just what happens when i get bored. I dont like it tho because it curls in by my chin and it pisses me off =\ grrr! Whatever tho .. there's nothing i can do so ill just wait till it grows longer. I'll probally straighten it in the front now so it's not as bad. But tonight I met eileen, mandie (ackoury), and kayleen i think. haha wow it's sad that i forget her name already. But we were just walkin around and Matt saw us and picked us up. Mandie pissed me off tho because she barely knows matt and she was telling him to go drive them here and all this shit and they wanted to get eggs and she was just being an asshole. Her friend was cool tho.. except when she was playing chicken .. that was stupid. I dont even care tho. Before matt dropped me off he asked about Al.. i donno what his problem is. It's not a big deal if I like people or not...or it shouldnt be. Cause the person i've been trying to forget about for like .. years on and off.. doesnt IM me anymore. So i'm trying to be mad and say it isnt worth caring. It's only working a little bit but that's alrite. I'll get there.
