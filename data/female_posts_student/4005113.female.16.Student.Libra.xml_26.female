I hope you all had (are having?....how do I put that?) fun on the retreat. I'm really sad that I couldn't go. But I'm excited, I haven't been to Las Cruces since last summer, and I want to see my family that lives there. So, I won't be at the concert on Wed, either. Hope you all have fun. Somebody tell me about it sometime, or email me or something. I'll be back next Sunday for church, though, so I'll see some of you then. If anybody wants to, you can email me while I'm gone. I should have access to a computer. I'm pretty sure my grandparents still have internet....email me at  urlLink panther_power2006@yahoo.com  if you do email me. It'd be fun to get emails while I'm gone, and then I can tell you how vacation's going, too! I'm going to be gone from my granparens' during part of the week, but if I can, I will email you back sometime before I come home. Well, I better get off the internet now. I've been on for a long time. TTYL!! Love you all!
