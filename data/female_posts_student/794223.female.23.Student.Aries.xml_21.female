It's very difficult to make A's in that class...not to mention that he used one of my essays as an example!  It was the supreme self-esteem booster of the month.  Sorry, I know no one else really cares.  But it was definitely what I needed to hear after a very difficult beginning to the semester.  On a couple of random notes: I will be SO glad when this damn re-call thing is over in California, so that we can finally talk about SOMETHING ELSE.  I really hope that they won't have a governor Arnold.  Eww.    Secondly: a tiger has no place in either an apartment as somebody's pet, a zoo, or a 3-ringed circus for that matter.  If you're concerned about species endangerment, they have habitats that are specialized to mimic as closely as possible their natural habitats, without hundreds of clapping spectators or an obvious idiot who thinks that having a wild beast for a pet half the size of his apartment is a grand idea.  Oh humanity.  It's nappy time.
