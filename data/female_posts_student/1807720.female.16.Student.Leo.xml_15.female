I am feeling really confident about the quiz tommorow because I was thinking about what my math teacher said that if I had confidence I would be much better at things and right now I feel like I really believe in myself and that I can do anything.     Believing  Yes, Joyful it seems Understanding Makes so much sense I believe  And remember and Listened to the words Gave me advice Told me to be confident  With confidence ANYTHING is possible, achievable Reachable goals attainable  I believe With errors, comes success Disbelief, AND belief Sadness, AND Happiness  All makes so much sense Know I can make it through Have been searching for Found the light  knowing Thinking Wondering BELIEVING  In my heart I know What path I must follow CURVES along the way but we all get there  One way or another All works out, Gods plan Never know what comes next Just keep believing  and I know now Would not give up chem for anything these dreams, goals, aspirations mean something so special  So important, ALWAYS I know where my heart lies Realize what makes me heart beat and I believe that I can do anything  ~Vanessa
