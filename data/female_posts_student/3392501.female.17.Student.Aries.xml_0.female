I did something really wicked last night. She deserves it tho. My mortal enemy. That bitch who has nothing else to do than to cut me down when we haven't seen each other in two years. She so two-faced. She's always copied me since middle school too. It's so childish of her. Anyway, I have an OD and she does to. She's been posting all this nameless crap about me acting all "I'm so awesome" shit. I set my diary to favorites could read only. A few days later she does the same thing. WTF? What a loser! ANywho, I hack in and find out her password. It was a really easy guess anyway. Lol. I consol my sempai and he teaches me how to handle this situation.  I deleted all of her entries, after I downloaded her whole diary to my hardrive. And left only one entry for her and her little friends (who can't decide for themselves who to be friends with) to read. "What goes around comes around, bitch" In the largest font they allowed and in yellow so it'll stand out the most. Then I got a fake e-mail and e-mailed her diary to her. That's how I deal justice. She doesn't have the internet at home so it'll take her a long time maybe to sign on.  I kno it's childish but it her fault for being this way. She just needed a taste of her own medicine. She just needs to get over herself and over her ideas. She's in quite a pickle I'll say. >)
