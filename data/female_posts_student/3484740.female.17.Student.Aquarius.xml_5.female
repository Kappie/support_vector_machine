What else is there? I can't just sit here and wait around for nothing, which is exactly what I am doing. He can't "stop for me," just for other people, well that isn't going to work for me. Which is exactly what he does and how he talks, I'm not sure what the whole message thing was about, how there was only one nice message, perhaps that was directed at me, but I don't remember any messages that weren't nice. I got upset because he told me one thing and changed it at the last minute. I wouldn't have sat up for as long as I did had I known things were going to change, again. So I guess thats all I can say, whatever happens happens. Its all up to him now. I'm tired of it, and I quit. I have more important things to do and more important people to deal with if thats how hes going to be. I'm sure he had a few minutes today to say something to me. But thats okay too. Whatever he wants.
