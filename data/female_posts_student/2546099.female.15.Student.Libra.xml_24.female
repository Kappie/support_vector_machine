I know even now after it has been ages since he has been in my life, i am still affected by the past. I need closure from the whole situation but he wants to be friends and all i want is closure and then for him to go away. It may sound mean but thats wat i feel i want. Comments or advice would be really helpful right now because i am so confused about the whole situation. Atm only Kate knows how it is all affecting me but im gonna say it now, because i dont care who reads it. I havent had a bf since Jim which was like 12 months ago. Sure ive had opportunities, but at first iwas like nah i wanna stay single, but really that was just hiding the truth. Then it was i dont like them in that way. But now the reason is that i want to make sure that i really like them because i dont want what happened with josh to happen again. It may sound stupid but past experiences affect people differently and this is how this particular experience has affected me.  He wants me to yell and scream at him but what is the point?  Lisa xx  P.S maybe another day ill post the convo on here.
