"hi miss. do you believe in god?" "um...yaaa...why?" "would you have a minute by the way?" "a min??? yep i do." "do you know who is jesus?" "ya...he's the man who died on the cross" "WOW! thats a good start.." [start to what? i think] "would you like to invite him into your life and make him your best friend?" "um...like..." "its really easy!!" "oh well..go ahead.." "repeat after me then..." *they held my hand and began to say this super long prayer...i swear it was like 5 mins long...* "amen" "Amen" [i said that..after so long...] aaaand the conversation continues....one minute became 5...then 10...then 15...you get the idea.... they made a prayer for my exam...and then i was finally released...dont get me wrong. i do go to church and all...i do pray to jesus....this time though, jesus caught me in the wrong place at the wrong time...after my "liberation" i went to the 4th floor only to find the siemens center closed...the sony phone relocated to inside isetan...and the siemens center wasnt there!!!! god!!! i wasted my time travelling and walking in the rain!!! fine..i was still cool then...then i took 190 @ the busstop behind ngee ann city...and this woman poked me in a sensitive place with the back of her umbrella...ouch! how can i possibly tahan a blow to my ahem...assets..in the middle of the road??? damn...it was painful. it subsided after what seemed like eternity..[somewhere in the middle of the expressway] went bek to college...lend a hand in painting the banner...this bitch was there making a hella noise...i still tahan..and refused to believe i was havin a bad day. after those toots went off...i begun the work on the middle part of the 7m banner...the paint hadnt dried...and i actually sat on it!!!! there was this BIG fluorescent yellow, letter D on the back of my skirt.  GREATTTT!! how am i supposed to go home? the rest were just laughing...so sad...lucky i had pe...wore my pe shorts and shirt... used an old cloth to wipe paint off..getting the paint off with turpentine was the easy part...getting the smell out is another story...pple literally moved away from me in the bus...i guess i stank along with the skirt....paint on my face..neck...arms...must have looked like a sri lankan maid. came home late...had A math...and then...wash wash and wash my skirt. it still stinks. i guess i'd have to settle for pants tmrw. i think i did have a bad day...havent recovered from my streak of bad luck.   but one thing or rather one person made me happy.  Sri.  thanks gurl...i do need help with math..suck at it...someday dear...me hope you are doing just fine with your bro overseas... i guess you miss him huh...suppose shakespeare was right when he said absence makes the heart grow fonder. i hope its true too.  long long long post. hand pain. i think your eyes pain. cannot type anymore...sleep is lingering at my eyelids...threatening to close em shut... ...think i'm starting to blabber ready...better chao now  bubbye..and nites
