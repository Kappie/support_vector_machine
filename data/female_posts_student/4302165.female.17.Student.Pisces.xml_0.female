The MO is the same; frequent hang ups or obscenities and threats but this time it's obvious that Joe is the target. Furthermore, when Joe isn't at work, the calls don't happen.  The police have gotten involved, and from what Joe tells me, they have leads and/or already know who the caller is. Yesterday, he put up a notice on the board at work, informing everyone that the police are involved and that it better stop, or charges will be pressed. This, of course, leads me to believe that the person doing it either a) works with us or b) is a former employee, but at the advice of the police, Joe won't say who it is. He did, however, give what I think is a big hint. Walking into the room, he looked right at me, shrugged his shoulders and said, "What's good?! You're going to jail!"  The only person I have ever known to use the phrase 'what's good' was a former employee by the name of Frank. And Frank, being the idiot that he is, would be stupid enough to do something like this. When I asked Joe if that was supposed to be some kind of hint as to the identity of his pranker, he just shook his head very innocently. I have no other proof that it is Frank that's doing it, but I wouldn't put it past him.  Joe has the phone number of the guy who was calling us the first week it happened, but when he called it yesterday to have me listen to the voicemail message, the guy who picked said that he "found the phone." Later his story changed to having bought the phone on the street and that he was trying to sell it back to it's owner. Joe offered him $100 for it if he would come down to the restaurant, in broad daylight and with myself and Diana as witnesses and give him the phone. The man refused, so Joe offered him as much money as he had in his pocket ($650 which I counted myself) to sell it to him, but the man again refused, saying that if Joe wasn't the owner than he wasn't going to sell it to him. Joe told him that he didn't believe him, but if he would just look down the list of recent outgoing calls and read him off repeat numbers, he would still pay him $100. This, apparently, was 'against his morals' and the man refused. Joe called him on his bluff and told him he believed that it was his phone, and that he would be calling the police, but I left before he could do so.  I don't really want to get involved with this; I'm already involved with way too much other 'business', but I supposed I'll help Joe out if he needs it. After all, if it is Frank that's doing it, I'm more than willing to take the bastard down.  Kachel  PS- Chris Luna is getting brave behind a keyboard. The boy has to learn that if he's going to play with fire, he's going to get burned. I'm not the type of girl to put up with innuendos and conceited flirting when I already made it clear I'm not interested. It's like baiting an angry wolf....
