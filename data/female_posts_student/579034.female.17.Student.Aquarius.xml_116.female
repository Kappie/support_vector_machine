I just watched South Park and wow.. it was HYSTERICAL... it was about Kyle going to see "The Passion" and like when he sees it he just like feels bad about being Jewish and having killed Jesus and Cartman like, starts up a group that's main goal is to kill Jews but the people that join think its a spiritual group and Kyle goes before the Synagog congregation sayin they should appologise for killing Jesus that way. And Stan and Kenny go see the movie and they hate it so they go to see Mel Gibson and ask for their money back and Mel is like a complete lunatic asking if they wanna torture him to take the money and its like only 18 dollars when he lives in this like beyond huge mansion and like they finally get away and he follows them back to South Park and everyone sees what a lunatic he is and... omg it's just so funny.... you all need to start watching it cause this is great stuff... then at the end they said all this stuff about how if you wanna be Catholic thats great but you should follow the teachings of Jesus and not be guilted into going to Church and stuff. It just makes so much sense!... but yeah... so.. just had to tell you how much I love South Park... ah... makes life worth living x0x
