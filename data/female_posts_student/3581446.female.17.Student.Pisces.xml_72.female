Now having established that I am going to expound on the evil of caffeine free beverages as I feel they are quite deceiveing in their presentation.   I will cite one example that happened to me recently, I went to pick up a bottle of pepsi, thinking "hey I will watch anime tonight and binge drink pepsi cola" little did I know that because there was no color difference on the bottles I bought, that I would be scammed out of my anime fuel!  It hit me like a Tornado, 'What treachery is this?!' and alas that night I did not make it through my entire collection, instead I had to settle with only watching Bebop before the consequences of being up for two days straight, took it's toll on my body and then the warm and loving darkness of unconciousness gripped my tortured, nacho laden form, oh well such is life..   - Kman
