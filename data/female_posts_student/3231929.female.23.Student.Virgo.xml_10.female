Then when I got to the thing I was supposed to be in, it was cancelled so there went my morning.  On an entirely different note I had assorted family members on the phone last night. It began with Mum saying about how things went at the solicitors, then Ann rang to say she was 'fine' about not being an executor. After that she decided she was going to find out how much I knew about Dad and his illness. About a week ago I mentioned in front of Ann that I thought he had schizophrenia - she claimed last night she'd known about it from the beginning and had urged Mum to tell Davy and me. Today in the cold light of day I'm wondering whether she was trying to stir something up with her continued "How do you feel about that?" etc. I just think that Mum clearly made the decision years ago not to tellus, for us to discover it for ourselves which I did. It's not as if I can do anything about it, I can't change my genetics!  Maybe on a more alarming note Ann confirmed my suspicions that there was an element of domestic violence, although to be true, Gran had already hinted at this many, many years ago. Just as Gran had already recently told me about Social Services being concerned about our wellbeing.  It is a funny life I lead! My parents separatedwhen I was 1 1/2 and divorced by the time I reached 2. My Mum has never really spoken toeither my brother or I aboutwhat the circumstances were at the time. I was never told he had a serious mental illness - I was to discover it for myself when at 17 I saw him presumably just after a hefty dose of anti-pyschotics and the side effects were so evident that they stuck in my mind. I always grew up thinking he was essentially a bad person but now I have no idea where the schizophrenia starts and where the person ends. Although today I can honestly say that I don't know the man very well anyway. I might see him twice or maybe three times a year; and other than that he shows little interest in whatever I'm doing.  Right, back to phone calls...somehow my brother rang and I told him about Mum's stance and Ann's opinion. He raisedthe very really issue of security,Gran's house isnot being lived in but it's full of expensive stuff. I thentold him about the conversation with Ann about Dad and he raised his concerns about he or I ever developing the condition.I simply re-assured him thatlike me, there is simply nothing we can do about it.  On a more amusing note, Irealised afterwards that my housemates could have heard everything I said on the phone - poor things! How confused they must be about what's goingon....
