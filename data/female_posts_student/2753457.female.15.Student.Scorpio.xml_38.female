Well, I guess I don't need a reason to be a fan of something.  I've lasted this long without reason.  I needn't make sense now. Well, piano was actually pretty good.  I had him help me rehearse my song for Saturday.  He's a really good singer--sometimes I forget about his theatre background.  So I didn't have to play the sonata today (and good thing too). I going to go clean myself up.  I feel soiled from the day.
