I have to say, that I must have the patience of the Buddha, because I actually spoke to her.  The hardest thing about being around her is...um...well, I guess the hardest part about being around her is   being around her.  It is so uncomfortable to be in the same room with her.  The weirdest part is I'm her boss.  So I can't just not talk to her.  I have to give her direction.  And naturally, she's a damn bum.  I always have to tell her to get back to work.  Thankfully, she won't be there tomorrow like expected.    "Now if any of you sons of bitches have anything else to say, NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!!!" O-ren Ishii, Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  There was still one can of worms left open.  I had to address the nosy-busybodies at the skate center.  Naturally, I was appreciative of the fact those people cared enough about my feelings to tell me what was going on.  However, I do not want it to be the subject of their dinner table discussions.  So, I gathered the group together tonight while I was there.  I told them thanks, but its over, stop talking about it.  I asked if anyone if there was anything they wanted to know, if they had any questions, and no one did.    So, I believe its over.  Joel and I are good, she knows I'm pissed, everyone had instructed to get out my biznass.  Maybe my next post will be about something fun.  Maybe.  But, for now, I have to go wake my dear boyfriend up off the couch, and get him to come to bed.  Quite the chore.  Nite, all.
