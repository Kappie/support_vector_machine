Sure, I can debate the hell out of a "more money for medicare" bill, but that's just because I already talk so much that it's what I do best.  I wish I could be like Martha Stewart.  Ok, nix that actually becuase I kind of like my house, and I don't like showering with other people in big cement rooms, so jail isn't really my thing, but I wish I could do what she does.  I'm not exactley sure what the problem is either, because I can have the vision, and I know exactley what I want it to look like, I just...can't get it to.  I'm also not very good at mind games.  Crap, nix that too.  Ok, what I mean is not good at LOGIC games, (I'm very good at mind games, that's how I win in debate).  I can argue until I turn blue, and find a loop-hole in any bill, but I can't win at tic-tac-toe...I'm not exactley sure where this posting is going...I guess I'm just throwing out the random thought that I wish I could be more creative.  Oh well, whatever, I can write, sometimes, I wonder if Miss Martha can do that...
