Actually, it was a pretty normal day until I got home and got online.  Amy is going to job shadow for  urlLink DC101 's  urlLink Elliot (as in Elliot in the Morning). How freaking awesome is that!?   The other thing that made my day was... well, I'm not going to say until later... :)  ...However, if you are a person who I often talk to in real life, feel free to ask me what it is... :-D  As for yesterday.. It was a crazy day... Crazy, crazy day.  It's a bit long and I'm feeling a bit to giddy to type, much less stay on one subject for a length of time. I'll just say it involved evactuating the school (after school hours), my going to the hospital, and hopes (of the much of student body) being squashed.     Tabitha-"..You're like Jesus's sidekick or something." Jordan - "Ashley is the conscience of the entire student body."  ...Hahaha... right.....
