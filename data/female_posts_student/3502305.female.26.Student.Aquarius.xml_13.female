The colors looked different, everything looked different.  I thought I'd sleep in this morning, but couldnt.  I got up at around 8a today, and started checking email and catching up on other stuff.    I think the trip was just what I needed to get away from my life, even if just a short time.  Though I didnt get much sleep the whole week, I do have a better attitude and appreciate life more.  (However, I imagined myself hanging on a noose every now and then)  I was hating the trip on the 4 and 5 days.  I was disgusted with the restrooms at the campsites and irritated with some of the ppl.  I conversed with half the group, while the other half had problems with socializing.  So it got really weird at times.    The canyons we visited were all very impressive, esp. the Grand Canyon.  REALLY SPECTACULAR!  We didnt hike down in the canyon, instead we walked around the rim,  I would walk along the edge of the cliff to get the most of the canon view.  I took photos with almost everystep.  I felt like I was on a different planet, like on Mars.  There would be birds flying around the canyon.  I saw a few lizards.    By the six day, everyone, including I, were all happy to be going back home.  But as we approached our destination home, I was feeling kinda sad that it was ending.  I was getting used to the ppl, the camping lifestyle, the views of mountains and talks of formation.  I'd like to do another trip like this again sometime in the future.   For now, I've got alot of catch up to do in this urban environment.
