       
      I've been doing a lot of thinking over these past two weeks... And I decided I am not a blog person.  I don't want to tell people about my day, I want to spend it with them or tell them everything over lunch.  I don't want to babble about what's on my mind, I want someone to show interest first.  So, once again to my two faithful readers, I will write again when I take a really fun picture, or when I have become bored of all my projects, or when I think of something I just have to get out.  But until then, ta ta.  I had a wonderful time at camp and in Chicago.  I have lovely stories.  If you would like to hear them,  Let's do lunch?
