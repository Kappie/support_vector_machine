Haha, I doubt he's waiting in general, but a girl can dream. Hm, In the Shadows by The Rasmus is really sounding good right now and so is Death of Season by AFI. There isn't much you can say about my boring life, except, when is the right man going to step in it. When am I going to get my guitar? When am I going to get enough determination to finish my summer school stuff, oh geeze. Damn homiez, I really want the Vampyre SN or the Buddy Guy Polka Dot Stratocaster. Daymn, When am I going to get up and make something of my life. SOON, I SWEAR. I'm going back on AIM or to listen to some songs. Check out Coheed and Cambria my friend.
