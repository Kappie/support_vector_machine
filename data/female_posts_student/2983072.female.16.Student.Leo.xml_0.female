The most beautiful little girl ever with an attitude to boot. And it angers me to know that she doesn't like herself. The other day she just started crying in my room going on about how she doesn't belong, how she doesn't like herself because she think she's ugly and no one at school likes her. Needless to say i listened but i also set her straight, and talked it over with her.  Hmf, then I'm sitting here, listening to her go on and on knowing that this is the child that has better luck with guys than I do. She's an amazing kid, and did I mention she'll probably get a boy friend before I do (is that not sad?)   But no really, see I'm always wishing I was more like her. More spontaneous, more open, able to express my feelings to those I love with ease. But strange how the things you dislike about your own personality are the envy of others.  No one is ever satisfied with what they have...and that's a very sad reality.    I should go to sleep now but I don't really feel all that tired...I think I'll mope around for a while maybe watch "Underworld" again(which is by the way a really good movie) and drink some soy milk as my tribute to beast boy.   Long live the cute and the fuzzy.
