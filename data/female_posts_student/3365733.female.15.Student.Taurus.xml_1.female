She managed to appease my mum; not like I had extremely bad results  lah , but my mum suspects too much. *Shakes head* And expects too much from me as well... Oh well.  Ranked 2nd in class, though. Lost to Thunder. Hah. His maths got a frickin' 97? My average was only lower than his by 0.3, grr. Not fair!! 2nd in level as well. =) Beat Woonpeng and ZW! =) I'm a happy girl.  Comments worth noting from Ms Leong:  `A very responsible and helpful chairperson, I'm making her the chairperson for the whole of the year; the other classes are changing their hierachy.'  `I'm very impressed by how she is able to concentrate in class despite the chaos around and behind her!'                    (My class is notorious for being very noisy and rude to teachers =))   Teehee. =) Ms Leong is cool.
