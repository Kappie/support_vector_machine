Forever  You are like a beacon to me Your smile, your face, your eyes They call to me They tell of safety, they tell of love Tell me that all I need to do is to get to you To feel whole If I could I would run to you Never leave your side Tell me how to get to you, and I'll come Just tell me when...  Give me half a chance I'll fill you with warmth Just give me the courage I lack I'll stay by you Lead me through the hard times I'll give you all the good All I would ever want in the world Is to be here in your arms- Forever  I see you when I close my eyes It gets me through each day That taunting vision of someone so dear Could it be a sign? I need but to think of you To feel that things will be all right But that emotion isn't good enough I need to hear your voice telling me so before I know it's true I know if I was near you I'd never have to fear Won't you please show me how?  All I need is a word I'd give you all I am Just safeguard my soul for me It will give you the happiness you deserve Tell me it's all right, show me the way I'll make you feel whole day after day You're my breath, my sight, my hope And all I need is you- Forever
