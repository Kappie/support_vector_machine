No, actually, it's really nice to go back and read my later entries, because then I think-- as I did today, at least-- that I have become much more positive over the course of the last month or so.   Anyways, Mom let me drive all of us up to WalMart today, and even over to Walnut Beach, which was a blast by the way. The water was freezing, so I sprawled across the blanket to bask in the sun, and oh do I have a sunburn to show for it. But it doesn't really hurt, so I'm hoping it's temporary.   I went to hang up babysitting signs today, because as of last Sunday, I am no longer employed at Hardees; by my own accord, of couse. I hated it there. So, I'm hoping at least one person will call me, and I'll be able to get some money for this summer.   Tomorrow is our first tennis practice! I am somewhat excited... indeed it is not going to be anything like last year, and yeah, Sarah's in it this year, so it's going to be even more weird, but I'll make the best out of it. I hit with Jen last week, and I wasn't bad considering the fact that I haven't played for about 8 months, so hopefully the Braggas won't be wholly disappointed in their future 2nd SINGLES player... Just can't let Allison pull ahead...
