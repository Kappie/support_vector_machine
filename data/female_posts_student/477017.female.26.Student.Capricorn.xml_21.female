He came 12th in Mad Magazine's annual list of the country's 20 dumbest people. The rapper was nominated for changing his name from Puff Daddy to P Diddy. The list was topped by the Reverend Jerry Falwell, who blamed the September 11 attacks in part on "abortionists, feminists, gays, and lesbians." Mad's co-editor John Ficarra told  urlLink Clickmusic.com : "We thought Falwell had reached his personal pinnacle of dumbness a few years ago when he accused the Teletubbies of promoting homosexuality - we underestimated him."
