I ought to be studying for the GRE, but I really don't want to take it and have put it off thus far.  If I want grad school though, I should start working on it.  I'm worried about that.  Getting in.  And what I will do if I don't. I don't want to get stuck not getting in and then working and forgetting all about school.  I could see that happening fairly easily. Sleepy sleepy me.  I can't believe how tired I am and it's not even lunch time yet.  Tomorrow I get to watch the new orang be introduced at the zoo.  YAAY.  Should be fun, as long as I don't run into any stupid zoo people who make me angry (ie. boys I had crushes on in previous weeks).  But then there's always one of those around somewhere, right?  Im feeling a nap right now... then maybe I can work a little before heading back to work.
