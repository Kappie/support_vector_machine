It really got me thinking about how I do have a negative attitude at times.  I always used to try and keep a positive outlook, but lately…not as much.  I have just given up in a way.  But a thought hit me…I know that God exists, better still, I know he loves me and longs for me.  Not many people accept, care, or place any value in that…so I am very fortunate.  If anything else, I can place this wretched life of mine in his hands, and it isn’t even always ‘wretched’.  I will find joy in him, because if I don’t, that’s kind of a slap in his face.  It would be as if I were saying “You have given me everything when I deserve nothing, but I still hate living.”  Come on Camille, you are not expected to always be busting with laughter, but hold fast to him and give him what he deserves.  My thanks, my love, my honor.
