It is *only* 3:30 am and there is nothing on TV!;)  Basically, the only thing still on is Profiler (and similar shows), Infomercials, and advertisements for sleeping aids!  I don’t like watching ads for sleep aids while I am awake at night.  I realize that they market them at night to catch an intended audience, but people who have trouble sleeping watch TV in the day time too.  Perhaps if I saw the commercials earlier in the day I would have a chance at obtaining the products so that I could sleep at night instead of watching their ad.  However, with their ads airing at night, I have little chance of obtaining the product after seeing the ad.  It feels like teasing to me, like when I see a Pizza commercial after the restaurant has already closed;)  Infomercials are bad enough without additional commentary LOL, so I won’t touch much on this one.  The fact is that it is both boring and disturbing to watch someone cut cans with knives (as though this is a normal activity of knife owners), mop ceilings with extended handled mops, and build muscles on contraptions that look as though they were designed by the military for torture.  The main problem with shows like Profiler, and other intense crime shows is that at 3:30 am, they scare the shit out of me!  I can barely watch these programs at 3:30 in the afternoon without constantly checking behind me!  So these are the choices I am left with…Of course I do have a DVD player and a VCR which I could utilize…but again it is 3:30 am…and I am not thinking clearly;)
