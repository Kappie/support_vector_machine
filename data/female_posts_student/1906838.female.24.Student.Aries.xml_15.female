It is NOT as easy as it looks .. i mean .. sure you get all the info from the baby's notes etc but it just isnt THAT easy ... because the stupid form wants you to explain and justify the info you have just obtained. Its a good thing the African SHO with the unique forename ( 'sayang lebih') was around today and more than willing to go through some of the details with me. Its good that he was around too cos he went through the dubowitz scoring chart with me and the rest. But i still need to finish the green form ..   I think im not in the best of my moods today .. main reason being : i still havent finished the all exasperating green form. Plus the prank calls have not stopped. I dont want to bother myself thinking about the calls .. like i dont have a zillion other things to think about.. but if the calls occur every single night to you, wouldnt you start to wonder who is making these fucking ( i cant be bothered to be polite now ..) stupid calls.. and WHY?????? last night i only had one and i didnt even hear the phone ring cos i was in the bathroom. i told zak if i could i would want to put a hoax on the culprit .. hahaha.. perhaps the perpetrator does not realize that i am a sarawakian afterall ( and a quarter melanau at that!) and if you go by the many stories that have been generated about us sarawakian is our ability to do 'black magic' or to make minyak or crap yang seumpama dgn nya.. and being part melanau means i do have the capacity .. although i have yet to try it out .. to turn my head 180 degrees... hahahahha .. so better watch out laa whoever is making these bloody calls .. you never know.. there may just be a potent potion in making to make you so sick you wish you were never born .. muahahahahhaa ( evil laugh )!!!!!!!!  Btw i watched the 3rd episode of Bollywood Stars last night. This time they have filtered the 6 finalists and there are only 4 left to compete for the chance to star in a major Bollywood film. And guess what? The underdogs made it .. the white drama student who, although she is a good actress and has a pretty face is a terrible dancer .. and the fat girl whom i am actually glad to have gotten through to the next round. I am a bit disappointed that the bitch sofia got through .. man she is a real bitch! no wonder her mom disowned her ... Last night's episode reminded me just how populated India is .. and how huge the gap is between the rich and the poor. They showed the slums where the poor live .. and sofia, being the airhead that she is , took pictures of the slums .. nothing wrong with that .. what was wrong was when she said .. she thinks she is a very artistic person and she saw artistic beauty in the slums .. TELL ME IF THAT ISNT JUST PLAIN IDIOTIC.  Argghh ... gottaa .. finnishhh .. thhhaaatt.. greeenn.. form. I knew that the baby i had chosen to write about in my form is a twin but i just realised this morning that i had been thinking it was twin2 when i had actually written down twin1's details .. i mean its a good thing this does not affect whatever i have written down in my form in anyway .. but just interesting how i couldve let such a mistake happen!
