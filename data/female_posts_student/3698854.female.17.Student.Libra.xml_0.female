I wont be there until you need me, so if u can struggle on your own some more that would be appreciated.  ‘ A promise made, a promise broken… ’  Can you tell if someone needs you by looking at them? I try but often I am mistaken and make an utter fool out of myself…and how do you know its YOU they need?   My friend made this promise to me before and she was not there when I needed her. She made it again only recently, I do not think I can handle another broken promise. Maybe it is a ‘trust’ thing, maybe I don’t trust her to be there… but I don’t think that is the case, I think it is more like I don’t think she can handle being there for me. In eng we watched King Lear and Edgar draws a blade across his skin, I heard her yelp behind me. To be there for me… what if I need her to be there for me when I draw the naked blade across bare flesh, could she handle that? She cant bear to see the scars, any of my scars, could she sit and listen as I tell her my tale of woe or would she be disgusted with me.  “   Cut the skin to the bone, fall asleep all alone, hear your voice in the dark.”   She seems to handle things by passing the problem onto others who are more “capable” of “helping”. I do not want nor need them. I make her angry with what I say.  Theresa of Avilla said “ Pain is never permanent ” I guess she did not reckon with my “engraving” into flesh. Pain IS permanent, it always will be. A tattoo of suffering, of torment, of agony. My barcode as the child of shadows, the daughter of the darkness. Permanent. Forever.
