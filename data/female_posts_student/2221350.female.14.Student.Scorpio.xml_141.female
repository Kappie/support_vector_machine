I think just about everyone knows a sick fuck or two. The puppy-drowning arsonist type. I have the esteemed pleasure of having one for a sister. She is the most awful person I know. She is a bastard, a fucker, a complete C---. ((now you see, I'm not a complete potty mouth, but there is most definitely no better word to describe Devon))    aaah! Now I know exactly why I'm writing this post! Because my mother and grandmother((secretly)) read my blog, and I want them to know what kind of sadistic shitmunch Devon really is. I want them to read this and think "what the hell?" "we should chloroform her ass like a rabid dog!" "she should be sent to maury povich and then straight to bootcamp" "I knew there was something wrong when they cut her out of me and the noon sky turned blood red and all the black cats in the neighborhood came to the hospital doors and died"  **************************************    well... I wrote this post yesterday when I was really mad at Devon, andeven though I still think she's a sadistic little fuck I'm too lazy to elaborate on the story. So I suppose all of you can just squirm with curiosity and never sleep again wondering about the mysteryof that particular fight.    everything is pretty hum-drum and boring around here in Tyler. Daddy and Roseanne went toDallasintending to stay overnight, but delays turned it into a 3 day thing and they finally came back tonight.   sorry folks... I just haven't been feeling like blogging lately, nor do Ihave anything to say.   I suppose I'm just tired and icky because of my ear. I've been taking some cousin of penicillin and all kinds of vitamins((because my dad is a vitamin nut)). He swore that if I took 9000 mg of vitamin C, which is 18 capsules, that I would feelbetter, and I hate to say it, buthe was right. I mean, I'm sure the penicillinand codeine have something to do withit, but still. I'll just be sooo glad when the damnt thing stops hurting...
