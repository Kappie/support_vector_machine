I argued for about 20 min and I finally got dressed and went out for a 30 min run. I was fighting to go because my normal route is getting very monotonous. I was trying to figure out where to run so it wouldn't be so boringand I found the perfect spot. I drove about 15-20 min toDana Point Harbor. It was one of the most beautiful runs I have ran in a long time. I took my time running around the boats and the water breaks andmade a point to say "good morning" to all the other passer buyers. I made sure to have fun with the run insteadof making it a chore. I am back showered and am not sluggish.I feel likeI can topple the world. Can't wait for tomorrows run and Saturday's long run.    Someone in the world is training when you are not, when you race himhe will win. Get off your butt and RUN!!!
