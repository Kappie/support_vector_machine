It really bugs me when people have no respect for others ... just have to hope I never attend a gig like this again. Some varied gigs coming up in the next couple of months ... well, a few, anyway. Elbow in Bristol at the end of September, Mogwai in October and iron maiden (yes, you did read that correctly!) in December!
