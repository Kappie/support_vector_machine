Now, on to a finer subject.   As you all probably already know, I went to the  urlLink Vancouver Art Gallery yesterday to see the  urlLink Andy Warhol  exhibit. It was really anastonishing and magnificent thing to see. Icertainly do recommend that all who haven't seen it go and see it. Since it was Thursday, we got in by donation. I gave a dollar, I did feelatrocious but I was saving up the rest of my money for pizza. After having seen great works of art, we (Me, Rachael, Kelsey, Sam and Rachaels mom)sauntered down to a little pizzeria down on Smithe and Granville. The pizza was sodelectable. A slice (which is about the size of a little bit more than a quarter of a large pizza) was only $1. The tax is included in the price. This place was a steal. I bought two tantalizing slices, a Jones'. After everyone bought them selves their dinners, we walked out of the pizzeria only to find an enormous crowd of Hoobastank fans, lined up for a Hoobastank concert. It was revolting. As we walked threw the mob ,so we could go back and sit on the steps of Robson square, we called out many "Anti-Hoobastank" things. It was worth it in the end.   On the way home, we listened to Kelsey's Velvet Underground CD. I must say, it was the perfect ending to the perfect day. I really should go down town more.
