I don't believe those rumors of "summer school is easy."  If anything it's A LOT more work then ever!!  I had another unit test today - guessed a lot of questions actually.  It's difficult to do old diploma questions and infer from article, sources, and pictures.  Knowing knowledge is one thing, but tests are another.  Truthfully, I actually do care what I get on it.  I did my best - that is what counts.  I am not going to worry or get fed up with anything.  I am simply going to just keep on working hard.  We have already written one position paper and have another like next week or the week after.  I have had like two unit tests and about five quizzes if not more.  I lost track along the way.  I haven't really made any friends in Summer School other than the ones I know, because all the people are strange and most of them know each other.  I am truly finding out what it is like to "go it alone."  Between Stampede, Monday Teen Night's, and Wednesday off trips that begin next week I am going to be a busy girl.  Next Wednesday if what I must wait for.  It is when I get to find out of Aaron is back for the Summer.  If God meant for us to be together he will be back because I LOVE him.  I miss him so much and breaking off at the end of last summer was a big mistake.  I gave up something that I have never had with anyone else.  I gave up a feeling that since I have not seen him, I have not felt it.  Love.  Aaron is a true example of love at first sight.  I didn't believe in it until I met him.  I need to see him again.  HEADLINE: Calgary Girls Searches for Long Lost Halifax Boy - That is going to be me if I don't see him for the next few years.  I can't go on that long with out him.  I need him.  I need to see him.  I need to talk to him.  I love him.  On Monday we are making shirts again this year and I think Chels and I are suppose to be brainstorming a good name to put on em' this year.  Last year we were the "South Side Girls," this year we have the cleaver idea of being the "South Side Womanizers" yeah now that's cool!! LOL ;)  On Wednesday we are doing some BBQ thing and doing disk golf.  I can't wait til' Friday cause I get to go to Stampede again and this time I am going to see the hypnotist cause he is like so amazing.  Then Saturday Meg and I are going to a Stampede breakfast in my area, then we are going to some Stampede lunch in McKenzie.  Then later that night I am going to the Chuck Wagons and Grand Stand Show cause that is like the best.  OMG I love Stampede, and it will such when it's over.  I am just about half way through Summer School too!!  Thank goodness.  I have such a passionate hate for social and history.  It makes no sense really, not like it ever did.  I have more common sense of current issues it todays world rather than the "old time" issues and conflicts that were occurring.  Whatever though, as long as I pass Social 30 all is well.
