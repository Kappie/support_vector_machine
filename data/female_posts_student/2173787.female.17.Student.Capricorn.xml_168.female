Its an amazing poem and one that hit home.  It goes on to talk about human nature being flawed, that we are not unearthly and that in the face of thunder we hide in the cupboard.  It also asserts that time moves on and we cannot go back.  Even if we could,  the past would not be perfect, we still would not be happy.  This poem made me uncomfortable, how is it that my dreams, my ideals don't exist?  That because of cowardice I will never move forward, changing my tomorrow so that it doesn't look like today.  Honestly I am a coward, I just hate to admit it.  I hate that part of me the part that is so intensely scared of being shut down, of being cast off.  I am sure that it is the reason that I feel so alone, that I'm so lost.  It is in this moment that I realize why I liked  The Awakening   and  The Great Gatsby  so much.  Edna and Gatsby looked out at the world and wanted something that didn't exist.  Every time I glance out my window onto the world I realize more and more that what I want doesn't exist.  If by some chance it does exist, then I will never reach it, because I am too scared to venture from my doorstep.  From a distance I can see what I want, what my ideal landscape is, yet as I approach it I realize its merely a veneer, reality gilded.  The things I am searching for don't seem to truly exist, at least not in the form that I yearn for.  The acceptance of that was enough to make me break down on my rounds as chauffeur,  As I played music and ignored the couple in the back seat, silent tears began to fall.  Losing your ideal images is heartrending and painful.  On a side note, my entire day was not bad.  I went out to dinner and a movie and Ben and Jerry's and Starbucks with Hannah, and those hours were a very nice reprieve from my thoughts of lost ideals.
