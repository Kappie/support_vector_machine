I've met them once already and they are very sweet, I'm sure I'll have a nice time there. We're going to visit their son who is in the navy (I think) so we'll go down to the harbour and see all the boats which will be nice. So around 4.30 this arvo I'll be moving to another house, but only for 2 nights.   And at 1pm today Im going off to the airport, again, to say goodbye to yet another oldie, Angela. Which I'm sure will be very sad...   I got an email from my host-sister-to-be when I go back to Australia today, v. exciting, I can't wait! She's invited me to visit her and her family in Denmark so I will definately do that :)  I probably wont be on for the next three days, but I'll be sure to update when I get back!  Cheerio,  Katie
