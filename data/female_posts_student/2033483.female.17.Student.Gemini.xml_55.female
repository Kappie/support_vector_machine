Renae didn't come so I was afraid that she wasn't going to make it to the show either and we'd all have to cancel our plans. As it turned out Jessica and her dad made plans and Megan decided she didn't want to go.  So all that was left was Alisha and I.  But, when I got home their was a voicemail on my phone (YEA, I can get my voicemails now) from Renae saying that she was still able to go.  But, Alisha decided not to come and, like always, Renae and I were left alone.  Before the show, we went to Arby's, which looking back I don't think we should have because I ended up getting a stomach ache from it and we reeked of Arby's all night.  But, we got there right in the middle of the first bands performance.  Jason we there which surprised me but he hung out with us for awhile.  Jason is a nice guy, ya'll in bloggerland would like him.  But the next band that played was LAW and the lead singer was something to look at let me tell you!  As far as musical ability goes I didn't hear anything special about them though and probably wouldn't rush to see another LAW performance.   Or maybe I would, that boy in the white shirt was hot!  After they were done, my ears were ringing because we stood so close to the speakers and they are still ringing, over 12 hours later.  I liked Onesiphorous.  I'm so proud I finally can say their name correctly, they will no longer be known as THE O band.   After their set I talked to Kurt a bit, which was nice because I haven't talked to him in ages it seems.  Then the all glorious WITNESS played.  I was upset I had to leave mid-set and missed my favorite song "John Wayne on Acid," but what I did get to see was worth my money.  They are awesome!  Normally, it takes me ten minutes to drive home but last night it only took me 3! Can you say speeding?  And I was still 1 minute late for curfew.  Once I got home I went to bed cuz I was wiped.    I have to address something here.  Brad, I didn't lie about not going as you can see it all depended on whether or not Renae would be feeling up to it.  And I don't appreciate being called a liar!  I only saw you once the entire night and then, you weren't even looking at me so how could I say hi? Now I've had enough!   Good day all! ~kayla
