On a high red roof Don Gato sat. He was there to read a letter, - (meow, meow, meow) where the reading light was better, - (meow, meow, meow) 'Twas a love-note for Don Gato!  "I adore you," wrote the ladycat, who was fluffy white, and nice and fat. There was not a sweeter kitty, - (meow, meow, meow) in the country or the city - (meow, meow, meow) and she said she'd wed Don Gato!  O Senor Don Gato jumped with glee! He fell off the roof and broke his knee, broke his ribs and all his whiskers, - (meow, meow, meow) and his little solar plexus - (meow, meow, meow) "Ay Caramba!!" cried Don Gato.   All the doctors they came on the run, just to see if something could be done. And they held a consultation, - (meow, meow, meow) about how to save their patient, - (meow, meow, meow) how to save Senor Don Gato.  But in spite of everything they tried, poor Senor Don Gato up and died. No, it wasn't very merry, - (meow, meow, meow) going to the cemetary, - (meow, meow, meow) for the ending of Don Gato.  But as the the funeral passed the market square, such a smell of fish was in the air, though the burial was slated, - (meow, meow, meow) he became reanimated, - (meow, meow, meow) he came back to life, Don Gato!
