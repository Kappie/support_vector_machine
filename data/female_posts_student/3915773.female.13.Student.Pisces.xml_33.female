Both plane crashes are completely unrelated. The first occurred at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday in New York; the second happened at 12:15 p.m. on Sunday afternoon in New Jersey. There were two people in both planes, all four of which died. No one else was hurt. While these events are tragic, I do not see how they appeared in a national newspaper, or why for that matter, the journalist chose to connect them. Also, at the bottom of the page, directly beneath the report on the plane crashes, there is a line that says, “Give to the fresh air fund.” Is this some form of a miniature advertisement or a subliminal message? Perhaps it’s just something that the New York Times is indorsing. Does anyone have any ideas?
