And if you haven't figured it out, well, I am back (in black) in New York City. And my address is... The blackout forced my family to go to New Jersey for two days, and so I am back! I had the worst time there; it was so boring. There was nothing to do; my little cousins were annoying the hell out of me. Now I am back and ready to do stuff. Someone please call me and see if we can do stuff. Summer, are you free tomorrow? Can you come to the parade? What about you Deadinside? Anyone?      HAPPY INDIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY (which is actually tomorrow)
