On the one hand, the "Next Blog" feature brings more traffic to your site but I've found that most of these people only stay a few seconds, if that.   But what IS cool is that my blog is popping up in searches on Yahoo! and MSN!  urlLink Someone searched  on MSN.com using the keywords "Olympic games 2004" and my blog came up! I think the search results change frequently so it might not happen everytime, but still cool nonetheless!        Same with Yahoo! - someone was searching for photos of Aus diver Robert Newbery and my site was returned! Wheee..
