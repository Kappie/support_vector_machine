Did manage to get to the university library and couldn't locate any of the books I wanted - found a few that might do the trick for my paper.    Finally got home Sunday evening around 5:00.  Stopped by Grandma's house and she fed us dinner and watched the boys while I worked on my paper a little while.  Have I mentioned yet how blessed I am to have such a supportive family?  I appreciate them so much.    Been sleeping late all weekend, so Monday morning at 5am is going to come way too early for my tastes...
