Jesse, Tara, Kayla, Vaughn, Darren, Logan, Andrew, and Tanner were all there. Plus I made some new friends. All in all, it was good.   Saturday was Valentine's Day. Since I was still at Tech, Paul was supposed to come to my concert. He called me on Friday night and informed me that he wasn't going to be able to come. His parents wanted to go on a date of their own...which is all swell and fine in my opinion, but it was the first Valentine's Day that I have been in a relationship. So anyway...he felt really bad and we were both sad about him not being able to come. We decided that we would just celebrate on Sunday.  Sunday it snowed. Sunday it snowed...a lot! During church (a mere 1 1/2 hours) we got around 3 inches. First real snow of winter. And it comes in FEBRUARY! Well, Paul and I had planned on spending the whole day together, but because of the snow, the play we were going to see was cancelled. So after some lunch at Fazoli's...he came over. He brought me 4 roses: one pink, one yellow, one white, and one red. It was really sweet because we have been together for four months. I gave him "The Fighting Temptations" on dvd. It was the first movie that we saw together in theatre on our first date. So it meant something to both of us. ....After Paul left, Chris came over and stayed the night. It was good times.  Monday we were out of school and I went to devotions. That was nice because we didn't DO anything--no one showed  up. There was talk of merging the two devotions (i.e. bryce's idea) and somehow I think we are going to try it. >_  Yesterday, Paul and I decided to skip church. So he came over and we played around and had some jolly good fun. Woot. I gave him some brownies (the rest of his V-day present) and a letter. He gave me a stuffed monkey (SO cute!! it has a belly button!!!) and a homemade card. Good times. Then we went to church and only showed up for the last 10 minutes or so. So yeah. Paul was going to say something to Bryce..but I think he is going to wait until Sunday-ish. After church Paul actually came to the Tech concert. The symphony band and the jazz band came down here for a concert. I hope that he enjoyed it, because I did. *And that's the way we do it when we drink a lot of beer!* Thanks to Keith for that one. (oh yeah, keith was at tech too). Well, I think that is it for now. So cya!!  FINGERS!!! AHH!!!
