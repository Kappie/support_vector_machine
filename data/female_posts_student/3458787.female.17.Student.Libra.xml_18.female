For example, cornflakes boxes always showed strawberries along with the cornflakes. I used to think there really were strawberries inside. How disappointed I was when all that was insidewas confakes that was not even honey coated!    At one point of time I more or less believed that spinach made you mighty strong. That was was watching Popeye the sailor man everydaydo to me!    Then there were these doll houses that theyadvertise repeatedly on TV. They always showed the houses with SO many dolls and even the doll house boxeshave pictures of dolls on them! Ihad many a time failed to see the faint print thatread " dolls and accessories not included" and beenfooled.    It did notmake much sense to me at that time when in cartoons, storiesand even in some movies animals could talk but in real live they never did.    When I think about all these things now, it isall so funny but when I was little these were the stuff that made me really disappointed hahahhahaha :)
