But I didn't know what the french word for Wales meant! Anyway how was I supposed to know she was Welsh? Basically, big OOPS. But I would never say that anyway. Mmm... I just need to go to sleep, that always solves everything, I need to recharge my hyper batteries. Then I got locked out of my house for a hour and a half cause my brother had my key and didn't leave it for me to find. I gave it to him cause he wanted to get it! Yup, definatly cursed. Then just generally being an ass all day, not good! Guess I'll have to bugger lent and go eat a load of sinfully dark chocolate. Sounds good, ne?
