Last night, I did something so wrong… Believe it or not, I was stupid enough to have felt so negative about darling just because he answered, “try my best” for my question. It took me hours before I could bring myself to call him. I knew I’d have to call because he can’t sleep if I don’t tuck him to bed but I simply refused to do so and at 12mn sharp, I received his sms.    “tis may b the last time I call u honey, as well as to wish u tis… but still, happy 1 mth n 25 days honey…”    I couldn’t be bothered because I was too angry and disappointed. Well… I waited till he messaged me again and this time, I decided that I can call him le… Hee! Making him wait for that couple of hours feeling paranoid is my way of punishing him. When I called him, he sounded real tired and also, dejected to a certain extent. I spoke with the coldest tone I could give and it’s probably the first time I ever spoke with him like that.    We argued for almost 1 hour, telling him how disappointed I was to hear him said, “try my best”. What do you mean by try my best? I keep asking… I want to know his definition, his meaning, his stand and all that I can find out. I told him; I don’t say try my best because it’s not a 100% positive answer… It’s not a satisfying answer at all!! We talked it out, everything that could save this short and sweet love of ours.    Guess what… I was so fucking shocked and guilty to know that he had requested a transfer just because there was one time I could not reached him on his mobile and I started imagining things which causes the lost of my appetite. He said he was really “xin tong” when he heard that I did not eat much because I was too worried… For that, the next day he typed a letter and sent to the Head Quarters, requesting for a change to office hours in the intelligence unit. I was so touched that I howled like a baby and asked him to forgive my negligence and also, my willfulness. He is so sweet and nice to me yet I still doubted his sincerity and had said so many things that probably penetrate his heart like a long sword, slicing the wound slowly and turning the blades again and again.    OMG! I wish I could just tell everyone how in love I am now and how fortunate I am… There’s probably not another person who loves me as much as he does. Really… This thought came to my mind immediately after our misunderstanding had been cleared. For this, he said our love leveled up again! **Tada** I must really bucked up and try losing as much weight as I can man… Though he thinks I am beautiful but that’s the face only… My body is so fat that sometimes I feel like dying!! I hate this fat ass of mine!    Today was such a nice and peaceful day. Hurhur! I woke up at 1pm and was on the phone with my sweet baby. He woke up around the same time as I did though I slept lesser cause I always tuck him to bed first. Yvonne was supposed to be on the way and I actually expect her to be earlier but she only reached around 2.20pm. Guess she had a hard time finding her way cause my location sucks to the infinite! I wasted so much more money just on cab fare! I hate taking public transports like MRT or the buses because some people are so uncivilized and disgusting… Yvonne and I had lunch together then she went ahead with her tanning session. I peeped at her couple of times to see if she is having fun on her own. Hee! I was too lazy to go under the sun man… BLAB!    At the same time, I was playing Yahoo Graffiti with darling and Jun. It was rather fun because we get to draw and guess. I am always the slowest… I can’t type fast ma… Two fingers only okie…. BLAB! I called Laura and we decided to meet up for dinner since she was in town, she wanted to go Harbour Front. Yvonne came backed after 2 hours and she went to bathe first. When she was done, I was still on the phone with darling. She nagged at me, saying, “zhen tian jiang dian hua, bu dong wei she mo jiang duo hua jiang!” HAHA! I went shower as soon as I put down the phone. Came out in 10 mins and started putting on my thick make up. AKKAKAKAKAK! They always say I looked so pale when I have no powder on my face.    We got to Harbour Front around 6pm and walked around for sometimes. I noticed a lot of people looking at me while I was walking, going up the escalator, taking money and even when I was talking… WTF is wrong with these people! I feel so uneasy when people stare at me… Be it they are looking at my fats or my face or my hair or my dressing or my posture or the way I carry myself, I just hate it! The weirdest part, there was this man who came into the restaurant that I was dinning in who keep looking at me just because I was looking his direction…. I was looking at those people behind him but seems like he thought that I was looking at him!!!! WTFX1O! I turned around and continue eating despite knowing the fact that he was looking at me all the while…. When I got up and proceed to the cashier, he stared at me from my table all the way to the cashier till I got out… FUCK THESE SICK AND HORNY BASTARDS!!!    Then we went to Mac Donalds to eat some ice cream. There was this super fucking ugly bitch sitting right opposite me and she too, keeps staring at me! WTFX100! She was with this short guy and both of them were chatting, I thought its only right to look at the person you are talking with but instead, she was constantly looking at me…. UGLY BITCH! Maybe she thinks I am so fat or what but I couldn’t be bothered cause, FAT CAN JIAN FEI BUT UGLY IS FOREVER! Unless she did some job to her face, then I’d say, “ SUAN NI TA MA DE HEN!” kakkakakakaka!    After Mac, Yvonne and Laura decided to head home and I was busy trying to find a place to go. I did not want to home because it was only 8pm and I think I looked damn beautiful today. Cannot just go home like that lah… PUI! DON’T PUKE PLEASE! Weili was engaged in a KTV session with Cai Yun in Clementi Party World. I wanted to go initially but heard some tone of reluctance and decided not to go then. Shh… CaiYun’s gf was there too lah! Then I called QP and PX but there were no replies from either of them and I got on the cab with disappointment thinking that I’d just head home loh.    Surprises are always around when you least expect them. PX answered her phone and we decided to meet up at Jurong Point, that lousy place! Sianz but no choice man. I reached JP at around 8.15pm and we decided to catch a movie. I accompanied PX to the second level and she had her dinner while me played with her phone. It was fun taking MMS but too bad, when I decided to send one special pic to my darling, I realized that her phone cannot send any MMS at all. Not via infrared nor normal MMS services and guess what, I looked like a fucking 17 in that pic! KAKAKKAKA! Now I finally know why there were always people telling me I looked like 18 when I was doing my attachment. Sob sob! Guess this is what we meant by, you don’t always get what you want….    Caught The Day After Tomorrow and it was definitely a fantastic show. Right after the show, I got on a cab and came home right away. Darling was on the phone with me on my journey back. He misses me so much and it goes for me, I miss him like crazy too! Hee! Well, got home and smoke a little then took my bath. Tucked my little baby to bed and then got online to check out people’s blog. Yvonne’s blog was damn funny. I was laughing as I read. Mich is such a failure when comes to being a elder sister I must agree!    Oh, too long for a blog I guess… Seems like I am writing a storybook! Nite!   Kisskiss!
