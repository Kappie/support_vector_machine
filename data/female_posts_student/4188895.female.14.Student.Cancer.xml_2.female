I'm really happy though because i'm home with my mom and I haven't seen her in two weeks! So yeah, i'm really happy. :) I've now gotten used to getting up at 5:00 in the morning so I guess that's cool. I'm still friends with the same people as always, which that is cool. And I made some new friends, YAY. Oh my god Alina, I want to read the rest of your story, it's so good! I was going to ask you for a copy! Please. ^^ Anyway, today, first period was math. And I got mixed up with my other classes and I kept saying the room number. F134. F134. F134. And of corse, ones are on the bottom floor and twos are on the top. So I was on top floor looking for my class while people were going to class and clearing out of the halls. So then I thought " Wait a minuate... my class is on the bottom floor!" So I ran as fast as I could down the hall and down the stairs whitch I aalmost tripped running down... And I finally got to my class before the bell rang. Woh, I've written to much...Ok, see you next post! (Sorry again for being late on posting)
