Just got home from  urlLink Mysterium and....oh...my....gosh! It was incredible! I couldn't have had more fun anywhere else. As I came in as a newbie to the myst community(having played the one player games and the beta - close of URU, as Katey,but never posting on any of the forums.) It really was an interesting experience. I hope next year will be just as great ^^ I guess I'll provide details later, both about Mysterium, and about myself. But for now, sleepy time.
