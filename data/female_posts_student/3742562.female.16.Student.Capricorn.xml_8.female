They're not everything I'd thought they'd be...but they are  *  cute  * ...  Didn't do much after I got up, started my laundry, bathed, cleaned my room...speaking of laundry...I need to get the last load out of the dryer...haha...whoopsies  Me and Brandon were  supposed  to go eat out tonight, but he changed his mind and we're gonna go tomorrow night and then go the mall for a bit and head back to his house. I was a little pissed and I don't know why... I really don't want to go at all ...he thinks he's gonna pay for half of my purse...I can only imagine what his parents must think about that...grr...I'm just so aggravated with the whole situation...  I signed up for this penpal thing on the net...I've been getting e-mail's...hopefully I'll find one I really like and make a great new friend...considering how many I have here...I need to move... Tennessee here I come !!
