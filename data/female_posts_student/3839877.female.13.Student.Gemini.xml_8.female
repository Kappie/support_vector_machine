Not much happening yet, we'll see.  4:55 Nothing yet...  5:45 Cheria  I went to a large grove, swamped with wasps and bees.  We ran like hell. Post again later...  6:18 Bored, we've been sitting here.  Watching  South Park  almost all day. Whee! Go Cartman.  7:17 We went for a quick walk in the neighbrhood, Cheria chatted with this guy I know from school. o.o  8:33 Just got back from a boring fireworks show. -.- I did get five Mozerella sticks and a grilled cheese sandwich.  9:39 Downloaded a couple of  Slipknot  songs. ^^  10:31 And I finally get on. Cheria has been wasting time by downloading 20+ R, rap and hip hop songs.  12:45 Ugh soo bored, watching more  South Park . Finished watching some thingy on  Playboy .  1:46 Nothing...  2:56 I just got in deep shit for being up so late. I can't get on my computer or tv tomorrow. Cheria can't spend the next night here.  This sucks ass. I fuckin' want to kill someone.  3:33 I just had this incredibly erotic thought of sex in the rain, on a covered patio. Or maybe just on the ground, a really rough fuck in the pouring rain. Now that's my idea of a good time. ^^ I'm such a freak like that. Gotta love it!
