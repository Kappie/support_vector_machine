I want to get a part. But I don't think I will. It's just one of those gut instincts. Or if I do, it'll be the same kind of part I've gotten this whole time. The kind of parts that can be shoved into a corner and ignored until you realize they have a line that wasn't said. Not that it effected anything. I don't want that.  But I dunno.
