You are used to thinking about others before thinking about yourself."  Could this be right?  I don't think so.  you know maybe there are truly people out there who do not think of themselves first, but i have yet to meet one, present company included.  I find that more often than not if i do something good for another person that im only doing it to help myself.  Whether it be trying to gain more trust from another person or even gain a connection.  There are so few people i feel connected to.  I used to feel like i was apart of something ya know.  Ha  how incredibly presumptious of me.  Bwahaha  as i look back and read this i can see why people like blogs.  it does kind of feel good talking about this stuff... its as if i had a close friend who was slighty interested in seeing  me , not in seeing how i can smile for- and please the crowd.  I read this kids quote and though i cant remember the exact words, it said something like,  "Those words, at best, were worse than teenage poetry."   How true about me.   Until Time Next.
