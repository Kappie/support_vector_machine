Frank:  "You know what my problem is....I have a lifetime subscription to you!"   Frank:  "You think your telling us something we didnt know?!" "Marie knows she is a pain in the butt!"  Marie:  "And Frank knows he is a pig with shoes on!"   Ok things to do if you had a bad day:   1. go to target and buy yourself some  flowers . 2. go to atlanta bread  company and buy a  chocolate chip muffin top (cause chocolate makes you happy)    3.   come home and watch  Everybody Loves Raymond  4. Find the  song  that makes you smile and listen to it on repeat 5.  Talk  to your favorite people 6. If all else fails go  lay in the road  around 7:30-8:00ish and just  look at the sky  and talk to somebody
