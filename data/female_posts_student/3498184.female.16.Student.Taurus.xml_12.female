I took Vicki, Marissa and I about an hour to find it. Finally we found out It's a weird guitar type thing. Haha. I got some cool stuff I got a necklace, a banana smootie (awesome), some of those little donuts from the stand, and a 1.90 peach that wasn't worth it. I guess you can't save money at the Pike Place Market.  OH! There was this old guy that rambled on about the ice cream place (where later on we bought out smoothies and Ice cream) for like 5 minutes staright. Not even Exagerating. It was sad, but funny. Oh well. The Museum was alright, the tour guide lady spent WAY too long on one picture. I liked when we go tot wander around for myself. It was awesome, I got to look at what I wanted, for how long I wanted. There was some odd stuff there. There was this photo  which was doctored to look like a human Ken doll. He was naked with no Penis, balls, or nipples. It was crazy. I really liked it. One that was awesome in it's own way was a photo of a man with a huge stitched cut on the top of his head, extending down to his cheeks on both sides.  It was crazy. Well, there's school tomorrow and I haven't taken my shower yet. Laterz ~Bailey
