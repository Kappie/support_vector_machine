Now fair enough I probably wouldn’t want to go anyway but the point is they didn’t even ask me.    And the person downstairs is playing loud dance music, so my floor is vibrating to the boom boom of her music.    Ok what would platinumblonde say: look at the positives….. errrrr….. I’m saving money, I’m having some time to myself, I’m developing my introvert abilities, and er nope can’t think of a positive to the dance music….any suggestions?  Actually though talking of introversion – I have managed really well at spending an entire week on my own in the office with no windows.  The radio and I are forming a very close relationship!  Haven’t even started talking to myself yet either.
