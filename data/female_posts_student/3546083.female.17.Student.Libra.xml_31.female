(sorry about that tony, but i really didnt wanna b there ne more than u did lol.) so then we tried 2 play gamecube again and succeeded this time. but i never got my hug lol. then i had 2 go 2 work and i listened 2 my aunt ranting and raving about stuff i didnt understand while she drove tony home. then i went 2 work. it was actually ok 2day. i only worked 5-10 and it actually went by pretty fast cuz it wasnt really hard 2day, but it wasnt really boring either. kinda that happy medium if there is one lol. and when there wasnt work 2 b done, i talked 2 my co-workers. lol time never seems 2 drag by when alfred is there (my "mighty green giant" lol). i dont know wut i'd do w/o him. i was so worried that my mouth would start hurting really bad again while i was at work and i didnt have ne pain killers. that would b pretty embarassing if that excruciating pain hit me right in the middle of the store cuz i might have just collapsed on the floor lol. but it didnt. it started hurting a little, but it was nothing i couldnt deal with... i might b able 2 get off saturday night 4 this race. that would b so awesome. i talked 2 one of the managers and they said they would ask walton 2morrow if he can switch shifts w/ me so i can work an earlier shift on saturday. but if i do run it i know its gonna suck since i havent run 2 much in the last week lol.... so yea neway i got home around 10:30, then talked 2 tony online 4 like 5 minutes b4 he had 2 go 2 bed. and now im just sittin here bored as nething wishin i had somebody 2 talk 2 lol. so yea that was my day 2day... im kinda worried about kenny. i kinda brushed him off earlier when he came 2 me 4 help cuz i had 2 go 2 work and i feel kinda bad. i think maybe hes back 2 cutting himself. i wanna help him but im getting so frustrated and i dont know wut 2 do. i thought he was over this, then he comes 2 me swearing that he wants 2 die bcuz they're closing down his karate studio. thats not something that healthy ppl get that upset about, but he swears he took his medicine 2day. i dont know wut 2 do nemore, but i dont think i can help him. mayb its just another one of his pitty pleas and i should just ignore it. or mayb he just wants attention. or mayb he really is goin 2 kill himself over a stupid reason like that and it would b all my fault. but then again, if he really wanted 2 kill himself he would have done it already instead of just making little cuts in his wrist. 2 me it seems like he just wants attention. cuz ppl that really wanna die dont go 2 other ppl 2 b talked out of it. so i think he just needs 2 b told by other ppl  that his life has some sort of value. or mayb just by me. if this is headed where i think it might b headed i need 2 stop this right now. mayb hes only comin 2 me cuz he thinks he'll get pitty and he wants me 2 feel like hes confiding in me, and he thinks ill take him back. i know if he wanted me back, he would never have the courage 2 just come out and ask, so this might b his way of saying it. if thats the case, i dont think i should try 2 help him nemore. but how do i know wuts really going on? should i really just turn my back on him? wut if he really is planning on killing himself, and i was just 2 busy 2 point out the value of his life when he came 2 me? i dont think i could live with that kind of guilt. i need 2 talk 2 him. hopefully he'll b on 2morrow.... so neway now im just sitting here wishing i could talk 2 tony. i dont know wut im gonna do these next 2 days... man some1 better come online soon, im gettin pretty bored. haha my mom IM'd me while i was gone 2 ask me how my date was, isnt that cute lol. but she's not on now. cuz NOBODY is on. lol but mayb thats just cuz its after midnight. ok fine, nobody's comin 2 keep me company, so mayb ill just go work on my puzzle...
