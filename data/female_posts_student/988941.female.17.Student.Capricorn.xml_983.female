And TOm I don't think Jackie is being hypocritical because yes she does drink quite happily at parties but she doesn't go out of her way to get drunk like Pennie and Helen. Jackie is one of these people where if there is alcohol she will have some, not loads, some. If there isn't then fine. It doesn't matter. I think? Jackie? Max - you never told me that. You haven't exactly blogged all aboutit like you usually do going on and on about the graphics etc..  You know how everyone seems to have 2 lines. One line is simple to get to, it can be crossed by something hurtful or by general stress. The second line is harder and when you get to it thats when you seriously start to think about things, life, people. Is it really worth it? I'm nearing that second line rapidly. I can't handle the amount of work I have. I don't have the time. I can't work any harder than I am now.
