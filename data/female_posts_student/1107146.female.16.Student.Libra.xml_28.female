Josh, I really have to say thanks for calling me "the wisest" earlier on in the lifespan of this site.  That was really sweet.  I have no experience in these kinds of problems, as some of my friends can't help reminding me about, so I will not get involved.  I have read the entire thing so far and I just want to be here if you need help, ok, Josh?  I shalt pass no judgement.  I am Switzerland, the neutral party in this war.    Okay, bad...metaphor? but get over it.  It's just my way.  See you all in Scumbucket tomorrow.  ;)  ~Z
