Unsteady In time's distance I catch up to you on a simple street, hold you in conversation a moment only. Turned from your purpose, you turn back again, the child round in you: it is, indeed,  late spring. I stand still, a prisoner of coincidence; you go  the way you must and I cannot follow you. Later, I come to your door, a stranger; the child  uncertain clings to you. There are only words  between us; I dwell on them, the silence in me stronger than words. My eyes grow mute in twilight, and I live in the sound of you. I imagine  the ballet of your fingers; they, too, are silent movers of thought. I have never seen you work your words. Somewhere I wait for words that flash in air. Unsteady at my post I watch at each new corner for you to turn again.    damn nigga, i remember tha evenin i showed you that shit..damn...i love everything about you. e v e r y t h i g .    damn, i love you so much.    this is how i feel..every single time..
