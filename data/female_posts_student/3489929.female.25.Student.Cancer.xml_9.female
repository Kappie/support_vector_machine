Not "Good morning." That's too much to hope for. No, the first words out of his mouth are, "I have already gotten 2 complaints about rudeness so the next one I get, I'm knocking that person down to $5.15/hour for the entire week. No explanation, no justification."  I wonder if one of them was about me (probably was). I know one of them was about Crackhead. She talked to a woman today who was bitching about being on hold, and Cracky had her on mute, and heard the woman say to the person in the background, "I'm getting a fucking headache from this shit." Cracky got back on the phone: "You have a headache? Maybe you should take some Tylenol for that. How can I help you?" Customer did not appreciate that very much.   This is my influence.  Oh, well.  There is war being declared in my department because two of us (Barbie and Cracky) are not answering the damn phone when it rings, and two of us (Blondie and myself) are picking up the slack. Very, very annoying. I have spent the day bitching and complaining and making notes and insisting that we have a meeting this week so these issues can be addressed. And they haven't been.   Oh my Gawd. I almost forgot. Cracky took off her bra in front of everyone today. Did not need to see that. And considering that she sits in front of a huge plate-glass window, I'm certainly hoping no one outside saw that either.  She is so gross. She gets these scabs on her forehead all the time and she sits there with a mirror propped up on her keyboard and picks at them and squeezes them all day long. Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Take it to the bathroom, Grossy-Gross. At home. Far away from civilized people.  I hate that this entire post has been dedicated to work, but I need to let it off somehow. I cannot wait until August.   There's no place like school... there's no place like school... there's no place like school...
