I remember thinking about how this day was so long it was like every minute stood out in relief against itself. I would stare at the clock and was able to count the time in between the seconds. And to top it all off, survivor wasn't even on.  Friday was even worse, as it was the last day of school before spring break, but when I finally got home I was able to truly chill, I just kind of splayed out like you do when you've been sucking your gut in trying to hide the fact that your dress is too tight but you're always competing with your stupid cousin on who's the skinniest so you've been sucking it in for like 6 hours and then you peel off the pantyhose and just.... Relax.  has anyone ever noticed that when you have an adrenaline rush, say like a concert or a big party or something, that you kind of lose your memory of the whole thing. Like when I come home, I feel like whatever gave me the particular rush actually happened the day before instead of hours before. It's weird.  to my own great satisfaction, I was able to flawlessly and legally get my sister into serious trouble. And regardless of how immature and stupid this sounds, it was grr-eat. This entire week every time the grandmother would tell her to do something she would mutter "fuck you, bitch" under her breath. So I, hating her guts as usual, told mammaw, who yelled at her, then mammaw told momma, who also yelled at her. Now she has been put in her place and maybe she will shut up for a while.   ((so pin a red rose on my ass!))  of course I don't think any of that will affect our relationship, she still managed to scream "SHUTUP" at me in the middle of the grocery store. I confronted her about the five bucks she owes me for writing her report a couple weeks ago. I swear to god if I have to sue her fuckin grandkids for that five bucks I will get it and I will be buried with it.   mom came home from Los Angeles Friday afternoon. She had a fabulous time, even better than she thought she would. She brought me three tee-shirts. One pink one((gag me.. Pink?!?)) that says Beverly hills, one that she bought at the airport that says new Mexico((WTF))((she bought it because it was all scrunched up into this tiny package and you pour water on it and it puffs into a shirt))((it's cool)), and my personal favorite, a shirt that says ROSCOE'S HOUSE OF CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. I've always wanted to visit Roscoe's since I saw it on food network. She said that she and Steven((her bf)) fixed a waffle and didn't touch it and said it was my waffle. I'm tearing up now just thinking about it.((yes, crying over a waffle, how will I ever manage?)).  mom says that she will take me with her and Steven when they go back in may. I did the smart thing and didn't get excited, but you never know.  now today... Saturday...  today was super busy. I woke up at 5 fcuking thirty because mammaw booted me off the couch where I had unintentionally sleep-walked. So then we went to wal-mart and bought dirt. Then we bought shit-munch an outfit for her banquet((shit-munch being little sister Devon and the banquet being some dinner she's going to which is included in a trip to Alexandria she'll be going on with her art class)). As if taking a shopping trip with Devon isn't draining enough, I then hauled the dirt to my ex-step-grandmother's house((Mimi)). So for like, 6 hours, I potted and watered and weeded and dumped and hauled and clipped and bullshitted and petunianated. Then I took a nice break for a couple hours and headed off to babysit at 5:30. So then I was finally home at 11:00 but I had to sweep and mop the floor so I did that too and now I'm finally winding down and ready to pass.   my uncle, aunt, and two cousins are on their way from Ohio right this minute. I don't know why they decided to strike out driving at 4 o' clock in the afternoon and drive all night long, which means I'll be stuck with kids while the aunt and uncle crash tomorrow, but they did so I guess there isn't much I can do about it now. Seriously, don't think I don't love them all to death, but they can be a handful and a half.  1. My adrenals are really messed up, so I never need to sleep as much as most people. 2. If I had to choose between being alone all the time and being with people all the time I would choose with people all the time. 3. My eyes are soo weird. They have a ring of blue, green, and light brown. My mom says it's because I don't get enough vitamins.... 4. I love making stuff, and I always have to have something to do with my hands.  5. For a couple hours after I read a good book, I narrate whatever I'm up to in my head. For example tonight I was thinking "as she dragged the mop across the floor and tried not to think about the futility of her actions, she wondered if there were any philosophical messages she could pull out of mopping. Finding herself at a loss for frilly words and answers to the world's problems embedded in household chores, she dragged her tongue across her lips and smirked."  so now I believe I will go to bed.
