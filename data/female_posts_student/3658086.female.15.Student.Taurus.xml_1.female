Certain people in my year are so out of order its not even funny.. some people think they can tell me what to do.. dunno how that works. I've just been informed (to my face aswell) that I am up myself because I said that without me and charlotte (the two strongest girls in our year) doing the tug of war they were pretty screwd. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. and a certain person (ask me about that... not writing down any names in case someone unwelcome is reading this..) seems to think that they are some bl**dy genious who should really be in set 1 for everything (their set 4 ratio is v. v. high) and that she is in fact ,uch cleverer than she really is.. o and did I forget to mention talented in every way... grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr I'm so angry. anyway i have to go and write some sh***y report that I have been ordered to write by... yes thats right one of my friends.. grrrrrrr omg I'm such a b***h
