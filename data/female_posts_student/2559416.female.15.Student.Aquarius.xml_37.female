He was a boy that liked exploration and he always said that he will dedicate all his life to go on adventures all around the world doing what he liked most, climbing. He had a great childhood, but when he was an adolescent he had a bad incident, he was kidnapped and kept for almost a year. But even though he had this bad experience in the past he had dreams of going to the highest mountains and reaching the top. Actually one of his adventures happened two weeks ago, when he decided to make a journey to El Cocui Snow Mountain. He was so excited he couldn’t wait one more day; he packed and got organized and left everything ready for his trip. Finally, the perfect and expected wild day arrived. He got on his car turned the radio on and left the station where they were giving the new because he wanted to know how the climate was on the area. Few minutes latter he stopped surprised of what he had heard over the news. He was really worried and scared, “The Cocui was filled up with guerrilla and the kidnap statistics was of a 90% probability.” But even though he was scared and not really sure if he should continue, he filled with courage and carried on with his dream.  The next day he arrived to one of the most dangerous mountain of El Cocui, named La Laguna de los Verdes. Bill started to feel and smell the soft and comfortable aroma of the wind and he saw the beautiful colors of nature; he felt so secure and happy, he knew that he was where he belonged, free and in peace. After a moment he heard a really strange noise that made him come back to reality and remember his past and what he had heard the day before. He was frightened, he felt as if he were living a flashback. He heard some gunshots, he was frightened, he didn’t know what to do he was paralyzed; he just wished he had returned when he had the chance. He started to run in no direction and after a while of running he ended up in a dark and endless cave. He didn’t notice that in the cave there was some ice blocks falling from the top and that in the floor there were some human footsteps, so he continued walking knowing that there he would be secure. After a while of walking, he heard some screaming; they came from far away, it seemed to be from a girl, a KIDNAPPED girl, who was screaming for help. He continued walking and when he least expected he was eye covered and he felt that someone grabbed his arm and painfully twisted it to his back, he felt as it thy were taking his arm away. He heard a man’s voice ordering him to walk, but because he was so scared it seemed difficult to do it. After a while of not knowing to where he was taken, he heard the girls’ voice again. Every time the girl voice got closer, and closer. Then instantaneously the bandage was off and he had the chance to look down and when he did he saw a small girl. The man made him sit down beside her and ordered him to stay quiet. Even though the man told him not to, he talked for a while with the girl letting the time pass and the night to arrive. When it did arrived he didn’t remember falling a sleep. At some point in the middle of the night he woke up all sweaty. He was home, in his bed and the day of his journey hadn’t arrived. He realized that he was living a lie, everything was ok when he figured out what had happened he calmed down, nothing was happening. He would be living tomorrow and his trip was going to be the first of so many trips to come.
