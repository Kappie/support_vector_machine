I found this really cool site with the button game! and you have to press the button within the time limit and then you have to presss it as many times as you like, and then you can end the game whenever you want! Sounds lame? It is! But theres a grand idiots hall of fame - it measures your idiot level by how long you spend clicking the button! Dont interrupt me! I'm exactly 843 clicks away from getting into the hall of fame!!
