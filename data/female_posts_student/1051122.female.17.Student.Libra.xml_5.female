I won't say more than that ... I'd jinx myself.  What was today? (Two Ap exams in a row, pizza, gerbils and a very wise saying.) Samantha Figueroa asked me what I wanted to do in Spanish class yesterday, and I told her I want to make it possible for more Americans to have health insurance.  So she said to me, "I don't know what you feel about what's up there ... but you know, you'd get mad points with him." And that got me thinking more than anything else ... is there a God? I honestly don't know what to think anymore. I'm so FRIED.  Anyway ... everytime I write SF I feel better, although it's thoroughly depressing at the same time. So I'm going to keep going. And hopefully, sometime, I can read my work and say, "Well ... I've gotten a damn sight better since then."
