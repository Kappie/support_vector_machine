(I'm sure Dale could figure this out anyway, though...)  Yesterday, I saw "Spider-Man 2" a second time since Dale still hadn't seen it.  There was this weird line in the middle of the screen throughout the entire movie and it was really bothersome, but besides that, the movie was great (obviously)!  Before the movies, I went to the Short Hills Mall with Dale and bought a bathing suit!  After the trip to the mall, Dale and I ate pizza at Romanelli's with Amy and Krysti.  Sadly, I now do not have much money left so I am awaiting my paycheck, which is supposedly arriving on Thursday, with much anticipation!  On Saturday, I didn't accomplish anything because I was working at the snack bar for almost five hours.  I   did  get a two dollar tip though!  ^_~  On Friday, I watched "King Arthur" with Krysti and Jess M.  We knew that the movie didn't have good reviews beforehand, but oh well...  The moral of this is: don't see bad movies and save money!  Okay, okay, so the movie wasn't   bad  , but it wasn't good either.  Today, I'm just hoping I'll do something later or have something to look foward to doing...  -_-;;
