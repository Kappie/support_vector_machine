Lina did my hair. it looked awesome. hairspray really does make the world go round...or keeps it together. i still haven't washed it out but my scalp hurts from the half hour it took to take it all down. all those rubber hair tyes and the bobby pins. oh the humanity!  darian was a really fun prom date. i picked him up and sadly he didn't know how to put on his bow tie (clip on) and his cufflinks. haha...that's awesome. but we figured it all out. good thing trevor was there to save the day. i figured out the tye but i'm new to cufflinks.   grand march was an adventure. it was bad enough having girls all around me freaking out about what to do. *breathe* but sadly my shoe did get caught in the blue stuff on the stage. oh well i don't think i ripped anything, maybe just a little pride. but i smiled pretty and i got cheers from people in the center isle.   the dance was fun i got a lot of pictures, in regards to the amount of pictures i usually take. everyone was beautiful and looked "sharp." i even got to wear the ever famous hat. *i wish i looked good in hats* i was also given the best compliment ever, "...for a white girl, you've got rythm." *flex* i was also deemed "the one who can dance" *flex x2* i'd say the dance was the best part of prom.   sadly darian couldn't come to the after party. he was bummed and i could tell. i couldn't do much about it unless he wanted to put up a fight with his parentals. the hypnotist was great and the pizza wasn't bad either ;) i never knew that matt had such an imagination. he even had a good rap ;) he'll always be my favorite liberal democrat.  the answer to all lifes tough choices: Is it on sale, -Betso
