It starts like this...ahem...Once upon a time there was a fish named squishy and he swam and swam, well, he just kept swimming...the end. *silence* ok, so that's crap...I don't care.  I'm thinkin of taking up directing. For the fall play, I'm gonna sign up for student director. That way, I can have a say in everything. And if I were student director for Our Town, that would majorly be an honor cuz that's his last play and I would be his last student director. Wow. lol. But for now, I'm quite content. GO THESPIS! Speaking of directing, one day I would love to make a non-crappy version of Lord of the Flies. Of course, I haven't seen the original so I might rent it...hm...But yea, the ending is gonna be hott. The last images you see are a tear rolling down Ralph's cheek and then falling. The camera "follows" the tear that is reflecting the flames of the burning forest...and then there's an uber close up of the flames and it goes to darkness...it's my vision, and I'll stick w/ it lol. It's dramatic, it's moving, the public will love it. I could even write the script. That would be fun. Anyone wanna help? We will make Lord of the Flies loved by EVERYONE. Cuz not everyone likes the thought of kids going crazy and the darkness of man's soul. The loss of innocence. Piggy, you rock my socks dude. I don't wanna give anything away to those who read this Blog which is like 2 ppl...but I dunno if you *Tasha* have read it. If not, I'll get it for you for your birthday in a month and 8 days. *YAY!* You can pick me up and then we'll go partying! lol I doubt that this is about 800 characters long and that kinda upsets me...  I have this song stuck in my head, I'm kindly sharing it w/ ya!  "We Beseech Thee"  Father, hear thy children's call  Humbly at thy feet we fall  Prodigals confessing all  We beseech thee, hear us!   We thy call have disobeyed  Into paths of sin have strayed  And repentence have delayed  We beseech thee, hear us!   Come sing about Love!  That made us first to be  Come sing about Love!  That made the stone and tree  Come sing about Love!  That draws us lovingly  We beseech thee, hear us!   -Sick!-We come come to thee for cure  -Guilty!-We seek thy mercy sure  -Evil!-We long to be made pure  We beseech thee, hear us!   -Blind!-We pray that we may see  -Bound!-We pray to be made free  -Stained!-We pray for sanctity  We beseech thee, hear us!   Come sing about Love!-Love!- That made us first to be  Come sing about Love!-Love!- That made the stone and tree  Come sing about Love!  Love! Love! Love! That draws us lovingly We beseech thee, hear us!  By the gracious saving call  Spoken tenderly to all  Who have shared man's guilt and fall  We beseech thee, hear us!   By the love that longs to bless  Pitying our sore distress  Leading us to holiness  We beseech thee, hear us!   Grant us all from earth to rise  And to strain with eager eyes  Towards the promised Heavenly prize  We beseech thee, hear us!   Come sing about Love!-Love!-  That made us first to be  Come sing about Love!-Love!-  That made the stone and tree  Come sing about Love! Love! Love! Love! Love!  That draws us lovingly  We beseech thee, hear us!  it's so catchy...dontcha think?
