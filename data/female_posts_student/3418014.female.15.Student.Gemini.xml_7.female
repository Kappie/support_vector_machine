Rowling slips them in so casually that I didn't even realize it, probably because I was speed-reading to get to the end, but still, they're great lessons. Of course there are the basics with the racism against the muggle-borns, the mirror of Erised (relating to my previous entry, about 10 minutes previous), basic love principles, Dudley's greed, then the one that's most important to me, human feelings. Dumbledore said it throughout the books, but it became most obvious in book 5, "it is our feelings that make us human," that's probably not a direct quote, but whatever. I wish I remembered that a few months ago, I've never told anyone this. Around the end of May I had a lot of stress, mostly from school projects, but I was depressed one night because I felt unwanted, in P.E., my speed away team ignored me, I'd tell them I was open, when I was right in front of the goal, they'd ignore me, I knew I was the one that they didn't want, the one that got stuck on their team, last one picked. I don't remember everything else I was feeling, but there was a lot. I felt that my life was crap, but then I was thinking about how great my life is, and how I thought I didn't deserve to feel that way, that I wasn't really feeling bad, just being a selfish greedy complaining drama queen brat. I was in my room with the lights off and door closed, crying on my bed. I wanted to do something to prove myself, to prove that I really did have a problem, that I was sad. I didn't want to leave my room, I didn't want my family to see me crying and puffy-eyed like that. I used what I had, I dug my nails into my wrists as hard as I could, I didn't choose my wrists because of the veins there, I did it because the skin was thin and the closest to my fingers. My nails weren't sharp and I barely drew blood as hard as I pushed my nails into the skin, as hard as I scraped I only got a few drops of blood. Afterwards it felt better. It's weird. The next day I stared at my wrists, little red marks were where my nails were. Pathetic scars from the night before. Little pathetic, sad, reminders of how pathetic I was. I thought about doing it again, digging deeper, to prove again that I wasn't a drama queen trying to hurt herself for more drama. I didn't. Instead I just stared at my scars, still slightly visible today, and thought about what I did. Now I know that I wasn't being bratty when I did it. Everybody has emotions, they make us human, I had every right to feel that. We all do, it's why we're human. I don't have to repeat that to prove to myself that my feelings are legitamate. I feel what I do and I can't control that. I wish I remembered Dumbledore's words back then, but now everytime I look at my wrists, see the little marks left, that no one else would reckognize as anything, and I can hear Richard Harris's voice, from playing Dumbledore in the first movies. "It is our emotions that make us human."
