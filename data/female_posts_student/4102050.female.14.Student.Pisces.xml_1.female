No! I will not take part in any of this. I refuse to be part of their problems in any way. The only thing I will do is be there for them when they need a shoulder to cry on, Give them advice when they need it, and show them that I love them. I wish someone cared about me, listened to my problems the way I listen to theirs. Someone who will do the same for me as I do for them...  I feel hurt to think that my friend thinks that I value winning a competition over her friendship. Well, to tell you the truth Jessica I value our friendship more...  And Tricia pick a guy that you really like and stick to him. One that isn't going to cheat on you, one that you really care about, one that you really want to be with and stay with him, no matter what others think of him or how he acts. There is my advice to you. But since you will never read this why did I even write it.  I find this completely pointless and very relaxing. I think I am goign too call it quits today and go find a spot away from life where I can reflect on everything I said and how it is going to hurt people.  Goodbye.   ♥Jeanne♥
