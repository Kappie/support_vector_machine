I sleep early (in da mornin') n wake up late (yeah, i mean late), might as well be vamps. i broke up with WL yesterday. reason i wanted to end our relationship: 1. I don't even know his birthday. ( he just won't tell.. that's all) 2. It's sort of cyber kinda relationship ( i've tons of unsuccessful cyber relationsip) 3. I don't think i REALLY luv him. ( no offense) 4. I'm still too young ( at least i think so.. n my mom says so) 5. I've got my study to consider ( my grade's sux) 6. He's not rich ( not that i really care.. but at least.. Handphone is a "must-have" kinda stuff) 7. He might be handsome but what does matter is whether is he tall. ( coz i am. well, not REALLY) 8. It's just a stupid game that might hurt me ( might as well i hurt him -- oh.. how wicked.) 9. Well, he's just not my type ( wonder wad's my type of guy)  Actually, there's a more serious stuff to consider rather than think 'bout him. for example, my mom's gonna be here this evening 'n my room sux. It's damn messy, i dun even know if i can tidy it up at least. i should have it tidy actually by now. Now, let's move on...  Talking 'bout my grade that sux. it does improve actually, BUT sadly i still FAIL. 'n talkin' 'bout sch, i've got tonnes of HW that i hav not   touch  . yesterday -- or issit the day b4, i visit asknlearn 'n discovered more homework. I think they (the teachers) r killin' us. - u know kinda burried us alive, with homework.  actually i've got lots to say. just not sure where to get started. well, i guess it's enough for today. thx for WHATEVER. :P  xoxoxo
