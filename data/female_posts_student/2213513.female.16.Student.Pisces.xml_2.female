Sushi, Apples, Cascade, Salamander and Zehas, Odin was with us for like half an hour but didn't acutally do any of the running around. First we all met up at Lloyd Center and then from there made an unplanned stop at this oreintal store, it was the coolest little place and we got these sodas that were sooo cool! lol, I can't really explain it but they were just awesome. Then we went to Saturday Market and listened to the live music for like 10 minutes and went to pioneer courthouse square and went pee and saw Wolf! the nurse from outdoor school! Then from there we went to Powells books and played Sardines, which was a lot of fun. Sardines, if you don't know, is like hide and seek but when you find the person you hide with them and then the last person to find everyone is it. And if you haven't been to Powells downtown, its HUGE! Theres like 10 different sections of books and most of them are really big. Then from there we got pizza at Roccos Pizza, I had never been there before but it's a cool place. The pizza is pretty good, not as good as Escape from New York Pizza but pretty good. So then after that we were heading back to nowhere, just kind of wandering and Zehas, Sushi, Salamander and I ended up ditching Apples and Cascade because we ran around a corner when they went into a store. So they went to Nordstrom and we followed them and then finally got back on the max and went back to Lloyd Center and then Zehas, Cascade, Sushi and I wandered for 10 minutes and then I had to leave. I had a great time though, even though we really didn't do anything. But yeah, since I spent all day just wandering around tomarrow I have to do a bunch of housework and homework. It was worth it though. I also have to look for a winterball dress tomarrow! Well I gotta go, talk to you later homes! lol  *Kate ~love is like a role that we play
