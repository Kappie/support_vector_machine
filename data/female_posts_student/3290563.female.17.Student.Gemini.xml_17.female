I'm pissed off that Evie would stab Tracy in the back by saying everything she did was learned from her. That's total bullshit. Oh and then I started crying. The end was great but made me cry. When Tracey's mom pulled back the arm of her shirt to show her scars. Wow. I'm gonna hafta watch it again soon.  So yea...leaving messages on Laurne and Kayla's phones are great. I love it lmfao. Laurne's laugh is fucking adorable, and the way Kayla talkes is adorable. Awwww. The powdered toast man is coming to get me and I'm hiding from eem! Teehee!  Was finally able to submit my thing for the AS yearbook! Woot!  Something's wrong with Laura and she won't tell me. I've been kinda holding back from her for some reason. I think I'm just totally distracted with mIRC and shit like that lmao. Being oblivious to things when I shouldn't be. Gotta make a mental note to see what's going on with her.  I was going to post a poem but it won't post on here for some reason.  Much love
