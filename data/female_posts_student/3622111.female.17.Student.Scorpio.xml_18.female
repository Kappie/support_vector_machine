But I was like the "middle-person"...I'm with those who started to join the team in July...but they're all very small children and 師父 said I was not going to practice the same swimming programme as them...There're about...6 teenagers...I think they're 師兄師姐...However, they don't know that I'm joining them...(and they swim so damn good)=P but that's OKAY...at least I can rest whenever I like and I swim whatever I like to swim and I don't need to follow any programme...(maybe just for the first time)...don't know about today...but I'm surely going to get nervous again soon...-_-" 肚"or" recently...for about one week already...I think that's coz of the "nervous-swimmming"...    I HATE going to school nearly everyday for only few hrs doing "mou liu" stuff...at least not SO early...-_-" -_-" -_-" And those 補課...really SO MANY! Those SChs ones and those outside tutorial classes...I can forsee my so-call Summer Holiday is going to full of ....=P oh...HEy...col...the SAT word list...^^" I'll hv to start revising...gr...If u're too busy to type...then don't keep it to ur 5-week camp ...=P     Sigh...SOCOM...This's just SO unfair...Vice and Pred also don't hv the responsibility to pay the gathering...-_-" I see why Amy is OKAY to paying 1/2 of the bill...wel..she's one the SOCOM member last yr...If she refuse to do that...then that's not quite gd...for me..1/4..that means ~$400...frankly..I really don't want to pay that...It's not my duty...tho Amy said it's a Tradition...well..a VERy unfair and bad tradition then...-_-" This's not a gathering at all...Mishellshell......-_-"
