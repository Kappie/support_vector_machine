It is quite simple really. When I got home from school yesterday I went straight to my bed and fell asleep for a bit. The storm yesterday was pretty cool. I love thunder and lightning. It kicks ass. I went out in the rain yesterday and played in it for a bit. That was fun. Today I have to be at school from 6 to 8 tonight for the lame science fair. Oh well. Sadly, I would have nothing better to do anyway. I need some sleep...hmmm...I've recently discovered that I like the song Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand. It is a cool song. The music video is a little weird however. I SHOULD REALLY be doing homework for physics right now, but I'm not. Oh well. Hmm...I haven't checked Josh's blog yet today, but then again I won't be surprised if he hasnt updated. Oh well. I need to figure out what my plans are for this weekend. I might do something with Holli and Erin during Friday since we wont be having school. Also, I MIGHT do something with Amanda on saturday, and tera. However, that one im not really sure about. If we dont do it this saturday, we will some other time tho. Hmm...well I think I'll be going so I can do my stupid homework.
