School was boring...hmm, had a teacher say shit to me...which she's going to be in trouble for now. hah..anyhow, I came home and talked to William for a while. I took a nap after that because I was tired..and here I am, STILL tired. I'm actually waiting for Ashley to get on. I just found out that I have to go have breakfast with a very old friend of mine. Grr...She's like 17 now I think. I am going to be the youngest, Im sooo mad. I dont want to see her, It's been so long! Maybe, 7 years or so. Errr...Im scared. Bored out of my mind..Im leaving.    Eww..My arm pits smell. :-P hehehe..
