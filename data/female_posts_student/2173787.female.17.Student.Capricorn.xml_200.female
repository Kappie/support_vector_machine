It doesn't piss me off so much as catch me off balance. Realistically, what's the point of it?  At least heckling might have some possible outcome, but beeping as you go speeding by at 30 mph?  What's with that?  I'm going to stop now because this isn't helpful. It's been slowly driving me crazy for a while now.
