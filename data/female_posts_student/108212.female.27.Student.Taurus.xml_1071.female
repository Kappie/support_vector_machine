What I like about it is that now I my mail has a direct relationship with  urlLink Blogger .  For those of you that constantly email me for questions and comments about your experiences with  urlLink Kinko's , please take note and change my email on your data base.  For those of you that spam me, please stop and no I dont want a credit report nor do I want to refinance my mortgage let alone need to know where my lost classmates from grade school.  AAAAAlrightyyyyy  then!
