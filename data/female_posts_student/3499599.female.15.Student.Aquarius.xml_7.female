I lost to a person that was nice. And she was polite and showed all the right courtesy for a tennis match. The other girl, though...agh.  1. She tried to hit me. Many times. When I would turn around to go back to serve and she had gone to get me a ball and was throwing it over, well, let's just say I had to dodge the ball a few times. "Oh...sorry" yeah right -_-  2. She questioned my calls, after she kept hitting them out and they were about a foot from the line and..oh, I don't know. But..well, after the match, my Mom said "It's a really good thing she said that, because I knew you would be so pissed off that you would actually start playing." And she was right e.e That's my ultimate pet peeve. I mean, I try very hard to keep my line calls right. Occasionally I'll just let one slide, if I'm not really sure about it. Aggh.  3. The people there to support her kept clapping when I would hit a ball into the net. My Mom did that a few times, at my first matches. I glared at her..a lot. I cannot stand it when people do this. It's okay to clap if someone hits a winner, or a really good shot. But..clapping just because a ball went out, or went into the net? That's my other ultimate pet peeve in tournament matches. It gave me enough anger to win, at least e.e;  4. Ok..the first set was 6-2, me. She was coming back in the second set and we were tied 5-5, and a couple of times she kept holding onto the tennis balls because she figured that the game was over..like..it would be 40-0, her. My serve. And instead of giving them to me, she would keep them because she just assumed that the game would be over the next point and..enh. I was just angry o.x;  Anyway. I won..6-2, 5-7, 10-6. I won the first set, she won the second set (I kept kind of screaming "NOOOOOOoooooooooooo" in my head during those last points), and then she just lost it when we did the 10-point tiebreaker. That was when the clapping was at its worst, and her "Oh my GOD come ON Caroline! GET IT TOGETHER!" peptalks were also at their worst. ^_^ It makes me laugh when people talk to themself like that, even though I know I do it too. heheh.   Oh yeah. My second game I lost 6-2, 6-0. x.x; Like I said, I got really lazy. And really tired. I'm out of shape >  I think I'm gonna go sleep now. Or just wander the net aimlessly. Neither of those require the use of my brain so..yeah.  Song for today: Pass That Dutch by Missy Elliott heheh. I found this by looking for the Mean Girls soundtrack. I like Missy Elliott's music ^^; My favorite part is near the end, when it sounds like the water-pipe part of Stomp.
