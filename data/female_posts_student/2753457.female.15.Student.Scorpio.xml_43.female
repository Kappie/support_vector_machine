I had trouble getting into it up until last night when I wrote eight pages.  I don't think it's gothic enough.  Honestly, to me it seems more like a cross between my life and a teen movie.  The idea came to me in a dream I had on Friday night, although I changed it a LOT.  I took the girl's name from the dream and the basic plot.  I have had fun with the whole thing.  I'm still trying to tie the climax of the love story and the supernatural event in.  I'm planning that this girl will lose her virginity and then get into a huge fight with her mother about it.  That'll be fun to write.  Mother/daughter relationships are interesting to me.  Like in "Real Women Have Curves."  That is a really good movie, and the relationship between the girl and her mother does not seem fake at all to me.  I'm struggling with that bit.  In the case of my short story, although the character shares many of my experiences, she has different relationships with friends and family than I have, so I cannot write that part from experience so much.  One thing is for sure--I will not have it finished totally by tomorrow.  My peers will just have to deal with editing only part of the story.  I hope I can fit this thing into less than 15 pages.  I wish I had recorded that dream after I had it. I think I will watch a movie tonight.  I probably shouldn't, but I really feel like it right now.  My mother is going to my cousin's dance recital.  I told her I had too much homework to do, which is kind of true.  I think I'm going to get that movie started now so that it won't finish too late.
