On the sample reel there's an example of this technology in use, as a holographic model dresses and undresses in a Copenhagen shop window. Gawkers abound, as you can imagine.   urlLink AdRants  imagines that these holographic models could be used to accost customers walking down the street. I'd like that because I wouldn't feel guilty about glaring at them and walking the other way. In any case, even these glowing ghost-like images are less creepy than those  urlLink living mannequins .
