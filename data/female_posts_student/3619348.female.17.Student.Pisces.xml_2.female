I must say though, during the fireworks I really wanted some sweet guy that I could just lean over and plant a soft little kiss on his cheek.  But I was sitting next to Emily and Erik.  No such luck.  *smacks head*  Ah, well.  I got to see Brandon Emerick and his flavor of the week snuggle right in front of me, yeah.  Heh.  hes beautiful, but has never even said 'hey' to me, nor do I think he knoiws I am alive...but eh.  He truly is a jerk, I just am attracted to him.  Whatever.
