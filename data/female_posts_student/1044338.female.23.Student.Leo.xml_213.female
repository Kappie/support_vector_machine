Adam had a BBQ at his parent's place, then we headed to the Thirsty Turtle on Whyte Ave. It was a pretty great night, aside from the part where I had to babysit a drunk, rowdy Dan! Adam, I am surprised that you didn't get extremely hammered and pass out on the hood of a camaro, like you did on a previous birthday. ;o)
