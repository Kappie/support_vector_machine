My Dying Goodbye  I'm sorry if I hurt you I'm sorry I make you cry my time has come for me to leave so this is my goodbye. I know I made you angry and I know I made you mad but now I'm gone I'd hate to leave You always looking sad. I never really got to say how much you mean to me you really were amazing parents the best they'll ever be. I love you both with all my heart I'm too young to have to go But with my depart they'll always be the love i didnt always show.  I'm sorry that i have to go I'm sorry I'm leaving this way I'm sorry i won't appear at the door smiling and saying 'hay'. I'll miss how safe you made me feel and you always being there without you I feel lost and weak cause' I'm alone and feeling scared. I love you more than the world itself and I'll miss you more everyday I wish I could have more time to care I wish that I could stay. Cause now I'm starting to get scared what am I going to do? I'm going to a place far far away I dont want to be without you! But i will be brave, i will be strong cause' my future wasnt ment to be whenever you feel sad and alone you can always talk to me.  Mum and dad i love you I'll watch over you every day I'll keep you safe and happy and be listening to what you say. I'm sorry i never listened before I'm sorry i dissobayed i never did anything when you said It always had to be my way. But this isnt the way i want I dont like saying goodbye this is the hardest one I've had to do Because today I'm going to die. So with this my feelings i hope you know you know I'd never lie I'll never forget you, I love you so much But this is my dying goodbye.     see its rather sketchy, but the fact i wasnt consious at the time makes it abt more impressive...and the fact i ment and meanit all!  i then died..which obviously was inevitable! the feeling of dying wasnt actually there tho- i didnt feel myself go, it kinda skipped to when i was dead and going to tell my loved ones (not me myself obviously!)  so it was mum, she was in the car n picked up chloe from blatch- insisted she had to be here coz it was important- none off them even knew i was in an accedent. so they went to the sports cafe, it was buzzin and loud as usual!  when mum walked up to our group they all kinda went sillent and still when they saw mums red, puffy tear stained eyes, but people who wernt with us didnt so were still rly loud, so kim randomly jummped up and screamed 'shut up everyone!' coz they couldnt rly hear mum tlk! very unkim-like...but it could happen! mum then told them briefly what happened, quickly gave them the letter and hurried off in tears. kim, mais and clo then read the letter as everyone listened shocked into silence.  pete wasnt there tho. i think it was a late start for him or something, so when he walked into the s.cafe late it was full of sympethetic eyes stairing at him, expecting him to have already known. it was horrible. then i woke up in tears!my pillows were absolutly drenched, because as i was writting the letters and poem in my dream i was crying....but i was actually crying in reality as well! very very strange! it was soo soo unbelievabley real! i couldnt stop crying when i woke up!i was totally spun out! it was that real!    urlLink    Family is so important to me   Vx
