And Just when I thought time had set me free,      Those thoughts of you keep taunting me     Holding you.... a feeling I never outgrew   Though each and part of me has tried, only you can fill that space inside.    So there's no sense pretending, my heart... its not mending      Just when I thought I was over you,    And just when I thought I could stand on my own    Oh Baby, those memories come crashing through.   And I just can't, go on without..... you.       On my own I've tried to make the best of it alone   I've done everything to ease the pain, but only you can stop the rain.    I just can't live without you... I miss everything about you..       Just when I thought I was over you, And just when I thought I could stand on my own Oh Baby, those memories come crashing through. And I just can't, go on without..... you.       That song describes EVERYTHING I'm feeling right now, I'm confused and I feel stupid feeling things I shouldn't even be feeling. What's worse is that the one person I want to inform of this, can't know or maybe doesn't want to know. I don't know how to keep my pride intact anymore, at times it seems really important, and then again there would be those days when I just don't care. When I'm reminded of all the wrongs that's been done, I feel this surge of anger, but that just goes away when I think of the person that I KNEW. Its funny that I don't even care about all the fights, all the anger, all the "bad", all I care about is the TIMES we shared together. All the bad things that happened suddenly seem so petty. Sometimes, I wish I can just say what I feel and not have to feel bad or have to keep my pride!! But would anyone CARE? Would it make a difference? Will it turn back the hands of time? Will it bring anyone back in my life? No one, NO, NO and NO are the answers to those questions that I keep telling myself. If only that was enough to get rid of this loneliness taking over my being. Shit!Shit!Shit!DAMN!
