Every Saturday at four Death comes knocking at my door. I then invite him in for tea And tell him of my misery. I'm glad to see him here again Though others would not let him in. If only he would always stay; I miss him much when he's away. When five o'clock comes rushing in He must go away again. "Do take me along!" I moan. But always does he leave alone. I ask him why I cannot go, Escape at last this wretched woe. But smiles, he does, and says to me That Life would miss my company. I scold him well for teasing so. It is not true, I surely know. For I am minor, nothing true. A better's loss, perhaps she'd rue. I tell him he's a wicked foe To not take those who want to go. For they can only sit and wait For Death will come, though far too late. Instead he always compensates With other deaths and crueller fates, Taking those whou wish that they Could maybe live another day. Stealing those who might be missed, Those whose lips have not been kissed, Those who matter rather more With something still worth living for. But Death says he must go away He shall be late if he delays. I bid him gone, go where he may For he'll be back next Saturday. But I see something in his eye: A tear rests there, waiting to cry. I kiss his weary, tender cheek And he goes until next week. I know now why Death waits for me. He won't let go, he cares deeply. I'm different: I don't fear his song Most mourn his arrival; I mourn him gone.  As I said, rather strange.
