My feet are still aching due to that loooonngg walkin   Recto    I never knew lookin for f*uckin second hand books sucks,  BUT  entertaining ! It's like you give them the title of the book you're lookin for, they look at it closely, you feel that they have the book and the agony of walking again is about to end, BUT NO! They'll just give it back and say that they don't have it! gggrrrr! It's also entertaining coz i kept on wondering (and i still am) how they know they don't have that book when they don't even scan what they have! Did they memorize all the titles of what thet were selling?!?  Whatever...  Anyways i should start on as to how me and Rosel met up.  We were talking on the phone then she said she's going to Quiapo and me the ever kitikite would like to go out and asked if i could come. And we decided to meet up!  I was already at Quiapo at around 1:30 pm. I have no idea how to contact her coz of her newly-bought-but-already-sira cellphone. Pare wala syang signal! So i was wandering around Quiapo for 30 minutes! May lumalapit na sakin "Ate bili kang sampaguita?" haayy... as much as i wanted to buy from that lil kid i couldn't all i had was   P40!   How the hell was i suppose to buy from her kung pamasahe ko pa lang kulang na?!?!?  Good thing i brought my Nokia 3210™. I had no guts to bring out my Nokia3650™ (AND I HAVE NO INTENTIONS OF DOING THAT!) kahit na nga 3210 na lang ginagamit ko pumapasok pa rin ako dun sa loob nung "mall" nakakatakot no! Parang andaming mandurukot! I kept on calling   Raymond *  asking what time she went out, what she was wearing etc. Buti na lang may load din yung Smart™ sim ko anak ng putakte. FINALLY!!!! i contacted her! She asked me to wait at the Mercury Drugstore there.     AND LOOK WHAT ENTERTAINED ME WHILE WAITING!!!!    Maid in Manhattans having an EB! I can't picture the look on the girl's face. Either she's just   shy   or   nadidismaya   sya. (i am guessing its the   later  . hehe =þ) The guy looked like a   kargador   at greenhills. (im soooo sorry for being a laitera,its just part of what i really am..)  Anyways they decided to leave just in time, Rosa Isabel came!  (Haaayy..sa wakas..)  HaHaHa  We went to   TUP   to look for her mom. Kukunin kasi namin yung perang pambili ng libro nya. E paalis yung mama nya,so we went to SM Manila muna.   (im tired and im not in the mood to tell what happened..maybe next time..or look at Rosel's blog if she wrote it there na.)  Basta pinuntahan kami ni Jeff dun sa 7-11 sa Morayta. Nakita kami. Umuwi na ko.  OK  On the ride home may nakasabay akong mga jologs.    WHY JOLOGS?!?    I know..I know masamng manglait..pero totoo naman e.  There were 8 of them. 6 guys 2 girls.  Nakakairita sila.  Let's start with the two girls:  One looked really trying hard to be pretty, but she isn't. She's just payat. Gawd!   WALA NGA SYANG @ NGIPIN SA HARAP E!   Nakakahiya! Ang daldal pa naman nya! She was arguing with her boyfriend. According to her may invisible barrie daw sa gitna nila. WHATEVER!  The other girl was malandi. She was hitting on the guy,who looked 25+ years old (i suppose they're 17-19 years of age.),beside her. She wasn't doing a very good job.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY HAD TO BRING A ROLL OF TOILET PAPER! (WALA BA SILANG PANYO?!?!)  ok dun naman tayo sa lalake.  Namention ko na yung 2  yung 4 pa..  i have nothing againts the two guys at my right side.they were tahimik.  PERO YUNG NASA KALIWA KO ANG EPAL!  Trying-hard Wannabe-Rappers! (oohhh..Jam* Hates guys like these! haha =þ)  What's more irritating is that may sumakay sa 2 matanda..An old lady sat between the two girls. Still nagaaway pa din si feeling-pretty girl and her gwapo-wannabe boyfriend. Finuck-you yung girl nung guy, and of course magrereact sya    KNOW WHAT THE REACTION WAS?!?      "TANGINA WAG M KONG GANYANIN HA!"    Sobrang nakakahiya sila..haayyy..ako yung nahihiya para sa kanila e..T_T    NIKEI's MOOD FOR THIS DAY:  HAPPY!  kase..basta! hahaha    *: Jeff=Rosel's boyfriend Raymond=Rose's bro Jam=Jrock from friendster!ü
