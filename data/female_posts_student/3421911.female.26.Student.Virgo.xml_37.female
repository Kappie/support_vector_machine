Well, I’m slowly making peace with every living human being I’ve hurt in this lifetime (loading up on good karma before the bar exams) and tell you what, the feeling is actually exhilarating. It’s like a load has been lifted from my chest and I’ve been carrying it for so long. I actually thought she’s in connivance with my ex of three years to make my life miserable. It turns out she’s not and we’re really good friends right now and I love it. Our closeness makes the ex of three years crazy. Talk about paranoia.    Point of information:  Before my ex of three years, I went out with this lesbian but we only went out for two months because I was such a slut then and I take full responsibility for everything. But I just have to say that I don’t seduce people who don’t want to be seduced. Let me just say that :)   Anyway, people are speculating that we’re together because we are always together and she kinda lives in my ex’s house because they’re best friends (told you I was/is a slut hehehe) so people aren’t speculating in a good way. And I just so want to say: it’s not,”are they together?” It’s, “ARE THEY TOGETHER AGAIN?”     N.B. Don’t tell my ex-girlfriend’s new girlfriend I said that :)
