Today was a good sermon. It was a bit strong, you know, on the matters of sexual purity and immorality. But it was really good.    My sister thinks Dean is a weird guy who laughs at everything. He is weird, but in a good way. I mean, I can talk too much and he won't stop me. Hehe...maybe I do talk too much. XD    I just started downloading a bunch of new songs from church, like "Draw Me Close" and "Refiner's Fire."    Now for more Web-surfing!
