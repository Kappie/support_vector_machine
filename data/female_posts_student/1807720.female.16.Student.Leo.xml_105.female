I worked through like a million problems with the resource room lady and like went over my finance test with my math teacher.  Looks like practicing for that math test paid off.  I got a 71%!!!  YAY!  That was my goal, just score over 70%.  Last night all I could think about was  YES, I DID GOOD ON MATH , and when I woke up this morning all I could think of was: 71...71...71...I GOT a 71% in math!!!!!  Although I wish I could of done a little better on the Chem final I was looking at my marks and she changed one of my labs that I failed to 100% and it said:  Mark changed to reflect the participation in Bonus Lab.  I just hope my Chem average will be over 70%.  I sure hope.  I know I deserve it.  After the math final yesterday Megan, Erin, and Myself went to Moxie's for lunch and then after Erin left we shared one of those white chocolate brownie desserts: It was after final reward.  LOL.  And then we had to go back to the school so Megz could finish a social test she didn't write, and then we went back to my house.  We both choose our monologues for our audtions for the play and we are soooooo excited for Drama.  Can't wait!  Then my mom made us dinner but we were so full from lunch that we barely ate but by midnight we were pretty hungry but just waited til' the morning to eat breakfast.  And we rented a Midsummer Nights Dream so we watched that, then we watched legally blonde, and on TV we watched Charmed, Jaon of Arcadia, and Third Watch, and then half of My Big Fat Greek Wedding until we we so tired that our eyes hurt from keeping them open for so long.  I had such a fun time.  I didn't sleep much last night for some reason.  It might take a couple days for the stress I have built up over the past week to wear off.  Either it's the stress or maybe it's cause I kept thinking about math last night.  I still can't figure out how I did better on the math, than the Chem.  I thought the long answer on the math final was soooo easy but like the M.C. part was challenging.  And like on the long answer there was this question that I didn't understand at first and I just remembered what she said:  If you get to a question you don't know then skip it and do it last.  When I skipped the question I didn't understand, I didn't loose my confidence through the test.  So this question was stuff during the year I really struggled with, but when I went back I just said to myself: Ok Vanessa you can do this.  I just sat there and I did the question right!!!!  Since it was like you have to set up two equations, and then solve for like what x or y represented I just plugged the values I got for x and y back into one of my two formulas and it gave me what it was suppose to equal.  I am so proud of myself, because all year I struggled with doing those kind of questions, and finally I got it right.      Life's Tug Of War  Life can seem ungrateful and not always kind. Life can pull at your heartstrings and play with your mind. Life can be blissful and happy and free. Life can put beauty in the things that you see. Life can place challenges right at your feet. Life can make good of the hardships that we meet. Life can overwhelm you and make your head spin. Life can reward those determined to win. Life can be hurtful and not always fair. Life can surround you with people who care. Life clearly does offer its ups and its downs. Life's days can bring you both smiles and frowns. Life teaches us to take the good with the bad. Life is a mixture of happy and sad.  So...  Take the life that you have and give it your best. Think positive, be happy let God do the rest. Take the challenges that life has laid at your feet. Take pride and be thankful for each one you meet. To yourself give forgiveness if you stumble and fall. Take each day that is dealt you and give it your all. Take the love that you're given and return it with care. Have faith that when needed it will always be there. Take time to find the beauty in the things that you see. Take life's simple pleasures let them set your heart free. The idea here is simply to even the score.
