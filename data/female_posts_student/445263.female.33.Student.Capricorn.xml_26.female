Well, it's almost finished, and a member of the  urlLink  UK Yahoo BookCrossing Group  has very kindly put it online for me. It's quite a big download - 7.5MB or 14MB depending on which quality you choose - but I'd love to hear what you think of it!   urlLink BookCrossing Documentary   Oh, BTW, if you decide to join as a result of listening, can you stick chelseagirl or hey-miki down as your referrers! Thank you!
