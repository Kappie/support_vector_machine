I'm the one who gets worried when I see the expression on her face when I play my exam pieces. I know what she means when she says "theres not feeling la, the magic hasn't happene" But HOW? The feeling doesn't seem to want to come out, if that is possible. I guess its the 'mood' thing again. I've been bad, mood-wise. But hey, I've been practicing this piece for months, surely I can at least play with some feel for it.   To tell you the truth, I actually LIKE my pieces this time 'round. They're sad, wallowing-in-depression kinda pieces. Lyadov's Mazurka in F minor has a tragic sound to it, which makes it lovely and this delicate nimble middle sect. I love the piece. Needs more "feeling" too, though.   Oh, and the 3rd piece. Its the best in the world. Makes you wanna move your body to da groove while playing it. Heh heh heh. Its a blues piece. And a very bluesy piece it is. By Christopher Lambert. 4 pages though, but I love every note of it. Thought it doesn't sound too well when I play, but I still like it very much (not my playing but the piece)   I'm bored, gotta do my maths homework. My face is FULL of pimples. Nasty ones. It hurts la. Sigh.   I think I talk too much.   I shocked that my friend uses such profane language in her blog entries.   -M-R
