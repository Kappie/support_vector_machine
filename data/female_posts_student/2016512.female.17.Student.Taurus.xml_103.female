Nothing to spendy or anything. I continued packing and have decided that my duffle is a jerk and we are no longer on speaking terms. so, i'm giving up for now because i just have stuff upon stuff. i'm not used to actual long trips. my fam doesn't take many trips other than for the weekend.  so once i conquer my duffle i'll be on my way to GS tomorrow. i'm trying to go with an open mind, but i don't really want to go. i'm not that interested in politics, but maybe it will be eye opening and insightful...maybe not. well it doesn't matter i guess. i'm going. but i always have Les Miserable to look forward to on Sunday. sure why not.
