Well, all the peeps (YUM! Marshmallow..I love peeeps!) did an awesome job but I didn't get to hang out with Mr. Hotness at all! (Now refered to as "Elvis") I looked for him after the show, but he was no where to be found. We went to an after show party. It was GREAT fun! But we left way to stinkin' early. The dancing didn't even start. *sigh*  Mr. Hotness showed up in an Elvis costume. It was SO funny! Gosh, he rocks.  I just want to make something clear, he is not as hot and Sunshine. BUUUUTTT!!! HE SINGS AND LOOOVES TO PLAY THE GEE-TAR! Hhahahah. I htink next time I see him I will have to ask him what kind of guitar he plays. He wants to be a worship pastor. I could go for that. ;)  Gosh, I am a freak.  Laura is very tired and must get her beauty sleep. 11 MORE SHOWS!!!  22 HOURS OF STARING AT HIS FACE! Cha ching.   Happiness.  I don't like him.  I really don't.
