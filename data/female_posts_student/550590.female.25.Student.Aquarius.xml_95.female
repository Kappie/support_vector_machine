I would have been a lot more sad were I able to feel anything except really really hyper.  I'm having Shawn and David and Rebecca over for Manacotti tonight so it's back into the kitchen for me.  Then it's off to Jason's for a kick ass party and lots and lots of debauchery.  Graduation is so much more to celebrate when you don't have to sit through the ceremony!
