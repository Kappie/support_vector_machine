In fact, I have had to take any available time (excpet now cause I am tired and just need to unleash) just to do school work.  I am trying really hard to keep up with the English but right now he expects way too much.  I can't keep up with it all, but I am trying.  On Sunday I will have to do an indepth review of my Bio, though we are doing a J.H. performance of the play during tutorial so I will probably have to write it Tuesday.  I think I am going to ask if I can write it 1st thing in the morning, like after 7.  There would be less distractions, I wouldn't feel time pressure, and if I am in a room by myself (hopefully) then I would feel less anxiety and more relaxed.  Drama festival was fun.  Too much food, and well I have had to leave early alot for play rehearsal (which I am sick of)  And well Wednesday I did Commedia, yesterday I did "Unwrapping the Classics" so basically breaking down Shakesphere, and today I did Musical Theatre - which was the most fun of all, and we even got to sing Jesus Christ Superstar with a dance we learned.  It was sooo much fun!!  Like I said though too much food - today alone I've have p.b.  J sandwich, granola bar, muffin loaf thing, cookie, milk, chinese, pizza, ice cream cone, strawberries and cool whip.  I gained like 3 pounds from yesterday but I look the same, or atleast still feel like me.  Ok I can't write anymore, too stressed and I am talking to Brent on Msn and tommorow I have early morning rehearsal.  Rehearsal again, go figure.  I am really tired of it, but it will pay off.  It's just really hard to have a life.  My life seems to revolve around Drama more than anything else.
