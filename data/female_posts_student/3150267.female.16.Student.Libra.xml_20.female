God only help those who help himself...  i noe tt n i should help myself. i will be strong to my faith n try not to be very in tacked to my frenz moods. i will learn from each mistake i make n stand strong to prove tt my life is worth living for... i promise myself this tt i'll try...    but will u?      ~In Life, it doesn't matter who you are, but whether someone appreciates you for what you are, accepts you and loves you unconditionally. A Real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks away.~    ::Obstacles can't stop you. Problems can't stop you. Most of all other people can't stop you. Only you can stop you... let us not be a burden to ourselves n always be persistant...::   p/s: i want to take this chance to encourage n apologize to someone who has a very special place in my heart. i m sori tt i can't do anything to help n sometimes i juz make a mess out of it. really veri sori. plz stay strong n have faith. everything will soon be over n there'll always be sun after a storm. ^_^ even though i have sad moments too, but i try my best to overcome it. so muz u!
