But when something like September 11th or the Columbia tradgey occurs I tend to read the Daily Express, Telegraph etc.. I also keep the papers for that day. I have about a bzillion from September 11th, ranging from the actual day to about a week after, including an OK! magazine. I also figured that when I'm like 70 or someting (if I live that long) my kids / grandkids may be taught about it and I can say 'weel lookie here kiddo'.
