I have the feeling that if I make it, it's going to be a terribly silly affair, not at all what Lydia's used to doing, but hey, it's worth a try, isn't it?  You know, I'm still fundamentally me. I was checking grades on Edline and I realized that I didn't get credit for some assignments, etc., and that set me in a panic even though my grade isn't in jeopardy at the moment. I don't know how I've become so anal about some things, but in a way it's a kind of a safeguard--it'll be useful come college, when I'm sure getting A's will be much more of a struggle.  *Dad said I could go to Harvard over the summer today!* I still feel bad, though. It's $7,600 not including airfare, and there are some college summer programs out there that aren't as expensive, but then again they don't happen to offer as many courses. Ideally, I'd like to take a psych course and their Creative Nonfiction, since I'm still stuck on "Best American Essays." In my dreams, some Harvard prof discovers my writing and I become famous, except that's ARROGANCE again and I know it won't happen.  Went to the Colburn seminar today. Turns out that I got the middle seat in the front row and I had to turn pages, except there was this Brahms trio with two editions. The group played the revised, I was looking at the original, and freaking out because it was usually S. or C. who turned pages and they were good pianists, and I thought my not being able to find the notes reflected poorly on my piano playing ability. E. was sitting next to me and I thought, ok, he's good too so maybe he'll keep an eye out for me. In the middle of the trio, I was so lost and so embarrassed.  Besides that, the two trios that played were so beautiful. The first one you could expect excellence, I guess, since the kids looked pretty mature about things. The second was a group of younger kids, but they played with equal spirit and ability. What a difference vibrato makes! I think one of these days I'll go through our Brahms and do the violin part instead and see if I can get the same effect, since it doesn't sound like it usually. Cello and violin playing together was so pretty, plus the melody...it was a very uplifting experience (if only I knew which edition we were using).   The two trios today really made me want to go back to our Brahms and see if we could touch up on it and make that lovely vibrato sound, but then I think back and realize that I don't have the other two anymore. In fact, it's not even my music, so I should probably return it to R.  And every time I go, I realize I could be so much better if I practiced. The difference today was that I realized that it applied to both piano and violin. I wonder how much time those people must spend sitting at the bench or standing with a violin under their chin. Stamina is one thing I lack. I can't even run a mile, which is pathetic when J tells you that she woke up at 4 that morning to do a few miles. I can't practice piano diligently, and especially not now because it's finals weekend. I am not a very good self-motivator.  It's so funny how C and W are so into who's pretty/hot and who's not. I feel like such an outsider sitting in the car when they're talking about these things, which makes me believe that something's seriously wrong with the way I'm wired. Or maybe...well, it just seems so isolationist and cold of me not to say anything when they do, but then again that's my character. How do I reconcile the two?
