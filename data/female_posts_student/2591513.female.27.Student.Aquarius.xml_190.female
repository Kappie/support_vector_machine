I didn't take that route back because seriously it was like Tahoe and well I have a tendency to get car sick and well that wouldn't be a good idea.  WE hung out for awhile and just talked, me him and pa.  It was funny because we all decided that as much as we love my cousin Alisson, she was a holy terror and a half.  I mean hello.  My aunt and uncle do not know how to keep their kids in line.    Okay for example, they let their daughter wander around the house with no diaper so Ed catches her peeing all ove rour carpet...GROSS  And of course, they laugh and say, "Alisson, that's not good."  Everytme she does something that is all she gets, that sentence and then a laugh...it is no wonder she doesn't listen.  Then she had a bowl of watermelon and just threw it on the floor and splattered the juice everywhere...and yes my aunt and uncle giggled and gave her that sentence...UGH  I love kids, but come on, you want them to listen to them, let them know that they do something wrong by showing a little bit more authority and not laughing at everything.  I feel bad because she is my god-daughter...well Ed's, but mine by marriage of course...but she is so bad.  She just turned two this weekend.  I feel so awful as I type this, but damn...the girl really gets away with a lot.  Anyhow that was our weekend.  Here goes 20+ days of me rambling about missing Ed.  I am sorry if I end up whining but I really do feel incomplete when he is gone...not in a bad way, just that my other half is missing.  I know this training is needed though in order for him to be "safe" in Iraq.  Have a very good week everyone.  I hope that you all will have a productive week.  We are going to TRY to make it to Disneyland.
