So this morning, I decided to wear flip-flops because they always put me in a good mood. For some reason, whenever I wear them I feel better about myself.  So the day started out wonderfully.  Then, because I have nothing to think about during the school hours, I began to think about how I hardly ever talk to any of my friends anymore. The only time we actually talk is during lunch. It's really depressing. :\  ..Bah.  Today, at the graded  performance, all went well except that CJ, the dumb-ass running the lights, kept fooking up his cues... Bah.  But, as for us actors, we all did great.  I can't wait for the show tomorrow.  ..Bah, But I did have to wear make-up, as all actors do. (I  never  wear make-up..) People said it looked really good on me and "brought out my pupils". (Thanks, Aaron!) I think it made me look like a cheap whore though... ..Maybe someday I'll give into the evils of make-up... maybe..   I got home checked an email, and found out that I am now a Goddess on  TEOTI . Wheeeeee!  I've known since the 10th that I was going to become one, but I actaully am one now! Yay!  (Mad props for REALITY...)  I think there was more that I wanted to say... but I forgot... :   Conversation snippet of the day:  Jordan- "I'm going to throttle your brains out!" me- "Wow, that sounds dirty..."
