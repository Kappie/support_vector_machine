I walked down stairs and ate some halloween candy. Yumm!  Then I watched Regis and Kathy Lee. Oh wait! Its not Kathy Lee any more...what is that persons name??? Ooooh yeah! Kelly Rippa.  But instead of Regis is was Pat Sajak, from wheoe o' fortune. YAY! He rocks!! They had that guy from the O.C. that Meagan G. is obbsessed with. Haha. He is one ugly dukling. ;) Acctually, he wasn't that bad. But any ways....Then I  had a piece of nasty pizza and we had to clean. My dad THREATENED my brother. It was GREAT! My brother is super scary so my dad told him that if he said or did anything mean to ME he would be in HUGGGGGE trouble. It was great. Then my brother goes "I never do anything to HER, she is the mean one!!" Riiiighhht.  I laughed.  So we cleaned.  I made him clean our WINDOWS! hahhaha! Its the worst job on the planet because our house is infested by bugs so there are about 20 dead bugs in each window sill. Its pretty sick. So I got my mom to make him clean the windows. HAHHAHA! He was SOOO stinking mad! It was great.  Then....we said he was going to CLEAN THE SHOWER BUUUUUUUTTTTT he was acctually in his ROOM! For a half an hour while I was slaving away! I was SUPER SUPER MAD. SO I told me mom abotu all his lies and deciet and she threatened to fire ME! Poor little me! Who would want to fire ME? :D I am the GOOD one. So I almost told her about  how I caught my brother skipping class and how he ate a bag of the candy we are supposed to save for trick-or-treaters but I was to scared of what my brother would do to me. YIKES!  Now I am "home alone" but there are 5 guys here. Haha. Olive, 3 construction workers, and the tree removing guy who is off somewhere grinding stumps. Its a little scary. I hope our hosue gets finished SOON! I don't think I can last any longer!    My parents are going out to eat tonight and so I has to be alone with my brother. YIIIIIKKKEs! Good thing I didn't tell my mom everything he did or else he woulld probably beat me up. Yikes. I am afraid to live in this hosue with him...   I better go!  Adios lovely amigos!
