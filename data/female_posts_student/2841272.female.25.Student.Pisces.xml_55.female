Shaolin , a zany martial arts/soccer hybrid, has nothing to say but is a fun, frothy burst of absurdist imagination.  Super Size , which follows a month long all-McDonalds diet, broaches the serious topic of obesity with a thoughtful, light touch. The film raises more questions than answers, and those it supplies are a bit weak, but both  Super Size  and  Shaolin  offer a change from the typical, mindless summer fare.
