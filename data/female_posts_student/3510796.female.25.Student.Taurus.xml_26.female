Grace is Gone and Grey Street.  The jam for GIG was freakin' awesome!  I could not stop dancing the entire time.  Little disappointed in all the 'radio songs' like So Much To Say and Where Are You Going.  And I think they could have done better with the encore instead of What Would You Say.  Coming back with Crush and Stefan-the bass God that he is- oh, perfect end to a perfect show.  If I Had It All, song off of Everyday, not that impressed, and a little slow.  The jams and dancing is what gets me going and when a slow song comes on, its just like WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?!?  How can you go from Too Much into IIHIA and then play Rhyme  Reason?  They did it though.  Shouldnt really complain, I was just happy to be there and have another great time on the lawn.  Besides the 17 year old boy and his girlfriend who got taken away by ATF and the 21 year old girls next to us for buying alcohol for minors and the guy behind us who threw up on our blanket AND the girl who pissed behind us, Tweeter rocked.  Dave's Skat was memorable and everytime the camera panned over Carter, he had a huge grin on his face.  Maybe they were talking about someone in the crowd or maybe he knew he was part of the best damn band in the world and that set him in a good mood.  New songs were tight,  Crazy, Easy  and Joy Ride ,were two of my faves.  Getting the new cd will be something I'll be waiting for.  Well I need to go post on Nancies that I need to do a B for last nights show.   Peace. Love.DMB.    |360 some odd days till next summers show.|    Holla.
