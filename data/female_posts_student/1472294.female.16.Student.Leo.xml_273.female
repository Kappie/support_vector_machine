And of course, it is newer than FF 11 and better image quality and very, very detailed structures of 'buildings' and airships. I like it, this time, not focusing or drooling over the characters, but the structures of airships and the view. Though I must say the characters are certainly cooler and nicer- looking. But no cute, cute characters. Just more skin are exposed and more realistic features. Too bad, it is going to be released only next year, 2005. Hmmm... Just a thought though.
