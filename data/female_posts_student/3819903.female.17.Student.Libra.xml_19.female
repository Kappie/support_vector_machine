So we jetted off to Pick n' Save to pick up our favorite munchies, and i left to go to the grams to start setting up, and she went home to get the kids, I proceeded to then hop on the freeway.  Lets just say I put the car in Park in a 65 mph zone!!  I was sooo dumb!  DUH..President Bush was in town today, and the next exit on the freeway was blocked and guarded, because thats where the building was!!  'Smack me, i'm gonna be late to my own party!'  I parked to car, Cranked the music and sat there in an utter state of confusion as I wondered, why the fuck the interstate was in sheer gridlock...in Waukesha!?    Arrived in Elm Grove, at 10:54; i was 12 miles away, and it took me 56 minutes to get there!  GAY!  Set up the pool, got all the soda in the coolers, and pumped the jams.  And the first to arrived was Nicole around 11:30.  Shortly followed by many more of my fellow commerads!  And we partied it up in the poolio for a good while...got burned, and had raft races--made me feel like i was 6 again!  Surprisingly enough, the diving board was used ONCE!  by me!  Weird!?  Sarah--Fair skinned, orange haired Sarah--put on tanning oil!  hmm...shes a quick one!  She's really asking for melanoma early!  Lets just say, she had the most "defined" tan lines out of all of us!  I got burnt...slightly...just my cheeks really, otherwise, the pinkish tone on my bod should be gone by sunrise.  And right as we were packing up to leave, Adam Ludwig showed up, and he was like, "I'm sooo sorry, i tried as hard as i could to get out of work and get over here!"  so we talked a while, then raced home!! Not the greatest idea, when there's traffic...i dont advise!  During her stay at the humble aboad of the grandparentals, Nicole said that her bro had a basketball game around 7, and Ricciardi would be there!  WHAT???    RICCIARDI!?   "umm...is it ok, if Meyer, Amanda, and I come and watch "your brother?"  Or see Ricciardi really!!  Man it was blast just seeing him!  I told him that I was an official Psych major, and he said he was really proud of me, and that I will love it!  So we chatted it up with the "happily married man with kids", as my friends would say, for a while, and then we waved goodbye to sit down and watch the game.  But as i waved, ricciardi gave me the "come hither" finger motion, and said to me..."I have something to give you before you go to college, you'll like it, just make sure you dont leave for Edgewood without seeing me first!  It was great seeing you, haven't seen ya in a while!" in my head i'm thinking..."ahhhhhh i get to see him again!!!!!!!!!!!!"---not enough room for the necessary exclamation points!  So, then as i got up after the game to see him before i left, to arrange a time and place to recieve this unknown gift, he was gone!!  So, im making plans to go back next Wednesday to see him and talk!  haha  wow!  That was the highlight of the day...no the week, or month actually!  hahahahaha  After my knee-buckling confrontation with a man I adore for his personality and his love for people, Amanda and I headed off to our co-ed softball game!  We play with 29 year olds...and we're the youngest!  haha, so we played our game, and kicked arse!  Then we normally stay around and chat it up with the teammates.  So amanda and i always seem to talk to Todd.. who i think is the most attractive atually, and the best player on the team!  So we talked for a while, and made fun of eachothers problems in the outfield tonight, and we found out some interesting information about him!  He was a '95 graduate of Waukesha North!! No freakin' way!?  I thought that was sooo cool!  anyways...!  I've gushed about numerous men tonight!  Well, they were all fun stories actually!  Time to go to bed, definitley was a better day than last!  NO drama!  haha
