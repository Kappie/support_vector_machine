I sorta kinda fucked up my dad's computer for a while, but i fixed it. i had 2 find him some riddles for his newsletter. when i get home im going to ask my mom to take me to the store so i can buy the sims. i'm also supposed to send stacia a copy of Donnie Dark-o.. she says its a great movie but i've never watched it although its been in my living room forever.. maybe i'll give a try. i really need to get started on my summer assignments.... beezlebub give me strength.
