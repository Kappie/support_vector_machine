This guy invited Mike and I to his birthday party. Come to find out, Mike's ex-girlfriend is gonna be there. Kinda awkward, but it should be fine. It's not like we've never hung out with her before. We're married anyways, so what. But, I do have to say, it must be bothering me somewhat, seeing that I am writing about it. Whatever....  Man, I have to clean the house today, it's getting kinda dirty. I feel like I clean the house every freakin' day. I didn't say that I did. I said it just FELT like it....   I don't know why, But, I HATE doing laundry. I wish Grace was here, because she LOVESSS doing laundry. (Something about the smell) What a freak!! That's right Grace, your a freak!  Glenn just called and told me that there is some major drama going on in the office. So apparently Janelle and the other two new workers all quit. So who does that leave Doctor with, NOBODY!! Had Doctor treated everyone better when they were there he wouldn't be in this predicament. No one is going to help him out in this situation; Not Jaime, Glenn, Kristy nor I. I can't stand the man. He reminds me of another Hui, so conniving, and always lying. Thinking about it now, I can't believe how alike they are. I wonder if Jim or Doctor is gonna call me to help them out. In which case, I will say no!! He totally screwed Jaime, Kristy and I on our last pay check. Whatever, if being petty about a couple bucks makes him happy, go ahead.   Mike and I invited over some friends for dinner tomorrow. I have no idea what I'm gonna make. Hmmmmm..... I want to keep it simple. I don't know... In any case, it should be fun!
