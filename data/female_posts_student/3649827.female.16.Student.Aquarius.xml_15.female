NO. do i ever know what the fuck they are talking about? NO. please, go ahead, ask me, tasnia, are you going to even be an engineer when you are older. Motherfucking NO. and they make it sound so easy.  I'M   the one who has to make a fool of herself in front of all these ppl trying to explain the acoustic responses of nanophased epoxy fucking resin.   why didn't i just quit when i had the chance?   (did i ever?)   and now i've only got 2 weeks left...less than that. i'm not going to give in now. they are holding onto money that is by all rights   MINE.   i hate it here. i hate it. i hate it. i hate. it.    and i'm mad tired.   if only i could just close my eyes, maybe this all would go away. i don't care about the damn ASTM.   i don't even know what it is. i don't care what they said. why do they want to torture me?   i won't answer any of their questions. no.   i'll just stand there. like a fucking fool.   and there is no one who could fix it.   advisor lady expects me to do all this shit myself.    yeah...no.   this isn't MY masters thesis.   I'M IN FUCKING HIGHSCHOOL.   it's 3...hopefully i'm only stuck in this hell hole for another two hours at most.   but then i get to go to blinkie's. and that will be good.   yet, that presents a whole nother hassle. getting rides. i hate it that i can't drive yet.   man. fuck.         this is so pointless.
