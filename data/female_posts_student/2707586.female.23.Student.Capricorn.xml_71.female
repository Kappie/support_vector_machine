I drove over 3100 miles in 8 days and if I don't have to go anywhere for a while its okay with me. I enjoyed the little time I spent with the fam and I did get to go to a party while I was home. Of course because its still Lent I didn't get to drink and I had to drive home a bunch of kids who weren't even legal to be drinking. Atleast I got hit on by some younger boys (I wouldn't call them men even though they were 19). All in all it was a pretty good week and I can now tell you every road you have to take to get from West Lafayette IN to Miles City MT. I didn't even use the map when I came back. I am glad to say that the weather was great and it didn't snow in Montana so HA for all of you that had snow over spring break. I never enjoy comming back to a bunch of work so I was really happy that my group had most of my project done and they don't really need my help so I just have to focus on my five million other projects.
