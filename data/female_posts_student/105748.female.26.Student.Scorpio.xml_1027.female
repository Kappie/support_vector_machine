I jokingly retorted at the idea and replied that they should act like pirates in the overnight too.  Arrgh, lassie what will you be picking up or placing an order?  Aye, there is no discount for color copies arrgh.  Yesh Maan, ju will have to walk the plank if you dont wanna pay for a cutting set up arrgh.  Then the parrot would reply: "Waaak, no discount! Waak!".  So what are you gonna be for Halloween?
