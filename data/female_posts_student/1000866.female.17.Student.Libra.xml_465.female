I love you blogspot. OK, so...I'm going to write about Chris again because he's just THAT cool. Actually..that's all I've got to say about Chris is that he's cool and he makes my days better and....he shouldn't worry because he's a really nice kid and he apologized and all was forgiven and...yes. I made up a song about him too but....yeah, sadly....this is writing and I can't sing it, not that I would in front of anyone since I can't sing. Anyway, I'm going to bed now...really...
