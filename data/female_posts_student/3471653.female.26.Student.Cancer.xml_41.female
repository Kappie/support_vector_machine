Do zoning laws (which force or encourage us to put our shopping on one side of town, business on another, ballparks off in the boonies, and houses further and further away from the center of town) make it harder for us to love our neighbors?  Strip malls and parking lots are ugly -- but are they unkind?  Eric O. Jacobsen argues that our physical space and urban planning is unloving to people who cannot drive.  The elderly who (in towns and cities) used to be able to walk down the street to visit neighbors, pick up groceries, or fill prescriptions, are now stranded in their homes, isolated from the rest of the world.  Poor people who are unable to buy or fix a car must face 8 lane highways to get to park.  Because we care so much about stable property values, we have refused to allow ballparks in our neighborhoods.  We pass ordinances to keep pharmacies and grocery stores in the business sections of town.  And meanwhile we are enslaving ourselves to fossil fuels.  How much gas, money, and foreign policy horrors could be saved by making our environment walkable?  How many more people could we love?  How would community be different?  As I try to figure out the answers to these questions, I'll be looking at     Sidewalks in the Kingdom: New Urbanism and the Christian Faith  by Eric O. Jacobsen and James Howard  urlLink Kunstler 's  City in the Mind:Notes on the Urban Condition  and  Geography of Nowhere  [though he seems a bit shrill].
