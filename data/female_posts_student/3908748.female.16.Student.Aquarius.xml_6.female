Both pictures from Alias eppy "Full Disclosure" cuz I was wondering what the ep was about (*blush* I forgot). Now, lessee...       urlLink 800x600  |  urlLink 1024x768       urlLink 800x600  |   urlLink 1024x768    Pretty eh? *smile*  Anyways, last night I had a near death experience. It felt kinda like I was dreaming that I was drowning but I could breathe. My energy was getting sapped away and my legs got heavier and heavier. Brr... very scary. Basically, it was depression pressing me down to my lowest. I even wrote a death letter, maybe I'll post it some day.  Well... cya! SKSK
