We spent the first half of the day battling the hordes at the grocery store to purchace ice, salt, and cream, then languished through the afternoon drinking beer to the soothing purr of the ice cream beaters. I whipped up some potatoes, boiled eggs, bacon, mayo and avacado into a potato salad, put the fresh corn on to boil, and my mom grilled up some steaks. Mike was especially enthused by these proceeds, as there is nothing he likes better in the world than meat, corn, and ice cream (throw in my famous potato salad and he's all smiles).  Mike ran off to work with a full belly, while Gavin and I seated ourselves on the curb outside to watch our noisy neighbors set off fireworks. Gavin was fascinated and concerned at first, but as soon as a spinning firework exploded into a shower of sparks which caused the neighbor kids (standing too close, naturally) to jump back screaming, he cried in fear and pulled me by the thumbs back indoors, shutting the door behind us. For the rest of the evening, every time he heard a crackle or bang, he scowled and pulled us away from the windows. As he nursed to sleep, he whimpered sleepily and covered his eyes at every pop. Thankfully, he is a sound sleeper, and was unperturbed for the rest of the festivities.  Mike came home at around 1am, and woke early to attend an RSCDS meeting. As he measured the cupboard doors (one of the RSCDS members is selling us wood for new cabinets) he told me about a fascinating phone call he received at the theater. An elderly woman had called to inquire about Farenheit 9-11, and had gone off on a lengthy tangent about how deeply she loathed Dubya, ending a half hour later with the announcement that all politicians are actually lizard aliens (you can tell by the way they cock their heads while they talk) and that one day they will awake in their true forms and reveal themselves to us all. At least, that's what she prays every night. Mike loves his job.
