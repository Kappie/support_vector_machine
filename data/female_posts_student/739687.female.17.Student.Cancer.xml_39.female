But that's ok, cuz doing "nothing" doesn't really bother me too much. Anyways, I was reading a bunch of random blogs and some of them were...hilarious! There were several that were even more pointless than mine...it made me feel alot better. So...if this doesn't satisfy your need to keep occupied...try reading my other blog:   urlLink It's All So Meaningless...   Well, that's all I have to say for now...have a good evening...party and be crazy...but don't forget to invite me first..;-)
