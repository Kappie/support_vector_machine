Why did Sirius have to die!?!  He was like my fave character besides Ron and of course, Harry.  Because he was freaking funny!  And of course, it didn't help that Fred and George didn't have funny comments for the last 8 chapters of the book either.  grrr, oh well, maybe Sirius will somehow return from the dead in book 6, i hope so.  Anyways, i read pretty much the whole day yesterday.  My parents and dillon went birthday party for my mom's best friend's son (who is 11 mind you) and came back completely tipsy.  I'm serious.  They came home at around 2am or so and they were like really really tipsy.  According to Dillon, all the parents ended up like that.  This kid's party was a barbeque cook out swim party thing and he's only 11 and the kids are upstairs playing video games, while the parents are downstairs "dancing" to 80's music and downing alcoholic beverages.  My dad said i should be thankful i did not have to watch my mother attempt to dance.  Lets just say that i got my famous (lol everyone who has ever seen me really dance) dancing genes from my father, because my mother can't dance to save her life.  Anyways, i don't want my mom to know that i can freak dance, it would be too much for her and she'd probably have a heart attack after giving me a lecture on the morals of dancing.  Its probably a blessing in disguise that i didn't go to this party.  So while my parents were at this wild party that my dad described as "frat party" status, me and Britt stayed online late discussing Daniel Radcliffe and comparing him to various other hott guys and we also found out that his fave video game is NHL Hockey!!!!  Its a miracle in itself that he even knows what hockey is considering that he's british, unfortunatley his fave team is the Pheonix Coyotes.  oh well.  it was fun, me and britt have alot in common with this kid.  so....probably not doing anything else today either.  Sarah leaves for NY tomorrow, it'll be sad not talking to her for a whole week.   Oh yes, and yesterday morning, i watched the NHL entry draft.  I must say that the Draft Class of '04 is loads better than past years.  The boys from the Czech Republic are alot cuter this year as well as the Finns.  Holy crap but the russians were AWFUL!!!  Alexei Ovechkin (#1 player overall) is the ugliest hockey player i have ever seen enter the NHL by far.  I mean seriously.  Can i just say that i hope the kid wasn't born like that and hockey turned him that way?  He needs plastic surgery really really bad.  But of course, the cutest boy of all, my personal favorite, was Lauri Tukanen.  Yes, you guessed it, he's finnish.  He was soooo adorable!  He doesn't have the hockey hair, but its all good, we can work on that.  He was drafted by the L.A. Kings.  Yeah so his name sounds like a girl's name, who cares he's hott.  Overall, the Class of '04 had a pretty good selection of hott guys.  I definitley nominate the Czech Republic as having the best boy selection though this year and the Russians having the absolute worst selection.    i'm out!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
