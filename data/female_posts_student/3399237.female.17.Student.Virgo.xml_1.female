The thing about old women is that they spend an unusual amount of time at bus stops. This is where the elderly gather to enjoy quality moaning time. However, i think it is unfair to classify all old people as loonies and instead the old loonies will just be the weird women with the son who eats rice (who i would like to meet) and old men who wear string vests. I mean how is a string vest supposed to keep you warm?
