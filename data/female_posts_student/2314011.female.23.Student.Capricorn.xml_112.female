YAY!!  1130-noonish is usually my start-up time, so a full hour ahead of schedule is an achievement.    Two hours later, my argument section is looking pretty spiffy and 11 pages long.  Just have to add the statement of facts and edit the whole thing down to 10 pages.  The most difficult part is over now, though.  Just have to employ those little journalistic skills:  reporting and editing.  Admittedly, this type of reporting is much more involved and entertaining because we get to tell the story from our client's perspective; we get to be as pointed, sympathetic and unforgiving as we want.  Think I'll take the Man vs The Man conflict theme to describe poor Stephen Perry's plight of being the victim of Devil Detective Danielle's vile lie about terrorists across the street when she really wanted to bust his hippie ass for pot distribution.  I'm debating whether or not to include the suspicion I have about Danielle's motives; you see, I think Stephen wooed Danielle's lesbian lover away from her and now she's exacting her revenge by overstepping her official police bounds.    Think it would start out like this:  "Danielle Washburn was a woman on the edge; a woman apart from her better judgment.  She was hurt, humiliated, humorless and looking for something or someone to hunt.  Who better than the man who ripped her very world, her reason to live and love from her and filled it with intoxicating vapor?"  Oh yea, this definitely has potential.
