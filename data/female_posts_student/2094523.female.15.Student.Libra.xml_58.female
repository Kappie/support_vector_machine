No matter what we're never free to be because we are bounded by the rule book of life. I dont know who writes it or makes it up but its just there and u gotta follow it or something bad will happen. Thats all i know.  anyways i dotn feel like talkin right now so in the mean time:    ................/´¯/)  ............../¯../ /  ............/..../ /  ....../´¯/'...'/´¯¯.`·¸  ..../'/.../..../.....:^.¨¯\  ..('(...´...´.... ¯_/'...'/  ...\.................'.....
