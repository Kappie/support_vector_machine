My IT list: the husband in Sweet Home Alabama the husband in Sweet Home Alabama the husband in Sweet Home Alabama the husband in Sweet Home Alabama the husband in Sweet Home Alabama  Gosh, I like him so much I don't even know his name!  As Ms. Morissett (sp?) would say -- isn't it ironic?  p.s. Brian and I got his and hers  MicroSizers  for Christmas!  Complete with sup-up kits!  His is a blue Nissan Skyline and mine is a white Subaru Impreza!  Pretty impressive, huh?  I was going to go get  ZipZaps , but my friend Sarah said they were crap. She has both and says that even though the MicroSizers cost more they are worth it because they're way better.  Besides the MicroSizers are available and the ZipZaps are completely out of stock.. In stock is better any day.
