My brother and sister (7 and 2) broke the tail off the school's gerbil today. Gross. I was really upset at them, I hate when people torture animals and for the past 3 days we've had it, I kept telling them to stop. Then my parents were like "No, it's OK, they're just playing" and sure enough, something bad happened. UGH. I hate not being listened to.  What else... college apps came this week. Harvard, Dartmouth, and Colgate. It's going to panic me for the rest of the summer. I have to use 5 words to describe myself on the Dartmouth app, and I think it's impossible.  I don't know what to say without sounding egotistic!
