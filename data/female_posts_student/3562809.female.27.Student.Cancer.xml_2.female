That same lovely carefree feeling that prompts one to tell perfect strangers, "I love you!" comes in handy when tossing out half the contents of one's closets.  Dresses, skirts, sweaters, happily bounce into Hefty-land, tra-la-la!  It's more difficult to remember the emotional ties to certain wardrobe pieces, so out they go!  Another side-effect of alcohol intake is the sharpened memories of ex-boyfriends.  The ghosts of men past swoop through, whispering, "ah, yes... the dress you wore on the first date with J ..."  Out, out, out it must go!   I know, once the imbibing has begun, it can be a challenge to leave the couch (and the Mad TV marathon) behind.  Efficient, useful activity is not the most appealing concept when in that happy-go-lucky state of mind.  But trust me, you will thank yourself in the morning!  Just remember, although you may load the bags destined for Goodwill into the car while you're on that nice wobbly roll, wait til you're sober to drop them off.
