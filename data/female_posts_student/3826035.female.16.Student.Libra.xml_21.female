Come to think of it, I still haven't finished the first one... perhaps I should do that. I need to write. But to write, I need a plot... at least I have characters. So far, I have Rune, Jenna, Luca, Kael and Kaeden, Emlyn, Lael, Pandora, and Radley. They just need a plot... o O.  I started one possible beginning, with Jenna being kidnapped from a field, and Luca waking up from a nightmare of her kidnapping several thousand miles away. He wakes up (in the apartment he shares with Rune), and finds everything missing except for an old looking box on the table that won't open. And... I have no idea where I'm going with it. I'm working on my Cinderella story, Afterimage, occasionally. I'm getting more and more used to writing for a character that can't speak. But soon I'm on to part two, where everything is from Seth's POV. So it will be interesting to find out how everything in his head works. Up until this point, he's just been the shy, injured, scared and paranoid little elf who relies on Prince Morgan entirely. And then they faery godmother figure, Mab, will come into the story. Oh dear. That will be something special, indeed... But enough about writing about my writing. I'm going to update my other blog now, and actually do some writing...
