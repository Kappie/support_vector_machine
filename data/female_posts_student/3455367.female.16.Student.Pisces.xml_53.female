Anywho um i think that we need to do something funn on the weekend cos we have 4 whole days ..or was it 3 ..i dont know, anyway it is still a long weekend, I feel so sick. Ooh my room looks so hellsome. Now i just need to dye my mozzie net black and buy some crimson red lace to put on my dressing table. Oh and i need some material for curtains, i think that will be crimson red aswell . And there is really no point in doing this seeing as i am moving out soon, lol Anyway it is still gonna be my room so it doesnt really matter, I think i am gonna go to bed. check
