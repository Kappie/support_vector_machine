Today is my Grandmother's birthday.  She died 3 years ago but we still remember her G-d bless her soul.  This active member is playing a new game called  urlLink DOPE WARS .  As the title says you play a drug dealer and the goal is to try to make a lot of money.  Unlike the popular game Vice City,  this game is not graphical at all.  In fact, its all TEXT.  But, if you played a lot of 'fantasy baseball' in the hey days, you can appreciate the fantasy and the anticipation in playing this game.   By the way, I still havent stopped taking over the world.  Every Monday to Friday, at 7PM, I have joined forces with  urlLink LEOVILLE  in the battle for world domination.  C'mon Pinky,  care to follow the leader?  more to come....  NET
