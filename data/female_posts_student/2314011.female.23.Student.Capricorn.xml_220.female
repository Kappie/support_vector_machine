They're big on law textbooks and "study aids".  They're the only publisher who does 1st-year-subject flashcards and those are pretty hit or miss.  Typos, answers to questions never asked in the fact-patterns and flat-out wrong black-letter law cards.  So, whenever The Stellar Super Students got hosed on an answer we KNEW was right, we took great joy in dismissing the card with the obligatory "Fuck Aspen!" attached.    So, as I found myself so close to the puppet-masters behind the travesty, I was compelled to share my frustration.  Walked in to an empty office space that closely resembled an overdone ski lodge.  High ceilings, too much decorative wood, etc.  Kinda like The Stranger's office.  Nosed around until I found three gals in tank tops, jeans and tool belts (I'm seriously, you guys) working on more decorative wood, only in here, it was 2x4s.  Knew in an instant they were all "family" and one, the leader, took my breath away the instant our eyes met.    But I would not be deterred.    I walked right into that room and declared:  "Fuck Aspen!"  No introduction; no "May I talk to your flashcard department?"; nothing.  They were a bit surprised, but let me go on.  I explained (and by 'explained', I mean 'ranted incessantly about') the problems with said flashcards while they listened attentively.  Finally, as I said my peace and made my way to leave (because really, how was I going to transition well out of that?), all three spoke up at once: "No! Stay!  We like you!  You wanna help us revise those?"  And so on.  I was instantly a member of the group and before long, we made our way to the kitchen.  Yes, there was a kitchen in the office..whatev.  All the while, nothing was really said between me and the hottest of the three worker-lesbians, but there was definitely some vibes exchanged.  As the other two and I shared some Better Than Sex chocolate cake and laughed like old friends, She came up behind me, wrapped her arms around my waist and I woke up.  What do you think it  means ??
