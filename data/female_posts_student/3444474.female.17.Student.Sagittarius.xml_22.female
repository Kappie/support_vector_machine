I like it.  Well no, I don't LIKE it, but it just...it hits me somewhere in my mind, or my heart, or both, whichever. All I know is I read it, and I feel so...empty. For no reason.   I have also been listening to really sappy music. All these love songs that I hadn't touched in years. Like right now, I'm listening to Lifehouse...Lifehouse?!  Me?!  What. The. Fuck. :P  "I've got somebody elses thoughts in my head, I want some of my own..."  So fucking true.   Jason, I totally feel you (Jason is the lead singer of Lifehouse, if you all didn't know)  I just want to bleed and get it over with.
