I was really skeptical going into the film, thinking it was going to be a bastardization of musical theatre a la Moulin Rouge.  To my pleasant surprise, it was not only true to the Fosse original, but the cinematography and special effects not afford to an on stage performance enhanced rather than disturbing the suspension of disbelief.  I think most surprising of all, however, was that, occassionally, Renee Zelwiger can actually open her eyes like a normal person.  :)  Well, now back to the lack of reality that inundates the television these days...
