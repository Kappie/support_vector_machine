I just want to forget about it. I finally got rid of the whole convo entirely, so I wouldn't be tempted to keep looking at it over and over again. Regardless, it was said, and it felt as though the words went right through me. I probably shouldn't dwell on it and get over it, but right now I can't. But I want to so much. It'd be easier to get over it if I didn't have to see the words, "I'm sorry", but rather feel it. Feel that warmth and love that surrounds me in his arms and then all this would melt away...      But I promise that this won't last for long, all this will soon be over and we can just check it as another bump in the road and August 14th will be here and nothing else will seem to matter :)
