NOT because I decided I needed some art therapy (although it does have that benefit) but ready for the Paint Factory – kids thing I am doing over Easter.  My splodges aren’t very even though!!  Had a wonderful day out with the kiddies.  I picked them up at 10:00am this morning and we went and picked up another girl and then went to Lizzy’s. We then set off down to the Licky Hills.  Played in the park, went on an adventure in the woods to find buried treasure (gummy bears hidden in my pocket!) and to search for our lunch – which handily appeared when we returned to the visitors centre! We learnt about what roots are and why trees need them (I thought my explanation of them being like straws that the tree sucks up the water through was fair enough, but everyone else seemed to find it rather funny), what stones are called when they grow up and become big, and that if you jump into mud too hard your wellies get stuck and you can’t get out!  The kids were great. Ruth who never shuts up at the moment, didn’t open her mouth the entire time we were with the others! She seemed happy enough, but just didn’t talk! Paul on the other hand, loves an audience and duly responded!  Think we totally shattered them and Ruth fell asleep on the way home, whilst Paul planned our next trip out.  He wants to go by bus, train and airplane next time!     Then went back and Hannah and I decorated my t-shirt, also for the Paint Factory.  She coped with well with the fact that she didn’t come, but I have been sent home with strict instructions to find out about buses for our next adventure!  NO bad things to report today – yippee!  Even had a decent chat with my mum on the phone.  Will write more later, but going to do the second side of my dungarees!
