But today, I am starting something new, it's a different kind of a diet. Everytime I eat junk or something other than my 3 meals of the day, I have to write it down, and at the end oof the day put it all here. And everyday, I have to try to eat less and less, and hopefully that'll one day make me junk food free, and happy. My goal is to lose wait for prom, not back to school, cause that's unrealistic, but by prom, I'm gonna be hot! So guess I'll be back tonight with everything I've eaten...      Lata xx
