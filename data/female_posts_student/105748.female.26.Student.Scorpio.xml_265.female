First they told us that we will only get 1 performance appraisal this year (means one raise).  Now they might not even give me a raise since the head of HR says our region is now a Level 2 which means we are regarded as a low level producer.- levels of pay is lower. Time to call in the UNION.  No democracy occurring at work.  I am reminded of the time Sally Field stands up on a table and puts up a sign...    ~Net
