(just thought i'd share)  jason: it's really funny to read your typing for some reason. it made me laugh. running for cover from jessie? you coward! moo haha!  well, i know i am up at an insane hour of the late evening/early early day, but um... i hope everyone is having a wonderful time sleeping... i think i shall trot off to get some reading in.... everyone listen to icelandic music... it's exquisite... i wish some people were up right now to keep me company.... i'm boooooored yet again... anyway, i'm free all tomorrow up til about 6 or maybe 7. watch, i'll be "studying", and fall asleep flat on my face when we're talking about lysosomes or some other crap like that. i smell more caffeine coming on... yes, for the agenda tomorrow, it's definitely, in order of priority: food, study, cubing...  ok well off to literary madness i go... keep warm in the cold nights and don't forget to cozy up with big sheets. =D
