(Since one of his students was in the show, he told them about my blog commending the show.)  I personally assumed his students would continue reading it from day to day.  He however, thought otherwise.  Well it turns out  I  was right.  Nyeh!  We just found out last night that Damaris Ramos (oh yes I did say your full name!) reads my blog.  How cute is that?!    A big shout out goes to Damaris, Valadictorian of the Coalition School for Social Change Class of 2004.  HEEYYYY GUUURRRRRRLLLL!!  (So you can comment now...)  hee hee!
