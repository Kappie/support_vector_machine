I recently lost my dad to a sudden heart attack. it has been really hard for me latley. alot of the reason i think is that i was there and i saw him die right infront of me.   we went away skiing for the weekend everyone in my family but my older sister and we hadn't even been there a hole day yet. my mom and her friend went shopping for the afternoon and my little sister, my dad and me went skiing. we weren't really experienced skiers, my sister and i only went on school trips before and my dad had never done it before so we went done a couple of times while waiting for lessons to begin.when we went to sit down for a brake a few minutes before our lessons my dad missed the chair. he said that his arm was hurting and that he felt dizzy. the ski patrolers came over to see what was wrong and then my dad went unconsious. all i remember thinking was i have to be strong i have to be strong for jackie(my little sister)i thought to my self that if i start to cry she will really think that something is wrong and will freak out so i have to stay strong. i new something was really wrong when people took me and my sister aside and called our mom.then they said the ambulance was on it's way.  now i have so many mixed feelings it's unbarable. i don't think i could have made it this far with out my awesome friends through the hard times(laura, trisha, ahsley...etc) thnx u guys i luv u all sooooooo much for ur help!  for anyone else out there going through a hard time i no how ur feeling and believe me it helps when u talk to someone or wite or type like what im doing,u may think it's a dumb thing to do but it really really helps.
