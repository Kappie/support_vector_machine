Work was fine, last day is tomorrow so the pizza party is after but we're limited to like 6 trays cause last year we went crazy and i beleive the bill was like $206 and j. mac said he could have a banquet with that much.Whatever thoo. Bobby put ice down my shirt and no one did anything the whole day. He got really pissy and left like 7 times. Too bad he just drove around the block. Then he threw trail mix at me and i was like Bobby! i didn't do anything all day .. and he interrupted me and was like exactly! You havent done any thing all month except flirt with Al. So i yelled shut up and was a little embarrassed cause everyone knows it was true but i honestly dont care. Tomorrow will probally be the last day i see him for a year tho and i think i heard him mutter something about not dating sophmores so i was like .. whateverr.. After Salerno's i think Erin, Katie,and Xtina are comming over so that will be fun of course.       I layed outside for a while today and painted my nails. Then i started packing and i'm deffinately not gonna have all my shit together by saturday morning omg. I cant wait for the beach tho. Me and eileen are gonna tear it up! I feel bad tho because carissa is going the same week or she was suposta and she was gonna bring me. But i'm going so she has nobody to bring. =\ We talked that over a little and came up with nothing.. So she said she's not going which makes me feel worse cause i could be taking her but idk. I'm gonna have a good time no matter what tho... Tonight i had Anna, Mackenzie, Leah, Tara, and Carissa over and we swam and went on the trampoline and that's always a good time. I'm glad i got to chill with all of them before i go away. I also got to talk to Timmy Washo on the phone and i just remembered how much i missed him! I think that was the first time i talked to him all summer and it was for like one miute. That's alrite tho. It's something to look foreward to with the school year even tho i cant beleive i just said that haha. Well i'm gonna go and i shall update later.
