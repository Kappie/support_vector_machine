It seems I've been in terrible shape ever since I quit. It's not supposed to work that way. Oh well, such is life: pain in my ass and several other bodyparts, incl. tongue.  In case you're all wondering, I did make it past DT. I'm already in DF (Day Fourteen), which is very true because I live in Mexico D.F. What are the odds!
