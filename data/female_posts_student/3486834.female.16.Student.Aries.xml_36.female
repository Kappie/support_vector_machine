And today I went to Hurrican Harbor.. so that was really cool, but my face is sunburned, again. It will prolly be gone by tomorrow tho.. I think it's worth it, cause now i have an awesome tan! YAY! I should be home pretty soon.. I think sometime next week.. We didn't get to do all of the things we planned, cause like we have to move, and my family wants to get it over with. I'm a little ready for school. Not like the learning part, but being with everyone. Oh yeah and now Felisha can be in school with all of us!!!!!!! So many cool things happen... like Dylan trying to lick his elbow in Spanish.. and bite his ear in Math class.. That may have been the reason why I wasn't doing good in either of those classes.. Mrs. Johnson had to put me behind Jennifer, and between Andy and Dylan.. how does she expect me to learn..?! And in Mrs. Corona's class, I got a chance to get by everyone.. cause she moved me all the time. At least she didn't icolate me, like Mr. Groves did to me and Santi. He just doesn't like me... and I don't like him. He claims that I talk all the time, but I know that he is still embarrassed over "The World Revolves Around Asia".. I forgot how that started, he said that it revolved around me, and the whole class agreed.. but then he made me feel bad about it.. Uhh.. ok..?
