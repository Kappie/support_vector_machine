So lessee...How do I catch whoever is sad enough to still be checking this poor neglected website after 6 months?  School sucks...I really hate it. I'm not just bitching and moaning like I did at UF...It really sucks. For a wide variety of reasons which I will go into during future posts. To give you an idea here's a brief preview... 1) white folks don't have ethnicity 2) our professors have to ask us how to spell the months of the year 3) I've written more papers on movies than on clinical issues 4) The Golden Rule of Social Work="Cover Your Ass"  Other than that...I'm going to Russia this summer, we're getting a hot tub in a few weeks, Bruce and I are planning a cruise too, I'm in Katie and Shawn's wedding in August and Christy and Jason's next March, I now have 4 animals (2 dogs and 2 cats) and I still haven't taken any pictures of my house since it's been renovated.  Oh yeah, and I finally have internet and a phone line after living in this house for almost a year.  That's it for now...I unfortunately still have finals to study for.   Hopefully there will be many website changes in the near future, now that I don't have to drive to UCF to check my email. :)
