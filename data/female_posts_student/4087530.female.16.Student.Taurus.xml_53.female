You know, the game was published in 1996 and it doesn´t really work on XP (well, I can watch the intro that is quite a pleasure for me, but when I push the left key in the game itself then I just twirl around and I can´t stop it). So I have to find out everything that I can to reconstruct the game as satisfying as possible. I recently searched for pictures, documents etc. Today I wrote off the text of the intro (a somewhat Sisyphean labor^^"). What I fear is that I´m not able to get the story arc for I don´t know the whole coherencies. Well, we will see.
