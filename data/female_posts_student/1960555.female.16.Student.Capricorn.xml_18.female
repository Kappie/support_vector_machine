Criticized for individuality and praised and accepted for for conformity, being youself becomes less and less of a natural thing.  In a land of corn flakes, you are the lone fruit loop.  Proud, but terrified.  Will you smother in the milk of society or climb the spoon of inner peace and just be the fruit loop that you are?    Dickies, sweatbands, spiked hair and new vans.  Which is you, and which is them.  Are you proud od who you are or do you wish to change?  Change to break free of them, or change to become them.  Change to fit in.    'One of them'.  It's a phrase that is envied and loathed, both.  It's quite funny that we lable ourselves actually.  "I'm not like them, and I never will be!"  By saying that, you just put yourself in a category.  You're not like them, but you are like someone else.  You like all the others who 'Aren't like them.'      Individualism is such bullshit.
