Oh goodness, that is a loaded question: 1) Wheelchair guy is cooking some "food" in the microwave that smells like a loose taco stool, and he clipped his nails at work today and some flew on my desk  AND  he is sitting next to me SCREAMING on the phone in spanish.  Like anyone cares about what he has to say?  Lower your voice a) this is an office b) you're so OBVIOUSLY on a personal call.  2)  No cigarettes, coffee or junkfood is making me a mean, mean little girl.  3)  I still have this pesky SARS and I've run out of tissues at my desk so I'm having to tend to my nose with the cheap office paper towelling which is much more itchy and less friendly on my lil nose.  4) Nothing new has happened with my ecosphere...although it does look a little more green today.    5)  Its gloomy and raining today...I don't like it one bit.    6)  I have no money (and I just got paid last friday) and I didn't even adhere one iota to my "get outta debt" plan.  This lack of funds means no happy hour for me.  Le sigh.  7)  I miss Tina  Lisa...neither of them has been on AIM and thus I haven't spoken to either of them.    8)  I need a nap, desparately.
