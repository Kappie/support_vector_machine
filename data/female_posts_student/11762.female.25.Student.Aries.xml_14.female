There is no card that expresses a proper sentiment for the friend who has been laid off from work for the second time in three years, for the woman who choses to have an abortion and struggles with that decision for the rest of her life, or for the man who is diagnosed with HIV and is forced to reconcile himself with the fact that he is dying.  There is no card for my friend, and co-worker, Nancy who was diagnosed with cancer and has spent the last three years battling this disease. Last week, I discovered that her doctor found four tumors in Nancy's brain and that her chances of living to see another year are very slim. I am struggling with the injustice of this revelation. It is times like these that cause me to question Godde's purpose for people. Is this kind of action the definition of mercy? Is it right for a woman, an individual who has never been anything but wonderful to her co-workers and friends, to suffer in such a manner? How does a person live out the remainder of their life, knowing that with each rotation of the sun they are one day closer to leaving behind all that they have ever known?  Sometimes, there are simply no words for the moment, no words to describe the shock you feel at learning that a person in your life will no longer be there to grace you with their smile. There are no words for the sadness, the frustration, and the anger that is felt when good people are forced to suffer and carry an unbearable burden, while the dregs of humanity walk the world and feel no consequences for their actions.  This is the hardest part about being a person of faith, not the theology that you adhere to nor the manner in which you daily practice the rituals of your religion, but the need to keep your hand tight around the tenuous thread of hope. The most difficult thing in the world is to have faith when the entire world tries to pull you away from it.
