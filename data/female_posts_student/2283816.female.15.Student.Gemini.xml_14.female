She was not very little because she was nearly fifteen, but she wore pigtails a lot and those made her look younger.   Anyway, one day, Laura Lee's father came home from a two-day convention in a Faraway City. He came bearing many strange gifts, including several pens, a three-sided highlighter, an action figure of some kind, a triangular ruler, and a squishy yellow bus that said Downey Insurance on the top.   When the Siblings discovered these gifts on his person, they immediately pounced on him in the master bedroom and began ransacking the suitcase. Laura Lee came down after hearing the loud proclamations of "Ooooh!" and "Ahhh!". After gazing upon the items, Laura Lee's father told them to pick what they wanted and leave.   Laura Lee realized the potential this little yellow bus held for her. While she WAS a relatively happy little girl, she did have her Moments. This bus, it seemed to her, could be used to squeeze away copious amounts of stress. So she picked up the bus and several pens and was immediately trampled by Sibling Un.   "That's MINE!!" shrieked Sibling Un. "I picked it out BEFORE YOOOOOU came down here, I told Dad I was gonna get it!!"  "Too bad, I got it first, I HAD IT IN MY HANDS - GET OFF, GOD!!! You know, Dad's standing right here, did that occur to you??"  "IT'S MINE!! CLAIRE, GRAB IT!!!"  Sibling Deux made several attempts to grab it from Laura Lee but failed. Laura Lee raced upstairs to her computer, where she proceeded to hide her precious Stress Bus under her leg. Sibling Un came and threatened to do many things if she didn't reveal the location of the Bus. Laura Lee calmly refused.  As the two Siblings were getting ready for bed, Laura Lee snuck into her bedroom and hid the Bus under her track shorts in the dresser.   Sibling Un barged in and wanted to know where the Bus was again. Laura Lee lied and told her she'd thrown it behing the desk, knowing the desk held many nooks and would occupy this sibling for at least ten minutes. Sibling Un eventually came back, began to search the dresser, touched the Bus but missed it completely. Laura Lee hid her smirk.   To this day, the Stress Bus remains hidden, waiting for the day when Laura Lee snaps and needs to squeeze out a little of her anger. Sibling Un has apparently given up.  THE END.
