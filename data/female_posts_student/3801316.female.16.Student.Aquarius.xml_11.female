Too bad I lost it though... hehe.    Review classes are done na! Actually, this isn't something i'm very happy about. I'll miss it kasi... waaahh. And syempre I'll also miss all the firends I made... Phoebe, Red, Joel, Shinji, Rubber Ramon, Renz, Neil, CJ and everyone else. And yah, pretty pretty Ms. Dewmaine Sales.    One of our pet geese, we have two, died. The female one died and my sister said that the male one was crying daw, he was making all these weird whiny sounds. Awww...    The UPCAT is on the 7th and 8th na. My schedule is on the 8th at 630 am at the DAERS Function Hall. I am soo dead. Soo dead.
