I was there when Scot first met Allison...sparks didn't fly, they didn't really talk  ALL  that much...but apparently it was enough for Allison to say to Jared that she wanted Scot.  I didn't like the sound of that because I know men. Most of them won't refuse a girl who just throws herself at them. Anyways, apparently thats what she did cause a while back she and him made out one night. And now Allison, I guess, is really taken with Scot and wants to hang with him, so she showed up there and started watching a movie.  It doesn't really make me mad or jealous...why should it? but it just sort of disappointed me. I thought that I had finally found a decent guy who was smart enough not to want to do shit like that. But at the same time, I would do something like that with him if given the chance. But the difference is that I've known Scot for a week and a half (yes, I know thats not very long), and in the spand of time I've had a lot of time to talk with him. Like for example, the first night I met him he came over with Jared at about 1:00 am to watch Hidalgo at my place. Jared promptly fell asleep, which left Scot and I to talk and watch the movie. I ended up taking them home at 5, much to Scots disappointment because he really wanted to pull an all-nighter. Thinking back, I really should have done that with him but I didn't because he had to work at 8 and I thought it was going to be hard enough for him to get up as it was. Scot was extremely friendly that night, saying things such as "I never thought I would meet someone here that I completely connect with." I know thats not saying anything, specially nothing in the love department...but when he said that and other things I could just tell that  yes, I do connect with you.     Scot is a great guy, let me describe him for you. He's about 5'11, short short blonde hair and has a little soul patch. I believe he is 22, but I'm not completely sure about that. He's fairly easy going and likes to please. He also loves to drive, and he once told me that he is never comfortable unless he is complete control of the situation, vehicle included. He's really adventurous; your typical "I'll try anything once" kind of guy, which is probably why I like him so much. He also shows signs of a complete gentlemen, like holding open doors and stuff like that. He shys away from talking about dirty or racist things. He's a ruggid guy, and someone who is very adaptive to his surroundings. He can sit in the restaurant and shoot the shit with the old fogies at coffee row, then I see him hanging with the 40-something working guys at 9, then he can come out with us -the seventeen + year olds- and fit in just like that. ...I know a lot more about him than that. I could probably tell a good chunk of his life story.  Its not very often that I find someone that I like, I'm very picky in that department. But I have never met anyone that I have liked more than him.  Conclusion: If Allison and him want to be a couple, all the power to them. But I just hope that I can still hang out with him, because even if it never grows past it, I still consider him a really really good friend.  ~Virginia    This is me...my friend does photo manipulation and doctored up the picture.
