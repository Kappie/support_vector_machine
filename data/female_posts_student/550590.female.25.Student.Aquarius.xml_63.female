Well, the plane tickets have been mailed out and I am on my way to D.C. exactly 30 days from today.  Yippee.  I get to spend almost a week out of Florida and I don't have to pay for ANYTHING--not even meals while I'm gone.  So for those of you in the Washington area, I'll be arriving around 1:30 into Regan National on April 12th (a Friday) and expect to party down on Friday night, sleep in on Saturday and then the conference starts on Monday.  Yay!  My computer is officially virused out.  I had to restart the damn thing 5 times tonight and I've only been up from my power nap for about 45 minutes.  I woke up and thought it was morning and that I was late for work.  Teehee.  Would have really SUCKED for my dogs if it were in fact morning, because it would mean they hadn't been out in 14 hours.    So Rob is awesome (as you all already know) and disturbingly generous and has offered to add a "discuss" feature to my journal.  I want to eventually learn to do it myself, but until then I'm forever indebted to him and will judge all the parli rounds he needs me to judge at DSR this weekend.  Even if it's crappy TCC or Carson Newman (Carson-Newman has parli, wtf?--still shocked over a year later) Parli.  Well, more when there's more to say.  Eventually the  urlLink Words  site will be updated and the poll topic is out and about.  (New themes for my website for those of you who didn't get the memo.)  Mad props goes out to Juddddd who gave quite witty responses and to Thomas who is always the first to respond.  Mwah! to both of you.  Das ist das for now.  Tootles!
