Friday on our walk we stumble upon this house with a swingset in the front yard and sitting on the swingset is what appears to be (and judge for yourself) a  urlLink stuffed KKK baby .  I did not make this up, photoshop it or anything, it just sits out there, I photographed it today because no one would beleive either of us if we just said we saw it.  Billy said maybe it was supposed to be a ghost baby for Halloween or something, but its just one of those things that sometimes you just need to see to believe.
