In both  Heart of Darkness  and Apocalypse now the actions of the people on and along the river are absurd. The absurd actions in both works include waterskiing in a war zone, attacking a nonexistent enemy with a warship, capturing a village for the sake of surfing, and blowing up a cliff just because it's there. Though the absurdities in the two works are very different they create a similar feeling.
