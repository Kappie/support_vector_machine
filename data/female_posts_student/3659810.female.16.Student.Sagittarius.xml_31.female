Meh The Craft.......offensive The ring.......interesting There was one other movie but we were pretty tired and went to sleep instead of watching it. Overly a funny night. Me and JennyJ wouldn't play nice and we kept kicking eachother, ok ok i kept kicking her but she kicked back. Taeghan had to ask us to play nice,i don't do 'NICE' but i waited until morning before hassling her again.   Rhedyn "Nevermore"
