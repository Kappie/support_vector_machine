It's like that Dave Matthews song, "...why do I beg like a child for your candy? why do I come after you like I do..."  We decide that our relationship will be much happier and stronger if we are simply friends and partners in child-rearing, but we can never quite cut the cord.  Cold turkey is probably easier than trying to find a line somewhere between spouses and cordial enemies.  I suppose I should hate him, but that isn't very useful.  I'm angry and disappointed in him.  And I've lost a lot of respect for him, but we've been friends for a long time.  Sometimes it isn't clear where that friend has gone.   It doesn't feel right to dismiss him completely for being a fallible human being.  And when he is supportive and reasonable and rational, I couldn't ask for a better friend.  As long as his shield isn't up and he's not feeling threatened he's really good at being able to see what is important.  He's capable of understanding a complicated situation better than most people.  But when he's ego gets bruised he goes one extreme to the other.  His logical mind completely shuts off communication with the rest of his brain, and certainly his mouth.  But even so, I can be patient and supportive with a friend.  I can just stay away until the temper tantrum is over.  With a husband that just doesn't work.  I expect a huband more from a husband.  From a friend too if it's a new friendship.  An old friend or family member though, you just have to work with them.  But I don't have to take abuse from them.  And I can refuse to attend a pity party or anything that makes me uncomfortable.  Just like I've stopped listening to mom's complaining and I can politely make her aware that she's picking people apart again and I don't want to hear it.  Everything I have ever read about pulling yourself out of depression, etc, says get rid of the of toxic people in your life.  That would be my husband and my mother.  Ooh, I just typed father instead of mother.  I was typing really fast and I typed out "husband and father" without realizing it.  What's with the freudian slip?  Interesting.  I guess dad is a toxic person.  But that was some kind of association between P___ and my dad.  That is worth thinking about.
