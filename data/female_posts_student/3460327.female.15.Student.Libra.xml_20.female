No one else in the world can even compare,   You're perfect and so is this love that we share.   We have so much more than I ever thought we would,   I love you more than I ever thought I could.   I promise to give you all I have to give,   I'll do anything for you as long as I live.   In your eyes I see our present, our future and past,   By the way you look at me I know we will last.   I hope that one day you'll come to realize,   How perfect you are when seen through my eyes.   - Ashley Borden -
