I don't remember whether I actually posted that or not but it leaves me with a profound sense of sadness anyways. Moving on.... Not much is new in life right now.  I was forced to walk a mile today in PE, which I did not appreciate.  I am now sitting in the computer lab for Health, doing this Power Point Presentation on obesity with my friend banish.  I, being the creative genius, did the writing and she's having a blast messing around with the background and such.  She's got little fat men all over the page now.  It amuses me. Let's see....  Next I have to go to Math, which is BAD NEWS.  Why is it bad news?  I'll tell you why: because I gleefully failed the last geometry test because I can't seem to wrap my mind around a simple little concept like similarity and those stupid goddamn setup algebra equations.  Gah, kill them I say.  Hit me anytime with proofs; I'm kind of good at them (as good as I can be at math, anyways) but KEEP THE GODDAMN SIMILARITY RATIOS AWAY FROM ME! Whoo, need to remember to breathe....  If you noticed, I've become another thing!  I was wandering around the internet (bored out of my mind-- would you believe I signed off before my time was done?) and I stumbled across this Cowboy Bebop theme song test that I had taken a while before.  The first time (a few years ago) I took it and my song was "Blue".  There is no coincidence that the song is played during a death scene and that it is titled "Blue".  I was a sad, sad girl.  Anyways, I took it again later after I had gone crazy and my song was "Go Go Cactus Man" and NOW it's "Cats on Mars". I find this peculiar. Why am I not listening to music?  This bothers me.  I will now go fetch my headphones from the depths of the BOTTOMLESS ABYSS THAT IS MY BACKPACK and happily listen to the pretty cool Reunion Show.
