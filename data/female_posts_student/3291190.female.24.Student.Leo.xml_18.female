So I enjoy every second, even those my mind stole. I have lost the pieces to the future, but I am content here  now. Unknowing  unafraid, unaware of when or how. I became overcome with the desire to have you by my side. I realize I donâ€™t want you to leave, showing emotion I usually hide. I lay down beside you tonight, fearful and unsure. Listening to the rhythm of your breath, living in a moment that is pure. With nothing to fall back on but an impermanent memory that is true.  I would loose myself there for eternity if that meant spending it with you.
