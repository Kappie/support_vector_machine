I've picked out two movies to watch,  one is Best In Show and the other is The Ring.  Sounds stupendous so far doesn't it?  And for food we will have chips and dip and pizza and for during the movie we will have popcorn and tons of it.  Then for entertainment we have a couple games if we get around to it,  one is MADLIBS otherwise known as the best game in the world, and then a game called Balderdash.  Another word game and it is really funny.  It is going to be soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaattttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt!  As you can probably tell I'm really excited.  Ta Ta For Now
