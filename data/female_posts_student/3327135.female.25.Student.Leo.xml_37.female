A few days ago, I had a discussion with PH, who is one of the friendliest Flora fans I had known. Being a Christian, PH, had enlightened me about what are the most important things in life. Her words (through ICQ), that said, "Flora is for entertainment and God is the most important" absolutely woke me up . YES!!! That's right. Flora is  ONLY  entertainment. It is time for me to return to God.   I know that I need to have a balance in life. I had already neglected my work and studies for the past two months because of being too addicted to Flora's shows. I think it is now time for me to evaluate what is more important to me in my life.   God  definitely has to come first because without His blessings, I wouldn't be here today. In the second place, are my  family and friends , who had been here with me, supporting me throughout all these years . Needless to say,  Flora  is only at the third place.  So, am I still a fan of Flora? Yes, I am. Still a 100% fan who does not have any other favourite singers, actors, or actresses. And, I will continue to give support to all her work. ;)
