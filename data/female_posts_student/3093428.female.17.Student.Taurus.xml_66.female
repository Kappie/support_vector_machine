After getting my first pay cheque, I realized how close I was to getting car insurance, and how close I could come to getting both car insurance and an editing system! However, to be able to purchase these 2 products, I would have to give up my camp money and not go to Nanoose Bay Teen Camp. It all comes down to priorities now.   First priority, an editing system. For many, many, many, many, many years, I have   NEEDED   and editing system. Once I get one, I can start to edit my train movies and start to sell them! Yay!!! This has been something I've needed for a long time.   Second priority, car insurance. I've needed money for car insurance ever since I received my 'N' in February. Now that Speedy Reidy has official become vacant, it could be all mine! Once again, I've never had the money for this, so finally getting the chance to get car insurance is exciting.   Don't get me wrong, Camp seems Awesome!!! I mean really Awesome!!! But it all comes down to my priorities. The thought of camp came into my head in late June, not many years ago, or in February. Plus, when I'm at camp, I'm missing six days of work, which adds up to about $200 bucks! The only thing that keeps me from not staying behind is the disappointment I leave with friends. I really don't know what to do... I'm praying to see what I should do, but honestly, the possibilities of me staying home the week of the 17th to the 24th are very likely.
