I am currently typing up the next installment, and I hope I get more such reviews.  I love praise, since it is so very rare for me, and I can honestly say that this is one of my better days.  I got my research paper back early for the summer course I just finished today, and to my further happiness, I got a B+.    I hope I get some feedback, since I am used to criticsm and comments.  I will probably post again today, but for now, I have nothing else to say.  When next y'all hear from me, I'll be at my mom's in Colorado, packing my bags to move in with granma and grampa permanently.
