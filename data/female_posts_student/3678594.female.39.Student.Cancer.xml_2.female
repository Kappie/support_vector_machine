The berry flavor is exquisite and intense. A small portion goes a long way.  My recipe is loosely based on a recipe by Ina Garten [the Barefoot Contessa]. She uses 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 2 tablespoons of Framboise, and a loaf of brioche bread. She also uses more raspberries than I do, but, hey, I'm a single parent and raspberries [not to mention Framboise] are expensive!  Summer Pudding:  1 quart strawberries, sliced 2 cups blueberries 1 cup raspberries 3/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup water 13-15 thin slices of white or whole wheat egg-free, dairy-free bread, crusts removed  In a medium-sized saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil. Add the strawberries and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the blueberries and raspberries and simmer 1 minute more. Remove from heat. [If using the Framboise, add now.]  In a medium-sized bowl or souffle dish, ladle in about 1/2 cup of the berry/juice mixture. Arrange a single layer of bread over the berries. Continue layering the berries/juice and the bread, cutting the bread to fit, if necessary. End with berries.  Place plastic wrap over the surface of the pudding. Top with a plate and set a heavy can on the plate to weigh everything down. Refrigerate overnight. Unmold the glorious  red pudding onto a plate to serve.  Makes 6 servings
