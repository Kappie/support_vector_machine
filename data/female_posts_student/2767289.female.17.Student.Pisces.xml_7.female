It’s like he doesn’t even have a clue that what he says and does is stupid, irrelevant, and most of all disrespectful and hurtful!  And at times when I try to explain to him in a CALM voice how his actions bother me… he just lashes out at me and things just are chaotic!  Lately, I haven’t even bothered pointing anything out to him because I just HATE it when he acts like a complete retard afterwards.  He’s manipulative.  He’s stubborn.  He touches his stupid hair too much… he could make it as a fag without even trying hard.  He’s way too freakin self-conscious!  Always asking me about his damn nose, his stupid vein that is somewhat visible where his under eye area is… always ALWAYS asking me about his HAIR!!!  And if I ask him how my hair looks like… he’s just like…hmm…yeah…good….  Don’t get me wrong… I’m not that soft.  It’s just that he doesn’t seem to get it…  He always expects the best for himself and he gets it!  But when people ask him for a favor… he strikes them with haughtiness and refuses or expects to be paid for it.  And he never seems to do things out of goodwill.   Now I’m not saying I completely HATE him… He’s a great brother when he’s not in his stupid mood swing phase.  We have fun at times.  Comparing him now to how he was like just 3 years ago… he’s changed for the better.  But there are still things that he can’t seem to get rid of.  And he’s also seemed to have developed this pride, this arrogant personality.  At times, I don’t even want to argue with him, even though I know I am 1000% right!  And even at those times… I can’t tell if he’s serious, or just being a plain dumbass!   Anyway… I just pray he will change.  Till then, I’ll just express my rage by cursing under my breath and through this blog. LoL.
