Went to 3rd hour and bombed my test (we'll get to what my mom said later) I'm a failure. Cut 4th hour to hang out with Michelle and Gareth. We went to Borders to pick up a copy of Wuthering Heights for English, and then went to Starbucks for coffee. Made it back to school a tad bit late. 5th hour was pretty funny. Mr. McClure was talking with the class about our course selection sheets when we walked into Ms. Otwell's class. Everyone laughed and made smart remarks about our coffee and my piece of crumble cake as we walked in. I laughed hysterically, Ms. Otwell asked where her coffee was, Michelle turned bright red, Cassie rolled her eyes, I laughed some more. David got on our ass about being late to class, and then having our Starbucks in hand. He drank the rest of Michelle's. Forensics was a bunch of bullshit, as usual. Got out of school and Rex had put a illegal parking/towing notice sticker on my car. I got pissed and drove home to waste my time taking the stupid thing off with Skin-So-Soft and window cleaner. Now the oil won't come off my window... bastard. Oh well.  Let's talk grades... They have drastically improved since the beginning of this week. I called my mom when I got to work and she and I worked out a deal that I'd go to tutoring before school (at 6 in the god damn morning), but I get to keep my car. It's fair in my opinion, but did she really expect me to bring that grade in Advanced Algebra up to a B or C from a D-? Hopefully it will come out to a D+ or C-. This Honor Roll crap is driving me crazy. I just need a 3.0 and I'll be fine.  Things are going in the right direction for me. I have great friends, my grades are going up, my tank is full of gas, I have a full pack of cigarettes, I have a job and am getting paid quite a lot (compared to Pinter's), and there might be a new love interest around the corner. *COUGH COUGH* you lost your bet Michelle *COUGH*  I got out of work at 5 to go and see the baseball game with her. "And I'd fuck him. And I'd fuck him. And, oh what the hell, I'd fuck him too..." Desperate. And Joel, and Cole, and Steve, and Michelle you're so screwed. No wait,  I'm  so screwed. lol.  We left the game at 6:30 and went to get gas, then headed to Ann Arbor to chill. "You have to make me sexy." So we went shopping and I bought new shirts. Got a new cigarette holder too. Went to Pinball Pete's and she lost her bet at pool. So I'm getting laid, and she's getting gothed out on Monday. I'm bringing a camera, for both events. I figure if I take a picture maybe it'll last longer.  How many laws have we broken today? I count 16. Michelle has hers up to 16 as well. Let's see if I can figure them all out again.  1. Smoking Under Age 2. Driving with Illegal Substances 3. Cutting School 4. Parking in the Upper Lot 5. Stealing (I got me some new sunglasses... they're purdy. Thank you Michelle) 6. Buying Cigarette's Under Age 7. Buying a Cigarette Holder Under Age 8. Gambling 9. Indecent Exposure 10. Sex with Over Age Guys (Michelle. I'm obviously not getting laid) 11. Drinking 12. Smoking on School Grounds 13. Speeding 14. Smoking in Public Buildings 15. Jay Walking 16. Littering 17. Using Illegal Substances And that's a typical day... Hmm...  Well, I could go up to Kettering this weekend... but I'm not going to. I have my reasons. Paul asked me to today, but I refused. I'm not going to be happy for multiple reasons so I might as well leave it alone. Q is going to have Friday through Sunday off so I'll probably just chill with him ("Hey Cole. Are you thinking about sex?"). Michelle and I are having random movie marathon with Kill Bill 2 and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. We might see a few other flick but I'm going to need a lot of pot and a ton of time in between to chain smoke. But all will be fine. It will be lovely.  I just ate the biggest bowl of cereal in the world. I think that's the only thing besides crumble cake that I've had all day. Ugh... dairy products... now my tummy aches.  Okay... I will leave you on this note because I was listening to this today and it really reminded me of what Allen and I's relationship was...  Will someone please call a surgeon Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart That your're deserting for better company? I can't accept that it's over...  I will block the door like a goalie tending the net In the third quarter of a tied-game rivalry  So just say how to make it right And i swear i'll do my best to comply  Tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together  I feel must interject here you're getting carried away feeling sorry for yourself With these revisions and gaps in history So let me help  you remember. I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear. I've prepared a lecture on why i have to leave  So please back away and let me go I can't my darling i love you so...  Tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together Don't you feed me lines about some idealistic future Your heart won't heal right if you keep tearing out the sutures  I admit that i have made mistakes and i swear I'll never wrong you again You've got a lure i can't deny,  But you've had your chance so say goodbye Say goodbye  I've gotta stop posting lyrics... it's driving me insane.
