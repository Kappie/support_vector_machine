We are not really friends, but we're not enemies.  We talk to each other a little bit.  I'm still not planning on aplogizing for the e-mail, though.  School has been going pretty well, except for science, which is a bitch.  It's pretty hard, we get to work in groups, but it's worth five evaluations.  What a pain in the ass!!!  If we get an F on it, we're fucked for the rest of the year.  Sorry about the language, but it's the truth.  Materials and processes (MAP), is going ok.  My whell-thrown pot better turn out, cause I'm depending on it.  I have finished my first one, but we need two.  Oh well, with one hour and fourty five minutes to work on it, it should turn out well, as long as the clay doesn't get bad on me.  Courtney is in the same predicament as I am, and Colter........  ah, Colter..............  he's bascially screwed.  Today was the deadline for our pots, as tomorrow Mr. Lund is going to show us how to glaze them.  He was hardly done with his first pot today, but then it got ruined, so now, he's totally screwed.  I have one pot done, and the other will be wheel-thrown, so I think that'll work.  I also found out that I will be going to Hawaii in a couple of years.  You see, my cousin wants to drop out, but my aunt told him that if he graduates, she will take him to Hawaii (she's not even his mother, she's his aunt, too!).  She wants my mom and me to come along.  I don't know why my dad isn't coming, the aunt that we're going with is his sister, but he probably won't be home.  Things that made the last few days good: 1. HOTTIES {see Feb. 11th post 2. finishing my pot in MAP 3. easy social studies test 4. cosmic bowling  Things that made the last few days bad: SINCE I'M IN A GOOD MOOD AT THE MOMENT, NOTHING!!!!!!!!
