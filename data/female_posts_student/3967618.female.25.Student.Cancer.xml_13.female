Ironically it is the Republicans (Jeb Bush) who block an audit of the systems, yet are the same who benefit from their use. Krugman does a good job of stressing the integral importance that a paper trail has to the American people's faith in voting. It makes me so angry, reading a  urlLink  recent poll of African American voters   who admit a loss of faith in the system, which to a degree can be credited to the 2000 election. In that election, a group of African American voters were illegally disenfranchised, unable to vote because the system claimed they were felons. Turned out they weren't. It's just fucked up that the Republicans are now potentionally getting what they want--people are disgusted by the system, so they don't vote in 2004.   I haven't been blogging because I have been moving. I am finishing up my last load 2night. I am so happy to be online right now, typing on my pretty white iBook. I feel shallow. When did I become so addicted? Yeah, there were those 3 months when I was 19, when I chatted till 6 a.m. Hey, I was living with my parents. Then I reverted back to my classic self that tried to detest technology, buying tapes and resisting cell phones. My boyfriend had a computer that he brought with him when he moved in, and I jammed out on it to a minor extent.
