Science assignment to be exact, but u know I got a bit distracted by the wonderful world of blogging...i feel very proud to be mentioned on tom's site (thankyou tom :P) and an outsider blogged on our speedo joel website! yay. Haha  You know the scary thing is that the school is probably reading every single word that i write right now. You know they have this freaky thing where whenever you log into your account, a little window comes up and they can watch everything you do, everything you write even, they'd probably know what a big bludger i am too, a minimised website and word documnet on Pompeii, and a million other blog websites being opened and closed, while the actual work part of mi visit to the library is being very sadly neglected. I wouldnt be surprised if they came and told me to get off the computer right now, i mean, they do that often, they see you playing a game and, ooops, before u know it, you're being hastily shuffled out of the library, because they don't want their perfect view of the hard-working Rosevilian girl to be ruined. I mean our motto is actually "Work Conquers All" (Labor Omnia Vincit as it says on our blazer) I mean how sad is that, I personally would have put it as Amor Omnia Vincit, Love Conquers All but u know, meh. Today we have a PD (Personal Development) Day. How fun. Its bludgy tho. We get to miss the 1st 4 periods, to sit around and play with little babies in Hinemoa, but I've heard we have to watch a baby being born and that it is very graphic, not looking forward 2 that, it was bad enuf in Yr 6 in Interrelate, I neva thought they'd make us endure it again! Oh well, I'll keep u posted (excuse the pun :P) Beth
