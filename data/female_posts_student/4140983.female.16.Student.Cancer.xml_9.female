I TRIED, I failed, and trying again would mean I'd lose her as a friend. Besides, she's legal, she can do it legally, and she's going into college. But honestly. I mean, I'm not mad...just disappointed. I looked up to her as an example of what I wanted.  I'm so happy, though, still. Guard got off at noon instead of 3 like everyone else, we get to come back and practice from 6 until 8, when it's cooler. GO GUARD! I don't know what I'm doing blogging when the SMART thing to do would be to go and shower. I can't believe I'm trusting everything to a blog anyway. What if the internet dies? Plus, you can trace people online. I'm not sure if it'd be easier for my mom to find my blog or my journal, just in case, I took the city out of my profile.  I hate it when people do stupid things and you can't help, and there's no sense in losing their friendship over it, but you can't do anything. Yeah. I'll go put a letter in the mail, shower, eat lunch, and pass out. Tara forgot to call Jesse and tell him to call me about lunch, so I guess it isn't happening. Because today's the last day he can call before Thursday. I'm pissed. :-) But still happy.  My farmer's tan hasn't become any less noticeable, but that's probably because I can't compare to how it was before. My legs, however, are awesome. They went from albino to paper to pasty to normal white. I'm no longer a ghost! One more day like this and I'll have the beginning of a tan. The dermatologist in me is kicking myself.  Water hurts my face. I'm actually SCARED to shower.
