I chose this one because the archive thingie is on the left, on most templates it's on the right. Also it has pretty writing where it says Archives and Recent Posts. Actually I think I just have it cuz I reckon it looks sorta odd, so it's like me ha ha. Perhaps it will make my blog that little bit more interesting. Or not. Whatever.  Bye for now ~Hannie xxx
