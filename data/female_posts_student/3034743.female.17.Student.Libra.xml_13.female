It works all right. Stupid me just decided to test it out on the kitchen table. Soda got everywhere...mom was not pleased. It was funny tho. Me and my mom went to the store today, and as boring as that may sound, it was actually somewhat fun.  We were walking by the condoms and I was like 'hey mom, um...can u stop for a second. i need to find something.' and she was like 'yeah, ok' it didnt even phase her that i was joking until i had to tell her. haha.  Anyways, I've come to the realization that if you say wasabi in a japanese-ish way, it is really humorous. Hmm...what else? Oh, I got a magazine today with a quiz booklet inside, so I took some quizzes. Lets see...according to one quiz I am tied with being a party girl and party animal. Basically, I like to have a lot of fun. haha. Another quiz says that I kinda care about my looks. I'll take a second glance in the mirror, but I also know when to draw the line. If I were a coffee, I'd be a vanilla latte. I'm full of natural sugar and i'm lovable, geniune, and have a positive presence.  My rock star soul mate is John Mayer because i'm into easygoing guys who are emotionally available and in touch with their feelings. haha. And when it came down to the "Are you girlfriend material?" quiz, I got Miss Taken...meaning I am ready for a relationship-and it shows. I have the confidence that attracts guys and the selflessness i need to really be there for another person. Oh, and the prom dress that fits my personality is the long, sleek gown because i'm sophisticated beyond my years. I tend to be in the spotlight.  Ok, after typing all that, it makes me wonder...who really believes in these quizzes? I just take them because they are fun and its interesting seeing what they have to say about me. Who makes up these quizzes? That is what i want to know. oh well. My sister just made a bouquet of barbies...damn odd.  Aniwaiz, this is getting long, so that is my cue to stop typing. Tomorrow I go shopping, yay! Ok, now I'm done. Later!
