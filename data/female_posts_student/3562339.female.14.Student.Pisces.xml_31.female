Camp was oodles and oodles of fun, and I'm sure that you all missed me very much. I made tons o' friends, since I decided to get over my usual shyness, and be loud and outgoing. Everyone thought it was funny that I actually said, "W-T-F" like non stop, and several people called me the WTF girl, which is kind of disturbing when you think about it. This other guy, Mark, who's very strange btw, called me the "Hi" girl, since I always said hi to him, and that doesn't sound much better. So I'm now officially the "what the fuck" girl, and the "high" girl. w00t.And bleh, I got a rash from rolling in the grass. >.
