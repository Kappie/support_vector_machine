Everyone who thinks that they are alone in unhappiness...you're not. Don't fool yourself by thinking that your situation is different. Give up the denial that no one suffers emotionally like you do.  You aren't really suffering, you're just going through that stage.  Honestly...you aren't that different...and you aren't that miserable.  Another thing...I realized that there are different kinds of happiness that people experience. The happiness you experienced as a child is something you'll never experience again, so give up the search. When I was young, I was happy because I was naive and innocent.  Now, I'm happy because I'm aware, and experienced in life.  So if awareness and experience make me happier...I have nowhere to go but up.  You have to learn to value everything. That's what makes you happy. Value who you are...don't rely so much on who you used to be.  Probably the weirdest, dumbest conversation ever: LuCkY05106:  i want to rub your arm full of shit LuCkY05106: hahahaahaha CrazyLikeTHAT 87: awwwww LuCkY05106:  and poke it CrazyLikeTHAT 87: hahaha LuCkY05106:  so the shit comes out CrazyLikeTHAT 87: and it will spew out shit CrazyLikeTHAT 87: hahaha LuCkY05106: hahahahahahhaa LuCkY05106: hahahahaha CrazyLikeTHAT 87: i sweat shit LuCkY05106:  holy shit i love it CrazyLikeTHAT 87: haha shit LuCkY05106: haha CrazyLikeTHAT 87: IF YOU CUT ME I WILL BLEEEED SHIT LuCkY05106: hahahaha LuCkY05106: ewwww LuCkY05106:  and it would smell CrazyLikeTHAT 87: aww...sick.
