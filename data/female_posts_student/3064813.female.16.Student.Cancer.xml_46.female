What is the point of believing someone else's philosophies if you can't... you know.  Apply it to your own life?  And what is a better way to apply it than to make your own???  Aaaannnnyways, it's not THAT serious... well.  I guess it kind of is, since it applies to my entire reason for existence.... Since philosophers like to name their... thingies (I did not mean that the way it came out), I'll name mine too!!!!  I'll call this one... THE SOUL OF ROCK!  AAAAAAAAAAAAND here it is!  Because... way too lazy to actually rewrite all of it.  Also, my brain is dead right now as a result of too much inhalation of philosophy, and so I wouldn't really even be able to make it sound pretty....  So, yeah.  Stupid, yes.  Kind of childish, yes.  Irresponisble, yes.  My life's philosophy, yes.   *************: I'm....I don't know what I am. labellily: hmmm labellily: rocker *************: but I don't ALWAYS rock. labellily: doesn't matter labellily: you're always a rocker *************: is that so? labellily: yes *************: *raises eyebrow* how do ya figure? labellily: to rock, one must have the soul of rock labellily: one doesn't turn that on and off labellily: it is always labellily: there *************: you sound like you've put alot more thought into this than I have... labellily: well, when music is one of two things a girl cares about... *************: the other being? labellily: friendship labellily: mom says I have my priorities misplaced labellily: I have to disagree *************: where does she think they should be? boys/kiddies/job? labellily: school labellily: future *************: ah labellily: but seriously, who gives labellily: a flying fuck labellily: about the future labellily: if all you've got is schoolwork labellily: to show for your accomplishments? labellily: I can't believe that the point labellily: of all of this absolutely fantastic life thing labellily: is making money *************: nah, its not. labellily: and stuff labellily: so, yeah labellily: music and friendship *************: *nods* far out. labellily: thanks, I guess  And from there the conversation dissolved into him insulting me about my stupidity and my snappy response (had to fall back on 3rd grade intellect) and, eventually, my sixteenth birthday coming up and it's relative lack of significance.  Gonna kick him whenever I meet him.  HAHAAHAHA!!!  Speaking of kicking people....  Liz's graduation next year.  Ohhhhh yeah, man.  Gonna be wearing steel toed boots to that one....  Jason better watch out...  HAHAHAHAHAHA!
