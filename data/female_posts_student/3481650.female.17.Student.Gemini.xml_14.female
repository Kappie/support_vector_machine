The day before yesterday I had really bad allergies, so when I was trying to go to sleep my face was hurting really bad, especially around my jaw. My whole body was aching...it took me forever to go to sleep. When I finally was asleep, I had a strange nightmare... a drunk guy was in it and I was driving down 2004, it was scary. I woke up at 4:44 all hot and sweaty, I was scared there was some weird drunk guy in my room. There was a tent over my bed (which I took down last night,) that made my room even more scary.  I got up, used the bathroom, and put some water on my face; I felt awful. It took me a few minutes to fall back asleep; I even turned my lamp and the radio on. I had two more dreams, both were also weird, and one involved a couple of bears trying to eat me! How can anyone sleep during such a stressful dream? I woke up at 9:30, and my jaw was still hurting really bad. I brushed my teeth and went downstairs, took some ibuprofen, and went to my mom's room. She gave me an antibiotic, and I felt much better when I woke up 3 hours later. Last night, I talked to Jose until 2:30 or so, and without much hope for a goodnights rest, I went to bed, and slept beautifully. I feel much better today, and my nose is still a little stuffy, but I haven't sneezed since the other day. Today, I went with my mom to Lowe's and Home Depot to get paint for the sunroom floor. I picked out the color, and it's going to be beautiful. We also got a sponge and some accent colors to make it interesting. Tonight I'm going to BCS for a meeting about working with the youth at church, and again tomorrow morning. I can't wait until shopping tomorrow! I'm excited about it...I need pants, shoes, and running shorts. Jose's going to give me piano lessons on Tuesdays... I'm excited about that too. :D
