How easy will it be to post pictures? Can I create subcategories for posting different things such as what movie I just saw and probably didn't like or what I think of some vote in the Senate or does it all have to be together... more like globspot than blogspot... More importantly, rather than sweating to create a forum on a new website we're creating for a conference, should I just create a blog for it?
