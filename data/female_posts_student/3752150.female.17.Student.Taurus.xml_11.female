Perhaps I will download enough techno remixes to make my cd or maybe I'll have a veggietales marathon... oh the possibilities.  Bible study was fun yesterday.  We watched veggietales: I can be your friend.  It was great which is why I was thinking about having a veggietales marathon, but I'm not sure how many movies we have.  Hmmm... I'll have to check.  Speaking of movies, last night I watched Saturday Night Fever.  It was fun and I think I learned some new dance moves.  Who knows what would happen if I tried to use them in public though... could be painful.  I watched it with Ross, Ryan, and BethAnne and we had to brave the severe thunderstorm to get there... oooh scary.  My mom almost didn't let me go... it's like mom, it's just a thunderstorm.  I don't know but anyway.  Ross was extremely cool and gave me one of his Jones.  Berry lemonade even.    Here is a list of some of the new techno remixes I downloaded or will download:  -smurfs theme -cotton eyed joe -spongebob theme -inspector gadget -mr. roboto -holloween theme  there's a lot more but that's all I can remember right now...
