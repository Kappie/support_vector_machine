On the one hand, I am not with my Grandfather who feels it is the start of the New World Order.  But this statement by Gerhard Schroder is interesting:   "We don't have a consensus on a constitution here because one or another country put the European ideal behind national interest."   This may all be well enough, but to imply that his sole motivation is the furtherment of the "European ideal," as some abstract concept that has no connection to what his country stands to gain from that ideal is somewhat disingenuous.  In other words, he is sitting on the largest economy in Europe, and given that the EU started as a economic organization, any furhter integration is surely in Germany's national interest.  And aren't the elected leaders of a country supposed to act in that country's best interest, and isn't that interest  necessarily and inherently  national?  I think Tony Blair (not surprisingly), gets closer to being honest, and right, when he says:   "It is in my view entirely sensible that we take the time to get it right.  To look at this in sort of apocalyptic terms is, I think, rather misguided."   It is interesting, though, that Europe should be having a problem that is so American, that is the balancing of local and federal interests.  Though I guess in the case of Europe this should be national and supra-national interests.  But it is something that the United States dealt with over 200 years ago, not to mention fought a civil war over, so let's hope the resolution to this "crisis" proves less bloody (not that I expect it will be anything close to bloody), especially considering that the reason the EU was started was to prevent further wars among the European powers by so inter-linking their economic interests as to render it impossible for them to go to war with one another.    And it seems largely to have worked; never have France and Germany been so close, though it is not only their economic interests that unites them.
