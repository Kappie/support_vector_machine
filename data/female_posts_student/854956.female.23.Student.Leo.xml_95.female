Sun block or sun tan lotion? sun tan on my arms/legs, sun block on my face 3.  Tunes or no tunes?  TUNES!!!  Who could live w/o music?!? 4.  Jump into the waves or stay on the beach?  I like going out in the waves for a bit... but I also like walking along the beach 5.  Hotel swimming pool or hot tub?  Pool... it's too hot and humid in the TX coast (or any coast for that matter) to get into a hot tub! 6.  Question:  Do you care that I'm so pre-occupied with finals and getting ready to go on a vacation to Port Aransas, TX that I only gave you 6 things to answer for Wacky Wednesday???  I don't care... I have TOO MUCH other stuff going on to worry about coming up with a 10 question Wacky Wednesday post this week... now I have to go to campus and get ready for my politics final... blech!
