How PLANNED was that? I mean...look at the song lyrics, and the fact that her (as timberlake put it) "wardrobe malfunction" was...well...it ripped off a little too perfectly.  Not to mention that they were all over each other, had this suspicious gleam in their eyes, and nobody in the media seemed too sorry about it.  Excuse me for having morals, America. But whatever happened to decency. Oh, that's right. It's been dead for 50 years. I'm sorry, but I and several others don't care to see Janet Jackson's partially exposed breast.  To me, boobs aren't very attractive. Perhaps that is simply because I am of the female species, a Christian, and not a lesbian, so that's something I don't care to see.  But if I may comment, it was excruciatingly ugly. All things of that sort aren't too pretty, as I said above. But STILL.
