Well I guess if I felt like we weren't ever apart that night, I shouldn't expect that the following day to be any different from any other day. I mean that if I have never received a phone call, e-mail, IM, or any other form of romantic gesture the day after sex, I should not expect that now. Even though to me this particular evening was special compared to other nights when we were intimate, I shouldn't expect for it to be any more special to him. If I know how he is then I shouldn't expect for things to be any different this time.   Well the whole thing is that we still have a lot of things to work on and even though the other night we played pretend, the problems are still there. Maybe he didn't call or anything because he wanted the fantasy to last one more day. I mean hell I understand that as soon as we talk we are going to have to work through everything. We also need to decide what we want to do about the fact that he is leaving in a month. I wish this wasn't so hard. Love should be easy. Why on hell isn't it?
