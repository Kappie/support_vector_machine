I’m never going to say goodbye, ‘Cause I never want to see you cry. I swear to be your friend, and a friend I will remain. And I swear it all over again.  I’m never going to treat you bad. ‘Cause I never want to see you sad. I swear to share your joy and your pain And I swear it all over again.    Life for Rent  I haven’t ever really found a place that I call home I never stick around quite long enough to make it I apologize that once again im not in love But its not as if I mind that your heat aint exactly breaking Its just a though, only a thought  But if my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine  I’ve always thought that I would love to live by the sea To travel the world alone and live more simply I have no idea what’s happened to that dream Cos there’s really nothing left here to stop me It’s just a thought, only a thought  But if my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine  If my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine  While my heart is a shield and I wont let it down While I am so afraid to fail so I won’t even try Well how can I say I’m alive  But if my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine  If my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine, Cos nothing I have is truly mine Cos nothing I have is truly mine… Cos nothing I have is truly mine…..   *Climb high, climb far, your goal the sky, your aim the stars*    Moving On  Every day and night, I wonder why things happen the way they do. And I wonder what purpose they serve in my life. As I ponder, my mind begins to wander, jutting to different things. My mind swirls fiercely, and my feelings are mixed. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll really know what’s going on, what’s going to happen. I’m moving on, Its got to happen. Left and right my friends are leaving, not to mention my depression. I’m moving on. Things change, yes they do, Moving on is all I am capable of. And moving on is what I must do. My memory holds previous moments, but there are still pieces missing. But I've got to move on, because the world around my is changing, Changing faster than I thought. My life seems hard. It seems pointless to do what I do. My mind is foggy and unsure, and I’m stumbling around in the dark. My life is changing and I need a steady hand to guide me through. To guide me through this world and my life, my changing life. Somebody, help me move on, help me change. Somebody… (written by me)    white flag  i know you think that i shouldn’t sill love you or tell you that but if i didn’t say it well i’d still have felt it, where’s the sense in that i promise i’m not trying to make your life harder or return to where we were, but  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be.  i know i left too much mess and destruction to come back again and i cause nothing but trouble; i understand if you can’t talk to me again and if you live by the rules of its over then i’m sure that that makes sense but  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be.  and when we meet, which i’m sure we will all that was there, will be there still i’ll let it pass, and hold my tongue and you will think, that i’ve moved on  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be.  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be.  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be
