My razor...its like totally messed. I really really want an electric one. My current razor catches on my skin all the time. Its no wonder I'm so skinny even though I eat about five times as much as the average person--I probably lose so much blood the food doesn't count. o.o   Bugs   I had this horrible itch on my back today. It was like in the middle of my back, and UNDER MY DAMN BRA. That of course makes me really suspicious. Tash once had this bug in her bra and she didn't even know until she tried to scratch it. It was one of those huge black ones, the freaky ones. It was at my house. I think its still lying squashed on the floor. It wasn't a bug but I got very annoyed. It's really itchy and hard to reach. Shit.   More RP Tragedies   HE WAS MAKING MY CHARACTER DO STUFF IN HIS POST!!! Whatever that's called. Either way, HE USED MY CHARACTER!!! I am soooooo pissed, because this leaves her in exactly the same position as before pretty much. Men are total idiots.   Macca's is totally fucked   I had to get maccas for my drama thing. So I miss my normal train in the morning and totally kill myself trying to get to maccas before the next train leaves. AND THEN I FIND OUT THEY ONLY HAVE BREAKFAST MEALS!!! I am sooooo pissed. Again.
