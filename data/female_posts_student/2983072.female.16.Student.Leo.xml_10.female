Like I can't stand it when someone else draws on MY artwork. It's my freaking drawing..get your flippin' hands off and draw your own dangit! Or when some one repeats every thing really slowly to anyone who looks or seems different. Like with my mom the other day she was just trying to ask this lady about where to pay in the wal-mart and she goes and starts treating my mom like she's stupid!  She's talking all slow and loud like my mom is a retard. She's Spanish not deaf.  Geez all because my mom's English isn't the best doesn't mean she can't tell you off. In fact it's amazing how perfectly she'll speak when she's pissed. Needless to say she put that four legged female in her place.  I've also added to this list of pet peeves. Today I discovered I can't stand egotistically loud guys. I mean the really loud and obnoxious ones. Wow as if I wasn't feeling good to begin with,since my eye was about to kill me this morning(it's infected with somthin) I go to school to be faced with none other than this guy that won't shut up and the math class from hell. Now it's bad enough that this guy wouldn't shut up..But he had the nerve to hit on me in ways I found quite rude and degrading. This is the part where I either throw up or turn around and kill him. I held it back..Then he tried to ask me out!  *gags* NOOOOOOOOO! NO! and did I mention NO! That's pretty darn close to what I actually said. This happened at my stupid locker which by the way decided not to open,with me trying desperately to run away. I quickly walked /ran away once I got my locker open after the hundredth attempt and took refuge in my Spanish class, In which Amanda,Brian,and Ali helped me remember my life wasn't a complete waste of time. ^_^  Don't get me wrong though, some guys can be egotistical and quite attractive to me, it's just all in their attitude....Like a good friend of mine has quite the ego and the attitude to boot but he's really not the bad boy he tries to be, you just gotta love him for it. What it comes down to is that a guy has to have a balance sometimes the ego is cute, but sometimes modesty can go a long way.   One more thing it annoys me to no end how some people can't be funny unless it includes curse words or some perverted comment. More points against the egotistical jerk. Where as Bri-anna,Brian,and Ali can make me laugh until I'm hyperventilating and pretty darn close to wetting my pants and I love them to pieces for it. And it's innocent fun you know like in the old days when one didn't need a couple F-you motha-Fers to make something funny. True every now and then something slips but it's mostly idiot teenage jokes that later I'll look back on and be thinking "God I was stupid".  In any case I just had to let the world know what peeves me just in case I show up at your house and try to kill you, at least you know why.    P.S.Nani won't stalk and kill you if you go see her pretty pictures at dev-art  www.deviantart/nani-fox.com                                                                                                                                                     much love, nani
