I just checked the admissions status of my application to Tarleton State University and I got accepted!  My status is sophomore while Matt’s is senior so he will graduate long before I do, but that will give him time to work on his Master’s degree –which he can also do at Tarleton.    Admittedly you are not the first to know.  I told Matt, since he was in the room.  Actually, I screamed and threw my arms up, which scared him nearly to death.  Then, I called my mom –who was in the shower but called me back.  Now, I am telling y’all.    I think that so far this is the happiest day of my educational life!  I am so proud of myself.  I know that Fundamental Christians would say that Pride is a sin, but with this feeling I have right now I don’t know how anyone could ever say that.  This is the best feeling I have had in a long time.  I am so excited –and a bit anxious/nervous- to be going to a University.  Now all that that’s left is to move to Stephenville, which I can admit that I am NOT looking forward to.  The housing is more expensive there and there is nearly nothing to do.  I found out yesterday that they do have an HEB Grocery store and a Movie theater (with 6 screens), so that’s something.  Otherwise all they have is a mom  pop bookstore or two.  The whole town is spread out and it’s major Hicksville!  Still, I would do almost anything to go to a University and get my education.  I am also not looking forward to moving away from my friends.  Truly I do not find it very easy to make friends so I like to cling to the ones that I have.  Right now I live next door (I mean directly next door –our doors are like a foot apart) from my best friend Jennipher –the blonde in my profile picture with me.  We have a good time, hang out, we’re really good friends.  Now I am going to be moving 80 miles away and it makes me sad!  Sorry but it does.  So, when I move I am planning to come to Waco occasionally and see my friends.  Probably not every week, or every month but definitely sometime, when I have some free time.  Who knows, maybe I’ll bring Jennipher back with me a time or two.  I don’t know, what I do know is that I am pretty sad about leaving my friends.  Counterbalanced by the fact that I am going to be hella-glad to get the heck out of Waco and away from certain other people who shall remain nameless for the sake of propriety and friendships, and family quarrels.  You never really know who might be reading this.  So all and all it’s a good day for Kristyn!
