You know the right person is out there but for now your fine as you are.      urlLink                                          Do You Beleive in Love     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    You beleive in it. But have lost your faith in it. Youv probably had quite the past with love and arnt ready to go back to that. You tend to push people away and because of this no one tries to get close anymore. Will you ever love again, maybe someday.     urlLink                                          Do You Beleive in Love     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    these results both describe where i'm at. yeah i took the quiz twice. the first result i think really describes where im at: im fine where im at right now, dont really need no one. the second result describes where my heart really is at: hurt, but really deep down. and i dont wanta get hurt again. yup. in a way, love sucks, but then again its great, not that im sure ive felt TRUE love from anyone other than my parents or sum'n like that. im trying not to get pulled into the whirlpool of fake pretty stuff that love is made out to be. coz i know its gonna pull me down again and smack me in the face with the REAL stuff that love is: hurt, tears, anger, pain. i dont wanta go through that again.
