In the car i just can't wait/ To pick you up on our very first date/ Is it cool if i hold your hand?/ Is it wrong if i think its lame to dance?  After school ended, i went home, took a "chower" got my partay outfit on, straigtened my hair, and left fashionably late. i got there just in time for when the music started. very classy music, like baby got back, tootsie roll, dirrty, and the electric slide. then of course there was the slow dancing, and that gay man that always takes the pictures for buttons. of course i got some classic ones, of me and antoinette pretending we were high on caffinated bevrages. it was really funny. then we did the cottonaye joe (spelling?) so i danced with "katies man" and other random boys i didn't know in the slightest bit. in the end nathan barnett asked me to slow dance, and that was great fun... mostly cause i put my hands around his neck, and he put his hands on my waist, and guys usually don't dance that correct way. and then i went home and found out that i got a CELL PHONE which was also the greatest surprise of the night. and the next day, we went to see santa clause 2, which was OK, i thought it was really funny in some areas. Later on that night, i went to eat with antoinette and caroline, and that was a LOT of fun. we ate at mi cocina, and called william (antoinettes man) and bugged him till no rest. and then we called eachother on our cell phones, and caroline pretended like she had one, even though she was just borrowing her fathers. and then i went to anto's house and we did handstands on her bed, and attempted to to handstands on the wall, but we were too scared. and we tried to do cartwheels onto the bed, but that didn't work out too well. my stomach still hurts... call my cell: 214.629.6748 it vibrates! - You know, who ever invented homework, should DIE! well, i'm sure that their already dead, but if they were still alive, they SHOULD DIE. - you'll remember memories forever! unless you get alzchimers, but that's a different story -me at mi cocina's - I'd better go. not that i have anything to do, i just can't think of anything more to say. oh well! a biento! - Juliette
