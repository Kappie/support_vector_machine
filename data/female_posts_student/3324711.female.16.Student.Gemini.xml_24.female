So Im thinking I wont be doing much this weekend. But enough complaining.. Friday- study. Saturday- work, study Sunday- work, study Monday- school, study Tuesday- Exams. Wednesday- SUMMER = dreadlocks!!!!    10:11PM   Cause maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me.   just studied for hours for ancient history.. still on chapter 3. Couldnt go to tylers house which blows, but Ill be lucky to get out of this exam ALIVE. Yes I felt like being dramaish. My family has gone and left me here to fend for myself against numerous ancient civilizations and random people that are apparently special enough to be taught in schools.  Im listening to Wonderwall by Oasis because it was on the radio upstairs and it put me in the mood to listen to it. I think Ill go to bed early.. How about now?   And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding. There are many things that I Would like to say to you But I dont know how.
