Because to be able to say I exist, I feel I have to imagine myself existing in and of myself, with no one to talk to, no sound to hear, no sight to see, no one or nothing to touch. What would happen to me then? Is there the remotest chance that I can go on being “myself”? I don’t think so. The me that you see today was, and still is being, created by the world. I am the books I’ve read, the people I’ve met (the ones I understood, the ones I didn’t, the ones I hated as well as the ones I loved), everything I’ve touched, everything I’ve seen and heard. If you decide to  urlLink write to me  today and make yourself heard, what will happen is that you’ll join in the creation. My creation. And when you think about it, with you reading this, I have already joined in yours.  You will never be the you who has not read what you just have. Don’t you feel a little violated? Funny ha!  And when you think about it this way, what makes us unique is the special combination. There is no other person on the face of this earth who has sensed exactly the same things as you have. And this is what makes each of us authentic.
