She grabbed her mom and hugged her as I was walking towards her. I didn't do anything! :( I checked the mirror (I didn't look like a complete beast today), I wasn't smoking at the time, and I didn't look at her weird. I did kinda smile, though, 'cause she's fucking corny for looking at me like that. What a punk ass kid. Maybe my all black attire scares people and animals. Who knows? I don't care.  School was fun. We read more stuff about Heidegger. 8-)  There are so many old pictures I took earlier this year that I want to upload. The ones of Tsedey especially. Those rule.   "Quel laid je suis/ Cependant je suis entouré de la beauté" = What an ugly man I am/ Although I am surrounded by beauty   BOO TO THAT THEO! :( I really did cry. Don't make me cry. You're so sweet! and I think you're full of beauty, love. That means a lot...'cause I only call my best friends beautiful. Yeah, the cool kids. Now...you're a cool kid too. Welcome to the club. Hope you get to call me soon. :) Muah.  Well...I bought some hair dye and I'm gonna get that done...and watch some movies I rented.   Beep beep.
