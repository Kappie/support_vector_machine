In fact, nothing went right, but sometimes that happens and you just have to roll with it until everything cools down. I am so beat, I have gotten hardly any sleep in the past week because I love staying awake so much and then I either had to get up early and babysit or wake up at the crack of dawn to go to Tifton with my mom. I was hoping I would get to sleep tomorrow, but I found out that I have to go pull weeds and shit out of the Memorial Garden. I think I'm just not going to set my alarm and sleep until I wake up, and if it is way late, I wont go unless someone calls me, but if I have gotten good sleep and I wake up in time I will go. I'll get to tan some too. I just dont want to get tired out in the sun all day working. I want to be good and energetic for our last show here :( I dunno, but I really need to go since I feel like I'm going to be a weak officer next year with all of my commitments to drama. Like being gone the first week, which is our big week and during One Acta lot of stuff goes on. I thought it was fawesome that my three best friends and I made up our class's officers (Sara is Student Body Vice Prez, Rach is Jr. Class Prez, I'm Jr. Class VP and Lisa is Jr. Class Sec/Tres.) but it is definitely going to be hard with all of us missing fromprojects and events. We'll make it work, for sure. I'm just excited about being adrama officer this year. I'm so happy I dont have two offices like I thought I wanted.That was really strange how that worked out.Ijust ran for Jr. Thespian Secretary because I wanted to run for aThespian office andI thought it would be interesting to see what happened if I ran against Sara. Ifelt bad when I got it and I really hoped that I didnt get Historian then because I knew Sara would be pissed, but I didnt and it all worked out cool. I wonder who I will work with now that Jason is staying. I want him to be able to keep his job. Oh well, I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Well, I think I'm going to go read my awesome five hundred and thirteen page philosophy book that I have to read for Mr. Davis. It's actually really interesting. I need to go change out of my fun pink outfit that I wore today too.
