It is sure to be a weekend full of girly stuff, like pedicures and manicures and (my favorite) shopping!  But, upon my return home, my roommate will be back in the apartment. It is officially our last week living together, which I am very excited about, but at the same time, wish I had the weekend to myself. It has been so nice having complete reign over the apartment. None of that incessant chattering about school, school, and more school.  Before she gets home, I am trying to tidy up the apartment. A few weeks ago while in a drunken rage, Monica and I pulled off an ugly "berry" wreath from the living room wall, which we both expressed disdain for and threw it on her bed. So, I had to replace the wreath and wipe a few loose berries from her bed.  I am also taking a few moments of silence with the various "American Flag" decorations that I have been forced to look at for the past year.  Sure, I have grimaced at them every time I pass by and I can't say that I will miss them in my new apartment, but in a way, we have bonded...mainly out of my intense dislike for them. But that connection, bad though it may be, is still there.  Plus, I have somewhat tolerated my roommate's ultra-needy cat, who I have dubbed "Thurman" (after the fat kid in  Bad Santa ), who jumps on my bed in the middle of the night and stares creepily at me in the dark.  Despite this, I am glad to be moving out and just wish that this next week will be over as soon as possible.
