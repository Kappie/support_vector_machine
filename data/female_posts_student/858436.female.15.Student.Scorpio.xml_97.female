We ordered pizza and then went to the 9:15 showing of "Spiderman 2" at the lovely Malco Trio. What an AWESOME movie! I seriously loved it. Way better than the first one. I wanna see it again. Totally kick-ass.      And then we stayed up until 2:30 talking and stuff and then had to get up at 8:30 to get ready to go to church. So I'm pretty tired. But I took a nap because then I had to go to work! Haha.       And then I talked to Rebecca and turns out she can't go to the John Mayer concert with me.. so seriously if you wanna come tell me because I need someone to come with me. Buy your own ticket, but we'll let ya stay with us haha.      I love the new "I Love the 90s" shows! Hehehe.       And another random list since I am bored..       CDs That I Want       Ryan Adams - Love is Hell   Dashboard Confessional - A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar   Oasis - (What's the Story) Morning Glory?
