 You have a Lost Soul. No one is really sure what
 that can always mean, because it can be defined
 in many ways. As Legend goes, lost souls were
 the spirits of passed away people who are
 neither in heaven nor hell. They walk the
 earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing
 when you expect it least. So hence, if you have
 a Lost Soul, then you are probably very
 insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box,
 you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont
 know your place. You seemingly dont have a
 place in society or an interest. You are a very
 capricious person, and are confused and
 frustrated about where you belong. You crave
 for the sense and feeling of home-but have not
 obtained it yet.

  -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which
 means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're
 the kind of chick that can hang out with your
 boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't
 care about presents or about going to fancy
 placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy
 being around your boyfriend.
