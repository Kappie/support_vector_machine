My titles are usually whatever pops into my head (and lately I haven't bothered to use them at all, at least not always), so I'm not sure if I should have a scheme...? (Unless random counts as a scheme, haha.)  So, about me...I'm 16, a sophomore (soon to be junior! YAY!) at LN where I'm in choir and on the yearbook staff. I'm involved in way too many extracurriculars for my own good -- not that you'd know, because school currently swallows up all of my time! If I'm not stressing out over homework, you can find me online, with friends, or doing something with music. I have an older brother who's a freshman in college (well, technically sophomore, now) and a cat named Harry Potter (NOT Hewlett Packard! :-P). Uh...is that enough? lol  In other news, the choir concert was last night, and it was AMAZING! It was a pops theme (radio hits) and I think it was the best choir show I've been in. All of the choirs had great songs, and the audience seemed to be really into it. It was so exciting! Sad, too, though, because all of the seniors are leaving. *tear*  Well, I'll stop for now. See you later, my fellow bloggers! :o)
