I felt the need to update because I am about to consume a twix bar, chocolate pound cake (made by Allison and without any landslide effect whatsoever), and MINTY GUM!  Nothing, however, about Mentos which makes me very sad.  Do I even like Mentos?  Blearg.  I dunno.  It seems as if it would be a fun thing to like,  don't you think?  Aaaanyways I think that I'm going to get kicked off the computer soon, either because Allison has come to drag me away, or the evil, nutty librarians have decided that I am not using the computers in a wholly wholesome way.  EVIL, BAD BLOG!!!  Yikes, okay, she's looking at me!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
