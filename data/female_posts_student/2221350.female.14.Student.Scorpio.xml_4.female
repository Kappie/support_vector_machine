Has anyone besides me noticed that the posting part of my site takes forever to load? i think it's that sound clip i put on that makes it so slow. So if you click me and all you see is two blue columns, then don't give up just yet. But then, if all you see is blue columns how would you be able to read this message? Oh well.  This morning we went to waffle house and had ((you guessed it)) waffles. It was quite tasty.  Because i will be bowling/spending the night/doing something fun tonight, they have piled on the chores which is why i have to cut this post short. Be back tomorrow for more adventures of Caitlin... The uh.... Blonde one.
