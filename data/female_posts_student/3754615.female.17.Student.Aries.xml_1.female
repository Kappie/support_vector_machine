So the only thing left to do is go to warped in Toronto... But I gotta get the money for that, and convince matt to come. I know this can so work! lol I have family there so its all good. How hard can it be to save up 500 dollars by august 14? Not hard? I hope not lol. It sux though I sorta have to take a vacation from work because I'm going camping YAY!! But that means 5 days of not working. Man I used to work almost every day with my old job, now sport checks got me working the shittiest hours, it rely bites, but o well, that's life, ill figure something out.. Always do lol C YA!
