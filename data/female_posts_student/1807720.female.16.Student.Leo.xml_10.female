I didn't really notice how bad things are going during school because I was busy with other things but tonight I was jus thinking and a huge rush of tears poured from my eyes.  I don't really think it is normal for a teenager to cry almost like every second night or sometimes there have been weeks where I just cry at night but it is getting bad.  I got a 35% on my social M.C. test but I did way better on the long answer and got a 75% so like I do know the material I just don't know why I have to fuck every damn thing up.  I was working on my math but I kept crying and so I decided I would write in my little journal thing cause I just need time to think about things in my life right now.  And well I don't understand the Chem stuff we did today and well I keep trying to inform my math teacher that I really don't understand but I just feel ignored and unimportant.  I am worried about the quiz Wednesday - after all who wouldn't be worried if they didn't understand.  And I tried to get some help today during tutorial but like there was only one lady in the room helping people and there were alot of people with questions so I could barely get any help.  To be honest the schedule and the tutorial thing worked way better for me last year and I was so much happier.  Although I try to put on a nice little smily happy face at school it is hard sometimes.  If someone where to look into my eyes and just "look" as they say it the eyes are the window to the soul.  And yes they truly are because when I stare into my eyes I see all the hurt and pain I feel.  And all the irrational thoughts I get once in a while were coming back into my head again tonight but all my dreams and hopes me so much, which is probably why I haven't given up.  But I don't know what to do and I don't know why I just can't understand like everyone else.  I mean I am going to the resource room, I'm asking questions, I am going to tutorial and stuff and I mean I don't know what else to do.  And my marks worry me because that is the ONLY thing my parents ever talk to other people about, like last year how they were like "Oh and Vanessa is on Hounors w. Distinction" and blah, blah, blah.  Now what the hell are they suppose to brag about...that I can barely get good marks anymore.  Hmmm lets see...I can only wonder, they probably just won't talk about me at all like I am so unimportant and they only seem to worry mostly like about Ben and Melissa and everytime my Dad flys in he is always at his place and the only time I saw him last time was when we ate meals.  I just wish there were answers right now, I wish that someone could explain to me why everything is so difficult right now and is eating away at me self-esteem, self-worth, and at my heart and happiness.  I wish that I could wake up and everything would be ok - but in reality it just isn't ok.  And I wish that someone could look into my eyes and truly understand what I am going through and feeling and I wish for once that maybe someone could just be there for me to hold or hug.  To just stand there and feel someone else's arms around me reasuring me everything will be alright and just holding me for what seems forever until everything feels alright.
