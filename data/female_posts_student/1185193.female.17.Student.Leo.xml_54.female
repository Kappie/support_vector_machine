She is constantly annoying; it is like a  perpetual mannerism with her, and it is so irritating.  Irritating to the point of insanity.  Here's how our conversation went when I got home from school: M: Hi Grandma. G: Hi honey, how are you? (Gosh, I HATE when she calls me baby names) M: Fine.  Would you like to go out to lunch? (Asking out of feeling some strange obligation) G:  Oh, I have so much ironing dear.  (OKAY, really, my name is Megan) M: Are you sure?  You know you don't have to do all this today. G: Oh, sure I do (saying it in her recalcitrant way).  It's my job. (By the way it's not, she just feels obligated because we give her money each month to live on) M: Okay.  Well I'm going to go out to lunch myself then. G: Bye honey, be careful. (door closes)  I come back home after Elephant Bar and Santanna Row and she is standing by the screen door, peering outside with her coat on, her purse in hand, and her miscellaneou (sp?) black bag.  G:  Where have you been?  I've been waiting for you! (She exclaims in her sweet, prying grandma way) M:  You don't have to wait for me.  I do have a key, you know. G:  Well I got worried.  I thought you were just going to lunch. (I'm thinking--Grandma!  I am almost 17, have my own car, and am self-sufficient, PLEASE, I don't need a babysitter) M:  Would you like me to give you a ride down to the bus stop? G:  No, I'll walk (she says in her pitiful voice like if I ask her again, she might take me up  on the offer) M:  Okay, well see you later.  Bye, grandma. (door closes)  Now some of you may think I'm being over-critical.  She is not a complete sour apple all the time.  She is a wonderful old woman, but as she ages, she seems to get more and more on my nerves.  For example, I tell her that I don't want her to bring me fatty foods and candy every week for me because I like to eat healthy things.  She says Okay.  But every week she brings candy and swings the bags of gummy bears right in front of my nose, talking in a tempting voice like I am a baby.  Also, since she can't see that well, she has been smearing the writing on my shirts when she irons.  I asked her several times nicely to not iron those shirts anymore, and she continuely does!  And she excuses herself by saying, "Oh, you don't want to go out looking all wrinkled, do you?"  AAAHHHH!  I'm going out of my mind with this lady!  But I continue to be nice.  As you see in the conversation above, there were many times when I could have blown up at her.  So I'm not that terrible of a granddaughter, am I?
