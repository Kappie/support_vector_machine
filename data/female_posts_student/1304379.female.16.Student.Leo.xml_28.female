However, daredevils Jun Jie and Yong Quan were fresh graduates stepping into the competitive world of business, they wanted to have a share of the large pie. They got down to the nitty-gritty of the problem – financial aid, and got a loan from an overseas bank. They started a Trusty Fund where both of them pooled their money together for further investment plans.  Within six months, the business boomed and company revenue increased exponentially. Their careers took off successfully simply because they strived for excellence and were cooperative. In addition, they were also the best of friends. However, everything that goes up got to come down one day.  Yong Quan was a habitual gambler and had lost a hefty sum of money in shares recently. He resorted to embezzling company funds. This resulted in lesser Trusty Fund for further investments and work efficiency dropped drastically.  As for Jun Jie, he was a debonair who was loved by many women. However, of all women, he chose to have an affair with his best friend’s girlfriend, Mei Ling. They betrayed each other’s trust.  For their own selfish gains, they crushed a friendship built ironically, on trust.  Jun Jie kept running away from Yong Quan and vice versa. They were avoiding each other as both best friends were being pricked by their guilty conscience. They did not want to lie to each other, yet inevitably, they felt that they “had” to.  Two months later, their business crumbled. It was like a miscarriage, eight months of nurturing, so close to “birth”, yet they had crushed what they both had built by hand. They had to keep on running. They had to run away from debt collectors, run away from investors and run away from the broken pride of a failed business. They had to run away from the dissing relatives, run away from each other and run away from reality.  Yong Quan had a rocky relationship with Mei Ling and he decided to reconcile with Jun Jie as he felt that friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love. Or is it?  He went over to Jun Jie’s house hoping to become friends again. Yet to his amazement, the girl whom he once dreamed of as his wife was lying in his best friend’s arms. He could not believe the cruelty of such infidelity and betrayal. “Yong Quan! Believe me, He was just helping me to fix the light bulb.” Mei Ling cried out defensively. Yong Quan was flabbergasted. He could not believe the lies sprouting from his lover’s lips he once kissed.  From then on, there was a truce between them. They gave each other the cold shoulder. They did not cry from the cold without, they cried from the cold within.
