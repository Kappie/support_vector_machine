One after another as I kept begging for 5 mins pls! Damn! Finally I woke up and rush into the bathroom for a shower immediately to keep myself awake. Haiz!! The cab will come in about half an hour time and I was busy looking for my scarf and my things I needed to bring to school... Always so fucking last minute! Was busy searching when Min called and said she needs some bread. She was having gastric pain! Hiak! So early in the morning man... There was no more bread so I got her some biscuit instead. Hee! BOH HEE HEH MA HOR!    I got out of house as soon as I received a call from Min and waited at the fucking bus stop for almost 10 mins and moreover, under the sun! Got so fed up and called Min, "Where the fuck are you now? KAOZ! I have been waiting for the fucking past 10 mins okie!" She then said there was a traffic jam and they are reaching soon lah... TMDZ! I decided to walk down slowly, taking my own sweet time after today! PUI! Reached school at around 9.10am and went for a puff at the smoking yellow box! Yes, the yellow box that I always crack some stupid joke about it! Shall tell you guys some other time...    Had a hard time trying to locate our class and when we finally settle down, the class was like "DUH"! Those people look so kiddo and like so stupid, strange enough, Joscelin actually think they look smart... HURHUR! Time will tell I supposed... We were introduced to our course tutor and also a welcome reception... LAME!! Got to our classroom for the next subject, "MACRO ECONOMICS"! SUPER HIGH MAN! Miss Nancy Kong again... Used to sleep in her lessons man when I did MICRO ECONOMIC and STATISTIC. Oh, and yes, I flunked STATISTIC badly, couldn't even be bothered to finish my exam papers. :) She break down our project to us and I went out to pick a number representing the topic I'll be doing with Min... Today is the KNNH THE SUPER SUAY... I picked one of the most difficult topics... Haiz!! Went for an early lunch but I have no appetite... I miss my darling badly and also, too tired to even eat a single shit... I had some YONG TAU HU but gave a lot of things to Jos.    Miss Ann Ang? I have always heard of her but never did I once see her in school throughout my on and off 4 yrs of studies... She was supposed to be a very stern person as many TO are afraid of her... She came into the class and looked at the clock on top of the wall and said, "Okie, class will start at 2.30pm". She then proceed to the chair and sat down reading some stuffs... Weird, it's only 5 mins from 2.30... SO FUCKING CALCULATIVE!!!! Anyway, she appeared totally different from my expectation... She looked like Andrew Lim in Under One Roof! KAKAKAKKAKAKAKKA! I laughed my head off while telling my friends. She gave us all a mission, which is to draw something that you thing symbolised you and pass it to the front. As usual, I am always the fastest in doing anything~ **GRIN**    I drew a TV. Weird, I wanted to draw a tree or perhaps a lamppost but I changed my mind since we are to describe why we draw what and what, so and so... The first guy who was picked to introduce himself left a very deep impression. He sketched a dragon and it was made of just some lines but I managed to see it as a dragon. He then came out to describe why he drew a dragon... Impressive speech and power speaking. Jos thinks he is the cutest guy in our class. HAHA! Nice face but too short for me liao... Anyway, I have darling liao! Don't be so greedy! When it was my turn to describe, I stood up and face the class then I said, "Hi class, I think I am a TV because I can be switched on or off as and when you like. From me, you can extract any information you wish to know just by tuning the channels and also, I can be of any personality you like me to as I am versatile." Hurhur! Power man, those people look at me with a WTF look... I am too intelligent for them! Some can't even describe themselves at all. LALALLALALA!    Anyway, was rather disappointed that I wasn't able to get into Min and company's group for our project as I had picked the last 3 numbers to choose a group! SUAY LIKE I'VE SAID! FUCKING SUAY! Still, everything happened for a good cause like I've always said too! The system of choosing a group is fucked man... Like what Miss Andrew Lim said, "It's all luck sometimes and you can't deny the fact that luck is an important factor in our lives." Of course, I am not stupid... Well, guess what, I got into the group same as the "Dragon" guy! Wow! We are so gonna be the best of the best project mates... The rest of the team includes a cranky Malay girl, a plain looking Chinese girl and a Chinese from China who is very fluent in her spoken English. Nice~    OMG OMG! Sucked to eternity! First day of school only and we were given 7 projects all together! WTF? Macro Econs took 1 project and for this Behavioural Workshop, 6 projects which includes 2 individual assignment and 4 group work... All to be down within the next few weeks... Sob! I am so shagged and sleepy and tired but still have to bear with all these shits... HAIZ!!! Anyway, it was fun having the group discussion... My team really proves to be one of the best I guess... We are organised and also, very efficient in a way. We exchanged numbers and email and also, got to know that the "Dragon" guy drives and where everyone stay. We are even prepared to burn our SUNDAYS as there are really too many things to work on... SAD! Poor Yvonne and Lunatic Fly are so gonna miss me! HURHUR!!!    I took a cab home immediately after we were dismissed from class. Was too tired and all I wanted to, was to speak with my darling... He must had miss me like crazy too because he tried to get to me in vain for a few times... I went shower as soon as I am home and turn on my pc straight after... Darling was excited to see me online... He made a poem for me while waiting for me patiently at home. It was his first off day and tomorrow, he'll be off too.... Poor baby.... See below for what he had wrote okie and try to see the first word from every sentences... He is so sweet okie! I love him so much! Hurhur!     Just a smile would melt my sadness,  Extracting from within my happiness.  Sweetness and beauty made a perfect blend,  Sinking in the serenity of paradise lands.  Isolating the black and the white,  Cascading the letters on the extreme left,  And you will know the angel of my heart.     I was talking with him on the phone and felt a sudden weight falling on my head... Very heavy and very sleepy... I was trying very hard not to fall asleep as Min reminded me I will sleep and wake up in the middle of the night again! YES! I HATE THAT! Well... in order to keep myself awake, I asked darling to read to me those SMS that I sent him in the past. Hee! I wanna HUI WEI a bit! KKAKAKAKAKKAKA! I think he read about 6 or 7 of them and I dozed off loh. He didn't wanna put down and was hearing me snore till my hp rang at 8.30, waking me up... ADOI!!! I woke up and told darling, I wanna put down the phone and sleep... I cannot tahan anymore... He said okie and we put down the phone and I fell asleep like a pig all the way till 11.45pm. I woke up and was like "DUH"... How sia like that, sure cannot sleep till late late one... I called darling and he picked up after a couple of rings unlike the usual him, always picking up so fast, probably within 1 ring! Poor darling was trying to sleep first as he thought I would wake up later around 2 or 3 am and he could spend the time with me... SOB! How sweet!! Darling is so nice to me! BOOOoOooOooO HOOooOOooOoo!    KK, I think that's all for today folks. Once again, Jess gotta research on some things needed for my projects. Miss ya guys!! MUACK!    Kisskiss!
