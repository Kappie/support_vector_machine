The song itself, has loads of fast-paced guitars, scratches here and there, sang with a funky typa tone. Yup, I just remebered that I should clarify that "Motion City Soundtrack" is a band, and not a soundtrack. It's the name that evokes awkward questions like, "Is the movie nice?" or "I've never heard of this movie". So, "Motion City" is NOT a movie, the band's name is "Motion City Soundtrack".   How I learnt of this band?  As most of you know, [which is happens to be me, myself and I cuz you guys don't read  blink 's news] Mark, if I'm not wrong, is the producer of their album scheduled to come out later this year. Upon reading the news, I guessed some  blink  fans went to find out what this band's all about. So happens that this song,  Capital H , landed in the Web Radio of  Blinkcentral . So I heard it and bla bla bla... you know the rest.  Maybe I'll be too lazy to even go to angelfire and delete, upload, copy and paste....[you know the details] I haven't decided what I should for my "Feature section". Right, right!!! I just remembered, I'm supposed to advertise that  Charmed , the new season, is airing on 18 aug, ev weds, 8.30pm!! Cut the shameless advertising for channel 5, back to my comments.  Charmed  as always is airing at weds, which makes me wonder is it a *insert word here, something like coincidence but better than that*, cuz they emphasized a lot on "the power of three". Weds, happens to also be the "3"rd day of the week. Is this a conspiracy? A curse?   ^^If you read that, you're probably thinkin' that I'm a lunatic to even have started thinking about it.  I'm a blood type A, A people think a lot [and become geniuses like me]. Pardon me for being so shameless. Ugh.
