I looked at some capri's in Abercrombie but they were a lot of money so I just put them down. Then I went into Aeropostal all I found 2 bathingsuits I really liked but for one of them the bottoms were too small for my fat ass so I got this other one instead thats not as nice but decent. I also got a beach bag. I really wanted a Coach one but, for 18 dollars, this one wasn't too bad compared to the coach one which would have been like 180 dollars. Then we ate chicken and ran into Mike Wolfe who got a big hug and then we went home. I love driving, it's so nice. Like, I told Deb, "Dude, we don't have to wait for anyone, we can just go... don't have to wait outside, we can just go... don't have to meet up anywhere, we can just go." it's so nice. x0x
