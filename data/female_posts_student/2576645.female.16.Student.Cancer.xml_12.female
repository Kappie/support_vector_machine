I went to school, harboring ideas of somehow killing the stupid person who made our school days begin as early as they do, and tried to get through all of the uselessness of algebra unscathed. When school was (thank god!) finally over, I went to Simone's house and hung out while she got her stuff for our journey to Reeths Puffer, cuz we had to cheer there at 7:30. The bus ride to 'Rockets' territory was entertaining since I had applied my good idea of bringing my cd player with the best cd ever (Guster, 'Keep it Together'...I pity if you have not heard them yet) tucked neatly inside.   After the game had ended, (we won, of course!) we cheerleaders were just happy that we could at last sart heading towards home. .....but fate had different plans.  The bus broke down in the Puffer's parking lot. It would not start. AT ALL.  And despit the fact I was being throughly amused by the reckless teenagers doing doughnuts in the empty parking lot now and then, I was getting sick of a certain someone's hyena-like laugh. On top of the fact that we were stranded, the only adult we had on board was the bus driver, Mr. Bob. Now, Mr. Bob was extremely pleasant, and I am just thankful he was not some ex-con murderer. We called Coach O and we managed to get some parents to come out and get us, but not before some of the girls couldn't feel thier toes.   Ah well....it was much more exciting at the time.  I have to go prepare and study for exams (and by that I mean I have to go procrastinate and play 'The Sims'). See ya lata alligator!
