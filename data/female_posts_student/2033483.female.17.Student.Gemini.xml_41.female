I got a haul this year:   From my Friends:  Megan gave me a gift certificate to the mall; Jessica gave me this really cute key chain, a candle and an air freshener; and Emily gave me lotion.  From Brian, Tami, Andy and Alex:  Best Buy gift card and a bag of candy  Mom and Dad/Santa Clause:  cds, clothes, a palm poilt, purse, seat covers, calender, two belts and jewelry  Person Christmas:  a Mickey Mouse purse and lotion  Weber Christmas:  gloves, socks, dispolable camera, gift certificate to Burger King (yum!), gift card to American Eagle, and $50 from Grandma and Grandpa  Christmas is wonderful.  Their are so many people at my house right now.  Brian and Andy are staying the night.  That is a bit odd because I don't think Brian has stayed the night sense he moved out some 10 years ago.  But it is nice to have my brother at home again.  I suppose I'll have to go shopping with my mom and aunts tomorrow.  This could be boring but could also be fun, we'll have to see.    Oh funny story that may not be such a funny story.  So I was talking to Rachael the girl I was babysitting for and I told her that I heard her grandma was really sick with a cold (her grandma and my grandma are sisters) and I also mentioned that my mom was sick and might have influenza A and that was why I didn't want her too close to me.  Well Rachael turned around and told her mom that her grandma had cancer.  Needless to say I got a phone call.  How she got cancer from a cold is beyond me.  My mom thinks she thought Influenza was cancer.  But yeah now I have to watch what I say apparently.    I want to be vauge in my blog too, like Lizzie is in her's and Brad is in his sometimes.  There are people in this world that will stab you in the back and then there are people that are there watching for them ready to turn the knife around.  So no matter what just know someone always has your back!
