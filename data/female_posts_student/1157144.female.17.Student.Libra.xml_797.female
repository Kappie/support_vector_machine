I HAVE A NEW STALKER.... i seem to be really good at picking up these fucking people. twofrom RYLA: one that knew jessie and was annoying and tried to talk to me when i was having private conversations with the misses and another that tried showering with me *shudder*.  i had one annoying one from geek camp, this black guy sam that had BORING STUPID WORHTLESS stories, the worst sense of humor, and the annoying habit of side/back tapping and shouting your name to get your attention.  oh yeah, i also got one from swimming...  this girl's rap sheet: i took a sip of her jamba juice. ONE SIP! she didn't even swim that day either, just stood outside iwth a fuckin jamba juice.  whenver i log on, she IMs me INSTANTLY... until i blocked her.  this morning, she got revenge.  luvablethistime: HEY feral ryan: hey feral ryan: who is this luvablethistime: Sarah Hollenback luvablethistime: from swimming luvablethistime: the on u got the jamba juice form luvablethistime: hehe feral ryan: hi luvablethistime: How come u bloked me on my other SN? feral ryan: cause i was at davis and the comps were slow... i just wanted to talk to close friends luvablethistime: can u unblok me now? luvablethistime: Its Tiggerrules2707 luvablethistime: Ryan?? feral ryan: well. um, we really don't have much to talk about-- i don't have much time when i sign on so luvablethistime: please luvablethistime: i need to talk to u feral ryan: why u don't even know me luvablethistime: u gave me ur screen name!!    luvablethistime: u drank frommy jamba juice..u coached me...i know u! feral ryan: i thought ud say hi, season when well, thats it... luvablethistime: so u dont want me talking to u? feral ryan: yea no offense but its kinda creepy luvablethistime: what kinda creepy? feral ryan: u IMing me all the time  (went to eat breakfast)  luvablethistime: i wouldn't IM u all the time luvablethistime: i would say like hi whats up, g2g, bye or whatever luvablethistime: ... luvablethistime: fine be that way    ADVICE TO ALL: to avoid going through this traumatizing experience, setup a second screename to FILTER those fuckin stalkers.  thats what i'm doing.  no more giving out my normal screenname
