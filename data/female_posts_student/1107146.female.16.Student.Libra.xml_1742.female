I'm proud to say that I reached 100 and plan to stay there, since that is almost the weight I was at 3 years ago.  So, there.  Of course I was being sarcastic.  Seriously, what did I say in one of my first posts on this blog?  THAT I'M SARCASTIC!!!  Michael wants you to call him at 8:30.  Yeh, so $300 in makeup?  I just got some new stuff, but it was, like, a buck.  Yeh, thats my family for ya.  And, its rubbing off on me.    I don't like Dr. Phil.  He's too opinionated for me...that sounds so wrong...
