For example cud a 15 yr old have lived longer than a 60 yr old? it's probably possible because soem ppl in this world has gone through more than anyone ever has that they appear to have seen more in the world than 100 years could make others see.   anyways.. u can complain as much as u want bout the life u have and about things not goin ure way like i do but in the end if u really sit and disect everything thats goin on in ure life the truth is.. u cant do jack shit about any of it. live the life u have the best u can and in the end thats all that matters. I mean all of us anyone whose reading this rite now has prolly gone through shit enough shit alot of shit so much shit that its impossible to not gain anything out of it.
