I was in the process of "seeing where things went" with an ex of mine, and lo and behold this weekend the truth finally came out...I found out: a) he's dealing A LOT of weed  b) he's dealing oxicontin, darvocet, xanax and a myriad of other pills  c) he's crating engines (stealing for those of you not in the know) from cars for cash.   d) he's a major weed/shroom/pillhead and he is ALWAYS high or under the influence.  That is drama and bullshit I do NOT want any part of.  I feel so stupid because in my head and in my heart I've tried to justify everything.  I've said to myself that he was BETTER than he was before, but its just because I was foolish enough to believe all the LIES he was telling me.  I am a fool.  A huge, stupid, asshole of a fool.  I feel compelled to try and help him, but I can't have him in my life.  Too dramatic.  I don't want to be caught with him if/when he finally gets busted.    The thought crossed my mind about turning him in, but I'm too scared of him finding out it was me to do anything, he's a bit of a loose cannon.  This weekend he told me to "shut my fucking mouth before he smacked me."  I got in his face and screamed at him that if he ever so much as threatened to put a hand on me again I would call the cops and that I wasn't scared of having him arrested.  The truth is I was so scared of how he would react to me saying that.  But it ended it.  We parted as "normal" this weekend, but he doesn't know that I've shut him out.  Can't I ever just meet a normal guy?  What the fuck?
