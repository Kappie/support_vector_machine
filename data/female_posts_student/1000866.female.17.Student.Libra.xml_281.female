I don't really know what I'm going to write about because not much goes on in my life, well, not much that I really want to write in here so that everyone can read it. Ah, there is something. Kelly and I are going to go to the pet store on Saturday, and I'm going to buy a fishy!!! Kelly's lending me one of her many tanks. I never knew she liked fishes so much. That's really good to know actually...I think we'll have a great time. I miss hanging out with Kelly. Kelly C that is. I miss Kelly S too, but she wont be back til Sunday.  I kind of wish I were back in Caseville right now, I really miss it. Like...just right now. Most of the time I'm happy to be home, but it WAS a nice escape, I must admit. Caseville is like....ghetto Disney World. In Disney World, you never know what's going on in the real world. You don't watch the news...well, most people don't, but they try to make it that type of atmosphere where you don't even realize there is a world around you. Hehe...it's funny, I can't really feel my fingers much right now. My hands are so cold. Actually, I'M so cold. I should really close my window, and seeing as it's right next to me.....'eh, oh well. Is that laziness or what?? But, Caseville is like the ghetto Disney World, because you don't normally know what's going on in the real world, and you can escape, and just act goofy, and have a good time...while avoiding yokels. :)  Hmmm....what else? I actually talked to Chris on the phone today. Heh. Like, for more than five minutes. It was odd, I haven't talked to him on the phone since school since we've seen each other a lot over the summer. I'm going to miss him when he goes to camp. Gosh....I've had pretty good luck with guy best friends. I don't know why I'm thinking of this. It sort of reminds me of when I was friends with Andy. I feel terrible for Diane, and I think what he did was terrible, but I don't know. He was so easy to talk to and relate to. It's weird. Our friendship just ended so abruptly. Ah well. I don't think what he did to Diane was right, and I don't know if I'd really want to associate with someone who does that, but it still doesn't change that he was easy to talk to.   I'm just thinking of everyone I haven't talked to in so long...Amanda. I haven't even talked to her since she was diagnosed with cancer. They say they think she'll be alright, and...I didn't think I should mention it to her. According to my mom who heard from Amanda's mom, Amanda just sort of avoidied the conversation about it. I'm really glad Amanda's mom is one of my mom's best friends. I like to know how Amanda is. I feel like calling her, or IM'ing her sometimes, but it's weird. I think it would just be awkward.   Its odd how I'm thinking of all these people I haven't talked to in a long time. Like...Anna Krise. I wonder what happened to her. I wonder if she still goes to our school....actually, I could just go be sensible and look in the yearbook, yeah??  Well, I found her picture in the yearbook, so....obviously she still goes to our school. I wonder how many of those crazy rumors are true. I've known her so long. She didn't seem the type of little girl who would grow up to be suicidal. I suppose no little girls seem that way. I used to dislike her so much though. I always wanted to forget her when Kelly and I did stuff. I was such a mean kid. Actually, forget the past tense. I AM such a mean kid.   And then, what about Heather? Ah good old Heather, I wonder what happened to her. I mean, I know she still goes to my school and all, but I wonder if she started hanging out with better people yet. I hope so. She could do so much with herself. Like, seriously, I think she's incredibly smart, but she never seemed to show it. She always seemed to go with the wrong people.   The old daycare gang. And then David? Oh, I need to give David a call. I really miss him and his hugs since he moved to Georgia. I haven't talked to him in forever. :(   And then, finally, what happened to Nick Mascaro? I need to find someone who went to Kennedy who knows what happened to him. Him and his Blue bear. I really really miss him! He was always the sweetest kid. A little shy, and a little dorky, but so sweet. I wonder if anyone knows how I can get a hold of him or something. I don't want to ever forget him.   It's odd thinking how much I've changed as a kid. I probably still look the same haha. I'm even still really short!!! Maybe I'll never truly grow up. Maybe I'll stay a kid forever. But, I do want to go to college which isn't exactly a kid thing. I mean, I'm really quite happy with my life right now, but I'm also looking forward to meeting new people, and living on my own, and trying new things, and...I really think college will be fun. I don't think I'm going to continue with my music though. I really don't. Mr. Alstadt is like...convinced I will, but...I just don't love it enough to be a musician. Musicians have to truly love what they, because they have to stick with it even when it's not the best paying job. And all this makes me wonder, why do I do it now? I don't know really. I'm not looking forward to band camp really. It'll be so much work, and the only part of marching band I really like is the social part. Well, I do like marching sometimes, but I LOATHE band camp. So, why am I doing it?? I'm sure I'll find my answer once I get into the season and stuff.   Wow, I've written a lot tonight. Reminiscing and wondering. Ah, I think I shall truthfully go to bed now. Hopefully...   I'll probably stay awake and watch City Confidential. Haha. I'm SUCH a loser...but I like the show...  Sweet dreams...err....everyone in their right mind is asleep right now dreaming so....sweet dreams Catie! :)
