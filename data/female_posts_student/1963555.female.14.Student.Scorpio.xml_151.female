This may seem like a bad thing, but really, you're just holding others to the same high standards you hold yourself. And when somebody crosses you, they'd better be ready for a storm. You may be in the habit of keeping negative feelings bottled up inside you, brewing up to a bursting point. Are all those grudges really directed at who you think they are, or is it just bad energy trying to break out of you? Getting angry is a natural part of the grieving process, and if it will help you move on, anger can help you. Just remember to move on once you're done.     urlLink                                                                              What's Your Theme Song?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Mark Hoppus: You will marry Mark Hoppus, you are interested in someone who is completly understandible, and will cheer you up whenever you feel down. !CONGRADULATIONS!     urlLink * What Blink-182 Member are You Going To Marry? *     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        The Star.    urlLink   * What Tarot Card Do You Represent? * (INCOMPLETE!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
