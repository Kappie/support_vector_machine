You can't resurrect an imaginary character. . . especially after he's been sat on. ^_^  All right, kitten still uncaught.  Problem now is that I'm seriously afraid of two things: First, that I won't catch him before he turns feral/gets run over; Second, that if I do catch him he'll somehow end up with the name Toby.  He actually batted at my fingers last night, though, so we're making progress.  I guess.  Later all.
