Did eventually get it installed again, only to find the same problem... So what do I do? It's installed on my dads computer, but I rarely get on it as either one of my parents is on it, or my sister. I'd have to fight them to get on it. Silly computer.  Leanne called me today at like 11am. I was still sleepy so I just let it vibrate and ignored her. She called back later though. She's just got back from a week in Scarborough - fun. She blabbed on a bit, then went. She called back later to ask if I'd go to the doctors with her on Wednesday.  *Rolls eyes*  What am I, her mum? I'm not walking up there... It'll probably piss it down knowing my luck.  Anyway, most of my days are spent waiting for Jamie to come home from work and get online. I do actually count down the hours, sad as it is. Today he came on a little later because he had to go to the doctors, but my mum had put my computer on defrag anyway because of the trouble I've had with it lately.  Back to Jamie... I felt differently for him yesterday. Not sure why it happens, but some days I love him lots and other days I don't really feel anything for him. That's not to say I don't love him... I just don't feel anything, like everything is empty and I have no feelings at all. It's a little scary.  What else have I done today?  *Thinks*  Nothing... And what am I gonna do for the rest of the week?  Nothing...
