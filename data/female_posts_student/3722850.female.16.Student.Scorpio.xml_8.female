I'm gonna stay over and chill with her, then we have to wake up super early and get up on monday so we can go downtown so she can get her I.D.      emmmm i talked to anthony yesterday. he's been cool, but kinda nervous about the up coming school year at juarez, i told him that everything will be alright. > thats what i like about our friendship we believe in each other atthe worst moments in life.     laterz   Kris      3 's   Nick   07-24-04
