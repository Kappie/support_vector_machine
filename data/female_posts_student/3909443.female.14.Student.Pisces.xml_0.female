I am slugging through and I will certainly not finish by the end of the summer. I hate summer school, even if it does get those stupid half-credit courses out of the way... New fics: I have a HP/YGO fic titled, "Those Japanese Weirdoes" currently in the makings, but who knows when that will be up...-_-U   DeviantArt  : Stupid scanner won't work...   I mostly hang around GaiaOnline...
