Seriously, yesterday was the very first time I really can listen and pay attention during maths with minimal distraction.  Went to TP in the afternoon with Janice and Mandy..studed in the library till it close..Badminton at 5pm, TP sports hall..I only managed to do little stuff at TP cos I can't study outside..many pple plus distractions..so irritating.  Headed for TM after that..Went NTUC to buy fruits and bars. Then Janice didn't allow me to go home. So accompanied her to YAMAHA..she wanna buy a new guitar. Rich girl.
