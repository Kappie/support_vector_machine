I've not been writing about music, which is weird, because my whole life is dominated by the songs I know, the songs I can play, songs I wished I had written, songs that I wish I could play. Maybe I've been blocking all this out because my CDs and guitars are holed away in boy's house. Anyway, as poorly as I play, I do hope to start a band (indie?country? indie-country? - not much of this in Cambridge/Boston, I'm sure) in the fall. Anyway, this song keeps bouncin' 'round my head for various reasons. I saw it in a karaoke book a few weeks ago and was thinking, "This would be a really hard song to sing...Buckley's voice is all over the place in this one..." I can't even imagine anyone touching this one at The Local.  Last Goodbye (J. Buckley)  This is our last goodbye   I hate to feel the love between us die   But it's over   Just hear this and then I'll go :   you gave me more to live for,   more than you'll ever know.    This is our last embrace,   must I dream and always see your face   Why can't we overcome this wall   Baby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all.    Kiss me, please,   Kiss me   But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation   You know,   it makes me so angry 'cause I know that in time   I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye.    Did you say "no, this can't happen to me,"   and did you rush to the phone to call?   Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying,    "maybe... you didn't know him at all."    Well, the bells out in the church tower chime   Burning clues into this heart of mine   Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memory    Of her sighs that, "it's over... it's over..."
