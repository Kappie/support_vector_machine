"Yyyyydelekk, i think i have lice." as she scratches her dreads.    i'm not sure if i am a responsible enough adult to not freak out at those words.  distancing myself from her, i told her to go to the nurse. -- there are nearly-broken headphones in my computer lab.  everytime a child has a problem with their headphones, they want me to test them and make it all better. i can only test them by having them on my head.  -- kids love using headphones, be it to hear silly program sounds or to find their own sounds online.   plus they love sharing with me, where i'll usually feign enthusiastic interest.   sometimes this will involve the children thrusting their headphones at me.  --  i'm unsure of how exactly kids catch lice. (breebot, would you know?)  i'm terrified that they're crawling all over me trying to find a resting spot as i type.  i hope i'm just being a hypocondriac and scratching the bugs that aren't really there.
