Pretty much we just moved the oxidants to a new cupboard and moved the corrosives to the oxidant cupboard, while segregating the liquid corrosives from the solid ones.  Then Steve, Shannon, Tim and Sammi had loads of fun quenching a bubbler full of black sulfuric acid and other general acidic things, including about 7 bottles of acetic anhydride.  There was so much liquid that they put a 2L conical in a crate and added solid bicarb from the spills bucket and made a volcano.  They were having loads of fun :D
