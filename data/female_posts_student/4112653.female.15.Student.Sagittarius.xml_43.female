OK, i'm gonna try and get through this  one  by  one ...      ~ Markyfish is a   neeeerrrrrrrddddddddddddd     ~ I'm generally not too fussed about bible study groups, and I can see what point everyone's making. I really would miss u guys if i went to the college group, but since the yr12's are gonna be "university" ppl, that group WOULD be really small. Anywayz, it would be like old times in Sunday School :D *pictures James shouting at all of us telling us that we're wrong, and shudders* :S   ~ I was only half-serious about the last thing I said   ~ With Marky's #1, I didn't get it either, Von, ur not the only one. I think he's just trying to be a    neeeerrrrrrddddddddd   so just leave him alone      just a very old note, i think i AM going to the anniversary lunch this sunday      Who's the new Alex? Hmm... maybe I really   DO   have to start stretching the borders       ~ Lynn ^-^          pink !!
