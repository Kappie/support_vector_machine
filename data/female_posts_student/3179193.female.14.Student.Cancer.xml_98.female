Haha~! WAL-MART COMMERCIAL! [inside joke] Hahahaha! Funnyness! *grins stupidly* Haha! Hanging with Moca always makes my troubles go away~ Way cool dudee she is!   Sing the following with a very off-key country accent   This is a sad sad song... About the souls that don't belong...   *LmAozZ~!* Funnyness!  ROOFLES  Mad funny~ Hahahaha! So yeah... Damn, Moca sings great punkish-rockish-opera-ish-thingy-songs! Hee hee~! We turned the creepy latin  toe-E-ah thing into a cool gothy punky rock-ish song! MuahahahazZ~!
