J.H. can be really quiet, he reminds me a lot of you, Josh.  Gaddis (whose first name is Matt, I just always call him Gaddis) is a little wilder than those in your band.  J.H. would be a better fit I do believe, but he only plays acoustic, I think.  Gaddis can play like any instrument.  And then, if you want to teach me.... yeah, right.  Oh, and no school for me tomorrow.  Sorry yall.
