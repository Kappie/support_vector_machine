I saw the Chasing Dogma comic book you mentioned at this really cool comic book store in Berkeley called Comic Relief. Speaking of comic books, I saw Ghost World last night. It was funny. The character Enid sorta reminds me of Daria. The movie is speckled with oddball characters and chockful of sarcastic wit.
