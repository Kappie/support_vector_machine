Alone and Cold  in the dark  Drunk with fear and  pain and  hopelessness.  No one will come for you.  No one will hear you scream.  No one  ~  but me.  ~  All you’ve got.  I have everything you need  and all you have  is what I choose to give you.  Laid down  stripped down  tied down.  Feel  you’re powerless.  Laid open by  kisses and  caresses and  blades.  Relax, my love,  I mean you no harm.  All I want is  ~  everything  ~  I’ll be your Angel  I’ll be your vampyre  I’ll be your hell.  and You will love me for it.  ~  You are Mine.  ~  As you’ve bled me dry,  so I’ll bleed you.  ~  My kiss tastes of you.  Your skin  Your lips  Your blood  Your life.  ~  I will drink you down  and then  you will truly  never survive without me.  ~  Mine for eternity and always.  ~  I promise, I’ll take care of you.  ~  Come to my Elysian Fields,  my blood-soaked paradise  and you will want for nothing, my love.  ~  All I ask in return  ~  is you.  ~~~~    ~fin~    A/N: open to interpretation.
