Liz's computer is down, and wants people to know that she's not dead, but to please call her.  She's begging.  Now for me, well, I was on the phone with most of yall all day, so I don't have much to say, except that it was indeed a happy day.  One that I've been waiting for for a while now.  Everything is good, for the most part, I do believe.  If things go well.  Scott's supposed to call again tonight, so I'll know whether things from here out are going to be good or not.  Abby's at his house right now, so hope they're having fun.
