It will contain links to articles from various news sources, such as the Daily Iowan or New York Times.   The link above is to an article in the Daily Iowan (DI) about a night club that is planned to open up in the Old Capital Mall. The proposed club is going to be a cafe during the day and a venue for alcohol-free concerts and events at night. Check out the article and let us know what you think!  Comments, discussion and new posts are encouraged by everyone.    urlLink
