As I was in church this morning, there was this overwhelming feeling that came over me, actually, two. The first would be the sermon, which was on fathers, and our Eternal Father... How He is perfect. It made me reflect on the kind of man my dad is... One of a kind. He truly is one of the greatest men to walk this earth, and I think that may be why I'm still single. When you have a dad that is as awesome as mine is, it's hard to settle for anything less that... Loving, kind, compassionate, generous... He really is the best dad in the whole world.  The other feeling that came over me was the love and acceptance I have with my church family. As much as I miss my Dadoo and Mom-o and brothers... Not to mention the rest of my family, the feelings I had about not staying in this area for much longer, slowly dwindled away into the abyss. It also had to do with "my kids" at the church. They are all so lovable, and I don't know what I would do if I didn't have those kids to teach, love on and spend time with. To anyone who reads this, and doesn't work with kids... Start now! They will teach you so much about unconditional love and acceptance, not to mention how to be honest and laugh at yourself (yes Sam, I'm talking about you beautiful!). So there is my speel tonight. I hope all are doing well. May the Lord bless you and keep you in His love for eternity, I'm out...
