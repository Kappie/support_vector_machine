And every time I have come back since then, things just a bit less like my old childhood home.  So, now that this is potentially the last time I'll be in this house, I'm okay with it.  It's been a gradual change.  My youngest sister will have to do the fast ripping-off-of-the-band-aid shift in homes, but I got the...dissolvable stitches?  Does that analogy work?  Hmm...  Yay!  I'm in Portland.  I love Portland.  My friend  urlLink Susan  came along for the West Coast Tour, and I can't wait to show Portland off.  It is even sunny today!!!  Yesterday was a tiring day - up at 4:30 am, an hour and a half drive to the airport, layover in Minneapolis (I had not been in Minnesota since college graduation in 2000, so that was a bit poignant...for an airport...) and finally to Portland.  I got here at 1 pm Portland time, 4pm my body time.   But, for once, my luggage made it safely.  Of course, I took it all carry-on, so there wasn't much chance of them losing it, but I feel the need to celebrate that anyway.  I tend to have luggage problems.  Okay... things to do and fun to have!
