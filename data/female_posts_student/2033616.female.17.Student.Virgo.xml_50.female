Not a haven from the world, but the war's very trenches.  God help me I wish it wasn't this way.  Why isn't it different?  Why can't it return?  When will it stop hurting to look and see the shattered place that once was our home away from home.  What's the point in going back..  If it will only be worse the next time, and the next, and the next?  The Devil is at work here, and I'm afraid... he's winning.  I need Mona
