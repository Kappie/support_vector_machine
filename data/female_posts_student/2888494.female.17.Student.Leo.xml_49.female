I have long, beautiful, flawless legs (egoism! Huzzah! I'm not lying, though; My legs are probably my best asset, I kid you not.) they might as well be long, beautiful, tan, flawless legs. I went for a long jog yesterday, and I'm excited to get them in shape again.  I've decided against writing my thesis my paper. I shall endeavor to kill my skin instead.  I make so many bad choices when it comes to certain things.
