I'm thinking of going to Bryan's house to get it, but I'm also thinking I'm too lazy to do that. I might just wait until I see him next, which will probably be in the next few days. I've seen him a lot this summer. Too much if you ask me. jk, jk, lol...oh how I hate that phrase. That whole last sentence there was definitely meant to make Bryan annoyed. :) I'm not quite sure what to do with my day yet. I know I need to do my paper but, I don't know. It would feel weird doing the paper before 10:00 tonight. It'd seem so...unnaturual...   I really have nothing else to say right now. Maybe I'll come back with an interesting thought or anecdote, but in all likelihood...I wont.   Peace.   Hm, I was just thinking after I wrote, "peace," that that's a very Peter thing to say. I miss him, strange as that is...   So, I don't have Peter or even my cell phone who's the french peter. Aw, I miss Peter and Pierre. Bummer. :(
