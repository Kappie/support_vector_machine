The movie totally kicked..something. Doc Ock..is an awesome villian..and I loved the ending. I can't wait for number 3..but it doens't come out till' like 2007 :(. After that, I went to the REC because I was taking driving lessons..and my teacher was picking me up there. While I was waiting I chatted with Ian..about some stuff..I don't remember exactly what we talked about..haha. The lesson when good..I drove from Meadville to Mt. Hope..past my house...through Blooming Valley...to Saegertown..then to the REC. After that I waited for Rachael to take me home..but there was a lifeguard meeting...so I waited for like 20 minutes..but Ian and Kim my concession boss kept me company. Then when I got home..I watched I love the 90s... Today, I woke up around 10:30 and then when to my grandma's house with Rachael and Kyle. We ate at Porter's and then watched Days of Our Lives. Then I went home and a bunch of girls called for Kyle..haha. Then I when for my driving lesson, and it rained for most of my lesson..ahh. Then I when home and watched I love the 90s again. It's on a commerical break right now..so I type this really fast.  Tommorrow, I have to get my eyes checked at the eye doctor..then I'm heading to work. Alright, today wasn't so exiciting but aleast I wasn't bored!!
