Anyways, Good Morning World! Guess what? I had 4 large slices of Pizza last night for dinner and a slice of coffee creamed cake for desert. YUMMERS. Well actually it was my maid, Auntie Helen's birthday so she ordered Canadian pizza for my sisters and I. * Teehee * :D Talking about it now makes me really hungry.   Fiona, Jerms, Simon, Jess, Jiax and I went to  Sumo-Ya  for lunch yesterday. It's a Jap restaurant at Clementi-Empress, uber affordable and it serves delicious food! I'm not kidding! Set meals from $2.90 and it's incredibly filling, for me that it. I had Katsudon the other day and yesterday I tried something new, Curry Udon! YUMMY. Heh, it was awesome. Then we spent our time chilling there for a while before heading back to school to do Math on our own. I sms-ed Mrs Cutie T. Chua, her excellency, if she wanted lunch, and she said that Uncle Lee (Mr Lee) and her played truant, and have already gone  home sweet home . Haha! She's totally adorable... I kept all her SMS-es.. * OOoooh! * //Faints//. We went back to school and realised that Uncle Lee was still in the HOD office, in fact, he stayed back til' 5.30pm! Haha. I guess Mrs Chua received wrong info. Oops. Lol. She's still amusing anyways. Jerms and I went for tuition with Xavier (Hoong) and Lucas from 6pm-8pm. Wow, long long day!   I'm still alive. I love days like these! School, chilling out with mates, more work in school, and even more productive learning! At least I won't stone at home. I'm very prone to doing that. Ahhh ok, you know to much. Gotta go for breakfast with my family! Swimming.... and after that I'm meeting up with Martini and Jess for a movie. Keep it goin guys! * Smoooch! *
