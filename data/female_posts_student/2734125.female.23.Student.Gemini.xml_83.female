It is the story of our lives; we take things in, we put things out. It is a cycle, a truth. It is no wonder that breathing, breath, the motion of air in the world, and our bodies, has become such a magick and powerful thing. I have lately been able to tell when people forget to breath. Obviously (for the most part) they are still breathing in the physical O2 kind of way, but they have forgotten to breath in their hearts, in their souls, in their sex, and in their eyes. They just don't think about what they are pulling in, and what they are pushing out. They have forgotten to breath.  So I have taken the last month to begin my recovery, to breath, to wait for the next stage, the following step. It has been harder then I thought, but not too bad. Not too bad at all. Mostly I have been going to sleep old woman early, and waking up young child early, and feeling a little more whole because of this pattern.  It has awakened dreams again.  I dreampt I was visited by demons who stole a childs soul. He was a black wolf with star eyes whom I tamed, but when he ran he took the soul of one of my youths. I learned the ritual to retrieve it, and it had to be done by dawn. Many of the evil ones, not like the world wolf who was just obeying his nature, the evil ones try to hinder me, frighten me. None was a challenge, except maybe the time constraint. In the end, I called the child's true name across spirit planes and called him back, and then I awoke. Seeing the children who littered the dream at work today was a little disconcerting.  Its been a long time since I've written, and I fear that it will be a little more time tillI can begin the story I have for you in four parts. I have been shy of technology the last month. It feels like it just wants to pull apart and mess up everything that is floating in this box and out there in the either of computer land. Such a crazy web. I haven't felt totally safe there in a while. Its almost bedtime, and I offered my roommate and my parents dog a walk in the cool night.
