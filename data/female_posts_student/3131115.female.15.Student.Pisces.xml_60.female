It's not often..if ever that you tell me how you're really feeling..and I'm glad that you do in your posts. I love talking to you now..I mean, I know sometimes we get that akward minutes of nothingness...but the little conversations we have are worth it. I've been thinking about having you over, but I know that that can't happen...*sigh*  Bill told me lastnight that he doesn't love me anymore. I understand why he wouldnt. I mean..I'm always thinking of myself first. I dont know why that is.  He just called me, and told me to talk. I told him that I dont want to be with him anymore..  He's on..I'll continue later
