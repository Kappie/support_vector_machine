Wow quite fit, but i dint really think anything more at that moment. Eventually over the course of the night i got chatting a bit to him, but it was imposible to get him on his own. But found out that his name is C, he's 20, and studying Politics and french. The best way to decribe him is - you know the film Bring it on? Well C. looks like Cliff from the film! nice! he he and he drives an old volvo, but it all adds to his uniqueness.   Today i hoped he was working, but sadly no he wasnt. But he did decide to go for a swim, and wore little speedos with "Australia" printed on his arse! nice! lol i did perve quite a bit, but then had to swap with R. After that C. decided to sit in reception and mess with the computer a bit. Me, R. and T. started chatin about ginger babies, well R. and T. did, and they said how ugly they thaight they were, then C. jumped in saying something similar to "I think women with ginger hair are always beautiful" (yay) then the convo went on bla bla bla. But yey, soz im v.sad, but this kind of stuff excites me coz i have nothing else to do.  Also dad swaped my nice corsa for a shed of a peugeot 205. ITS SHAKES!!!! i'm so angry! it wasnt even his to start with, i payed for the  car , but dad seems to think he can swap it however he likes. My cd's were in the clio. Damn him! He goes on about little car's being death traps, and then he goes and gets me a shakey shed of an excuse for a car. Just becaus i've had theirs for over 2 weeks now, not letting them use it. But i was forced into buying the clio, and then found out that it over heated and needed over £150/£200 of work done to it. Silly man!!
