Or maybe I should just get one of you a job there. That would be neat. I work on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week so when I see the owner, Doug, I'll tell him to hire one of you because we seriously need some more help! Oh, Jillian Iannucci came in today to the drugstore like right before we closed with two of her aunts (they are SOOOO cool!!!) but Jill was telling me about her stalker! OMG, it's soo creepy, I feel bad for her. But that's what you get for giving people who follow you in Wal*Mart you phone number!! Crystal Spehar came in today, too. And I saw Alex Aiello  Melissa McMillan at Burger King. And I saw Travis driving (but I saw him 2 times last week). My sister saw Mark Bliss. I'm jealous :(. Tomorrow is our Open House. Look for my house in the classifieds of the Herald tomorrow, and the Detroit Freepress tomorrow and Sunday, I think. Dude, I hope we sell our house. It's not because of you guys, just because my entire family would  just be sooo much happier down there. Like, seriously. I'm just a city girl at heart. So, Yeah. Now for a few individuals (sorry if you don't get one, I'm very tired, it's 11:28PM and I had to work all day).      Kendra  : I work on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday...and Keri doesn't, so you should come up on one of the days (or more if you'd like) and we can get lunch or something. Oh and sure you can help my dye my hair blue! lol. Of  course  it turns guys on, why else would I do it?!?! lol!! Oh, and I hope I have a good time with Adam!! lol, and maybe he's shaved by now!!     Tara  : I really liked that annoying thing. Have you decided anything for your birthday?     Heather  : What are you doing for your birthday?   Later days guys. Have a good summer. CALL ME!!!
