This is a terrible thing to happen but he drank from morning till night for as long as I can remember.  I dont remember ever having a father before and nor do I ever think that I will.  He is very sick and we (my sister and I) found out that we are going to have to put him in a nursing home.  He is only 53 years old.  I want to tell everyone to put in your will that if you were to become mentally incompetent make sure that there is someone that you pick to do all of your financial business.  My sister and I feel like pulling all of our hair out because we do not know what to do?!  Well that was my fathers day.  See ya
