I'm off of school today.. so i'm tired and bored. kind of. i'm not really bored, but i am tired for sure. i might babysit for the scholls tonight, but if i don't i really hope i can go to spirit night with anto because apparantly someone is bringing her boyfriend alongwho we don't really think exists, and even if he does, we don't believe she's done the things she's said she's done... yeah. so if i went, i would have fun dancing with anto and stuff, and i could meet carolines date to homecoming which i'm not going to by the way because my mom won't let me date, which is really crazy, the not letting me go thing, because i'm just going to a dance with someone and dancing the slow songs with them, so i don't understand why my mom won't let me go dance with someone i do that at every party, and if i did get to go to spirit night tonight, then i could also meet andrew, antos stalker, again, and he's so interesting to look at cause he's wierd, and if i did go to spirit night, this would be the first time i've been out of the house for like 5 weekends. phew! RUN ON OR WHAT?! My mom cleaned my room for me, which was kind of sad in a way that i'm too irresponsible to clean my own filth. i feel even worse because my room is kind of getting messy again, so i feel terrible-er.  Mary's little post about bill is kind of gross... it reminds me of a story i'm writing right now for english for a story we're reading right now called don't lets go to the dogs tonight. i like it a lot actually, it is a very interesting book. it has a part in it about the author, and how she'd been praying for a little sister for so long, and she finally got a little sister, and her mom told her to watch over her, and this two year old baby wandered away and drowned in the lake, and her sister, the author, talks about what she looks like and its way depressing. so i wrote a narrativeish story to fill in the missing gap of what olivia, the girl who died, did and the process she went through to die... does that make sense? any requests asked, and i'll post it if you really really really want to read it... i'd better go, i've got an important business meeting to attend...
