Her book was translated into many different languages and had great sales. The book earned enough money enabling her to write another and continue the story. Since then, HARRY POTTER has been known worldwide and was so famous that director Chris Colombus decided to make movies based on her books. These movies were a great success, including the latest, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN directed by new director, Alfonso Cuaron. The next movie, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, is due to release next year(2005). More updates on that story as soon as possible.
