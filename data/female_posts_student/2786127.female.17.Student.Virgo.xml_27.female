I just hope everything turns out okay and nothing goes wrong (like..my makeup, which Genie and I are doing. Not that Genie would mess it up but me on the other hand...) and then theres always camping which I am also very skeptical about. Meh? I'm mostly just excited to get my hair done because i found the most awesome hairstyle on the internet that i really hope looks good on me. I'm excited about that and the dance the most, i can't wait to dance with my friends. eee!! excitingtastic.  I need to go paint my toenails before matt gets here, This is is my last blog until tommorow afternoon, I'll write then!
