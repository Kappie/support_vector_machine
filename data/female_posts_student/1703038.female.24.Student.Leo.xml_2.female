Which totally doesn't bother me that much, because I'm designed to be soft and curvy and comfortable.  The Mexican dishwashers at the restaurant where I used to work called me "La chica suave", and I was secretly proud of it even if Mexicans are disconcertingly fond of pasty white girls.  What bothers me is that jogging across campus to get to class is a big deal to me.  Moving fast will ultimately end in a lot of sweat and my inability to gasp out more than a few words in between recovery breaths.  Just from jogging.  Across campus.  Ugh.  A couple of years ago, after my stint at the Very Bad College and the resultant string of loser boyfriends, binge eating, and depression induced indolence, my body grew from endearing plumpness to alarming obesity.  A guy friend of mine got drunk one night and asked if I was "busting the deuce" yet.  I didn't know what he meant until I did my ritual scale check the next morning and stared as the needle quivered well over two hundred pounds.  I wanted to barf.  I think I would have, but back then I would have considered that an unnecessary waste of good food.  Instead I joined a gym and started eating Subways every day, just like that Jared Fogle guy.  And it totally worked, except I didn't become a thin Jewish man so much as an average sized white girl again.  The curves were still there.  They just weren't so...um...profound.  The most important part was the gym.  I started moving and perspiring and hurting myself a lot.  The big surprise was that I loved it.  I used to stare at Headline News for hours while I puffed away on the elliptical trainers and the treadmills.  At one point I even started running, or at least lumbering for about at a minute at a time.  It was torturous, but after the pains in my chest subsided I felt a wonderful glow for the rest of my workout.  Soon, I started adding time to my "runs" and my near death experiences moved from the beginning of the workout to the end.  The day that I actually ran a whole mile without stopping, I had to grab onto the rails to keep myself from throwing up my fists in triumph.  I felt like Forrest Gump.  One day I was a beached whale on a treadmill, the next I WAS RUNNIIIIING.  That was two years ago.  Since then, relationship complacency and lack of fundage for a gym has tipped my scale a little closer to dumpy than I'd like.  With the wedding coming up, my need to reduce the size of my ass and get rid of at least one of my chins has reached a fever pitch.  This time, I just can't seem to get started.  Before I met Jay, it didn't matter that the 1,200 calories I ate every day came from the exact same meal plan, but I gave in and began cooking real food after he started tearing up every time I pulled out salad fixings.  Likewise with the exercise...graduate students who are stupid enough to take twenty hours of classes don't leave themselves much time for personal activities.    Still, I want desperately to run.  I bought two books, a brand new super comfy pair of Saucony shoes, and I not only made a running schedule, but I started a running blog as well.  That was three months ago, and I haven't used ANY of it.  I'm not sure if I'm subconsciously reacting to how much it hurt before, how weird I looked when I caught my reflection in gym mirrors, or how much it sucked to see real runners effortlessly run circles around me on the track while I was still limping through my first lap.  I keep looking outside to see if these prairie winds will subside so I can at least make a try at it today, but I'll most likely watch E! True Hollywood Storys and paint my toenails.  Anyway, the Great Ass Reduction of 2004 has commenced, and if I get inspired in the next few hours to run, I'll let you know.
