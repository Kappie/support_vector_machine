Oh but go right ahead and grab my ass on your way to pass out....           David "If it weren't my weekend on..." Hill...for a variety of reasons at this point least of which is handcuffing me to the point where I have BRUISES!  (And not in the good way.)           My dogs...for being the reason that I am home rather than still out partying at 2:30 am           All the lightweights who were either (a) passed out or (b) throwing up by the time I got to the party at...oh 12:10...thanks once again to #2 on the shitlist...David.             Grumble grumble grumble.    But hey, at least I made a damn good dinner tonight.
