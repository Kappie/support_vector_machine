The doctor said that it was a stress headache. That I was just stressed and nervous about school. So he gave me this really strong medicine that made them go away. After I got used to school the headaches just stopped all together.       But now school starts in two days, and I'm not scared, or nervous, or stressed. And yet, the headaches are back. I really don't want to be in that kind of pain again, its not exactly pleasant and it makes it hard to focus on school work. Not that I couldn't focus on school with them, it was just harder and it Huuuuurts. *whines*      Kay I'm done now. Go and be happy you don't have headaches.
