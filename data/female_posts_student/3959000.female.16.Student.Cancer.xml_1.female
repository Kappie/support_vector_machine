She's only been gone a few days, but i already miss her a ton! So i've been hanging out with Jimmy and Tanner more lately. It's a good time, but they dont quite have the girl talk that kayt and i have. I'm definitely ready for it to be next Sunday so she'll be home. Today i went and set up my volunteering job. I get to go dance with old people tomorrow! I'm so excited lol. They're prolly going to think that im crazy and all that good stuff, but it should be good for me and them both. I hope that i can make some new friends... I'm sure that they all have some great stories to tell, they just need some peopleto talk to. The nursing home that im going to volunteer at is where my Grandma Marcuum lived before she died. Today when i was there a bunch of people remembered me from when i was a little kid and i used to go there and see grandma. It should be fun...
