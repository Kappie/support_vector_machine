This involved making a blog on an Aboriginal issue (quite boring and formal actually!!) ( visit my groups blog by clicking  urlLink here ) And also mi friend Mel has a blog, actually once i get her blog address from her I'm gonna link it here so you can all read about the little green dwarf that was actually Superman! FUN FUN!  Newayz...today I had cheerleading! Yay! I'll just blab on about this 4 a bit. Well, we met our coach and her name was Melissa and she had a really cool Canadian accent. We learnt a motion drill thingo and then a dance. We also practiced stunts, but that was bit boring and painful seeing as I had to be base and i didn't get to be flyer this week!(grr....) Sarah had a bit of trouble with the dance, but ya know...She'll get it in time.  OMG, I've got exams next week! Ahh...totally stressing, especially 4 French, French is nerveracking because you don't know exactly what they'll want u to do!! Mel and I r gonna study this weekend, and maybe Annie might come as well. I'm bludging going to my brothers' cycling this weekend as well! Mi god, its sooooo boring going to that, and it's all the way at Homebush as well. John (mi brothers coach) is here right now with Callum's new bike, its a surprise I think, its sposed to be really good, has like optic fibers or something, i dunno, i honestly couldn't care less about bikes and cycling, even though most of my family and uncles and cousins from my dad's side do!  Yesterday I went to mi ice-skating lessons (or maybe I'm sposed to call it "figure" skating...meh) and we had this really nice sub lady called Judy. She was REALLY sweet, at the end of the lesson she said  "raise your right hand in the air, put it on your right shoulder and pat your back, because you've done great this lesson!"  and she was a really good teacher too - i learnt how to do mi backward slalom, backward crossovers and backward two foot turn to forwards. At the end of the lesson she was teaching us how to draw pictures on this ice with our skates and we drew pineapples and Easter bunny's, and then i was just fiddling around and doing random things and then I did this weird thing with my foot and i like spun it round me or something and then suddenly she looks at me and goes  "oh my gosh, you just did a 3 inside foot turn, and that's like level 10!"  (and I'm in level 6) and I'm like cool, and then Gem and I were just doing the 3 thing and all these random cross things and we looked sooo impressive it was really cool!  Ugh! I've got Open Day tomoz! I've gotta do mi English blog thingo and mi French slideshow and that'll take like 2 hours. It'll be boring but at least mi friends will be there!! But Reynolds is making us wear our BLAZERS!!! Mi god, I  hate  Reynolds so much! But at least we get our Krispy Kreme doughnuts. I was gonna do gymnastics as well 4 Open Day, 'cept we have to wear our leotards so I scrapped that idea!  Wow, I've got cafe church this Sunday! Woo..I think Annie's gonna come, ya know you're sposed to invite friends and wateva. It'll be cool, there's coffee (haha - not that i like it anyway) and food (Casey was  very  pleased with that fact...hehe) and yeh...church is fun always neway...except now that a certain sum1 i think has been avoiding me...but neway, it'll probably all blow over soon.                                  ----------------    Salut, Je m'apelle Elizabeth.
