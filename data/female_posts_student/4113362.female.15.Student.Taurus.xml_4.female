This is my floor sleeping night. I've decided maybe I should stop telling everyone else they've changed and focus on the fact that I've changed...But maybe I haven't..maybe i'm just..I don't know. I'm so sorry to all of you, especially Shayne, for being so stupid and so immature and so hypocritical. I've become everything that I hate and I've treated you all like you're less than I am...I hate this whole week, and this whole day, and this whole hour and minute and second and everything I am now. I miss Ryan more than anyone could ever EVER imagine and I need him to come back now... I also miss Cody. Maybe I just miss having someone to talk to that doesn't fuck me over and we can have a long 6 hour phone conversation without being assholes to eachother. Ugh. I'm done.
