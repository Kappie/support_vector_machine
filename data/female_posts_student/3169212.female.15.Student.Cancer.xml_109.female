Force.     I regret to inform you all that Sarah has slipped into a trance enduced by an outdated movie.    It is not outdated! Everyone loves Star Wars! It's one of the best movies of all time!    She will unfortunately be in this trance for several hours, at best.    That's not a bad thing! I mean, for all the work it had to take to make all six movies...    *Clicks publish post*
