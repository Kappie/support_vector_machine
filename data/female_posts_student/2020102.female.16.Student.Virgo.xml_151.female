Salvation is here... -Dare You to Move ~ I wish I had what I needed To be on my own 'Cause I feel so defeated And I'm feeling alone  And it all seems so helpless And I have no plans I'm a plane in the sunset With nowhere to land  And all I see It could never make me happy And all my sand castles Spend their time collapsing  Let me know that You hear me Let me know Your touch Let me know that You love me And let that be enough -Let That Be Enough ~ Do me a favor Would you sing this to me slow? Cause I'm thinking it's my song Do me a favor Would you tell me when to let go? Cause I think I'm holding on Would you do it for me? Cause I'm playing for keeps -Playing For Keeps
