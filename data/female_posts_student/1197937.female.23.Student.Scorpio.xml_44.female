Interesting Fact of the Day: (from Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlossser) The McDonald's Corporation led the way in the standardization of America's retail environments, rigorously controlling the appearance of its restaurants inside and out.  During the late 1960s, McDonald's began to tear down the restaurants orginally designed by Richard McDonald, the buildings with golden arches atop their slanted roofs.  The new restaurants had brick walls and mansard roofs.  Worried about how customers might react to the switch, the McDonald's Corporation hired Louis Cheskin -- a prominent design consultant and psychologist -- to help ease the transition.  He argued against completely eliminating the golden arches, claiming they had great Freudian importance in the subconscious mind of consumers.  According to Cheskin, the golden arches resembled a pair of large breasts: "mother McDonald's breasts."  It made little sense to lose the appeal of that universal, and yet somehow all-American, symbolism.   gee, and all this time, i thought u guys were just going for the fries.
