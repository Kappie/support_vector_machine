My flight leaves at about 11:10 on Sunday morning Italian time, but then, I get home at 2:00 in Illinois, which is already 9:00 here. Plus, that's just when my flight gets in. I have to go through customs and get my luggage and get home and all that stuff too. I'm definitely not looking forward to that. I'm definitely going to miss it here, and this appartment. I really like it...well, except for the hard mattress on my bed. Oh my gosh, seriously...it's like a floor...oh well, it's ok. It'll just be nice to get into my own bed. Plus, I'm excited to see my friends and stuff. I took care of some Christmas preasants while I was here too, AND I found a hoodie. They're not big hoodie people over here but I managed to get one. I still need to get Bryans when I get home. Haha, I owe it to him for his birthday which was definitely two months ago. Ah well. All is good.   Today was a really fun day. I did stuff I did here last time, but it was still fun. I really wanted to do the Castle St. Angelo again and I got to. At night too, which made it even cooler. A little creepy...but still cool.   Yesterday and the day before that were fun. I went to the forrum, and the Vatican museum and shopped and all that good stuff. There was this really funny lady with a southern accent at the forrum who was coming from the bathrooms and she's like, "good luck gettin' in there. I think someone died in there." So yeah...I definitely decided to just hold it for a while.   Then, last night at dinner, we were eating outside since it was beautiful out and this crazy lady comes down the street yelling stuff in Italian. (Well, I guess the italian part makes sense seeing as I am in Italy.) So, we just kind of figured it was some crazy homeless person because, I mean, it's not like Naperville here. It's definitely the city. So, we look at her and realize she's wearing a fur coat. Haha, as Stephen put it, I guess she was a, "disgruntled rich person." I guess she wasn't a real nuissance though because the cop that was there just laughed at her.   I've read a lot more here than I expected too. I'm on my fifth book since I've left and all the books I've read up to now have been at least 300 pages a piece. Of course, the one trip I don't bring enough books for. I usually bring too many books on vacation. I guess I should go sleep now seeing as I want to get up really early tomorrow since it's my last day. :( I'm definitely going to miss it here...
