Complete non-hearing and owchie did it hurt! Yeay! Pointless blog! Erm, oh, wanted to say that I completely support putting the EAD races in with the able bodied races. Yeay! Any way, it stinks that they don't do that usually! So every one, pease, love and support the EAD races in the Commonwealth Games!
