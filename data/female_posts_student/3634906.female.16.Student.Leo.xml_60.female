Tracie came and picked me up... went to Angies... went to Dennys for breakfast... went to brookfield square to shop and blow $277.42... erp... thats a lot of freaking money... I wanted to vomit when I found out how much I spent... that's too much for all that I bought... 4 pairs of jeans... 4 t-shirts... 1 shelf bra... 1 sweatshirt... and 1 pair of sandles... I love the sandles... so comfy... and adorable... YAY!!! well yeah thats it... erp... and there was so many funny funny moments... but none that I can really write on here and any of you would appreciate... my family is rather weird... and I am not sure that you would find any of it funny and plus I am not a very good writer so I am not sure that I could do it justice... oh well... I am just going to leave on the note that I have tons of fun... and thank you to all of them because I bought lots and I love it all... nighty night       -gabby
