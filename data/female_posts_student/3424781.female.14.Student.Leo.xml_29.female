He says he wants 2 give me a week up there alone while Ardis finishes school applications or whatever or job applications. Well guess what dad. Ardis says he doesn't want 2 go 2 college  though he's filled out some job applications he won't get one until he returns. PLUS mom won't let me go up there until he gets tix 4 Ardie. sigh. *%$#@^*$%#$#$%!!!
