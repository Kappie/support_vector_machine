This is an analysis of a few articles we had to tackle.  ARTICLE ANALYSIS - GBH MELANIE BARNES  The issue of whether rave parties should be banned has been in circulating in the media because of recent overdoses on the illicit drug GBH at Two Tribes. Three articles that directly address this issue are “ We can’t rant about Raves “,  “ call for dance party ban rejected and “one in five try killer drug GBH” which were all published in the herald Sun the week following two tribes. In an article entitled “ We can’t rant about raves.” Jim Stynes argues that banning these major rave parties will only earn the Government a pat on the back and will stop us even prevent this problem from happening. He believes to attack the problem we need to focus on the reason people take these drugs, and what they need to gain motivation to live in their lives. To support this view Stynes points out that at rave parties there is medical care but at other smaller parties in which these people will be forced to attend in substitution of raves there is not, and time is everything with overdoses the medical attention provided could be a matter of life and death.  Stynes clearly supports rave parties. He says that he witnessed 20,000 people escaping their lives to come together and enjoy the music saying that raves are an almost tribal experience where people of varying backgrounds can feel a part of something greater, like they belong.  In separating the GBH problem from the rave party scent Jim Stynes does Stynes does not deny the problem of GBH needs to be dealt with. He makes it clear that the government needs to identify the real reasons young people are taking these drugs and take actions to tackle these problems. Stynes effectively argues that understanding the underlying issues in our young peoples lives is key. Saying that to adopt the approach of harm minimalisation, it is vital to understand what our young are thinking and feeling. He backs this up saying that it is inevitable that many young people will experiment with drugs but that those who do it on a regular basis must be missing something in their lives and that this is where we need to put our focus.  He states that it is not the time to hide from the problem. Stynes as the co-founder of the Reach Foundation has worked a lot with young people and obviously cares for their well-being. He has insight into the problems these young people have that cause them to resort to drugs. Thus resulting in him believing that we need to make sure young people healthy enough to make the right choices. In another contrasting article “ Call for dance party ban rejected” Christine Caulfield takes quite an apposing view. She presents the argument that rave parties encourage young people to take drugs. Caulfield uses the example of Mr Brooker who lost his best friend to drugs to demonstrate that there is a case to shut down these rave parties. What Caulfield fails to mention is that the people that suffer from drug overdose are a vast minority. Only 10 out of a massive 20,000 ravers suffered overdoses while the rest went about having a great night. In another article entitled “one in five try killer drug GHB” Patrick O’Neil and Christine Caulfield once again tackle this hotly debated issue. Despite the misleading headline the duo make a solid argument that shutting down rave parties would harbour devastating consequences as it would only drive the problem underground. To support these views they spoke to earth core coordinator Pip Darvall and the director of the harrowing dance drug movie “One Perfect day” Paul Currie. Pip darvall questions what happened to a draft version of “A Guide to running safe rave Parties” stating that running safe rave parties is a better solution is a better solution to shutting them down entirely. This article also aims to raise awareness in young people in the dangers of GBH, as does Paul Currie’s movie “One Perfect Day” Mr Currie said that the recent two tribes Speculation affirmed the films importance and he hoped it lifted the lid on what was really going on. The article also distributed some useful information about GBH. Although most people do know that GBH is a clear odourless liquid not many know that it is often distributed in clear sachets in a variety of bright colours to increase its appeal among young users. Paul Currie believes we need to bring all the facts into the limelight. Overall all the articles present strong views against the problems of drug use and concern about the impact of GBH. However they do have different views against what action needs to be taken to prevent further drug overdoses. I strongly believe that demonizing rave culture is not the answer and that no matter who may be right or wrong action needs to be taken.
