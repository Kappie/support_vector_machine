The dancing was the worst, running through your head like a broke- down movie. Their thin bodies jerked around like puppets on strings. We hid in the Windsor Mansions because they were afraid of them. Of course they were, those mansions had been their homes. They were the Windsor Children, once beautiful, once wealthy. All of the children were dubutants, scholars, athletes and prom kings and queens. Loved and despised, these angels had everything handed to them on a silver platter. And then the plague.  It started as a whisper, a mere rumor. Then one night it was breathing down your neck. It swept through the town of Windsor, killing the old and young, the sick and deranged. It left only the youngest and fittest, mutating them into something from hell. My family worked in a mansion, and we saw the disease coming so we hid. We hid in the deepest bowels of the house that only we the workers knew of. We hid as their once bronzed, toned bodies turned ash grey and limp. Their golden and raven curls fell out in thin patches. They ran around their castles  clawing their eyes out and frothing at the mouth. They ran around in splendor, knocking priceless vases and tearing countless paintings. Out into the roads they tore, horrible and gruesome monsters as a madness began to settle into them. And there we watched, the maids, butlers and gardeners who had know the inner workings of the houses and hid from the contamination that was induced from blood trading. I watched through cracks in the walls as the people I had waited on died of turned mad. It was a cruel sense of pleasure to watch them writhe, a grim satisfaction in being in charge and safe as the wealthy lost their once beautiful bodies and minds. After they left, we crept out from our hiding places, half- starved and scared mindless. The first morning we barricaded doors and windows, turning frantic as nightfall approached, for we all dreaded night. They always came out in the night, going God knows where when daylight broke. The first night was horrible. We sat there in a great dining room that had belonged to the McMasters. John, Debora and daughter Judy had dined there in splendor. That afternoon I had helped to burn the corpses ofJohn and Debora. Judy had been driven crazy, joining the others as the undead. We sat there, a group of ten maybe, huddled together bracing knives and bats. The sun melted, the room darkened and so did our spirits. My brother William sat up stiffly and flicked on a light.  The room filled with light and we could see clearly. That's when the singing began. We were a quiet, grim group until we heard singing off in the distance. We cast quick glances at one another, trying to ignore the horrible noise. Shrill, squealing voices like an out of turn piano. The voices came close to the house, louder and louder the shrillness became. I snuck a peak through the boarded up windows. Splashes of light crept through the boarded glass and allowed me to faintly see the outside landscape. There they were, dancing in circles in front of the house. Their bodies were sickly and thin, pale grays and whites. Their eyes glittered black, their entire pupil a deep tar color. They flaunted their decrepid bodies to one another, laughing at the moon and each other. Their laughter was horrible, deep and trembling, as if it had sprung from the devil itself. I spotted a girl I had waited upon, Lily. OUr eyes met at the same time and her mouth opened wide to reveal a mouth filled with fangs. Her lips curled back in a menacing smile and she began to slowly sing the lullaby I had once sung to her. "Lily my love, now you must sleep" Her body swayed slowly as she sang and her eyes glittered with cruel satisfaction. "Come out and play Meredith!" she called to me, thin arms beckoning.   *To be continued*
