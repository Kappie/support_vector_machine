Eric was already starting to discuss and plan the Phase 2 of the project. I was thinking "Hey, quite cool. Your really committed into your job." That really rest my mind abit. I was kinda relax and calm, seeing Yatie and Reny scheduling was perfect and fair. And Eric was already planning ahead, Pang was eager to complete his tasks. At this pace, there should not be any delays or problems.  Before the meeting, I was really thinking about the  on coming CA tests and the other projects. But since SCM's Part one project is almost done. Just leaving the ECOM part, I had been updating the Forum posting to my word doc. For the convenient of my other group members. If they don't mind, maybe that part could be included in the appendixes. Just to show, we did read everything. And the extra efforts we putted in.  My head still feels heavy and cloudy, body's okay, make up is even more okay. I think I looked great other than the head heaviness.
