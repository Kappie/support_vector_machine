I have almost completely (with the exception of Wine-Tasting Whichever Day We Pick That Week) stopped drinking on weekdays.  I catch myself checking the fiber content of breakfast cereals.  I curse the neighbors’ high schoolers who rev their engines after 9PM and play their rap “music” too loudly.  I gloriously and authoritatively put these rumors to rest this weekend, with two full days of patriotic debauchery.  Granted, it will take me another two full days to recover, but that’s a small price to pay to remind everyone—including myself—that I’m still a mere 23 years old.        The fun started Saturday afternoon, when I met up with Jaimee, Coby and Adrian at the Steakhouse for some wine tasting.  Michele joined us after her duties at Starbuck’s were finished, and I think the three of us managed to go through three bottles of wine before finally having to leave (two hours after the Steakhouse officially closed).  In our infinite wisdom, Michele and I decided that a few drinks at Scruffy’s were in order, and we proceeded farther and farther away from my house.  As always, good company was to be found at Scruff’s, and I’m pretty sure we closed it down (although we were not, fortunately, allowed to loiter for two hours post-closing).  Michele made the mistake of telling me she had never seen Tombstone, the greatest movie ever made, and so we spent the hours between 2:30-ish and 4 with Tombstone playing.  Finding ourselves to be the only people awake, we decided to retreat to my room for a few hours of sleep, only to find that Coby had already commandeered a spot on the floor.  This is odd, because he has his own room in our house.  But it worked out well, because Michele and I simply took over Coby’s bed, which is bigger than mine anyway.  After discussing the intricacies of various types of relationships, examining several mental/behavioral disorders, and realizing that the sun had risen quite a bit above the horizon, we fell asleep somewhere around 7.  At about 11, I took Michele to her car at the Steakhouse (where we happily noted that she was not the only person to have abandoned ship the night before!) and I returned to the house with high hopes of sleeping for much of the afternoon.  My more culinary friends dashed those hopes by appearing at our door around noon with several pounds of ribs, a watermelon that had been soaked in various types of liquor, and a keg.    I gave up on sleeping and embraced the fourth of July for what it is:  an excuse to drink excessively and set things on fire.  Oh, and to get too much sun, which is what we did.  About halfway through the evening, I absolutely had to take a nap, so I snuck into Jaimee’s room and crashed for a few hours.  I woke up just long enough to watch the Waco fireworks show (fireworks are my favorite part of the year) before going back to sleep, this time in my own room.  That’s right, I completed the trifecta, sleeping in each and every bed in my house within 24 hours.  So it’s not exactly the same as winning the Preakness, Belmont, and Kentucky Derby, but I was still pretty impressed with myself.   Today, Sabrina defends her thesis.  If it's possible to beat some of the times that we've had in the past for various celebrations (birthdays, seminar paper defenses, because it's Tuesday, etc.) tonight will be the time to do just that.  I've been torn between partying like it's 1776 and partying like Kennedys, so I've decided that tonight we're going to party like Kennedys in 1776.  Viva la Revolucion, and Teddy!
