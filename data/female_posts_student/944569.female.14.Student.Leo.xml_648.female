I quote all of the funny things we said:  " HEY EVERYBODY!  THE GUY/GIRL IN FRONT OF ME JUST FARTED!" " HEY EVERYBODY!  THE GUY/GIRL IN FRONT OF ME JUST SAID THEY WERE GAY/ LEZ!" "Of course you want to hit me, moron, but it is physically impossible for you.  You see, I'm a cartoon and I am actually somewhere else on the globe IN REALITY like in Alabama." "  How can you say she's hot?  She's just a cartoon.  I bet she's really ugly IN REALITY!"
