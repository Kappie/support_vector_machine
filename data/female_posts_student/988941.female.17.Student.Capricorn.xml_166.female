I love that program, the newer ones are better I think. Although the old ones are funny in the sense that the Pete characters says 'mate' an awful lot. Perhaps he is related to Mr Dicks? Talking of Mr Dicks him and Westy have taken all teh text bokos leaving Mr Bradwell or whatever his name is 2. LOL. How amusing.
