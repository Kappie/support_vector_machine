This one fortune-teller told my best friend that if she has beef/steak, she'll have bad luck. So all her life she hasn't had any steak or beef or any cow-related food. (Well maybe once or twice.) That's just missing out on the nice food.  My other friend (who is a very good violinist,) heard from a fortune-teller that if she goes to Europe, not only will she have get a major illness, she'll also fail to get her degree, and end up broke. So now she's not going to even think about going to Europe to study music.  It pisses me off, sometimes, these fortune-tellers. I mean yeah, I know they have no other life skill and probably need this to make money to live... But what they're doing... it's like ruining other people's lives. My friend here could be a very good violinist. And now, if she stays in Taiwan all her life... I doubt she'll get anywhere.  Oh, and she changed her name, too. 'Cos the fortune-teller told her that her name would bring her bad luck. So she changed her name.  What the fuck??
