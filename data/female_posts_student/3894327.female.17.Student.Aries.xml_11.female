Then when I finally manage to get login, I had completely forgotten what I was going to say. I however was not deterred by this set back. No, I went ahead and wrote a funny post about forgetting what I was going to say. And then guess what happened dear friends, my trusted bloggers, and lost internet explorers? This ridiculous site lost everything I just wrote. Isn't that just peachy? I don't mean nice peachy I mean little peach strings stuck in your teeth while the peach fuzz makes your face ich, but you can't scratch it since your hands and arms are covered in sticky peach juice. In short I have had a sucky hour and half. -Driel
