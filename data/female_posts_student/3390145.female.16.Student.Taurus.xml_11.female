"exscuse me did you take that purple ball that was in our yard yesterday?" and i said "yes because it is our ball" and she said "no it is not it is my friends ball" so i said "stop lying becasue it was our ball we threw it outside yesterday and you know you are lying" so she goes"shut up bitch it is my friends ball" so i go "stop lying!" and she says "no you ho!" so i said "whatever you know you are lying so fuck you!" and i started walking away and she said "no fuck you" and i just kept walking and about 3 mins later someone comes knocking on our door and they keep knocking for like 5 mins but i was not going to answer it without one of my parents home. i do not understand why little kids have such attitudes now! i mean this girl can not be older than nine and she is calling me a bitch!!!! i hate this place i really hope we can get out of here sooner rather that later...
