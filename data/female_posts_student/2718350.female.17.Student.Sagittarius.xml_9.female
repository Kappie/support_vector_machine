Always stop at dance studios and say "Hi im a dancer gone retarded can you please help me find my way to cheer/tumbling class?" 4.) don't show up a half hour late for your free class, it looks bad and makes you truly feel retarded. 5.) always have fun being lost for 40 minetes especially when you are getting pissed off and want to cry. 6.) be good to your car the poor thing never did anything to you and im sure concrete grass doesnt taste so good. 7.) even if your intention was to do something good for your health stop at Arbys and have some class A+ junk food. I promise you will feel better after you do like 9,000,000,000 crunches :)                                                So those are just some of many many rules of what not to do on you way to cheer class. So as i predicted  in my first entry today hangin out with clo certainly helped my mood i hope it will last. peace and love and crabs for everyone!
