I am 17 years old and I live somewhere in the U.S. I am going out with a really great guy that I love more then anything. We have been going out for the past year and he means the everything to me. (and for all those people that say that me and him aren't going to last you can just go to hell.) I have some really great friends that are always there for me in my times of need and they always know what to say to put a smile on my face no matter what. They are always there to talk to and they all know that I am here if they wanna/need someone to talk to or just someone to cheer them up. Kenny, Erin, Jess, Bobby, Matt, and Jessie are the greatest people on this earth, they all have there weird ways of acting and I love it. These are the people that I love and always will love.   There are some people that I hate and can't stand to be around but like it says above if I loved those people before I always will no matter what. If you know me really well you know who I am talking about. These people may have ruined something for me and I cant trust them anymore or doesn't respect my personal space, but if they try hard enough they may get my respect back and my friendship which would be great. I would love to be friends with these people again it just wouldn't be the same as it was before because deep down inside I will always no what they did and have that feeling but at least I will still have that friend.    Always remember that love lasts forever not matter how much you try to let that love go, deep down inside it will always be there!!
