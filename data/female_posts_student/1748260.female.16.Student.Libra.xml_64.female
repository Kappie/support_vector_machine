Yes.. my parents did not allow me to use my computer after coming back from church.. well this happens almost everytime.. Biasedness .. I juz hafta endure ..  Ya but I  failed to do so last night  flared up. I was suppose to check the directions for ITE Clementi  try to get there today. Sadly... looks like my plan's ruinned. And I wonder who wrote some crap in my shoutbox. Chatted to Sabrina (jie) yesterday on msn.. after about 1 month? Guess she must have enjoyed her tour around Europe. Michelle came for youth suddenly after disappearing for some time from youth. Desmond came back from travelling.. not sure where.. so he came for youth too..Now it just seems that everybody's sick. Me... I've caught flu I guess...People who are reading my blog, I have a special prayer request.. Pray that my appeal for the course will be successful? Thanks .. I believe God do miracles...
