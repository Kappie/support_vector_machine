Therefore, I have made the decision to finally get rid of this burden, my long hair. I've been thinking that i should cut it above my shoulder and donate the hair to...whatsitcalled? Some place where they use human hair to soak up the bad oil spills in the ocean. Yes, i like that. Saving the world while getting a haircut. So, hair above the shoulder. I'm still hesitating to cut my hair though. Will i look like an idiot with short hair? I was thinking about cutting it the same as Erene's.....
