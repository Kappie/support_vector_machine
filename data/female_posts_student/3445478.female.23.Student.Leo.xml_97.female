I don't think they have  ever  been as close as they are now. It's so cute.  We both miss Shawn right now. Keely's sleeping over tonight! Nick and Keely get along really well. She's entertaining him right now. Tomorrow Keely  I are finally going to see, Fahrenheit 9/11. I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I can't wait! Both Keely  I are huge Kerry supporters and we both want Bush out of office  4 years ago !
