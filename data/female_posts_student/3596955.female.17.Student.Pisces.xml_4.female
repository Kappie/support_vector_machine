And now I am awake =) and loving the freedom of time. Its all over. Yet retaining such freedom has paralyzed the concept of knowing what to do - cause I dont know what to do. It always turns out like this - longing for everything to be over  now that it is, you are at a standstill  dumbfounded as ever. I'll juss take it slow  savour the moment. I miss pokemon. *sigh  -- feelin great! --
