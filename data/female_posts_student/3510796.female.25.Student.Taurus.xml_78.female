Don't care to go into it now, because I haven't got the energy and I don't care to dredge up the way I've been feeling about things all over again.  Just need to move on, move forward, and focus on the important tasks at hand.  Did the radio station thing this morning, 7-11, before my 12-9 shift at the regular job.  The radio job is something that I truly love.  It's a hobby, something I do for fun that I just happen to get paid for.  If I could make a career in radio, I'd be just about as happy as I could be.  So, since the station is on a satellite feed with scheduled local breaks, we pre-record news, sports, weather, and traffic reports and feed them into the scheduling computer, which plays them at the right time just as we line them up.  So I write and record my sports report, schedule it for 9:12, the time comes for it to play and... it sounds like I'm broadcasting sports headlines out of a shitty drive-thru speaker at Taco Bell.  Immediately, the sound goes down, music comes up in its place, and my manager and I are trying to figure out what in the flying fuck just happened.  Check the file on the editing computer - sounds perfect, well as perfect as anything can sound that has to involve my voice.  Check it on the scheduling comp - hey, it sounds just fine there too.  So, I re-copy the report into the scheduler, play it at 9:50... and it's flawless.  Go figure.  The joys of technology.  That's it for me now.  Might touch on the other stuff some other time.  Right now though, I'd rather not think about it unless forced to.
