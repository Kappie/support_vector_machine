Giants score 1 in the 8th, 2 in the 9th, and then Matt Herges gives up 4 runs in the bottom of the ninths to blow the game. Tim Hirikkala gets the win (4-1), Herges the loss, homers by Todd Helton (18), Jeremy Burnitz (19), Preston Wilson (3), Durham (8), Cruz (2), Tucker (8), and Bonds (24).   A tough pill to swallow for sure.
