So he  told  me, "You need to clean those dishes." And I said "okay" because, you know, I was going to, just not at the exact moment he ordered me to, because after all, I am a somewhat-grown adult, not his obedient child orpersonal manservant.So after a while, Matt made a phone call in the other room, and underneath the sound of the TV I heard "I'm just sick of it... can't take it anymore... little things you notice... gonna have to sit down and talk to him... this week." Maybe it's a case of me just hearing what my ears are trained to hear, and what they want to interpret out of it,but it certainly sounded like the shit is about to hit the fan even worse, whenever he decides to sit me down and scold me like I'm a fucking student of his. When I get very stressed or extremely upset, the acid starts rising out of my stomach and burning like crazy in my throat. This doesn't happen to me over little or stupid things - er, at least not usually; let's not talk about last week. This only happens when it's something major or something that has built up and is ready to boil over. It got so bad at that moment I actually thought I was going to throw up.      Hopefully this is all just a case of my mind wandering too far off. I wasn't exactly in the best frame of mind before this little episode went down, anyway. But ifMatt decides to initiatea talk in the near future, this house is going to bear witness to a really bad scene, and I'm gonna need some more Pepcid.
