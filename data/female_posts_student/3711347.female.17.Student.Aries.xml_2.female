Cook,eat,eat watermelon,watch TV,talk to imran on the fon,clean the kitchen,log on to internet,sleep. Dat's wat i did yesterday,22 june 2004. Cooked a pot of porridge by demand from Ida,my younger sister. She wanna diet dats y! Then watched TV. Talked on the fon wif Imran. Fried french fries n chicken 4 both younger sis. Then log on to the internet. I'l b sleeping late. Always. Coz i cant sleep. Its been a boring holiday 4 me. yes. Very. I'm putting on weight. Gained 3KG alredi! Dat is a lot! Nvm,hopefully, when sch starts,i will slim down again! Hehe! Now then i realised dat i'm talking crapz! So I'm done.
