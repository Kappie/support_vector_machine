It's so funny, she's already invited at least four people to go shopping with her. She's somehow convinced Mr. Francis to have a cooking party at his house for his high school students. She's invited Joe Peeples to The Habit. When she finally rolls up the window (we're in the drive-thru line at In-N-Out and we see them after showcase)I ask her how she knows Joe and she giggles. "I don't," she says. She talks about Ken (and giggles) and prom dates. She tells everyone at Colburn that they did well, and they yell "You did too!" back. I just stand there, smiling. I feel like such a wallflower.  I know I'm antisocial, but today just brought it out in me. There's no way I can keep up with the vivacity of a person like Chika, who is a pathological giggler. She's nice to be around anyways, though. It's someone to stick around, along with Wendy. It's just the way I am, I suppose. I don't talk to people unless I know them well, which probably takes a lot of patience since I'm in no mood to expose my inner feelings usually. Really, I'm all right with that regularly. But maybe just not today.   I swear, after every dinner at Mandarin Wok there's that icky feeling in your mouth. I even skipped the fortune cookie today (but I opened it, and the slip said, "Soon you will be sitting on top of the world").  Will I? I'm ready.  I need to order plane tickets.
