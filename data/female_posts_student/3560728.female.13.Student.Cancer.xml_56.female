So I'm to be your canvas let you do what you want with me? Please go find yourself another fool who will fall for your charm and your perfect teeth and will pass her heart to you willingly so it can bew embroidered with lies in living colour red white and blue.  *    *    *    *    *  Lawlessness  The clock strikes midnight and sleep is disrupted we'll slip through the hallways candle in hand casting shadow that linger on the walls.  We'll break free from redundancy become a walking disaster ready to kill the shadows that stalk us wherever we go.  catastrophe, cateclysm (sp?), disorder Anarchy runs free tonight turmoil, chaos the laws that we so dutifully abide by have all been broken come midnight and we can't even remember our sins.
