A: Get a fifth old lady to yell "BINGO"  One evening, a family brought their frail, elderly mother to a nursing home and left her. Hoping that she would be well-cared for. The next morning, the nurses bathed her, fed her a tasty breakfast and set her in a chair at a window overlooking a lovely flower garden.  She seemed okay, but after a while, she slowly started to lean over sideways in her chair. Two attentive nurses immediately rushed up to catch her and straighten her up. Again, she seemed okay, but after a while, she started to tilt to the other side. The nurses rushed back, and once more moved her back upright. This went on all morning.  Later the family arrived to see how the old woman was adjusting to her new home. "So ma, how is it here? Are they treating you alright?" they inquired.  "They pretty nice here." she replied. "Except they won’t let me fart".
