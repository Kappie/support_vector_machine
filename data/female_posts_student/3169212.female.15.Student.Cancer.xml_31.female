Baka:  What have you been smoking?  It's pointed at my feet.      Cinni:  Those are some nice shoes, Baka.      Baka:  You're high on something, give the camera to Kurama.      Cinni:  No!      (Baka's feet walk toward the camera)      Baka:  Give it up!      Cinni:  Never!      (Camera is raised)      Baka:  No!  Cinni!      (Screen goes fuzzy)      ***      (Camera's on the tripod, by the way)      Baka:  So, you've picked up my cam...      (Tripod falls sideways)      Baka:  Not again.      (Screen goes fuzzy)      ***      (Kurama is holding the camera, he has to be sturdy)      Baka:  So, you've...      Is that thing on?      Yusuke:  Yes.      Baka:  I can't see the little red light.      Kurama:  It's on.      Baka:  Cut!      (Screen goes fuzzy again)      ***      (Baka and Kurama are standing in front of the camera drinking foamy cappuccinos)      Baka:  I'm telling you, Kurama, this could make it to America's Funniest Home Videos.      Kurama:  (Takes sip)  Perhaps you should consider sending this in when it's finished.      Yusuke:  Baka, we're rolling!      Baka:  Ah!  (Shoves Kurama out of the screen)  (Throws cappuccino to the side)      So, you've picked up my camera.      I hope you enjoy it.      Yusuke:  We got it.      Baka:  All right then.  Cut!  Print!  Moving on!      (Screen goes fuzzy)
