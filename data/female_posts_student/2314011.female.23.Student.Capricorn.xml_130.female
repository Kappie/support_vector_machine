The balancing technique applied this week has been foregoing the easy reading assignments until the hours before class.  It's worked thus far, but I'm not sure it has potential for long-term success.    In spite of that little hang-up, though, things are going remarkably well.  Not sure what it is about the new year/semester, but there's a tinge of (dare I say it?) purpose? challenge? that's lurking behind every case, brief, outline, note, lecture, always prodding, whispering.  This whole experiment called law school always carried with it the question: "Can I actually pull this off?"  That question led to a few sleepless nights and more than a few frantic late night/early morning pep-talks.  And much of last semester was about answering that question once and for all.  Now that the answer is clearly "yes," it seems to be time to see how far this little experiment can go.    As cheesy as it sounds, No Doubt got it right in the line "I ask myself: 'what good do you do?'."  The answer to that has always been an adventure and a half, even without law school's input.  It feels now, though, like I have a bit more leverage in the answer; always remembering that with great power comes great responsibility, of course.    So yes, this semester is going to be a mad-crazy, wild ride, only to be followed by ever more challenging ones that make this look smooth.  But all I have to decide is what to do with the time that's given to me, which might include using fewer pop-culture references in my entries.  And it might not.
