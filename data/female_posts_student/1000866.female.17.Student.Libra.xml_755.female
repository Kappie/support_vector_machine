My cousin had a baby...and, because we hate all those stupid distant relative things, Lauren said I could just be Aunt Catie. Hah. I can't wait to go see her!!       Sophia Katharine! This is her with my cousin Chris and his wife Erin. :)       I also have pictures from Great America and other random times that I borrowed from Diane.        This is my dear Fiance Matthew....A.K.A., Cookie Monster...       I think Matthew may be cheating on me with the Cookie Monster...       How DOES he do that??? What a crazy trick!!!       Haha...creepy pedophile Alex!!!       YaY Daffy! It took us a while to get this picture. The kids around us kept running up to him. Like on Wednesday when those two little girls totally schooled Matthew and stole his car.        Diane totally had a thing for Mr. Six. We didn't force her to do this at all..........but...hey, look how happy he looks!!    Well, I just got home from doing a bunch of stuff. I started doing this at like 8:00 and then...I got a call that saved me from an evening of boredome. Matthew and Jim called me and we hung out for a while and then Matthew had to go home, so I came home and was walking up my stairs and my mom was like, "So, are you in for the night now?" And I told her, "Well, I am if no one else calls." And...just as I said that, my phone rang and it was Diane!!    We went to downtown Naperville to bring Evan a shake from Steak 'N Shake and we sat on the riverwalk for a while waiting for him. It was fun. We talked lots. It was just a really fun evening and looking at all these pictures makes me really happy. I absolutely love all my friends. They're always there for me and they make high school so much better. I might actually be able to look back and say this was one of the best times of my life. That's saying a lot.       Well, I'm off to sleep. I have senior pictures tomorrow.  Nighty night kiddies. :)
