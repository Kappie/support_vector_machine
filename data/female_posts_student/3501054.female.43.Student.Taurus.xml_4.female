I managed to safely navagate the streets of San Pedro Sula, catch a bus to a small town in the mountains near the border of Guademala, and find my professor and fellow students with no address, no internet access, and NO ENGLISH! Ha!  Empowering time of life, I tell you! I am frankly surprised at how well I have done with the Spanish language .... although I very often get snickers...especially from the kids.... but the Hondurans are a warm and generous people who will do anything to help.... I will be attending mass tomorrow night, after finally getting to see the pyramid from which those artifacts and persons I have been working on were excavated. Very excited about that.  After living, working, eating, playing, sharing a single bathroom ...with 2 grad students and one professor... we are all already sick of each other.  And 3 more weeks to go. lol  We have a daily heavy downpour. I lost my umbrella when we went out drinking. HONDURAS HAS THE BIGGEST F...ING ANTS I HAVE EVER SEEN! AT LEAST AS BIG AS A VW BEETLE!  MOSQUITOS ARE LITTLE GUYS BUT CARRY MALARIA...SO LOTS OF BUG SPRAY DAILY. WE CALL IT PERFUME NOW.  FOUND A NEW DRINK...MANGO DAQUARI...YOU GOTTA TRY IT...WILL HAVE TO TRY TO DUPLICATE WHEN HOME. OH MY GOD WELL...IT IS POURING WORSE. MY STREET WILL BE A VAST DOWNHILL RIVER BEFORE I GET HOME. LOVE KISSES AND MISSING YOU ALL. GOD DO I MISS AIR CONDITIONING IN THE AFTERNOONS. NIGHT IS NOT BAD. BYE ---NEXT POST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE EV
