IT freakin SUCKS. Zack, Ryan, Robe, and Aimelyn have moved, Mark might be moving, Juan might be moving, Corey is moving next year.....*sigh* I HATE IT. I HAITE IT I HAITE IT I HAITE IT I HAITE IT I HAITE IT I HAITE IT I HAITE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I miss them so much...I wish they would come back. I hate this. I want them to come back. I miss them. Mainly Zack and Ryan. At least I have their phone number, and I can email them, and Zack has called...but i STILL MISS THEM....
