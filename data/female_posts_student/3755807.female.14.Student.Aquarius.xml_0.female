So I'll just ramble in here.    So, yeah. I'll introduce myself to..well I doubt anyone is reading this anyway but o well. I'm Aisys. I'm a very strange person. I'm obsessed with music such as Good Charlotte, Mest, NFG, AFI, Nirvana, Linkin Park, Switchfoot and some of that old country like George Jones. Music plays a huge role in my life. Normally when I'm down, I'll turn to my music. It keeps me from doing a lot of crazy shit. By some, I'm considered a "freak." By others I can be considered a great friend. Although freak fits more than often. Most people don't like me that much. I speak my mind and I'm very opinionated. I'm not afraid to tell people how I feel or to stand up for what I believe in. I'm very loyal to my friends, I'll stand up for them against anyone. I'm very emotional, too. I have my "moods" where I'm upset and depressed, I have those alot. Every so often, I'll have my hyper stages, they don't last too long. Unless I'm pissed off, or in one of those moods, I'm just in a blah state. I'm not really mad or upset or happy, just-blah. When I'm pissed off, I wouldn't recomment messing with me. I'm not a bitch. I am THE bitch.   Yeah..that's me. I can't think of anything to say but if I do later I'll put it up.
