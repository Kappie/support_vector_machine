I could just beam over to Mr Right and tell him what I feel.. flight tickets are so frickin expensive..   dahh.. whatever.. I guess I'll go to one of my classes now and pretend I was listening to the teacher while I'm wasting too many thoughts on Mr Right instead...   quotation of the day:  Taoism: Shit happens.  Protestantism: Let shit happen to someone else.
