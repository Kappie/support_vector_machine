It took major balls (in a matter of speaking) to do what you did.  It takes even bigger balls to tell the truth and then also such verbal blows.  Major props!  I am glad that is off your chest and now onto bigger and better things. Also, maybe I shouldn't say this either, but I never really liked JJ.  The first time I met him I introduced myself he looked at me and laughed.  What a prick, I thought maybe I was wrong...  I wasn't. GO VAL!!!
