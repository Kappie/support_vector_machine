Ah well, sometimes that happens. Friday night i hope me and sarah can go somewhere together. Thursday, i get to see sarah, which is good. She's been in chicago all day today. I hope she's been having fun. We're doing great, very much in love, and the relationship is still going very strong. Anyway..  School: -      Very boring today actually. I probably just missed sarah.  -      English, we finished in The Importance Of Being Earnest -      Pre-cal... he's been annoying by taking up homework every day, but that's okay =) I at least had its done, so its quite alright -      Chemistry! We have so much work to do on that exam review, i'll do it though -      My study halls were boring today, but good  Okay basically that's all about school. I just am really bored right now. I miss sarah desperately and can't wait until she gets home. Plus i'm watching a depressing show, haha. I just, i don't know, i'm kind of blank right now. Oh, and I am taking AP Chemistry now, but if there's too much work at first interim, i'm going to drop. I'll post some more later i suppose. I hope everyone had a good wednesday. two more days.  bye
