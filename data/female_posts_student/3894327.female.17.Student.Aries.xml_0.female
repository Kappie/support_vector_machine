IN the ads I Robot appeared to barely rise above the 'so bad it's funny' mark. The movie however was a little better then that. It was full of holes, lose ends, and some rather random senses that didn't quite fit, but it was still fairly enjoyable. I'd give it a B-.    Now on to bigger and better things. Wait..... I've got nothing else to say. Bye    -Driel
