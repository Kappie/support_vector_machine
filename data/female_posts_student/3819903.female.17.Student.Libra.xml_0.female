Drove the brother and I to the pool, so he could tan his white neck, and play with our cousins.  So when we arrived at my grandma's house, my rich aunt Margaret had brought over some tennis contraption.  It would shoot balls out and you would return them in to the net provided.  So I take a try, and granted, I have played tennis for only two years, and that was 3rd and 4th grade!  So I take my Softball induced swing and smack the ball into the net! The first couple of times I hit the net right on...then the control was lost, I started hitting them over the net, to the side of the net...My grandma's Leg.  Yeah, swung really hard, and she was coming around the corner of the house at just the right time, that the line drive hit her in the calf/shin.  So I immediately felt like shit, and her leg was already starting to swell and bruise.  To make it worse she had had two other bruises there before and they were almost gone...until I hit them...and made one BIG bruise.  So, in the end, the joke was passed around that I was going to be taken out of the will, and forbidden from playing tennis ever again!  So, I went in the pool, got some sun...then had to report to work...because Nikki had to go up north!? Ok, 2.1 hours of work, that beats my previous record!  So worked with NB, and was lazy of course.  After Hell--we all decided that a nice competitive game of mini-golf was the ticket!  Teammates: Kaitlyn, Nicole, Kevin, Abby, Amanda, Greg, Sam, and Amanda's Sister Rachel and her friend Jen.  So the innocent, yet competitive game of  Putt-Putt,  went pretty slow, we had a nice line of people forming behind us!  So, after the par 50 round of 18, the standings went as followed: Kaitlyn (44); Abby, Amanda (53); Kevin, Greg (55); Sam (57); Rachel (59); Nicole (60); Jen (62).  I had 2 hole-in-ones!  I got lucky alot too!  But it was a really fun night in the first place! We also hit up the batting cages too!  I tired the fast-pitch cage 3 times--with really bad results.  I think I hit 15 out of 36 balls possible!  I couldn't hit those at all!  The bats were also ridiculous as well, they were really heavy, and really stiff!  Oh well!?  Hurt my wrist in the process though! Ouch!   After our fun filled night--we headed on over to Abigail's House to continue the fun by watching some Animal House!  Classic Comedy!  Wow, definitley need to have that in my college DVD collection!  So, I decided that it was time to retreat to my bed, and get ready for my medieval sunday!  Nicole, Me and some other people are heading to the Bristol Renaissance Faire!  Can't wait to see some hot guys joust!  I am for it!  Or all of the "peasants" kissing my feet becuase I'm beautiful!  haha So it should be a great day, and most likely will be getting a great tan!  So that should be an interesting blog for tomorrow!  ;-)
