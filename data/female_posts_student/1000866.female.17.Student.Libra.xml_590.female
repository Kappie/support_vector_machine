I hung out with Katharine a lot. That was cool since i don't get to hang out with her much. A lot of hanging out with Bryan and Scott too so that was really cool. Bryan and I have started to talk more this semester since we're in W.E.W. together. It's cool...not even at all awkward anymore. Good times, good times. So, the clinician was either really really nice or we actually did alright. I'm hoping it's the latter of the two but...doubtful. I almost wish we wouldn't have played Hoe Down, although it is a kick butt song. Oh well. We did go to McDonald's for lunch. Shock shock but it was right near Pizza Hut so we decided to go there instead. Yum.   I drove myself to school today too. That wasn't bad...except for that cop following me....and then I was kind of freaking out and..yeah. Oh well. It's cool.   I can't decide on whether or not to go to mass tomorrow morning or if I just want to wait until tomorrow night. I'm thinking tomorrow night.   I'm in a writing mood but there's nothing to write about. You'd think I'd be sensible and use my writing mood for my Cause/Effect paper but...nah. I'm just not that intelligent. Ah well, such is life.   I'm so excited. I was watching American Idol and the guy was talking about a special that will be on Monday night and William Hung is going to be on it!!! That's AWESOME. That guy is amazing. Haha. It's kind of ironic how he'll probably be mroe famous than the person who actually wins. I mean, "She Bangs" is a pretty catchy tune. Ah, good old Ricky.   I think I'll be done for now and go finish sorting my laundry. Yes...and maybe study for my psych test. doubtful but...eh, you never know.
