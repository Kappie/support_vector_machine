On Feb. 7, less than a week from now, it will be six months to the day that I had my vitrectomy and everything I had been working towards and everything that I had been expecting to happen ground to a halt.  At that moment I had nothing to work towards, no expectations, no hope because I didn't know what the situation would be.  Nobody did for about a month after that.  I never could have thought then that I would be back doing the same thing, reading, reading and reading some more with my apparently fragile eyes.    My eye is stronger than I thought.  I can read for much longer periods of time, although I still prefer to look at something on a computer rather than stare at a sheet of paper.  I can't explain why that is really, except that I think it might have something to do with the knowledge that I can enlarge it at will if I can't see it (not always possible with printed text.)  I paced myself so much for a long time that I thought I was only capable of reading a few pages every hour.  Now I'm devouring half a book a day.    Been reading Northrop Frye and Robertson Davies.  Might as well pick up some Canadian literature and heritage along the winding road that is my dissertation.  Frye is quite cynical whereas Davies is amusing in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way.  I much prefer Davies' works but I have to venture broader.    Wiarton Willie saw his shadow today.  Six more weeks of cold and snow.  I don't know what his prediction was last year but I recall the snow and ice carried on at least until April 4.  Not fun.  Well, we know things will be wrapping up within the next 12 weeks.  I don't know about six!  Speaking of winter, we're anticipating another significant snow event overnight and into tomorrow.  Why does that always happen on the days I have to walk 20-25 minutes to volunteer?  The first two weeks were arcticly cold -30C, last week was a significant snow day (actually closed the university Monday  Tuesday night) and tomorrow is supposed to be the same.  I'm getting tired of working so hard to get there!   Oh ye winter freezes and gentle snowfalls, piss off already.  More to come...
