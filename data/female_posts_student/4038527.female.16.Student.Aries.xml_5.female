Was having PMS... and didn't feel that anyone would want to witness me spilling my guts here and risk getting clawed at :D.   Oral  I got an A2 on the dot in spite of me feeling so wretched on the day of the exam thinking that I would get a meiocre mark for sure because for once, I was baffled, unable to say anything on the very moment when people actually expect me to.   Ps. I really need to get back to the html world asap. I didn't even know when people start using 'strong' and 'em' instead of 'b' and 'i' for bold and italic respectively. Or... has it always been that way?
