You prefer the inner values. There is one danger to this: you might judge all flashy people for being superficial and develop a certain aversion for these people. The first impression counts and the outward appearance is an important factor. You should consider that some people get more self-esteem by putting more value on their looks. Maybe you could also try a new outfit and see how you feel then.
