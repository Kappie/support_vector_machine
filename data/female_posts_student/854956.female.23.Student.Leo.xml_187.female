Then Saturday I woke up early and looked over notes and such for my lab midterm.  I'm not quite sure how I did on that... :-\  No turning back now... I think I totally messed up my density one, because I don't know if he'll accept the way I converted my millimeters to centimeters.  Oh well...  I left campus and rushed home to change for Daughn's bridal shower.  My Mom and I left and got there right on time.  We had a nice time visiting with everyone who was there, and hearing all about how Daughn and Damian met... and then hearing Dori tell us about Deena and her fiancee and how everything's going with that.  So, it was nice.  Daughn got a LOT of stuff for her kitchen, and so everyone was joking with her that she needed to start cooking.  She joked back that she would make hot dogs and mac and cheese.  It was fun stuff and good times.  Then I came home and snacked on some chips and salsa because the only thing I had eaten was the little bit of refreshments at the shower.  :-(  Veggies, cheese/crackers, and a piece of cake just don't go that far, ya know?  So... whilst I was eating my chips and salsa, Melissa called and asked if I wanted to come over to eat dinner with them.  I told her to give me a few minutes to figure out what was going on at my house.  My Dad finally got home from cleaning up stuff around the church (Next month is the 100th anniversary, or something... and there's to be a fairly large barbeque) and ran to get he and my Mom some dinner from KFC.  So, I dropped it off and headed over to Melissa's.  We hung out around there and watched some tv while her parents went to buy stuff to make chicken fettucini alfredo.  YUM!  It was delicious!!!  We then left after dinner and desert (all of which was awesome) and Melissa, Brandon and I went to see  urlLink 50 First Dates , the new Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore effort.  I LOVED it!  It was so cute, and was just precious!  And I have also decided to buy the soundtrack, because it had wonderful reggae/Hawaiian influenced remakes that I NEED for the summer!  :-)  Afterwards, we decided to go to the Krispy Kreme on Austin Hwy (yes, unfortunately for me that makes 2 consecutive weekends!!!) and so I indulged myself in a frozen chocolate coffee drink and one original doughnut.  Then we went over to Wal-Mart because Melissa needed a few things before she goes to Utah for a skiing trip during Spring Break.  We also decided to buy tie-dyed shirts for DMB this summer... it'll be fun stuff!  :-)  Are you hating on me?  Cause if you are, I think you need to GET OFF THIS!!!!!!!  ;)  This has become Brandon's new bad-ass catchphrase.  It's great... it's Al Pacino meets Tony Soprano.  ;)  Anyhow... we then went back to Melissa's so I could get my car and all... and I bid adieu to Melissa until next time... of which I have no idea when that will be.  BUT, I had a WONDERFUL time catching up with her and hanging out... (this is the first I've seen of her since this semester began)...  That's all... I'm done... I've typed a LOT... and I have yet to do all my laundry and such for the week.
