After school I got my hair cut so it looks nice again. Now I need to learn to blow dry it straight(if anyone wants to teach me how I would be appreciative). On Saturday I worked all day which is 7.30 till 5.30 in North Sydney. Hello 6 am starts. That night the parentals went to the A.F.L so I was left to baby-sit the little bro, which was ok he wasn't too bad. We ordered pizza and watched movies. The highlight of the evening was a call from leah. She called from Airlie beach and it was great to speak to her. On Sunday I went shopping and to the movies with my Mum. It Was a fantastic day. We saw The Prince  Me which is a really good movie and I recommend it to everyone(even boys). I Bought Two new pairs of Jeans and two tops which was good. The Rest of my holidays have been sitting on my arse all day bored out of my brains and having to watch daytime TV. ARRGH!!  Somebody Save Me From Going Insane!! Luv Dee
