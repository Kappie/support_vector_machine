I don't know if he is serious, but I hope that he is! That would be awesome. Ellen wanted to do it when we turned 18, but I really can't wait. I have been thinking about it sooo much. I really wanted a tatoo, too, but I can't get that for sure. That would be sooo much harder to get and soo much more permanent. Plus, belly button rings are so much fun. ;)   Sometimes Brian confuses teh heck outta me LOL. I can never tell what he is thinking which is weird because I am pretty good at reading guys. He is not the most romantic guy ever -- ok not at all -- but he is super cute. Sometimes I doubt that he likes me, but then he text-messaegs me or calls me at the most random times with nothing to talk about just because he wanted to say hi. He'll tell me about his day or somethign at work and ask what I'm up to... Yeah he is freaking adorable. We have been going out for only a little over 2 weeks. It seems like it has been forever, but at the same time, it has not been that long at all. I don't get to see him very often because he goes to Taylor and I go to Cinco and all, but I talk to him every day. He is such a kid, and so outgoing, and so carefree, and just goes with the flow of things. He will never look at you when you do something stupid and say "that was really dumb" he'll just play along and act all stupid with you. Haha I will probably look back on this like I look back on my Hunter stuff -- disgusted that I could be so infatuated with one guy. But somehow this is a little bit different because I am actually going out with him instead of the stupid friends with benefits mistake that I made before.   I have been talking to Dani about her belly button ring because this is what started this whole thing. I am scared as shit because I think that it is going to hurt, but she says that it is just like a pinch and then it is over. She says that the worst part is being scared beforehand. I know that my parents won't find out about it because they never see me without a shirt or anything. Until the summer atleast... But, even then, they don't see me in a bathing suit that much. The only problem would be if we went on vacation, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it. :)   Shit shit so much homework, but mostly studying: HW notebook for chemistry class, study for chemistry class   Hmm I love this LJ thing because I talk waayy too much and no one else wants to hear about it LOL   Oooh and one more thing! I got some kick-ass new shoes from Old Navy. One pair of sort of plain white flip flops and this other pair of shoes that are wood with straps across the top of my toes with a buckle. Very adorable! Yay!
