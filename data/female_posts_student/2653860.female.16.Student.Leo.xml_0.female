So I had a total of 4 periods today. So the day went really fast. I didn't get to go to the career center.   Cassie, I still can't believe that they rescheduled the AC Tournament for next Saturday!! How stupid can they get? I mean how many schools do they expect to show up at this thing? Aren't all the schools doing Solo and Ensemble? I really wanted to do the tournament!! I am so mad!! Sorry, that was my little rant. I am all better now.
