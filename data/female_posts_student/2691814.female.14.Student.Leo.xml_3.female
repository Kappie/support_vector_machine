I really think Ryan gave me his cold since he came back to school the other day. Also one of my other friends had pink eye yester day and i am very scared cuz i've had that 2wice in my life. Illnesses are just attracted to me i guess lol. I'm always sick or something. Always need to go to the hospital or get a shot or something. But anyway, yesterday at chorus we were practicing infront of mrs.brown and we did so much better than ever before! yay for us. Lets see....Friday-SAA and grandparents coming and Saturday-going to the golf thing at the convention center.(My family is big on golf...not me even tho i was told i have a very strong hitting arm lol) ya dad taught me and my brother how to play but I think my brother picked it up more since he's been in tournoments(can't spell) I don't care for it. But anyway I guess i'll post later if im not asleep or throwing up lol.
