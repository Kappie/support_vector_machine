Actually, it  is  homsexual (I'm sorry, Abby! heheh). But she's blaring away upstairs, and has been fo-eva, fo sho, at least all weekend, and all week. So I'm pretty much a Kelly Clarkson aficionado at this point.    Ok, that last line really scared me. I'm going to purge this vile sin of pop music from my veins now. And now that really whorish "I Wanna Be Bad" song is playing.  Life with a 14-year-old diva aspirant est tres bad.  Thisall post was entirely irrelevent and not intended to have any meaning past killing braincells (a lot, I'm thinking). I don't even know why I'm making it, come to think of it. I don't know why I'm still making it.  O, yeh. It was the Cherry Cokes from earlier. HAHAHAHA.   Irrelevently yours. And sorry to those of you who are sitting there going "umm..."/all of you!
