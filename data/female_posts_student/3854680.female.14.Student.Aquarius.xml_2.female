Andrew, I'll make an attempt to call you if my sister allows it (it would be her cellphone, if it was going to happen). If I don't, I apologize greatly. You always have Emily to call (although, when you're gone, I just deal with it and don't call anybody..^_~).  Deanna, if you're reading this, the post underneath this is Clay. Quit freaking out going, "SHE LIED TO ME! SHE BROKE THE PROMISE!!"  ..I didn't.   TALK TO YOU ALL IN A WEEK!  *MUAH!*
