They had strung a bunch of yellow caution tape up all over the campground so we wouldn't get in the performance's way. Well, we didn't pay attention, and sat on the other side of it anyways. Bryan was sitting next to me, and he was cool...until two middle-school girls sat down maybe ten feet away from us. One of them has a cell phone. Her cell phone rings, and Bryan goes crazy. She's standing like right IN FRONT of us talking, and Bryan's going: "I don't want to hear your conversation. You know that? I really don't. No one cares about you that much. Get over it; you're not that important! Quit talking will you? You're camping. Get it? CAMPING. You don't need a cell phone when camping in the middle of the woods of New York!"  Of course, we ran into her again later, and she thus acquired the nickname of "Cell Phone Girl".  Now, this was a very primitive camp for most of the corps. An outdoor shower, the water controlled from the kitchen, was our only means of cleaning ourselves, and there were no mirrors to be found in the whole camp ground. Fortunately, our life saver, Mrs. P (Lindsay's mom)had a mirror in the trunk of her car.   As for the drumming, WOW. I actually didn't screw up the on-stand performance, especially considering that i learned half the songs we played in about ten minutes beforehand. I did, however, play the wrong strain of Whup Jamboree in the midgetly short parade. I'm serious, we could see the end of the parade from the beginning of it. We were, of course, 17th out of a list of 20 corps...so it took a while. You have no idea how many people gave us a standing ovation and came up to us afterwards, saying that we were the best group they'd ever seen, and telling their kids that we were better than their OWN corps, kinda odd...  Well, Jello. For those of you who aren't familiar with the game of Jello, it's when you take off your seat belts on a car ride (only bench seats work) and smash against the other two people on the varying curves. The entire two-hour ride back from Carmel, we played a very enjoyable game of Jello. Of course, only the drummers (myself, Emily, and Bryan) were involved; the fyfers were talking about getting naked in the back. I had the door side, Bryan had the middle, and Emily had the window side. Now, you have to understand, Emily's tiny. The combined effort of Bryan (6'4) and myself knocked the wind out of her every time. Of course, I kept getting wedged between the seat and the door. The recruits were cheering on emily and I, and were truly afraid for our well-being. "Emily, put your pillow up; we're going to the left!" "April, quick! Put your pillow on the door and lock the door, we're turning right!" It was rather cute. La'ers, April
