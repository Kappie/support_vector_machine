I know I seem to be obsessed with it, but dammit, you just try to quit and find that smoking was pretty much the only thing you were doing all day long. You only know this when you stop doing it. I've been replacing one addiction with another unintentionally. From  nicodemon  to The Sims. I must say that I found SimCity, and even SimTower much more interesting and fun than The Sims. But it's good enough to get me hooked. I'm sitting here aching as usual since I quit. Maybe the game will take away some of my pain?  To fill the empty void in my days, I've also been buying a whole bunch of VCDs. Some movies I've seen:   Windtalkers:  ack! What shit is this? I was ready for a good old war movie. Hell, I was even expecting European war. I had no clue it was about the Pacific war. Who the hell cares. Nicholas Cage cannot act. I must scream this little factoid from the top of my lungs, so that nobody will ever fall into the trap Hollywood and the capitalists have set for us to make us believe that this man can, in fact, act. I suppose staring with an empty look in your eyes (like Droopy, that dog, or whatever it is, from the cartoons) and your mouth half-open is called acting. Only thing we need now to make our jaws drop in awe is some drool dripping down the sides of his mouth.   Master and Commander:  this is supposed to be a  guy only  movie. Is it unnatural that I enjoyed it? And it wasn't because Paul Bettany is so darn goodlooking either (I tend to watch him on the screen with the patented Nicholas Cage look, plus drool). It was a fun movie and had really nice music. I'm not sure where it came from, but throughout the film, I felt like continuously kicking Billy Boyd in the face. Not that he did a bad job, but I just felt that urge. Beats me.   Tomb Raider 2:  and I thought you couldn't sink lower than TR 1! I didn't even finish this piece of crap, I went to the cpu to play The Sims halfway in the movie, and my roommate fell asleep after 34 minutes. At least the story is easier to get, but man, is it dull. I can't remember seeing anything blow up either. I mean really blow up, with fire and a miniature mushroom cloud. I usually don't really like action movies, but I was longing to see something blow up in this one. Although I must say that watching a piece of Santorini crumble was quite relieving. (whatever happened to the partiers? Did they all die? Did that fancy turntable survive? Where exactly is Santorini? I know it's in Greece, but where in Greece? Why was Lara Croft so happy about this terrible disaster? Is she really that shallow, that she can only focus on the money, and completely ignore this awful tragedy? Whatever happened to the old guy? These are just a few of the questions that arose in my mind while watching the first 15 minutes of the movie.)   Monster:  a bit nice, but pathetic. What a pathetic person. Good acting, not so sure about Christina Ricci. I still doubt whether her acting is a style I need to get used to, or, if in fact, she just sucks. Not the best movie about pathetic people I've seen (The Hours, different pathetic, but still a bit pathetic. Definitely better), but it had the most mesmerizing first kiss scene I've ever seen in a flick! Powerful enough to make me slightly (really slightly, dammit. I'm too cool for that) shiver.  And why does everyone smoke in every single movie?
