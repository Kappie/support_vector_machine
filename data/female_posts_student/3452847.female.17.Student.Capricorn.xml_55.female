I love that line, don't know where i picked it up from, anyway just had a lovely conversation with Jason, about lots of stuff etc, and i had to ask about Laura... He took her out last night for dinner and shes going with him today to the rehersal... I hate hearing about it, so i shouldn't ask... Hurts to hear him, i still don't believe that he feels strongly enough for her as he still cheated with me... I can gain a lil bit of feeling back from knowing that and knowing she is oblivious to it...  ~Lisa~
