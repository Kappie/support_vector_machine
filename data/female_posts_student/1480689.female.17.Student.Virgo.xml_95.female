But, hey it beats potentially throwing up in first hour right?  so i went tanning at like 4 and went over to mike's, heard a leak from my car, didn't know what from, walked up to it, most definately my tire, booked ass home, hoping my tire wouldn't explode. dear lord. but my dad fixed it, it was only the valve.  WHAT THE FUCK lost 4 people outta the homecoming group. whatever. fuck you zac fuck you amber fuck you jessica fuck you neuman. ahhhh this is aggravating. not angered, just frustrated.
