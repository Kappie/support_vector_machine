I dunno... 70's, says in an episode "Peel me like a grape so I can get out of here." Now, I don't know about you, but I mean, peeling a grape is hard. It's like, you gotta get the little thin outer layer and then you gotta like gently like pull it down and I mean the damn thing is so stubborn, like it knows its being peeled and it just goes "NO!" and then the outer layer breaks and you gotta destroy the thing just to get the whole peeling process going again. So yeah, tody was good. It was SO nice out it was like 80's and like really breezy and just so nice. It was great to run in just a sports bra again instead of the like 10 layers of shirts, 2 layers of pants (not including tights) and 3 pairs of socks. Just to be freEeEeEeEeEe. Yeah, then I came home and did my chores that I told myself I had to do. Like unpack from my dads, do laundry, and just get everything away for when my mom gets home. She's been in Florida and chances are shes relaxed from the trip and in a good mood and we want her to stay that way cause I still haven't told her about prom or post-prom or anything. By the way, Mick and I are back together. We talked things out, like we always do which is awesome, and now we are peachy. I like that word... "peachy"... sounds nice. I had a funny moment in the locker room today. We were all comparing our sunburns and Laura told me I looked pink and I said "I prefer Salmon, thanks." with like mock annoyance in my voice. We thought it was funny and SCREW YOU IF YOU DONT! Track News: I got thrown off the 4x4 for Penn, I'm runnin the 4x1 now. I mean, I understand why she did it but.... still.. dun mean I'm not upset about it. So yeah... things are good. I love this time of year. I've had my window open since like 4:30 and it's still really nice out and it's like 8:05. It's really nice cause the trees are startin to bloom so it's like yay! SPRING! and then, after that.... SUMMER!!! x0x
