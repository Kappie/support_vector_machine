I feel sick and worn out now. I don't feel like doing much except maybe taking a shower and watching a little Rocky or Cadfael. Yeah I love that monk.   I'm glad to be back. Very glad. It was a hard trip, really. Mostly I had a really rotten time but some things were okay so it balances out to being 'alright.'     Music: Ted, Just Admit It... - Jane's Addiction
