(actually i dun have the rite to say anything lahz. but this is my blog. hehe. so ppl here's my say...)   to bh: i forgive u for wat u have done, even though i feel very sad. maybe i juz want to prove tt i wun bear grudges n i can forgive n forget. (haha.. sound a little bit sarcastic. :P) coz at tt pt of time i really feel very wei qu. juz think. u were walking on the street one fine day. n suddenly someone came up to u n gave u a slap in the face. u don't noe the reason y n tt person juz apologized n walked away. how will u feel? same analogy rite. but thanks to all my nice nice gfs in the class who always try to cheer me up when i m sad... hehe... n i feel tt yq shouldn't apologize for him. it's not her fault even though they r close friends. thanks 6677. thanks ms. thanks yt. thanks dory. thanks qt. thanks gim. thanks mad. thanks everyone...
