When I got back to my flat, I found the old roommate was gone and a new roommate coming tomorrow.  Maintenance was here cleaning up for her arrival.  I shifted my stuff in the kitchen so that I get my allowable cupboard space.  It's only fair.  Fridge too.  I'm tired of being the lowest guy on the totem pole.  Going to  urlLink Milestone's  for spinach and artichoke dip tonight.  So good; haven't indulged in it since early 2002.  N. is coming in from her small out-of-the-way town to Hogtown for a visit.    This is going to be a strangely busy week.  J. from Calgary is visiting tomorrow so we're having breakfast.  I'm invigilating an exam all afternoon, then have Rosary group at 7 (if I have enough time and I'm not half-past dead).  Tuesday is worse -- from 9am until a time undetermined I'm doing a joint grading session with the three other TAs and the instructor.  This could be painful; I think having them all there talking will be distracting when I just want to grade and go.  Have to track down my sponsor this week and find out when I'm working next week as well.  Wednesday, I meet Marilyn for a last minute, reassuring meeting (I hope!) and then it's back to Steeltown for my dad's surgery.  No rest for the wicked.  Time to figure out what to wear and when I have to leave to get to Union Station.  More to come...
