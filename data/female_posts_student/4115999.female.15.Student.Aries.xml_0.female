I'm going to miss being at my dads so much, I have had so much fun these past two months. It was so great not having to deal with John. I'm going to miss all the new people I met while here, its kinda sad. I don't think I'll miss Austin that much just because I won't. But I'll miss seeing people like Lisa, Antonia, Denim and Drew. They've been cool to hang   out with even if it wasn't that much. But I guess I am looking forward to seeing some people, like Kim Cortney Jessica Mindy Katielynn Sarah and some other people too. This was a really big summer for me, I don't think I'm as shy as I used to be at the end of school. It's going to be  so great when mom and I move at the beginning of October. La la la. I have this freakishly huge bruise on my right thigh from trying to skateboard. I don't think I'm ever going to get good at that, I fall t oo much. Woot, I am somewhat tan!!! But not that much. Hmm, I want some hot coco, but its to warm to have that. Last night was fun, I went to Lisa's at like a 'lil bit after 6pm an   d we played Mario cart for like an hour or something till her parents got home. Then we went outside, and I attempted to ollie multiple times and came very close to doing it, but sadly I didn't. Then, Drew and Brandon came walking down the street and sat by use in Lisa's front yard, it was odd we just kinda threw grass back and forth and thanks to Lisa I had the whole front yard down my shirt. After a lil bit we ended up playing kick ball with Lisa's two little brothers Kevin an  d Ryan, and Kevins two friends Doug and...umm....I don't remember the other ones name....He kinda freaks me out anyway. Dougs pretty cute he's 14 I think and turning 15 in like two months or something that. But anyway, the teams were Lisa, me, Dr ew and Brandon. Then the other peoples were together. We won!!! Woot woot!!! Happy dance!!!......I love the happy dance its so goo d! Lol. If you people haven't checked out www.homestarrunner.com you need too and watch teen girl squad, its so good! I think I pulled a muscle in my bum. It hurt. Well I'm going go so I'll talk to you people later!
