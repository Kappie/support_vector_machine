Okay, so maybe I psychoanalyse *no, no, i'm not clever. i'm sure it's spelt wrong* people too much (or maybe it's because I'm listening to Goo Goo Dolls) Hmm. Why do people ignore you? Why do you ignore them? Maybe you're ignoring the fact that you don't or do like them or some thing. (I'm sure there's too many inuendo's to list in that!) Why do some people go out of their way to make your world worse, why do they go out of their way to make it better? But then, if you analyse things too much then you don't live, you watch. It's hard.
