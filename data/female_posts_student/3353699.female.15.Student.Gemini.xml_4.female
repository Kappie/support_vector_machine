My real hair color (yes it's mixed in there somewhere) is dirty blonde. but so far ive put red streaks,-Fire engine red and black streaks, maroonish streaks, and dark red steaks- in it. (at diffenet times of course) the red has faded every time. (i know why don't worry) so as of now my hair is dirty blonde with blach streaks and the bottom layer is black too. and mixed in there is some strawberry blonde from the faded red. so yeah it's pretty funky. i have green eyes. yeah i guess that's all im gonna say to descibe myslef.  on to other news (if you can call it news)  yesterday my sister had some friends over for a little b-day thing. one of them brought scary movie 3. yes the movie is pretty funny, but most of it has to do with the movie, The Ring... yeah i didn't like that movie too much.in other words.. it scared the crap outta me. yeah so now im home alone and im picturing that darn girl that comes outta the screen everywhere in my house. it's not fun lemme tell ya.  as for today. (other than picturing a killer girl thingie) I've been watching CMT pretty much the whole day. yep isn't my life just so lively? hehe well ok i guess that's it. I promise my blogs won't be so long next time. even if you want them to be long cu i just don't know what to say most of the time. -andrea "Hey You" (as called by my english teacher) H
