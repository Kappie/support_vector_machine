At 15 the Spice Girls burst onto the scene with one of the ultimate girl anthems. I have always been a romantic. I believe in the power of fairytales, but something was always left out - that women have rights and deserve not only to be loved but to be respected. Finally it was ok to refuse to accept the patriarchy of society. Women everywhere started wearing platform shoes (although not me, I am tall enough) and saying what they thought. The Spice Phenomenon swept the world in a way not unlike Brit boybands, they are still one of the highest selling girl groups of all time and created a music genre all of their own.  Posh Spice was not the most loved member of the band. She didn't sing solo on their first single and received the tag of "untalented". Despite brilliant performances in many of their hit singles this tag remains today. Yet many years after the band split, she is the most photographed woman of our time. Why? The reason is quite simply the man she married - David Beckham!  The man of the hour, Goldenballs is adored like no other footballer has ever been. The reality is that we globally know who he is because he married a Spice Girl, but we remember him because he is the greatest footballer of four time.
