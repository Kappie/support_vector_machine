Anyways, this is only a short post, because I just wanted to post this cool poem I found. 'Tis quite amusing.    As I strolled down along the quay  All in the lateness of the day,  I heard a lovely maiden say:  "Alack, for I can get no play."  A minstrel boy heard what she said  And straight he rushed to her aid,  But too much drink the task forbade,  And so the maid he could not lay.  Alack for I can get no play,  Oh woe is me and lackaday,  O chaste and pure I'll always stay,  Alack for I can get no play.  To mirror went she straightaway  And did her ruby hair array  And for her gown she much did pay  Though on her bod it should not stay.  Then down she walked along the street,  A handsome lad she chanced to meet,  And sore by dawn were her dainty feet,  But all the boys were gay.  Then cried she at the break of day  And hung her head in such dismay  To mourn the dearth of fine boo-tay  "Alack, for I can get no play."  Alack for I can get no play,  Oh woe is me and lackaday,  O chaste and pure I'll always stay,  Alack for I can get no play."    lol, I can't remember who it's by, sorry, so my compliments go to the author. (It's from a fic) I just thought it was amusing...alack! (And for all those smart asses who are laughing at me, because I have such a stupid poem in my blog, the jokes on you! Haha! I'm so hot, as if that poem would apply to me. 8-)  Anyway, life, as usual, is dull, thanks for asking. I am never ever having children. Ever. Work experience was fun, but thoroughly disturbing. Ick...We have a debate next week. Haha, I'm chairperson. muhaha! I doubt we'll win, but. Oh well. Must dash. Writing this has been absolutly spiffing. Taa raa!   There's a moon in my hat!
