Is this the world that we live in?  Is this the hell that we call society?  What is so "civilized" about our world?  The Earth seems like a painting, something the artist wants you to see.  From far away, the Earth seems so pristine and clean.  Closer, you notice the kind people.  Closer than that, you see the dark pit in their hearts.  Who cries now for the lost girl?  Who cries?  I see people walking by, looking at their own shoes.  They're reading the newspaper with the picture of her pure face plastered on it.  What do they care?  It's not their problem.  What can they do?  Nothing.  It's all just some more juicy gossip that will last them for a week.  Ask them what they feel for the parents.  "Terrible," they respond monotously with their dry eyes.  "Too bad," they think.  "This happens everyday around the world, it's best not to dwell on it," someone once said to me.  Basically, the world has run out of hope and it's best not to think about the bad things that always happen.  Wonderful, our world that is.  Bad things happen all the time so everyone's heart is already as hard as diamonds.  So pretty to look at, so nice to have.  It's only for show.  Science is demanding for more progress!  Faster!  Faster!  What for?  What's the reason?  Have we not lost ourselves enough with our theories and inventions?  I want to scream.  Stop!  Make the world stop!  STOP!  Can you not at least pause to think about the young and innocent we've lost?  Can you not spare a minute to shed a tear or two or is it too much trouble?  Whoever's reading now, cry!  Cry for the girl who never got to know what it was like to become a woman.  Cry for the girl who never got to experience marriage or have her own children!  Cry now for the parents who have lost their one treasure!  And what for? Because of the many disgusting foul creatures that dare call themselves human, that dare call themselves living!  I beg you all now.  Please, tonight, spare at least ten minutes to think of this poor girl and her family.  Do not only think of this girl but think of all the others too like Holly Jones and many more.  Please, cry for them.  The next time you complain about life, think of them and try to enjoy both the sad and happy parts of life for their sake.  We are all fervently hoping for the safety of all the brilliant young girls out there to watch out for themselves.
