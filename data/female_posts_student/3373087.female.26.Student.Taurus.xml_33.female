I had a sneaking suspicion that he and Karyn are more than friends by now.  Last time we talked he told me that she was being "friendlier" than usually lately.  She even came ove to his house before the wedding and HE HELPED HER DO HER HAIR.  That seems like something a boyfriend would do, not that I've ever asked B for help with my hair. When I called him he had some high schoolers in the car with him and he sounded tired.    The more I think about it, the more I can't wait until I live by myself.  At first, I felt guilty for wanting to live alone.  Somehow, it seemed selfish and anti-social. Afterall, it was definately unheard of in Berkland that someone would live by themselves.  I guess the concensus was that roommates helps you to know yourself better and teaches you how to love others.  I think this is absolutely true, but does this mean that living by yourself is then selfish? I guess it depends on WHY I want to live by myself. Of course the main reasons are about difficulties with Julie.  Sometimes I wonder if I would have more or less trouble with her if I actually confronted her about the things that bother me--like cleaning up and her sensitivity to noise. Believe me, for the vast majority of the time, communication about what bothers me is the better than stewing in my frustration. This is definately what I believe in the context of my relationship with B, for instance. In Julie's case, I was worried that confronting her would cause her to have hard feelings against me. This has happened when Jenni confronts her about stuff, and now the two of them have a very awkward relationship. I'm also not a very confrontation person at all, so it's hard for me to bring up stuff with people I don't know that well.  It's funny--I've lived with Julie for nearly a year, but I don't feel like I know her an ounce better than day 1. Well, Julie's only going to be living here for another 2 weeks, so I won't have to deal with whether or not to confront her anymore.    The core of the issue is: Do I want to live by myself so I can do what I want without dealing with roomates?  By "deal", I mean "communicate, compromise, and sacrifice." Would only a truely loving person want to work with difficult roommates until a resolution is reached? If this is true, does this mean I'm not loving because I don't really want to work things out with Julie?    It seems like B is getting more and more anxious about seeing me the longer we're apart.  This is proof of how attached to me he is, but I'm also worried that this is distracting him from his studies.  Diligence with regards to school/work is acutally a turn-on.  I guess I like geeky guys (which explains my crush on Toby McGuire and Harry Potter).  Diligence is a sign of self-discipline (delayed gratification), and self-discipline is a sign of maturity. I'm not saying that I think that B is immature.  I also think that focusing more on school and Bible study would make the time go by more easily. How much he misses me is flattering, but it's also good to have a firm grip on one's emotions--control THEM, instead of having emotions control YOU.   More shopping today in Napa Valley.  Wouldn't that be a beautiful place for a wedding? I feel like I'm being drawn in more and more into materialism.  My wardrobe isn't that big for a girl, but that's rapidly changing. I've gotten 8 new tops over a week's time. Isn't that a lot? What's scary, is that window shopping at the mall after eating at Todai's still made me look longingly at some cute skirts I saw in the windows. Also, the thought of moving in to a new place makes me think about going to Ikea and getting a futon for the living room (if Jenni decides to keep hers), lamps, dishware (I'm using Jenni's now), and countless other essential and non-essential household stuff.  I worry about money more than I should sometimes, yet I have no problem laying down big bucks at Bennetton for 4 cute tops that I "must have". Now that I'm dating B, my clothes are getting smaller and tighter--and it's not because I've been gaining weight.  For instance, I tried on the red top I bought last week that is shoulderless on one side and she was like, "just don't wear it to church".  And I bought my first tube top today!  I really like it, but this is the first time I even considered wearing something like that. I think it looks classy and dressy, but still--I'm not used to showing that much skin. I also have this urge to buy cute lingerie.  Not the uncomfortable kind, but the kind that's sexy but something I can also sleep in (assuming that I will acutally be sleeping with clothes on in Boston). That's something B will appreciate though...
