I even turn down the air to like 71-72 but I still feel like I'm on fire.  Ugh.  It's the same way at work, too.  The girls will all be freezing their asses off but I'm comfortable, then when they turn up the air so that they are comfortable, I'm burning up.  It's madness, I tell you.  And that paper that I finished writing yesterday...  That has got to be the shittiest paper ever.  I waited until this morning before I printed it out so that I could proofread it one last time and I know that it's a shitty paper but there isn't anything else that I can come up with to change that fact.  I've got to get ready to leave.
