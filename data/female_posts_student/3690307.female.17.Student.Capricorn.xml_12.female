It was in the style of a movie, very cinematic. Anyway, this is how it started out...    A woman with blond hair walks down a long, long corridor. She is wearing a flowing white dress, with both shoulders exposed. The sleeves pour out unattached down her arms until the wrist, where a slender circle of fabric grips each wrist loosely. She is wearing white high heels, and as they make their presence known, they betray the owner's nervous apprehension.    *Clack Clack Clack*. She is walking at a fast pace, as if she's worried about something. Maybe it's just my mind jumping ahead of me, but I can already see a hint of fear on her features.    *Clack Clack Clack*. You can tell she is underground. No real signs of this, other than the lack of windows or fresh air in the corridor. As for the corridor itself, the walls are made of series upon series of paneled lights, that emit a soft, gentle light into the hallway. The corridor curves slightly, as if part of a giant wheel. She keeps walking.     A quiet noise joins the clacking of her heels. It is a *click, click, click* from behind her. It doesn't seem to concern her,          yet.    The clicking has grown louder, and she has become more sure that the noise is coming from behind her. Her breath quickens as she chances a look. Still walking, she can't see anything behind her. She straightens her head and keeps walking, but faster.    She looks back again. With a sobbed breath, she realizes what the clicking noises are. With a steadily increasing pace, the paneled lights on either side of the hallway are turning off in sequence. They click as each one is extinguished. The woman, grasping an instinctual truth of the situation, begins to run, doggedly in her high heels. *ClackClickClickClackClickClickClackClack*. She cannot outrun the dying of the lights behind her. The last you can see of her face before the darkness engulfs her is panicked and terror stricken. And then, it is dark.    Time passes, and, as with most dreams, the dreamer known that something terrible has happened as well. I seem to know that she has been raped, beaten, or worse. But all I can see is the darkness, and as I approach her, I can barely make out her white dress. It is in tatters, and dark, heavy stains on the fabric glisten ominously. She is on the floor, panting. Her throat, hoarse from screaming into the darkness, seems to have closed up, and she wheezes. Suddenly, she senses me in the black fog, and snarls animalisticly. Her face is so close to mine. She has yellow eyes. And then it is over.        Brr, eh? That's about it, and I won't mention the parts about stupid Nicholus Cage in his Mercedes Benz, trying to convince Lauren and I into the car. Yuck, anyway, if you have a theory, or comment about the dream, totally share, because I have no clue want it could mean, or even if it's important.
