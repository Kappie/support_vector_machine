Until then, let me just use this phase for shortcut :). People intends to call me shorty. I'm 4'11", which isnt a perfect height for shit!!! I hate my height but hey I cant get away from this. I drank so much milk hoping to grow a few inches but that didnt work :(. Both of my parents are short people, so that makes me short as well. I dont have a point to this but can anyone answer my question?
