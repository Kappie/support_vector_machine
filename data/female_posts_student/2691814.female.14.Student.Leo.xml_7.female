People actually dance lol. Anyway, Tia's last day is tomarrow cuz she's goin back to Maryland :(..lucky her...she gets to go back to were she lived. So, Tia is going to the dance and invited me cuz Krystals on the committee. Deidra got an "ok" from her mom but she'll probably have to ask again cuz her mom was half asleep when she asked. I hope she cheers up cuz she's been pretty down about her party lately. But I just talked to her on the phone and she sounded alil more excited about it i guess. I just hope gabby goes cuz if she doesn't then cindy can't..or wont~ so im not sure cuz i have to pick them up. Thank god that fence is broken again so they can walk over and we can give them a ride.      I had soo much history homework but luckily it was only on Texas becoming a state so it was easy. I had about 31 questions and i had to write alla the answeres in complete sentences. plus i have a science test tomarrow but...i think i'll do okay.
