People are so crazily awesome! I can't wait until summer! I am going to have so much fun! I have to go to play practice today, in like 25 minutes, I think I'm going to go in PJ's all I care about is comfort! Poor __... it's halfway her own fault when anything gets semi serious she pushes him away. But goodness, sleeping with one person and making out with three people. I look like such a bum right now. Play practice is so time consuming! Tomorrow before school and after school and wednesday before and after school I have to go in for math and PE. Which also means Thurdsay before school. Well play practice awaits. Ciao
