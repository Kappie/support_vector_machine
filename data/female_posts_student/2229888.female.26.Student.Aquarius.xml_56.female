(not a fun experience to have with a baby, btw)  ant is totally into paintball alluvasudden... not that he hasn't liked it for a while, but Nathaniel came in last night wearing 30 lbs of paintball gear (including night vision) and now ant is shivering in antici....  pation... now i am going to be a fake military wife... yipes...  i hate when ant gets into these thiings... he is totally engrossed and cares even less about his family than usual, since we are no longer convenient... geez... i better get ready for the long haul, so to speak.  UPDATE: didn't get to take the baby in today... i rescheduled and gramby is going to give us a ride wed...
