Hopefully on Wed. a bunch of us can get together and do something. I got home yesterday, and i didn't eat dinner, and I didn't even watch TV. I dont' need TV anymore. It felt weird listening to the radio too. I feel like i've lost my family. Well, I finished my mission trip journal part. I've gotta' go get my pictures developed later today. Hopefully they'll be good. Steven said his were. -lol- I can't wait to see them. If anyone from Sons ray's reads this, PLZ come to thursday night this week k? b/c we're all bringing our pictures, and I want to tell ya'll what happened. Well it's shower time people. Later-  Liz
