AND i couldnt even finish off the day by sitting next to chadd and delighting in his antics. but, i did get home at 3 o'clock, that was a bonus.  im scared- brendan told me tonight that he had something very important and he asked meif i liked chadd (DAH!) and then said "you know i would tell you anything, right". i am petrified what hes going to tell me and im scared its something bad. i shall report later  luv me
