Harry/Hermione: JK Rowling always seems so surprised when she finds out people ship these two. That, and the fact that they seem to be such platonic friends, causes me to doubt this ship would ever happen. I'm not saying it would be really boring or anything, but they just don't radiate that type of chemistry (in my mind). I've never seen romantic sparks from either of them together. I do think it's an awesome relationship the way it is and an awesome friendship. I love it when they collaborate solving Harry's insane problems. Romantically: Nope.  Ron/Hermione: Yes, I'm a R/Hr shipper, though not an insane one. I definitely see chemistry between these two - Ron was SO OBVIOUSLY jealous of Hermione and Viktor Krum, and I think it was incredibly obvious to Hermione, too. Maybe (and I have to reread the books majorly) at first, she was okay with spiting Ron with Viktor, but I think now she's beginning to have second thoughts about it. And think of all the times she and Ron have had to work together to keep Harry on track. Think of all the times they've probably shared with each other when Harry wasn't around. Some might say that they fight so often that there's no romantic spark there - but I think the fights are part of the relationship... fights keep things healthy! They seem to complete each other, and I can see this ship lasting a long time.  Draco/Hermione: A long time ago, perhaps first book, I could've seen this ship happening. But I think in light of Malfoy turning more and more evil (like his father) as the books progress.... there's not a chance Hermione would risk her friends' trust for a relationship with him. I would be incredibly disappointed if any of the characters we've grown to love turn to Draco. Sure, it would be fascinating to watch Hermione's inner conflict - but the book is about Harry, remember, and we wouldn't get to see much of what makes this ship so fascinating. And JK would never make it canon, ever. She just doesn't seem to think that way.  Harry/Ginny: I'm not sure what to make of this one. I don't know what Ron's reaction would be to Harry dating his little sister, but it would likely be more positive than his reactions to Michael Corner and Dean Thomas... This is one ship I probably would find boring, though. It's just... blah. So what. There's nothing there but platonic and even distant friendship.  Draco/Ginny: Oooh, now this would be interesting. Except for the fact that, um, GINNY WAS CAPTURED AND NEARLY KILLED BY VOLDEMORT, who happens to be a very close friend of the Malfoys. If Draco was merely a slightly grey badass boy, I could see it - but he gets blacker and blacker every book, and I'm willing to bet that Ginny loathes him. Sometimes loathing/hate is closely related to love, but any love here would be from Draco's end, and he hates the Weasleys. Although he could see her as the exception to the rule because of her looks or something. It could possibly be a Draco-chases-girl type thing, and lead to a one-time thing between the two.  Ginny/Neville: I'm not sure when this girl will settle down for a long-term relationship, if ever! So for the moment I actually ship Ginny/Random Dude. A spot which could easily be filled by Neville Longbottom. Surprising but true... they've got history, it could be cute and oddly fulfilling for both of them.  Harry/Luna: This is MY ship. This is the one I'm rather passionate about at the moment. These two have so much potential and so much in common. Both are slight outcasts, both have lost parents and can see thestrals, both aren't afraid to defy the conformity and step outside the box. They seem to complement each other. Harry doesn't mind her talking about Sirius, something kind of rare - and at the end of the fifth book, a bond seems to have been created. I can see Harry becoming fascinated with her, maybe attracted to the more hidden qualities of her personality that others fail to see, because they choose not to look deeply enough at her. He might like her sense of humor and grow to see her as more of a person than anyone else ever has. Luna, I think, already understands Harry. Under her dreamy exterior, I can see a quick thinker and perceiver, and I think she already knows him from the inside out. And she accepts him as he is. He needs somebody like that in his life. *so speaketh the Harry/Luna shipper*  Snape/Lily: In other words, a ship of Harry's mother and Snape at school. I'm certain Lily felt nothing but pity for Snape, so I don't think this ship works. I don't think any Snape ship works, because the girls he likely loved felt nothing but loathing or pity for him, and the girls who loved him (if any), he shunned away because he's used to a loveless existance. Snape has a hard, cold shell, and it would take a miracle for anyone to break it.   James/Lily: I want to know how Lily went from hate of James to marriage. I also want to know what deflated James's head in the first place - seemed like a heartless git in the fifth book. This ship is definitely one JK must explore in the future, because it seems incredibly crucial and important to me. I would be interested to see, but I'm not a fanatical shipper of these two.  Remus/Lily: This ship would be sweet. I'd very much like it if Lupin and Lily had a short, sweet relationship for awhile. I think they'd have an interesting history and chemistry, and I can definitely see either of them crushing on the other, if only briefly. I'm sure there's something there that could be explored.  Sirius/Lily: This ship would certainly be interesting... sparks would fly for sure. This is somewhat of what Draco/Hermione or Draco/Ginny could be if Draco wasn't such a bastard. These two POSSIBLY had something at one time. Sirius was probably attracted to her and chased her a bit - she never let her guard down, though. This ship could be fun.  That's all I can think of for the moment - hope you found it interesting.
