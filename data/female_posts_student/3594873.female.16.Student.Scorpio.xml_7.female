Mariam: The ear stood under the black hair, slightly to the right of the monstrous nose, southwest of the beady eye, waiting for these herds that came to hear. It was an ear marked with superiority; canals that run through, and a tiny hole in the center of its lobe which was the hook of the earring.  Amina: Nah, the hippopotamuses did not go that superior ear, but rather to the ear on the opposite side. The left ear.   Mariam: Oops my daisies. I had quite forgotten that the hippopotamuses were exiled and disowned by the superior ear. You know, the scandal is hardly talked of. Even less the bumble bee that was a honeyetarian. Scandalous, I do say.    Amina: Oh no, my little chap. The bee was not a honeytarian. I think you meant that it was anti-honey. That little trumble bee refused to eat any of the glorious honey. I remember it clearly. They said, the bee said, “ I ai’nt sweet and I don’t want to eat something sweet.” Still that was nothing compared to the dandelion petals. Remember them? They refused to fly away. Said, “home sweet home, we’re never leaving you.” And they stayed. Dandelion petals aren’t supposed to do that: they’re supposed to be brave you know. Them being called dande-LIONS. They’re supposed to fly far away from home, but these… were….err….humph. It was just so scandalous I can’t talk about it.   Mariam: But don’t forget the story of little bear. Legend has it, that in ancient times a baby bear was born on the first night of spring. As he grew older and older, his mother began to teach him how to hunt salmon. But a curious and unusual thing happened, the little bear could never catch one. Almost as if the pond was deserted and contained nothing even if it was overfilling with salmon. Each day his mother would have hope and would send him off with some tips, but each day he would come home empty handed. His mother, desperate to help him, asked an old berumim- old, wise bear. She went to the ultimate bERuMim, known only as FATHER bear and asked him to help her son. FATHER Bear told her, he’d seen this little bear and the truth was this little bear had woven tiny leaves into a coat. so you can see this little bear, was not bare at all! And that’s why…because he did not follow the law of the jungle (as Rudyard kipling would say) he was cursed to live on an empty bare stomach. Shameful I say. I can’t really speak of it.   Amina: Oh, that was absolutely scandalous. Really, there are some things I know, I can’t speak about them either. Horrible, horrible. Let me tell you, the story of the butterfly. Oh, what? You know it already. Yes, yes, I understand. I won’t bother the time to say it. Let me just tell them a bit. The butterfly was once a fly who could not fly. He was a walk so to say (because he couldn’t fly.) One day, his mother, the poor old mamfly said, “Son, we have tried everything we can to make you fly. Let’s just put some butter on you, and maybe you’ll get slippery.” The little fly agreed and followed his mamfly’s order. But when he put the butter on himself, he found that all the petals of the wind stuck to him and so he became beautiful. The shameful thing, now extraordinary, left his mother and flew off. Never talked to her again when he became pretty. Really, it’s absolutely shocking I can’t talk about it.   Mariam: Oh no! That’s not the story at all. No way. Now you know, I don’t like to talk about these things, you know I don’t. You know, I never talk. I don’t. I’m closed book when it comes to these things: but really, just to educate you: the story is, his father being a cheap man (as you know all men are) used Tut Tue Tut butter. That awful kind! And so when he wore the butter all the village butterflys made fun of him. Well the truth it, it became so hard for him that he just killed himself. That’s the true story. I swear! But you know the juiciest, I mean most disgraceful story of all is Tweety’s…but well that I just can’t open my mouth about it in public.   *Meet you at my house for some tea.   Amina: Oh dear, your story is completely wrong. Let me tell you the right version.  The butterfly was once a fly who could not fly. He was a walk so to say (because he couldn’t fly.) One day, his mother, the poor old mamfly said, “Son, we have tried everything we can to make you fly. Let’s just put some butter on you, and maybe you’ll get slippery.” The little fly agreed and followed his mamfly’s order. But when he put the butter on himself, he found that all the petals of the wind stuck to him and so he became beautiful. The shameful thing, now extraordinary, left his mother and flew off. Never talked to her again when he became pretty. Really, it’s absolutely shocking I can’t talk about it. (now whose the idiot who actually re-read it? I said the correct story in the beginning, duh!)  Okay time to leave so that I can go visit mariam.   posted!
