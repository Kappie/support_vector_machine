Since I have some time b4 I'm to leave and pick up Lizzie to meet Jessica at school to see Harvey I decided it'd be a perfect time to do this.  I wish I could tell you all good news but I just can't.  This week has sucked!  The description Renae used was a "suicidal week" and it fit really well.  Even though we aren't so don't get worried people.  Monday sucked b/c I was sick, coming down with a cold.  Tuesday sucked b/c I had a doctors appointment and am now on meds but also have to go back in over Christmas break and get a blood test so they can check for diabetes.  Which in all honesty I am very afraid to see the results of considering I have a lot of the symptoms and it is very common in my family.  Wednesday sucked b/c...well I just don't want to get into it but I would like to say I went through all the emotions you go threw when someone dies even though no one died and also to thank Sean for ruining my day.  (jk Sean I love you anyway)  Thursday sucked b/c...it just did.  Today sucked b/c the rest of the days in the week sucked so it felt the need to follow along.  Today in study hall when Renae declared it was a suicidal week Mr. P was sitting there and he got so scared and concerned.  Nikki being the brain she is asked if Renae wanted to talk to someone on suicide task force and Renae responded with "I am suicide task force!"  AH good times.  Oh well next week is another week right?  I'm sure it will be much better.  But today Powers basically let us do whatever, I'm thinking b/c he knew we were in a bad mood.  We FINALLY got to eat lunch on those cool tables no one knows the purpose of.   And he didn't say a word when he saw us on the internet in Newspaper.  Also I would just like to add that Renae you can to see the paper cut on my nose!  You see for all the ppl that weren't there to hear my screams, Renae got wild with the paper today and was talking with her hands and whipped me in the face with the paper and I screamed and I'm almost positive everyone looked at me in the hall but it hurt really bad.  You have no idea what it's like to have a paper cut on your nose.    This update is too long to add an a person of the day so I'm just not going to today.    I believe I'm coming down with Senioritis.  This is bad b/c it isn't even second semester of my junior year yet.    I'm kinda tired...  If I put the 101 things that are on my mind right now or at any time this would be very, very long.  My head is spinning with things but I think I better quit typing for now.  If you want to talk to me you now how to get me.
