THEN right after that, this f250 extended cab pulls up behind me and meg says that the guy is coming over to my window. so me being freaked out, he asks if my car broke down. you have no idea how much i wanted to say." no mr., we just thought it would be nice to sit in my hotcar on the side of the road for an hourwhile its over 96 degrees outside.... THERES YOUR SIGN!" so i tell him my dads on his way and he leaves. then my dad takes me and meg to get a new battery and then my padres tell us we can go on with our plans just to be home by 10:30. so we go on, call holden and christine to tell them we're ok after all and me and meg decide to go to barnes and noble to get coffee. well we finally leave and go to taco bell where holden tells us that hes in the woodlands too at a park sk8ing. so christine meets us at taco bell and leads us to the park bc i would so get lost trying to find it. we got there and holden and nathan were waiting by his car. we didnt stay there long, but it was fun while we were there. then we left and went to meet jeremy at bear branch park, so we followed holden there. and right when we got there some psycho cop over reacted to jeremy and almost arrested but the cop new holdens dad so he let him go. so yea, that was pretty "exciting" me meg and christine sitting on the curb by the cars while the cop tells nathan to get in holdens car, and tells the other cop to check out jeremy and nathan. but anyways, then christine left because it was almost her curfew. so me meg holden nathan and jeremy went to burger king off of research forest and chilled there for a while. then i called my house to tell my padres that i was about to come home and they were gone and my bros were there. nathan thought i was at a bar so i gave the phone to holden so hed believe i wasnt, and holdens like "yea man, we're at a bar gettin drunk". then i called my dads cell and told him i was about to leave and he was like... be careful hunny lol. so we told everone "bye" and then headed to my car. holden asked me if i knew how to get to the freeway from where we were and i was like... uh i think so lol, so he told me and then megan ended up calling him asking him if we went the right way or not, even though i told her i knew where we were so yea. so normally it takes me 15 min just to get to the freeway from my house, and 20-25 min to get to the woodlands from my house. well not last night lol. me and meg were pretty hyper so the stereo was up and we were goin for a while and we ended up spending less than 5 min on the freeway, getting from the back of the woodlands to my house in only 15 min! so yea. definately a friday me and megan will NEVER forget lol.
