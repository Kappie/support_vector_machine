On a cold wet  afternoon  no room for love and emptiness  by a freeway  i confess i was lost in the pages  of a book  full of death  reading how we'll die alone  and if a god will lay to rest  anywhere we want to go  in your house  i long to be  room by room  patiently  i'll wait for you there  like a stone  i'll wait for you there  alone   and on my death bed  i will prey  to the gods and the angels  like a pagan  to anyone who will take me to heaven  to a place  i would recall  i was there so long ago  the sky was bruised  the world was black  and there you led me on   in your house  i long to be  room by room  patiently  i'll wait for you there  liek a stone  i'll wait for you there  alone   in all i read  till the day was gone  and i sat in regret  in all the things i've done  for all that i've blessed  and all that i've wronged  in dreams till my death  i will wonder on   in your house  i long to be  room by room  patiently  i'll wait for you there  like a stone  i'll wait for you there  alone  alone   Goddess Bless.
