I am glad that I had it with me. Then when I got home Joey wanted to go to the store and so I took Travis' keys and drove. YAY I got to drive. Ok so it was only down the road in an alley but I still got to drive. I was excited. There was a man standing there I almost wanted to ask who he was because there was something about him but I didnt. All I could think of was coming home and getting away from the driving before I was caught. Lol. The antsy feeling still hasnt stopped. I'm hoping it means that AC is closer to coming here. My e mail is sitting up waiting for something from him and I sit around watching it like a hawk. I feel so silly. AC is so worth it though. I look at the calander. 5 days left until the end of the month. I hope he makes it.  I get home and Tony is sleeping on the couch. He's not feeling well. The stress from the last few days has gotten to him alot. He feels guilty for not remembering Ricky but it is normal for all the abuse that he has gone through to forget his past. I do not want to talk to him about things because I do not want to give him false memories. I also found Matt doing dishes. What a nice treat. Not to have to do dishes for a change. I sure do miss a dish washer Lol. I did a load of laundry (whites) and need to get them sorted and folded and ready for people to put away. To have a washer and dryer for the kids to do their own clothes would be heaven Lol. M asked me last night if I wanted to live the American Dream. Yes I told her, I want to it's what I've dreamed of all my life. Well I should close this out, finish up a few things and then log off line.
