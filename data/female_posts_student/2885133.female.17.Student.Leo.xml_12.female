Before then, all I knew was they they met in college and their friends pushed them together and then they got married. At a tense meeting with my great-grandmother, I realized my relatives only found out they were getting married two days before meeting the official people for the marriage license. Great-grandma got miffed, planned a ceremony of sorts the day before my birthdate in three years and then life went on.     Among other things, I finally got to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban... Wow, what a wonderfully hilarious movie. The humor was nice. I laughed a lot. The laughter-filled time was enough to drown out the noises of a rude audience. Cellphones (of reluctant parents who brought their children to view for probably the third time) rang throughout the film while the people behind me made jokes the entire time. Geez, people were behaving like they were in front of their own televisions instead of in a public theatre. Oh well... I did get a good laugh. My only prickly point about the movie is how it didn't seem to flow well. The multiple shots of the Whopping Willow smacking a bird was humorous, but it did get kind of boring... or maybe the constant chatter and snorts from people behind me ruined that.
