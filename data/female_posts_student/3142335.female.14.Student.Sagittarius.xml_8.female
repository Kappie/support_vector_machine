I just didn't think about anything that had gone wrong and I had the most awesome night ever...ok,so I go to Brandon Day with Justin N. and had a blast! It was nothing but mud! I mean could it get any better? aha So we're walkin around barefoot in the mud and rode some rides and it was great! And then we saw Kelley, Natalie,Jacob, and Justin B. So we walked around with them the rest of the day and had so much fun...Well then I see my cousin so I went and hung out with him and his g/f and alot of his friends for the rest of the night (Austin, Andrew, Melissa, John, Shane, and I don't know the others) So I'm walkin around with Melissa for a little while b/c Tris.(cuz) was like a dog the whole night and went and got free cotton candy it was a funny have to be there moment and I saw this guy from like forever ago that I went to school with named Zach Polzin!! I was like whats your name? and He was like Zach and then I said OMG!!! And punched him on the arm and said I'm Ashley Nowell!!! He was like wow!! Really??? It was funny b/c at our old school Power APAC we saw each other everyday and he was short and stubby and I looked totally different and we called each other like every summer just to see what the other was doing and now he's tall and dark and looks pretty good...aha so then I just walked away with Melissa and we found Tristan and we went and rode the zipper..we were all 3 in there together gah it was hilarious we had so much fun so then we get back off the ride and I'm tlakin to Austin whose uncle or cousin one or the other is Luke Andres!! That's William's cousin!
