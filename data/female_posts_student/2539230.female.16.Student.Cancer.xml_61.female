Walking with You is not without hazards Tripping's this traveler's curse The price paid for falling is more than my stumble In a world that is watching and waiting for worst But I listened when you said to go And I set out in spite of my fears I brought truth mixed with my imperfections And the question of what to say when I got here And now that I'm here       Chorus: Should I tell them that You are The One who has made me And saved me to set up a home there inside Should I tell them that I am A perfect example of all You can do with a life What should I say to them, what if I'm failing them? What should I tell them tonight?  Don't get me wrong I'm thankful to be here With this song to sing and a spotlight on me But lately I'm wondering if You are mistaken If You're seeing all of me there is to see But on every face I detect These same questions I've posed to you Like do You speak through the imperfect Or are we too dirty for Your light to get through I want You're light to get through    (chorus) 'Cause they're thirsty but my cup is empty, Lord Come and meet me here in this place 'Cause I'm unashamed, but I'm unprepared And I'm just plain afraid    (chorus x2)
