Usually, I'd forget writing the whole thing again, but this is a rather important entry.     Tonight was a lot of fun. It's odd though. I can have so much fun with people and the whole time, in the back of my mind, the fact that one of the people I'm with wont be in our little group in about five days permeates my mind.     We had Tom's goodbye party at Chili's. There were twelve of us. Tom, Manmeet, (I didn't know him at all) Mary Clare, Stephen, Chen, Chang, Kelly, Amit, Roger, Jeremy, Kathryn and me. It was a big table. Heh. It was ironic too. While we were waiting to get our table, my brother came in with his friends. Out of all the times and all the places, I saw them. Interesting. Well, welcome home for the weekend Chip. Hah.     Dinner was a lot of fun. Just good conversation and good food. It was pretty funny at the end while we were trying to pay the bill and we couldn't figure it out. Heh. It took us a while, but that's ok. It was funny. Oh, another funny thing from dinner. Roger was ordering Cajun chicken...except he said the j and u like you would in Spanish, so it sounded like "cahoon." And then Stephen goes..."you mean...Cajun??" Haha. Funniest thing I've heard in a long time.     Then, because Jeremy gave Tom fireworks as a gift, we all went to Tom's house to see if we could shoot them off, but then we realized that even though Tom's house and land plot are huge, he has a ton of trees, and the treeless area is his neighbor's area. Boo.     So, of course, where do we go? MG. Where do we always go? Hah. Meadow Glens is becoming like a second home to me. Sad...really.     So, we sat around there for a while trying to figure out what to do and we notice this empty beer case sitting on the sidewalk and we're just like, "we'll just leave it alone. It's not ours." So, we did and of course, who comes to see us? Cops. An undercover cop came by and was like, "is that yours?" And of course we're all like, "No, no!" And so, we just told him we were talking and stuff and he said ok and let us hang out. Cool cop. And, as he was leaving, Jeremy goes, "Bye Mr. Pavlicek." I guess he knew him somehow. It was just funny. Mr. Pavlicek said bye to Jeremy too. Heh, of all the cops to come across us. Chris' dad. Funny, funny times.     And so, we were all getting eaten by bugs and we all were a little cold, so we made a fort with the minivans. We backed them all together and had the trunksup so it made a little tent. It was super cool. I'll have to put a picture in here when MC gets them developed. So, we just sat and chatted and told fun stories.     It's sad knowing tonight was the last time I'll see Tom. Although he did embarrass me at times (like the last time we were at Meadow Glens) I'm still going to miss him a ton and think how much he’d add if he were here. It's funny though, I won’t remember the big embarrassments or the arguments I’ve had in high school. What I'll remember is the summers spent with my friends sitting in the back of a few minivans in the Meadow Glens parking lot. I’ll remember the three hour time spans spent sitting around trying to figure out what we’re going to do while constantly veering off topic. I'll remember the little things. The things that make it impossible to forget my friends. Amazing how watching a terrible movie or stalking boys can get me through supposedly one of the toughest times in my life. It’s too bad it takes a friend moving away to make me realize how precious the time I spend with my friends is.   I hope Tom has a great time in    Texas   and I hope he doesn't forget us, because I know I won’t ever forget him.     "Truly great friends are hard to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget."
