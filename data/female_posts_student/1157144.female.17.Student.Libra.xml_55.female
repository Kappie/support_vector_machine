I'm pissed tho--- a woman accused all of us swimmers of 1) being naked in the girl's locker room 2) having sex there too 3) spreading HIV with razors while having sex 4) running up to six year old girls with our dongs gingling.   The woman said that her kid had to be taken to the hospital for trauma due to our free balling, sex, and disease spreading.   First off, doesn't that sound a tad over the top????  Second, how the hell would we be allowed to do that?  We won't swear in front of our coach, not because she is religious, but because we seriously fear the reprecussions of SWEARING.  Imagine fucking!  We'd be wishing we were dead in hell.  The woman's complaint was taken seriously by the Campbell city council (fuciking stupid ass liberals) and the whole accusation mess is going to court and our coach may be fired.  Damn that woman!  What really happened was that the coaches allowed the boys into the girls locker room so that the girls could shave our legs.  We only shave up to our knee, so we had jammers on.  NO PENISES EXPOSED.  This is a tradition in swimming... nothing new or unexpected there.  I wanna kick this woman in her boobs and tell to her get a life... swimming is an open sport... expect girls/guys shavint together.  But don't start going ballistic and lying about us spreading HIV!!!!
