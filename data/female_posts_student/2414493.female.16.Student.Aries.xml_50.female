My hair is like straw and arranged accordingly, I probably still have makeup on from last night. Well. I just don't know what to feel right now. It was all that I could ask for, and then it wasn't. I laughed in bed this morning: I listened to grandma and didn't go for a guy who wasn't more into me than I was into him, but I still feel like I missed out on something.  A lot of firsts last night--but I'm determined not to add a broken heart to that list. With luck, I'll always be resilient and strong.  Damn it. Today I actually want to talk to Harrison and Julia. Today I actually wish Charles was online so I could spill, hear "tu eres mi tesoro" and all the Ave Maria lyrics again. Today I wish there were more people to kiss, more laughter to be made, more closeness and...not firsts.  I laugh at myself now: how could I ever think it could be such a big deal? But this is one of the rare times when I am too willing to reach out of my shell for someone else.  Mock trial Big Bear retreat? lol. That, I swear, was a separate thought entirely.  Ave Maria, cuando seras mia?
