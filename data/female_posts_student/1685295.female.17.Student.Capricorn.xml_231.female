     
      It's Christmas Eve, and I'm shivering in my own little Ossining corner, sick with food (and this is just the beginning) and on to wish you all a very Merry Christmas . . .I'd wish you a Merry something else, but all the other holidays are kind of past, I think.  In a few moments I'll be sucked into the whirling vortex that is my family - not that it hasn't happened yet, as I got home yesterday a few moments before my mother dragged a tree up the stairs by herself and installed it in my apartment . . .I mean *our* apartment.  But that's beyond the point.  The point is, my dear friends and lovers, to wish you all the best holiday break every, and to talk to you as soon as I can come back.  Merry Christmas!
