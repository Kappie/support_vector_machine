Anna was trying to sell her spray tan, and Quiera was like "I'll buy it...in case you guys didn't notice, I'm black!" AHH Olivia N was laughing, which made me laugh. I joked with Dr. D, I hope we're becoming friends. I did well on my math test and that was quite exciting! But... I got a 69 on my chem test! AHH 69! No but with the curve I got an 84 woo hoo! But I think I'm going to do my best in chem this quarter, so I'm proud, considering how bad this quarter has been. People were kind of breaking down today, due to the major stress of this week. I felt really bad, and I didn't know what to say or do! Hey, anybody who's stressed right now, I am here for you! WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS HELL! Our Spanish project was today. We did alright. I noticed lots of things we messed up on, but hopefully they weren't all too noticable. One of our pictures was labled incorrectly, and one slide talked about the character Belisa in the story  Las Medias Rojas , but she was in  Dos Palabras , well you can't win them all! I had to make up my gym class. I went to tennis, and I was actually good! I mean it's really rare that Allison Ansari makes contact with any kind of ball (ps that was supposed to be a little dirty). I went to Old Navy to turn in my application, surprise, they're not hiring. GREAT! Where should I work this summer? Let me know your suggestions. Good Luck to the APUSH girls tomorrow-you will kick ass!
