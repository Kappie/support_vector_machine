Ha Ha Ha, Firstly, we went to Suntec and had lunch (had Korean food) at the food court before hunting down the whole of Suntec City. Then, we went to Esplanade and the library.... took photos with a disposable camera and saw three classmates, it is as though we are ''fated'' to meet... And we were like so shocked and aaahhhh..... Oh, we also went to Haggen Dazs to have ice- cream, I odered mango shorbet. Very sweet and nice... ^_^ Lastly, we went to Raffles City and again went around. We did went to MPH and read almost all the comic books and X- MEN.... X- Men's history is so complicated *start singing Avril's Complicated* And then we had 'dinner' at Soup Spoon. Very tasting and delicious.... like the ORANGE spoon A LOT! And I went home after going to the library to borrow TIMES, NG and science magazines for holiday assigment.... Hah! Am I studious or what! I WANT THE HARRY POTTER 5TH BOOK "ORDER OF THE PHONIEX'' can anybody help me order and buy for me? *joking*
