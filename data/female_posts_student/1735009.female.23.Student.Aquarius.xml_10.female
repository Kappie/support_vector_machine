I don't know if I really want it, but at the moment I just keep thinking that if I have the required qualifications, I'm going to apply.  Really, what are the odds that I'm going to be offered the job in the first place?    Has the job rejection caused me to become more cynical?  I don't think so.  It wasn't one of my top jobs.  I actually forgot that I applied for it, but any rejection can cause a little bit of pain.  Must move past that, put on a brave face, and keep applying.  So that's what I'm doing.  Every day I search for jobs, well every day except the weekends.  I try to remember to check the email address that is on my resume, but when you have about four different ones, you tend to forget.  But I try.  Also going to email former bosses today, to keep up with them, see what's new in Fredonialand.  I miss that place.  I wish I would have been as forceful in keeping in touch with some of my former professors as I have been with my former bosses.  I'm hoping someday to get back up there and reopen the lines of communication with some of them.  But the application has finally loaded, so I figure it's time to work on that while rocking out to the best of Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Got a little Phantom playing in the background.  Good music to apply to jobs with, I think.  :o)
