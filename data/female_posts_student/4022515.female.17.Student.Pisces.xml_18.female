I've known that for a while, but i just didnt want to accept it. So he decided, and I'll have to move on. I'm broken now, but in time I know I'll be ok. I just wish he cared at least a little. Just knowing that I'll be ok eventually makes me feel better. I'll still be here if he ever changes his mind tho. I went to st joes last night and he didnt even talk to me. I went to a party afterwards which was SOOOO fun! I haven't been that drunk since last summer. Thats the most good looking guys ive seen in one place at the same time ever. there was brice (not mitch), brandon, brad, ryan in the red shirt, and tu tu not spelled like the ballerina. Good times. I dont think ill drink for a while cuz of the hangover i had to go to work with.
