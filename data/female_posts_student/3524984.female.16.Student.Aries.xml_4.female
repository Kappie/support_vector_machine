Of course...I had to get all "body-consious" and not go...but whatever™...After that, Jess and Lucie went to get their hair done. fun fun. Meh...I didn't get mine done...I did it myself. :D During that time. Me and Nat walked the streets and just were plain bored. Thats us though. At around 3:00 PM we went and got Nat's hair done. Her hair was nice. Great actually. But, I just went home,and was like fuck all. Der...I'm always like that...   Grad Night  Ok, supper was horrible. But I didn't mind. I had a glass of juice and some bread sticks. Ok, yes..my eating problems must stop and I know it...>. Grad Party  I couldn't stay the night at Alex's. But who cares. Nat either. So there. I went to his house. He has a pool, a dog...had a campfire going. (which was awesome) Frank was there filming everyone as they came in. AWESOMENESS! I had a wonderful time then. Just to be with my class, was enough.   The Morning After  Well, I was the first to get to school I got like 1 hour of HIGH-speed internet. Which is always great for music transfers and IMing. Chatted with Karley..*I LOVE YA GAL* That day wasn't emotinal. But ok.   Last Day :'(  Ok. EMOTINAL! CRYING CITY!! I cant belive it I even cried. Especially when they did "Le Pont" Long story...It's a tearjerker. Awww. I'm crying. Just replaying it in my head. Had a hard time leaving school. Really hard. To imagine...next year, alone...in a new school...ENGLISH school. Eep. Scary. Dad is like "Ifya dont like the fucking school, change!" No, mom isn't home yet..*cries*   Well, lets get to my regular rants...>:]   Yeh, today went out...skateboarded..with some friends. most of the day. After went out and bought two new CD's "The Darkeness" and "The Rasmus" (Rasmus ROCKS!!) [did you notice. I got my keyboard to work again..:P] My caps was jammed. Darn it...Angry at chain e-mails again I guess..heh. I haven't talked to Tae for awhile. I dont know whats up with him anymore... oh well. Someone else joined Scrrap the other day...I have no clue who he is...he seems nice enough though... I added him to MSN messenger, hoping maybe we could chat. But I guess not..its been like acouple of days and he hasn't added me...Aww well..   Fathers Day   You see, long ago...my dad did something..he hit me...and his ring got caught in my skin. so I have this scar on my face...I nevre went back to see him...I dont know...I'm scared now...I fear him...Well, his new wife Linda wants me to go to see him this weekend...its like do you think I am fucked?! Anyway...I dont want to be a part of that family..even though what I have now is falling apart...I'm offically dying...and no-one in my class knowes yet...please help...   Offically Dying  Yes...Sad But True...I suffer from S.A.D  Oh joy! More Pills to pop...*rolls eyes* I have an eating disorder...Nat told her mom. her mom told my mom [when she was still around] I guess it scared her away...bah...fuck her.
