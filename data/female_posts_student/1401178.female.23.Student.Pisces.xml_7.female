And for you teens out there, our Harry ( urlLink Daniel Radcliffe ) has become quite a hunky guy alongside with his best mates, Hermione ( urlLink Emma Watson  - with not-so-bushy-now hair) and Ron ( urlLink Rupert Grint ). Enjoy the guys and drool!!  Having blowing out his nice-in-a-very-sadistic way aunt Marge out of the Dursley's house, Harry storms off to another year in Hogwarts. That means another adventure and probably another encounter with Lord Voldemort. But not this time. This time Harry only has to encounter a psycho killer who's a follower of Voldemort. Not only that, but also a horde of dementors (which is a thing who guards Azkaban) in pursuit of the psycho known as Sirius Black ( urlLink Gary Oldman ). Hogwarts also has a lot more surprises in this movie. The big and sensitive Hagrid becomes one of the professors and yep, you guessed it, another Defense Against The Dark Art (sp?)'s professor. So what else is new? The Famous Marauder's Map. What does it look like? Well..don'cha have to find it out yourself? ;)  This third installment of the Harry Potter series gives me (or us) a refreshed view of Harry Potter. Being directed by  urlLink Alfonso Cuaron  ( urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien ,  urlLink Great Expectations ), the world of Harry Potter turns unexpectedly dark and serious - unlike the previous movies. We can also see that the characters really do grow naturally physically and psychologically. The costumes and the settings also support the movie in a beautiful way. We can see the complete landscape of Hogwarts such as the path leading to Hagrid's hut.  On the other hand, although it doesn't take time as long as the previous two movies, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban doesn't satisfy enough. The Prisoner (of Azkaban) only visualizes the book, which is of course has more complete explanations. For you out there who doesn't read the book (which is a pity and also impossible because almost every person reads Harry Potter), I suggest..yeah..read the book. I'm also disappointed with the way the characters express their sadness. At one time when Harry was mourning the fact that Black is his godfather, I didn't catch if he was crying or not. He sounds like crying, but I didn't see any tear or anything similar to that.  Personal Pick: - Check out the Weasley's twins, Fred ( urlLink James Phelps ) and George Weasley ( urlLink Oliver Phelps )! They've grown their hair in that famous British style which I like so much. I even search the actors in the Net! - Funkier Albus Dumbledore ( urlLink Micheal Gambon ). With all due respect to the late Dumbledore, our new headmaster of Hogwarts plays his part really good. If I were to choose my high school's principal, I would choose him.  That's all from me. Since this is my first time ever writing a review, I really appreciate all the suggestions and all the critics. =) Until then.. Mischief managed! *poof*   Links    urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Official Site     urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - IMDb.com
