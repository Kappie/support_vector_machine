I've been working numerous amounts.  Today is Rachel's Birthday! Happy B-day Rae!  I don't have to work today.  And dammit...I'm kinda bored.  I don't really know how to make an update for over a month...too much to say.  But yeah...I'm back now.  Things are good.  Things are getting to how they should be.  I'm getting my act together for the first time in a long time.  Je suis contente.  I'll start posting more. I promise.  Nice to cross paths again crazies. More to come.
