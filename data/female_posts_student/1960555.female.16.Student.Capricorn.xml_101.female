Lyrics:  Look what weâ€™re doing to the atmosphere No wonder the kids drug themselves to get out of here Perpetual motion Is killing our emotion So the rich can make a dollar Make another dollar  [yay, tomorrow i'm off for yet another glorious family trip to saskatchewan/alberta.  please someone tell me how i am going to survive this.  how on earth am i supposed to put up with incessent bitching and complaining for 2 1/2 weeks?  they don't take directions or advise ever. my mother is the most anal person i've ever encountered.  her mind has fucking carpol tunnel syndrome.  i'm always told that "I am the parent and when you're 47 you can do what ever you want."  all i want to do is flip out and shout back "i'm not a retard... i'm more than aware that you're the parent and that when i'm 47 i can do what ever the hell i want.  i also know that you've finally gone insane in that you think you still have any idea what you're doing."  gawd i wish i were exagerating.  this woman does not know how to let go of a grudge, and you know when you're in a bad mood and you just want to stay in a bad mood?  she just wont let you be.  she makes it worse.  she over analyzes everything until you loose it and want to kill her, even when she wasn't the original problem.  she just doesn't get it when i ask her, ASK her, to leave me alone.  she pushes it to the point that i get angery then she blames all of our fights on me.  it's so frustrating, but do you think that she sticks around to listen to my opinion on our fights?  no.  she whines about her opinion and bolts before i can talk.  and should i ever feel like talking to her, she's 'not in the mood'.  it's not sex mum, it's just a conversation.  i swear, if she didn't have her nightly bitch routine she'd happily be in bed at 4:30pm.  but no, she must stay awake to break my soul a little more.  she honestly acts like everything closes down at 4:30.  at 20 after 4 the otherday i asked if we could stop somewhere and pick up somne blank cds, but no, it was to late.  we were driving past a future shop and everything.  and I was driving.  i honestly can't take it anymore.  i just... need to get away...  [sorry about the bitching and complaining.... i don't blame y'all if you stopped reading forever ago.
