I went to West Virginia with my mom, dad, two cousins, aunt, and uncle. It was ok. I think we would have been more fun if we had gone to North Carolina tho. The house was nice. I accidently ripped the rolly ottomon (or is it ottoman?). We went horseback riding up mountains. It was fun. A big downside is that the crimson monkey rode up on his cotton pony monday (our first full day) nite. AND!! We were walking down the road looking at stuff and we saw a hillbilly. He was missing teeth. And smelled bad. I guess this is mean. But who cares no one reads this ne way. At least thats true according to my guestbook. So i figure (bcuz of this) that either A) No 1 looks at my blog (2 every one who comes here is illiterate or (q you are all stupid people who do not read the top. Well poop on you shirt and call it ice cream! I think i would prefer A but 2's ok too. My throat hurts. I went to keystone today with camp. I wonder if thats why. But i only really went in the water a little bit. Yesterday we were sposed to go to Sandcastle but it was closed due to the weather. SO they rescheduled for the 19th. I thot this was ok becuz i was gonna b there but im taking the next week off. Actually i don't think this blog is gonna work when school starts. Because im going to spend all of my free time doing homework. wh-hoo. But in 9th grade they start our transcripts and i want really good grades. Well not weekends.  Will work on blog when get back on my week off. Just finnished this uber sad and uber good book The Time-Travelers Wife. I added it to my list of favorite books. I clicked on it but im the only one. Any one who reads this go find it and read it. Don't kno if its real appropriate for my age group tho. My back hurts from this chair. Bye. Poop-a-lump.
