I will tell you a little more about myself than the profile tells you.   Favorite actors (based on talent): Alan Rickman, Colin Farrell, Parminder Nagra, Charlize Theron, Christopher Walken, Kate Winslet, Jeremy Davies, Ian McKellen, Lucy Liu, Uma Thurman  Favorite actors (based on appearance): Johnny Depp, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Colin Farrell, Johathan Rhys-Meyers, Brad Pitt, Renée Zellweger, Lucy Liu, Uma Thurman  Favorite TV shows: The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Deadwood, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The L Word, Dead Like Me  Favorite color: blue, green, or purple  What Harry Potter House would I be in: Slytherin, definitely (you would be surprised how telling House Sorting can be)  What do I want to be when I grow up: I am actually thinking about foreign relations or international affairs or something  And we push onwards to dreaming...   "Imaginary" by Evanescence I linger in the doorway Of alarm clock screaming Monsters calling my name Let me stay Where the wind will whisper to me Where the raindrops As they’re falling tell a story  In my field of paper flowers And candy clouds of lullaby I lie inside myself for hours And watch my purple sky fly over me  Don’t say I’m out of touch With this rampant chaos- your reality I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge The nightmare I built my own world to escape  In my field of paper flowers And candy clouds of lullaby I lie inside myself for hours And watch my purple sky fly over me   Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming The goddess of imaginary light   And now that we actually have good poetry, time for me to paste some old ramblings I found in my computer Notebook diary:  I looked up at a star tonight,  And for a moment we were one. Now I conceive a child of the star, But it will be a pitch black, For how can anything born of such tears Have any hue but black? It was born out of the void, Into this world of nothingness. But it will overcome itself And show the world what it can do. But I realize that I am the child. Born of the void to the world of nothing. And I wonder: What will become of me When my mother, Me, myself, Dies? All that will be left is me The tiny little black void Born of a star and a tear And my mother, Me, myself, Who will have died.  Shall I live on in honor of her, my, memory? Who shall be my mother? What shall I do for my mother's, my, funeral? I shall make music and dance, for I will have died. But still, I am still alive. I will give birth to myself, so I will live on forever In all my creations, I will be present. No matter how hard they try, they will never rid themselves of the void I will have concocted. My void will fill the earth. They will speak of it for millenia. That void, my void, will bring about Everything.  I must go now, though. Dinner is ready. Until another day, friends. Namaste.
