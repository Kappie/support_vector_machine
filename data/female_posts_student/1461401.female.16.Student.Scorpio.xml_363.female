       
      I was walking through my living room, getting lilly ready for her swim lessons, when I began to feel faint. I could feel the demons hands reaching out from behind me, aiming to snare me by my stomach, returning from this mornings dreams. I clutched my latest book to my chest, but it was too light. I felt like I was going to float off the ground and end up falling again. I laid the book down and grabbed the kitchen counter, waiting for my head to catch up with the rest of my body, while I calmed my breath and my racing pulse. My little necklace jingling all the while. My stomach still aflutter. Today could have gone better.
