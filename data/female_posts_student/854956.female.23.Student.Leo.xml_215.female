Unless, of course, I decide to go back to school to study music some more.  ;)  As much as I complained about this semester... I'm going to miss so much about it!  Especially MWF Brunch with Sandy, Bridget, and Naomi!  And, next semester when Naomi and I hang out... she'll be a married woman!!!  =-O  OMG!  That's such a weird thought!  I'll also have something to post after work tonight.  There's some stuff going on at the site... long story short, I think Chris is going to be terminated... because he's been picking on kids.  I mean, he's been doing it all year long... but now that I'm manager there... I'm not going to let it happen anymore.  I must admit, I feel sorta bad.  People probably look at things and think that I'm the one getting people fired.  I may be a tattler in a way... but it's about VERY important alleged actions.  I mean, we can't have stuff like what Heather and Chris are doing go on at the site.  It's a little thing called negligence... and that can NOT happen in childcare or pretty much EVERYONE at the site goes down with it.  And I don't want that to happen.  Not to me, and not to the 2 other people pursuing teaching careers.
