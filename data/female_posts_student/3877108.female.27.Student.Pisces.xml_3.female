Universal precautions quiz wasn't so bad.  I missed a question that I should have known the answer to (about the prodromal stage of infection) - ended up with a 95.  Lots of classmates seemed to feel that they over-studied.  That's something I like so far about our grading/school setting.  They post exam grades in our computer system (accessible from the web) on the same day they're taken.  Papers, on the other hand, are a different beast...    Our universal precautions lab turned out to be nothing more than a sterile technique demonstration on the part of our instructor, and the viewing of a CDC-produced video.  Actually got to leave a little early for a change, around 3:30!   We have a nursing history paper due no later than 8:30 on Tuesday morning.  If it comes in at even 8:31, our grade will be docked no less than 10%.  My topic?  Margaret Sanger, the birth control movement, her history/education/experiences and her contribution to nursing today.  I don't think this paper will be graded too harshly, as we've been advised by the prof that this is to help us introduce some basic elements of APA style.  Unfortunately, none of my earlier classes have used APA and I wasn't wise enough to learn it on my own.  Looks like we'll get an in-depth education into it these next two years, though.  Picked up a student loan refund check before leaving campus.  Nice to carry around that pseudo-cash for a while, pity it's all going to pay daycare.    Today's lectures were all about communication, listening, that sort of thing.  From assertive communication to interpreters, dealing with patients in distress/crying to responding to sarcasm.  Interesting stuff, and I could definately use to learn to be more assertive myself.    Goals for the weekend:  Get my paper written, and my furiously scribbled notes transcribed into a more neat typed format.  Thank goodness there's no prep (reading) assigned for our Monday group theory lecture.  Now it's off to have dinner with my parents, brother/SIL/their kids.  I don't turn down free food, especially when it's steak!   After that, I think the boys and I will head out to the next town over (25 miles) to spend the night with my in-laws.  My husband should be coming over there from his house sometime tomorrow...    Hope y'all have a great weekend.
