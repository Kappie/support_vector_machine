Okay so I am back in El Escorial from Barcelona.  Barcelona was okay, but um lets see, I had to stay in four star hotels, thats a long story I won´t go into now, I only prepaid 30 minutes at the internet cafe.  Um I went to the beach as planned friday and the sun was great and I could feel the tan coming, so I was like, well my buds are doing touristy things today, and we are all coming back tomorrow so I better call it a day early so I am ot fried tomorrow.  Yeah so I left we went out that night, yada yada yada, and then the next day we all met up etc. and went to the beach finally and the sun disappeared for the rest of the day about twenty minutes into it and the temp dropped to somewhere near 60 degrees, maybe less.  We toughed it out for about two hours then gave in and went to a Cuban joint I had been to last time off Barceloneta.  So that sucked I only have a baby tan thanks to quitting fake-baking before I left.  Then all was well until we were physically boarding the train, except Sarah lost her passport day one, but she fixed that within a day.  So anyway we are going through the detectors to board the train, and remember we had all five bought our train tix together, Felice went through 1st, then I did, so we were not far through, but yet on the other side, which these days is a significant distinction, when we heard drama behind us.  I put down my bag and turned to help with the spanish, because like all the train assholes I have had the joy of fighting with in the past they never speak english, even if they really do.  You know what I mean.  Anyway so I turn to see what I can do if anything and I sort of understand whats going on, eventually I realized when we got our tix the asshole in surprise surprise Atocha, fucking bastard, changed the month on the sweetest person ticket, Pam.  Pam is lovely and kind and sweet and quiet, so of course this B.S. happens to her and not someone like me who would probably deserve a little B.S. here and there.  They would not let her through and the train was physically departing in a couple minutes.  Before we could devise a game plan Pam had turned and dashed upstairs, alone, in Barcelona, without a spanish translator to deal with the most impolite assholes I have yet to encounter, shit even the gypsies that rob you are nicer, at least they take care to not disturb you, but here essentially the same had happened. Pam was robbed of her ticket, the right to employ its use was taken, and to be compensated they only returned half its value, a whopping less than 40€.  The deal with trains in Europe normally is that you pay some large price for one way, but the return if you get round trip in comparison to the first leg is minimal, i.e.  you may in some cases actually be paying around 80 € for the first part and maybe 1-5€ for the return, assinine plan, Yes, but thats the case normally.  But here they divided the trip by two and denied Pam a seat on a train they claimed full, which incidentaly wasn´t...rather half empty.  And I learned later when she went upstairs they told her all were full she eventually went back and forth from station to station crying and calling her mom collect, and she was alone, and I feel like a fucking asshole who should go to hell for being such a crappy friend, I could do nothing, I told off the interventor the man who denied her entry.  It wasn´t the denial that pissed me off, it was his reasoning and his blasted timing, what in all hell could she do with the train leaving immediately and the wait upstairs for tickets to the "sold out" (said with sarcasm) train taking more than 30 minutes to wait for in line upstairs.  So there she was.  The interventor is the newly created spanish position for the overseer of situations surrounding the boarding of passengers of trains at the security/inspection point.  He has the power to let people on the train should a mistake happen and the fault is the part of RENFE the spanish train comp.  He chose not to and his discretion was based more on a flexing of muscles and a clear enjoyment of creation of potentially erupting situations than anything else.  Felice, from houston and myself did everything said everything and since Tim was in first class he was let back through to run around and look for her, but she was not anywhere to be found, she was apparently waitng to be seen by an equivalent of customer service and equally sloth-like wait to be heard.  The asshole interventor only said when we said we bought the tix together, we bought them from the same place for the same place at the same time for the same time and since the month was incorrectly written on hers, that meant he made the mistake thus the mistake was renfe´s not hers and she should nto be punished for that which was essentially the fault of him, also the interventor.  He only said "demuestramelo"  "demuestramelo"  to everything we said.  We showed him our tix were the same from the same time and place, etc, that why would she get a ticket back for July when she leaves in a couple days for the US?  How could she stay in Barcelona, when she has class in El Escorial?  Also on the humanitarian side that she had never been to barcelona before, had class she had to be in tomorrow and did not speak spanish in order to communicate with those in a position to help her.  His answer:  "demustramelo."  He is a masochist.  EVIL.  Heartless, adn exactly what I have  encountered so many fucking times in damned train stations.  Pam went back and forth all day spending her 40€ on cab fare alone, and then finally later go to the airport and fought with a cab driver who was pissed at her for not being able to tell him what terminal, she kept sayin gany terminal.  She walked into the first airline she came across and said she needed the first flight to madrid.  We all got back and agreed to go together to tell professor Maloy, but everyone disappeared but Sarah who stood there as I grabbed the phone to break the news to the director.  He was nice about it, and not condemning of our futility, but kept me as the touch person in case of any change in situation.  We hadn´t eaten all day and sarah and I were teary on the Train after F. and I harassed the interventor every chance we had on the train, including, but not limited to a dramatic and embellished writing down of his name, etc. so everyone could see.  So after Maloy, we went for dinner, and we were sitting there and I was like she´s gonna be psised, what can we do?  We should send her flowers.  Then Pam walked around the corner and told us the story.  She had made it back.       Now on to my fun today.  My alarm did not go off, so I got up roughly 20 minutes before class.  GREAT.  Then I went to my hair appt. today and to gloss over the tragedy that has just befallen me-they fucked up royally.  They did exactly what I said not to do, and instead of fixing it they actually died it a second time the exact color I had said not to and four different adults, some middle-aged, and all professional hairdressers were actually yelling at me, truly and completely letting into me. I swear they wanted to see me cry, and god dammit it worked I cried, and they called me a stupid american among other things, and clearly the other clients didn´t like stupid blonde-haired, green eyed fucking americans, who asked to not have orange hair.  I was so polite, if not gentle and accepting, because I knew in the end the most important thing was me walking out of there with a haircolor I could stand to look at while I brushed my teeth.  This was intentional.  I´m serious, because they all had me crying and finally I was like no, this is screwed up. My week has sucked enough already and its only Monday.  I argued and told them what i wanted and reiterated that i said the same initially, and they are professionals, who I am sure are more than capable of fixing any color problem, and I wanted them to.  What did they do after screaming at me and telling me the color was not orange?, when oh hell yes it was!, I could have had a sunkist stamp on my head and passed myself off as the fruit.  And they all circled around  me and the hairbrushing bitch was truly, violently brushing me hair clearly ripping it out and watching the goddamned strands fall to the ground with a smirk, and there I was wide-eyed not sure what to do.  I could not believe it, I mean I have had some uncool things happen to me in Spain, but really this was too far fetched, too unbelieveable to even myself, as I sat in the chair watching, almost like I was a fly on the wall watching from a distance, and all I could remember was the Hoja de Reclamacion I had written on the train after what happened to Pam, "El tratamiento de viajeros estadounidenses" and I realized I was truly unhappy, not just depressed about the shittiness of what was happening, but that all this was wrong, it was wrong, and it was intentional and mean and fucking cruel and there I was in the chair with no one on my side. I felt alone.  Not homesick alone, but secluded from a society that while once was more, if not totally accepting, which now no longer even seemed to fake the guise of acceptance.  I am not Bush, I am not responsible, I did not vote for him, and my hair color is almost comical.  I mean it may actually be comical to everyone but me.
