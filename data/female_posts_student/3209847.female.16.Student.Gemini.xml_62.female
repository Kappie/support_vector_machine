Rock!  - Tomorrow, going to see Ashley at Johnny High's Country Music Revue. Good Luck Ashley! The whole family will be there.. oh god  Today I had sooo much fun. Work was a breeze because I worked with Sarah's Class, and they're cute! Sarah Slaughter that is.. not my girlfriend, hehe. We're all better now by the way from yesterday! Woohoo! After class, my mom came and picked me up (I know i'm still a little kid having to be picked up from work because i don't drive, boohoo) Sarah came and picked me up at 1:00, and we hung out at her house ALL day! What did we do!? We watched The Breakfast Club and My Big Fat Greek Wedding. We tried that Nair stuff. It works pretty well but it smells like SHIT and if your legs are dry, it stings a little bit for about 30 minutes. Its pretty easy though! We also went swimming which is always fun! Pigged out too.. yippy skippy! I'll never say that again..  We came back to my house and watched "This is Spinal Tap". It is hilarious! Everyone needs to see that movie! Hahaha, "Its more of a pastel black" *laughs* okay i'll stop rambling now! Tomorrow's friday! yay. Hope everyone had a great day and has another great day tomorrow! Oh, I'm almost 16..
