I don't get with the language...I mean, really.  Y'know?  But some things are disturbing...oh well, have fun.  I didn't warn you. Nice to see you're alive and well, Shine dearest.  So glad you haven't died on me...I would be so very sad, and lonely, and depressed...*sniffsobsniff* Of course you're a genius, G.  Who isn't?
