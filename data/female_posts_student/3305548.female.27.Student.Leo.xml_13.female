Brownies, cookies, chicken salad sandwiches, soda pop, raw veggie trays, more cookies....really an obscene amount of food. Then there is the media room.  Consisting of a few beat reporters from our one local newspaper, and one new representative from each of the major radio networks here in town, and the main news reporter for the TV station. Then me....stringing for a state news service. Moonlighting for one night. One newspaper guy has known me and my family since I was three years old. One girl there with the paper and I are co-alums from OU and were there at the same time...and I have met before when I had to get something from the paper when I was doing marketing work. The TV news reporter I have seen on the evening and morning news everyday since I was 5 or so. There was an air of small town celebrity about him that made me wonder when he got quite so old. I know both of the radio station representatives fairly well either by association or personal acquaintaince. It was a good old meeting of the minds if you will. All of these media folks look at each other as competition but they dont mind sharing computers or tidbits of information to get a story out or an interesting angle. How odd. At any rate. So there I am occassionally reloading and updating the networked website link, watching precints get added to the report. Some races are close...some are so distant I wondered if a candidate did any advertising whatsoever. One candidate is nicknamed "Icky." Seriously John "Icky" Doe - or whateveer his name was - was how it was listed. He got less than 50 votes.  Throughout the night...local candidates would sneak up behind me and check on their races....or public officials will check on their friends. "How's the so and so race?" "She/He is winning by a nose." "Oh good, she/he is me!" I stifled my laughter. I tried to give them hope, and reminded them that who new which precincts were in and maybe their district hasnt been tallied yet and what not...Me? Giving politicians pep talks? Yup. Will wonders never cease. I overheard an interesting interview from the county democratic party chair regarding Bush's Thursday visit to my region and the "welcome" the democrats have planned. Now that made me really smile.  I was given the chance to strut my state political and constitutional knowledge. One race tonight...a levy, had to win by 60% majority. It did not pass although it had a 57% majority vote. The reason is that my state's constitution requires any local or municipality or county tax to go up for public vote and must win by 60% majority - this was to prevent frivolous taxation of the people - other than the taxation imposed by the state government of course. And any change to the state constitution has to pass a similar test...and get a certain percentage of voter turn out. Talk about checks and balances. West Virginia being a state isnt even legal really...In order to succeed from Virginia the Congress of Virginia was to vote on the succession of any part of the state. Well, only the counties that were to be included in the succession's congress representatives did the vote - not all of the Virginia state representatives. They also held this vote in the expected new state capital - not the established Virginia state capital. And only in those counties did they hold the general succession election that had to pass by a popular election - the voters had to vote behind union troops lines, and the voting officials were allowing union non resident soldiers to vote to boot. There are a million holes in the formation of my state. But here we are with state representatives only in office for three months out of the year. But oy, I have gotten off subject. The primary election in my county had a 33% voter turn out. Its hard to motivate the voters for WV primaries because again of WV state law. When voting in WV primaries, you must vote your registered party. This means that independents have to vote for independents and if there are none (which is often the case...) they cant vote at all. Democrats and Republicans are also drawn down party lines. I am not sure as to the origin of this seemingly unconstitutional law....but it sure makes people think before declaring themselves an Independent or any other non traditional party for that matter. My job for the night was simple...occassionally call and update a news service on the eletion standings for specific state and county and local races. Simple. Straightforward. Important sounding. I figure that is enough rambling about small town elections. Suffice to say that it was a night of being in a roomful or building full of people who either know my dad, my mom, my step dad, my bio dad, or someone related to me in some way. I got directons to the house I spent time in from the ages of 3 to 4 or so. I got to hear stories about my mom and me when I was three. I got to "hobnob" with the nobbiest nobs you can find around here....and I got some good small town gossip and a good chicken salad recipe to boot.  -Mack
