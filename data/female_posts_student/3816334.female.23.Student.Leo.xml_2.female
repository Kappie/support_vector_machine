Two more weeks of this and I am going to be soooooo ready to go home. Just think on days that i am not working at shaws i will outside in the sun laying by the pool and sleeping all day long. Gearing up for what one can only assume will be a fantasic school year. please take time to note the sarcasm.  im just so tired of feeling like i am wasting time or letting time pass me by you know? when  is it all  going to fall in place, and you know what i am talking about, you too are wondering when the life you wake up to in the morning will be our own and not some warped variation of. When  you finally get up in the morning and think: Holy Christ i am finally doing what i love, living with who i love and building our life together.   i have more to say but im so fucking tired i just can't write anymore.more to follow
