It gives me such warmth to know that others, similiar to myself, are suffering from the daily rigors of life. Seriously. And I'm suffering. I went and talked to the leasing office here yesterday and almost started crying. It was very unsettling to hear that they will probably not keep my rent the same, but will raise it 100 dollars. This may or may not be the case as I am not up for re-newal yet. September 1st. I managed not to cry in the office and tried my hardest in the elevator as I had company, but as soon as I got to floor 6, the tears came. And came. And came. And went. Provided that my rent stays the same, I could stay here. But I won't. So why I got upset and still get upset, I don't know. I don't want to work once practicum begins and I'd have to to live here. So I've been looking, but as the apartment locator guy says, I'm too early. So I'm gonna wait. Try to wait til mid September. I'll probably look tomorrow.  Finally the professor decided to cut the quizzes. When we only had 2 left. Nice. He also gave us our reports back and stated his displeausre of how the class is doing. I'm displeased. He took off 5 points for grammar errors. Too many "that's", incorrect punctuation, and misplacements of (.) before citations. How did I know that APA has their own unique way of punctuation? I should have had my report edited. So I got 52 out of 60 points or an 85. My friend, who I call the tramp now, scored a 59.5 out of 60. Must be nice. I still have an "A", barely, but I do. Although I heard my professor rambling that grades don't matter once out of school. They stress me out.
