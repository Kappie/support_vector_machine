Honing myself into an ass-kicking machine at Taekwondo is wearing poor lil' ol' me out.    But anywho, things between Joel and me have never been better.  We've worked out all the problems and such, so we like each other again.  The 24th birthday is approaching.  I'm okay with that.  Birthdays don't really mean much between 21 and 30, do they?  I'm not very excited about it.  I like it when people five me stuff, so I guess I can manage to get a little excited about it, but not much.  I usually know what everyone is getting me, so I get sad because there are no surprises...but like I said, I'll be a little excited.  Alright, I know, boring post.  But hey, I'm a boring gal.  More later!
