I felt sorry for him because he had just got home from work and was stressing out about that. So I went in my room as he went into his to get on his laptop. Keep in mind that my room is right next to his.  So I get on the computer, put in my Yellowcard CD and switch it to a song called Life Of A Salesman. Here it is:  What's a dad for dad? Tell me why I'm here dad Whisper in my ear that I'm growing up to be a better man, dad Everything is fine dad Proud that you are mine dad Cause I know I'm growing up to be a better man  Father I will always be That same boy that stood by the sea And watched you tower over me Now I'm older I wanna be the same as you  What's a dad for dad? Taught me how to stand, dad Took me by the hand and you showed me how to be a bigger man, dad Listen when you talk, dad Follow where you walk, dad And you know that I will always do the best I can I can  Father I will always be (always be) That same boy that stood by the sea And watched you tower over me (over me) Now I'm older I wanna be the same as you The same as you  Father I will always be That same boy that stood by the sea And watched you tower over me Now I'm older I wanna be the same as you  (When I am a dad, dad I'm gonna be a good dad Do the best you could, dad Always understood, dad Tell me I was right, dad Opened up my eyes, dad Glad to call you my, dad Thank you for my dad)  Usually bands sing about how their father's ditched them and shit. My brother Eric played this for my dad a couple months ago and it made him cry. How sweet is that? Anyways, I played that song while he was in his room. About an hour later, he knocks on my door, and was like "Did you play that song for me?" And I nodded my head and smiled. He was like "Thank you." And he gave me a huge hug. Aw man I'm about to cry thinking about it lmao. It really made him happy.  I'm in Behind The Wheel as you know, where you drive around with another student and instructor. Well, Josh usually drives to where ever we're going and I drive back. On the way back, I'm like, can we please go see my mom? I wanna give her a hug. Since we're already going to go by where she works I figured it'd be a nice surprise for her. So he's like yea I guess, just make it fast. So I park the car and walk into Minnieland.{It's a child daycare center} And I walk in and I'm like is Patti here? And the women are like are you her daughter? And I'm like yea and I told them my name and one lady was like, just a moment let me go get her.  About three minutes past and my mom came out laughing and smiling and walking fast towards me with her arms open and I gave her the best hug ever. She was smiling so wide it was great. And then she came out to meet my driving instructor and before I left, I gave her another big hug.  When I got home from school a couple minutes ago, I was like, so I guess you liked the surprise? And she's like, that was one of the best hugs I've ever gotten from you, and I'd like another if that's okay. I was like yes! So I hugged her again. All in all, it's been a fucking great day. I have to go to work at 4 though but that's okay. Nothing's going to ruin my great mood!  MUCH much love!
