Just so my lj friends don't get swamped in my self-destructive tendencies.   So.  First up fuck I feel like cutting and fuck I'm an idiot. I went and looked at the ritual cutting section of BME and it just fucked me up worse. I shouldn't have but its just not going away. I always do this when Nova is out. No-ones home and I feel like shit. I'm not going to but I feel like a failure just wanting to.   Second in line is the poems I wrote. That got reviewed by some dick who didn't want to face what the poems were about.  this is the poem:  memory slips hit me for six trip me up and send me down  sitting sweet soft and gentle but allofasudden your sweet                                     sweet scent is overwhelmed by the stench of lust                                            and I'm choking on pillow dust  a hand on my neck  holding me down  a traitor’s voice telling me I'm going to love it  while my every fibre screams           no  allofasudden your warm                                     soft breath sounds harsh in my ear hot on my face                                     and that voice is whispering my pain                                     and deadening my nerve  and I stop saying                                              no allofasudden I'm broken violated alone in my head allofasudden I remember  and you are gone replaced by a screaming memory slipping through my senses   this is part of the crit:  “stench” – I think I said this last time, stench has negative connotations that don’t work for me.    "and that voice is whispering my pain and deadening my nerve" - not sure why you had it spaced out here, and found this quite lack lustre.  "and I stop saying no" - not enough lead-up, and seems to contradict the previous line, this person whispers your pain…. And that is a good thing?    I edited my original version because I though the meaning wasn't quite clear but it turns out the reviewer is an idiot. *sigh* Maybe it is shit, it wouldn't surprise me since I'm no poet, but I didn't think I'd buried the meaning that deep.   Is it just me or does it seem like the reviewer is a bloke. Two girls who commented got the meaning, one from the original one from the rewrites.  The whole thing has been fucking me up for days, as has another discussion elsewhere. I guess I'm just fucked up. And the spacing won't work properly. Fuck it.
