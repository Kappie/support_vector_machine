I had myself convinced that it was Friday and it was time to get up, and then, navigating through ways how it couldn't be Friday, I finally remembered the play and putting up signs and disengaged the panic switch. But eh, 5:30. And bed at 1. I'm too old for this shit.  And Happy Tales just had to be mega-boring today...stupid Mainstreet Festival. God. There was practially no one there. I did three adoptions today...the last time I was there, I did twelve. So you can imagine what you have to do the whole time to keep your eyes open...anything, really. The dogs get tired and sit down, the ladies are all pretty old so they'll sit and talk about good old old people things, people will come in and leave pretty fast...blah. And now it's time for a good old paper. I hate this weekend. Yay for SAT IIs next weekend. Shit.  Raugh.
