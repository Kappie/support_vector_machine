"you wouldn't have done it the way i wanted anyhow." fuck you. why would you ask me to do something, if you knew i was going to screw up?? like, i'm (almost) sixteen, and i doubt they're going to let me drive. heaven forbid they're going to have to  trust  me! they just don't understand that i can make my own descisions.  oh yeah, don't forget, no climbing until school's over! fucking parents. they think i spend too much climbing, and not enough time doing schoolwork. either that, or they tell me i have a problem.
