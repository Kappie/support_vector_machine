But its all good as long as it doesn't do it again! Hmm what else has happened? I found out Brianna can't come up! HOW SAD IS THAT? But we do get to see each other later in the school year so that is a wonderful thing! I can see my cutie. : ) hmm  what a great thought. I'm missing a week of swim while I am uhere which is somewhat depressing. However I do get to come home on Sunday. I  really  want to come home but I also want to stay here. If  I go home I have to get use to the normal way of life where I have to do chores, get a job, go to school, have people you think are your friends yell at you, but there are good points so I'm thinking about those! I hope senior is great and goes by fast! Then I can move! lol Yea I think I will stop whinning. Oh me and Chrissy spent they day together....its amazing how much family has in common! Yeah it was fun we ended up malesting ice cream cones and accidentally taking out little kids with drumsticks. : / haha It was funny thou! Think that is about it spent two days with both of my grandma's that was fun.....It's also nice to know that your cousins still hate you and probably always will.... Hmmm yeah thats its! BYE
