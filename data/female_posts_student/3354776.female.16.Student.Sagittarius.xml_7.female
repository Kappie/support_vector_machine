Hang on to the things you really want to keep.   I hate having ppl borrow my stuff. Sue has borrowed my markers on Tuesday. I had her promise she would give em back on Wendesday. I had her promise that there would be 50 markers. She still has them. Today she also said she would come by my house to give them to me. Don't make promises if you aren't sure you aren't gunna keep em. Don't amke excuses. I don't care. A promise is a promise. And you broke it.
