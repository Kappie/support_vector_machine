I mean seriously...a year?!    I am so mad, but it does not make sense for me to get mad or to be bitter, I know this is what my husband and I signed up for and I have to support him in the best way I know possible.  I will miss him and I will worry about him, but I know that it is all in God's hands.  Oh to be a wife...all the struggles, the sacrifices...oh what can I do...being a wife isn't hard, it is being a wife of a Navy Corpsman that is my struggle now...I know why we do it, I just wish it weren't so dangerous.  That is what Iraq is...dangerous...I know Ed is a great man and he knows his job and I am so very proud of him.  I just hope that he will be okay.  I am also thinking about Bailey, he had such a hard time with his dad being away for 4 months, but now he will be gone for a year...how do you explain that to the children?  UGH  I am just sitting here thinking of ways to break this to the kids...hopefully they change their minds and say that he will only be gone for 6 months...I can keep hoping, right?    Well I pray and hope that they don't send these guys out for a year...it isn't good for their morale and for the the well-neing of the families involved, but don't get me wrong, these families are the strongest families you will ever meet...they will not compalin, they will vent, but they will stand by their spouses and keep on going...they will hold the house together and the family together until they come back home.  Well this was just my vent...
