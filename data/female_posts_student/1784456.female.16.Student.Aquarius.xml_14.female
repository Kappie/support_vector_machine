The wind was howling howlingly (howl-howl) in great howling howls, and the owl was hooting (hoot-hoot) like a great hooting...thing. Speaking of things.... there was a thing. It was the thingyest thing in the history of thingy-thing like thingy-things. It moved across the ground as thingyly as a thing... THEN it took from it's pocket.... a thing of things! but this was not just any thing of things.... this thing of things was the thing.... OF THING! (THING is a thingy-type-place in the forbiddon land of the land of thing.) The thing carrying the thing of thing-like-things from thing in the land of thing was... The Izzy-thing!  This Izzy-thing was the most beaytiful, brave, daring, truthful...loyal...friendly...generous thing. The Izzy-thing was on her way to the thingy-type-place called THING in the forbidding land of thing with a thing of thing-like things BECAUSE (this is where it gets interesting honest) she had been commanded by the all-powerful thing to put them in the smelly-toilet of the Evil Katie-Thing (told you) so that they would explode into smelly-thing-like-things and cover the Katie-thing and the THING in the forbidding land of thing in green smelly-thing. AND SHE DID. THE END
