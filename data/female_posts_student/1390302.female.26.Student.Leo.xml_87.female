Our claim to be a morally and religiously righteous country of good wholesome middle-class suburbanites is on the decline.    It is most likely that the citizens of other countries look on America as the holy grail of good government, while their governments have labeled us the proverbial playground bully.  Adhere to American standards and ways of life or die!    It’s wrong.  Other countries have every right we do to their own moral and ethical substructure!  They have every right we do to form their own way of life and government based on traditions that have worked for them for thousands of years.  So why does America believe it’s our right to go in and kick the ass of anyone who is different from us?  Was America not built on diversity and difference, in the common goal of escape from the tyranny of an uncaring king?  The answer is yes, we were.  Now, in light of the fact that Americans have been caught hurting peoples of other countries simply because they could, I am forced to wonder, if they have that much time on their hands, why are they there at all?  In my opinion this folly by American troops proves that our time in Iraq is coming to an ultimate needed end.    In one case, a Texas Republican Senator said that yeah, the tapes were bad but they deserved it because they did worse to our people.  In my opinion, there is no justification for what happened, none!  Americans do not do these things, Americans do not torture POW’s; Americans do not hurt others for the sake of enjoyment.  From where I stand, these actions by American soldiers make them no better than the “Enemy.”  I begin to wonder who the “enemy” actually is?  We’ve captured Saddam, so what’s left Bin Laden?  But wait, wasn’t he our enemy from the very beginning?  One would think so, especially in light of the Al-Quaida’s actions against American on 9/11.  So why wasn’t he our prime target from the beginning?  I believe that was what the UN, Germany,  France were trying to figure out.  Now it is true that Saddam Hussein was a mad man.  It was true that he was oppressing and torturing his own people for his own sick, twisted political scheming.  Yes, he was a homicidal tyrant; that was never in dispute.  Had George W. Bush just said we want him out because he’s a killer totalitarian perhaps he would have gotten more support from Congress, the UN, France, and Germany…perhaps?  So now we are looking for weapons of mass destruction and I would be willing to bet that the Bush administration will find them just in time for the election.  How do we, the little men –aka American citizens- know that the weapons have actually NOT yet been found?  The answer is that we know solely based on the word of George W. Bush and his administration.   George W. Bush, the president who has nearly from the beginning, been unwilling to tell us anything.    I am not voting for G.W. Bush again, that’s for sure!  Not to mention reports which say that George W. had an axe to grind with the Middle East when he entered the oval office.  People from the inside saying that he had intended to go to war with them from before day one.  I would believe it now, though I wouldn’t have then.  Isn’t it strange how one’s perception of the truth can change over time?
