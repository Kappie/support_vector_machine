The clouds are kind of a a light pink, and tinged with cream! The are like floating puffs of candy floss! And then there is a part of a rainbow, it reminds me of the calm before the storm! Yes thats it they are storm clouds, oh I can only hope they don't live to recognise there title! I am a fan of storms, but in  WINTER  when you can stay in bed under your duvet, drinking tea and watching a crap movie. But not in the summer  PLEASE . I want the summer to return outside instead of just in my head!!!!!!!!!!  I can see blue sky trying to break through.  Hmmm amaybe just maybe this is the most beautiful I have ever seen our skies look, but no, actually there have been more magnificent times, but this is one of the top 20!!  My swing looks so tempting out there.....  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
