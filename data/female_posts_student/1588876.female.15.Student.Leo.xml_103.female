GET OUT. NOW. INTRUDERS UNWELCOME.  if something i decide to do doesnt affect you, then dont make it as if it does. what's the point? if it doesnt have any impact on your life whatsoever, then butt out, butt first. it makes no sense to me. what is wrong with people?  but, if you simply  must  involve yourself in other people's lives, maybe you should tell that person, instead of going around telling everyone else  but   that person. that accomplishes nothing. nothing but drama. stop the drama. for the love of god, be chill.  stop your terrorist attacks on my world's trade centers. stop your drama. stop your intrusions. just stop.
