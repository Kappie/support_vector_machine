I am an equal opportunity hater and a super bitch with a wicked case of PMS....pay no mind to the girl behind the blog.  I watched Dawson's Creek the series finale and I weeped like a fucking little bitch.  What can I say, that corny teen melodrama shit really melts my icy heart.  I'm stoked that its Friday tomorrow 'cause I'm broke and money would be super right about now.   I've started reading a lot of blogs lately (not just the ones linked here) and you people are funny as hell and some of you are very interesting.    My cat's breath smells like cat food.    That is all.
