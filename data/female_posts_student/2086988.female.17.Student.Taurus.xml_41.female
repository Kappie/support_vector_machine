See, my mom really doesn't want to take us, she wants us to go in the summer, which we can too =P. But, since she won't go, my dad mentioned my sister taking us, which would be so much better. So I called Candace, and omg she's so for it! She's already planning on when we can leave, if we're flying or driving, car rental, hotel, all that. Which shes good at looking for plane tickets, so if she can't find any cheaper than $249, we'll just drive the 10 hrs. So if we fly, she's planning on us leaving in the evening on March 4th and coming back late Monday night on the 8th. If we drive, we'd leave early March 5th and probably come back on Tuesday the 9th. So just gotta wait and see on that. Now, all that we really need to do is talk it out with my parents, which since Candace is willing to take us, and it was they're idea for her in the first place, all things should be go. I was like is it a good possibly we can go, and Candace was like yea, it is. So yay!!!! But, me and Kiera have to watch Kayla and Christain anytime for Candace, with no pay, that was my bargin to get her to go and it worked! Hey, I'll watch them, I don't care what I'd have to do see David, as long as I get to go, wahooness!!!!!!   In your eyes I see the missing pieces I'm searching for I think I found my way home
