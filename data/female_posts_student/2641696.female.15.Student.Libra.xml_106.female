So now Z and I are sitting across from each other in the library, and this is not the most splendid way to spend 3 hours. *sigh* I am not happy with this. In fact, I'm rather mad. *growls*   But A chopped all her hair off! She looks much older, scarier and punk-ish. She needs to wear spikes and dye her hair black. And a worn leather jacket, and some baggy t-shirt with a swear word on it or something. Maybe she could just borrow MG2's clothes? ^^; I am very proud of her for cutting it off!! Very brave. It's hard to get rid of all your hair after having it long for a while.   Umm... so yes, my dog is sick. I'm going to try not to talk about this, because it makes my eyes all watery -.-   I have nothing more to say (blah), so I'll just wander the net and be dumb.. *cheers half-heartedly*
