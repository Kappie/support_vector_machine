In that case, I may have to sleep over her house tonight. That's ok, as long as I can go over later. I think me, My Dad and Margo are going out to dinner tonight for Father's Day. Margo said we shouldn't go on Father's Day because every restaurant would be really crowded. Ok, I'm gonna go lay down. I'm really dizzy and tired.
