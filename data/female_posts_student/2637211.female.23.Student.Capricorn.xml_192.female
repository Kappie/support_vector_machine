He only started to suspect when he saw John's car out front, then wondered what the heck was going on. It was awesome. As we left, he said it was the best party ever. Sweet.  Now today I need to write a paper and email it in when I'm done. Hopefully that will all work out well, I just need to get writing! It's a very theoretical topic, and I'm having a bit of a hard time getting it going. But I have a clear outline, so I think I'll start writing and then write my intro. That seems to be where I'm confused, so I guess I should just write it after I know what I mean!
