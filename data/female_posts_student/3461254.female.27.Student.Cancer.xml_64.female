Fortunately, it's the slow time of year and I've been on a cleaning kick.  I've been working on the Introduction to Law take-home final exam for the past few days and it's due at 7:00.  Unfortunately, "working on" doesn't exactly mean finishing, or even making a dent.  Good thing for me--I'll channel all my nervous energy and procrastination skills for a big brain power explosion due to hit in a few hours.  I'll work through lunch and for an hour after work.  I don't think there's too much to worry about.
