Clearly, all it is a sign of is the fact that you're a complete drug addict, psychotic loser.    I don't care if you're "over Reenie", I don't care how many times or on what precious thing you swear you'll never cheat on me again.  I don't care that you'll never raise your hand to me or yell at me again.  I know you won't do any of this anymore becuase I'm not ever going to give you the chance to.    I'm through with you, I've BEEN through with you, I have found someone so far superior to you in every aspect that he makes your mere existence seem like a cruel, cruel joke to the world.  You had the best thing you could have ever imagined and thankfully for me, you didn't realize it so now I've gotten away from you and I'm done, through, finished.    Please stop calling me or I will have the lovely people at nextel block you from calling me, and should you try to call me from Colleen's phone, I will have a harassment complaint filed against you.  You are  so  last summer....no, you are so last lifetime.  You suck, go get your own life and stay out of mine.  Its like  urlLink Maroon 5  said: " Does it make you sad to find yourself alone?  And does it make you mad to find that I have grown?  I'll bet it hurts so bad to see the strength that I have shown.   Hoping to never hear from you again, Gwen
