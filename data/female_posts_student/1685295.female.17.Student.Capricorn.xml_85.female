Tried to find that kitten . . .someone's been feeding it something besides cat food - I really hope people realize that with kittens this can kill them.  They get diarrhea and die.  It's pretty serious . . .but I guess they have good intentions.  Kitten might still be there.  Who knows?  Interesting thoughts to ponder. . . If this is the fall and decline of the Roman Empire, then as with the last time it's from the inside out.  And if that's true, then the twenties feeling is coming back into the rising generations.  Just an interesting thought, any comments welcome.  All right, *yes*, I admit the whole visitors who don't comment thing is just *odd* to me. ^_^  And I passed by a motion sensor light this evening and when it went dark I thought I had inadvertantly caused *another* black out.  It was kind of funny.
