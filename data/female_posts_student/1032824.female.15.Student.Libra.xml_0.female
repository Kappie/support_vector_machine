There's a count-down script, photo gallery and a tag-board at the right hand side of the page. (More to come) Til' then, take care and all the best for your prelims.  " Dream the dreams that have never been dreamt. " -- David Bower     The Six Mistakes of Man  1. The delusion that personal gain is made by crushing others. 2. The tendency to worry about things that cannot be changed or corrected. 3. Insisting that a thing is impossible because we cannot accomplish it. 4. Refusal to set aside trivial preferences. 5. Neglecting development and refinement of the mind, and not acquiring the habit of reading or studying. 6. Attempting to compel others to believe and live as we do.
