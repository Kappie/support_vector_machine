I finished Hillary's book, and now I've moved on to Bill O'Reilly's 'The No-Spin Zone.'  It's a good read.  More to the point and less drawn out than Hillary Clinton's book.  Maybe I like this book better because I like  him  better.  Anyway, I'm just going to shut-up now.  I probably won't update again until after school starts.  I know I'm going to hate high school.  Talk to you later.......
