No worries, though, as everything is great with Garth. I just have to live the rest of my life, the parts that I've been neglecting these past couple of weekends when I've been in Boston.  I love getting packages. When I arrived back at good old 20B, there was a package from Amazon awaiting my return. Score - it was the new Ashlee Simpson CD, Autobiography. Okay, I"ll admit it. I love "Pieces of Me". And, I am currently semi-addicted to Ashlee's MTV reality show (and her sister's as well, since I seem to be divulging all). I've been grooving to her CD off and on for the past few hours. Good times. And chomping down on Double Chocolate Milano cookies.  It seems as though Operation: Garth's Birthday present will have to wait until tomorrow.
