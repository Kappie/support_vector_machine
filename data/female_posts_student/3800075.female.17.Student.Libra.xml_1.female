(?)  Anyhoo we just got back from the cabin- it was a good night. no party just kinda sat and hung out by the lake fire. So we were out there right.... and nathan had his guitar and was playing and i was totally content. i couldnt have been anymore happy just sitting and doing nothing besides listening to him and gazing at the stars, lake and fire (and perhaps his eyes a time or two). We ended up taking him home about 500 AM because hegot really sick and didnt bring his inhaler. but it was cool cuz we got to see the sun come up- kinda- and the ride was pretty schweet.Aww what a beautiful kid. I love watching him play. I love how he gets pissed off if his guitar is not tuned just so... and how he will sit there and try to tune it, by ear, for hours. Hegets so intowhat he is doing, and rightly so, he can play that thing like nobody's business.  Arg.  you can stopreading here because im just going tovent right now.   I love the way hehas the coolest comments, or when we're being silly and he changes his voice- as we all tend to do- I love that he is the most polite person ive ever met. He asked if he could take his pants off when we were going to bed andhe was on the otherside of the room for godsakes. I love that he is laid back and "an indecisive bastard" as he put it. I love that he has so much talent and is actually doing something with it and i hope they (he and joeetc.) will get out of anaconda and go somewhere with it. I love that he writes his songswith different perceptionsof different people and i love when he sings- even if sometimes its a little off keyhe still has anice voice(Im always out of key). A nice voice in general for that matter- what is it with me and voices?  I love the fact that he would have slept on the rollaway, instead of the bed,if i wouldnt have insisted on taking it. I really love that i can remember one of my favorite things he ever said, give or take- "Im not a tough guy or anything, but I seriously wanted to kick his ass" haha ( i dont know why that stayed with me but it did.) I love that he feltsorry becauseHE wasso sick he couldnt sleep, and thought it was an inconvience to take himhome (I wish i could have helped him, he sat outside coughing up his lungs for quite awhile and i felt really bad) Aww.... Im such a loser.  Until Time Next
