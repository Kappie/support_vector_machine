All the puma hsoes were wayyyyy to expensive.  Then we went to Ikea.  Man, thats a crazy store. I got a framed photograph of this bridge, lake, and mountain thing. It so pretty and peaceful.  Then I got a bunch of frames for these cool cards I got at the glass museum. they have awesome quotes on them. My favorite is "Do one thing everyday that scares you." Elanor Rooseavelt said that! She is one cool lady.   Then I got two prety candles. My mom wont let me light them in my room but they are still cool.   My new room is gonna be awesome.   See, on one half its gonna be like crazy guitar rock-ish. Then we have these windows that are currently in our dining room and they are from about 1890 and they are pretty thin and everything so I am going to get three of them and hang them from the ceiling and that will be the transformation to a place of sitll tranquility, or as I call it, my "Misty Haven" :)  I am so excited.   So, after Ikea we were driving home and we get this call and my grandfather was back in surgery and now he is in the ICU.  I doubt any of you know but about a week or too he had a small heart attack so he had to have a triple bypass surgery to get his heart all cleared up. So we has doing fine then he started to feel a bunch of pain so he went back to the doctors and we had a really had infection from the surgery and he had like a "super bug" or something.   SO, thats what my life has been filled with.  He has had baout three surgerys all lasting more than 5 hours.  Not fun.  So now he is totally unconcious.  If he dies it will be absolutely unbearable.   See, this happened to my Grandma two years ago and her brian had so much damage that she can't think right. Not to add any humor to this situation, but she is a lot like Dory from finding nemo.  So if my grandpa dies I don't know who will take care of her.  :(
