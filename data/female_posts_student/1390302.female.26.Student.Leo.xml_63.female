Everyone knows who Dr. King was and what he did for the African American Civil Liberties Movement.  Its only right that there should be a day for the man, he did a good deal to help us realize that the color of your skin does not make you who you are and that people are people, inside.    Still, in light of this, racism still flares around the world.  Yet it’s not just of racism that I speak, it’s of Sexism and Anti-Gay rights people.  Racism and Sexism have been the oldest ‘-ism’s’ in the book, yet they are not all.    African Americans still face racism in a good many states in this country from day to day.  And I, who would love to be an optimist (I’m not by the way, I live in a glass is half full world), shake my head. I shake my head at the utter ignorance that shines in the eyes of every single racist, anyone who is willing to use the “N word” or any racial slang to describe his fellow man.  It’s disgusting!  So what about Sexism?  Sexism is a huge problem not just in America but in every country around the world.  Mothers in Asia drowning their daughters because they see women as less than men.  Scorned men in the middle east throwing acid on the face of a 14 year old girl because she rejected his advances.  Women in African, the Middle East, and Far East being sexually mutilated in a practice called “female circumcision.”  The list goes on…  For what?  Why does this happen?  Because women are less than men are?  Not in my eyes, yet in the eyes of some your gender makes you less.  Even here in America where women make statistically less money than men for the exact same work and with the same education.  In America, women are considered a minority, not because there are less of us, but simply because we are have less money than white men.  Granted, I have it slightly easier than some women do, I am white.  That doesn’t make it right.   Even in my own life I deal with Sexism, not from my husband but from my father in law.  I have a father in law who believes that women should be seen and not heard.  It’s a common view among southern men of his age.  I hate it!  The man never speaks to me, and when I speak to him he neither answers nor acknowledges my having spoken.  It tends to be unnerving at times, not to mention disgruntling.  Yet in this situation I am helpless to change the factors.  You can’t teach an old dog new tricks as they say, and my father in law is never going to look at me as more than some woman married to his son.  Okay, So I believe I am through with my civil liberties rant for the time being.  The bottom line is that we all need to stop being so oblivious and cold toward the problem and treat every human being whom acts like a human being, like a human being.
