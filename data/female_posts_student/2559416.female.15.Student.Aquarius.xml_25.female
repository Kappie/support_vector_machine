       
      Blake has lured you into this dark alleyway. As you wait for your eyes to adjust, you feel something brush against your neck. There is a slight popping noise, of fangs sinking into your veins. You are paralysed, while the blood drains from your body. As the fangs retract, you feel a new strength, and a new coldness in your limbs. You have joined the ranks of the undead.
