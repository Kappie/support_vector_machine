OctoberPrl: haha mao 3 16: some of us thought you looked like a shisiedo model  OctoberPrl: whatever! mao 3 16: i know mao 3 16: that's what i said! OctoberPrl: hahahaha mao 3 16: i was like.. hellz nah mao 3 16: hahhaha.. i guess the lighting was really bad.  OctoberPrl: now imma gonna have to copy and paste that onto my xanga mao 3 16: and they left too much up to the imaginatio.   i didn't even know shiseido has models...but yeah, this is why i never go on IM anymore. the hours just fly by. i mean, who can resist when ppl be saying stuff like this to me all the time?? hahaha. soooooo kidding!!  as i walking in the park tonight, i heard this thumping music coming from my alma mater and realized that it was probably the back to school Hello dance. i can't believe it's been five years since high school, eight years since i first started going to whitney. i'm such an old geezer. it doesn't seem that far away though. i must have a real good memory cuz everything is still crystal clear. i dunno why ppl always say that high school was a traumatic experience and they were so glad to get out. personally, i liked it, and i liked whitney. so there.  my test is in two weeks. o man, saying that makes my bowels loosen. g'nite.
