Today was kind of a drag. Everybody's stress is overflowing into my own, and now it's driving me nuts. All of a sudden, people are panicking about AP Tests, SATs coming up, finals, author projects, etc. We actually have only six weeks of school left, believe it or not...but the worst is yet to come. So much shit is taking place at once, not only academically concerned. SHIT, I CAN'T WAIT FOR SUMMER!! Oh yeah--that will be filled with college prep shit, too. Lucky us.  What's exciting about today? No homework! (Well, technically.) I need a break after writing for the author project last night and doing that stupid History outline for the lazy, selfish dimwits in History who so  conveniently  forgot to do their parts today! Now we're left with less study material for the final on Friday. People are so fucking thoughtful sometimes, it makes tears well up in my eyes. So anyway, I'm planning on getting some well-deserved shut eye tonight after my 2:30am rendez-vous last night and the 6:30am awakening to make up the rest of a test this morning. Sleep deprivation isn't going to help much with my stress, so I'll do as much as I can to at least stay awake in class. Until next time.
