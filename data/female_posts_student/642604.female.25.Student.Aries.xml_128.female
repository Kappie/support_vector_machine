You have picked up on me being out with a friend... or a good aquaintence rather... one night and you have turned it into something ridiculous and unheard of.  As much as I love the kid you've picked up on you couldn't be more wrong and now all you are doing is hurting me with these nonsensical accusations.  I have tried to explain that this friend or aquaintence of mine or whatever you want to call him is just that and really you have no idea how ridiculous the notion of us being together really is, and you won't listen.  I am so tired of this.  And on top of it all, even if it was more or even if there was someone else it would be none of your business as I reiterate... WE ARE NOT TOGETHER!  So since I  know you check this and I am not going to call you till you are calm and maybe even, God forbid, rational about this, you should not call me as I will no longer be listening to your voicemail.
