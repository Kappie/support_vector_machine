Just have to give him some penacillin (gawd I can't spell) and drain the wound periodically. My step-dads dog got sick but she's alright now, I think anywayz. Other then that theres not much to say. I've recently become very involved in Astrology and learning as much about it as possible.       The Zodiac is truley facinating, AND I LOVE THE SYMBOLS, lol. This isn't the order of the wheel but the order of the Zodiac:   Aries  The Ram   Tarus  The Bull   Gemini  The Twins (MY SIGN!!! ^_^)   Cancer  The Crab   Leo  The Lion (Boyfriends sign!)   Libra  The Scales of Justice   Virgo  The Virgin   Scorpio  The Scorpian   Sagittarius  The Archer   Capricorn  The Goat   Aquarius  The Water Carrier   Pisces  The Fishes    I love the signs. Did you know Zodiac means Little Animals? I find that interesting ^_^ Didn't know that till recently. And that Aquarius is an Air sign not water ^_^ Thats new to me too. And that scorpio is Water :P CRAZY lol.
