I could be skiing tonight, but maybe I'll just lay in bed and pretend I'm a mole. I'll just cuddle deep into the blankets in a dark embrace consumed with the smell of warmth. True to a mole, I am blind when it comes to the world. I think when I just think I've figured something out, I'm tossed a hardball and I never quite comphrehend it once again. I feel like I'm so young looking at everything and I can't fully see the big picture.   What triggers this is my jealousy towards situations and people. Jealousy is not always a bad thing, actually it encourages friendly competation at times... but at others...it has a nasty streak of green which likes to flair up at certain times. Sometimes I feel jealous towards people because of what they have, or who they have. It's a natural reaction to something you want for the sake of wanting it.   I'm not sure...why I have these feelings sometimes. But! who really understands the female mind...or even the teenage brain. Sometimes I'm jealous of Martin and Kate, Jane and Paul because of the love they all seem to have for each other and everyone involved. I sit back sometimes and wish I could have someone in love with me as much as Martin is with Katie. I have alot of respect for these four people as I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that I love them. I love them every much and maybe its because I see them in a non-judgemental way and in a positive manner that I compare myself to them. Thats one of the main problems of myself. I compare myself to others. I put myself up against others who have different strengths...and weaknesses.   For the longest time I compared myself to Dana, who was someone in my eyes who I just wanted to emulate. I wanted to be as smart and as talented as him. Did I ever stop to realize that I slowly was transforming myself and become less of me and more like him. I found some things along the way that I actually did enjoy. I really enjoy barenaked ladies, politics, acroynms, and assorted other stuff.   And time management...I joined Team Youth because I felt I should. I felt pressured into it and I'm losing interest very quickly. We never do anything...and well. At times I feel this is a pointless organization because what the fuck do we seem to be doing? I know I made a committment to the organization at the beginning of the year, but sometimes I just don't want to go and do anything. I want to lay at home and sleep and just be alone. I don't want to be around anyone. This means that I have to send fucking Kelly an email explaining my schedule. How do you explain that you just don't want to be part of anything because you want to be depressed and boring and lick all your wounds that lately have had salt pressed deep into them. How do you explain that you would rather sit home alone on a friday evening typing in your blog than interacting with people because you know if you interact with people there is tension, or theres a chance there could be a problem.  So I'm going to work tonight for Vic actually. Have to be there for 5pm. I'm washing my clothing...geezus. If I would have known then I wouldn't have washed it. I have to schedule some damn appointments tonight!   I just want to cry. I want to find something and hold tight. I'm rebounding.   In short, FUCK FUCK FUCK and FUCK!
