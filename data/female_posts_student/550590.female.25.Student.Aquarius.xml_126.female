Despite Avi's (and more recently my boss') statements that I'm going to be 35 tomorrow, I'm actually only turning 24.  I just feel 35.  I'm having my midlife crisis a few years early...resisting the temptation to dye my hair pink and dress like a hotter, more classy version of Kelly Osborne.  I finished my UCF app last night and sent it off.  Now I just have to get one final reference and pray they give me lots and lots of money (and maybe let me teach a class or two.)  Sheesh I'm turning into my mother.  Somebody send me porn and a one way ticket to Europe, quick.
