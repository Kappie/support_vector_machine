Marissa really isn't smart, she's all mouth and no mind, and that's a huge problem. She has parrot syndrome, she repeats everything she says without thinking about its effects.   I just need to finish out my little thought processes about this whole deal and figure out what needs to be said. This doesn't need to go on any more, in any way.  I'm not studying tonight; I don't really care. How interesting, I used to be the little geek kid who would be spending his night studying; now I'm worrying about "social situations". Wish me luck Monday, by the way.  "Uh hello parents of Little Chin....Rosie Jiang, this is the police, calling to ask about Ms. Jiang about her involvement in crimes committed the first of May 2003 which, we think, she might have borne witness to, may I speak with her?...thank you....Hello, Ms. Jiang?.....HEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYY ROSIE HAVIN' FUN STUDYING HAHAHAAHAHHAA YOU THOUGHT I WOULDN'T CALL BUT I DID AND YOUR PARENTS FELL FOR IT WHAT A GREAT NIGHT IT'S GOING TO......."  "Hello? Hello?"
