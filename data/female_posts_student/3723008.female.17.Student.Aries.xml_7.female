So today,  besides the little cinema lime, was one of the not-nicest days of my life. Why? Fecking ITALY got KICKED OUT... thats why.. Man, I don't remember if i ever cried for a football match before this Euro Cup... but I cried today.. and well i had tears in my eyes when sweden scored the goal against Italy that day.. hummm... oh well, i'll live.. i hope.. the cinema lime was cool, i saw people that i haven't seen in about a month or two... give or take a few weeks... nandi.. clay... shameer.. pete... everybody! was nice... and of course i got to see daniel radcliffe... and well the olsen twins, new york minute sucked, btw, i wont recommend it to anyone. there's just 2 hotttt dudes in it, as all olsen movies have. okay, i still thinking about italy...   this is NOT good.. not too sure what my plans are for tomorrow, most likely i'd go by auntie molly, play with andy... OMG.. andy started to walk.. and its the cutest thing.. he doesnt walk.. he waddles actually.. its soooooooooooooooooo sweet... and then he falls on his little bum and giggles... n u see his 4 little teeth.. when i have a son, i want my son to be just like him.. i've never heard him cry... and i'm at my aunt's a lot, just not recently cuz of exams.. he doesnt give trouble.. he's the perfect little baby... my andy..:).. Im still working on my mom ... to let me go to Bravo Bravo some night... dont remember exactly when.. to see rene n them play... exams are over.. i feel like a bum with no purpose... haha.. I should really be sleeping right about now, but I think that I'm becoming an Insomniac... (just like my kevvy!!) Okay, will add more later today... byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...     Veni, Vidi, Vici... I came, I saw, I conquered...
