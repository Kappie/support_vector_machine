(Have I mentioned this already?)  urlLink http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/get_involved_fairtrade_fortnight_2004.htm  I'm gonna go help out in the co-op promoting fair trade stuff. I'll use my new found mafia techniques to convinse people to buy it. Or I'll drug the coffee. Warning. You don't want to meet me there. I'm gonna be on a mountanous moral high ground. And hell I'm gonna have a cape and a spandex outfit.
