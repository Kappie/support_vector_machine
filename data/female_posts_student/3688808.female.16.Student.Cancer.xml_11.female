Even though we have never met eachother in person, we were still close and I counted him as a friend none-the-less.    Recently Paul has become quite cocky and seems to have transformed into a raging arse-hole. Today Paul invited me to start sending webcam. I accepted and the webcam displayed me and my boyfriend sitting at the computer. To cut a long-story short, Paul was particularly nasty and sarcastic towards my boyfriend and I, and at one point referred to my boyfriend as a "nigger".   At first I was in shock fom what he had said. But later, I decided to confront him about his dickhead-ness. This is how it went....       Lèna:     my god Paul fellows you really have become an annoying, petty, racist little fucker haven't you?    Paul:     Hmmmm     Paul:      not wot I was expecting...wuda preferred a hello Lèna:  I'm not amused. Using sarcasm as a way to defend yourself is pretty fucking pathetic.    Paul:     wow    Paul:     k    Paul:     there was a time when u cud take a joke, evidently that time has passed Lèna:  Trust me, I can take a joke. I didn't want to say anything in front of my boyfriend, which is why I didn't bring this up earlier. But what you said was pretty fucking nasty     Lèna:     and bang out of order    Paul:     :/ everyone else can handle it coz they know I aint racist    Lèna:     that's a fucking contradiction if ever I've heard one...    Paul:     Jesus mother fucking Christ get off Ur hig horse woman. it was a comment that was not meant to be taken seriously, everyone else realises it except u. ur problem. Deal wivi t.    Paul:     *high    Lèna:     No Paul, everyone else doesn't realise it. You pretty much fucked off everyone in the room I was sitting in when you made that comment. I ain't on a high horse; I'm just not a racist self-righteous prick such as yourself. I don't know exactly WHAT issue you have with me, but I suggest you sort it out and get the fuck over it. During our previous conversation every word you typed was dripping with sarcasm, you picked fault with almost everything I either said or did. You USED to be an all right lad.... and I emphasise *USED TO BE* But lately you seem to have transformed into nothing less than a complete twat.    Paul:     lol ok    Lèna:     wow, what a response. Jesus mother fucking Christ Paul, you really know how to defend yourself don't you? You REALLY know how to back up what you say with a dignified reason! I'm stuck for words now, you've really gob smacked me with such a witty response. Grow the fuck up Paul, stop being such a fucking knob and get your act together. Because one day you're going to piss off the wrong person, it's inevitable, especially for a racist homophobic fucker like you    Paul:     I actually am quite amazed..this is quite an assualt ur making. the reason i aint defending myself is coz i aint really bothered. i wud defend myself against u if i actually gave a fuck    Lèna:     that's your problem isn't it sweetheart, you don't give a fuck about anyone but yourself    Paul:     there r many ppl that i give a fuck about..however u arent really one of them    Lèna:     oh, I presume that was your half assed attempt at an insult?    Paul:     no    Paul:     simply a statement    Paul:     if I wanted to waste my time insulting someone ill neva meet then i wud, however i fail to see the point    Lèna:     Isn't that what you were doing earlier? Insulting two people you've never met and will never meet?    Paul:     woteva u said i probably missed it due to msn failure    Lèna:     Then for your own benefit, I'll repeat myself    Lèna:     Isn't that what you were doing earlier? Insulting two people you've never met and will never meet?    Paul:     I don’t really remember much about before..i remember hats and thats about it    Lèna:     Why do I get the feeling that you're avoiding answering my question because you know that you can't?    Paul:     I don’t know, why r u getting that feeling?    Lèna:     Aww look, Paul is once again using sarcasm as a defence mechanism    Paul:     ok     Lèna:     I know for a fact you can remember that conversation, I KNOW that you can't answer my question. And YOU know (and if you don't, you should) that a 19-year-old MAN who cannot defend himself against a 16-year-old GIRL is pretty fucking weak.     Lèna:    don't you agree?    Paul:     I haven’t been bothering to "defend" myself against u    Paul:     if u said summat that bothered me, i might be tempted    Lèna:     To be honest Paul, you're bound to say that aren't you? You can't put up a decent argument and therefore use the *can't be bothered* card. You're making out that you have better things to do, well it's quite fucking low that you didn't have better things to do earlier than insult me and my boyfriend. Now that you've been confronted you're basically being a pussy and backing out PRETENDING you have better things to do than defending yourself and the things you say. Anyone can insult someone, but insulting someone and then being too much of a PUSSY to stand up for what you said is absolutely fucking PATHETIC    Paul:     where did i say i have better things to do then?    Paul:     I simply said i cudnt be bothered. whether u choose to believe that is entirelly ur choice and something i dont really care about. ur making this a big deal not me, u care about it not me    Lèna:     Hopefully this *Tina* will realise what a fucking dick you really are and will therefore save herself a lifetime of fucking misery and finish you. That is...if *Tina* actually exists, because let's face it, you're not exactly a chick magnet are you darlin?    Paul:     nice ploy there, trying to get a rise out of me..almost succeeded so dont stop trying    Lèna:     oh what a shame, because I'd hate for you to actually use up all of your precious energy creating a decent argument. To be honest, that shows how much you *love* this so-called *Tina*. And I don't know if it was just me but I don't actually recall you denying her non-existence    Lèna:     I hope for her sake that she is imaginary    Paul:     believe she is imaginary if u want..makes little difference to me    Paul:     I don’t need to have ur belief or disbelief..either way i care little    Lèna:     Well darlin', if she's real...give her my sympathy! Because it sounds like she fucking needs it.    Paul:     will do    Paul:     ill give her the sympathy of someone she will neva meet and/or give a fuck about    Lèna:     I'd appreciate that...thank you    Paul:     no problem
