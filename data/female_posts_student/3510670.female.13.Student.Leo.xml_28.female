Later i'm ganna go to school, kasi favor sakin un ng bestfriend ko..makaka-hindi pa ba me?! Love ko un eh! Di ko kasi sya nakita nung i went to school last tuesday.. Anyway, have you watch the episode of raw?! It was awsome! I totally love the "Steel cage match" of Y2J  Christian.. Christian was a total jerk! As well as Tomco  Trish Stratus! But on the other side, Edge didnt won the Intercontinental Champion from Randy Orton.. Im ganna wait for smackdown!!
