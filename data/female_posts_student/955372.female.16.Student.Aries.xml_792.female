After we took the drop ceiling down all these holes in my walls were exposed. Recently I have discovered that silverfish slither at will in and out of these holes. They make this clicking noise against the insalation (sp?) when they crawl around. So I can hear them when they come out. It's the most annoying thing in the world. A few nights ago I had a spaz attack and duck taped all the holes up that are near my bed. i.e. an entire corner. And yet they CONTINUE to crawl around the wall directly next to my bed. I keep a shoe next to my bed.
