This morning, from about 8:00 - 10:00 i guess, I was sooooo bored, so I decided to clean up my whole house, the living room, the kitchen [all the candy and stuff], and my room. Well it looks nice lol I guess but yea. Then after that, I went upstairs and I took a shower. I like warm showers, I despise cold ones. I remember when I went to the Philipines [i spell it wrong all the time] It was sooo hot and all the showers I took were cold ones. Bah!! I really wish it was sunny today. Well since its only like 11:54 a.m., hopefully later in the day it will be sunny. I checked the forecast, today is going to be a mix of sun and cloud and the high for today it 19 degrees. Right now, I'm eating a pogo! yummy. =P .I think somewhere in August I'm going to go to Canmore. Awww, I wish we'd go to Banff because there are so many skateboard shops there.  STUPID WEATHER!!!
