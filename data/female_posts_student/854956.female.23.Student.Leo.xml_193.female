That's gonna suck!  BUT, it's FRIDAY!  YAAAAAAAAY!  This means that I have a weekend in front of me, not to mention some daquiris and wine coolers ahead of me tonight!  And maybe some funnel cake... I dunno... We'll see!  And my uncle should be there, so I'll get to see him, too... making balloon animals... haha.  Ricky, remember when he made you that hat?  hahaha  That was funny.  Remember when we put all those chairs around a sleeping Jamey, and she woke up and totally freaked out...?  haha  Good times, good times.  Anyhow, I'm off to the shower and then to school/work...
