I'm sure I'll survive. It's summer, I'll catch up on my sleep eventually. Speaking of which, I'm going to be pulling an all-nighter again sometime next week because of my Ocarina of Time Campaign, as I have chosen to dub it. So far I've gotten Talley and Ross to agree to help me. Talley's free to bring Lairen, the more the better. I asked Jared, but he'll have to "see how he's feeling" next week when we decide to do it. I may have asked Trevor, but I can't really remember. So Trevor, if I haven't asked you yet, feel free to join us. I'd invite Scott, but he told me he hated me today so I think I'll just not do that. Then I could invite Sarah Williams, but I don't know if she'll contribute as much as I'd like. Either way, I've already recruited Rachel to be in charge of refreshments and all the random things we need. I guess she's kind of the go-pher. I'm really hoping this works out well. I have to talk to everyone and figure out what day would be the most opportune to take on the task, and I still have to ask my mother when it's OK. Hopefully I'll be able to pick a day in which my father's out of town allowing my companions and me to play downstairs in the living room. Well, wish me luck on my endeavor.
