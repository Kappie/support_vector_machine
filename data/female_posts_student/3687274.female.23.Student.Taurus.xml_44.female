I've only had half a cigarette and I've been awake for a good hour now.   TAMMY!!!!!!  DID YOU CHECK MY EMAIL AND DELETE MY DRUNK DIALING POST.  IF YOU DIDN'T YOU SHOULD HAVE.   Nikol I think you're right.  I think he's like me.   I also think I'm still a little um... not sober.   But I'm going to attempt to do more than smile next time I talk to him, I do anyway, but I feel like a kid or something most of the time.   Yeah, still a little um...  I don't think it's good to be awake when you're sobering up.  The sleep monster comes for me in the form of a blink.  I know, I can feel it.   People keep coming into my field of vision.  I wonder if I still have drool on the side of my face.  I wonder what my hair is doing.  I wonder if that's why people are looking away from me when they walk in.  I wonder if I smell of alcohol as much as I think I do.  I can't wait til my break.  I'm taking a nap.  Naps are good.  Mmm, nap.  I wonder if this coffee will help. Have you ever had that feeling, when you're some place you'd rather not be and then you start to focus on the day being over and suddenly it is.  Neither have I, but that's what I'm going for.   Wow, there was just a weirdness in my tummy.  Oh now I think today might be ending a little sooner than I planned.
