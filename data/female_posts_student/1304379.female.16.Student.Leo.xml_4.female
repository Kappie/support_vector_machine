I've not regretted dropping to sub sci man! Owell, like i have a choice. Hahaha!  There's the dreaded EMaths and Geography p2 tomorrow. I'm gonna do well for my EMaths. =D Failing maths is not my innate ability.   "I know i can, be what i wanna be, if i work hard at i, i'll be what i wanna be.."  Hahaha! Uh. Don't really like this song, but yea, it's appropriate here.  I realised i need to do well in a subject to like the subject, so i guess if i get 60 and above [which is bloody good considering my standards] for my EMaths, i'll be flying fucking over the moon man! HAHAH! I can't wait.  As for geography, it just comes to you when you write ya? [for human geog at least]  Anyway,  urlLink Horny  wants me to link her. And this is the best i can do until i get a new blogskin, which would be century egg years later coz i love this skin with a "heavenly-touch". Haha! Okay. Here's a quote worthy quote from Peychee which kept me laughing all night.  "Even though I got horny face, but i'm not horny one!"
