It's just more of a nuisance than anything. I guess we'd all just thought it had gone away. I was severely anemic as a baby, but I went to the hospital, they gave me shots, and I was ok.  I guess my lack of energy has started to worry my mom lately. And when I mentioned always being cold to her last night she said I might be anemic again. Oh well, it's ok, I just don't want to go get any more shots. I'm not a big fan. That AND the blood test I have to take AND the MRI. Blah. I'm scared enough of the hospital and doctor as is.   Alright, I think I'll stop complaining now. This all really isn't a big deal. I just needed to complain a little.
