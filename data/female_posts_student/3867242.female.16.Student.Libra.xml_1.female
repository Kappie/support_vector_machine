To make manners worse, I woke up around 7:30 this morningbecause my jerky brother just had to pick a fight with my sister...grr. I went to work today..I was supposed to work from 12-7:45 but I went home at 3..because we didn't get a lot of business today in good old concession. I took a nap again today, and had some terrible dreams that I don't want to share with anyone. Plus, I miss my mom!! My mom always goes on business trips for work. She's been in Chicago since Monday..and won't be back till' Friday. I've been used to my mom traveling a lot since I was little..but I miss her!! There's another why I'm sad..but I don't want to share what is it on here..just pray that I feel happy really soon. I will on this weekend when my mom is home and I go to Kennywood :). So yeah..I would write more..but again I'm not in the best mood..sorry.
