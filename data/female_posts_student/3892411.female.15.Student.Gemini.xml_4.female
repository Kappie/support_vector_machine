Yay!! they have several mini-bars and more and it's all free!! yay!  [TIP 2.] Don't forget to take all things given to you by the hotel 'with their compliments' as you are probably aying for them some other way even if you dont take them! Take things like tea bags, chocolate sashees, jam etc. on a daily basis as they will be replenished but otherwise jst get what you can when ou can!  [TIP 3.] Remember to smile and greet all the nice folks u meet, even if they're mean and nasty lookin, an nice smile and a polite "mornin!" never go a miss :-D
