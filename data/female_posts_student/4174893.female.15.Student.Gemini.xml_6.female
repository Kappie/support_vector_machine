Sarcasm is the protest of people who are weak.     maybe i do..i don't know. and if i do, what am i supposed to do about it?   after all the bitchy things i've said about the poor boy, how could i ever tell him face to face or on the phone that maybe the feelings i thought i have aren't really the ones i feel at all?   how can i tell him that maybe i started to fall in love when all of a sudden i was shut out?       even if i miraculously managed to tell him all that, would there really be a point?  how do i know he wouldn't just turn around and leave me again? well it   wouldn't really surprise me   if he did that; i deserve nothing more than    rejection.          why can't i just be the person i want to be? why does everything have to hurt so much?
