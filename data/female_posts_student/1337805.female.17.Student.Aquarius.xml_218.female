Of course now, Mom's trying to fuck it up and make me go straight to Edmonton with near-complete strangers....by myself. uhhh..NO. Just because she doesn't want me missing "a week" of school. And really, its just two. Cause I'll be going at least most of the 19, and they'll force me to go on the 25, just cause I came home in the afternoon the day before >  In addition to my arranging of travel, I saved all my blogs on hard copy, on my computer. Took a good couple of hours, still need to complete Jan 2004-now. But whatever.  I have tonsilitis again. Huzzah. But my meds are working deliciously. I love it. I went to Nick's thursday night, and spent pretty much the rest of the day with him. We danced :P And watched some movies, and of course, made out. It was gorgy :). Friday went to the doc's and got diagnosed. (Dr du Toit's such an awesome guy :) ). Then did all this boring junk on the comp. Then went to Steve's for his party. Kim, Jeena, Misha, Tom, Nick, Matt, Nana, Lauren, Stevey, and I were all there. It was an awesome blast, except for when everyone bought food to eat, and I couldn't eat anything cause of my throat. And when Nick and Ben ran off to go smoke, even though Nick said he wouldnt..>  Babysat Ayla all today, was feeling reaaaaally crummy and gross in the morning, until about lunch time. Made myself something SO delicious...Ichiban noodles, chicken flavored, and I added some dill and chicken lunch meat.. OMG it was so good, and I felt sooo much better after eating it too. We painted shelves, mine was really pretty, and Nick called so we talked to him for a bit :) Lots of fun. Ayla also now has his phone number, and I'm fearing the worst. Got lots of money though, now I want to go to Walmart and get that pair of pants and maybe that shirt I was oogling...need...new...things...  Alright, I'm out now. Didn't sleep very well last night and had to get up early...And I've got to get up and trudge to youth tomorw morning as well. I'm going in my jammies tho. Chat with y'all later.
