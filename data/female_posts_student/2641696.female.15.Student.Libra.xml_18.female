I got Level 8, the Maleborge (or something like that). For malicious, fraudulent people and panderers ... don't ask what a panderer is, I don't know either. Go check A's for more details. lol.   2. I took the personality disorder test, and, not surprisingly...        Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    High       urlLink Schizoid :    Low       urlLink Schizotypal :    Moderate       urlLink Antisocial :    Low       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    High       urlLink Narcissistic :    High       urlLink Avoidant :    Moderate       urlLink Dependent :    Low       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    Low       --  urlLink take the test  --       I wasn't too surprised. Paranoid, hell yeah. Narcissistic... even more so. Histrionic (like the narcisism)... I could have guessed that one too.   I was surprised this one wasn't higher, considering what I'm like... lol.    Schizotypal  Many believe that schizotypal personality disorder represents mild schizophrenia. The disorder is characterized by odd forms of thinking and perceiving, and individuals with this disorder often seek isolation from others. They sometimes believe to have extra sensory ability or that unrelated events relate to them in some important way. They generally engage in eccentric behavior and have difficulty concentrating for long periods of time. Their speech is often over elaborate and difficult to follow.   Yes? No? Iunno, just when I read that I was like - hey! That's me! :p But whatevah.   And Justice kid, who are ya? loll.
