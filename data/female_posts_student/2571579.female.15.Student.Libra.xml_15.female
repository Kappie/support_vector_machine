The whole day we sat in the pavillion..then we ordered pizza and played Bullshit haha When i got home i talked to Carolyn and we went for a run.. about 3 miles and it was raining a little so it was nice cause i like running in the rain. We talked the whole time about Prep tho and i had a cramp and we were going slower then I usually do but that's ok. I enjoyed the company.
