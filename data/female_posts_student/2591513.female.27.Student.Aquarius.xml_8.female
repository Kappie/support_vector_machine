I had BIG plans for my birthday, only because I wanted to get away, but I don't think that is going to happen.  Oh well.  I guess there are more important things to life, right?  Well, I have been depressed the past couple of days, hence the short blogs.  I guess you can say everything was setting in.  The loss of the baby, the physical and emotional hardness of it.  Then Ed finds out a military buddy, someone he admired killed himself.  I cannot judge him because of his previous actions that put him in jail because we don't know what private hell he was in.  I cannot imagine the experience of war, what was seen, what was heard and how it can alter a person's mind.  The man I did know loved his career and his family more than most men I know.  So it is hard to swallow that he would give them up without a fight.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife and beautiful daughter.  I also pray that his sould will rest in peace.  Then we also hear that my Uncle Mike's mother passed away.  All these deaths...just doens't seem right to be happening so early in the year.  What a sad way to start the year.  I think with the bleeding slowing down, my body is starting to adjust.  Thank goodness.  Well I hope you are all enjoying your day...the 3 of you who read this...haha
