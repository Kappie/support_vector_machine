It's like I'm the only writer in the world who has no skill for talking crap to strangers for no reason.  With any luck this one will take off.  Probably because I decided today that I'm never going outside again.  Here's the thing.  I love summer, more than almost anything (cigarettes and Pepsi are the two immediate contenders).  I love wearing shorts and tank tops and going swimming and sweating my ass off and not being able to fall asleep because I can't bear to have a blanket touch me and I can't fall asleep without a blanket.  And it infuriates me that it's just not summer here.  I had to wear a sweater today.  A sweater!  It's the middle of freaking July!  Well, as far as the weather goes, New Jersey 1, Wales NIL!*    (* nil : the British equivalent to zero in score-keeping.  ex. "How's the football going?" "Well, it's nil-nil, but it should get exciting in the extra time.")
