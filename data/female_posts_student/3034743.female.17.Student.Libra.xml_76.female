He touched Alex's leg...hehe. After that I did nothing really. Then around 6, Alex stopped by for about a half hour. We talked about some stuff, and shared some weird laughs.  As I'm blogging right now, I am talking to Alex and we are gonna watch a movie together. I'm gonna go to her house now...so I'll blog tomorrow maybe.
