Sucks I don't see you more often to actually, I don't know, speak.  ;)  *whoosh*  ;)  Anyway, physics does indeed suck, but hopefully it will be my last science.    Talk to you guys soon.  Oh, Hi, Scott!  Thanks for reminding these guys of my address.  I appreciate it.  Good job!  As for Michael, I don't give a damn.  People with that name are not scoring well in my book as of late, if you catch my drift.  ~Z
