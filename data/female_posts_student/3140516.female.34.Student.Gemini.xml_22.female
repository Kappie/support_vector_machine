I joined a group online that promotes friendship, etc. okay. I posted very clearly I am looking for friends, nothing more at this point in time, because although having a g/f would be nice, it is not the most important thing in the world, 'k? I sent out a bunch of comments to various people, ones who said that they wanted to make friends, didn't matter with who. There was one girl in particular whose profile I liked, and who seemed to have a lot of the same interests as me. She sent a response that I am not allowed to be her friend, because she only allows blonds on her friends list, like herself. But that she would be more than happy to chat and definitely cyber with me. WTF????? How fucking shallow is that? "Oh you can't be a friend of mine, but I will fuck you and talk to you when no one else is around." Fucking cunt. Like I would cyber with her in the first place.       Anyway....still doing the calculating the cash thing. Trying to get enough money saved for the move, etc.Hoping I get my 338.00 pretty fucking soon, or things are gonna be a little tight.
