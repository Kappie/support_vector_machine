The project is essentially done, and I have been approached by my advisor as to whether I want to submit it for publication.  This worries me, in part, because she presented a poster of my work with her name listed as first author last Spring.  At a fairly important conference. Now, with this publishing thing...she said she has made an attempt to fix some of the problems with the paper.  Does that mean she expects first author privileges again?  I'm at a loss of what to do.  I would love to have a paper published as an undergraduate, but it is MY work.  She helped out, as my advisor.  I have trouble standing up to the professors I work so closely with because of that very fact.  I have to work closely with them.  Plus some of them do have quite the large ego. So now Im excited but stressed that she is trying to take credit for my work again.  I don't know what to do.
