I've kept myself very busy and now I'm outta gas. Man, I need friends who drive besides me! Lol. But it's cool... yeah.  Today was a most excellent day at the beach: me, Charlotte, Nick, Josh, and Jesse at Newcastle Beach wooo! Yesterday was also very cool, I got a new outfit at Nordstroms while I was there turning in an application (!!), and I had a job interview for (buh buhbuh BUH!) SAM GOODY! It went really well and I hope SOOOOOO much that I get that job, all you guys know it's like my DREAM JOB (ok highschool job lol) to work in a record store! Babababa I hope I get it I hope I hope.  Also, on Friday Charlotte slept over and we continued our fabulous scrapbook with all the pictures from my BBQ and pictures from a camera I dug up and developed from last summer. It's so outstanding, yaaay we rock. Oh lol today we got MORE pictures back and now (OH NO) the scrapbook won't be in chronological order cause they're from last summer! Oh wells. They're really cute! Glad I had fun today because for the next four days I have a 6 hour figure drawing class, that's alot o naked. I'll probably be the youngest one there because I signed up for the adult class.... Hopefully I won't be the worst too. Lol. I'm just sick of being put in with the 13-14 year olds who are just like "Drawing is fun! Haha naked, that sounds funny!", like last time. Wish me luck not getting lost in Seattle tomorrow...!  Gaaa Ryan come home dammit! It's Independence Day soon. I'm tired. I need to finish ma art.  I'm hungry! How did that happen?
