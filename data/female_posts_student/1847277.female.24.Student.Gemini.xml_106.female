And I'm excited because the top scholar for Middle Paleolithic lithic analysis will be there.  So I can finally learn lithics, well, on a basic level, at least, since he and I will only overlap for a couple weeks.  Which means I can prepare to be lonely/isolated the first couple weeks, as usual. It'll give me time to work on my Serbian, at least.
