Whatever, all that matters is that I'm not in fifth period right now.  And the crowd goes wild!  *mediocre applause*  I've knocked off whole two chapters of The Two Towers this morning.  I feel a sense of accomplishment washing over me... yes, I bathed this morning.  Since I'm still a tad ill, I've been decreed to lie around the house doing as little as possible, to regain my strength.  That's all well and good, but I kinda want to go shopping.  Not like shop-til-I-drop-or-similar, but just bee-bop over to Pamida to buy my Skating Sister a present for next week's competition and etc.    I'm really very funny, don'tchaknow.  I got out of bed today @ 7:30am when I could've slept til... now.  I took a nice little nap earlier this morning, though.  I had a very interesting 'dream,' although I think I was still awake... do you count that as a dream, then?  A lucid dream?  Anywho, I enjoyed it... then I snapped back into reality, kicked myself swiftly in the rear a few times and then kept reading my book.  The Real World and I don't get along too well.  I smote him like a mofo, Manda
