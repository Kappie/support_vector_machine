We were so close Shared all of our secrets and dreams, Trusted each other entirely, Our friendship just so strong     Now you’re gone but, the spirit of yourself, Still lingers here It’s stopping me from surviving though, The memory of you is still very much alive, Gloating me and haunting me Tugging at the essence of myself    Never have I felt, So much sorrowfulness and despair There are a million things, I should have said... We may never meet again So all of those words and there meanings, Are lost forever    You died and, I am still living but, Can I live on without you? Fill the empty whole in my heart or Am I lost forever in? Nothingness and loneliness Afraid to love again.
