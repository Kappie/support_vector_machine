Most of the people I met were pretty sketchy but it was still awesome.  The bad mood is induced by a lot of things:  The first thing said to me as I walk through the door after getting a grand total of 10 hours of sleep is "Elena I need you to mow the lawn," my dad is lying on the couch watching some show on the discovery and he needs me to mow the lawn, then the psychotic sibling came home, the psychotic sibling who is currently crying and cursing at me because I shot down her plans for her and her friend to tag along on MY beach trip.  In addition to this G-d awful, totally stupid unauthorized plan my mother told her that Derick can spend the night Monday night and we will drop him off at home somehow on the way to the beach! How the hell is Garner anywhere near the beach and how the hell do we plan to make this whole thing work.  My mom totally doesn't get the group thing and it's pissing me off.  Finally the last thing that ruined my day is our summer vacation.  She fucking planned it to start the Sunday after school gets out! I had called that week to spend with all of y'all before I go away to camp for who knows how long.  So instead of seeing my friends I'll get to spend time with psycho and the parents.  We'll get home sometime mid Saturday and I will leave for Kanata Sunday morning at 8.  Sounds as much fun as a barrel of monkeys...I HATE MY FAMILY right now
