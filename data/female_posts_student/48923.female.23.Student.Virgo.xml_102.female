(slightly amazing in the fact that she didn't get booted from school,  unlike other extended family members, and she managed to be an academic show-off despite genes for academic laziness.)  but in one of those unexpected moves, my dad decided to overcompensate for the loss of his daughter to the collegiate machine with a dog.  a dog in a historically cat-friendly household.  when i was 4 my family had a brief stint in dog ownership.  i seem to only remember pieces stiched together from photo albums, that frodo (the dog) had floppy ears and vaguely resembled a doggie pull-toy, i briefly enjoyed before i moved onto the bouncing horsey.  frodo did something really bad (maybe attach my baby brother?) and i was told he would be happier playing at our family's farm....    i grew up loving cats, for their happy human ambivalence and their safe stature.  --at this point i'm being attacked by family cat cuteness.  yessss you're the cutest kitty in the world. -- where ever my train of thought was going, it has been temporarly derailed.  oh yes, cats are cute, independent, cute, and cute.   whereas dogs (in my experience) have been cute from a distance, but evil yappy creatures who will attack without provocation, and require humans.  i guess my dad has grown accustomed to the low maintence levels of cats... a little food, little water, a few shakes of the litter box, and a few affirmations of their cuteness and they're happy campers.   but he got a  dog.    a small dog possessed by demons....
