So what have I done for the past couple of days? Saturday was Spring Sing at Oklahoma Christian U. Josh D. had bought me a ticket with his family, so I went with them in the late afternoon. But I drove myself so I could stay over at Delisa’s apartment. The show was great, and afterwards we went to Santa Fe Steakhouse with about 25 people (Josh’s family, Joe’s family, me, Ray, Janna Kay, Jeremy, Heath, Talsie, Mandi, and Josh and Joe of course). Ray got the crab legs and I tasted a little. I just got chicken and green beans – nothing too exotic.  When I drove back to the campus, Delisa’s roommate told me that there were going to be about three girls sleeping over, so I got myself a Jamba Juice and just went over to Josh’s house to stay the night over there. I such a miss priss when I sleep. I need a bed, darkness, the cold, and the hum of my portable fan (which I had put in my trunk). Josh and I watched a little of Penny Serenade (I love old movies. Love love love) until Heath called and told us to get over to the campus. We were all pretty tired, so we decided not to do the abandoned-houses-in-Guthrie-tresspassings but listened to music and played mafia with Heath’s roommates and their friends that were hanging out in the apartment. Then, we played a little Settlers of Catan at Ross’s, and Josh and I drove home. Then I was a heathen.  See, Josh’s dad is a preacher at a conservative Church of Christ church in Moore. Anyway, I knew that we would end up getting back pretty late on Sat. night and I really like to sleep. I told Josh that I would probably sleep in on Sunday morning, which he didn’t think that his parents would like at all. But Josh’s parents are desperately nice to me, so they said that they didn’t care. The next morning, I woke up to the sun, and took my shower in the very empty house. I got dressed and went downstairs. There weren’t any poptarts in the whole kitchen. I was baffled as to what to do for breakfast, so I ate a banana. Then I just took my leftover chicken from the night before and got the KC Masterpiece sauce out and ate that while reading a little of Milton’s Paradise Lost. After licking the barbecue sauce off each finger, I put the dishes away and then went out to the sunlit, breezy backyard to finish reading until they all got home. Then Josh played basketball with me while his dad started the grill and we ate lunch a little later. Well, we went to the lake after that (Ray, Heath, Josh, me, and Janna Kay) and it was so beautiful. I know it was a lake in Oklahoma, but all that water with the sunlight glinting off creating some blue-white symphony of foam and breeze makes me deliriously happy. We skipped stones off the water and walked to the lighthouse. We tossed around the football, just lay in the sand, and Janna captured it all on her video camera. We stayed for a few hours until the sun set, and then Janna had to go back to campus to get ready for rehearsal. The guys went to the grocery store while Janna and I went back to her apartment to start dinner. We watched That 70s Show and cooked and told Janna that we would bring all of the food to her in Judd theatre when it was ready, which we did. We ended up eating picnic-style on the floor on the conservatory outside of Judd. Then, back at her apartment, we watched Cold Creek Manor and I helped Janna make a chocolate cake with Butter Cream icing and sprinkles. Oh, but here’s why I’m a heathen: see, Josh missed Sunday night church since we were playing at the lake and later on his dad called him to sort of give him a guilt trip about it. Now I’m so sleepy. Even though I don’t have a job yet at school tomorrow, I’m going to wake up at 6:30 a.m. to hope that they call. I’m already working at Edward Jones from 1 to 5:30, but I could work for half a day at a school. I need somewhere to work on the weekends. I think I’ll look over Spring Break, since I’ll be free. sorry, this was such a boring post.
