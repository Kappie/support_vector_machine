With a whoping total of three guests we decided the fate of the "mystery couple" from the graduating class.  We decided it was going to be Giles and *sex voice* Ashely.  We also watched the senior video, although we skipped "The Dream Season."  Sadly enough.  It was a good time though, and we did get rid of some more reception food.  Strange I seemed to get enough of football during football season.  Oh wait let's bring it back one more time.  Oh Oh and once again.  And for old time's sake, one more time.  Sorry, I'm just so sick of football.     Today I went ot Great Spoons, a picked out alot of stuff to bring to the Ukraine, and found some clothes for when I'm job shadowing my aunt, and I'm feeling a little better about the trip, now that I'm that much closer to being ready.  But I'm still rather nervous.  I don't speak the language, because they speak Russian, now if it was Spanish I could communicate a little bit, at least enought to survive, but Russian, I'm screwed.  And right now I have a social life, and friends, and I like it alot.  I want to leave next september, when almost all my friends leave, that would be ideal.  Next september, I will have a whopping total of 3 friends.  And they're busy people, and I'll hardly see them.  Although if I can make the cut for Drama which is probably not very realistic, I'll spend alot more time with them in the spring.  But I want t spend time with my friends now.  But I know it will be a good experience, and I really do want to go to Europe, and I really should get out of this stupid town, aside from yearbook camp this summer, maybe.  And I do want to go, I'm just torn.    I am now debating whether I really want to be in tennis next year.  I mean I hate tennis, and I hate doing Geff's poop work.  (pardon my french) But I like being on the team with Leila, but then I suck, and Leila is good, and I won't ever see her next year.  I didn't even get to sit by her at Paradiso teusday this year.  I sat at the freshman table.  And I hate tennis, and I hated last year, but I want to be in the pepfest, and I know I'll be so jealous whenever anything tennis related is happening, even though if I was going I'd give anything to stay.  So how conflicted am I?  Very very very conlficted, so I'm not going to think about it right now, because I have to go in for yearbook tomorrow, and I need to get to bed.  Sorry this was a rant entry.  I hate when I complain like that.
