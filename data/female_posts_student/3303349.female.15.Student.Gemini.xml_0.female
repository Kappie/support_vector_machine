I have head what a fiasco it was but even though I was there, I didn't notice anything. Yeah anyway people are still convinced that I'm going out with Tony...hum I wonder why...There really isn't all that much to say...oh yeah Sarah got back from Arkansas today. I think I'm getting strep throught. Oh I'm in Nick's class for drivers ed! I have a friend! I won't be alone as I go throught that insane class. I get to drive...It's so gonna rock. I don't care what people say this is my chance for freedom from my family!! Will I have to go practice...I've kinda been slacking. Gotta make up for that...
