Opera and then punky-rock. And up after this and Perfect Government (another NoFX song) is Barbossa is Hungry (Klaus Badelt, from PoTC). And then He's A Pirate and Fog Bound, two more Klaus Badelt. And then Vesti La Guibba. From Pagliacci.  Yeah, I have a lot of different tastes. Fun stuff, it is.  I figured I should update my blog. I did a lot of template editing yesterday, and then gave up and put it back to the way it originally was, man. Cause I'm weird.   But anyway.   Just been thinking a lot about life and stuff lately.   Like, what's the purpose?   I'm sure every teen goes through this at one point.  But also, I think I'm going fucking insane. Like, I think too deeply about some things. I've been finding myself spelling words correctly and then looking at them and thinking they're incorrect, even ones that I've known since, like, first grade. I've always been a good speller. And now, it takes me two minutes to spell purpose. I was like... purpous *backspace backspace* purpus? No... *backspace backspace* And eventually I got purpose. Yay.  And musical pitches. I think I'm going nuts and having trouble, like, distinguishing between them.  Anyway.   I'm so fucking SICK of Michael Moore. Everybody's been praising him how good his movie is. I've only seen the previews and I can tell you this:  It's fucking edited and clipped to -only- show what he wants people to see. That's why I'm not going to see it. Or maybe I should, just to see how much bullshit it really is.  Grah. He pisses me off. I watch things like the Oscars to get away from stuff like politics. And he has to bring it up. If I wanted something fucking political, I'd go turn on CNN or something.   Damn you, Michael Moore. People wonder why I'm freaking nuts around political stuff.   NEWSFLASH: IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU, YOU DUMBASS, MOORE.  GOING//FUCKING CRAZY  Alias: Elle//fin.
