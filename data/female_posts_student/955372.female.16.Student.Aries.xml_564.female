She woke me up at like 7:30 to do that. I'm like "mother, do you not get the concept of sleeping in!" well actually it was more like *grunt* Yeah, so we walk in the door of the museum and the first thing we see is a giant crotch eye-level. It was like part of a big poster of a painting of some ballet guy. I'm like "i'll take that as a sign for the quality of the day that is ahead of me" yeah so we spent a thousand years there then came home, and went to go see gio's play. It was soooo cute. omg little people rock. It was the sound of music and there were all these like little nazis running around. Priceless.
