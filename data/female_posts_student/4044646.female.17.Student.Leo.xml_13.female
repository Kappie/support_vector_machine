But then I guess the thing thats been on my mind the most is something I should've gotten over a long time ago but I guess it was something I thought would be great and well turned into a pile of crap... everytime I see him now I think about kicking his ass and then slap some common sense into him.. I mean what is he thinking when he makes his decisions?? "Oh It's time to spin the bottle again"... that's how his mind works... doesnt care about much except how she looks.. yeah im sure it would be nice to have a skinny and petit body, but what of those who aren't blessed with that? Those I mean myself, its not that I dont wish to loose weight and gain more muscle mass... I would do anything to build that up, but Im not really complaining about how I look cause Im happy for the strengths that i've got now and whats to come with it.I dunno I guess im just in kind of a gloomy stage inside but then on the outside it doesnt seem to be as noticeable unless your some psychic and can see right through me...(weirdo) lol but yeah Im going to try to not let any of this get to me and effect me....   *Meh*.... lol
