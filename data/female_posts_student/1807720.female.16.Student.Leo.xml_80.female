I am still confused about chem but hopefully the teacher will be there tommorow and she can help me during tutorial.  When my mom got home from work (her other job doing demos for cat and dog food) she took matt and I out for dinner.  We went to Swiss Chalet and ate like tons and had dessert and everything.  It was so good but I made him promise me that he would stop me from eathing junk all week.  LOL.
