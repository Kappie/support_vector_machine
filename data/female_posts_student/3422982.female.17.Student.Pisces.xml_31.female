We swtiched off with our driving too, every other two hours.  I almost flipped the car according to him (and maybe I could have, I don't know) when I almost missed the street we had to turn on to get to Rachel's.  But hey, we were alive so all was good.  Rachel was alone when we got there, so we waited for Mick to get home and then we all went out for lunch.  After that we went back to the house cuz Mick was expecting friends and he gave us directions to a hotel, so that's what we did next.  Rachel took us to a hunting store and Dad bought a couple of bear figurines as gifts (one for a friend of his and one for Grandma).  Then we took Rachel home and Dad met Isaac and Denise. Friday: Rachel's old friend Rachel (...) had planned to take Rachel shopping and I guess said I could come, so I got to meet her and her mom Cricket (nickname).  Two extremely nice people.  We shopped with them for about two hours and then they left for a dentist appointment.  Dad took us out to lunch at a good BBQ place (Famous Dave's) and then we took Rachel home so she could help Denise set up for the party that night, although Denise was pretty much done when we got there.  They sent us out for ice cream... yeah... We had stopped back at the hotel first so I could change my shirt cuz it had gotten mud on it from one of the dogs and Dad ended up wanting to watch Jepaordy.  Then, I said we should go to K-mart for ice cream because then I could pick up a cd and book I wanted but that K-mart didn't sell ice cream so we headed over to Wal-mart.  Holy shit... white trash EVERYWHERE.  But what's new for Wal-mart?  So about two hours later we ended up back at the house with the ice cream, we had gotten it from the place Denise told us to get it in the first place, ha.  Dad was asked to cook the hambergers and hotdogs.  I think he wanted to because it kept him busy and he wasn't standing around feeling ackward.  I got to meet two of Rachel's uncles and their wives and kids.  I'm amazed I even remembered names.  The only names I don't remember are her aunts.  I spent the night with Rachel because Dad snores so damn loud it keeps me up.  I could here him in the hallway of the hotel it's that bad. Saturday: Denise drove Rachel, Dad and I to the county fair.  I'm sorry Rachel but that fair was really, really wimpy... It could fit into a Puyallup Fair parking lot.  But I got doughnuts so it was cool.  Then we went out for lunch.  Dad insists our waitor had the hots for me... whatever.  Denise went home and we picked up Mick and headed for the mall.  Got me some comics!!  Finished off another one of my series, so I'm happy.  I also got a book written by Penn from Penn and Teller (yeah the magician dudes from Vegas).  Appearently it's about a guy whose wife is killed or just dies and he befriends this gay guy and he ends up gay.  All this being told from a sock monkey's point of view.  After that Mick had us play Risk with him and just when everyone was starting to actually understand it and get into it, he had to leave to go see a movie.  So Dad took me and Rachel to grab dinner (Taco Bell) and we watched our shows.  We left after that. Today: We left the hotel at 6:30ish and got home at 2.  I drove for about an hour I think.  I was just way too tired because I practically never slept on this trip.  Soon as we got inside I went to Dad's room and slept 'till 5.  Sherri called me not too long ago asking if I was going to come to her house.  She wants me to so I said ok, but I don't think Dad wants me to go.  Sherri thinks it's because I'll be gone a week, but I don't know.  So I'm off to go get answers out of him before I call Mom... it's starting to get late over there so I gotta hurry. later dayz
