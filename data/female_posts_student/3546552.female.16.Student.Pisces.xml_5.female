I woke up this morning at 10 to go to my school and  unenroll  in the retarded French independent study I'm already in and  re-enroll  in a new one, which will make sooo much more sense! After that, I took my dog to get her hair cut and then went out to lunch with my mom. However, the real highlight of my day, was the fact that cell group was at Sarah Wier's house.  We had fun playing pool and ping pong as well as having deep conversations about boy girl relationships...lol, it was cool though. I missed you, there was no one to finish my sentences or understand my inside jokes. But I know you come back soon! Hope your safe and having lots of fun, making good memories...but not too many withought me!  Talk to you soon. ~kendra
