He sounds so cheerful: he starts out with a "Hi Lydia!" even though I've kept my own email to a conservative, unassuming level. For some reason, I think, wow. That is so awesome. I want to meet him. But that's very unrealistic. I imagine he's some preppy kid with tousled brown hair.  On a sadder note, I got 21 and 22 wrong, respectively, on my Princeton Review practice tests. That's basically a raw score of 54. Not too pleased, plus, I ran out of practice tests already, so either I go out and grab an REA or I try the library. Maybe. Barnes and Noble closes at 11, so I still have a chance. It's not looking good, though. Lit is annoying, and so is USAP now. What am I to do?
