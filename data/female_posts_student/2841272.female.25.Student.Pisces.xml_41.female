Throw in an animated movie and not only will they stay distracted for ninety minutes but also learn valuable lessons, like being true to yourself, finding the inner beauty, appreciating your home and family, etc.  No wonder Walt Disney is the world’s best babysitter.  In 2001  Shrek  broke that mold, and its very funny, very touching sequel has returned to break it again.   Shrek  was the kind of cartoon Disney used to make-one that appealed to adults as well as kids.  The scathing treatment the film gave Disney went over the kids’ heads, but the grown ups, myself included, lapped up every second.   Shrek 2  is every bit as layered as the original.  Our green hero is still as uncomfortable with himself as he is with the rest of the world and his newly ogred wife is still unsure about her new shape.  One of the themes I appreciated in the first film, which is picked up in the second, is how we can be both fiercely committed to ourselves while equally uncomfortable with who we are.   Shrek 2  is the exact opposite of the summer movies seen so far- it not only has something to say, but has a kick ass, jovial time expressing it.   Shrek 2  widens its scope past Disney to take a jab at Hollywood while exploring the difficulties of happily ever after.  The go for broke, kamikaze spirit that so illuminated the first is back, and turned up in the sequel.  The Fairy Godmothers even gayer limo driver has replaced Robin Hood’s Merry Men.  The film references are not only more frequent but less subtle, especially my favorite, the  Mission Impossible  spoof.  Even more than the original the creators really pushed the bounds of a PG rated cartoon, to hilarious results.   Shrek 2  is the second big leap forward in elevating animated voiceovers to the status it deserves.  Mike Meyer’s brogue and Cameron Diaz’s giggles have the tendency to wear thin in live action films (Meyers in the  Austin Powers  sequels especially), but under their animated veneers they infuse their characters with humanness rare in cartoons.  Eddie Murphy once again finds the perfect balance between hilarity and obnoxiousness that takes the stereotype out of the sidekick.  On the other hand Antonio Banderas, mocking his  Zorro  character, throws every cliché he has into his Puss in boots, and delivers his most nimble, charming performances in years.  Every performer brought a gleeful vim to their character but none more than Jennifer Saunders, whose delicious, campy villain capped off the film with a musical number mixing  Post Cards From the Edge  and  Footloose .  Now that’s creative!   Shrek 2  wasn’t as well put together as the first, at times it seemed almost too big for its creators to handle, but it was riskier and funnier.  Sequels are hard.  For a film to be successful it must come to a satisfying resolution, but sequels intrinsically undo that resolution.  A film that not only builds on its predecessor but also deepens the characters while avoiding repetition, now that’s an accomplishment.  Just like Fiona, I’ll take Shrek just as he is.
