Every day I struggle with the impatience and aggravation that we all feel when confronted by the crush of commuting humanity.  I try really hard to view myself as part of a larger organism, rather than a polarized "me. everyone else." perspective.  This is what leads to the "everyone is in MY way" feelings which are not good for anyone.  Anyhow, I really try hard with this, and think about it a lot, so it is very hard to watch people absolutely lose their shit on the subway or in the street.  It's hard for me to understand how people can already be so angry, so happy to pick a fight rather than just squash it.  Usually if you pick a fight you make yourself feel worse, in addition to everyone around you, who're just trying to get home peacefully.  It is the negativity, but also the indulgence that I really can't stand, in addition to the thoughtlessness.
