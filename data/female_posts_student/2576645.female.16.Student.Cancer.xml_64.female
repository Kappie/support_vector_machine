While I was bored last night, I went down stairs and started looking through all our old records, and I found Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits. My response?  "Hella cool!"  So I pulled out the vinyl, and guess what fell out. guess. guess. guess.  A Bob Dylan poster! My second response?  "Hella WOO!"  No just kidding, I didn't really say that. But all the same, I was SUPER pumped.   Its so vintage-y and 70s I just can't help but love it. I promptly hung it up in my room.  Also, I found Janis Joplin's Greatest Hits, Tommy, Simon and Garfunkel, and a whole lotta broadway records (my moms).  I just LOVE records.  I love 'em, I love 'em, I love 'em!!
