Then Amy and I went to the mall. We saw Brielle, Alexia, and Hayley there. Those girls are so crazy..they followed me around Aeropostal and I didnt even see them! Yea, im blind. Then it was onto Books-A-Million. Amy squilled like a little girl in there. She was so happy to find the book, umm...i dont even remember!! It was, needless to say, a kids book!! After the fun conversation there...oh yea it was a good one...we went to target where we picked up some stuff and amy yelled at my spanish student teacher who was half way across the store. WOW, good times good times. Then i started feeling icky again so we left.  Thats about it people. Tomorrow is SUNDAY!! Which is the best day of the week. I see all my cool friends, all 2 of them!! and go to the awesomest youth group in the world, OH YEA!! Life cant get much better..  well friends im out..  l8er sk8er boi's
