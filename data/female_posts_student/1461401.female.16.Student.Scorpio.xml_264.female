Friday afternoon I rode my bike over to alex's and stayed there till almost midnight. We went to The Grill around nine for a burgar and they were so good. Then we went to B2K and got some good icecream.  The ride home was really nice. Alex lent me a sweatshirt of his so I wouldn't be cold, and I've slept in it the past two nights. It's very warm, like a big hug. *teeheehee* Oh god I sound stupid. Oh well. Then yesterday we went to see Starsky and Hutch. It was awesome. Seriously, it was sweet. We also went to see the play, and it was actually a lot better than I was expecting. Today I'm probably gonna go over to alex's to watch a movie we bought yesterday that I am anxiously waiting to see. I also got...ummm... wow, totally just lost my train of though. Well, that means I need coffee, also means I'm gonna go drink coffee, also means I'm gonna stop writing now.     I LOVE YOU ALEX!  ~Kristin
