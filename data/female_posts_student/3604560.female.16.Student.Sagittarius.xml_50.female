Yay! It seems like perfect timing that they should repeat it just when we're doing the book in English.  Watched King Arthur today. The story is very different, no magic, nothing supernatural (ie. no lady in the lake with excalibur [sp?]) I can see a little of why people think Ioan is cute, but the beard was very off-putting (nothing like Aragorn, who looks really weird without a beard)  Well, that's it.
