No matter how good of a day I have, something always reminds me and it tears me down. They always haunt me. My insecurities about everything find a way to take control of me, until I lose complete control. I tried cutting tonight for the first time, obviously it didn't work because I'm here to type this the next day. The blade was too dull. I can still feel and see the red scratch marks burning. It feels good. Now I understand why cutters, well, cut. At the same time, I feel ashamed for even trying it. I feel like a hypocrite, for always judging those who cut because they couldn't take it... and now I try it. And worse- I like it.   I'm sick of feeling all this hate toward everyone. Why can't it just go away. I try every way possible to cut off contact with them because I don't want to say anything wrong to them, and then I actually tried to make things better by standing up for them, and I get cut down again. When will they realize how much it really hurts... they do know, they just don't care enough to change. Why should they change, anyway. They have the artificial highschool relationships who they can hold hands with and cuddle with in the halls. Then they have their best friends to gossip with, and have sleepover with so they can paint their nails and watch chick flicks and dye their hair pretty colors, or go get a fake orange-looking tan. Why do I even want to be apart of that?   Why don't I ever belong anywhere? Whenever I begin to feel better, the bitter taste of insecurity and lack of self confidence builds up again, as some kind of harsh reminder that I should never be happy. I hope they burn in hell for doing this to me.
