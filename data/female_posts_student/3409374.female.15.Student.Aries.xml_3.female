Haha...me and my frens walked all the way through the jungle but when we reached the road, something came over me and i started running to the finishing line all by myself..haha...adrenaline rush :) School nowadays is juz so slack man....when we came back, ppl were talking, sleeping, reading, discussing CIP etc....so xian. Why do they bother to keep us in school anyway? But after recess, we got this drum group to perform for us...all kinds of drums...cuban, latin, indian, etc...it was way cool when they all played together, even though they were all from different countries *harmonisation* haha... Every day is so xian...the three things i do are: play piano, play violin, go online. Even though it's xian at home, i also dun feel like going anywhere...i find it quite pointless too, walking along Orchard Road doing nothing...juz tiring my legs up...haha Anyway, supposed to see someone online today, but i guess school isn't over yet on the other side of the island :)
