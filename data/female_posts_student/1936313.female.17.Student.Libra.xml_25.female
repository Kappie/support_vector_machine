Be patient.. and please read it guys... and then offer help.. because I feel like I'm losing my mind...  Where to start though? Everything just simply... is... theres no beginning... nor any end in sight.  Let's start with the weather, hey? Its been rainy.... foreshadow anything? You bet. The melancholy has set in and I shall repeat for the million and oneth time.......  I fucking miss Michael.  Yet, I think I only miss him because he could make me laugh like nobody else... and he could tell the whole male population to stay the hell away from me without seeming possessive.... (Alright.. yea.. he was possessive..) and... I could talk to him, about anything, and he'd listen... and he always knew exactly what I needed to hear... even if it wasn't what I wanted to hear.  Why did he have to go so soon? Why was I so stupidly stubborn and refuse him time and again?  Why the hell do I torture myself like this.  Next topic... this week. The week... THE week... has been absolutely insane... Honestly its like I'm stuck in a snowglobe or something, the only thing glued down and then some child has shaken everything up and now everything has to settle and I'm just standing... glued in the center unchanging...  Am I unchanging? Whats changing around me?  It suddenly seems that everyone i know is going through a crisis, and I'm the solid one left untouched. Or I've already payed my dues and now..... ugh.. I just don't know. Friends everywhere are falling and I'm just.. here..... fuck.. that makes no sense.  Let's try it another way... the worlds gone mad. Period.  Except that I am going through a crisis... I think.. Its most certainly the most warped depression I've ever had...ever. I just feel like I'm falling underneath everyone elses burdens and I don't know why its happening. I figured out what its called though.  It's a crisis of faith.  I came to that conclussion completely on my own and without Roberts psycho-analyzing so I'm incredibly happy with myself. That unfortunately does not help me solve said crisis.  I just... don't know what else to say... I have some scary songs stuck in my head.. like Shinedown's "45"... and i can't stop playing it. I think I'm scaring myself...     What ever happened to the young man's heart Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart  And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45, Swimming through the ashes of another life No real reason to accept the way things have changed Staring down the barrel of a 45
