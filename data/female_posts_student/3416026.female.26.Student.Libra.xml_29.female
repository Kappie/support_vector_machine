Although in real life, I am a 100% Axl devotee, I have to say that Li'l Slash is my favorite here. Badass!  As I am sure you will, I like to picture them doing different Guns hits.  Unfortunately, the website does not include a setlist.  Do you think Alexa "Li'l Axl" Palminteri can handle the epic "November Rain?"  What about the whistling sequence in "Patience."  I just hope they don't do "One in a Million."  That one does not have a good message for children.
