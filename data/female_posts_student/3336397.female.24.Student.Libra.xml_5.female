I cant speak my mind and i hope somebody understands that i am really sorry , u know i feel guilty just becasue, i hate misunderstandings ,confrontations, but fucking why cant i just have a  say and people beleive me please . I should be happy today casue my exams are over anmd my couisn just delivered a babay girl. I am like officially a massi which is an amzaing feeling. But u know what i cannnot be ever successful as i am just too vulnerable and stupid and i not meant to be in this world.   Yesterday i went out , i had am amazing time. I danced a lot very part of my body was aching , i could not walk . I got up and straightaway went to the the open day and i really wanted to meet my friend cause it meant but i had to leave for Londong tommorow so i would have met and left in the morning. My friend though that it was just that i was not giving time it was nothing like that i have not done anythng in my house no laundry nothing , i wanted to buy somethig for the babay daughter. u know i did a big mistake i have a friend , she is just one friend who is genuine and i wanted to spend some time but u know i messed up again ust because i had to go meet my frined and family , my friend thought something else . I want to be happy i want to be bubbly , i dont want to cry more. Anyways i am messed up and i cant help myself so whats the use of writing.  i just did not mean to offend anyone, i just want to say sorry i wish i could just balance everything not let anything get on to my life.I just try to make things fine and i mess up> a person reading this should be thinking how sad i am , i am not like that. I always had people to talk to but i dont anymore talk to them becasue i just dont. I wish i could and i have stopped talking and that is why i have started writing , I just have one friend who i talk everything, that friend only is angry. u know what i can never be angry becasue i cant for long.
