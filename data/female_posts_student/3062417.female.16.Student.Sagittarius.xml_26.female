And to top things off I think I'm getting sick. Why do I always have to be sick on vacations?  Well right now I'm just sitting here being bored and listening to Allister. They are a good band. Everyone should check them out.  Song:  Well you think you know it all You think that you deserve the best, but I've got news for you Your bullshit smile can't pass this test Cause there's somethin that I've wanted to say I've wanted to say to you, woah I've been waiting to say to you, woah for so long  This time I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new This time I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new  Now I get sick of listening to your whining Cause you may have found success, but your still living life out lie Now I can't wait fot the day that you will burn out and fade away, woah You'll burn out and fade away from the world (woah)  This time I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new This time I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new   Why can't I understand your superficial views (woah), but I can understand I can't take much more of you?   Fuck you, I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new Fuck you, I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new  -"Know It All"- Allister
