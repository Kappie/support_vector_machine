Maybe i will have to buy myself a social life next time i venture into town.....     Finally some of that summer sun that everybody loves, but doesn't hardly know because its never there.     I would go and get a tan, but due to my unfortunate pale-ness,i go from red back to white again and never go even slightly brown.     Dam you skin....u win this time!     I really am looking forward to my birthday now.Probably because i saw my mums little book where she works out the bill's and shite.She really shouldnt write down what she has got planned for me and leave the thing lying around.     Well....it wasnt actually lying around, but in the cupboard in the kitchen on the top shelf.......              So for now     Goodbyb     XxXxXx             Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
