I arrived there after a fire, and a library, and then fleeing through several separate personas, and then the woman who had saved me took the jeep and started driving up.  She was going to places that she shouldn't be able to drive, up a mountain, past all the fences.  At the top I suspect that there was a view of the ocean, but I never made it that far.  The higher we walked after her, the more water there was, flowing in cold dramatic cascades.  The higher we went the sunnier the world became.  I didn't know how we would cross the raging torrents nearer the top, but we would find that out when we got there.  Now there was a shallow marsh in front of us, the kind you get at altitude, only this one sported its own field of wild strawberries as well.  It was fascitatingly lovely.  I had passed the bottle of salt which was put in my way on our upward journey, now, next to the strangely large berries (large for wild ones, but not mutant, just lush) there sat the bottle.  Next two it sat two smaller bottles, one labeled passion and one labeled love.  I took them both, assuming I would need both for the journey.  Once I took them I woke.
