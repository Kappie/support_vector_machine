I think that is when I posted last. I have to burn cds and get this package sent out to Hawaii. Class tomorrow. I can't wait for this class to be over so I can take one more math class and be done with all the numbers and formulas. Tomorrow I'm going to finally check out The Bourne Supremacy.       Friday is a Cub/Phillie match up in Chicago, trying to find some tickets, but the weekend seems jammed pack to be driving off into the west, watching a game. Now if Ryan Madsonwas pitching, it might be hard to say no.He is out 15 days, so that wont happen. Should post   urlLink  his pic   .  Dont hurt yourself now. =)   I had more I wanted to post, but damn the distractions. Cant think about it right now.   --------------------------------   The comments welcome section isnt working out how I planned. So who knows if it will continue.    peace.love.dmb.
