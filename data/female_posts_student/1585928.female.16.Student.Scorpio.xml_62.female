David M. went out of town the other day with Scott M. they just got back a lil while ago, and David missed me soo much.. He called me right when he got home! =) I missed him too actually!... I didn't get woke u at 1 in the morning and talk on the phone for hours... it was kinda odd!  but anyways... Yesterday I took off work, and Julie and I went to the mall to take something back.. then we went to Clinton!... we went to Jana's house and Brad, Matt, Jordy, and Jeffrey came over!, then we all left there and went to brad's house and Colby came over there! All the Boys were working on Jordy's truck, and me and Julie were bored so we asked Brad if we could take the Tahoe to Jana's house cause 'I forgot my money there', haha!, so he said we could go!, well we went riding all around Clinton! and everybody was staring at us, cause we were in the huge truck!, it was funn!!... then we went and 'met Dana and Jana's' and then we all went back to Brad's house!.. we chilled there a while!.. and Jason had planned to take me to the movies, but by the time him and Sean got done working out and playin basketball... it was like 8:00 and so we would have had to go to a late movie, and I had to be home by 11:30 and that wouldn't have worked!... so we decided to go another night!, but he met up with me, julie, Brad, Jordy, Dana, Colby, Matt.. > by the way Dana and I took a picture with the cow! haha
