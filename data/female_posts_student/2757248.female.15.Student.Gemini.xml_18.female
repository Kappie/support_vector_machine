AM HOMEROOM: OMG.. we have MAY CROWNING TOMORROW and we have to do the Rosary thingy. Yeah i didnt know what that was so i asked, despite the OMG URE DUMB look i got they told me. then asked if i was catholic. then i looked at him like he was dumb. IF I WAS CATHOLIC I WOULD KNOW WHAT THE ROSARY IS. But im DEFINATELY NOT looking forward to sayin Hail Mary's and Our Father's over EVERY BEAD on the necklace. 1-3: SCIENCE LAB- we shot our catapults. ours went 25ft. it ALMOST hit her. We got a 95.
