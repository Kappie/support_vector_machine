Gone through another girlfriend since the last time I wrote. I'm in love with the same guy I've been in love with for about half a year now. I've realized something though, about Mr. Unnamable. He's different from any other guy I've ever "had a crush on". I'm not occupied with wanting him, but wanting him to be happy. He's one of the, with lack of a more descriptive word, BEST people I've ever met. In my six months shy of a 15 year life span, I can count on one hand the number of people who have impacted my life like he has.   I love him.  But I can't have him. He doesn't like me. Even if he did, IF, (and he doesn't..), nothing could ever happen. Reasons: age difference, criminal record. Sorry for the detail deficiency.  This gives me two choices. 1) to say, "I hate my life. I love him, and he'll never feel the same way towards me. Even if he does, theres no way anything could happen between us. There's no reason to live anymore. Find me a cliff." or... 2) to say, "I love my life, thanks to him. Even though nothing could ever happen, I should be happy I got the chance to have him in my life, even just as a friend. I don't regret anything in my life up to the moment I met him. I can't imagine what my life would be like if I didn't, and to have him as a friend is better than nothing."  It might just be me, but the second one doesn't seem as messy.
