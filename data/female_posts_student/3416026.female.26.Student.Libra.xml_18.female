Now, I work in children's publishing so admittedly I am a little anal about things like this...  But I sort of thought we all agreed on the message that reading IS fun?    Snaps to the Chancellor for fucking that one up!  Oh, and speaking of illiteracy.  Did anyone read this week's  urlLink New Yorker  article about Schwarzenegger in which Connie Bruck mentions twice how much Arnold avoids reading anything, ever, at all costs?  I'm just saying.
