There is not a chance that I would ever tell them about that post...not that I tell them about any others...because they would get to excited.  "Yay!  Another way to shelter our youngest daughter!!"  Hey, has anyone noticed how Rosie is writing complete thoughts now?  It's amazing.  Hehe.    Yeh, Linds and I are going to the Lake that starts with a "J."  It should be fun...I guess.    Thanks for the well-wishing for the fifth of July, Linds.  Are you wearing jeans tomorrow?
