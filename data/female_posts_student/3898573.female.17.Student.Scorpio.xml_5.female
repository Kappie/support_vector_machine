So it's not going on my driving record or goin against my insurance. yay! :) I finally got to start taking birth control last Saturday. So now I've gotten a week of my pills down.  7 of 28! yay! That is actually really good news.  I don't know how long I'll wait, it looks like it'll be thru a whole pack before anything happens right now.  But I requested that next Saturday I get first shift so maybe he'll be able to stay the night and we'll see what happens.    Now is the stuff that will not have a Yay! after it.  Me and Jacob went to Angel's to have supper Wednesday night.  All was goin so good-the food was good, conversation flowed, it was great.   Then me and Angel were doin the dishes and Reece wanted to go show Jacob the antique sewing machine he had bought for $10 in the building.  Well, I was ready to go and I went out there after they'd been out there maybe 10 minutes, maybe 15 at the most.  I go to the door-it's locked.  Ok, that's weird.  But after a minute or two, Jacob comes and opens the door.  I walk into the building and PHOOF, there's this overwhelming smell of weed.  I was so hoping that that was just the smell that was left over from maybe earlier, but I kept looking at their eyes and at how they were acting to see if they had been smoking up.  Well, their eyes weren't bloodshot or puffy or anything and they seemed to be acting fairly normal, so I was becoming more and more hopeful.  Then when we left, I noticed that Jacob smelled of it rather strongly and started noticing him acting SO different.  When we got back to my house, we were in my room laying in the bed and he goes "I gotta tell you a secret" and then he didn't want to cuz he said I would be mad.  So he wanted me to just guess.  Well, I told him I wasn't guessing, that he just needed to tell me.  So he finally told me that him and Reece "burned one".  I told him I already knew cuz I could smell it and all and then I told him that I didn't like him when he was high, that I liked him better when he was not high.  He took so much offense to that, like I had just insulted him so personally.  Apparently, he took it as me saying that I didn't like him as a person, but I was just saying that I didn't like the way he acted when he was high.  So he started acting so weird.  He told me that if he had turned it down, it would have been disrespectful because Reece was offering to share his weed with him.  Yes, I see that, but isn't it disrespectful to me at the same time to get high at my sisters house in the first place?  It's like he chose to be disrespectful to me over Reece and I would think that he would respect me more.  I mean, it's like he didn't even think of me when he did it.  Another thing that really bothers me is that I had asked him before, like a week or 2 before, to not do it in front of me, and altho he didn't actually smoke it in front of me, he had to be with me right after.  I did, however, get him to promise to not get high at my sister's house again.  I don't know where he stands on this issue now-I haven't talked to him since.  He didn't get online or anything last night.  I hope I get to talk to him tonight becuase I want to ask him to go bowling with us Saturday night after I get off work.  But when I dropped him off at Mark's the other night, I tried to do damage control. When we were at the house before we left, he said he didn't feel like he should hug me back if I didn't like him then.  But he did hug me and kiss me before he got out of the car at Mark's.  I don't know if I fixed it or not, but I tried.  I guess I'll find out when I talk to him again.    Anyway, I'm tired of thinking about this and all.  I think I'm gonna get off here and get the mail-hopefully my Rae Rae has sent me something back...we'll see.  If I could just get a letter from Adam that would be cool too, he's been gone about 3 weeks now and still hasn't wrote me damn it!!!!  I also wanna take a long ass shower.  I'll try to update sooner next time.
