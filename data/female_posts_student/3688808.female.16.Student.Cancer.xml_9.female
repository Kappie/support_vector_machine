She's in the house 24/7, she has to put up with this bullshit day in, day out. Luckily I can escape for a while to my mates' houses but Kirsty can't. She's always been close to my mum, I've always been the independent one, which is why this must be rougher on Kirst than it is on me. I think tonight made her snap, I walked past her and saw her bottom lip wobbling and knew that something was up. I followed her into the living room where she collapsed onto the chair with her head in her hands crying her heart out. I know we don't get along much, but she's my baby sister and I couldn't just let her sit and cry with nobody to talk to, because I've done it and I know how it feels to be alone.   I managed to calm her down a bit and she told me what was wrong. It's my mum's birthday tomorrow and Kirsty wanted to make it special, so while I was over at Vinni's she asked my mum if she would drive her to Tescos (not telling her it was for ingredients for her cake). My mum said she'd take her at about 6pm. 6pm came and my mum told Kirsty that she was too tired to drive her, she needed a few hours sleep...so she'd take her at 8.30 instead. At 8.00 Kirsty went to wake up mum and mum said that she was getting up. Then at 8.15 Kirsty went to get her up again, and she was still asleep. 8.30pm came around and mum was in bed messing about with her prick of a husband. The dog was next to my mum, and he intentionally scared the dog. Therefore...dog jumps on mother, scratches mother in eye, mother then becomes too "ill" to take Kirsty to Tescos. Fair enough...just broken your daughter's heart but nevermind. If you can't keep the promises that you make...don't make them in the first place...simple as that! So Kirsty and I made a cake from what we could find in the cupboard, it turned out to be a lemon cake, basically a sponge slathered in lemon curd! It wasn't what Kirsty had hoped for, and she didn't think it was good enough, and she blamed herself.   Neither her or I have any money, and my mother knows that we can't afford to buy her a present at the moment, but apparantly she still sits there bragging to Kirst about how her husbands gonna buy her a diamond ring for her birthday. And how the fuck exactly is he gonna do that? When he's basically an asylum seeker on minimum wage who got laid off today? Smells like bullshit to me...   But even if it isn't bullshit, why would she sit there and tell Kirsty that? Why? Because she wanted to intentionally make Kirsty feel like shit for not buying her anything, That's fucking why. Kirsty also told me that my mum won't let her buy our dad a card for father's day. We're not allowed to visit his grave anymore either. She can fuck off if she thinks that's happening. She has NO right whatsoever to stop us from visiting our dad, and I'll be DAMNED if she's gonna try and prevent us from doing so. She's already taken down every picture of him in the house and thrown them in a cupboard because her new husband is uncomfortable with them being up. Just because she's cut my father out of her memory doesn't mean that Kirsty and I have to!   While I sat and hugged Kirsty and listened to her spill her heart out to me, I realised that we aren't that different afterall. We're sisters yeah, but we've never been really close, probably because she's always been joined to my mum at the hip. I told Kirsty that she had to turn this negative thing into a positive. Even though we're both being constantly let down by our mum, neglected even... she has to use this as a way to gain more independence. She has to become stronger from this, rather than weaker...   Tonight, for the first time in my life, I actually felt like a big sister. While I listened to Kirsty pouring out her heart, trying to fight back the tears, I realised just how much this was affecting her, how much she hates Nidhal and how much my mother is breaking her heart with no remorse.   All I can say now, is hold on babez, cos this shit won't last forever, I know you're hurtin' as much as I am but this will end someday. You'll get stronger and you'll be able to get through this. We've both had alot of shit in our lives that we didn't deserve, and I respect you so much for pulling through it, even though I don't show it. I know that every time they have an argument, it gets taken out on us...and I know that you think about running away, but don't. Don't leave me with them...ARRGGHHH =(   Seriously though, I love you to bits, don't let them get to you Kirsty cos you're stronger than that! Mwah x Oh yeah...and happy fucking birthday mum...enjoy your cake...
