I started off the pretty cool. I woke up all nice and stuff, and then today I had another officer work day. Well, that's where the frustrated part came in. Knowing that I am not the most outspoken person, I pretty much just let people walk all over me. I am supposed to be in charge of the call boards (one of the duties that I seem to only get control of), I wanted them to be PERFECT, and just great. Well, that plan didn't work out the way that I wanted to. I walk into the theatre department, and everyone's like okay, we are here to help you. Right....help me.....uh-huh. Well, I was like mmk, I can get all of my work done quickly. So, for the most part, it started out pretty well, that is until my job began getting taken away from me. I liked all of the call boards except the two in the front, which also happen to be the two most important ones. So, I was excited because I wanted those two to be the best ones. The fabic gets up there, but the borders were the borders that I didn't want. I was pissed. Let me back track though. Before we got to do the two front call boards, we had this meeting to make a big list. I was angry at the fact that I had to be on a committee that I don't want to be on. I know that I probably sound like a brat, but no one knows where I am coming from. I've been in that department for 4 years, and I always get stuck with something that I don't want to do. I think that I deserve more credit that I get. Well, I said that I will not contribute to Welcome Workshop if I have to be on that committee, and of course, no one listened to me. I am being completely serious. I don't give a damn if they get pissed at me, because I deserve to get what I want at times. I NEVER get what I want. All of my officer duties were taken away from me. Everything that I get assigned get taken over by some power greedy theatre person (no offense, but that's who most of them are). It REALLY ticks me off, but like I said, I am not outspoken at all, and even if I were outspoken, I wouldn't get heard. At times, THEATRE MAKES ME REALLY MAD. It's not the director's fault, it's the students. They have no trust, no admiration, no loyalty, no respect, and no manners to ANYONE, and I HATE THAT WITH A PASSION. Well, anyways, I didn't get to pick the borders, people were stealing my stuff, and I was just PISSED. So, I was like, well, I guess I'll have to re-do it later....which I am very sure I will end up doing....by myself. If I don't do things by myself, then I don't get things done correctly. No one wants to look at an ugly call board all year long. Well, after everyone left, I finally got some work done, but my mom came for me eariler then expected, so I didn't get ALL that I wanted done. So, when school begins, one late afternoon, when all of my homework is done I will redo all that I want to re-do. I appreciate everyone's help, but it was the wrong kind....no one had respect for me at all. So, after my mom picked me up, I got some McDonalds, and we picked up my sister from her friend's house, and then we ordered pizza, and then we got out hair done. So, the ending of my day was pretty good. I am glad that I am working tomorrow because then I won't have to be around those theatre people. [If you are wondering why I am in the theatre if I hate the people so much, it is because I have a love for the performance....not the people in it]. Wow, I typed a lot....I'm gonna stop now!
