Boy would that suck.  Anyways, my  school  just called (Hendrix) to confirm my visit monday. Oh boy oh boy.  I want this school year to just like...fly by. Because I'm ready to get away.  I'm supposed to have a date tonight...but I don't know if I wanna go and spread my diseases and such.  There is also a party tonight. Maybe I could just invite this guy (whatever-his-name-is-i-really-am-not-sure-but-hey-he's-hot-okay?) to this party. My God that boy called me about 5000034504304300 times yesterday. :- Blah blah blah I need a new job. Maybe I will go hunt for one today. In Southlake...so I won't end up with a job that's crappy like mine.  Maybe I will go shopping while I'm down there too.  :)  It's a date...with myself.  So last night we talked to this FRIKKIN KICK ASS COP in the Tom Thumb parking lot. He was cool as hell. He showed us all of his cool cop stuff in the back of his cop suv. Rofl, crazy awesome guy.  Alright. Meet you there crazies.
