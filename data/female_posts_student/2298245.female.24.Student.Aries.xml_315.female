I missed out on a fun trip for dumplings in Chinatown and a fun movie viewing experience because of my stupid procrastination.  The final draft of my directed research paper is due tomorrow (well, technically, today as it is already after midnight), and of course, I put off working on it so I had to spend the whole day working on it.  It's a cautionary tale, but I'm quite sure if I haven't gotten the lesson by now, it isn't going to come.  Now for the random mutterings.  I've been thinking about Jerry Orbach's exit from "Law  Order" this season, and how the show could send him off with a little fun, and while listening to the CD of  The Fantasticks  today, it came to me.  And I'm requesting in advance that you not be offended by what I'm about to type, because if you haven't seen the show or are not familar with the music, then what I'm about to say might be a little strange.  Jerry Orbach was in the orignal cast, and he plays this unsavory sort of character who at one point is hired by two of the characters to abduct someone.  As they plan the crime, Orbach's character says that "the proper word is rape."  He then starts to sing, a long and loud recitation of the word "rape."  It isn't funny in the abstract, of course, by in context, it is humorous, though I suppose you'll just have to take my word for it.  Or go out and buy the CD.  Anyway, so I thought it would be (funny?  no, perhaps just interesting) if the detectives on "Law  Order" were investigating a little rape/murder (now I smell a cross-over with SVU...mmmm), and instead of the usual quip before the commercial break, he could do a rendition of the beginning of the song:  "Ra-a-a-pe."  But perhaps this is too sick.  No one would get it, and they'd all be offended.  Definitely few would get it.  It would be like that time that I was watching "Boy Meets World," and Mr. Feeney (played by William Daniels) cracked a quip about  The Graduate  (which William Daniels was in) being a great film.  But I digress...Ah, yes, I was just dragging myself back to work, after alienating half my readership (read:  2 of you) by cracking jokes about rape.
