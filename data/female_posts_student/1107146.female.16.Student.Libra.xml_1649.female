Most of it I don't really mean.  I'd like things to get better for him...yeah, I do... Um, what else?  Stupid psych quiz tomorrow.  Guess that means we're actually starting the school year now.  Hmm... Anyway, I'm trying to put off doing my homework as long as possible, but I think I better go now.  I'd make this longer but my mom spilled coke on this keyboard and it's hard to use the top row of keys and it's getting extermly annoying.  I'll hit a key on the top row and then a key on the middle row and the middle key will "strike" first.  ok, enough rambling.  homework.
