He especially liked the guitar and vocals.  One day, he met a girl called... Jane. At first they hated each other... completely drove each other up the wall. That's why Jane stole his guitar. Which Adam got a little bit annoyed about and ripped her dress. Then things got  real  bad. --censored-- And then jane moved away. Which was just as well because Adam had been planning to set Jane's house alight. Fifteen years later, Adam moved away too. And Jane moved away from where she moved to after meeting Adam.  Perhaps it was fate.. or perhaps it was because they had dodgy estate agents.. but whatever the reason, they managed to end up in the same district.. and even on the same road.  "Oh my God.. Adam Levine?" "What?" "It's me, Jane!" "Jane?" "Jane Cai." "Wha..?" "I stole your guitar in 4th grade?" "My guitar? Errrr..." "Oh never mind." Jane didn't think anything of it. But she hadn't really expected him to have gotten so... fit. Which is why she didn't dream about him, or him and his guitar, or him ripping her dress that night... Not at all! **A week later** Adam runs up to Jane as she sets off to Sainsbury's. "Jane Cai!!!! I remember you!" "Really?" "Yeh! You know, I had a major crush on you in 4th grade.. right after you stole my guitar. In fact, right up to when you left really," he says, blushing.  Jane didn't want to admit it but she did too. Right after he tore her dress.  Part 2 coming soon.
