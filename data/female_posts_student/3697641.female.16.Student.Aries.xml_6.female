(on the edge of reality and dreaming, fragile and wanton)   and (you'll find) my colours aren't brilliant  and my wings are easily torn. but the good thing about paper is that it can be taped back together  multiple times and it's the little indiscretions like these that make us grateful for  scotch tape  and staples.   but you, no, you were never one for patchwork. too revealing, you said as i stripped away my skin and you watched. i danced and we gave birth to sin in your arms.   and i was never one for paper planes, but you persisted, and so i let you fold me up and slip me into  your back pocket  for later dates and rainy days. [i think the concept of flight eluded you, as you steamrolled my hopes and left bits of denim imprinted on my skin] but it's alright. i didn't have anywhere else to be, anyway.   (and it's in times like these that i can't seem to get enough of scotch tape.)   i am cheap and see-through.   [exposed]
