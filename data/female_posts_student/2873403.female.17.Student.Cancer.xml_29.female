Then I went to Nick's house, and a bunch of his relatives were there for his confirmation thing. His 2 cousins were like in awe of me... It was crazy. Crazy little kids... They were all like playing with my hair and telling Nicky to kiss me haha, it was great. Then Rob said he was going to ride his bike over, so we decided to walk to his road to meet him, so we sat on this big rock on a hill across from a lake (so poetic-ish, haha). We were waiting for like 20 minutes, and Rob never showed, so we went back to Nick's house and it turns out, Rob walked in the front door at the exact same time we walked out the back door. How nuts is that? So Rob was all like on the computer playing games and I fell asleep on the floor, then we had food and watched "My Cousin Vinny." Then Rob left as well as Nick's family members and I went back to sleep on the floor with my pillow/ Nick and then I went home at 11 and went to sleep in my bed.  Then today, Nick came over and we watched "Malibu's Most Wanted" and "Viva La Bam" and he beat me up (mwahaha) and such then he went home (sad face). Then I ate star soup and learned 110 SAT words then got all crazy confused. It was an enjoyable time. Now I'm going to go converse with el chico and eat veggie lasagna, all gangsta-retarded Garfield style.
