An excellent documentary,  urlLink The Future of Food,  by Deborah Koons Garcia, exposes how little we know about the foods we eat. For years we've all been eating genetically modified food and never been made aware of it because of lack of product labeling. Garcia's film is chilling, not just for what it spells for the future, but because of what she uncovers happening everyday  already .  While the film is still screening at festivals nationwide, it will also be available at the end of July on VHS and DVD for $20. You can purchase your copy at the  urlLink Future of Food  site.
