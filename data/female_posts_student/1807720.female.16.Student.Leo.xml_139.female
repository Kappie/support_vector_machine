And well English was boring as usual, but she asked me to read so I felt special, lol.  In Active Living we did the 30 minute run and I was STARVING by the end of it, but I found it pretty easy.  So then after I was like "LETS EAT, EAT, EAT, and I think I annoyed like everyone.  But I am good now, on a full stomach.  We had pitas today - YUM...
