It was a film documentary and the relationships between Bush and the Enemies Allies. I mean it was interesting to learn about what happen, it was sad but it was a disgrace. It makes me hate Bush even more, what a dumb ass president, what an idiot. I cant wait for the new election in November. I strongly encourage people to see this movie and not be a dumb fuck to vote for this selfish man again. He has put too many people lives in danger not to mention he also cheated to become president. So people, beware of who you vote for....
