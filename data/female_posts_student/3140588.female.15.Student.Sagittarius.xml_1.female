"i've found a reason to show, a side of me you didn't know, a reason for all that i do. and the reason is you. i've found a reason for me, to change who i used to be, a reason to start over new. and the reason is you." wow it all makes sense. haha anyways. i'm going to go watch punk'd, do my homework, kind of, and finish painting my toenails. i have a feeling tomorrow might be a good day.
