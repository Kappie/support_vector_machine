Just havin' the time of my life, here. I need to learn two songs by tomorrow, one of which i DON'T HAVE MUSIC FOR. Sure, easy enough, right? Just get the music off the bus from the magic red bag. Hah. Yeah, tried that. "Welcome Here Again" is nowhere to be found. So Emily, the snare player, tried to write up some music for me. Tried being key word there. Then they made her give the recruits a lesson, and she gives me this frightened look, so I promise to help her. After Steve and Ben leave, she turns to me and says: "I feel so guilty, giving them a lesson. I mean, I don't even know what I'M doing..."  Then I came home, and had dinner. We had those little microwavable hotdog singles wrapped in soft taco shells, because we didn't have rolls. I uh...had an interesting time with that. I sorta didn't know the hotdog would be THAT hot, so i threw it onto my plate from six feet away. Hah. I went to throw away the wrapper from the hotdog, and didn't know there was hot oil in it...it sorta burned me, and i dropped it, my mother laughing at my stupidity. Then I sit back down, eat, and when I get up to put my plate in the sink, my mom bursts out laughing. I say "What?" and she just points at my pants, laughing hysterically. I find that I have sat on a paper bag with tape stuck to it, so that it was hanging off my butt looking like a weird tail. Ah, good times.  Today, i worked from 8:00-1:00...and haven't gotten to take a shower yet. Fuuun. I gave three puppies baths and groomed them. They, of course, like to roll around in their urine, so they smell TERRIBLE and have mats, flees, and dandruff. Fuuun. Well, they don't really like baths. Or nail clippings. Or being brushed.  I learned how to operate a blow dryer today! Normal people use hair dryers on their hair...I use them on dogs...well, I didn't know how to use one, because if you blowdry my hair I come up looking like one of two things: 1.) I stuck my fingers in an electrical socket. 2.) Mrs. Hoffacker.  With love, April
