The Capital Markets Board of Turkey now requires that all employees in the investment banking sector obtain licenses to resume their current positions and this license will be awarded to people who pass this exam made up of all kinds of subjects ranging from financial math to economics to what not. I understand that this is what the European Union is doing and we would like to be a part of the Union and so on. How was my exam? Never mind. Actually, I didn't bring up the subject to discuss the exam. The only good part of it was the exam site. It was held at the premises of Istanbul University which is amazingly beautiful. The university lies on the other side of the Bosphorous in what we call 'the old city' where all the grand mosques, cisterns, Hagia Sophia, the Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar are. It's far away from where I live.   In the 3-hour interim between the morning and the afternoon sittings (yes, the exam was supposed to last a total of 6 hours in two sittings held on the same day, never mind how much of it I could take!!), I wandered around 'the old city'. In that part of Istanbul, tourists outnumber the nationals by the way. Strolling around and watching tourists it just happened that I started seeing the city, my city, the way tourists see it. At least the way I think they see it. On the way back home I skipped public transportation and walked all the way down to the seaside and stood there for a long time watching the Galata Tower and the intricate web of old houses surrounding it. It all seemed so different to me. I have seen this view countless times before yet it felt as if it was the first. I felt as if I was watching a movie. I was completely out of it all and stood there in awe. How lucky I am to be living here I thought.   Then I took the ferry to the Anatolian side and on the ferry I sat outside in the wind and watched the sea and the city skyline. I tried to locate exactly at what points in the picture most of my life is spent. Where I work, where I live, the favorite places I visit. I imagined myself in those places and looking at Istanbul from the outside I felt a stranger although I make miles ang go distances in it everyday.   Then everything just clicked into perspective for a split second. I sensed that If I can look at my life, myself, and what I do from the outside instead of drowning myself in daily trivia, everything will become clearer. By zooming out, I will actually be able to bring into focus the things of real importance. New ways to see old things will maybe then appear.
