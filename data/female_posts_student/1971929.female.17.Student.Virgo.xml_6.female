I've been getting horrible random pains since Saturday afternoon and they tend to last for a few hours, then get worse for like five minutes, then suddenly go away. I'm not sure that's a bad thing, but I know it's not good. Not to mention the fact that I still haven't gotten a ticket and it's starting an hour earlier than it would have on Friday. I don't want to be a burden on my Warped Tour companions. All I'll do the whole time is be like "Oh... I don't feel well... I'm going to sit down." And they'd be like "Ugh!" and that would be their way of expressing their annoyance. So, I feel it's better that I don't go. Therefore, the saga ends with only three parts to it. Shame on me.
