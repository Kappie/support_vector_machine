After that me and amez and kayla decided to grab a late lunch (try 3:00) at O'Charleys and then go get our nails done. Well, this is a great idea and I had an awsome time cept for the fact that we all had to run across the street. The street i'm talking about is that one that goes between the target shopping center and the Michales/Petsmart shopping center. I almost got hit by a car, and we looked like absolute idiots but it was so much fun. What sucks is not have a car. no me gusta. I got tips put on my nails. they look pretty :) After we got our nails did, we went to targay to pick up la picutras from the SD trip. They're all really good, cept that I don't have any pictures of the people we met there, or where we stayed, so i'm gonna' need to borrow some other people's pictures and copy them. Then i came home and got to see my cousin Emily (she's 3) and that was cool b/c i never get to see her. She's spoiled rotten but she's such a sweety.  My Dad's trying to change my flight date from August 1st to august 2nd or something so i can go to Mr.Bill's house on august 1st and we can do the whole swap pictures and pick out which ones we like thing. Apparnetly, it's hard to change flights. This i did not know. Anyway, I found two really cool quotes today. One I stole from amez who stole it from the new movie I, Robot :*sneeze* sorry i'm allergic to bullshit. I thought that was pretty funny. haha. The next one i got from watching dawson's creek (I know, it's such an old show, and no one watches it but i like it. what can i say, i'm justa *dork*): "If you can feel comforatable not knowing...you can learn anytyhing, anything; and if not, well then you've stopped before you've begun". I thought it was kinda' neat. Anywayz that's all for tonight folks. Caio-  Liz
