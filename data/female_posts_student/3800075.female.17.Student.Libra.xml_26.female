Hmm, From Dusk Till Dawn.... i havent really been watching but i dont think im digging it. I'm talking about a Great White chiefy! :) So yeah. today was good. I woke up round 12 went to a bridal shower... god my face hurt- i think once i got in my car to start driving i still had the fake "smile for the family" smile on. Long gone now though- i hate that smile. I like real smiles and real laughs although i give more than my fair share of fake ones. Hmm i just realized my undies are inside-out. fucking Crazy. But yeah after the bridal shindig Michelle and I went to goosetown. It felt really good to do something. We decided that we'd start going regularly- we'll see. i hope so. Then went home, let the tv speak to me took a shower and went to get michelle for some dinner(gained back the calories.) Jacklie wasnt home and leslie already ate. Afterward we drove around. It was Awesome! we had such a good talk. I enjoyed it muy. It's good to talk about anything, or nothing whatever it may be. I like communicating, i cant stand the people who are intellectually lower than or at about the same level of just their stereos- or trumpets, ah hmm humm hmm. Dont get me wrong, music is life. But i mean it as if you cant get past... well fuck to put it bluntly i just mean those who are intellectually challenged. Hmm. perhaps thats bad to say but thats all that comes out.   Haha casey took this pic of Janni and sam pulled his ass out just in time for jonni's sweet little head to hit his cheek.  now that is a great picture!!  Aww janni he is such a sweetie i dont know if he was just being nice but he looked at my senr pics (why so early!) and told me that i was a vision.  Jonni jon jonny :)  beautiful boy.  No nathan today- perhaps tomorrow ehh?!  Well anyhoo im gonna hit the hay.  And for today....I'm thankful for my wonderful friends!!  (as michelle might say) Until Time Next
