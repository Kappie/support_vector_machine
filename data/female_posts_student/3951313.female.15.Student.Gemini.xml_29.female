When I know all the dangers lurking there  Don't try and comfort me  When you're the one who made me cry  Don't try and give me a kiss  When a few hours ago  you were smoking weed with the guys  I know your lies  I know your tricks  So why do I give in?  Why don't I just get rid of you forever?  It's so simple  One little word  But I can't  I'm too scared  You know so much  Too much  So I go back  I always go back   maybe someday  I'll say NO   you'll leave  for good  But until then...  I just keep on going  Back to you
