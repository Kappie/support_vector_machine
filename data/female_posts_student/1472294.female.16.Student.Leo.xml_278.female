Ooops, sorry for the long wait for whoever has been waiting patiently to see if I have any updates. Yes, I have finally realised that Windows XP made my blog look like a rubbish dump. I used to use Windows 98, but I have since 'upgraded' to Windows XP. For the few months I'm not here, I have totally given up on this blog, becoz of the codes. But now, I will just stick to the templates that Blogger has. Hope it works and my blog will look much more neater. ^^ I was in LiveJournal for the past few months and have made many friends who also love SDs and AI. SDs is known as Super Dollfie. Oh, did I ever mentioned that I have purchased a MSD-Mini Super Dllfie? Her name is called Natsumi. Very sweet and pretty. So, I will just end here, if you wish to read my LJ, feel free to browse, it's more stable down there in terms of LJ structure and entries. I may need a little more time adjusting to this new Blogger. Oh, and Happy 1st birthday to my blog, it is 1 year old plus plus already.
