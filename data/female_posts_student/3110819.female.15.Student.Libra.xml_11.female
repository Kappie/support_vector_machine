(cbs movie, i know, but still) I totally realllllly wanna see Van Helsing, but of course, being where i am, that's not gonna happen. we never get any good movies. even if we get it next week, doesn't matter cause it's tulip time and you never go to movies during tulip time. o well.  i am soooo psyched. we're gonna get a new music store in town, opening sat., that sells vinyl. i have been dying to expand my collection and maybe get a record player, but i've never had the oppurtunity. now i do. yay!!!  i really need to clean my room. well then, moving on...  angel was pretty good last night. it almost killed me when i thought everybody was dead. i knew they couldn't do that at this point in the season, but still. scared the crap outta me. next week looks really good though. i know buffy isn't gonna be on, but a buncha others will.  you know what really irritates me? when people, who have NO idea what they're talking about talk trash. like, being the loser w/o a liscence i am, i'm riding the bus home today, and some middle schooler asks what a hacker is. so another one of them's like, oh, they're a loser who gets into people stuff and wrecks it. i'm sitting back there thinking, what a buch of ignorant people. not everyone w/ the ability to hack does that. it's like this one time. there were only a couple of people in the classroom (i don't remember why) and my teacher said something about not being able to eat. a kid asked why, and she said it was because she was getting blood taken. then the kid's like, 'oh, i thought you were one of those crazy catholics'. and i, being catholic, was 'like, yeah, us crazy catholics' he kinda shut up then. his look of embarassment was enough for me.  i'm totally wiped. shower time.
