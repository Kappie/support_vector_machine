There were so many times when this year seemed like it would never, ever, ever, ever end. but its almost over. and summer's almost here. summer with its freedom. from school and from homework and work in general and from never being able to see emily! Im soooo looking forward to that. seeing emily often. cant wait, cant wait, cant wait.       so lets see... this week has been pretty good...in that last week of school kind of way. I had a lot of homework last night, but i conquered it. Wrote an in-class essay today that i was satisfied with. Lost my watch though. :'(. hopefully voelker still has it. and...hmm...we got yearbooks. despite what some people say, i like the ones this year better than last year. At least in terms of cover. I gotta  figure out when im signing emilys yearbook...hopefully i can take it home. but i dunno what she wants to do about mine. we'll see i guess. And i gotta get soooo many people to sign my yearbook tomorrow! i only have a few and i gotta get like a million more of my good friends cause ive been lazy and putting it off. And...hmm...      today i didnt have any homework and that was nice...so i went out to dinner with caitlin. we went to benigans. good times. and...hmm...chem shirt day tomorrow! wooooo. cant wait. They are truly awesome shirts.  hmm...wow...not a whole lot to say, actually. i might go see shrek 2 tomorrow ith caitlin and lingus. i want to see troy. maybe my mommy will take me? itd be cool to see pasch again too...cause thad be like 3, maybe even 4 weeks in a row. which is CRAZY. but definitely in a good way. oh well. at least, there will be calling.     ooooh, and i gotta figure out about the assembly tomorrow too. crazy crazy assembly. hmmm...  i think im gonna go now...ill write more later. i promise.
