So yeah...*sigh* Today was alright....work up round 10:30...which is really early considering I went to be after 3...*shrug* And I mainly just layed around all day....I woked in my closet for 2 hours...Thats one heck of a job. I think its never ending...Its pretty bad in there. Yeah. Now Im just sittin here being bored....I hope im not getting sick cuz it might just be from all the dust n stuff...but I can't stop sneezing and blowin my nose. Its annoying....and now my throat is starting to hurt. Great. Just what I need. Tho it seems like every year around my Dads birthday something happens...Im either sick...or in ER.
