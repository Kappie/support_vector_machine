But, using computers in internet can sometimes be really difficult.   Not everyone knows the universal language of english very well, which limits internet usage quite a bit.... and even if you do know the basics of computers, the language, and even some html (which is not common with 'earthlings' i.e. non IT-pros) a lot of problems occur if you try to do things beyond your skill.  The most irritating thing that can happen (which sometimes does in my case) is that you have a good friend who is an IT-university degree graduate and who knows wayyyyy beyond you, to the level of expertiese. Because this friend thinks the basics to be so easy peasy, he "forgets" to concider how those incredibly easy things can be overwhelmingly difficult to you. In the end, it tends to go to "let me do it for you" and what is the result? The 'earthling' doesn't know one bit more as she/he did before. The next time some problem occurs, it's even easier to let your independence go and have things done for you, instead of trying to learn more about the tool you are using.  As I use my laptop quite a lot, and yet know too little about it, I clash with problems a lot.... Most of the time I try to solve them by myself but there's one indeniable area where I'm a complete moron. But, I can say that even my IT-friend hasn't been able to solve it the way that would satisfiy me... I think he finally gave up on me and my lappy after a series of childish and angry tantrums from my part, that he just noted "well, they work fine for me". And the issue here was internet security. Zone Alarm and Windows' own firewall. Either my computer has developed AI of its own with a very stubborn and un-cooperative attitude just like me, or then there is a solution no one hasn't discovered yet. LOL!  I think this was all for today, ladies and gentlemen. And remember....comment, comment ;)
