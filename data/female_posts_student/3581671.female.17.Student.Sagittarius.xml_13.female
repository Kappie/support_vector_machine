My final is on Monday.  hummmm  every smile you make every claim...  anyway, today is FRIDAY!! yeah! school is out in 7 days! Woo-hoo.  And I've made the past two days without taking my mid-day nap.  I am tres excited because I turned in my eight page essay worth 20% of my grade in AP US history.  My classes are going pretty well except my math class.  Today my teacher made me cry for the third time this try.  Every time I ask a question (after I have asked my peers if they know the answer) she just stares at me and makes me feel like an idiot.  If no one else knows the answer to my question, then I think it might be a legit quiestion.  I was just wondering if I'm just too sensitive or if she may have a biased feeling towards me.  oh well.  maybe I'll just go to reatyourteacher.com and give her a bad grade.  He he he.. revenge is sweet.  so.. that's all for the moment, take it ans seize it! katie
