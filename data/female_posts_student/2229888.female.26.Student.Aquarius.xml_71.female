Today I decided to act on the feeling I've been having to leave Ant. It has been a plan in the back of my mind every since he choked me at Steph's house.  It wasn't worked out or anything, but as I've said before, I've been keeping my eyes open for a good opportunity to ge tout of this mess. When I saw it, I took it.  I'm more than a little bit scared. Not of Ant, but of the idea of being a single mom. I wonder if I'll be able to cut it out there in the real world. I just don't know.  I'm gonna try, though.
