It really sucks...I start thinking of what to say...and then tell myself it's pointless or stupid and work up all these dumb thoughts and get myself all nervous.  I'm such a freak, that is really what I am.  I don't know what to do about this silly problem of mine, I really don't.  I make myself angry, but then again my mother makes me angry and school makes me angry.  Am I angered to easily?  I think I'm dramatizing...nothing.  I'm taking a problem that doesn't exist and creating it and just making myself feel confused.  Someone just needs to smack me and I wake up from my little world and feel normal.    Anyways, enough of...whatever that was.  If you haven't seen Thirteen you should go rent it.  It's EXTREMELY good, I have it now :)  It's about a girl whose life pretty much just goes to shit overnight.  Well...I really don't feel like explaining it, go pick it up and read the back of it...or something.  But it's really good,  it's up there next to my favorite, Girl Interrupted.  Nice demented movies about people who aren't doing so well upstairs.  woo...i just need to go to bed. Good night.
