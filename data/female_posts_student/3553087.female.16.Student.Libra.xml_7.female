MAYBE once in a while, but thats only if you can handle it without getting out of control. thats what i think.  anyway, my mom said phil and matt cambpell came over here three times looking for me this morning while i was asleep. then they came back after i woke up asking if i knew where to get a blunt. lame. but they hung over here for a while, then went to peters. brian and that chick amy came over there and she was fuckin starin hard like she never saw a black person before. ever since i met her shes always looked at me like that. you know how ussualy when you catch somebody staring at you they turn the other way? not her. she does the same thing every time..she looks at my shoes and then slowly makes her way up to my face and just fucking stares like she wants to fight or something. at least i hope thats what she wants. i mean believe me, i'm pretty much trysexual but theres no chance in hell i'd give her more than a second glance. she looks too awkward and bony. and her face looks like a horse or something. i dunno its weird. anyway..raber asked me if i had been talking shit about him cause he heard i was but i was like no cause he was my ride home and besides he gave me some icecream. lol. i still will never like that guy tho. he can't be trusted...two faced. maybe someday i'll tell him. but does that also make me two faced for acting like his friend when im around him, but talking shit behind his back? im a hypocrit. oh well..he started it.  at the end of this week im going to my dad's and im staying there for like a week. that should be cool.
