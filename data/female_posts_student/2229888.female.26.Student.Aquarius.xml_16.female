They didn't want to live with Mom and Dad anymore . . .      Our young childhood was enveloped in Mom's love . . .Dad's also . . . Even toward the end of our living with them, we heard "I love you." everyday . . . we hugged alot . . . we shared secrets and laughter . . . it really doesn't make sense . . . .     But there was abuse also . . . On the other side of love, hate.     A thin line does exist between the two. I know. My brothers and sister know.       When people see me as a selfless person, though I say nothing, (having learned quickly that any arguements make me sound like I'm trying to be modest . . . or fishing for compliments) I know the truth.     I am the oldest child of four, and that is, at this time in my life, my main idenity. I love my brothers and my sister. I want my family to be together. I love being able to give the two youngest, (with the much appreciated help of my 20 year old brother) as much of a normal life as I can.     I like all of this, not because I am selfless, (my personal view is that selflessness does not exist in one's self . . .only in a person's outside perspective of another person . . . people do things that seem selfless to us because it is the way they are built to act or it is how they want to act) but, because I like to be needed, and it gives me a sense of purpose, without my having to find it on my own. What I will do when my reign as parent to them ends is more frightening than knowing each day that I must try to do what is right. (All of us who care, most o fthe time, about right and wrong know that the prospect of acheiving "right" is a scary one, since right and wrong are often gray text.)      I have to fight myself daily to keep from smothering and pulling my little brother and sister. I am just wholly glad to be aware of this truth. The only chance in overcomig a vice is to know of it's existence.      Please bear in mind when reading these pages that I am not old enough nor intelligent enough to know everything you might know, if you are, indeed, older and more intelligent than me. I am, however, old enough to know as much as I can know, which is to me, everything . . .      I am aware of the fact that my version of truth may be naive` in another's eyes, but I refuse to use my words wisely in order to appear wise . . .I prefer to be genuine in my thought, even if those thoughts are laughable to some . . .      I am also aware that my form of speech in writing will seem unrealistic to some . . .that is okay . . . no one really knows when another is "real" anyway . . .especially since the definition of "real" is also a grey thing to behold . . .             UPDATE:  We have worked things out with our parents and are now living in south carolina with them . .. We've been separtated for eight months  . . . .Will we survive together? We'll see . . . :)
