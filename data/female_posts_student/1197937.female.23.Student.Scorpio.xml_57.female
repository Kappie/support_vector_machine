The European support for international rules and institutions -- from the european union to the united nations -- extends that principle to govern the relations between nations."  (sorry, decided to just take excerpts...underestimated darn tiny newspaper font.)  "Yet this core philosophy seems the real source of the european conflict with bush. at home and abroad, bush's priority is the opposite: he consistently aims to reduce constraints on individual choice, even when that weakens collective institutions...Bush's tax cuts, for instance, put more income back in ind. pockets, but at the price of eviscerating (???) govt revenues that support activities society can undertake only collectively...On social security and medicare, bush's vision is to give individuals increased choice -- at the price of almost certainly diminishing the universal benefit guaranteed to all...  Bush's foreign policy vision follows the same principles... ...on Iraq, Bush was willing to engage the UN, but only to a point. in the end, bush was unwilling to launch an invasion that he believed eessential to nat'l security. ...no u.s. president would strike the balace as far toward europe; it's not in america's genes. but in his domestic and foreign policies, bush seems esp distant from the european model; in many of his actions -- from his emphasis on tax cuts to his rejection of a meaningful UN role even in postwar iraq -- he seems actively hostile to it. after the war, bush and european leaders may talk of reconciling. but the chasm betw them -- less on the use of force than on the val. of collective action -- virtually guarantees more storms across the atlantic."    okay, i really regret having typed this thing, even excerpting was way longer than i imagined. the author sounds pretty anti-bush, but tone aside, which is better policy wise? i know it almost seems obsolete to still be talking about the war, but hello, the war only began like, little over a month ago?? and the front pages have already been replaced with these sensational stories about sars. this is just like what happened in chicago, the movie, when roxie's trial ended. again, can i just say that that was a great movie?? seriously, give me any random situation and i will make a reference back to that movie. anyway, my lsat teacher, dale, aka my NFL rookie, told us that the most effective way to make progress towards a better score is not to keep doing new problems endlessly, but to go back and spend time pondering the problems that we've already done. there's no better way to learn. in case you're not sure, i will tell you right now that i am trying to be clever and make an analogy here. history has ALWAYS been told from the pt of view of the victors. since we're living the history right now, we have the choice to not be "ejucated" on  what to think. man, if i started this blog earlier, it woulda been a lot more coercive, but right now, my bed looks absolutely delicious to me. so your turn to talk. g'nite future churchills hemingways and newtons.
