I only need braces, no head gear. :)  I get the mold htingy of my teeth next week, then I have to wait 2 weeks and have a consultation, then I get the appointment made to get my braces on.  Hmm.  It wont be that bad. maybe I will  get gold braces like Aaron. Haha. get some bling bling on my choppers.   Later.  Lawwww-ra
