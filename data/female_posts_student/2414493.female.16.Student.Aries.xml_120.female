Ed the photographer's coming to Grandma's 80th birthday dinner. I'm repulsed. There's just something about him and mom's obsequiousness and...well, call me crazy, but he could be the perfect pedophile. Or I could see mom, in her helplessness and naivete, liking him too much.   It's really a matter of intuition, this Mom and (insert a male hired help/acquaintance here) kind of suspicion. I know it's completely unfounded, but I just get funny feelings sometimes. Mom, by nature, is just so helpless, so eager to depend on other people, even if they aren't family. First it was Mr. Jeng. While I was being tutored (for Analysis, but that's another story) she would always ask to borrow a book and then sit on the couch. And then ask to take the book home, etc. Or, "Is there something I can do?" And then always going over to the Jengs' house. Maybe it's because of CCCA. Or maybe it's something else. And then there's Ed. "Is my dress all right?" asked Mom in a truly infantile manner, dressed in a contraption probably purchased before I was born. Eyeshadow, too. I remember the time she just globbed that lavender stuff on for MT. Tiff, ever the nice one, rubbed it off for me. "That's too much," she said. Back to Ed [involuntary shudder]. I just can't believe Mom asked him to come. I was napping yesterday and heard her talking to him on the phone. Luckily (or not), I fell asleep soon after that. I simply can't imagine him sitting there with a bunch of our relatives eating as course after course comes in. That's just not right! He's supposed to take pictures again. Save me, please. I think I just might go to Jess's ASG dinner and stare at the Eiffel. And eat creme brulee.  This thing with Mom and adultery: I'm sure it's pure fabrication from an idle mind (mine). Or maybe. It's just that her personality naturally entails that she's just weak around white hired help. Or Mr. Jeng. But I get the sense that yes, Dad's pretty laid back (boring?). He doesn't come home until late. Even now, on a Saturday afternoon, he's at work. I've actually had dreams where Mom runs away with someone (gets a divorce?) and Dad, Austin, Grandma and I have this empty marble house to ourself. But I like it, strangely enough. If Mom weren't so needy I wouldn't be afraid at all. But because she is, I keep on churning out fancies.  Just make Ed go away. Please. I don't hate anything specific about the man. It's simply intuition. But being the heart over head person I am, I still don't like it.   I drive, and I see college decals in the back windows. I imagine the triumphant day when I can stick a Harvard one to mine. But then I laugh. Who am I kidding?
