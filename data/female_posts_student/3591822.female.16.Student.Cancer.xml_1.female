At dinner today Stephane was like "why are you excited? you're only turning 15." and I'm like "good job, way to know how old your sister is. Way to imply I'll graduate at the age of 16."   We're going to get our HORRIBLE computer fixed soon! Mom was trying to add up how much it would be. We need to fix the sound, get a new printer and get a new moniter (just for it to function, not for it to be good) If it's worth it we may just get a whole new everything!! Woah I just remembered we have a scanner. I don't think it's EVER worked :S We should get a new scanner too. And a webcam. *sigh* excuse me for dreaming.  3 minutes 4 days.  Me and Samia suck so much. Today all we did was bug boys, watch Barney and play Wheel of Fortune on N64. You see, I hooked up all the exciting (aka old) electronics in my room. I now have a TV that my parents bought in Germany in the 80's, an almost-as-old-as-that VCR, a SNES and a N64. We have a really odd selection of games for those that my bro's friend gave to us. It includes wheel of fortune, double copies of at least 3 games, lots of wrestling games and a game shark.   Back to me and Sam, while watching Barney we were singing along and making fun of the small children. THEN we noticed one of the samll children DID NOT HAVE A RIGHT HAND. You couldnt tell cuz she was always holding it in her left hand. BUT THEN she hugged Barney and it just wasn't there and we were like EEK.   please excuse me I have to go watch the super fun elections. GO BLOC QUEBECOIS GO!! (lol no, never)  LESS THAN 4 DAYS
