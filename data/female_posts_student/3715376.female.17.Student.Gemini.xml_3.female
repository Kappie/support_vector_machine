My sister Anne (16) has gone off to Jutland for the week with a friend from class, and my brother Christian (19) is touring Berlin with his band. So its been nice getting to know the new hosties better.   So... my host family have just finished booking the accomodation to Austria and the Czech Republic, where we are spending around 2 weeks in beautiful central europe! On monday night my host mum and I took a spur-of-the-moment bike trip to the local library to get some travel guides for Prague (they even got a Lonley Planet guide in English for me :D) and we spent the rest of that night reading over the guides together which was quite fun... I am sooooo pumped about our Summer Holiday!!!  Denmark played sweden in the football (soccer for all you non-europeans). If both teams got 2 goals, then Italy would be out of the compitition which is what all us scandinavians wanted... Denmark led for most of the match, but the final score was 2-2, perfect! Ciao Italiano! Next match Denmark plays is against Czech...  Aargh, I can't believe just how fast the past 6 months have gone... its so crazy, and they say that the last 6 months goes the fastest... so before you all know it I will be home again.  ...oh and by the way I think you can register as a member of my site here, so if you figure out how to do that, I would be much obliged!   Cheerio!  Kaz
