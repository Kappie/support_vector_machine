Its actually very eerie, if yew ask me.. Maybe its because its like 4 in the morning and im sitting her watching it in the dark, but it reminds me of 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou' in the KKK scene. Hmmm i suppose its a fairly good song with me not being a country fan and all. Anywho.. that's all i had to say.
