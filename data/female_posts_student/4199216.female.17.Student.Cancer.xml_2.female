Well, my lazy behind sat down and watched TV until noon, and then I realized that I needed to get ready! So, I got ready, and when I got to the theatre, I was given my assignment and I was ready to get to work! Well, I needed some help so I asked Stephanie to help me decorate the call board, and then eventually Christan joined me! Well, my intention was to get some work done, but by the time the three hours were up, I had only accomplished decorating 2 out of 10 call boards. I got a list of what will go on the call board, and I also began working on the idea of Big Sis/Bro and Lil' Sis/Bro. I was disappointed because I knew that something would just have had to come up in. And guess what?!?!?! It did! I now have to work on Friday, which only leaves me tomorrow to decorate the other 8 call boards (cutting fabric, finding borders to match, finding letters that match), fininish the Big Sis stuff, set up my desk at school, and much MUCH more! I am now in a panic frenzy, because I just completed the very first newsletter for the school year, and somehow I have to bring it to school tomorrow, but I don't have any ink! Well, we shall see how that'll work out! I don't know what I am going to do beacuse the scheduled time to work tomorrow is from 1-4, and I need to stay longer, but not too much longer because I am going to the hair dresser tomorrow, and I need to get my college transcript! GEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZ! School hasn't begun yet and I am already getting stressed!
