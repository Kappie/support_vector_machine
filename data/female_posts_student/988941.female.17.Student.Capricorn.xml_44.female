Good luck with it anyway :) I hear what you are saying about the prom thing. I mean pople need to book limos now because they will be gone by the time it comes around and I guess it same with the dresses, its best to get them early. I think everyone has just been in a leavers ball mood this week! I guess the phase will pass but it is someting nice to look forward to.
