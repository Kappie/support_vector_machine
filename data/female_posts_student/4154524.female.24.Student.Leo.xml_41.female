I call the creepy one Fatboy 2-changed the order in which the toothbrushes hung on the tray... 3-thought about changing the lightbulb in the kitchen but later decided that if it was dark then i wouldn't have to do the dishes.... 4-stared at the cat and found out that cats too have facial expressions... 5-made balloon animals which confused me so i made hats instead 6-went to my roomates room and mismatched all her neatly sorted socks
