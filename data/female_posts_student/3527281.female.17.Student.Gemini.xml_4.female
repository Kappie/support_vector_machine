Nothing exciting to say except that I kinda miss it... and I feel like kind of a nerd for writing on this but I am DARNED PROUD to be a Falcon. Remember? Once a falcon, always a falcon. All of you current falcons... seriously consider becoming a beaver. It's like a bigger, better Hillsdale... just drug-, clique-, and marching band-free. I know, I know, it's hard to imagine, but w/e... I guess that's all I have to say?! I'm just proud to be here! WOO!
