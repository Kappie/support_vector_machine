Last summer I was in Seattle, just on the streets. Can you believe that? Well that’s what life was showing me, life is bigger then us you know. And I’d sit and watch these people everyday, the same people walking by to work or where ever, and they didn’t change. So I was thinking about it all; the people and life, and life doesn’t want that for people. They are being held back man, held by the  chains that bind . And one by one I saw each link in the chain... Obesity, carbon dioxide, the machines... it’s a chain man, it comes full circle.  Machines  man; the alarms clocks, the stop lights, the light bulbs, the cars, the mechanical pencils. It’s all a cycle. Why don’t people ever think about it? Because they’re trapped. 	 They drive their cars to the McDonald’s. Over and over, until they can’t walk. They try to exercise but they can’t man, it’s the air pollution from those damn machines. They can’t breath enough to run. Ever try jogging in LA? I walked from LA to Reno once, I know all about walking. So it gets worse and worse, and more machines come to solve the problems.  No . I know the world needs a change, I have the answer. You in a hurry? Right.  ...   I spent two weeks conflicted. I knew what was wrong, but what could I do about it? I started walking one day, and I was walking down to the pier- it happened. The next piece of the puzzle, life gave it right to me. This bike was coming up the hill towards me, and the chain broke. The chain broke man, and the bike stopped working. Think about it. I watched the guy fix it, it was one link. So you see where I’m going? We only gotta break one link in the cycle, and the rest falls apart. The  cycle , man! Isn’t life amazing? 	 Where you going? Don’t worry, I’m not busy today. I’ll just tell you on the way. From that point on it came together. It was only a matter of which chain link to break. We can’t break carbon dioxide until we break the machines, because the pollution chokes the trees so the earth can’t filter it. But the people are blinded, they want the machines. They need their eyes opened to what the machines are doing to them. I’m attacking obesity.  	 Around this time I decided I should share my discovery, and this is where the story gets strange. I rode the bus to Seattle Pacific. I knew the best place to start was to inform the elite of society, people who have reputation. They could write books, like what happened with El Nino. I talked to those fucktard professors and their campus security for hours. Can you believe they didn’t get it? An establishment of education and they’ve been missing this the whole time. I told them, I was just the messenger from life. Fucktards. I’ve read more books then anyone I know, and they ignored me like I was crazy! I’ve never seen one of them in Barnes and Nobles in their fuckity little ties. You ever met those kind of people? Yeah. You’re an alright guy, you know that? Alright. The story.  	 I knew from that point on that I was on my own, with no help from the society I’m giving my life to. I had a problem: How to make the masses know, to understand. That’s where this money comes in man, I’m getting to it. Are we taking this bus? Don’t worry about it, I can handle it. 	 Anyway. My buddy Ralph has this epiphany, he says to me “Woodrose, what do people need with every meal. What is there at every meal.” I knew it. Napkins! We need to mark the napkins! Of course we couldn’t do it manually, you gotta approach this stuff scientifically. What we need is to hit the napkins at the source, in the factory. Weston  Son’s is the largest paper merchant on the west coast, I did research. It seems simple enough- I just need to control that factory for... maybe two days, it will be on napkins everywhere. The plan. For once I’ll be getting the better of the machines. See, this is how it works: People read the napkins, and realize what’s wrong. But also on the napkins is a proposal, which most people will take, because it’s common sense.   Whatever money they used to spend on fast food will be sent to my Brake the Chain foundation. The Napkins are just the beginning. Once the book is written, I can get on Oprah’s booklist. I know how this country works. If I can get on Oprah, I’ll gain the support of every woman. So maybe I do some late night shows, you know, the spokesperson thing- until the foundation reaches 8 billion dollars. It won’t take long, McDonald’s annual revenue by itself is 12.5 billion. We’ll be sucking money from fast food places all over the country. Man how far are you riding this bus to? Well, we should have plenty of time. 	 Okay. Now when I said I have a scientific mind, I mean that in more ways then one. Obviously, it takes a certain kind of person to draw all these connections, and have the ambition to carry all this stuff out. It also takes someone with social connections as well, and I have those. I’ve lived in all the major cities at one point or another. Now stage two of my plan, people have told me it’s odd- but let me ask you this: when Columbo was kneeling before the Queen of Peru, do you think he gave a damn about what the court thought of him? With their whispers? No. He had one thing on his mind, America, and  Democracy .   Freedom  , man. He was a freedom fighter, and so am I. I would have be a lunatic to think I could change the entire world. Possibly the US, but not the entire world. So the real question is; these followers, how do I protect them from the machines? How do I save this sect of true humanity? We must start anew. From the ground up. I’ll explain. 	 By now we have 8 billion, more then enough to catch the attention of John Carmack. You know who he is? The infamous programmer behind Doom and the Quake series. I happen to know he’s been taking an interest in space travel recently, he has his own team in that X-Plane competition. We hire Id Software to design for us a ship, large enough to fit my followers. But here’s the difficult part. The ship has to be in the shape of me. It will make sense later on. This is a pretty tough assignment for just Id Software, but going back to the social connections, you won’t believe who I met in Tacoma, outside of a bar of all places. A guy named Ross, used to be an animator for the Transformers, that show. So I’ll get him to do the advising to Carmack, since Ross is more of a conceptual visionary. 	 When you’re a leader type, you gotta be thinking about the people. That’s why I know I have to provide for them, they need a direction after giving up the fast food. That’s why 2 billion of the foundation will be used to form “Woodrose’s”, an all natural health food store. The company policy will be: if you drove there, you cannot come inside. So here’s a place they can go to eat, and it will keep them walking at the same time. All profits will go towards the construction of our ship. We getting off here? Right, I should finish. 	 With that added income, it shouldn’t take long before we’re all on our way to Mars. The ship will land vertically, serving as a 10,000 scale statue around which we’ll build our new society. Now this is where it gets philosophical. By this time we’ve definitely broken the chain, but you have to ask yourself how long do we have until those same chains come back... it’s people man, it’s people who bind themselves. This is some heavy shit we’re talking about here. So how do we escape the chains that bind? We become the chains. If we weren’t people, we could not be bound. I’m no fool, you cannot live on Mars without the aid of machines. You just can’t escape them any other way then to join them. My consciousness will be transferred into my mechanical statue, where I will help them construct my giant robotic wife. Once we’re done building her, its only a matter of us populating Mars with our own race of Decepticon children. 	 The only problem with this plan is, I gotta make a phone call, and I don’t got the change. I gotta call a guy named Floyd Holland, he works night shift for Weston and Son’s based out of Spokane. Once he hears my plan, he’ll be my contact in the company, and that’s the first step man. So you have to decide, are you going to help humanity, or what?   Hello?
