I love Westlake UMC, as I have been going there pretty much since my birth, but I feel that I need something more--namely, a more Scripture-focused worship service.  I glanced at the book on my coffee table, Grace for the Moment by Max Lucado.  I randomly flipped through and stopped at 2 particular pages, with 2 similar, yet different messages.  Coincidentally enough, they were exactly what God wanted me to hear--as their subject matter has been a stumbling block for me lately.  1.  Faith Meets Grace   Let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith, because we have been made free from a guilty conscience...-Hebrews 10: 22   Faith is not born at the negotiating table where we barter our gifts in exchange for God's goodness.  Faith is not an award given to the most learned.  It's not a prize given to the most disciplined.  It's not a title bequeathed to the most religious.  Faith is a desperate dive off the sinking boat of human effort and a prayer that God will be there to pull us out of the water.  The apostle Paul wrote about this kind of faith:   "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast." (Eph. 2:8-9)   The supreme force in salvation is God's grace.  2.  Itemized Grace   The Lord knows those who belong to Him.--2 Timothy 2:19   Imagine the event.  You are before the judgement seat of Christ.  The book is opened and the reading begins--each sin, each deceit, each occasion of destruction and greed.  But as soon as the infraction is read, grace is proclaimed...  The result?  God's merciful verdict will echo through the universe.  For the first time in history, we will understand the depth of his goodness.  Itemized grace.  Catalogued kindness.  Registered forgiveness.  We will stand in awe as one sin after another is proclaimed, and then pardoned...  The devil will shrink back in defeat.  The angels will step forward in awe.  And we saints well stand tall in God's grace.  As we see how much he has forgiven us, we will see how much he loves us.  And we will worship him.  The result will be the first genuine community of forgiven people.  Only one is worthy of the applause of heaven, and he's the one with the pierced hands and feet.  ~~~~~  After reading that, I cried for about 10 minutes.
