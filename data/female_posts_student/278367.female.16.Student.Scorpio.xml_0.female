The main character, Emma, leaves no reminiscences of Becky of the  Shopaholic  books.  Also told in the first person, this book is hilarious and kept me laughing through and through.  (The truth is, I picked up the book to read a little bit and never put it down.  By the time I finished, it was morning and I never even realized how late, or early rather, it was)  On its own, I really enjoyed the book, although slightly far fetched.  Emma has a pretty okay life.  She works as an advertising assistant, has a great, adoring boyfriend, and has a genius for a best friend.  However, she has a few secrets, like all of us do.  One of them happens to be a fear of flying.  Upon returning from a failed business meeting which might have given her the promotion she had been looking for, her flight hits some major turbulence and people are being bumped and scratched and thrown upward.  In a complete panic, Emma turns to the man next to her and blurts out every secret she could ever have.  She doesn't even finish by the time a flight attendant tells her they've landed.  Emma realizes a few things--she doesn't feel really loved by her parents, she's not in love with her boyfriend.  Emma tries to go on like the whole thing never happened, but then finds out that the man she told all her secrets to...well, he founded the company she works at and he's come to visit the company.  And to top it off, this man remembers each and every one of Emma's secrets.  Romance, hilarity, and drama ensues.  So much happens, that that small summary barely does the story justice.  The only thing I thought might have been missing was character development.  In Kinsella's  Shopaholic  books, you felt you knew each of the characters, but in  Secret , each character is a little less, how shall I say..."revealed" to the reader.  Nonetheless, I loved the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh.
