I got out of the bed at 12:30 and I came downstairs and got on the computer.  I checked my mail and saw who all was on and stuff.  After that I went swimming for a little while just to relax all by my damn self a little bit.  After that I came in and helped mom clean out christa's room for a little while.  It sucked really bad. After about 2 hours of cleaning, I got on the computer again to check the air force academy website for picture's of chris again.  The other night me and mom got on it at like 12 something and looked through 4 days of pictures....It took up 3 and a half hours!  We found 2 of her on the day of in-processing.  She looked pissed at the world, which is how she's supposed to look.  We got a letter from her yesterday and it sounds like she's doing ok.  The altitude is really messing her up and since she's a vegetarian, she doesn't get to eat much.  She said in the letter that her meals consist of cold rice and veggies at everymeal.  They get 10 minutes to eat and in that time they have to say all this stuff before they can eat so its not actually 10 minutes! I miss her.  Anyway, after I looked for somemore pictures of her, I decided to write her a letter.  That took like an hour and then I decorated the envelop all pretty and stuff.... After that mom decided we needed to go to wal*mart, but we both needed showers so, I got a shower, then mom got one, and we got ready and went to wally.  I saw drew going in and then I saw jess at the 4-way stop thing....Christina was with her....:( *sigh* anyway, we got home at like 7:30 and me and momma are cooking steaks for dad.  He had to work today and he's supposed to be home at around 8.  Hopefully I'll get to go out tonight but I'm not gonna be mad if I dont b/c I know askin to do something is pushing it.  I'll keep those who care posted...  Well, we had steaks and potatoes.  They were really good.  Me and dad bitched at mom b/c she bought the crappy potatoes lol...it was funny.  I made pecan brownies for daddy.  They were good but not as good as usual b/c mom bought the cheap brand...:(  I cleaned up my room and everything and I asked dad if I could spend the night with Jana and he said no, then I went to can I go out and he STILL said no.  He says that he's sorry that I cant do anything, but he wants to prove to me that its not ok to be a smart ass to mom...I see his point, but 2 weeks sucks ass! Oh well, one more week, then Im gonna party hard and get grounded again.  Fuck it man, Fuck it
