He came around 8 and took me to his house where we made french toast. Pretty good french toast, but clearly because i helped :P hehe not really.       So i got home around 8:30 and because some people messed around with our already planned itinerary ( yes, we had a TYPED itinerary that we were supposed to follow) instead of meeting at ann morrison park at 9 i was told to show up around 10. So i sat around for awhile with nothing to do, and then went over to get staci to head to the park. After a fun hour of frisbee golf with everyone( reminder to self: talk friends into playing frisbee golf in the summer, its actually really fun) Staci and i had to head off to get our hair done. After 89 bobbypins were placed in my hair( yes, matt and i actually counted the amount of bobbypins in my hair when we took it out) I dropped staci buns off so we could do our makeup.     I put on my dress, did some "smokey eyes" makeup and waited around for matt to show up. He borrowed a mercedes for the night(!) and pulled up in that around 4. WAY excellent, man can that baby excellerate. So then we had to go to demeyer park for group pictures and parents. It was sooooo damn windy and everyone wanted to take like 4 MILLION pics...we spent way to much time there. Anyways so after that we headed for The Big Easy to take early pictures at 5. After we got everybodys pictures taken we went to  The Cottonwood Grill downtown...that is SUCH a nice resteraunt....half of our group ordered 25 dollar plates...mega expensive but excellent. I met a girl in the bathroom with my same dress, it was expected that i would see a few girls with it. Calie and I sat at dinner and whenever girls would walk by we would point out which of their dresses we tried on.      After dinner (around 7:30) we FINALLY showed up for the dance. It was awesome, especially since i wore flip flops instead of heels (so nice). I saw Genie and seifs right as i walked in the door. Genie looked soooo pretty and Ian looked great as well. The Big Easy smelled like its usual smoke alcohol and drugs but otherwise it looked good. So Matt and i danced with Genie and Ian and the rest of our group forevs which was crazy fun. Genie and Ian were hilarious to watch, and despite what genie says shes an awesome dancer. At one point in the night we joined a congaline and randomly they decided to break it off right in front of me so i had to be the front. It was fun! i barreled in and out of crazy people grinding and broke it up. they were pissed, it was excellent.    I saw makenzie and Lindsay and the other Lindsay randomly throughout the night too. LIndsay Andrysiak looked so pretty, damn her for being so pretty. Makenzie looked great as well, but Todd looked SOO cute and seeing the two of them slowdancing together put a smile on my face. Makenz refused to dance with me though because she didnt want to look stupid in front of Todd. I danced and looked stupid in front of everyone.     Best part of the night though was Seifs and Bains coming and dancing with Genie Lindsay and I. Seifs doing Genies signature move was the funniest thing I've ever seen,EVER. He's my favs. Grizz was there randomly too. Genie and I also ran into Alex and we think he was seriously drunk. He was way to happy and disoriented.     Anyways.    I won't bore you with any more petty details, the fact of the matter is I love dancing and it was a blast. I told Genie we should come back to the Big Easy on all ages nights and go dancing. She agreed that would be excellent.     After the dance Matt drove me home in the mercedes. When we rounded the corner on mcmillian i rolled down the skylight and stood up through it. It was such a rush, having the wind rushing past me in the car.     I packed my camping gear after matt dropped me off and waited for him to return for me. We rode up to the campsite with Chris and Staci. I was exhausted by this time and slept the entire way up. By the time we got up there I knew it wasn't going to be a very fun night... to be continued, i have to go make myself decent for dinner.
