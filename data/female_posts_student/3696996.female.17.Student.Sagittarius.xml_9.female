There's so much to do there and I can get a chance to do some badly needed work on my   relationship with God. I just went back to church this week for the first time in 2 months. The   1st month I was doing sunday school and the second month so much crap came up every sunday   like no one in my family went...theres no excuse tho! I feel wicked bad and like I haven't been   fed spiritually at all which is completely my fault. Hopefully this week atYL camp will help. I   also haven't been to my guitar lesson since the week b4 Quebec which was the beginning   of   June. I'm a retard...I have been working on stuff with my guitar, tho. I'm working on Moonlight   Sonata and I've written 2 guitar parts off of a tab I found online, IT IS THE AWESOMEST   THING EVER! I'm so excited about it. I still haven't decided if I should write words for it.    Probably not, it'll be fine the way it is and words would probably cheapen it.
