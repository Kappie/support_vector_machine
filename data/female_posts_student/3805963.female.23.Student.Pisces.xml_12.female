Let me go into detail on what brought me to this addictive entertaining game.  For those that do not know, Everquest is a online game, a game you play with multiple people from all over the internet. It carries a monthly fee of $12.95. It is a roleplaying game, or a game where you play as someone potentially different than yourself acheiving goals to progress the game story as a whole. There is no clear way to "win", you make the decision as to whether you are winning in terms of how satisfied you are with each play session.  I had at one point in time told myself I would never pay money to buy a game, then pay money to play it per month. I decided that this was a waste of money because there are plenty of free games to play online, where all you pay for is the original software. This attitude changed however because of a friend of mine.  This friend is one of my old buddies from when I was in the military. we used to gather weekly for Dungeons and Dragons which I ran, and he was a really cool individual. He is a Air Traffic Controller for the Air Force. Well eventually he got called to duty in Iraq maintaining the bagdad air field. He was gone for many months, and every month he was there I worried about his welfare.   Eventually he did come home, and he let me know that he was back. I was excited to see him again! First night he returned and was settled in enough he came by, while SammyCaine was with her dad wasting his money away at the casinos in Iowa. He brought his computer as we figured we might hook up to my internet service, and play some games or something. When he arrived, he brought Everquest with him, the Planes of Power Disc to be specific. He had told me at that time that if I wanted I could install it and play with him on it and that it was free for the first month, and if I didn't like it I could give him back the discs and the account and he'd give it to another person. Since there was apparently no risk to this scenario, I decided what the heck, I would find out what all the hype was about.  I installed Everquest, patch took 20 minutes or so, while it was doing that we played a little hockey on my Playstation 2. Then we eventually got my account setup. We both decided to play new characters(as he was a long time player of the game) on the server he specified. That night I setup a human Monk(melee class style of play) and he setup a human Wizard, and we started in the same city. it went okay first night, we played a bit had a decent time trying to kill things we should've known not to, and we got offline for the night.   The next day was a day off, I think I had a 3 day weekend, and my friend had to run errands. So bored but semi-fascinated by this game, I decided to create a new character just for myself to play on. I built a Male Dwarf Paladin named Ziggur. Paladin's seemed kind of cool, and I like dwarves, so I thought why not. played that character for a while, and noticed how much more fun this character was, not to mention I started doing quests, which are little missions that garner decent rewards in everquest. When my buddy returned for the night, he decided it would be more fun to play with my paladin than my monk, so I scrapped the monk and played the Paladin all the time while he was there.   Turns out that my friend was stationed with a guy in an Everquest guild(a group of players playing together to acheive greater goals) and he got us invited in. This dramatically improved the gameplay experience, as now I had a greater pool of people with who to talk to, who seemed really cool, and were always very helpful for a new player like myself.   Eventually my friend had to go back to the typical military grind, and eventually stopped playing everquest. I however played it for hours every night. So much so, that my fiance began to feel neglected. I had heard of EQ addiction and the effects on the home, so I always kept myself alert to this situation and corrected it everytime it popped up. But eventually I convinced her to try it(after we bought a second computer to play games together online) and she liked it, she liked it so much she bought Everquest evolutions that same night, I had already bought that plus the Lost Dungeons of Norrath to open up all the spots on the Everquest map for me to play with. She was hooked.  Now I've made friends with a warrior and shaman in our guild, and we go out almost every night adventuring. my Dwarf just made level 40 last night and I have 7 other characters, maxing out the number of characters I can play on any given server.   I don't know what my friend is doing now, sometimes I wish he'd stayed playing so we could group together, but he's just that way. playing different MMORPG's and hopping between them as one gets stale. All I can do is thank him for giving us an experience, that my fiance and I can share, and keeps us entertained till way late at night.   Why do I play everquest? It's not the world that keeps me involved, it's the time I spend with good friends exploring that world.   Try not to feed the stupid people... Phoenix
