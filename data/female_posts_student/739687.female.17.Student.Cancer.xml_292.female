The one thing I truly hate about my life is that all I have is the  hope  for good things.  Maybe some day they will evolve into something more. Or maybe I'll just spend my life hoping that something good will come my way. And I'll stopped getting so sidetracked by people that keep wasting my time. Because then I lose sight of the people who really matter.  Most people are a giant waste of time.  I could beat them all senseless. With a large, heavy bat.  I think it would be fun.  Well...I think I'm gonna go find something actually worthy of my time. *Yes...that sounded conceited. Good. Because my time is valuable. Screw anyone that doesn't think so.*  Have a spectacular day, crazies!
