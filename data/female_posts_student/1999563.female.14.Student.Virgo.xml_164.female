I watched the first show and during the second show I read great expectations. Sadly, no contact with the sheriff. But, Sara was there! Yippee! So I just hung out at the theatre becasue they were taking pictures. I got invited to  aparty!! Haha. Elvis probably went. I didn't go because I thought Matt and I were going to clean but we ended up not cleaning. How annoying.  Right when I got home I went to my room and just cried because...I dunno. I guess I was sad. While I was laying on my pillow I guess I felll asleep. I just woke up. Haha.  Today was a dull day.  Love, Laura
