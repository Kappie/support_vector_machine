My position was water girl, I was simply to take the water bottles to the third mile...... Wat sounded so simple, turned out to be a nightmare. It seems like I drove around looking for a way into this trail forever! I asked like 5 people and everyone talked about how shitty stans map was... You couldn't even make out the words. So I call Hil J Sterk, whos lazy ass was in the bed instead of running, and told her how fucking lost I was. At one point I thought about these runners at the 4th mile, dying for a drink of the water that was in my car. Then I thought how the hell am I gonna be the team manager and can't even get the team water.           SO this is when it begins.......I see this guy and ask him, he tells me to take this Lemont street to some west entrance. I'm driving down lemont and Im getting further and further away from the trail, Then I see this huge ass bridge, it looked like it sat on top of the town, with all these trees behind it.... So im thinking Im NOT getting on this bridge to nowhere lets turn around.          BIG MISTAKE.... I could only make a left turn so I did...... Only to realize I was turning into the Hindu Temple of Greater Chicago, when I read the sign my heart was pounding, I called sterk back practically screaming on the phone, and she was laughing her ass off. So I turn into the white porcelain gate and turned around, Then I saw the Temple, I was shaking, it was the weirdest thing, but i felt like I was possessed by the Hindu Spirit. I turned out the gate and hauled ass back to the trail! The temple scared the Fuck out of me.
