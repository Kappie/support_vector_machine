"bu dao huang he....." ?? i honestly do not know what it means and neither have i heard of it. =X this reminds me, i should set a new target for chinese. =)  B3 . kkies yaa.. settled!   While waiting for my turn durin oral i sms-ed  gabriel  (fengrui) ask whether he wanna watch movie then he str8 away replied and said ok and asked for the venue and all tt. but after oral he totally became sooper wishy washy.. * tsk tsk  he couldn't make up his mind where to go. but in the end we went.  jiax , him and i took bus no. 7 to town. we decided to go to PS to catch the 12.35pm show. (i was forced to watch  JU-ON  by jiax!) but gab left we 2 poor girls to watch the horror flick after he received a phone call from his friends. he's sucha meanie k. so jiax and i caught the 12.10pm show. i think lotsa' ppl mistook us for  lesbos  cos' we were practically hugging each other in the theatre! =\ if u see us from behind you might think tt we were making out and humping each other! haaha.. then we took the popcorn box and chips wrapper to cover our faces (eyes to be exact) and were the only ones screaming. so not fun k! the movie was quite alright lar.. scary as in.. a lot of scenes where the ghost (whatever) suddenly appear tt type.. typical jap horror flick. it's not a 'must watch' though. if you have lotsa' cash in your pocket and ure bored on a hot afternoon then you might wanna see it..   Rushed back to clementi for shooting practice.. * phew *  sadiq  and i were late together haha so we walked to skl to meet them. =) poor  pinky  she waited for about 45 mins for us! =\ and she was soo beat from all the drills. heard from her tt some timings change oredi... after the prac,  mashafiz ,  nat  and i wenta' the mall to walk walk. we went to harvey norman then being the dork tt i am, i began playing on the electronic organ (damn cool) then mas was soooper funny make us laugh until stomache! =X they had more than 100 songs installed in the organ loh. so cool.. we bluffed this cute little girl.. we just anyhow banged on the organ and she actually tot we were playing the actual thing. it was so easy for us. hahaaa so mega lame i tell ya! =b   Kkies gotta eat dinner now.. i'm expecting a visitor later. btw, i saw  jingping  on telly! channel news asia. this afternoon at the hee-uge screen in the mall. coooolies. haha. called her lil' bro and told him.. then he was like " huh she on tv!!!? really?
