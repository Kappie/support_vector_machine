And she asked me why I was so smiley.  And I didn't have an answer, but as I thought of it, I realized that I was indeed in a good mood.  It wasn't something that had occurred to me straight away, though, that I was in a good mood.  But when my attention was called to it, I realized that I was.  I was happy, and smiling.  And I started to wonder why.  And though I could think of many reasons, e.g. getting the internet set up at home, the wonderful book I am reading, the fact that I'd just seen a good movie the day before...none of these reasons seemed particularly satisfactory.  I guess it's just as hard for me to figure out why I'm in a good mood as it is to figure out why I'm in a bad mood.    And I guess that's the way it should be.
