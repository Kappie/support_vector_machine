I'm scared that Jon may like other girls but I don't want to think that...I mean he tells me he loves me and I know that I love him its just hes the only guy that I've ever gotten this close to other wise I keep my distince with ppl I'm scared that once they get to know me they won't like me but I think Jon really cares but it worries me that he can talk to Liz better than he dcan talk to me...he still has Sarha's picture on his dresser and all the notes that Ashley wrote him...He didn't keep any of mine that I wrote him and they all basically told him how much i cared I don't understand what runs through his head and I'm scared that I'm going to get hurt. I told Jon tonight that it might start to get alittle hard between me and him...moms a bitch...and he asked if I wanted to break up with him I told him never which was the truth...I don't want to ever be with out him I think I really could marry Jon and be with him for the rest of my life but hey he always says he doesn't care about anything and sometimes that makes me wonder if he cares about me or not...well on to sumtin good...tonight I'm going to put a chater of my book in...  ~Dana~
