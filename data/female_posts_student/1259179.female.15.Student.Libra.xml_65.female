She is emotional, loving, fun, so caring, so amazing, such a young lady too and so much more...  I am really amazed that 9 years has already gone by.  She will be getting her Pyjama Party in February because of her sister not feeling so hot.  She totally is OK with all this.  We still made a little birthday celebration with our friends the neighbor's.  Anyways, it is Sunday so...........Be Good
