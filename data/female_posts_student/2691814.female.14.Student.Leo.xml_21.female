Anyway it started when Tim got the ashes put on him...i can't remember what religion does it either christian or catholic but Raddi started to make fun of it and tim's religion. Well from what i've been told Tim hit Raddy and now they both have ISS for a week. I think that Tim did a good thing by hitting Raddi..knock some sence into that kid my gosh. lol...I don't think its right for ppl to make fun of a religion..whatever it is. I mean..almost everyone of my friends has a different religion. for ex:..bill is wiccan, ryan is jewish, deidra's catholic. And I really can't stand how much s*** some of my friends go through,including myself, over religion,like if your not this sertain religion your not cool or you believe in satan and his being or ridiculed. It's just not right! I don't like it one bit and it just needs to stop. It's really starting to piss me off how ppl can be so stupid to make fun of what someone believes in.
