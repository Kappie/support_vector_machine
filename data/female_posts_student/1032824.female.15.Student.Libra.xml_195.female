We're going to have mass runs from now on (yipee!) and 1 period of lesson would be equivalent to an hour. Morning assemblies are on every fridays and every morning, 20 minutes is reserved for TPI(Teacher-pupil interaction) Timetable changes every 10 days (2 weeks). That part, I'm still not quite used to it, but I will soon.   When I was younger, just like Lynette, I didn't like changes. But you know,  "everthing's changing, when I turn around, all out of my control, I'm a mobile"  (extracted from Avril's "Mobile"). My parents are always telling me that it is essential to adapt to our surroundings. It's like what Mr Lau would always tell us, "Survival of the fittest". So yupp, it's just a matter of getting used to it. I think mass runs would be really fun. You see, the school is so tiny, and there are 10 classes in Sec 4. I think we might just end up brisk walking due to the crampness. Teehee.   Our new class parent is Mdm Liu Jian, co-class parent is Mrs Raja. Quite alright, Ruth and I kinda miss Mrs Tan. But I think Mdm Liu and Mrs Raja will be quite 'on'. They are really supportive.  That's all for today! Take care folks!
