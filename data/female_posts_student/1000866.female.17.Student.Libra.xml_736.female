It's one of my favorite movies but it always depresses me SO much. Depresses, but at the same time sort of inspires. It's so ironic that the one person who tries and tries to do good for the world, ends up dead.   That's what makes me sad. It makes me think of how crappy the good people in this world are treated. If you want to get ahead in life, basically you have to be an ass. I mean, look at all the CEO's of big companies. It really depresses me sometimes. It's funny. Most of the time you watch those movies and are determined to do good (yes, I do realize the improper grammar) and you think that way for a bit but it slowly tapers off. I think I need to make like...a little sign that just says, "Pay It Forward." Then, maybe, I'll remember and keep the determination to do something nice for somebody.   Anyway, I'm tired and, kind of sad, so I guess I'll go sleep. Maybe I'll read more of Pride and Prejudice first. I actually love the book so far. I think I'll be the only one at the book club on Monday who enjoyed the book. Heh.   Much love.
