Haha, it was funny at break, we kept saying to Jon that he's sexist but he kept saying 'No no,' hehe, we really pissed him off! (Fun!) In a way I guess... then at lunch (which the orchestra peeps missed) we were doing dumb stuff, we were trying to get Emma to kiss some one but she wouldn't (wonder why) ooh and I found out that Mike is now going out with no one and Debbie is with Dan. (Make any sense) Not really!  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/021113/143/deivo.html  Aww how depressing! Oh, Look Around You isn't on this week! *sob sob* But HIGNFY is! Yeay! Oh noo I missed Neighbours again, and it was funny yesterday apparantly, Drew died! But he died, and was buried in the same episode! Weird aye? And the whole street flew to Okey! Hehe, stupid or what? *imagines... Oh yeah, place Harold's house over there by the tree* (Like they're actually moving the street you know...?) Why do I bother? I'm just a bit far out of normal brain wave range. *brain wave? is that even a real thing* For me? No. For other people? Who knows? Err I'm gonna go, sorry for the freak talk!
