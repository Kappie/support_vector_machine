Sorry Will, my mom has the booklet with the address in it but you've been yelling at me for getting it out. Oh yea, last nite was extremely strange...why did you start it?  Rosie Jiang (duh!) Governor's School for the Sciences Hume Hall 1911 Andy Holt Ave. Knoxville, TN 37996  Again that's from my memory of writing it twice about 4 days ago...so. but I'm about 70% sure that, that's absolutely correct and 98% that 80% of that is correct. Yea I know, strange.  Just whatever you two do, Don't put UT knox or Chemistry department because that will slow the mail down to about 3 wks for it to wk through the university system. Love you all... though only 2 are ready now.
