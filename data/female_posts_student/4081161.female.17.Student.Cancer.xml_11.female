"Your body is starved," says my doctor. "You have to eat breakfast." But my doctor is cool. She's new and she's younger than the last one. She's actually pregnant and she treats me like a normal person, not a little kid who should be scolded for being sick.       No caffiene, no greasy foods, no spicy food either. Breakfast  everyday .       I am going to die.   Actually, no, I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep my pain away.       = cristie
