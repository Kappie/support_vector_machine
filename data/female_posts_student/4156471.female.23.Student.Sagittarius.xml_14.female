I"m so happy I decided to leave my room and get out cuz the night is fresh and inviting.  Makes me ache to walk and explore.  But technically I should be sleeping.  Yet,  I"m not the only one in this money computer lab that open 3 pm til 8am.  I say money cuz these compters have cd roms and I think that's a printiing station next to me.  Advil is a life saver.  Let's all cross our fingers that the infection ( which jumped across ears clandestinely) doesn't reach the painful heights of ye who I left behind a week before in Canada. I almost dread to think of how I"ll keep myself busy tommorow.  I have discoveed that there are capoeria classes in the gym across the street on Sunday.  What a good location eh? Dance and cap just across the street.  Ok, let's try this sleep thing again.
