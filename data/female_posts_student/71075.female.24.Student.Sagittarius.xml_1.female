I don't ask because I intend to write a book about it--though I used to tell people that. Rather, I ask because I want to use the real-life experiences of those who are married to create my own set of conditions (for lack of a better word) on how to make a marriage work. It's not that I have any intention of getting married either (though I've always believed--probably from social conditioning--that one way or another it'll end up happening). It's just that interpersonal relationships and the complexities of love and like have always fascinated me. And who better to ask advice from than someone who has hands-on experience? That and I'm exceedingly curious (plus the question always catches people off-guard, and it's fun to do that occasionally).  Anyway. I've asked several people about their marriages over the years and 90% say you need strong, open lines of communication. Still a slightly smaller majority claim a mutual, shared religious faith (emphasis on Christianity). Many others cite sexual compatibility and mutual appreciation as important aspects of their most intimate relationship.  So after pooling all the answers I received, I devised my own set of conditions/rules to make a marriage last. The idea being that, if a man were to propose to me, I would want to ensure that he agrees with me on these terms. To refuse any of them would be a deal-breaker because, from what I've gathered, a marriage can't possibly sustain itself without adhering to these points anyway. Assuming open communication and possibly a mutual spiritual faith as a given, these are my whittled-down cornerstones (from a strictly monogamous perspective and applicable to both parties, not just the guy):   1.) Fidelity. He must be faith ful  and have faith  in  me. If he doesn't know what faithfulness means, or tries to skim off the base definition until it has such a warped meaning that the resulting loopholes excuse any or all indiscretions, then it is my opinion that he needs a swift kick in the rear--to the curb. Clearly, he doesn't know what it means to be faithful; or worse, he doesn't care.   2.) He  must  adjust his priorities to put me first. When a person gets married, he will still be a member of his biological (or, as the case may be, adopted) family, but more importantly he will have a family of his own and so  that  family, his primary one, must take precedence and be his primary concern. His spouse's needs must be met or at least be adequately dealt with, and he must defend and stand up for her. His spouse is going to be there for him, theoretically, through thick and thin for the rest of his natural life. She deserves kudos for that and her happiness should be his top priority over and above everything else, be it a career, hobbies, habits, whatever. The only exception, IMHO, is God himself.  Furthermore, it's not unfair to put your spouse's needs before those of your children. Children eventually grow up and have lives of their own. You shouldn't cater solely to your children and neglect your spouse. You and your spouse should be a team, jointly parenting your children. You know, together. As a unit, thus completing the family unit.  3.) He must agree to respect, trust, and love me. A couple shouldn't land in divorce court if the husband goes bald or the wife gets paunchy. To love someone as unconditionally as you can lends itself naturally to respect and trust, which is why I grouped these tenets together. To trust your lover is to lack the jealousy and possessiveness that so often poisons otherwise good relationships. You can't say you love someone when all you really want to do is control him, own him, and overwhelm him with your insecurities. You can't claim to respect your lover if you degrade her, put her down, refuse to take her seriously, insult her, and so on.        I guess I feel a little indignant and prone to dredging this up every once in awhile because some of my friends have accused me of being too picky and rigid by having these standards. They say I come off like I'm a princess with unreasonable demands who's in no position to do so. And they tell me it would be unrealistic to expect a man to accept those conditions flat out--that he may, even, retract his proposal. A married friend once told me she would never have made those demands of her husband because she knew he would never accept them--he would always side with his mother over her.   My rebuttal has always been that these conditions shouldn't surprise a man who is sincerely invested in a relationship with me. His response ought to be a resounding "duh!" Indeed, I shouldn't even have to bring all this up at the point of a marriage proposal because I should already know where he stands. If a man is too spineless to accept these conditions, then he isn't mature enough to get married. And if a woman is too insecure to demand better for herself and insists on playing the "I-have-to-accept-whatever-I-can-get" card, then she doesn't deserve a quality man who will treat her the way she hopes to be treated. You can't just pick guys from the dating pool expecting them to be ready-made. The foundation for a long-lasting and fulfilling relationship has to be negotiated over time. And you have to go into a relationship knowing what you want and what you expect from him so you actually have something to bring to the table. He can't possibly make you happy if you don't know what will make you happy either.  Also,  standards  is not synonymous with  elitist.  If you don't expect a lot, you won't get a lot. It's that simple. I'm not demanding that he belong to a certain age bracket, own a particular car, act overtly romantic, or be exceedingly funny and/or smart. All those things boil down to attractiveness, which is subjective and should be squared away well before the point of discussing marriage!  You can write off everything I say because I lack personal experience in these matters, but I insist that my apparent lack of credibility shouldn't--and doesn't--dull the edge of my conclusions. No, I've never been in love. Sure, it's easy to ponder the hypotheticals of marriage when I've never had to deal with a husband who doesn't take out the trash or a wife who leaves hair in the bathtub whenever she shaves. But I think it's a worthwhile effort to talk about these issues and, by talking to others, gain a better understanding of an institution suffering from an influx of divorces  (1)  as a result of many factors ranging from "no fault" leniency  (3)  to starter marriages  (2) .   I believe marriage would have more meaning if the people so intent on getting married invested more time in it, instead of just rushing off with wild abandon to the nearest Elvis wedding chapel. If they really weighed the pros and cons of marriage, they might see that they're not as compatible with their fiance as they think, or that they're not as mature as they think they are, and can avoid the cost and heartache of divorce later on.   Or perhaps people never really were all that interested in staying married, and they never put as much effort as I'm recommending people do in choosing a partner. Maybe it was only social conditions that kept marriages going for so long in the past. After all, there were financial repercussions and social stigmatization for women who either chose to remain or become single. Now the social mores have relaxed to the point where a single, pregnant teenager barely bats an eyelash out of the establishment anymore, so by that same token, marriage is no longer such a severe and demanding occupation either. People can afford the luxury of waiting out their younger years in singledom, testing the waters and experimenting with relationships in an effort to find true happiness. This environment of freedom invites a certain degree of fickleness, however, and interpersonal laziness--there's nothing major at stake anymore so there's no reason to try to make things work. It's easier just to bow out.  Somehow the lazy tendency hasn't jived yet with people's optimistic conceptions that a lifelong marriage can still happen. It's a rude wake-up call, but I don't think their hopes will ever be met until they're willing to take the first step toward making it happen by seriously thinking about what marriage means to them and what they really want out of it. And that's what a dialogue like this is all about.
