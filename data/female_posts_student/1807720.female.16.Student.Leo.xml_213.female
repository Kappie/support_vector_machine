I like Summer School, the class structure is good - but my marks are anything but good. I found out I got a 60% on the last unit test and a 55% on the quiz. I did my best and I studied. I have done every single homework assignment assigned and have studied for each quiz and test. I am so afraid that Social 30 could affect my chances of getting into University. I hadn't been obsessing over the possibility of getting rejected for a while now, but our teacher keeps mentioning that "not everyone has the right to education" either because of financial situations or admission requirements. He told us to take a look around and realize that not everyone in the class will get accepted into University. That just made me realize the reality of it all. There is no such thing as a "hard work" mark or "effort" mark. There are only numbers to define students. I will be just another number, and just another statistic - % of people rejected/% of people accepted. I am so afraid. I know how badly I want to get in. I know how much I want to go to University. I am still going to stick through to the end of Social 30 though. I am too far now, and whatever my mark I am pretty sure I AM NOT redoing it because I need spares this year. Last year I didn't have any and that just about killed me. I just about killed myself some nights too, trying to deal with the Chem and Math. I don't want to give up on myself, it's just that marks like 69%, 60%, and 55% have me worried. I am doing all I can though. A part of me just wants to cry for some reason, I guess because I am really trying to succeed, but the I think to myself what good would that do?? I mean I like school, I am dedicated, and constantly keep up with homework and studying. There is not much more that I can do, so I guess I just have to stick it through to the end. What ever happens happens, because I seem to have very little control over my mark at the moment. Everything always works out in the end one way or another, so I suppose this is no different.   Well, ok so that is my like depressing little side to me right now, but I did just come back from Stampede. I went to watch the hypnotist twice, and ate A LOT of food. I had some ice cream, cheese burger and fries, Stompin' Strawberry drink from Jugo Juice, half of a lemonade drink and half of a strawberry fruit shake - so good by the way. I think I am going to get another one tomorrow when we go the the Chuck Wagons and the outdoor show. I also got an amber heart pendant thing which I am going to attach my white gold chain too. anyways, I am going to some Stampede lunches and breakfasts tomorrow. I am going to Stampede again, and well Sunday I have lots of Social work to do. I just pray to God that no matter what happens, no matter what mark I end up with in Social 3o, just PLEASE make sure I get into University. I want to get in...and I deserve it. Just thinking about rejection upsets me, and I can't handle being upset!!! God, I pray to you. Please.
