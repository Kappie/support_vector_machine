Who have I got? nobody.   And then magically, as if somebody had heard her cry, somebody came and sat next to her. "Hey," says he. Malpreet doesn't realise he's talking to her. "I'm Tom," he says, and Malpreet looks up. "What?" she says, defeaned by the noise. "I'm Tom," he yells. "Oh, hi Dom," she says. "I've had 17 beers," he says proudly, grinning. Malpreet smiles, with no clue of what this guy is on about. Suddenly Tom falls off his chair, unconcious.  Oh my God,  thinks Malpreet. She gets off her chair, turns around and is about the run away when she walks straight into somebody.   Oh great,  she thinks. Then she sees his face.  Oh my God sexaaay!!  "Sorry," she says, and adds, "I'm Malpreet." The guy replies with something but she can't quite hear it. He repeats it and she deicdes that he is saying "Hi, I'm Alan. It's OK." "You wanna get away from the noise," yells Alan, pulling her somewhere quieter. Malpreet feel a strong urge to kiss him. She hopes Alan does too. She takes him by the hand in search of somewhere away from the rest of the partay.  Here's a room.  She opens the door find none other than Charlie and Shivani involves in some rather passionate kissing.  Woops.  And immediately shuts the door.  The next door along is the Ladies.  This'll do. nobody comes in here anyway.  And in they go.
