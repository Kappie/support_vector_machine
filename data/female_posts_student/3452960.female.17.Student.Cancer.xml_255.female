Invent new ways of dancing. Turning ordinary tasks into robot style dances are tremendous fun (I draw your attention to microwaving things, or eating noodles)  2. Construct elaborate buildings using only matchsticks/toothpicks/lollysticks or a combination of all of those.  3. Write bizarre poetry involving some sort of action hero, fighting hard against the opressive dictators of the world in a desperate attempt to liberate his wife from their vile clutches and once more keep the world safe from the foul, corrupt, communistic government of the nazi-commie-fascist rulers.  4. Compose the greatest song in the world.  5. Write obscure lists.  6. Rip-off the same "Write obscure lists" gag that has been used in almost every single 'things to do when you are bored' list ever contrived.  7. Make an "obscure list" post your own by making a joke about how it's been done before.  8. Cook fish.  9. Try very hard to fill in 10 points of "Things To Do When You Are Very, Very Bored" lists.  10. Shutup.
