I mean...if anything happens it's prolly gonna happen whether I like it or not...I will be sad if something does that I don't want to happen...but I can't stop him. He wants to go on this road trip so bad...and I dont' want to stand in his way. That would just be selfish of me. I only hope that he'll come back and still love me...or love me more. (In the essence of that whole  Distance makes the heart grow fonder  type of thing...o.O ^^)  Anyways...I dunno. Emmy is feeling better...yay! *dances* I just wish that Sunny would come back...but I do have to say I don't really miss her extreme hyperness all that much. I've been so sick lately that I don't think I'd want to have to deal with it. I still miss talking to her though...  But yeah...I've been so sick lately..my throat is just starting to get better..but my voice is all fucked up and my head feels like it's gonna split open...ow...hopefully that'll go away soon. But I won't be able to get lunch today...;.; I'm all out of lunch money and I still don't have my ID card with me...cuz I think it went through the wash...or something...I dunno.  Blah..that's the only real news I have...Henry's and Jeremie's birthdays are on Friday...so I'm gonna have to buy them something on Saturday cuz I get my paycheck on Friday...and I won't be able to go to the bank until Saturday morning sometime. Then I just gotta get to the mall...o.O lol. But I do plan on getting a Gameboy Advance SP or w/e the hell it's called...lol. and Fire Emblem..cuz that game is really damn addicting. ^^; yes, I'm pathetic. lol.  And...thats it. Yup..that's all the news I have at the moment. So...I'm gonna stop wasting your time now. Baiobaio! ^^ :wave:
