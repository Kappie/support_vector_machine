Well i went to Croydon today, the main reason was cause my sister forgot to take the photo chip with her to wokr this morning, so i went in and gave it to her. The most surprising thing was that she then payed for my bus fairs and ALSO brought me lunch !!! I then went on to buy myself some nice shorts for which i am wearing now and a top, which on the back has written: kik my arse, or something to that effect. I have also sunbathed today although not for too long as it was a bit too hot unless it weent hazy! Ne way enough said by mee, until the next time i blog...
