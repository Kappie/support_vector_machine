Sorry, Denis Leary segment there.  However, y'all should be prepared, because my memory is hopefully flowing into overtime and I am going to convey a portrait of my weekend for y'all. My away message is up and I am ready to type!   Friday, woke up around 9:30am so that was not too bad. A nice change of pace. Then I was left with the duty of entertaining myself for about four and a half hours. I got dressed and ready, chilled with my brother, and cleaned a bit. I had gone through my checklist to ensure I would not forget anything of massive importance for the weekend. I knew I needed a change of clothing including my team shirt, dream catcher, and money ($160 from my mom the night before) - none of which I forgot. I was all set and ready. Just needed to wait for my ride to be out of work at noon and set out at about 1:30/2pm. Well, he had gotten out of work early and decided to meet me at about 12:30pm instead. No complaints. We set out and were well on out way by 1pm. He ended up taking a route that I was unfamiliar with, but whatever. My concern was simply that we had gotten there, which we did. I ended up showing him around the campus and telling him things I learned at WPI. Saw a PA from Frontiers and thought I would find Tych through him. Instead he chilled with us as I sat at my regular bench.   Tych was spotted coming in and I guess that it is a good thing that I decided against running to him.  I just stayed on my bench basically in shock out of happiness. We sat around and talked for a little while, a bit of frisbee, which led into more frisbee on the quad which was enjoyable. Matt met another soon-to-be PA for Frontiers.   More sitting on the bench trying to decide what to do. I finally decided that I felt like playing pool, so Tych taught us Cutthroat (spelling?) which was a pretty nifty game. I really had no focus and could not remember a damned thing that was going on lol. That was pretty bad. I did horribly, but whatever. I knew I would. I one once. The soap opera that was on was pretty disturbing too. I can definitely do such a better job than that.  Well, after was more confusion of what to do. I think this is where we walked to Claudio's so we would know where it was then Tych was inclined to show we the "Most Magicalist Place in the Land" aka Price Chopper because I had never been there. Then we decided to walk up a huge hill. That was not too bad, my legs are feeling it which is good. The view on top was awesome. Then we went back to campus center for air conditioning. In the campus center we went on computers to check on the Sole Proprietor (again, spelling?) and I ended up showing Tych an e-mail I saved which got a bit of redness. Tehe. Then I think that was where we decided to drop Matt's stuff off and I manage to cut myself on the porch. Go me! Anyways, this led into walking back to competition and watch a bit before deciding to split up for the evening. I stayed with Tych and then came more bench sitting. Some cool stuff happened there but a perverted station wagon-y type vehicle was not helping...so we went over to the dorms and chilled by some lockers. That was nice. Minus the guy charging up and down the wall way with an umbrella, which was pretty funny. Missed reservations at Sole P. so decided to grab something quick at Ernie's, which has really good pizza, before going back to Claudio's. We had to beat him back because we had his keys. Got there and met John (right?) and then Claudio got back a short time later. Had a good discussion about academics. Shed a bit of a new light for me. If you go to college for something that you are already good at, then great. But if you go for something that you need to work at a little more, and you do work on it, then you learn that also become more well-rounded. Good thought, eh? We ended up watching this ridiculous "Kids in the Hall" or something like that DVD. It was er...interesting. What was so great was being able to be next to Matt and getting to fall asleep next to him :-D  Then I was spoiled.   The competition started at about 9am I guess, but as seeing that we did not actually got to sleep before about 5:30am, we over-slept that. Until about 11/11:30am. We made it to competition with plenty of time. We watched a few rounds and otherwise rotated between outside and campus center. We just sat, talked, and were close. Dancing at the competition was great too, I really enjoyed that. I also saw and got to talk to a lot of old friends such as Saul, can't remember his name, JJ, Rob, and Ashley.   Our team did the usual, make it to finals - crap out. All good.   Walking away from Tycho again at the end of the day was once more the hardest things I ever had to do. It hurt so much. I wanted to look back, but knew if I did that I would be inclined to run back. I miss you.  The trip the way back, I was so random. I kept singing "Buttercup", "Soul Man", and then I oddly enough really wanted either a hot stuffed pretzel or baked potato. I ended up getting the potato lol.  Bowling with Jennie, Mark, and Kristen. Fun stuff.  Tomorrow, graduation party for Marie and another for James. Busy stuff.  There is a lot of detail that I did not yet (if I do) go into. Thank you for your time and attention. Matt, I have the dreamcatcher. I will try to get it to you ASAP.  So much not listed. Too tired. Arg.  Well, I am going to get some sleep. G'night all, take care.  Tycho, me amo ti mucho. Miss you soo much, thank you for the weekend. ::hugs:: :-*  -J9
