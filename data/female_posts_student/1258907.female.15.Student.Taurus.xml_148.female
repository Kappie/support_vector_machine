For which my love reaches an infinate degree Her skin, of porclein so sweet Yet far too frail for my rude hand to meet! Her eyes as stirring as an ocean wave To see more closely, my heart doth crave Woe it be the day our fate tis' parted A war in my soul will surely hath started For I shall die without her hand in mine I long to know such a sweet divine From the sky shall fall true loves debris Should I know not a love so free!   Diary entry 2: Act 3 Scene 3  Tis' the epitome of torture! I, Romeo, can not fathom the rigour of this atrocity! The grass may know her feet more well than I Nay, even a horses back shall know her better! A fool of a price if he, Escalus, to banish I I, Romeo! Romeo Montague! Should just as well dig a mortal wound into my heart of hearts! For banishment for Romeo means death, without thy fair Juliet!   Diary Entry 3: Act 4 Scene 1  Swear it be the day! My Juliet, with eyes as stirring as an ocean wave But now, ne're again shall I assuage what I crave Now I, Romeo, am banished in a different light To where she is, I shall ne're set my sight For tonight, as the moon shall rise The dagger shall bring Romeo such sweet demise! One last visit, to rest by your side For surely a groom shall die with his bride The epitome of turtue, Has reached it's peek For now, death, Romeo shall meet.
