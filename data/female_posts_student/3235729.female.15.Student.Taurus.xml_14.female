So, at lunch today, in the cubby (as always) after we got back from 2-4-1, Brian and Kyle dropped by. Kyle is so fucking moody. Today he said that he supposedly hates Brian, but that'll probably change by tomorrow. But anyway, so Lindsay was telling us about how this comedian was going up to people and saying "Cake or death?!" and the 4th guy he asks is like "Cake please" "We're all out of cake. We only had 3 pieces, I didn't think it would be so popular." "Ok, so my choices are 'or death'?" "Basically." "Ok. I'll take the chicken." anyways, so we're telling random people as they walked by "You there! Cake or death?" Most people ignored us, but if they did we would yell "SLUT!". It was funny as hell.  So, I have comfirmed that Jesus is  definitly  attacking me. Me waking up to the "Jesus' Brother Bob" song after falling asleep in class, hearing the "King of Carrot Flowers 2/3" song while looking at a picture of Jesus while the light is ONLY shining on his face, and him attacking me for going out while I'm grounded. I'll explain now. So, I'm grounded for 2 weeks, right? So Autumn phones me at about 7:30. "Wanna come over?" She says. "I'm grounded, but it's worth a shot" Surprisingly enough, my dad lets me. (I was shocked) So the plans for the evening were simple. Play a little basketball, then walk to McDonald's because Autumn's mom wanted us to get food. So we played basketball for about 24 minutes (Yes, 24) then I was like "I wanna play soccer" so we did. For about 2 seconds. I try to deek her out and I twist my right foot. This hurt like fucking HELL. I was laying on the pavement, for like 5 minutes. The pain was, unimaginable. THEN I had to walk to McDonald's. Oh well. At least I get a "get out of dance free" ticket. Providing that Ms. Clark isn't a bastard.  Anywho, I find it hard to concentrate what with my drunken mom yelling at me for going out tonight, so...later.   -Joebie
