It is not everyday stuff you can figure it out without anybody's, I MEAN IT, ANYBODY'S HELP. Not even my computer genius bro. I did it all by myself. But I have to especially thank kao- ani's website. She makes great calendars and clocks, that's why I link her. She is great! Nothing is going to stop me, that include my oral I took in school today... My teacher said "___ (fill in whatever names you want), speak louder" OR "___, widen your vocab and talk more about the picture" -____- ANYWAY, I am trying to improve my settings and lots of interesting stuff. I not only want my blog to be a diary, but also a place to chat and escape from reality for a few hours....
