It'll just suffice to say that I'd probably be more comfortable going with a group of friends. Came home and decimated dinner. Don't know what that means. Decimate. Roman (or Greek?) soldiers took one out of ten soldiers in a platoon and killed them. Randomly. I'll have to look that up again someday.  I've been thinking (and here I sound like Jim Casy) that I've done a bunch of silly, mercurial things. I think it's time to stop. I can count them off in a chain. That makes four already. It's not even within my personality. And I don't even know what I want.  It's this late already? oh, the ways I spend my time...  afterthought: tonight's the last night I'm 15. Hard people I know would just tell me it's jsut another day, a milestone for the passage of time, and maybe I agree. But I'm 16 tomorrow. Might as well make something out of it? Perception-wise, 15 is still lame, still little. Sixteen is sweet sixteen and growing up. Emotionally, mainly. I hope things will take care of themselves. I think I need to just tire myself out toinght doing something random so I can go to sleep. But I've finished wrapping the 40-odd presents, so no solace there. No eating, that's overdone. No reading, nothing good around. Let me think of something.
