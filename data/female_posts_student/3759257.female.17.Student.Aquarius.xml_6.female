I'm fed up of this, i oddicialy have no real mates, the ones i thaught i had can't give a fuck about anything, and i dont have anyother mates, so im fucked. I think ill resolve to being best mates with my little sis and my mum. That would make me Quessn of SAD! YAY!!  Should i get tickets for Lostprophets or Snow Patrol? Or both? but i'm already going to see Hoobastank, and have seen Incubus, Evanescence and Chilies. Am I being a bit too greedy now??
