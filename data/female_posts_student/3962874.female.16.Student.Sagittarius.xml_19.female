I owe Daniel $3 for who knows what, and the rest I really need to save. I am going to have to pay for all of my school clothes this year because my mom doesn't have much money. Although dad's girlfriend said he would double what I earn, and what she says goes. So we'll see. Everything extra that I earn this summer needs to go towards college. No offense to him but I really don't want to be like my brother. I want to go to a really nice school like the Seattle Art Institute, or the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. Hopefully I will get some scholarships so I wont have to pay for all of it because those schools are really expensive. I don't even know what I want to do for a living, I just know I want to do something in design. I really like fashion design, interior design, and even architechture, how an I supposed to decide? One thing that sounds really interesting to me would be becoming a buyer. I would really like to be an intern for some clothing company and become an assisstant buyer to see what it's like. But ya never know. I'm going back to dad's tonight to work some more. Maybe we will work on my loft (an ongoing project that was promised to be finished by the end of the summer but probably never will). Oh yeah. Almost forgot (how could I?) Today is Daniel and I's 20 months! A year and 8 months is a really long time I am really happy. We were planning to do something fun but just hanging out is good for me and I really need to work so I don't thing it's going to happen. Speaking of planning, Daniel is planning something spectacular I guess for our two year anniversary. I really have no idea what it is and I love surprises (usually he's not very good at them but he is not even giving me any hints!) Why would he be planning something now that is going to heppen in November? Now I got to thinking about it dangit and I wont be able to stop. I'm excited and I can't wait.
