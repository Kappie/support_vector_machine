She provides moral support as well as hard labor in many moves throughout her family/friends. Not to mention her militant throw-away policy that helps pack rats in denial, like myself. Her common move-out quotes include: "Use it or Lose it," "This room is over-chotched" and "Burn 'em and buy more."    While on the topic of my mother, I just wanted to get this conversation in writing: We were discussing the now defunct Mudhouse building and I was explaining that the spot is a potential goldmine. My Mom got her creative juices running and started inventing names, her favorites being   Campy Campus Cafe   and   The Kat   (the later would include her huge collection of cat thchokeys). Also, she was brainstorming on a Broadway theme...I'll try to remember the menu names she came up with later.
