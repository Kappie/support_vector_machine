Vanakam  , my lovelies! yesterday was the 2.4km run.. i was honestly very pessimistic about it. on the other hand.. i felt so touched when i heard and saw  all  my friends cheering for me.. all my  2c1  ol' buddies..  valerene ,  zara ,  jo ,  shan ,  nat ,  esther ,  mich ,  shuyi ,  LAIKIU ...even the guys! whom i'm not close with..  shaun  especially? could hear him shouting my name.. then someone was sayin "pearlyn your face is very red!" ... also heard jo shouting that i can't give up since i've come this far.. then i heard a lot of "go pearlyn! you can do it!! c'mon!!" hahaa..  thank you...  everyone =) after i ran non-stop for 7 rounds.. i sprinted during the last round cos i tot time was going to be up.. then zara was jumping up and down hahaa.. then sprant.. to mr loh.. then he clocked my timing and said i did well. but...when me sprint finish.. i couldn't breathe.. then my inhaler was with  amelia  darling.. and i was struggling to say out her name.. luckily  lucas  was behind me and asked if i was ok.. i kept pointing towards amelia then he was all blur blur.. then like kept doing hand signals then the pple around kept shouting for amelia.. then she was like my "missy" (nurse).. took out my inhaler from her pouch where we put all our stuffs and passed it to me.    Val  cried cos she missed 2 secs to get 'A'.. then she say mr ng talkin to someone else then give her timing late. sigh. so she very angry loh.. kept swearing  IN FRONT OF ME . she knows that detest vulgarities. sigh. but ... it's okay lah.. she kinda apologised.. but i understand.. that's her, when she's furious. the day didn't get any better later though. unfortunately, jo lost her wallet. we searched high and low for it. nopes. so she went home depressed. our outing to celebrate ame's birthday in town was cancelled.  dad  called me. wanted me to go home right away, get changed and all. cos' couzie's havin house-warming. so like, i reluctantly went home and had to leave ames, val and shan.. saw  yongfa  at clementi interchange.  Couzie's house is really pretty =) a condo.. at sengkang.. like resort =D =D =D the pool is soo beautiful. i was telling my sister  cherryn ... if this is considered really cool, then i think i would've probably fainted if i were to join the  the bachelor  and stay in that kick butt bungalow loh. can die i tell you!! so zai! had bbq.. then did lotsa' stuff with my couzies too.. we caught an insect from the water at the fountain and left it in the cup =\ oh man.. the good ol' days! i don't know if many of you girls out there used to do this lah.. but last time when i stayed in my old place.. i had very fun neighbours who were mostly around my age. mostly boys. and this 1 girl from nanyang i rmbr clearly. we would go to the playground and behind it there's a huge drain where there were heaps of tadpoles. then once i took the net from my home cos' i had a fish pond with lotsa' kois.. then my grandmother found out that i took the net.. she scolded me! she didn't allow me to. so we had to make use of our brains and resources to make nets and all. used all sorts of methods.. hehee.. sticks.. pails..leaves.. etc.. it was SO FUN!! =) i loved those days when i had no homework and could catch tadpoles everyday. heheee. but everytime when i catch em' and put them in pails or bottles, my grandmother would persuade us to let them go. so eventually, my sisters and i had to let them go . =)   Okay anyways. today had  npcc  trng. celebrate ame's birthday with choc cake. yum. with 1 candle. played basketball and  berd  was sliding on the bball court as tho he was ice skating..cos it just poured. yea. quite funny. berd so rough tho! hit  jeff  until his lips bled. now around the cut got blue black oso. actually, it was purple when i saw jeff after trng. eeeks. we had light PT. then did drills from 9am-1pm. wowwee. at first we combined with sec 2s. was so disappointing. our morale and confidence level went low... very very low. promised ma'am  yeewen  to do gd job. but we let her down. she scolded us until her voice 'zao sia'. on the other hand.. mmm, i would say  we deserved it , undoubtedly. later we split. did a better job. confidence level and spirit shot up. then  sir faizal  came back to visit! homad him. haha. then  mrs abdul  eat vinegar (jealous)! teehee. so cute. =) the  bernard ma`am  never come today.. lols.. learnt new drills. so glad.. but I MISS FANCY DRILLS oredi.. =P after trng wendi fainted. poor boy.. =X i'm oso not very sure what happened.. hai..
