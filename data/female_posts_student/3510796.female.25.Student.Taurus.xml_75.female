See, I have a fair amount of friends, and I do go out with them quite a bit - we have some damn good times together.  Matt, well, he isn't exactly a social butterfly.  Outside of his occasional hangouts with people from work on Fridays, his network of friends consists of me (for the time being), his brother, and one other friend.  So, he sees me going out, hanging out al the time, gets jealous, and decides to take shots at me using the one aspect of my life he knows is non-existent - my sex life.  His boasts, stories, and allusions to the frequency with which he gets some are, I realize now, either mostly bullshit, or just dirty and sloppy, so either way it's nothing for me to be envious of.  So last night, I decided to put this theory to the test.  Good times.  After a long day of shopping for kitchen stuff, I decided to kick back and play some trivia.  I went over to Buffalo Wild Wings, where the special of the evening was 23 oz. Miller Lite for $2.25.  Already, I'm the winner.  Now, if you're not familiar with bar trivia, just go  urlLink here  and find out what it's all about.  It's addictive and fun, and with my love of game shows and useless knowledge, it's a perfect fit for me.  I played several games and came in 2nd place in a very competitive field every single game, losing one by only about 70 points.  The big hour-long game, which I played in between spicy garlic wings, was by far the highlight.  I was in the running all the way, going neck and neck with this regular, who is one of several who plays the big games there every single Tuesday and Thursday.  He also happens to be a former professor of mine - brilliant, Serbian, and at least a little bit nuts.  I don't know if he remembers me or knows that I play on occasion, but it sure is great to give him a run for his money.  So, the final round involves 6 questions in 6 different categories (the game, by the way, is called "Six",) which each player must assign point values to before answering.  The final question of the game comes up, we both get it correct right away for the maximum points - but he had wagered 6000 and I'd bet only 3000.  I lost the game by a scant 2500 - so close, but so far away.  Oh well, another draft will pick me up - and make the part of my brain where all the trivia is stored function a bit more smoothly.  Dunring my stay at BW3, I get a call.  It's Matt, no doubt wondering where I am.  I choose to press the "Ignore" button.  The voicemail he leaves confirms my suspicions.  Why does he care where I am?  Maybe he wants to know for certain that the coast is clear to bring some of his nasty action around.  Who knows, who cares.  A little later on, I get a call from the beloved Suzzy - it's Thursday night, and we're going out!  So a few of us head out, have a few, have some good times (Katrina's goal for the evening was to get drunk, and I'm happy to report that she succeeded).    Instead of going "home" after the bar closed, I decided to spend the night at my parents' house - they're on vacation all this week and next and told me that I'm welcome to stay there whenever I feel the need.  This was my plan for the night anyway, whether I'd be going to the bar or not.  I had my toothbrush and contact stuff packed, along with a few CDs.  It was a little odd being in my old bed, in my old room, the room is kinda empty now and has quite a bit of echo to it.  That, and where the heck is my other pillow?  There's only one on my bed now.  Had a peaceful night's sleep, the sounds of Mer de Noms faintly in my ears as I drifted off.  Wake up this morning, renewed, refreshed - with a new voicemail from Matt on my phone, wondering where I am, and if I "got lucky" last night, he says with a hearty laugh.  So I eventually make my way home, and I'm in quite a good mood.  Smiling and just generally happy.  And Matt's home, and seeing my emotional state, he's just like "What were you doing last night?  Oh my God, you *did* get laid."  So I just respond with "If that's what you want to think, you go ahead and think that."  You know, not confirming anything, but not denying anything either, just being deliberately ambiguous.  "I... I don't know what to think anymore," he says, walking away.  Now I"ve got him wondering, and I'm the one having fun at his expense.  It's good to have the tables turned.  So... no Grey this weekend.  She'll be off on an exotic getaway to a faraway land.  And as usual, I'll miss her.  But thankfully, I've got something to fill up my weekend besides work.  Promises to be fun.  And of course, best birthday wishes and much love to Sokie and Mo on the big 4.  Peace out.
