Now I find this to be rather strange, but I share with deepest sympathy Jeff's basic point of frustration - a frustration I also felt in 2000 - that this election is calling out for someone who will truly lead, truly inspire, who will dare to put forth a concept for what this country could and should be, rather than just saying whatever they think their party base will want them to say, or weaving from left to center depending on whether they are trying to win the nomination or the Presidency.  I too admire Kucinich, because he has the bravery to stand up and say what he thinks.  Now, I almost always disagree with what comes out of his mouth, but his veracity is a rare find in politics these days.  Perhaps it is the fact that he really has absolutely nothing to lose that makes him speak without fear; I like to think that it is the fact that it is just the way he is.  I am reminded of one of the Democratic debates I saw months ago, way back when everyone in the world was vying for the Democratic nomination, when one of the moderators asked each of the candidates to say one unpopular thing they would do if he (or she - we musn't forget Carol Mosely-Braun) were President.  Most of the candidates, including all the biggies - Dean, Kerry, Edwards - fumbled over themselves, saying that they would stand by their principles, but not being incredibly specific.  Only two of the candidates that I recall (though I must admit my brain is somewhat foggy on the details) were willing to say specific things that sounded remotely unpopular: Lieberman stated his basic committment to continue the fight that President Bush has been waging, the war on terror (which may not be all that unpopular, but considering Iraq has been a big issue in the Democratic primary, probably didn't do too much to gain him support)  Kucinich started off by saying that he opposed the death penalty, and then continued to list a whole other host of things that were truly unpopular - I can honestly say that I probably didn't agree with a single one of them.  But he actually answered the question, which almost no one else did.  And he gained a little bit of my respect that night.  But there are tons of people that I respect that I would never vote for.  And since I can't really watch Kucinich for more than five minutes without getting annoyed with what he is saying and changing the channel, I probably would find it difficult to cast my vote for him.  A lot of it comes down to personality with me, and if I can't stand looking at the guy for the next four years, then he's probably not going to get my vote.  This is what ultimately led me to not vote for Al Gore.  It's sad that this is the way politics works, but it is just the same.  I don't know who I'll be voting for come November, but whoever I do vote for, I cannot say that it will be with much enthusiam.  It might end up being the lesser of two evils, I might end up voting for Bush despite my reservations against him because of the importance of the war and my lack of confidence in Kerry to be up for the task in the way I think it should be pursued, or perhaps I'll end up voting third party again.  But it will be done with a heavy heart.
