And i've been dragging my art folio since like forever and believe me, I still havent completed it yet. O shit.. Of all things,haven done my SW. Damn. Damn.I'll say it again. Damn.       Nothing happened much in school.Oh..Woke up this morning only to find my contact lens case tilted and the solution inside the case spilled thru the airhole. So i thought it was okay to wear.. Hahaz. I thought wrong. Damn my eyes hurt alot. I had to wear my glasses instead. The glasses were of my previous degrees so obviously, I cant see that well even with the glasses on. Yes yes,my plastic nerdy glasses. Hehehe.. U know, one of my ex and his friends actually were laughing when they see me. I just dont get it why. I might look different, nerdy or whatever but why should they care man..I dont come to school to look pretty or Very presentable for them. I wear and do which i tink is best for me. And for that, they actually deserved my middle finger salute frm me. They did. Showed them before walking away. =)       Watched Korean War during my SS study hour just now. It was like sitting in the movies. Benji bought potato chips and I was like this mad girl,screaming and laughing thruout the whole class. Hahaha.. I don't know la.. I was x-tra hyper today.Too hyperactive. Hahahaha..      After our study hour,waited for nana,zsa,yana and farisah.Hidayah and shahidah didnt join us cos they went to meet their boyfriends. Tata was with me. And we all went to Econ to eat karipap cos zsa mengidam sangat. Hahaha.. We did what we do best. Eating and talkin abt our day plus the bitch-talking. Yeah.. bitch-talking.I love doing that.       So this is it. My day. Have no idea whats heading my way tomorrow. But something's for sure today.I miss Yayi again. Today is like 30 days he's been gone. And im still missing him. I love you. Good night my dearest. Love you like I always do. Hope this kiss reaches u.M wackz!!   ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~
