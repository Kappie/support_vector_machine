All is well at home, busy catching up and tending garden, lots of reading and organizing my material.  Alicia, what an eye-opening and mind-expanding experience your instruction and teaching skills afforded me. So much to continue learning and practicing as I continue writing. I have visited and registered at the site you recommended so I am continuing to experience your commentary and thoughts. Thank you.
