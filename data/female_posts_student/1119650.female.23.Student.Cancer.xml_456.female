I am guaranteed to be awake from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. That's approximately 16 hours I would say that I probably spend about 11 of those hours online (three of those hours I'm NOT on I'm at school with no computer available).  No wonder I feel like I'm flabby and over weight.  Its cause I am.  I am sitting in front of this idiot box all day.  I have decided to make a conscious effort and stop being a fatty lazy internet savvy girl with a wicked case of carpal tunnel.  From now on I will only be online during business hours (that's 8 am-4 pm Monday thru Friday) and on weekends, but I'm generally out with the boyfriend on those days so I won't probably be around then either.    I will kick it up at the gym and instead of doing one hour a day I will do two hours.  I will spend one of my extra hours cooking healthier meals for me to eat during the rest of the week.  I could get a hobby or something, I could even (gasp) volunteer.  I will start reading again (you know, that weird thing where you have actual bound papers with writing and you flip through them and they tell you a story).  This is totally out of control.  Seriously.  How I got this far I'll never know, but I refuse to be this lazy any longer.   **Those of you who actually know me know that I say something like this about once every six months and I go all gung ho about stuff for 2 weeks and then I go back to being lazy, slobby, fat self.  If you see me online and its not work hours don't talk to me.  Tell me to fuck off and stop being fat and lazy.  Thank you **
