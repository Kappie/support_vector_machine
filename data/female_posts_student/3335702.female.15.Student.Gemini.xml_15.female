Sitting in the grass, the air is cold, the kind of weather that you put on a sweatshirt, and just that will do. Where the air is crisp and it smells fresh. And the horizon seems only a mile away lined by birch trees. The sun is orange and glows, so that you could stare at it forever and never get bored. The breeze rustles your hair and his hand is in yours. No words are spoken, but all the words in the world are heard.
