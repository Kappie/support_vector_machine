For some reason it didn't come out, and I just want to try again.  Linds said that you had seen Witchblade, Michael.  What did you think, and how much have you seen?  This show is my obsession...well, one of many, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on the subject.  As for the rest of you, thank you for making sure that Michael knows I'm insane.  Wouldn't want him to suffer from any false images of me.  Great last few posts, Josh and Will.  Talk to you later, and you guys, check your e-mail.  NOW.  ~Z
