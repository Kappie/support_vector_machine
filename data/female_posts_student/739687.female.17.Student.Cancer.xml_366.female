Okay. I suck. I'm a sucky loser.  I've almost finished  House of Leaves , then I'll probably get  Hamlet , and  Cry, The Beloved Country  out of the way for school. I've got to read  Candide  for french, and I'm gonna read  Carnets  by Saint-Exupery as well. Just to keep caught up in the language stuff. Then I figure I'll read  The Picture of Dorian Gray , because well, it sounds good. And I picked out Bob Woodward's  Shadow , because lets face it, keeping a head into politics is vital if you don't want to be labeled 'ignorant', and Woodward is the god of current events/political journalism. I wanted to pick up  All The President's Men  instead, but they didn't have it. So I settled.  So that covers it. I guess I'll be pretty busy...I'm gonna have to balance the whole work/play/party thing.  But umm...right now...I'd say it's time for the partying to commence. I've been reading all day.  Okay, crazies, I'm out for the night.
