When Kurtz tells Capt. Willard "you have the right to murder me, but you dont have the right to judge me", he was right. Willard, in his journey to find Kurtz, learns more about him and his past as he gets closer. Knowing what he does about Kurtz, I believe that Willard does indeed judge Kurtz for his actions, at least at first. When he finally confronts Kurtz, he begins to realize what is going on around him and is more understanding about his own mortality. No mortal can judge another, because of the fact that he IS mortal. I do not judge Kurtz for his actions. I dont agree with or condonewhat he's done, not by a long shot, but I do realize that I am just as capable of becoming Kurtz myself, and therefore I am not worthy of laying judgement on him.
