The Giants lost 7-1 and only scored 1 run in eight innings off of Shawn Estes. How the hell do you only score one against Estes? We've scored 1 runs in 13 innings the entire year against one of the biggest headcases in baseball. Bonds went 1 for 4 with no walks, Kirk "Woody" Ruetergot the loss, giving up 5 runs in 6 innings.
