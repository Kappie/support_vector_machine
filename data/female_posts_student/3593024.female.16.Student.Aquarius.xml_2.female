Omg last night I was sleeping out in the camper at Sarahs house b/c I have no idea you would think Sarah likes to be scared.....lol Well Sarah is the one who always hears the noises and I kinda hear them but I try to ignore them b/c everyone knows that your mind can play tricks on you.  Well last night I heard like every noise and it was kinda scary b/c I didnt know what it was so I asked Sarah if she heard anything and at times she did, but she knew that if I heard the noises than there was something out there.  We never figured out what it was but we heard it like all last night and I mean I was so tired but I couldnt go to sleep b/c I was scared.  My aunt and uncle might be getting a divorce and I feel so bad for the kids b/c they have four and 3 of them are not even old enough to know what is going on but the one that does has to stay with her dad b/c she wants to take care of him.  It is awful I dunno what I would do if my parents ever got a divorce.  Well I have to go for now.....  Jess
