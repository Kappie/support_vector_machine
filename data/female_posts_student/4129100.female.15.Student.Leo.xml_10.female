My reason for being so hostile: my mother will not allow me to see Rem anymore, due to the fact that one of her "friends" told her that I was seen with Rem buying condoms. Not only that, but she also seems to think that Rem is not only having a sexual relationship with me, but with his current girlfriend, Lauren, and my best friend, Rhiannon.    Is it bad of me to want to kill both my parents, to hate the people that gave me life so much that it's tearing me down? Do they even realize what they put me through and what they have done to me over the years? Is it bad to want to be away from them so much that in 4 days I am leaving this house with no money and no place to stay? I know that no one really "likes" their parents, but honestly. Call it teen angst if you must.   You would think my mother would get used to the fact that I am a sexually active individual and not try and ban me from the guy I love. She already knows I have had sex and I am on the pill... GET OVER IT.    When I even bring up the fact that I was depressed, she blames it on my friends and on Kurt. I can explain to her hundreds of times that losing Kurt really meant nothing to me. I was more upset when leaving Myrtle Beach for crying out loud! And when I talk about why I dont like my father, she doesn't listen and she blames my friends, saying they dont like there fathers and I am just being a follower. Is it my fault that my father likes to get violent with me and see how fucking terrified of him I can become? I sure as hell hope that it's not my fault. Who knows, maybe I deserve all this. Maybe I dont deserve to have friends, to have Rem, love or an escape from this. Maybe all I deserve is this pain, this hatred and this feeling of complete and utter uselessness. Why do all good feelings fade?   I've vented all I can. Good Day.   .:-Sam-:.
