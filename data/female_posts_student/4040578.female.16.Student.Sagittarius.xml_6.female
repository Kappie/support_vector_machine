One dream which is somewhat reoccurring is a dream where my braces come off. It is so freaky and scares me to death. Yeah, I can't wait for the day I get them off, but in my dream when they come off my my teeth go back to being even more crooked and they also fall out. Ugh, just crazy I tell ya. I wonder what kind of weird dreams others have. Hmmm.      Moving on, today was like the most boring day I have had in a long time. I woke up early to try to accomplish whatever I wanted to do today. But nope, didn't do squat. Joshua did come over around 2 to fix the pc again and hook my printer up. Man, what would I do without him? After he left, I chilled some more and ate dinner. I did take a shower just so I could feel clean..haha. After my shower, I looked over how I want to schedule my homeschooling and then before ya know it, it was Big Bro time. So I watched that with my mom and now here I sit. By the way, I am curious where did everybody go? I receive no comments anymore, I feel so alone. Well not really, just want to know what's going on.      Ok, this blog was way to short. But like I said, today nothing happened. Hopefully tomorrow is better. Well, until next time, I am outtie!      Music Playin' in The Background: Float On- Modest Mouse
