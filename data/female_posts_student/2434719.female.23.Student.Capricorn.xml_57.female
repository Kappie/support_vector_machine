(it's prince.)  yeah, here we go. we're breaking the rules. and i don't do this often. i have a rule and  shit fuck damn  i keep it for life.  rule number one: you do not talk about fight club. (you have to keep a sense of humour at all times. that's one of the other rules.) rule number two: you know. rule number three: nothing personal.  i'm freaking miserable right now. i cried today and crying makes me tired... and being sad makes me exhausted. and boys make me miserable. and hence the exhausted tiredness of my meloncholy midnight.  it's not boys. it's not. it's a personal problem here. it's a personal problem we ALL go through, and don't even try to tell me you havn't. the: " what is it about me " moments. it's a time to cherish, eh?  i'm going to be honest here.   i think i'm cool.  yes i love dinosaurs.  yes i snort when i laugh.  yes i day dream for hours. yes i scream at cows and mustard bottles.  yes i read educational books for fun.  yes i laugh at farts.  yes i like to write in my blog. yes i sing to lionel richey at least once a day. yes i mis-label all the small states on the US map cause damn it, i just don't know.  and this is what mostly sucks, even though i think it's all great: it's not. :(   there are some things i won't shake. cause damn it, i'll always be a nice girl. and i'll always kiss with my eyes closed. and i'll......... oh forget it. fuck it.
