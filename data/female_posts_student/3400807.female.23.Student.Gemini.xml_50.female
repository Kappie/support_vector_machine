One of my kids brought me an apple yesterday! Do you have any idea how excited I was about that? It means they think of me as a   REAL   teacher! Silly? Me? Obviously, you're unaware of the fact that Silly is my middle name! It was about the sweetest thing. Anna (the little girl who once asked me, "If God made everything, did He make Himself?") came up and tugged on my skirt (because, obviously, tugging on my clothing is the   very best   way to get my attention) and held the apple up for me. Initially, I thought she had brought it for her own snack. The kids do that occasionally. So I thanked her for bringing it to me so it wouldn't get lost and told her I'd give it to her at snack.  

She shook her head no, put her hands on her hips, and said, "Teacher! It's for   you!  " As if it was the most self-evident thing in the world and I must be terribly dense not to know that.   

"Oh, Anna! That's so sweet! Thank you for bringing the apple for me. It looks really good. I'm going to wait to eat it until I get home, though, because there's not enough to share with everyone, ok?"  

"Ok." She turns to go play, oblivious to the fact that I'm tearing up.  

Does that mean I'm a big kid now?
