(not that there is much fun to have fun in...but i bet some shall appear just as i sit down to another two hours of de valera, just you wait...)*sighs* i'd better pass, that's all i can say. and do you know what i am forced to study? the flippin inepitude and downright sneakiness of the unionist government, who dad always taught me were perfect. do you know what they did? they introduced a law that made it possible to arrest and detain people without trial. isn't that incredible? in 1922 or something this law was made, which meant basically they could just chuck you inside if they didn't like the look of you. and do you know when this was lifted? in 19 flipping 70!!! and it didn't really change then either, they just amended it into the internment law, which was the same sort of thing. apparently jerry adams was interned for years. i mean i don't like him and all his ira links, but he does have a very legitimate reason to be pissed off. you can bet no unionists were chucked in jail for no reason.     in other news, my little sister is going away tomorrow to camp. this means a whole week of lying in! yes!! (i am usually awoken by her elbowing me in the ribs so i jump about a foot in the air) also tomorrow i am hopefully seeing samuel again. samuel is a three year old who goes to the baptist church which i frequent from time to time. he refers to me as "big friend". once he poured an entire ice cream tub of crayons on top of the scary guy who likes me and keeps kicking me under the table's head. this cemented our friendship. our games of "mutant dinosaurs attack noah's ark" are the stuff of legend. it's nice to be liked, nay, adored. i am a semi-god to him, especially when i am wielding the digestives. :-)
