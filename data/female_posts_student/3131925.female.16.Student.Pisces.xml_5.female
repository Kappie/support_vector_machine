On Sat I was just hangin around and Jessie called me sayin some fat bitch Erin was tryin to kcik her ass so I drove over as fast as I could be she was gone. Carlye, Marie and Jessie were all outside, they said that Jessie's mom told them to leave. So of course the bitches that we are, went off to look for them lol. We walked over to Jetty Surf and chilled outside on the tables. Then Jessie said they were coming and all you could see was 3 girls cause they were down by the corner store and they started walking our way. Right when they got by us I realized that one of Erin's friends was KATELYN, stupid little freshman bitch who tries starting shit with me at school but is way to much of a pussy to say it to my face. At first we just watched them walk by then Carlye got up and spazzed out and started calling her a fat bitch and stuff and we just laughed lol. Then one of Erin's friends tried talking and Marie told her to shut the fuck up and Katelyn wasn't saying anything but she bothered me so I yelled at her and she was like, wtf I didn't even say anything lol. Then of course after we left..we bumped into them again..and again..and again..and once more again lol. Funny thing was, was that they were such pussies that they would wait until we not only crossed the street, but we were also over 100 yards away from them. So on and off we'd be screaming shit back and forth. Then later on we wanted to go over to Kathrines and get fucked up or w/e and she wasnt there so we walked back to Jetty Surf..and on the way we saw them lol. Three of them and Three of us walking along the sidewalk, and of course you know no ones going to move. Me and this bitch bumped shoulders hard, and Marie's hit Katelyn's, and I think Carlye moved cause we all know Erin's just nasty lol. I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME CARLYE!  Then the bitch I bumped shoulders with actually told me don't fucking touch me stupid bitch, so I said hard not to when your fat ass covers the entire sidewalk where the fuck am I supposed to go..and she actually said around..wtf lol. Then of course once we were 200 or so yards away, they decide to talk shit. We went back to Jessie's and chilled and thought..why the hell didn't we just turn around once we all bumped shoulders and start hitting em?! So we went back out but this time, we decided to go over by their house. We could see their house a few streets before and we saw them peeking around the corner then the three of them sat on the curb like it was all casual when it WASNT lol. We didnt say andthing and turned down tony's street and OF COURSE AS ALWAYS, once we're almost by the beach at the end of the street, she decides to call Marie..grandma. hahahaha. So we chilled on the beach then decided to just go back to Jessie's. But we had to walk by their house just cause we wanted to start shit lol. Once we got to their house there was a car with headlights on and we're all thinkin..these fucking bitches are prolly gonna try and start it up and scare the shit out of us or something, so we all told eachother, DONT FLINCH..but once we got there it was the bitch that hit my shoulder in the car with her dad and another guy outside of the car sayin, "the girls dont wanna stay here anymore." HA! Pussies..we intimidated the shit out of them. Now I just can't wait for school tomorrow. It can only make things that much more interesting.
