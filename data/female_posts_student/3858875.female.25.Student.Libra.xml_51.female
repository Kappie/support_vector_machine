C: A lot of East Indians J: East Indian Gangsters C: And then there's a lot of asians in Richmond J: Yeah, and all of Vancouver, too.  .... J: All these rich people who come in with their bling bling cars. It would be nice to have people who actually work hard.  C: Yeah, well in Hong Kong, where all of the 'Hongers' come from, they have this one child rule, so the one kid gets all of the wealth from the parents.  ... J: The only times I went to Richmond was to go to Ikea and to this chinese restaurant. No english was spoken. Supposed to be the best Chinese food in Vancouver.  OH MY GOD!!! I knew I live with geeks, but i didn't realize I'm living with bigots!   ooh... homophobic too:  C: This one guy i knew had like no gag reflexes, so i started calling him gay.   C: Davie's the gay district J: The gayest place on earth C: one of the guys said, you can probably buy a lot of sausages on Davie! One of the guys didn't think it was funny, but I did.
