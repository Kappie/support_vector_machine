My head is swimming with ideas and thoughts and I want to just write everything down but some of them are so awful I don't want to share. But, today I witnessed a horrible act of prejudice and racism, nothing violent, just awful words spoken. People who think that just because someone is a different race, religion, etc. I can't stand it. I try my best not to think like that and when people do it makes me so mad. Today I was so furious I could've screamed. I heard some of the people I love call other human beings terrible horrible things that made me want to cry and yell at the same time. Racism, prejudism anything of that nature, is just not cool. If you think like that then you're a moron because God created all man equal and who are you to try and upstage God? Pigs.
