Somehow Taylor, Eric, and Marc ended up following us the whole way back. Taylor was lke treating them like her slaves. I felt really bad for M+E I was like come han gout with us! But we obviously aren't good enough for them. :)  So emily and I got tired of the hwole cave thing so we went and sat in the bus. Emily told Taylor that she ate  meat (they were seeing who could last the longest and emily won, but she cheated!) and Taylor was like "I HATE YOU!" and we were like "Want to tell us something new, JERK" well we didn't say that. We just left and went to go find Heather and the rest of the gang. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THEM. Always looking down on me like I am inferior. I must calm down. School is ending soon.   Then everyone got back on the bus and we went to this other hiking place but Heather, Sara, Emily, and I stayed in the bus and played cards. I lost!   Then everyone got back on the bus and it was all jolly. But taylor will NOT STOP flirting with my eric and marc. I am like Taylor, you know what. YOUR NOT THAT ATRACTIVE. Wow. That was really mean. Sorry, I am just a little mad.  At one point during the bus ride I was looking at eric and eric turned around and smiled at me so I knew it was okay. He doesn't like taylor.  Then when we arrived home by brother was like "Guess what" and we took off his beanie and I was like "OH MY GOSH. WE ARE TAKING YOU TO THE HOSPITAL" as it turns out he ran into a piece of rock sticking out of the cave and like got knocked out. He said blood was pooring everywhere. Thankfully, his boy scout friend had a first aid kit (those boy scouts!) which him and he wrapped gauze around his head. My brother didn't tell anyone! So he was walking around everywhere bleeding. Geez. The gauze was like soaked with blood.   Then I had improv and I was too tired to be funny.  My brother is getting stiches right now. :o  Those HURT!
