The main criticisms that I can provide after this cursory glance deal mainly with aesthetics.  The photo collages that appear on many of the pages are beautiful images, however, it bothers me that some are black and white while others are color.  I say pick one and be consistent.  I do agree with Lindsey's previous post that the recurring background circle images are good,  but I see them as just a single element that seems to reveal the artistry of the actual theater and its works.  I would like to see the website strive more to convey the images (real and invoked), philosophies, and practices of this prestigious theatrical institution through design.  As we all become more familiar with the site, I'm sure there will be usability issues, but my first thoughts remain with the aesthetics after all, isn't that what we are usually left with regarding impressions?  The site is pleasant, but I'm sure it can be even better.  SDH
