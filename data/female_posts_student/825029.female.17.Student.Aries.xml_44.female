But now, since she wasnt here today and we have TAKS tomorrow our test will be on wednesday which was the day we were supposed to do our boats which were also due.  then our planes are due the next day........?  but the next day would be friday which we have off..... i hate school not just... like... taylor griffin kind of hate where she just says it because she has something wrong with her mind and she needs to make a statement because otherwise no one pays attention to her because she is not interesting.... i actually hate it.  it is... the compilation of all the teachers and how none of them seem to give a shit about anyone because obviously we dont have any sort of... "other classes" or "lives" fuckers. im gonna stop writing cause its stupid and i dont care.
