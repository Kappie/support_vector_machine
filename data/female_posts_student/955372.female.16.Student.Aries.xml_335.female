Let's see what was it this time... ah yes we were listening to a cd i made and he said "who is this" and i go "lifehouse, it's breathing" and he goes "oh i thought it was someone doing a cover of a Tori Amos song" i'm like "um, no. The piano would be more prominent, and the lyrics would be a million times more insightful." his response "oh i guess the way teenagers think today is that they have to correct everyones opinions" THANK  YOU COMMANDER ARROGANT because it's not like anytime i open my mouth he corrects me, even if i say something like "i like cheese." it seems like you couldn't correct that statement but OH NO he finds away. ok i'm done ranting for now *breathe breathe*
