Well, anyhoo, on Monday I took Joely out for pie since it was his bday. We had fun, and now he can drive and it's awesome! On Tuesday I had a concert, and it was so much fun! Not, but what the hey. Then today I went to school and came home. GeeGee gave me a chocolate easter egg. It was yummy. And that was the highlight of my day. Tomorrow Joel is taking me somewhere after school to buy me something and I don't know what it is...
