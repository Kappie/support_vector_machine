This past month we have been having crazy weather. I can't wait until spring comes. School is going well. I do have a alot of reading but that's ok. I can't wait until the first week of March because we have the whole week off of school. I will be spending that time with my parents. I am going home for the whole week. My brother is lucky because he has this week off of school. Next week he will be starting a new semester. Anyways i have to go for now. Have a great day! Take Care!
