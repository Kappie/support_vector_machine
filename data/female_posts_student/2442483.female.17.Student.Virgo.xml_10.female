(i think this probly means i win the bet doesn't it ben?)  and so begins of a downward spiral for lara of self destruction. within the next 9 months of this i failed my school subjects, got arrested for theft, smoke and drank and had another guy spike my drink (not that it needed spiking i was serverly wasted) to the same ends as my 'date' with andrew. i have now being raped twice in 3 months pretty good record hey. this spiral ended with me being kicked out of school.      and since then i have being serverly depressed. there have being some good times like ross my first love(dont take that the wrong way thats what he was my first love) whom i was with for 11 and a half months, and the restoration of a friendship that i destroyed during my crash.  the funny thing about being depressed for so long is that it evolved over time for so long i was just angry and hated my self, i loathed myself and tried to kill myself numorous times but obviously i failed at even that. theres a sucidal teens thoguht for you  when we try and kill ourselves and fail  it actually makes us feel like bigger failures because we couldnt even succed at a simple thing like that  my depression changed this year though, for basicaly my entire school carer i've have being teased and i've always had a really thin skin when it came to things like being told i was ugly or a loser or whatever the people at school were saying at different times, but this year i went back to school and i just didnt care, i wasnt angry or hurt or sad or hapy i was numb i just plain didnt care about anything. things that i loved no longer held any joy and things i hated no longer caused whatever it was that they once caused be it anger or sadness or whatever, being numb is the stragest feeling because you know what you should be feeling and you dont  i've became very adept at faking emotions over the last few months but the funny thing is i dont need to anymore and i know this probly puts a hell of  alot of pressure on ben but its done. the reason i no longer have to fake what im feeling is for the first time in months because i can actually feel again and its not self lothing and sadness and anger as it has being since i was 13 but happieness im actually truely happy and it feels so good, i can smile and mean it and i cant stop smiling and the best part is i havent had one bad though about myself since i met ben   you make me happy and feel wanted and pretty and samrt and all the things i havent felt in soooo long.  there ive posted now i have to go and pack because im going to tasmainia tomorrow for my sisters 21st birthday.   so TTFN to one and all and to all a goodnight   p.s. for those that dont kow TTFN is what tigger in Winnie the Pooh says it means ta-ta for now
