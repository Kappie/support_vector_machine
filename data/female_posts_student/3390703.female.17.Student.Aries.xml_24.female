I can't go through this again!  I'm sick of people I care about hurting themselves!  Yeah, sure ... I haven't seen Kyle in awhile, but I do talk to him online occasionally and I do care a lot about him!  And to hear how hurt Ashleigh was hurt me!  Because I love her and I just want her to be happy and for everything in her life to be happy, INCLUDING her brother!  God Kyle, why do you have to be so fucking stupid?  Don't you understand that you're not the only one you're hurting!  You're hurting everyone around you as well!
