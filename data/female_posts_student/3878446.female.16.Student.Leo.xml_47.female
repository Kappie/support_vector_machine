It didn't have the best fighting seens and it didn't have the best love story, but if you want to see a movie for the historical aspect of it, King Arthur is the movie to see. It was the most accurate movie I have seen about King Arthur and his Knights. But then again, with so many different legends and stories around, what is accurate? But I love how the movie portrayed each Character. Usually in movies you see alot of King Arthur and Lancelot, but none of the other Knights, but in this movie you see the lives of the other Knights as well, and the friendship they have formed and the brother-like qualities they all share. And Lancelot isn't portrayed as King Arthur's right-hand man, but his best friend. Though Guinevere came off a bit of a hoe-bag...to me atleast. I don't care what the critics said I loved the movie. Mainly because I'm a nerd and love history, but still, it was a great movie. I encourage all of you to see it. I'll see it again, and I know I'll buy it when it comes out...Great movie.
