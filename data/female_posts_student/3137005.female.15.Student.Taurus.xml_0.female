Okay So I’m 14 yrs old and I come from jolly old England…you know, ‘spiffing’, and ‘By Jove’ and all that stiff upper lippy shite. Anyways I’m not, as you can probably tell, part of the social elite of Britain, therefore (sorry to all you Americans) I don’t talk like that, I don’t really talk like anyone really….I’m unique: ).   I like riding and swimming, oh and my violin,  I’m no Mozart by I can bang out a damn good version of Twinkle Twinkle or even a carol or two…should the occasion arrive of coarse. I’m not a carol singing freak or anything….really I don’t even like carols that much…I hate them…Really I do…Okay so I don’t…………..WELL YOU GET THE PICTURE!!!!!!!   Anyways okay time for my observations of wonder time, pay attention because you know this is once in a lifetime thing, I’ll probably never think this again. ‘If an Astronaut was sponsored by flake, would he/she eat one in space (like in the ad), because you know I was thinking about how messy they are to eat, and then I thought imagine eating it with no gravity, flake everywhere! In your hair, on your space jumper, down your space pants, up your space nostrils, okay your nostrils are you own, but you get the picture anyway’ Okay that is the end of my observation, and I shall leave it for you to ponder as Dani’s thought of the day.  Toodles (my god I haven’t said that in ages) Dani
