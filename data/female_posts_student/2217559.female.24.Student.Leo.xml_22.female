We had a graphic designer meet us at the Whisky Bar and we were able to nail down a lot of great ideas for the design of our company logo and website. The website should be up and running hopefully within the next few days and I will post a link once that happens.  I know Tess (graphic designer) will do a great job. I got home last night and just layed on the couch...watched TV.  I was exhausted after such a long day. AJ gave me a ride this morning to work and that was really nice. I know he hates it because it is so out of the way for him but he loves me and that helps.  I booked an airline ticket yesterday to go home for the weekend. I fly into Hobby about 6:30 and I am so excited to go home to visit with my mom and Richard. I was thinking of driving to my grandparents' on Saturday but I just learned today that my grandmother is hosting my grandfather's high school reunion at their house and so I guess they will be really busy. I may just go to hang out with my aunt char and other family members. I miss them all so much. It seems like forever since I have gone and spent time with them. My grandparents' farm is incredible. 400 acres of land, cows, tractors, dogs, crafts and lots of comfort food.  I usually go at Thanksgiving for about 4 days but looks like this year I will be on a cruise ship by then. I think my grandmother is planning to have Thanksgiving early for me which is incredibly sweet.  I am sad about leaving my babies - Jennifer and AJ. They are the two most important people in my life.  Jennifer and I have grown so close over the last four months.  I will miss her so much.  I have so many fears about leaving for 6 months - like will everything change between us?  I know we will stay in touch and I just hope that what we have is still here when I return.  I know long distance relationships don't carry the best track record but maybe we will be the exception.  (Although I don't think I have ever had a long distance relationship).  I told AJ this morning about my cruise job on the way into work.  He was really sad and I know that my leaving will be hard on him. We have been very close friends for about 3 years now and have grown to treat each other as brother and sister. He really has been a great friend to me and I know that I will miss him and our friendship most of all.  I will miss all the lazy afternoons and evenings of us hanging out and being stupid.  Making retarded noises, laughing uncontrollably and just being silly kids. He truly is one of the only people I have met in my life that I can share my most ridiculous side with.   I have my bible study tonight - unfortunately, I don't think I am going to make it. This no-car having crap is for the birds. I can't even get where I really NEED to go. Hehehe.  Mom's giving me a car this weekend so all my problems of transportation will soon be gone. Yippee!
