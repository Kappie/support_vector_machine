After I got home, I showered, slept from 8:30 AM 'till 11 AM, and then I got up. Everyone else slept 'till afternoon (at least) or like, 4 PM or something. But yeah, I got up and ran the rest of the day on two and a half hours of sleep. Not bad, if I may say so. But yes, I woke up, had lunch with Sam at the mall, and then postered stuff with Mikey.  All in all, a rad day.    Message to MATT: I would LOVE to go to your house to make lunch tomorrow. I'll have to check with the 'rents though, since I'm already out in Vancouver tomorrow evening. (Mesa Luna thing.) Speaking of which, Dyllan's apparently not going.
