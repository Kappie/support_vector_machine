O.o I swear, my Laptop knows I am going to replace it on Friday with a PC Desktop, because the damn thing rolled over and died on me on Saturday. I mean...for no reason. The hard drive erased, and for a couple of hours I couldn't even reinstall the OS.   Like it just said..."*#*$# You!" *dies*  Anyway, after exhausting my extensive powers over the technological, I finally managed to get it up and running again. But, Sorry Mac G3... I love you, but I'm still replacing you. :P  My brother's graduation was today. I even managed to go through the entire day without arguing with my mother. Go me.  But now I'm tired. This post is probably garbage, but hell.
