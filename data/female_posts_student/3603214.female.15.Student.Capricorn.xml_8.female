He left a card for me in the mailbox cuz he didn't think I'd want to talk to him. It's a kitty pawing at something and it's just...I didn't need that right now. It's like I'm haunted by old memories of him. And it just hurts so bad. I'm back to crying constantly and I...I...I just shouldn't have opened it. It's the little things that always get to me and that will never change. I just don't want to hurt anymore. I just want to be free to live 'normally'. Or as normal as I can. I just feel so guilty cuz I still love him but I still hate him. I'm just so confused. And I can't stop crying and I need someone to talk to but since it's 8:30, I don't think my chances of finding someone awake are that good. I just need something and I don't know what...So I'm leaving today. I'm livin it, I'm leavin it to change And somehow I miss it. I think I really miss it...yea, stole from a song...I need to find love again because it's lost and I don't remember what it feels like to have love. Or compassion. Or happy memories. I need help...I just want for one minute to feel that way again. But it's not comin....I talked to Ben S. last nite *thezzy* and we just talked for a while and I need to start talkin to him more often man. He made me realize that I'm loved no matter what. But the thing is, I can't love back. And if I can't even do that, how can I feel that strong of an emotion? I'm trying to find God in all this, but I can't see the light and it scares me. I don't wanna lose God. I don't want to lose everything that I might slightly care about. It's just so much bad has happened I can't be positive. So I leave you with my tears of sadness, not joy. I miss everyone already. I don't know if I really want to go anymore. All I really want is to just be HAPPY
