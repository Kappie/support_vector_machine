Eugh, it is kind of hard to walk around the chair without it falling on my foot though... hmm... Owchiesie! My arm hurts. :( I had two jabs today, cause I'm going to Russia! Yeay! I was fine having them done... but they kind of made me a bit dizzy and my arm hurts now! And that sugar cube... what a weird polio taste! *mmm freak taste* But hey, I got a Australian crunch later! *and I just had a gingerbread man* I'm ill I swear! I'm not usually this mad... *yeah... right...* What happened to bracket girl? *wouldn't you like to know teeheehee* Mmm... but any way... I really should be doing homework. Nahh, I'm ill right! *actually really dizzy and a bit zonked* Uhuh, normal then I guess. Hey woow! You can download FY from here:  urlLink http://www.animezone.co.uk/home.htm  Wow!
