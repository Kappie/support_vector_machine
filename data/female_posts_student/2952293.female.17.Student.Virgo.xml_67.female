My mom said, "You like all those exotic flowers that are hard to grow!" (and she always says I look exotic) So I replied, "Exotic and rare, like my ass hair." WE BOTH LAUGHED REALLY HARD. Well, I thought that was funny, so I shared it. Now I am going to go feed homeless at the shelter with LEAHY! Leahy rules! I'm not studying! BYE BYE!
