I am no sports person or exercise person. But instead I am so interested  in the Olympics. Daydreaming away infront of the TV too. *Sigh*  After Financial Management Class, now at efac doing my e-commerce project part A. ....................Headache Don't really know how to go about. I even promised Irfan to collect data on hairsalons' pricing for him. As a favour, gosh even my horoscope for the week advised me to help others. For I might benefit from it all, I don't care about the benefits I am only afraid if I don't help. Grudges might be bear against me. What to do......... Really like an orange in a foodprocessor, chopped up and diced nicely. Really cold in the efac lab, fingers are getting number by the min. Going off soon.
