Umm, I think I'm gonna run away on that day cause otherwise I'm gonna end up getting covered in flour or something... help! Mmm, plus he's being rebeleous (at least I attempted to spell it!) and he's going to the ball wearing a kaftan instead of a suit! HA TAKE THAT! Sorry, just all the girls are really vane and like "You've gotta make and effort. Oh and cut your hair!" I would never say that to anyone! It's just tight and obnoxious! Yeah, but I'm afraid of what he's gonna do on Thursday! Oh, the ball's at a really posh place, and I can't see them getting drunk there! Although... Hmm, wonder who his date'll be... maybe I should stop wandering! Eeek, dead scary thought! Aargh, I'm going back to my hole! I need a vacation!
