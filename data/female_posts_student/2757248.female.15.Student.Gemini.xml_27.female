I know i know, im such a great big sister. So after that i couldnt go to sleep i just layed on the couch until other ppl woke up. which was at about 6:30 or so. then my dad woke up and my gpaw went and got us donuts we ate got ready left LC around 9 got into spring about 11:15 so i walked into my NEW HOUSE! *sighs* finally. well yeah, i went to look at my room w/alla my new furniture.. FABULOUS.. imma LOVE those EGYPTIAN SATIN SHEETS!!! mm mm mm.  after i enjoyed my room i went downstairs to talk to dad and he was like "halley go put my drills in the garage." so i was like ok. i went in the garage and my sister followed behind me and we couldnt see so she turned on the light for me.....................
