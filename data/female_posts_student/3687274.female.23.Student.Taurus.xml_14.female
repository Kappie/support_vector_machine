There was this guy there that looked a lot like ashton kutcher???.  He was cute.  He was getting married and not out looking to fuck someone, but just wanting to mingle.  But he kept getting shot down.  Poor guy.  So, I brought him to my circle o' friends and he danced with us.  He was happy then.  He gave me a kiss on the cheek and thanked me for dancing with him.  It was cool.  I was pretty drunk.  It's cool though.  I've had this change...my friends say I'm growing as a person but...I don't go to clubs looking for attention anymore.  I used to get all dolled up, but now I just throw on some jeans and a tee and a little makeup and hit the road.  It's cool.  I feel good about that.   Today we got a phone call from our friend Nicci.  It's her last day in town and we are going to hang out with her, hopefully.  She's the third in our group to get married.  Crazy people gettin' married all the time like they ain't got no sense.  Oh, I don't mean that.  Whatever makes them happy.  And for the most part they seem to be.  So, yea.  Well, that's all that's happened in the past 24hrs.  I think.  PEACE
