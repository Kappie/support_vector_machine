I have personally realized that I act like I am five-years-old over something that has little significance over my life and yet it seemed like I was willing to give up a perfectly healthy friendship over the most stupid things in life...and this is sad.  If that other blip made no sense to you as a reader, that is okay. We all find that ignorance is bliss at one time or another (seriously, we do). In other news, I get to start my house/cat-sitting job today. I am very excited as the house where I am at is very close to my work and the cat has the most interesting character of some of the cats I have met or cat-sat. Izzy (short for Isabella) is very interesting and peculiar, with a lot of affection to show...no Adam, you cannot put her into a box though...Last year when I was cat-sitting her I was watching Red Dragon and at the part at the end she jumped on my lap and scared the jebus out of me. Little She-Devil.  Anywho, I gotta start packing up my stuff...I was going to do it last night but fell asleep at 9, only to wake up at 1 to ppl who don't know how to keep their voices down and seem to think that the world revolves around them  Laters...Amanda
