A new and innovative format, it re-establishes the democratic spirit of poetry slam by forcing artists to engage the audience, minus the dated gimmick of the competition.   "The whole scene has gotten too safe, too predictable," explains the founder and former curator/host of the highly acclaimed  a little bit louder  reading series, and co-author of  Burning Down the House  (Soft Skull Pr, 2000). "I want to shake things up a little bit. Put a little controversy back into the mix and challenge the artists and the audience on their reflexive acceptance of bullshit."   The 90-minute show will include performances and a free-wheeling,  Politically Incorrect -style debate and debuts at the Bowery Poetry Club on Saturday, March 27th at 8pm SHARP! Co-hosted by Eric Guerrieri  Helen Yum, with special appearances by Jessica Torres, Mara Jebsen  Luis Cartagena.
