Last night Mom and I picked up some subs from King's, and the guy working the cash register was a freak of nature. Well, not really, but he boggled my mind. He looked Hispanic (no big deal there, since 75% of the people who work in restuarants around here are Hispanic), but he had a really strong Italian accent (which by itself would not be a big deal, because the owners are Italian, and often they are curse very loud in Italian).. ...But he didn't look a bit Italian!   ...Yeah, I know, it's no big deal... I'm just really bored right now..  And I feel sick.  I took some Dimetapp for my cold a couple hours ago, and since then, I have been feeling like I am going to vomit and am now feeling weak and shaky...   ....Like I said I'm bored..   Not even music is entertaining me. ...But  Adult Swim  is coming on in 30 minutes...  Yay!...
