Act as if everything is alright, when obviously it isn't. Ok, just to get all my fantasy readers into my real world here is how the story goes...  My mom, is dead. Nothing much to say here. Thats it. My dad, wants nothing to do with me because I'm a girl. So what?!. Meh, I live with the people I call "Mum  Pop". They never tell me anything. at all. I know they dont love each other like they used to but, please when something goes wrong...just tell me. I hate finding things out on my own. Its just wrong. Yeh. Wrong. Bah, Fuck it  I mean, nothing in my life has ever been remarkably "fun". I'm the one everyone hates to love. I'm sweet, caring...blah blah blah. Ok maybe not. I am anti social, a bitch to some extent, nosey, stuck-up and hot headed. If I was to go on...There would be no more room left...lol... I always get the pity...when someone finds out what happend...I'll try to lie..so that they treat me the same...but they  ALWAYS  find out!! WHY!? Bah. Fuck it.  But now...things with Mum and Pop aren't going so well...Its like I dont exist. They never tell me anything they always make it seem as if I am too much trouble for them. FUCK IT..!!  Well they tore it apart my  "family"  Are a bunch of nitwits and all hate each other. I came back from something with a special friend of mine, to find that  mum  wasn't home. I asked  pop  where she was...and he said she had left...To wherE? he will not tell me...Oh Goddammit! She still isn't back...and I came back last night!  *cries*   You see...everything is gone. All my illusions they are actually FAKE!   I wish I could talk to someone...but Meggiez and Mookie are up stairs and I dont want to bother them...{NO...THEY AREN'T DOING  THAT !!} Even someone online would be great..I talked to Joel...but that dont help me any...I dont know why I dont talk to Tae anymore...I guess its because he is annoyed with me...for not posting in Scrrap...Meh.   I cant talk to Billy..hes moving all day today. Joey was here...but its no use...I want to talk to Billy...Alot. Lets go see if his mobile is on...RIP Jenn~ SEM
