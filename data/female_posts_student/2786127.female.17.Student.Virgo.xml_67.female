I really didnt think it was doing that much to help my depression until i didnt take it two days in a row. Yesterday during volleyball I was frustrated and pissed and freaking out. I started crying and couldn't, literally, stop. After our game my coach told me to go up to the bleachers and do whatever it takes to calm me down. As I sat in those bleachers with my sweatshirt hood over my head, my  watch me dissapear mix playing in my ears, I stared at my teamates reffing down below and tried to take deep breaths to stop crying. After a few deep breaths i was still tearing up and sobbing...and i started to get scared because i couldn't stop myself. I didnt really even know WHY i was crying, really.  so to avoid being scared like that again, i will take my medication everyday from now on. We'll be joined at the hip, that bottle of pills and I.   Oh? the volleyball you ask?  Im so fucking happy this season is over.   I've never played with a worse team in my entire life.  And so its over. and now i don't care anymore.  I really wish i would have taken my damn pills on the trip, I'm all pissy today and have been sitting around trying to get a tan. Matt came over and I was super annoyed with him so i sent him home and told him I was in a bad mood and thats why i didnt want to hang out. which i was.  This weekend I have also come to the realization that I am lonely once again. Weeee!! So much for likeing being single, that lasted a whole 3 weeks. *sigh*    I tried to go to church today to hang out with Lindsay to find out that her and her family left this weekend for a little mini-trip. Why am I so completely out of the loop with lindsay these days? Good lord, i had no idea she was leaving.   JOB! if i dont have a job this summer i will drive myself to complete and utter madness from being so bored. bored bored bored bored booooooreeeddd.   I've decided that i like truck stops. They're funny little things, complete little worlds inside one small building. Tiny deoderants, keychains, toothbrushes and books. Food, jewelry...everything you need in life, its all there. I saw a magnet yesterday in a truckstop in Jerome Idaho that said "My cousin went to Texas and all they got me was this lousy magnet" WTF??!?! last time i checked...we live in idaho...but okay. But i told makenzie we're going on a road trip, and on that road trip we are visiting many many truck stops. because i like them.  i had a nightmare the other night in my hotel room. Iraq came over to america and started bombing everything and takeing prisioners and stuff, it was utter chaos and i was trying to escape with my life as well and genies and ashleys. weird, and it scared me too. But we escaped alive, and then my nightmare turned into a stupid dream about how i left my cell phone at some school and i made matt go and get it for me...and some other jazz.  My dad told me we're going to Hawaii this summer. !! delicious, i love hawaii. Except...we might be going with his girlfriend...and her kids.  not nearly as appealing.  ...  but its still Hawaii, and my sister and i have decided to run away when we get there.  I have things to do! must be off.
