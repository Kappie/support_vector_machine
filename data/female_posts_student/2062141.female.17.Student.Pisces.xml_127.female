My neighborhood is the prettiest place on earth. I can't wait to be in the sunshine state next week... I just feel so... sunny! Donald Trump has a horrible toupee. Tomorrow's the last day of school before break. I have to give out Valentines (disney princess ones... yeah baby)... I have 30 Valentines, but have only 16 candys... favoritism will be the word of the day. Journalism is the best class ever. The paper comes out tomorrow... my article is sooo long so I look like a dork but it's about rock n roll so its okay... and we get a pizza partay but I'll be so hungry by 6th period. I'm babbling. I need to pack. Josh Moore is a Whore.
