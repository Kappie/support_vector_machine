The people around me know I will always try to see their side of the story and will always hear them out.  In trying to be understanding or trying to show confidence in people's ability to change I often open myself up to being hurt again in a situation where most others would have already washed their hands of that person. I'm less vulnerable now than in the past. I take others' actions less personally now and I'm  less naive.  Sadly, I'm more detached than I used to be. 13. When is the last time you cried: Sometime within the last week. 14. When was the last time you were TRULY happy: I wish I could remember. It was almost certainly before I got married. Actually that's not fair. It's been a long time since I felt generally and all-around happy, but happy moments happen all the time. Even in the middle of 'generally' tough times. Take your happiness where you can. It all counts. 15. Have you ever thought about suicide: Yeah, when I woke up in hospital pooping out the charcoal they made me drink the night before after the paramedics found me in the middle of my living room floor.  (Yes, I had actually swallowed all the medication in my house and washed it down with at least half a bottle of port.) 16. Have you ever had an eating disorder: no. 17. Have you ever been depressed: yes, but only for eleven years. 18. What is your biggest fear: That I'll get sucked into a severe depression and it won't ever go away. That or psychosis. It would be really scary to not know for sure what is real. To not be able to trust your own senses, your own mind. 19. Have you ever had a broken heart: yes. 20. Do you ever hurt people intentionally? No. Only small animals. Is that a bad thing? 21. What is one thing you cannot stand: being lied to.
