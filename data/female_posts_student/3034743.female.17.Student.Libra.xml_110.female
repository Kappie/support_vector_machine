I cried for awhile cuz of an "event" that took place between me and Marty. Everything is ok now, and that makes me beyond happy. Hmm...not too much else has been going on. I'll blog later within the next couple of days because I'm sure I'll have more to talk about when that time comes. Why? I dunno.
