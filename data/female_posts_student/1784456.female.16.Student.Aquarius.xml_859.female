Computer's have spaces in them, to be full with information. (Uhoh, now she's going moral) Like us, I guess, we have gaps in our brains,  some larger than others Izzy  and when we learn they are filled. (WARNING: Moral overload) We have gaps for emotions, personally my evil one's full at the moment, being a evil three headed monkey isn't all fun you know, I have evil paper work to do and stuff! (Ok, so it's subsided *whatever that means* in to weirdness, well, it's normal for me!) Ahh... music relaxes me so much, nothing else does! That's why I love playing the piano... how ...interesting... I'll go hide with some orange juice! Time to drink! (God, that's hard stuff you're drinking) Yeah, but I don't care! Ha! I'm a self confessed *whatever that means too* orange juice adict! *shock* Ok, I'm seriously going bubi!
