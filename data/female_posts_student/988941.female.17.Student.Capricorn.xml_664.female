Jackie, there is a part-time position being advertised in the window of Lloyds chemist in Hamsey Green- I think that means you do after school work and the odd Saturday or something, just thought I'd tell ya! Anywho, I haven't got much to do today, meeting Paul later this afternoon and he's coming here for  the evening. Other than that trying to get a bit of work done, but not getting very far. Ttyl
