I don't want to go into detail because the whole thought of it depresses me to no end.  So I am going to try and get out of this blue stage and get on with life.  Live and learn.  Emmy's one.  She didn't get the birthday she deserved, but we are taking her to Disneyland this weekend in hopes to erase from all our minds the misfortune we encountered last week.    I will have to keep it there for now...I have a paper and two mid-terms tomorrow...wish me luck.
