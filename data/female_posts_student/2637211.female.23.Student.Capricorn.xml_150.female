The thing is, I've been an incredible slacker in the class. Like, I never bought the reader, nor have I gone to the library to check out any of the reserve books we're supposed to read. And both of the papers I wrote at the absolute last minute, and on the 1st I bamboozled the TA into giving me an A. I love it when the history TAs appreciate my skills of an artist. I have bs down to an amazingly fine art. Thank you ISIS (integrated studies in systems); those three teachers and their full on bs taught us students some impressive skills of bs. I don't think I would have done so well in college had I done traditional high school... hmm, maybe I should go back to the high school and visit those teachers and tell them how their bs class made me a better college student. Except I might say it nicer.
