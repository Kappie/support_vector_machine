I gotta vent on someone. So I'll try to vent on you people. Well theres this problem and you wanna tell this person that means a lot to you, but you cant, because you dont know how they will react. You see maybe you see this person all the time or maybe you dont hardly ever get to see them at all. The point is you just cant bring yourself to tell them. The sad part is...its eating you up inside and you dont know how to fix it, cause when you try they just snap at you, or ignore what you said, or dont even really care...what else is sad is that they dont understand that your trying to fix something thats very important to you and they arent willing to do the same thing or understand. So I guess this one thing that you wanna tell someone you cant because maybe it isnt the right time. Who knows when that will be....The point is this, you cant run from your problems forever, you cant change things only help them out, you cant say you want to do something about them and miss every chance just because your scared. I guess there are just not enough brave people in the world and not enough to stand up for the ones who arent. But there is one person in the whole situation that I would like to thank for all of there help. The characters will soon know who they are in life, what postition you where ment to play, and who you really are inside.
