It's hard to be happy for someone when you're in such a crappy mood, and you just want to tell them to shut up, and you feel reallllly bad for that. OK, maybe that's just me, but that's how it is with me. It's like, "why can't I be in a mood like yours?"   Ah well, I guess I really need to stop wishing stuff and face reality. But reality apparently doesn't like me much. Well, of course it does, just not in some subjects. Relationship wise, life hates me with a deep fiery burning passion that eats away at it's soul. But really, that's the only way reality doesn't like me.   I should just go and stop wallowing in self pity. Everything is great, right? So I don't have a boyfriend, big deal. So what? So people don't like me? Who cares. I've got myself, and I always will. Take that reality.
