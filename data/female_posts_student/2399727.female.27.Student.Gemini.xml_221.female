I finished in time for SO and watched half of that before heading over to church.  I was somewhat surprised D. was celebrant given he’s only a half-timer now; thought he’d hang out at the chaplaincy more.  Saw T. in his new role and he gave me a cute little wave before he went over to his box for the first time.  Had to be the first time; he got stuck in the door, got twisted up in the curtain and otherwise looked pretty damned funny!  The episode only lasted but a split second before he laughed, unfurled himself and motioned for the first penitent to come inside.   I’m terrified to go to him in that role; I think I shall hold out for one of the other three.  Woke up to obscene emails from pp from last night.  Glad I didn’t see those before I went to sleep or I would have had horrible nightmares.  Later, CALSS; talked mainly about my eyes and “who am I?”  Basically, how I’m defining myself now and giving the disability too much weight.  As part of my homework, I went back through all of my blog entries and found the number of times I have mentioned my disability since November.  80% of the July entries include it (probably 90% with today’s!), and low months of February and May.  Other months are about 20-30%.  Stopped at Harbord Bakery for some bread for a spontaneous lunch tomorrow; I’m going to be the recipient of some homemade strawberry jam so I thought I’d bring something to show my appreciation.  Had a sub for dinner; didn’t feel like cooking.  Don’t feel like doing much, actually.  Just got an email from Germany that my Robert Schumann biography page translated into German by Google is horrible.  Well, gee, since I didn’t translate it, I can’t take responsibility for their automatic computer programmed translator.  Just be grateful that there is a translation facility available at all, smart ass.  Back to work now; I want to be finished for The Amazing Race 5 at 9:30pm!  Woo hoo!  More to come…
