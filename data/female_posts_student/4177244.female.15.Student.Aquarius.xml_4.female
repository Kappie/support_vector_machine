It's gonna be    c  r a z   y  , and I'm almost  positive  that I won't come back to update this, but I'm giving it a try. I'm going to use it for my views on things, not for telling about my day.  To start off, I'm going to list  20 random things  about me.   I'm really shy, but there are ways you can contact my outgoing side.  I'm easily annoyed.  I'm all for making new friends, but there are certain kinds of people that I just cannot tolerate. These people include: Smokers, alcoholics, drug users, those pro-teenage-sex, and people who make me uncomfortable. Theres probably others, but I'm tired.  I love to read. Especially books that I relate to. But I'll read anything from Sci-Fi to romance.  I'm overly organized. Everything has to be just in it's place or I'm not happy.  I am overweight, but not nearly as much as I was in late December. I actually succeeded in my New Years resolution and have already lost over 20 pounds.  Speaking of reading (Random Fact #4), I found  urlLink www.blogger.com  because I was reading Meg Cabot's diary, on HER site,  urlLink www.megcabot.com .  I've had  six  boyfriends, but three of them were internet boys, so they don't count.  I like to think that I'm smart, kind,  down-to-earth , and I have a great sense of humor, but I'm sure that comes across as way conceited. So when I talk to people, I never say what I like about myself, which are those qualities.  I love to go shopping, but only if I have money. Otherwise I feel sorry for myself because I can't have all of those wonderful things.  I have a gorgeous cat named Whiskers. He's getting old. I also have a turtle named Patrick.  My best friends are  Julie ,  Ashley , and  Jennifer .  Theres a staff day (no school) on February 2nd for this coming school year, the same day that happens to be my birthday. It's those kind of things that keep you going with your Christian faith (which I have). (BTW- That was like three things about me in one, eh?).  My favorite movies are: The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Win a Date with Tad Hamilton.  My favorite books are: The Guardian, A Bend in the Road, the 1-800-Where-R-You series, and the  Princess Diaries  series.  Writing is fun. I have two books underway right now, and quite a few already finished. The ones I have underway are called "Discovering Each Other," and "Her Secret Wish."  Music  Laughter are my best medicine. Reading  Writing are my escape.  I love a good cry. Sometimes people tell me that I cry too much, but what do they know? I barely cry in public and I only cry when something really touches me (positively or negatively). And theres nothing wrong with crying, anyway. So *Sticks out tongue*  I love to float in the pool for hours.  I am me. If you don't like it, don't read this.
