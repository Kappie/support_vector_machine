We went out to Copper Canyon to volunteer at Rabbit Rescue (keep in mind it's a 45-minute drive or so), and when we got there, nobody was friggin' home. Diana, who's the owner of the place, knew we were coming, but stil there was nobody there. We hung around for about 30 minutes but nobody showed up so we left. Grrr.  Thanks to  urlLink humanforsale.com , I now know how much I'm worth. I also know that I'm worth more as a chick, because if I were a guy I'd be worth exactly $1,693,022.00. Ha!    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  in pain, my stomach hurts  listening to/watching ::  nothing *gasp!*  eating/drinking ::  chewing orbit  craving ::  nothing really  talking to ::  nobody  thinking about ::  candy...*wink*  wishing ::  that somebody had been home so I could've helped w/the rabbits  wearing ::  capris and an old red t-shirt  random ::  I love to shop.
