Went to Lainie's around 12:30, hung out there until 4, went home quick, went to Sarah's to pick up pics of Derek, picked up Beth, went over to Robert's, then we went to Winner's Deli to visit Jamie. By then it was like, 5, so we went to the fair and waited for Mande and Lainie to meet up w/ us. WE got piggy tattoos at the Mercy tent, and Robert and I went on the bungee thing. That was awesome. Then Mande and Lainie got there and we went on the Tilt-a-Whirl, then me, Robert, Beth, and Mande went on the Fireball, which was awesome. Then Robert left, and we went and got drinks and stuff, and walked around to all the tents collecting as many stickers as we could. That was cool. Then we went on some more rides and Robert came back and went on some more, then we played the coin game for a little while. We lost Bethy's glasses somewhere... I feel really bad, b/c it's kinda my fault b/c I'm the one that adjusted the hat and knocked them off...  But anyway... we left around 10:30, and Me, Robert, and Beth went back to Robert's. This is where all the fun partying started..... Ordered pizza, and Richie, Andy, Jake, and Derek/Miller Time came over. Derek's cool, Hat Guy/Brian isn't. We played a game of Fuck You. Derek and Jake kept fucking me... I only had to beer bong once during the game, then I did another one later on (which, by the way, I did in like... 3 secs. Robert said stop and I didn't understand what he was talking about, b/c I didn't see how I could be finished already...). I played Duck Hunt, which was cool, b/c I haven't played that in awhile. I sucked at it though... oh well... We played tag in the back yard... Drunken tag is fun, b/c you can't run very well and everyone trips and falls all the time... Except Robert was chasing me and I fell and he tripped over me and landed right on my leg... That hurt like a bitch, then I couldn't walk, so Richie put ice on it, and they carried me inside. So then Richie and I layed on the couch and he put ice on it and we both fell asleep there. And... yeah, Lainie I want to talk to you again about the Richie stuff, b/c... idk, I still have to talk to Robert, but... Anyway, Beth and I left around 8 then fell asleep at her house. Around 11 something mom called me and started bitching me out. Apparently she didn't know I wasn't coming home last night. Wtf? I told her several times... Anyway, then I told her I didn't think I'd be able to take grandma shopping today b/c of my leg, and she yelled at me b/c apparently I should've come home when it happened so she could take me to the hospital. Never mind that it was 3 in the morning, the only thing that was open was the ER, and she probably wouldn't have taken me anyway... I failed to mention to her that I couldn't have driven home anyway b/c I was drunk, but you know... Then she gave me a list of things to do and told me to be home by 12...  Anyway... I got home, slept some, showered, did my chores, called grandma and told her I'd take her to the store tomorrow, then I fell asleep again. Woke up at 9, made some Ramen, Ken texted me so I was texting him back and forth, then I sat in my room until mom left at 11 and now I'm here... I don't really know where she's going, nor do I care, but at least I can get on the comp... w/e... I'm gonna go play some games and read everyone's blogs...
