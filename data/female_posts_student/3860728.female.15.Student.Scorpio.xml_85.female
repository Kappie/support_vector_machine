I think i'll try chocolate tomorrow although i'm a little worried about my throat itching as it is at the moment. My mom has gone to the store. I asked her to pick me up a calling card. She reluctanley agreed so i can call my ASHELY. Hmmmmm.... i tried calling Amber, but no body answered her cell phone or home phone number... tis all for now.
