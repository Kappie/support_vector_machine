You may have noted that America originally entered Iraq claiming that they aimed to rid it of offensive nuclear weaponary. After realising that there were no nuclear warheads in the first place, America changed excuses, now claiming that they aimed to liberate the Iraqis from a cruel and torturous regime... You may have realised that this American reasoning has dissapeared after the discovery of American cruelty against Abu Ghraib prisoners. So think to yourself... what's the next excuse these hypocritical bastards will make for their occupation of Iraq?   From Kit... have a good long weekend
