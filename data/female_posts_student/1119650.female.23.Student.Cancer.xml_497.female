So here it is in all its glory, my new year's resolution:  I am going to be a positive, successful and accomplished person.  It seems lofty, and frankly I'm a little scared of it myself, but I can and  will  do it.  I learned a few very valuable lessons this year and I want to share them with you so that you guys can reach your own personal goals and aspirations for 2004 (sorry if this seems preachy).  1)  Words give things power.   If you say negative things consistently then you will be awash in a sea of negativity and in turn only attract negative people (opposite attraction generally only works for magnets).  Conversely, if you set a list of goals for yourself and want to accomplish some positive things.  Write them down, read them to yourself once or twice a day, really focus on them.  Allow your words to give your goals power.    2) Winners win, because they're willing to do what losers aren't.   Sounds simple and stupid right?  Right!  Its that easy to make a change though, pick up the slack where someone drops it, even if no one else is doing it, you'll advance yourself further and while it may not pay off immediately, trust me, people will notice that you're willing get stuff done and by time they realize it works, you'll be leaps and bounds ahead of them.  3) If you're not growing, you're dying.   Make yourself better.  Read for 30 minutes a day, get up at the same time everyday just to establish a habbit, hit the gym even though you  really  don't want to.  Once you start doing this stuff enough it will become second nature to you and the tasks you've set for yourself that seemed impossible and unattainable will become closer and easier to reach because you're thinking positively and going and growing in the right direction.  We all have the inner potential to be that amazing person with the great carreer, family life and social life who is always making positive changes and positive things happen who we all envy and just wonder how they do it, all we have to do is tap into it and if we all grow just a little bit we'll unlock part of ourselves that will allow us to reach that potential.  4) Look out for yourself and take care of yourself, even spoil yourself, if you don't chances are no one else will either.   Its good to reward yourself for the small progresses you make.  Set goals and measure yourself against them.  Even though you'll already have the plus of reaching a goal, you can give yourself a small incentive to get rolling on the rest of your tasks you've set.  5) A positive outlook goes a long way.   Sure, people are gonna look at you funny at first, but I promise you, positivity catches on.  If you want to surround yourself with a good growing environment just emit positivity, its like a pebble in a pond, eventually it will ripple out.  6) Don't be a "should-head"   "I Should do this...."  "I should do that..." JUST DO IT!  Let me put it in nerdier terms for those of you who are in touch with your inner geeks:  "Do or do not, there is no try".  Finally, I encourage you all to pick up a book called  Reach Your True Potential: How to Overcome Self-Defeating Behavior  by Sheri Zampelli, it will change some of your lives.  Laugh at me if you wish, but these are my honest goals for the year that is rapidly approaching.  I've sold out to the power of self improvement and I guess this is my first step towards seeing if it really works.  I have 8 more days of bitching and moaning left for the year so buckle your seatbelts for that, but after January 1st I'm going to try and turn over a new leaf.    See ya on the flipside, kids!
