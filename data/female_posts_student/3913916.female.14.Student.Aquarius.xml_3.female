I miss you after I see you, how much more if I see you never. I miss you now how much more later..."   Katrina Santos. Rachel Casis. JM Ochangco. Rosemae Rubio. Patrick Deyto. Leonette Gonzaga. Jessica Carlos. Rina Villar. Larson Smit. Joseph Castro. and everybody else! I miss them all. Some were really my closest friends, even best friends, some were just friends. All the moments we had, all our laughter we shared together, the getting-to-know-you days, and every memory. I miss them all; I miss that all. I want to talk to them again; befriend them again; bond with them; and laugh and talk to them. If I could just turn back time, I'll really do something about this - like always talk to them, just by saying HI is enough. All I want is to bring back all the memories we had. Sigh. Even those people I still get to talk to, I still miss them coz before we had that bonding, but now, our friendship isn't that stronger. People like... Pielle Pacifico. Judd Antonio. Norman Riego. Yvana Carangan. Michael Kalalo. etc. etc. So now, I've made a promise to myself that I will keep all the friends I have now and still make new ones.
