Well I think I have figured why! I have been wearing this necklcae which is a happy face which I got free as a gift from the Hard Rock Hotel I stayed in. I'm always happy when I wear it. Check my hotel out  urlLink here !! Its was so awesome, the swimming pool has an underwater sound system and every few nights they have like a DJ at the pool or a dive-in movie/concert. They showed Harry Potter when I was there. Excellent. Love it!!!
