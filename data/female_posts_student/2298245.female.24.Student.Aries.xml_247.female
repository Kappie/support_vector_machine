I've never worked so hard on writing anything in my life, and depsite that icky hangover feeling I have from lack of sleep, I feel kind of good about it.  Perhaps I can relax a little now.  At least I can relax about it - going in and fixing the problems that I know exist with it will not be too daunting a task, even with exams looming just over the horizon.  Today, I am going to try and relax as much as possible, but there is no rest for the weary as they say.  I've got to go to school, and for the second day in a row, my commute there will likely be longer than the time I actually spend there.  Well, actually, that's probably not true of today, but it certainly was yesterday.  But that's what happens when you put things off until the last minute.  So, my paper is done.  It's not that there weren't bumps along the way.  I finished just shy of 3 AM.  Would have been done sooner, but I hit a series of setbacks.  First, my computer froze and I feared loss of my draft or at least significant portions of it.  But God was with me so all was fine.  Then, the internet stopped working, so I could no longer conduct the research I needed to finish my paper.  But it finally came back on, and I got back to work.   I don't feel as elated as I thought I would, but I'm going to chalk that up to the fact that I am many other daunting tasks still to complete.  But I can at least relax a little bit this weekend, and that's a very good thing.
