When there are two left turn lanes, with a double white line that separates where each car is supposed to go, but the car next to you just turns into your lane anyways. Especially when it's a minivan with bumper stickers saying, "My Kid is on the Honor Roll at Some Urban Piece-of-Shit School in the middle of Nowhere". Why do they do that? Why don't you just kill your precious baby, you ass wipe? I hate minivans! I've been babysitting a lot, it's weird, I have no purpose for my money anymore and I don't know what to do with it. I keep putting it in my "Texas or Bust" fund, which is no longer a fund. P.S. When we were on the trip, I saw a minivan (gag) that had "Texas or Bust" written on its windows-what's up with that? I saw  Fahrenheit 9/11  the other day. So damn good, well I cried a little. Some of those soldiers were ass wipes, and I was pissed off at them. I was talking to Liz about Mae and the whole Dave sounds like Big Bird thing. Then I started to think about Big Bird.  This is a total blonde moment: Me: "Big Bird doesn't even look like a bird!" Liz: "Yes he does!" Me: "No, birds aren't that big." Liz: "Dude, he's BIG bird!"  That was pathetic, I know.   My feet have been smelling really bad lately. I washed them three times while babysitting, because I couldn't take the smell, and yet they still stink. Maybe I'll go wash them again.
