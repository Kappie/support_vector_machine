Today is Easter, the day that some religious thing happened so now we celebrate. I don't understand, probably never will, and honestly don't really care to know.  My favoritest aunt is here. She keeps beating me over the head with questions about the love life.  I flung a pig at my dad's head with a spoon. Now that is what I call "Holiday Entertainment."  The Easter Bunny didn't visit my house this year... but hey, Santa never showed either, so why should I expect some faggy bunny to give me candy and such?   Sigh...
