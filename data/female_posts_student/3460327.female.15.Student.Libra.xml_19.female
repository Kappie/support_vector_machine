To see you hurt   To see you cry,   Makes me weep   I wanna die.   And if you agree   To never fight,   It wouldn't matter   Who's wrong or right.   If a broken heart   Needs a mend,   I'll be right there   To the end.   If your cheeks are wet   From drops of tears,   Don't you worry,   Let go of your fears.   Hand in hand   Love is sent,   We'll be friends   Till the end...  ...everytime i read this poem,i'll definitely laugh to myself.i have one stupid friend who claimed he wrote this poem that he slept at 4 o'clock in the morning to finish it or so.and ironically,i believed him.until i came across the same thing at a website.  fcuk off  la cuz i hate him so much i have no pity to spit to his face.
