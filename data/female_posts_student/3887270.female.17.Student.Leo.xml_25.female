"Girl's aren't supposed to go out" WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN!? so what do i do? i stay home. what do i do at home? "clean the house, wash the dishes, vaccuum the house, dust the house, fold the laundry, do the laundry..." why don't i just do EVERYTHING, while my brother is out god knows where, and while my sister stays in her room and goes on her laptop 24/7, and does absolutely nothing?? now you know...now you know why, i go out, when they're not home..
