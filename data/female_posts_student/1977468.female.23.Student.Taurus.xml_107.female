But I'm typing this anyway, which is okay. What better a post then the 100th post to show that I'm not perfect? I can't always be witty or genius. The next big post will be the 1000th post... which... at my current rate, will be 10 years. If I ever go that long, I pray it means I'm still not living at home. If I am living at home it should be for a good reason. Like my own house burnt down with my whole family inside, and so I'm a male widow. Then no one would poke fun at me. I wouldn't be so self concious.  I made a quiz for you guys:     Take my Quiz on QuizYourFriends.com!     I hope you enjoy it.   I went to the beach last weekend. Here's some quotes from the trip.  "No. Your all my bitches, now shut up." - Eric  "We're going to portland right? The beachhouse is in portland?" - Nick  "'Safeway is open 24/7, I thought.' -brandon 'Your MOM is open 24/7!" - My first good mom joke ever. A passing into true manhood.  Joe and Brandon went too, but I don't have quotes for them. The only things I can remember Joe saying are not repeatable in good taste. Brandon... I can't remember what he said that wasn't whining. Here's something.  "Why I am always the pervert? Listen to Joe! And I'm not short, not after junior year." Brandon "Shut up, pervert!" Eric "Eric, its not he's fault he's perverted. He's short." Me  Eric ran around like a girl. Thats not a put down to women, I say that because he was screaming and pleading in his falsetto. Most girls don't even do that. It was because Brandon brought an airsoft gun, and Eric wanted to know how it felt to be shot. So Brandon was loading it and Eric changed his mind. So we chased him, naturally.  There was a stand off between us and Joe. When we got bored we'd go lynching people with the airsoft gun, usually whoever wasn't there at the moment to argue. Thats why it was dangerous to wander off by yourself.  Joe locked himself in the bath room for about an hour. We waited outside and turned all the lights off. It was pretty interesting, you'd've had to been there to know.  Oh yeah, I started my novella. It's good so far.  Bye bye.
