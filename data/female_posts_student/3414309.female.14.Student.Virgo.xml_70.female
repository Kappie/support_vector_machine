DOOM !!! the closet says naughty things lol ... it says wut me and my friends truly think about people.   and ofcourse since i am infact meri anderson and i do have the worst luck of anyone i know - my mom is going to look at the closet.   when she gets home. in 2 hours. to me - the closet is a work of art - the thoughts, drawings, and love portrayed through the closet are   truly moving. to mommy - she'll freak. so i guess you could say i'm a bit worried. but i LOVE the closet i love love love it.   and i'm quite positive that if you asked any of my friends they in turn would say they love the closet. so maybe i'm wrong - maybe mommy will see the closet as a work of art as i do -   or maybe she'll freak out the butt. we'll just have to see. lololol. cleaning the closet is actually fun. i'm just clearin out the crap and vaccuuming it ... i'm also   re-setting up the candles and making a "signing station" so that we will never be without a writin utensil while in the closet.   sigh. i am going to go now though ... to clean the closet ... o beloved closet. please everyone pray for the closet ... or that mommy has dust in her eyes and doesnt read the walls.   amen.        ~Dee~      *****       :-D
