It's like, I like country only which means it is not possible to enjoy a song catagorized as rock. Just because a song isn't the "genre" you like doesn't mean it isn't good. What exactly is a genre, anyways? It's not like there's a song on this planet that really fits into one seperate catagory. Well, I'll eat my words; any of Britney Spear's songs can be classified as pop and only pop. However, take the song I'm listening to right now: I Feel Fine by Riddlin Kids. If you've ever heard this song, you would know that it isn't exactly punk, rock, or alternative. It certainly isn't pop or hip-hop. So what does that make it? It makes it whatever you, as an individual, decide that it is. Just because I don't think it sounds punk doesn't mean the next person that comes along won't.   Another thing is when people say oh, I like such-and-such band, they're so [instert genre description here]. Let me ask you something. Have you ever, ever heard a band in which every single on of their songs sounds like it could be in the same genre? Here's an example. I love the Black Eyed Peas. Their sound is edgy, fun, and samples a little from a lot of genres. The one genre you would normally never associate with the Peas - other than country, that is; forget country music even exsists for the purpose of this article because I honestly do not like country music and I also honestly believe it is possible the only classifiable kind of music - is rock. Well, I bought their CD the other day and was incredibly surprised to find that song eleven, Anxiety, is actually a rock-out, crank-it-up, kick-ass song. As it turns out, its my favorite song on the CD, maybe for the simple reason that it was unexpected. So now, I can't really say B.E.P. is funk or whatever, because I now that they aren't always that specific genre. A person hearing Anxiety as their first Black Eyed Peas song would assume that the Peas are hard rock, possibly alternative. However, a person hearing Where Is the Love as the first B.E.P. song they've heard would assume that they're pure pop. So you really can't define a band by the music they play.  Music is possibly the one thing this world agrees on: it's good. What nobody seems to agree on is what kind of music is best, what genre such and such band is, what music needs more good songs, and so on and so on. It's a perfect subject for debates, conversations, bonding. When you really think about it, this world revolves around music. Without, think how many things would cease to exsist. Fan clubs, the radio, a ton of websites, MTV (well...or not), the Grammys. However, there's a possibilty that a lot of violence would go away as well. Take Eminem's Sing for the Music, which says, "They say music can alter moods and talk to you, but can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?" All of this is very true. Critics blame the man himself, Eminem, for a lot of this world's violence problems. Or at the very least they blame the angry lyrics in his songs. But we have to ask ourselves, if we know the music is going to effect us how it is, why do we listen to it? The reason is that the music is everywhere we go. It is impossible to get away from music. Music is everywhere. It's like oxygen for your ears, except that only the most extreme cases will ever die from lack of music. So why bother trying to classify it, or stick a lable on it? Music is music, and if that's all you did all day - put this song into this genre and that song into that genre - you would have no life and you just wouldn't  enjoy  the music. Isn't that the whole point?
