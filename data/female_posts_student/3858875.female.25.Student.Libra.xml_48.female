I really really hope that they don't have any more substantive revisions, but only a few word choices/typos/awkward phrasings. writing the last few paragraphs in the conclusion felt like drawing blood from a stone.  i still haven't found a new hairdresser - was waiting until my meeting on friday to get my hair snipped. i think i'm going to have quite a lot taken off.   learned a new word today: austintatious! cheesy, eh? a prospective roommate emailed me and used it. he also said basically nothing nice about where he lives except that it's on the bus route to UT and has a nice pool. a lot of places i've found advertised are in these gated apartment communities for students. what do students, of all people, need to be protected from? roommate searching is so much fun...
