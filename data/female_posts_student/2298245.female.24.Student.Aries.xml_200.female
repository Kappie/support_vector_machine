It was helped greatly by the presence of Gary Cole - which was a nice surprise.  Also ate some pizza, talked some politics, and had an all around fun evening.  Now, I'm polishing off the rest of the ice-cream, and then it's to bed.  Oh, and I watched  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington  today, and quickly reaffirmed my deep and abiding love for Claude Raines.  One of these days, perhaps I will mount a semi-spirited defense of his character in the movie.  But not today.
