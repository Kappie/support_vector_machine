And well its finally summer and i had been looking forward to it up until the last week of june...this guy i had been really good friends wit for a year..and we'd finally started saying i love you in january cuz he realized he "loved" me during xmas break, well he started acting different. He lives in another state but i kno him thru his cousin, and i mean we were realllllly close (notice the "were" part) and we dated for a month back in march but i broke it off saying it was meaningless cuz we never get to see each other..and he understood, no hard feelings. So i was all stressed out the end of may beginning of june cuz of finals, my first time taking them, and i had told him i might act a lil distant cuz of having my head off thinking about those and he was so cute about it, hes like well i'll try and make u as happy as i can..i was like awh thanx...so finaly im done wit finals all the stress is somewhat gone, cuz i still didn't kno my grade, and i had to go away a few days after i got outa school for my brothers graduation..then right when i got hom i went away for a week wit a friend for a lil vacation..which i needed SO much...and i usually questioned my relationship wit this guy just cuz well he was such a sweetheart but i never knew if i really loved him cuz he was my first love so i wasn't used to the feeling...so during this trip my head was clear and i thought it all out and i was positive i loved this guy, and i had been wanting to tell him exactly how much he meant to me but my head was all over the place and i wanted to do it at a good time so i decided to wait...when i got back from my trip he was acting a lil different..but i figured it was just cuz he had been busy that whole week and stuff...then he told me how he had a fight wit one my friends about how much i mean to him, and how he would do anyhting for me..and i was like awhh really and hes like hell yea! and me and him usually talk till like 2 in the morning but we started kinda not having much to say..our convos were somewhat dead...then a few days later he was like alright i've lost my feelings for you...back a lil before school ended i thought u lost ur feelings for me so i silently delt wit it and lost mine for you, and i didn't bring it up...hes like and u were away so i wasn't sure exactly how u did feel towards me...then when u were wit ur friend i kinda started to like another girl..nothing serious..but mainly what i want to say is..i don't love you anymore...(okay u can go to the next post for the rest of this bullshit)
