Apart from I'm still anemic girl so we're gonna have to be wimpy and go and see a film! Yeay! Oh, and I'm gonna get Lynne a birthday prezzie! Yeay! Hmm... maybe I should dry my hair! Aargh, I'm running out of tops, they're all in the wash and I need them! I've worn the same top for two days! (Oh no! Shocking) Yeah, ain't it? On holiday my brother had the same pair of pants on for like all of the holiday and he only wore two shirts and some shorts! That's what Glastonbury does to you! Mind you, my brother doesn't really care about that kind of thing and it's starting to rub off on me! Aaargh! Is it me or is it freezing today? Okay, anemia kicking in fun! Better go put a jumper on, geez, every one else is gonna be wearing like summer stuff and I'm gonna be their in full winter wear!
