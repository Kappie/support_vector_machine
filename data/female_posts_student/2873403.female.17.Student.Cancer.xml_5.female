That's a warning to you, you piece of crap pile of metal and plastic they call technology.  This whole Me and Nick not hanging out thing is getting slightly retarded. Sort of like this blog. Yesterday we didn't hang out because I got home way later than expected, and now today his parents have dragged him off to the mall. It sucks. Hardcore. Oh well. Friday night was movie night at Amy's. We had a whole bunch of movies picked out to watch and Courtney was supposed to come join us but she had to stay home and babysit her brothers. So me and Amy made some Jello Jigglers and watched half of "The Shining" before falling asleep. It wasn't the original Jack Nicholson version of "The Shining." It was the remake from the 90's, where the guy uses a croquet mallet instead of an ax. It was sort of funny actually. Except for that whole bunny topiary thing. That was friggin creepy. I would be scared shitless if a bush shaped like a bunny came after me. I really would.  Saturday, we woke up way to early at like 7 am. Then we had waffles and finished watching the movie, then we watched the Muppet Movie. Then we got ready to go shopping and I made my hair all gross and curly and wore weird shiny bluish greenish eyeshadow. It was awesome. I looked all girly and whatnot. Then I went through Amy's closet and found a random belt and her old school Euclid School t-shirt. Then we found her old Euclid School sweatshirt from when she was in like kindergarten that doesn't fit her anymore but of course fits tiny Danielle. So w00t, I have this awesome sweatshirt now.  Later on, we were sitting downstairs and listening to random ska music and shitty hip hop waiting for her mom to come home from work, when the doorbell rings. Its my sister Steve. I told her to go home. So she got back in the car where my mom was waiting and I followed her and asked why they were there and they said they didn't know so they left. It was strange.  Finally Amy's mom came home and we left. We listened to some random 90's music on the way to Middletown, and suddenly, Hootie comes on the radio. We have decided that Hootie is due for a comeback. All these other crappy artists are making comebacks, but only Hootie is worthy. We'd so buy all the new albums if the Blowfish came back.    The Shopping Experience with Amy and Danielle:   *I made Amy buy a skirt. *I got a belt. Its green and orange and blue. It was on these shorts but we didn't want the shorts so we just switched the belt with the really weird ugly one that was on the skirt. *I tried on this obnoxious skirt that looked like it wanted to eat my body. It was so disgustingly awesomely ugly. It was all purple and pink with random black spots on it. It was great. *People looked at us weird. This is not unusual. People always look at us weird when we go out in public.   Good times. On the way home we could find nothing but Linkin Park on the radio. It was horrible. We made it good though by singing crazy 2-part harmonies, and making up our own awesomely bad lyrics, because well, we're awesomely bad like that.  Oh yeah I also borrowed Amy's Brave Little Toaster movies because they are the greatest things ever. And now I am going to watch them. Goodbye.
