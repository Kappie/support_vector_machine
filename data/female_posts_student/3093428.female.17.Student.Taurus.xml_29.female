Anywho, i was suposed to go visit the crew at McRoberts but because of studying and other things, cumincations got mixed up so here I am at home. If only I had my car...  Yay! Anne is in, now, we need to get Dyllan...yes Dyllan...So my damn Drama teachers weren't there so i didn't get my Bye Bye Birdie video. What robbery...Technology does suck too!!!
