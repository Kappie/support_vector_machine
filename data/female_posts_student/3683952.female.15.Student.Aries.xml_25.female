Since they were specially chosen by God to be my parents, i know that i'll be able to go thru all things. Thnk God. :) was really blessed during BS. yay!!!!!!!! laying foundation le. hehe. BS was about fatherhood. in the midst of BS i realised that ever since i bcame a christian, God has really moulded me into a different person. I realised that though my parents couldn't fulfill my emotional needs.. (its partly bcauz i couldn't open up to them myself.) i know my heavenly father can always make me feel significant, self worthy and he always make me feel special. :) 2dae's service was incredible and unbelievable. i couldn't stop crying...i was practically weeping. today, i realised that i'm actually very sensitive to the spirit. when i see people getting touched my God, and when i see their pain. My heart will juz cry for them. Think i cried so much 2dae is partly bcauz of the pain in my heart and the love of God working through me and also a portion goes out to those ppl whose hearts are so deeply burden. but thank God!!!! after 2dae's svc we've all been set free!!!!!!!! Amen? hehe. We are all ppl that break free!!!!!!! Thnk God for God... bcauz without him... i wouldn't be able to go through this day.  -*with his love*-
