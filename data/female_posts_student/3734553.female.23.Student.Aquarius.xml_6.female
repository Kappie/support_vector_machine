I know I've lead a sheltered life. But I just don't understand how some people could be so mean.It seems like it would be hard to live with yourself if you did certain things. Always wondering in your head, if sooner or later, your actions would catch up to you. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Easier said, than done.     And things could always be worse...
