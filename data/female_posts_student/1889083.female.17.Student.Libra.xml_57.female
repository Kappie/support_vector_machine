I'll write abt it when I dun hv enuff time.. =) its gonna be a yr since I last broke up wif J.. dun exactly remember e date when we broke up.. only know its in august.. nearing promos.. I wonder.. how did I managed to survive/struggle thru dis ordeal.. dis misery.. dis hurt tt had carved so deep in my heart.. how did I pull thru.. how did I managed to get by.. during e past yr when she's not wif me.. did I really become a better person? happier? am I who I want to be... I dun really know.. when she's not wif me.. I feel empty.. I feel alone.. I dun feel love.. I dun hv faith.. I dun hv trust.. I've lost motivation in almost everything.. I feel like I've lost it all.. frankly.. e past yr.. was indeed a torture to me.. e misery was so intense.. never a moment was I not sad.. even when I win matches.. she's not there to share my joy.. which made me feel incomplete.. sigh.. I feel incomplete.. no matter how hard I work.. no matter wad I've acheived.. I've always hoped tt she will be there to share wif me everything.. but she's not.. when she's wif me.. I feel love.. I feel happiness every now n den.. even when I had my lousiest ball day.. gotten e worst results in e class.. I wun giv a shit.. cos she's there.. jus to see her will brighten up my day.. will mk every disappointment n sorrow disappear.. n jus mk me feel.. so happy.. n without fear.. sigh.. but she's no longer there.. truly, I miss  her ..
