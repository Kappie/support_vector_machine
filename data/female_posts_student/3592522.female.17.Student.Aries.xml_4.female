I hate the way you play with me,  Throwing myself at your feet,  Trying so hard to change...  Do you even care?   I hate the way you're there for me,  when i'm scared, hurt or alone,  I'm trying not to feel for you,  ..it's only getting easier.   Each day i'm played a little,  a hug here, a push away there,  your confusion only hurts me,  i just want another chance.   What do i have to do,  to only make you see?  "give it a little time"  i say: "have a little faith"   I hate how i feel like a fool,  I want to make you happy,  I have to think of myself,  And i hate letting go.
