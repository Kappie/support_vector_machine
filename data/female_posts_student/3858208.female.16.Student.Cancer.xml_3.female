I've been online this whole time (since about 10:30pm). M would be pissed if they knew, but they don't even know this blog exsists. I guess it wouldn't help that I'm not even supposed to be online on my computer, since I can't hear the phone if it rings. Oh well, I really doubt anyone will be calling at nearly 4am anyways.  Right now I'm watching a show on TBS about some black family (said in a completely nonracist tone). I don't have the slightest idea what it is, but it's the only thing on right now. Well, except slutty music videos, but I'd much rather listen to WinAmp, thank you.  I really should go to bed.  Why don't I just go to bed?  Because I want to be able to say that at least once during the summer I stayed up so late that it ventured into no-man's land, into the territory of college students, truck drivers, and drunks. Ha!  Why do they call it no-man's land?  And who the fukk is they?    RIGHT NOW     mood ::   almost  tired  listening to/watching ::  WinAmp playlist - Christina Aguilera's Dirrty  eating/drinking ::  just had some tortilla chips, am still hungry  talking to ::  nobody! it's 4am!  thinking about ::  uhhhh brain. devoid. of thought.  wishing ::  that ****** would call!  wearing ::  same thing as last post, ha.
