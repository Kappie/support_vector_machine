(but hey, my mum promised me a treat.)  then we went home, and my mum took me out for an ice cream. then we sat in the parking lot for like half an hour just talking...it was really sweet.  then, on the way home, we drove past you-know-who (guy who takes my bus)...wow i like had a heart attack...but secretly, so my mum wouldn't know. then we got home, and now i'm on msn. exciting, eh? yes. very.  so tomorrow, my mum's taking me shopping for stuff for england...i.e. a raincoat, socks...yeah. should be sweet...?  "oh my god. avril lavigne is going out with the lead singer of sum 41."-me "...is that a bad thing?"-my mum "uh yes. he's too good for her."-me "are you saying that it would be better if  you  were going out with him?"-my mum "...uh yes. i mean...no..."-me  "let's just sit here and watch the world go by."-my mum  well, that's all folks.  i think that the truth is, i'm everything i hate.  kayte.  p.s. 18 days!
