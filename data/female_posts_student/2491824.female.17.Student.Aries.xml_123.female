I'd love to upload my art...  ....A dark room would be sweet also.. I wish I could control that aspect of my photos...  ..As soon as I get my own house, I'm making a dark room. :)  Oh! My pointillism picture that I did in my Drawing class was put on the bullentin board... That's the first time since elementary school that a teacher has showed off my work... (Well, Ms. Carney--in junior high--took some of my stuff to art shows and the Fine Arts Festival, but those weren't in school, so I couldn't point to it and be like, "Ha, That's mine!"...)  I'm really surprised it was put up there... A few minutes after I started it, I stopped trying to make it look good...because... pointillism sucks... :\
