I see couples embracing one another and I want what they have...the happiness and the thrill of new love, the youth and beauty of it all. At the same time I want to stay in a safety zone, all because I remember the day my heart was crumpled and thrown away like a piece of trash. I'm not sure if someone will retrieve it, as much as I hope for that to happen one day.  And then again, I'm not sure that I want them to.
