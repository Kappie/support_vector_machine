We took the them to Ye Olde York where there where street performers trying to get out of straight jackets....which tells you alot about the state of peoples minds. After hours of nothing except walking we finally came home.      Should be a better day tomorrow as i see my two bitches, 'twin of Fin' Roisin and Peewee. And hopefully Trina..but bless her...she's not aloud out often.Poor lass.    Ive had Maroon 5 songs stuck in my head allllllllll day!Argh.    Anyhoo: When i got back home i completed a quiz that tells you which video character you would be. It said i would be Mario, but then underneath it said 'if you are not Mario then you would be Mr Do...'. Who the hell is Mr Do? Which bloomin character am i? I will let you choose;          urlLink   I am  Mario .   I like to jump around, and would lead a fairly serene and aimless existence if it weren't for my friends always getting into trouble. I love to help out, even when it puts me at risk. I seem to make friends with people who just can't stay out of trouble.  urlLink What Video Game Character Are You?               urlLink   I am  Mr Do .   I am sedentary by nature, enjoying passive entertainment, eating when the mood takes me, and playing with my food. I try to avoid conflict, but when I'm angered, I can be a devil - if you force me to fight, I will crush you. With apples.  urlLink What Video Game Character Are You?           Hmmmmmmmm.Interesting.      For now, Goodbyb!             Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
