Er det ik bare som et lille plaster på såret, fordi man tilfældigvis har været en røv, sq vi sige i små 6 mdr. Godt så! Well bout last night, went out with the fabulous 3, even though there is only 2 left... Was supposed to do history with Ási, we hurried through that and had a nice barbecue and drank some wine instead. Paw joined us. Well after the barbe joey came over and we had a few drinks,and therefore decided to go out :) This was of course after joey was properly down on his knees... to put a ring on the finger of course! ;) yesh yesh properly engaged, vegas here we come!  Well town was fun as usual, drinks, dancing, and a wicked game of DIE, right àsi!?! (for those who are lost, one dice two die) :P met some weird ppl @ cosy... bit creepy when u are too sober, must keep in mind- note to self!  Evening ended with joey dragging me home waaaaay too late, and when got of bus, realized that keys to house was in car, which was neatly parked @ ási's... so after a little detour i came home without falling over too much... all in all a successful day...  Nu skal der bare gøres rent, er alene hjemme Dee er ude og hente lunse i lufthavnen... yesh der trænger vist os til det...  Nogen der kommer og hjælper?
