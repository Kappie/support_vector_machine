I went, but valiantly fought against the urge to consumer any chocolate. This morning, my prospective gave me a bar of dark chocolate, containing 71% cocoa. Then, when I entered the Black Building, the public health students were holding a dessert-filled bake sale. Honestly. I'm trying to count calories here! Finally, I gave up. When I got up to PH17, I broke down and had a piece of the chocolate bar. I know I know. I'm WEAK.
