I've forgotten everything I 'learned' in math in middle school which totally sucks. But i'll be okay. Yesterday i went shopping AGAIN for a bookbag...and i got this grey messenger one with flare.hehe. Moms helping out at a yard sale again with my neighbors. So she came into my room while i was sleeping and told me that she was leaving.....i heard her...thats weird, cuz usually i dont hear anything when i sleep. Oh ya and i had the weirdest dream last night. Lemme tell you, its taken place in some of those teen horror films.....i was locked in at school.......alone!!! well i wasnt alone......but anyway i was alone!!! and all the lights in the hallways were out!! and all the doors were locked to classrooms so i couldnt go hide in a little corner. so i just basically wonderd around the entire school..alone.....not alone but alone......ya know? :p it was weird but anyway!!!,,,,,,,im tired and i hate summer, every year something bad happens, or i just dont like it. I want to be with my best buddy franny, i didnt get to visit....but, there will be times where i will get to, so ya. um............deidra called....i think you can figure that out for yourselves. bragging,,,,,yucky. i know shes like excited and all but she doesnt have to rub it in!!! i've always wanted to go to school in ny....i still kinda do. for designing stuff. or just something. omg and guess what!!! i got All American Rejects cd, okay well its not that exciting>im just trying to sound like im excited when i write stuff lol. okay well i'll probably post later, im gonna go watch Ellen Deghenerouselakjdf;laskdjfs; however you spell her name cuz shes funny. and oh ya did anyone watch that blue collar tv?, they had Ron White as special guest...omg he's sooooo frikkin funny...cuz every stand-up i watch of him, he always has a cigarette in one hand and a scotch in the other!!>>>haha
