Chris came home on the Sunday so we spent most of the day together first up the glen lounging round in the sun and when it got to hot!!(amazing yes i said to hot) we went for and ice cream and found a picnic spot under a tree in the shade for a while.  Im back at work today, been doing a little revision for my resit although im still not getting the calculations so we will just see how the exam goes, think i may have to re sit it again next semester.  the re sit exam is next week and im planning on heading down to my mums for a few days after that, im not sure if Chris is coming with me or not, it may be a bit to soon to inflict him with my family, he may meet them and decide to run a mile!!
