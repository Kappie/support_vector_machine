Then I babysat for Rachael and Jason.  Oh good news!  I got a job.  Well, not really, but the first week of August I'm babysitting Rachael and Jason for the week.  So I guess that's a somewhat job.  On Tuesday, my family and I rode the bike trails for about 10 miles and boy is my ass sore today.  But today, oh today was filled with interesting things.    Renae called my cell and for whatever reason I had to call her back.  I did but from my house phone and then she had to hang up so she called me back at my house.  Well my mom turns around and yells at me for tying up the phone lines.  But in the same sentence she yells at me for using my cell phone too much.  Then my dad, tonight, catches me talking on my cell for what he calls, "shooting the shit," and yells at me.  So either I cut back my cell phone usage or it's out.  But then I ask what am I left with?  Can't talk on the cell for too long, can't talk on the house phone too long, and can't go on the internet during the day.  Am I supposed to resort to smoke signals?  I can't help I'm a very social person!  I can solve my parents problem very easily if they'd only see it my way.  Get cable internet and get a plan that has more minutes.  There problem solved!  Wow, you're a smart one Kayla!  Thank you, I do try!  Okay, moving on to tonight.  Well first I ran errands with Renae and then went shopping with Logan this afternoon for Alisha's birthday present.  My family and I went to Bagel boy...cuz it's my new obsession.  Renae picked me up in her new kick ass honda civic at around 7, picked up Megan and then mozied.  Yelled, HI to Mr. Denovan and yeah...Hung out at Alisha's a bit and then went to Thunder Road.  The Go-Karts were fun but I have not intention of doing them in the near future.  Then we rock climbed on this wall.  I will never do that again but I did get to the top twice and can now say I did it.  Renae, Megan, Logan, and I got bored so we went to Wal-Mart and picked up some cheap fireworks.  We were racing time at this point b/c of stupid ass curfew.  It was 10:30 at this point.  Only to have Alisha call and oops, Renae had Alisha's keys, so we raced back to thunder road a good 15 minutes away give or take stoplights and speeding.  Got there, gave 'em the keys and raced back to Alisha's to get our pyro on!  Now, 10:45.  I called my dad, on the same cell phone I am to cut back from and smoothly said we were watching a movie and that it would be over in a half hour so I'd be late coming home.  My dad believed me only when I said Logan would take me home b/c he's 18 and the city doesn't enforce the curfew on him. So we lit a bunch of smoke bombs in the street and lit some sparkelers.  Both of which are illegal in city limits but no one really pays attention so who cares?  Tonight was fun...I hope Logan found his way out of my neighborhood....  Love ya, Kayla
