I got to go in every shop I wanted!!! :D  After much deliberation I purchased a skirt and a sweater for sadie hawkins.  They are soooooo coool! The skirt is like pin-striped. :D Yay!    Then my dad came and picked my sister and I up and we headed to the soccer game. We rode the monerail. (Sp?)  It took like a half an hour to get the PGE Park, where the game was being held. The train was sooooooooooo squished! I ould barely breathe!! When we finnally arived at PGE there was a HUGE line to get in! To we stood in line with all the crazy soccer fanatics....I took a picture. It was so awesome!!! There was the GIANT soccer ball....it was cool. Then there was a goal that you ttry to get a ball in and just random stuff like that. There were a bunch of people handing out free stuff. I got a necklace. There was also a band of drummers which was pretty spiftacular.:D They had face painting too! But we were in too much of a hurry that I couldn't get my face painted....waaa.  We also saw Ronald McDonald. It was prety scary!!!! He walked over to us and was like "Hi! How's is going??"     When we finaly intered the stadium the USA and German teams were warming up. We went to our seats and watched for a while, then I went and got a drink of water. It was so hot in ur seats because the sun had not gone down far enough yet so the sun was right in our eyes!   The game finally started!!! I thought US would win the WHOLE game. They played a  really good game but none of there shots would go in! It was sooo sad!  The game pretty much went the same...missed shots by US, made shots by Germany. It was super depressing!!!!!!! Finally US lost 3-0. Waaaaa! USA looked SOOO sad out there. They were like on bended knee with there head burried in their face. :( I took many pictures.  Then there was a long break. I just sat on our seats the whole time. My dad went to go get hot-dogs. They were kind of gross. :P  When Canada and Sweeden started to warm up on the field my brother, sister, and I went down to the front row seats and I took some pictures. My sister is a weirdo so she started to yell "GO BRITNEY!!!" and they guy who was standing nect to us goes "Who's Britney?" and mysister was like "Uh...I have no clue" *rolls eyes*  The game finally started, yipee!! Canada took over the game at the sart and quickly made a goal. I was super happy since Canada is reallly bad!!! :) But then Sweeden stole the game RIGHT and the very end and ended up winning 2-1. I was so sad!!  All the teams I rooted for lost, I think I am cursed.  Well...its time to go to school! I will write more later  Love, Laura
