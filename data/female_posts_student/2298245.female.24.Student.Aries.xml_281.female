Here's just a short bit:   One sign carrier shouted that Jews who support Israel are worse than Nazis. Another demanded that I be tortured and killed. It wasn't only their words; it was the hatred in their eyes. If a dozen Boston police were not protecting me, I have little doubt I would have been physically attacked. Their eyes were ablaze with fanatical zeal...   See the link above for more, and go  urlLink here  for the whole piece by Dershowitz.  This reminds me of my days at NYU, where it was unusual - though not unheard of - to hear similar things.  I remember one thing in particular, though I don't remember many of the particulars, when, after 9/11, one of the Arab groups on campus associated their organization with a letter from notorious bigot and anti-Semite David Duke.  Here's an  urlLink editorial from the Washington Square News  (NYU's campus newspaper) on the affair, with some more details.  The student who was responsible for disseminating the letter later withdrew it, claiming that she did not know who David Duke was.  I make no observation about the veracity of her claim, so for now we will just say that she was negligent in not investigating anything about the background of the person who wrote the letter before putting it out to the public as representative of her organization.  This is bad enough.  That and the association with the content of the letter itself.  I have noticed though a trend for those on the left, who are generally pro-Palestinian, to let their support of that cause to bleed over into anti-Semitic furor, especially since 9/11.  It seems that the left's tolerance only goes so far.  I was raised as a conservative Christian, and I was raised to respect Jews and to support Israel.  My grandfather has studied and related aspects of Judaism and Jewish culture to me.  I heard much about the grand Judeo-Christian tradition of which I was a part.  Perhaps my upbringing was unusual for someone with similar Christian right tendencies.  But I think it might be more common than some realize, particularly the support for Israel.  And I think that is kind of interesting.
