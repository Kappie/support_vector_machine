So, sorry that i haven't written in a while, but my other blog(s) have been taking up much too much space. I had a revelation yesterday, and i found out, that i view bob and margaret... and tim i guess in a totally different way. now it seems to be like, hey, instead of, hey you guys want to go watch a movie or something, with me, together, like now? grr.. nah, i don't know what i will do. i won't know until i see him again.
