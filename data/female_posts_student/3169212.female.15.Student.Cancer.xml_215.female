Im gonna go crawl in a cave and eat chikenwings for the rest of my life. *leaves*  Inuyasha:  Good  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I second that.  Elizabeth: Hey, be nice.    Inuyasha: NO  Elizabeth: *advances toward inuyasha*  Inuyasha: *grabs for tethsusiga but it is not there and gulps*  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: *anouncer voice*  And in this corner, mates we have the lovely, yet scary Elizabeth.  And in the other corner we have the ruggedly handsome - not as ruggedly handsome as me, savvy? - Inuyasha! And their off.  Elizabeth jumps at Inuyasha.  They stare ate each other for a moment.  Elizabeth kicks and ...owch *Inuyasha falls*  Why did you go do that?  That is a very week spot, love! Its not fair, savvy!  Elizabeth:  Can it, Sparrow or you will get the same!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: *crickets chirp*
