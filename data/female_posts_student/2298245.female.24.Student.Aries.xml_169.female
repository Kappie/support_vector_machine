First of all, there is no one here worth impressing, and any adjustment that you could possibly make to yourself in the mirror is probably not going to affect anyone's impression of you anyway.  Second of all, you clog up the works for people who need to use the restroom for it's actual purpose in a hurry between classes.  Third of all...well, it just annoys the hell out of me.  I mean, I'm here to learn, not to look like a princess or supermodel.  I can see wanting to look put together; after all, it is a professional school.  But these girls often look anything but professional, wearing tight blue jeans and those pointy, spiky dress shoes with them, and way, way too much makeup.  But I digress.  I don't care what you wear.  I don't even care if you primp.  Just do it out of the way.
