I'm back from a 3 day 2 night Adventure Training Camp (NPCC) at Pulau Ubin. it was so incredibly enthralling and memorable.  natalie ,  valerene ,  hafiz ,  jeff ,  chihwei  and I were selected among our other squadmates to assist the sirs and ma'ams at the camp. we were considered as NCOs there. =D those secondary 2 kids were so adorable. they could not quit addressing me as "ma'am". same goes for nat and all. that was the very first time i felt.. "BIG".      Day 1   Left school for the jetty at Changi then took a ferry to PU. hiked a long ass distance to the campsite with all the heavy 'barang barang'. the 6 of us were the first to arrive with a coupla' sirs cos we had to unpack all the food rations, tent-pitching equipment and stuff. we had to do most of the 'dirty work'.  The secondary 2 cadets took quite awhile to settle down. they took almost up to 2 hours to pitch their tents (4 to each) when a team of 8 can actually do it in 15 minutes. afterwhich, own activities.. while the NCOs had to take care of a lot of other stuff. so tiring k. dinner was quite fun.. outdoor cooking. had instant noodles and some can food. i looove pineapples! the weird thing is that, everyone at the camp seems to have a fetish for pineapples.  Activities til' damn late. mock campfire was hilarious. the NCOs helped out a lil' in the cheering part then  sir yongfa  did some silly dances.. =D got to know some cute ACS(I) guys cos' i sat beside them during the mock campfire. haha. NCOs took our bath at 11 plus. i slept at.. hmm.. 1am ++? cos this annoying freak sir SO had to wake val, nat and i up in the girls dorm to switch dorms.. *tsk tsk.   But before that.. we were enjoyin ourselves bathing.. while the sec 2s all had to knock it down duno how many? stay in pumpin position.. under sir kiwi.. so don't expect him to be merciful.. cos truthfully, a bunch of em' were blatently rude and rowdy.  very  disappointing.      Day 2   Woke up to the bellowing of  sir benghui  and that  dragonball dude  at 6am ++ during the sec 2's physical training. so many casualties! heard they kana pumping lotsa times. Jeff cooked noodles for nat and i then we became nurses of the day. heh. gotta take care of those poor lil' souls. some were faking. their acting skills seriously suck big time. *sigh*  All left for  the amazing race  around pulau ubin from 9am-4pm.  sir kiwi  made the NCOs in charge of the casualties and we had to stay indoors. they had to do area cleaning! at first i thought sir kiwi was being really mean to get the sick ppl to wash the toilets and stuff. however, sir kiwi has done all those first aid crapola shitznitzz before and he could tell who were really sick and who weren't. power rite. the cadets i was in charge of were really obedient. on the other hand, val's group of boys were a disaster. they tried to lock her in the campers toilet.. sprayed water at her..point middle finger.. blah blah. val complained to  sir alan . all knock it down. sir alan so zai!!!  This new town boy kept asking nat what my name was  then when i walked down the slope to check on them scrubbin the messtins at the campers toilet, he began following me everywhere i went and wanted me to tell him my telephone number, address and 'if i gotta boyfriend or not?' or else he would not stop followin.. he's quite funny larh.. but must maintain NCO standard sia.. haha.. so me just smile at him talk abit and made sure that he wasn't 'eating snake'. then.. hmm.. cleaned somemore.. slacked big time.. let them rest.. very soon it was 4pm plus and the teams from the amazing race returned all bushed. sec 2s kana pumping  again ... this buncha' campers are so nonchalent. Dinner was provided by Mr Lau. (yay!) he treated the NCOs to friedrice. glad he knew we were sick of the instant noodles. campfire til' 10 plus.. er it was quite alright lar. kinda' boring but erm quite funny? once again, they kana pump. *sigh* NCOs took our baths at 11 plus then nat, val and i decided to sleep in the canteen with some of the sirs and ma'ams. sir kiwi spoke to us.. wow.. raised mah confidence level and i really appreciated what he had told us. me was so effin' cold.. practically freezing! could not sleep cos the benches were er, hard? -.-"     Day 3   Woke up early. had lotsa' things to settle cos it's the final day. PT as usual. shared noodles with jeff then packed our bags.. packed rations into boxes.. we were treated like servants and dogs.. did dirty work told by sirs. those mean mean ones from new town especially. i don't quite like em. even had to take out all the 34 sets of bed sheets and pillow covers all those crapola shitznitzz then fold them and all tt... val say next time no job we shld work at ritz carlton hotel clean hotel rooms. -.-" later.. packed those tent equipment.. etc etc from 7am plus to 10 plus just kept being told to do all the work loh. today  sir OJ  allowed us to PUMP THE CADETS! wow. but none of us did.. took group pix then left the campsite.. hiked back to jetty then back to where i belong hehe.   OKie gonna sleep now... toodles.
