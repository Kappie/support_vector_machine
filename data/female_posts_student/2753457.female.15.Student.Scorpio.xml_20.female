When the announcement was made fourth period about school closing early, the whole of the east gym burst out with sound.  It was really kind of funny.  Unfortunately, I was too lazy to go to my locker, and so my lunch was left in there to rot over the weekend.  Haha, how pleasant.  Then at home, I watched "Pirates of the Caribbean" for some reason.  It was really the only dvd around, and I was in a Depp mood. I almost had a heart attack when I saw that it was 8:30 when I woke up yesterday morning.  I ambled to the computer, and when I saw that there was no school, I ambled right back into bed without a backwards glance.  Slept four more hours, which shouldn't have been done.  I felt like a gross bum for the rest of the day.  At 6:30, my mom and I picked up Becca from her house, and she took us to the Rialto.  This is always quite amusing; I love how well Becca and my mother get along.  But because nothing can ever go right and my life will always be a sitcom, turned out "Girl with a Pearl Earring" wasn't playing there anymore.  Lovely.  And since my mother had already taken off, we decided just to walk back to my house, since it's really not all that far.  We called Joncie to see if we could swing by, but she had to go out.  So, that was interesting.  I should've worn more than just my hoodie, but oh well.  We got to my mom's house and made some tea, and then basically just talked about life.  Tried to better ourselves.  Never a dull moment with my dearest friend Rebecca.  We came up with two more oneliners for any future attempts at a screenplay.  Any movie I might ever be fortunate enough to be involved with would be only oneliners, I think. Today, I actually got up at a decent hour, and I only slept about eight hours. But my mother trapped me into going to brunch with her, and then I was forced to go to Staples and Borders.  The good thing was that I scored some new pens and pencils out of the deal, but as soon as she found the cd she wanted, we were gone.  I was dragged away from the headphones playing the Belle  Sebastian album.  In Staples, she found and purchased these sticky notes in the shape of huge arrows.  She insisted that they were supposed to be little houses, and that these were perfect for a real estate lawyer like herself.  Sometimes I worry about this woman.  Bloody waste of her money, if you ask me.  Back at home, Hanna and I decided that we would have a gettogether at her house tonight.  But unfortunately, a lot of people were out, and not many could come.  It was still good fun, though.  As much as I enjoy the whole gang, it's sometimes nice to have a smaller party.  Six is a good number.  Though I couldn't tell you what that movie we were watching is about.  I was too busy playing with the little toys that do flips in your hand.  Looked like huge pills.  Actually, my first thought was that they looked like tampons.  Very stubby tampons.  Hahahahahaha, oh me. Now, I'm just sitting here. Ooooh, I wonder how much homework I have.  I need to read "The Odyssey"; we'll see how that goes.  The Oscars are tomorrow, and I am bound and determined to watch every minute.  I actually did this for the first time last year.  And I intend to do the same on Leap Day 2004. Did you notice that I didn't curse in this post??  The closest I came was "bloody."  Over our tea and popcorn, Becca and I agreed that we need to stop cursing so much, because it's getting ridiculous, and it makes you sound kind of stupid.  So, I've decided to give up pervasive cursing for lent.  Hahaha, if you can do that. I'm tired.  I'm going to cuddle up and listen to the "Camp" soundtrack. PS:  Hanna, would you like for me to burn you the aforementioned cd?
