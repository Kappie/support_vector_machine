I woke up at 10am and kind of messed around until 12pm or so.   I spent the better part of the afternoon drinking some incredibly strong coffee, talking to  urlLink  GARY O  , and playing that awful game   urlLink  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City   which I thought would be quite dumb and boring but is absolutely not. I'm ashamed to say that it is deliciously fun to hit people with baseball bats and steal cars, but then again, I'm only human.  right at this moment, there is a yellow jacket under a pillow in the middle of the living room floor. I spotted him there while I was watching the news((finding out we're getting more storms!)), and quickly flung the pillow at him before he could fly away. Now I'm here, a little jumpy, because I'm worried he'll crawl out from under the pillow.  lately my mother has been extra crazy. House sitting and not being with mammaw all the time makes her think she can drink all the time. The night before last she completely flipped and yelled at us forever and made all these weird threats. But that's not the important part of this story.  the important part is that I'm sick of her craziness and I want to go to Tyler. But there is a but, a big BUT. My grandmother((mompat)) had a heart attack and is in the hospital. She lives with my dad in Tyler, as I may have mentioned before, and is the reason I hardly ever visit him. But I decided to bite the bullet and make nice with her for the sole reason of getting away from Shreveport. Well crap, since this happened, I will be stuck in Shreveport even longer.   why do I sound so horribly selfish and lacking concern for my poor grandmother, you ask? It's because there has never been a time in the last 5 years that my mompat has not had a heart attack RIGHT before we come visit. I swear to um... Well I swear to something that it's true! I talked to my dad and she's doing fine. They treated it with medication and she'll be out in a few days. cuh-rap.  I've been thinking about life in Tyler for the entire summer. What will I do all day? I have absolutely no friends there. Ok, so I'm not the biggest social butterfly, but 2 months without friends or going out would suck. Where do you meet people my age outside of school? Maybe I'll try the internet thing? But that's pretty dangerous. Maybe I'll sit at Barnes and noble alone for hours and hours until someone approaches me? I guess I could always chill with my cousin, but she's a flitty cheerleader chick, and even though she's nice I doubt I would fit in her circle. hmmm...  today I baked a cake. A coconut cake. Now, in my opinion, I am the greatest baker in the world and should pursue my dream to be the next Julia child, but mom says chefs don't make enough money and she needs to be well taken care of in her old age. How any of this is relevant, I don't know, but then again how is this blog?  you know, I think I use scotch tape when I make a friend instead of glue. I always come across as so charming, so interesting, and then once that person is my buddy and I get comfortable around them, they realize what a crappy specimen of the human species I am, and suddenly don't call as much. Maybe I just don't take initiative. Maybe I want everyone to come to me and I never make any effort to keep friends. Maybe people are just flaky.  song: Gypsy Rose Lee by The Distillers  all of the sudden I am hit with the worst headache. I think I need some more coffee.
