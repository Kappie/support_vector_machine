I couldve fallen asleep. which I almost did. lol after the Exorcist we watched Cujo, which was better...lol and alesha fell asleep :) lol. it was almost over anyways...when we woke up we started to watch salems lot..but my mom picked me up. oh well it seemed cheesy..I dont like the old movies.. :P well.....I am going to leave now. g'bye and g'day.   Goddess Bless.
