I wish I had something to write about but the sad truth is my life is one of the most boring ones I know.(weird phrasing but oh well)  Plus we don't have home phone so I can't call my friends. We rely on my brother Ardis's  my mom's cell (still working on getting my own. Mom is putting on a strong front though. Could take some work. Ugh) so I can't call my friends if mom is out  ardis is too. High point of the day: stuffed crust pizza for dinner. I also went to the gym (my gym is Curves the one for women in case you were so bored you were actually wondering) My mom works there  she's a member too. Anyway going to go now
