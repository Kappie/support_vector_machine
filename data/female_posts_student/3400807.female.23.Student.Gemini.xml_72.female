Lord, it was You who 
Created the heavens. 
Lord, it was Your hand 
That put the stars in their place. 
Lord, it is Your voice 
That commands the morning. 
Even oceans and their waves 
Bow at your feet.  

 Lord, who am I 
Compared to Your glory? 
Lord, who am I 
Compared to Your majesty? 
I am Your beloved, 
Your creation, 
And You love me as I am. 
You have called me chosen, 
For Your kingdom, 
Unashamed to call me Your own. 
I am Your beloved.
