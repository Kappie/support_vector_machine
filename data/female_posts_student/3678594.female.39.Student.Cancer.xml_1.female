I look forward to summer so much during our long, cold Canadian winters, all the while [conveniently] forgetting that I don't really like hot weather. Now that it is here, I find myself lying prone on the couch with no plans to move until autumn rolls around.     One thing I do love about summer is the food. I love going to the grocery store and seeing the big bins full of watermelons, the wonderful displays of berries and cherries, the lovely fresh herbs and leafy lettuces, blushing peaches, and stacks of farm-fresh corn. The lush produce available now makes my weekly trip to the market a pleasure ....... the air conditioning is a welcome treat, too!    There are certain foods that I always associate with summer. I was thinking about this last night and I find it amusing that so many of my fondest memories are tied up with food and cooking. My summer foods are:        Rhubarb - my father's all-time favorite dessert was rhubarb pie. We had a big rhubarb patch in our backyard that was THE local hangout for the neighborhood cats. Whenever anyone approached the patch, cats would explode out of it and run off in all directions. It was enough to give a person a heart attack if you weren't expecting it. LOL     Lemonade and iced tea - I think the reason I am partial to lemonade is because I love the Country Time Lemonade commercials ...... 'summer will be a short 54 days this year' [unless you're in Canada, then it's only 27 days, lol]. I like my lemonade with mint and there is a fantastic recipe for Pineapple Mint Lemonade in The Vegetarian Gourmet: Easy Lowfat Favorites by Bobbie Hinman.     Corn on the cob - I remember having corn with my father one night when I was young. My cob had a hole in it and I told my father I wasn't eating it because there was a worm in it. He insisted there wasn't. The corn had been boiled and if there had been a worm, he was dead in the bottom of the pot [lovely dinner conversation, eh?]. I went to take a bite and out popped a little worm. Needless to say, I did not finish dinner that night! Years later, I repeated this story to my children. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of telling it at dinner while we were having corn. I thought it was really funny. My kids were not amused and neither one of them would eat the corn!     Peaches - my son's favorite fruit. Not a summer goes by that I don't make something with fresh peaches. Peaches are also my cousin's favorite for pie. Pastry-making is not an art I excel at; yet never does a summer pass without someone asking me to bake a pie. What is it with people and pie? Why can't they all like crumbles or cake or anything that doesn't involve pastry?  Black Forest cake - now this is not a food that most people would associate with hot summer days, and you're probably thinking it's a misprint, but it isn't. My birthday falls in the middle of July and when I was growing up, my father would buy me a Black Forest cake every year for my birthday. Now I make my own fat-free, low-sugar, vegan Black Forest cake. I think it's even better than the bakery version, and I look forward to it so much that I don't even mind turning on the oven and heating up the kitchen!    I do have many more foods that I and my children enjoy all summer long, but those five stand out in my mind. I wonder which foods my children will have fond memories of when they grow up?
