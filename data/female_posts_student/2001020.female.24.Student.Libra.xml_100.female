I honestly don't think anyone's complaining anyway.  I have been waiting months and months to just sit down and spill my heart, so why don't I just indulge myself, just this once?  So, ahhhh.  Time to reflect on the mess that was my second year.  Well, I started off being everyone's lust object and indulging in those desires, then I realized I more than lusted for someone who definitely was not more than lusting back.  He ended up making some lame excuse and making a quick getaway, only to find out later that he was fucking a friend of mine at the same time!  No sweat off his back!  Then I went to Puerto Rico with the sister, after almost sex-free months...then I came back, spiraled out of control one weekend, and I'll pay for it forever.  But it helped me realize that it's time to grow up, time to stop thinking that some acts are merely games.  I then met someone who'd been right under my nose all along, only to be faced with the fact that oh, graduation is near, and oh, he's moving to Florida!  Oh, and yeah, one of us still has yet to make a move...with less than 10 days to go!  And that's just my love life we're talking about!  If we wanna go deeper, I dealt with a backstabbing friend who has no respect for me whatsoever (and now it's just a matter of time until I completely burst and tell him the fuck off), I made a friend in a girl out of circumstances that I don't completely like (and who I also don't completely trust, as she *is* always running after the boys I seem to like), I cut off a friendship with someone when I couldn't handle the fact that we were not going to be in a pseudo-relationship anymore (here-but-not-here girlfriends...and then some!), I compromised my values but I enjoyed doing it (for the most part), and I realize that some feelings are better ignored instead of trying to fight them anymore.  I realized that maybe there actually might be someone out there for me, but it's not here, and it's probably not R, and it's probably not someone I know right now...but I love to think about the boys I *do* know and wonder...PZ being one.  I moved in with my best friend, but we are remaining here in this apartment as more of acquaintances than anything.  I realized who I could trust and who I really can't (but isn't that an epiphany that occurs yearly?).  I didn't travel nearly enough, but I will have the Next Great Intern Adventure this summer in DC.  I hooked up with someone from high school that was symbolic of the most unfinished business of my past more than anything.  What's with me saying "than anything" a lot today?  I must still be in a comparative analysis mindset from that damn paper I turned in yesterday.  I bonded with my mom over the most unlikely event, I watched both my mother and sister get engaged, and then my sister get unengaged (is that a word?) and realize that she could do much better than she was letting herself see.  I finally cut off my ties (in general) with a group of girls who were supposed to be my best friends...but really aren't.  I cried too much over nothing (as I always seem to), and I thought too much about everything (another regular me thing).  I've cursed law school up and down and bemoaned my terrible choice of higher education, but I'm going to pull through for the last year, because I have to.  I didn't do as well as I should with keeping in touch with friends, but they know I love them, I know they know.  I was a better "girl's girl" this year, and I pride myself on that...after all, my real friends are HERE, and nowhere else, save maybe NYC (A, K) and my sister and my mom.  So...that is me, that is life, that is my year in review.  I am terrified of my third year in law school, but you just have to roll with the punches, right?  I'll make it.  I always do.  I've made it this far...I'm not gonna lose it.
