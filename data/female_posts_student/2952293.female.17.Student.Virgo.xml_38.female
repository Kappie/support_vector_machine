That night I went to Erica's to hang out. We did some of our favorite things: eat hot dogs and watch the travel channel. Her Spain trip sounded amazing! On Friday we saw old footage of the male teachers performing as BSB.. it was so funny. Then it ended, the screen went up, the music started, the curtains opened, AND THERE THEY WERE! We were screaming like mad. It was the best concert I've ever seen! That night I went to get my nose pierced. I did, I finally did. I'm not waiting anymore... it was awesome. I took my catholic friend, Ann. I also got my ear cartilage pierced, why not just go for it? When we were waiting, we were looking at this wall of really odd pictures. We were kind of laughing at this one, it looked like a woman with something on her stomach. That's when the man informed us she was a Siamese twin gone terribly wrong. It wasn't too funny after that. My mom and Ann told me that when he pierced my nose it was really creepy cause the needle was like hanging out... eww sorry you had to see that. It was fun nonetheless. That night I hung out with Anna, it was really funny. She bought something at Delia's and they said she could get some free candy. She let me pick it out, and I picked those wax bottles that you rip off the top and drink the juice. She'd never had one so we were really excited to try them. Well, we ripped it off and sucked down the juice. I thought it had gone bad, because it was incredibly sour. Her face was so funny. She was trying to pretend like she liked it, but was really grossed out, and I was like "No this isn't right!" Well, they were supposed to be sour, oops! I babysat on Saturday night. The little boy goes, "I didn't know your nose was pierced. It's really gross." Thanks, thanks a lot. Then I went to Cleveland with my mom. It was so nice to get away and spend time with people who actually care about me. I'm seriously anticipating summer. It's time for some big changes.
