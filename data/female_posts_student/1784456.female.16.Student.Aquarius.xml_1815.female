(thats if everyone invited comes!) and i have just done the single most stupid thing in the entire world. i have invited robyn to stay that weekend so she can meet everyone and we can see eachother. i am actually kinda hoping that she says she cant come that weekend because i dont no where she's gonna sleep if she does come down cos we dont even have a spare mattress any more i dont think. may be i can get rid of my bro and sis for a couple of nites. that'd be a bit better.
