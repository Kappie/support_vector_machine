I thought this day would never come, but its only a month and a half away and I'm getting nervous!  Nervous excitement, but nervous nontheless...  I am going to pick up my cap and gown today and find out about getting a yearbook or getting pictures taken with books behind me (making me seem studious or something) and should I get a class ring?  Naaah.  Well, maybe... but I'd rather use the money to get pretty plants put into the front yard, y'know?  Its hitting me and yet it hasnt hit me yet.  I think I'm going to cry at graduation.  For sheer relief that its over.  Of course, then I could get my Master's, but I'm thinking I'd take a break first...for  another  5 years perhaps...hehehe...
