My old bag is twice as heavy as my computer.    These bags are from  urlLink Cased Closed Bags , a company owned by April Lockhart and Debra Wong, who longed to have stylish laptop cases that were affordable. Cased Closed comes in ten styles, from the casual Messenger style  Larry Jr . to the more business-like  Neal Collection . The Bob style is my favorite because they're compact enough to function as sleeves for a larger bag, and you can get cool linings like gingham or  urlLink sushi .   I am now coveting the  urlLink Levenger Laptop PJs . These cute pastel colored leather bags never have to come off since they have a "trap door" that gives you access to all your ports. There's also an adjustable band for added protection, so your computer gets a snug custom fit. Sounds just about perfect and the price isn't too bad either at $119. We may have a winner.
