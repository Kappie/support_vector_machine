I've had fun I guess, but it just hasn't been as fullfiling as hoped for.  Well so far I've gone to the rec center everyday to do laps, gone to the movies twice and I might go again today.  I want to see The Whole Ten Yards.  I love Matthew Perry.  I've gone to the mall (my least favorite place in the world) twice.  I've gone on about 5 bike rides through Crockett Park.  And yesterday to make some cash I weeded my whole front and back yard.  Holy Cow was that a nightmare.  Good thing though, I got sun tanned.  Whoo hoo! Oh yeah and I got my own cell phone.  It's a sony ericsson and it is so cute.  I need your opinions though, I'm ordering a face plate for it and I can't decided between a bubblegum pink one or a hot pink one (not neon but a darker hot pink).   Well that's all for now.  Sorry I Haven't posted in a while.  I just didn't want to, I guess.  P.S. To make your easter even more specialer check out the Rapping Easter Bunny (under links). Enjoy the rest of spring break!
