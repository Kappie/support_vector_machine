(darn computer hoggers in my family) well anyways. let's see what went on this week... hmmm well ok,           I started pilates about 2 weeks ago. it's not too hard. and it does make you feel a lot better once you're done. i would actually reccommend it to anyone that is looking for fast excersise (i think that's spelled wring but oh well) program. what else? hmm well i got 3 new CD's too. that was pretty cool. (Goldfinger-open your eyes, Jet-get born and reel big fish- turn the radio off - i think that's what it's called) All three are pretty good albums, but my fave is goldfinger, they're a mix or ska, rock, punk and a hint of pop, but watch out for the parental warning.          Good thing. about school- I raised my math grade from a D- to a D+. yeah still not great but it turns out my teacher gave me a 0 or a 100 pt test intead of an 82. so it raised my grade 14% that was really cool. yeah still need to raise it more and only have a FEW MORE WEEKS LEFT OF SCHOOL. yeah char don't say anything i know youre done next week. -Andrea-hey you
