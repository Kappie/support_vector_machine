Crash Into Me  Dave Matthews Band   You've got your ball, you've got your chain Tied to me tight, tie me up again  Who's got their claws in you my friend?   Into your heart I'll beat again  Sweet like candy to my soul  Sweet you rock, and sweet you roll   Lost for you, I'm so lost for you    Oh, and you come crash into me   And I come into you  And I come into you In a boy's dream In a boy's dream   Touch your lips just so I know  In your eyes, love, it glows so  I'm bare-boned and crazy... for you    Oh, and you come crash into me   Baby, and I come into you  In a boy's dream In a boy's dream   And if I've gone overboard then I'm begging you   To forgive me in my haste   When I'm holding you so girl, close to me   Oh and you come crash into me, yeah Baby, and I come into you Hike up your skirt a little more And show the world to me Hike up your skirt a little more And show your world to me In a boy's dream In a boy's dream  Oh, I watch you there through the window and I stare at you  You wear nothing, but you wear it so well   Tied up and twisted, the way I'd like to be   For you, for me  Come crash into me Come crash into me, yeah Crash into me...Crash into me...  You know,  I'm the king of the castle,You're the dirty rascal  Crash into me  Please crash into me, baby...  Oh, no no no... Yes, I see the waves Come and crash into me  See the waves come and crash into me  Crash into me
