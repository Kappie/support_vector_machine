My sister got hold of the sacred scroll adn read some of the stuff, lets just say she may never talk to any of us ever again! Was at work yesterday so am completely knackered *its sooo hard doing practically nothing all day*, and then i was playing board games again last nite becasue i had no one to go out with adn no where to go! I live such an exciting life.  In fact its soo exciting i get to spend today tidying my room and then i have to go down the RC to watch my mum play my bro at his own game!  *btw, the answer to my current screen name is not perspex man and i am not going to tell you the answer no matter what u do. u'll have to kill, and then you wont get the answer anyway cos i'll be dead* xxxx
