Today, I am about to break that long held traditon, I'm going to spill it out, everything...  I am fresh out of my first examination in college. I don't know why but the whole idea of being in college is all..well...bed and roses...birds and the bees. Only four months and we had to sit for the term test. So I guess reality ain't in synchrony with our presumptions.  The exams only lasted a week and I can tell you, it was a LONG week. I was basically prepared, I believe even the librarian(who actually memorised my student identification number) can attest to this fact. (I had made the library my second home).Nevertheless, life is filled with many suprises and pot holes full of shit that will claim your perfumed feet once in a while.  The First Day:  The schedule included two papers, both of which required the left side of the brain to work with. Pure Mathematics and one of its progeny, Mechanics. I remember sitting down getting myself comfortable and slowly assimilatiing myself with the atmoshpere of the dark Auditorium. I said my prayers, cluthing my holy chain thightly, hoping with the damnest that I will remember solving methods and use the right one to unravel the questions. When the invigilators said "Begin", I took a deep breath, and the battle of Students against all that Evil represents begun...........  The Second Day :  It was to be the most horrible day of all, if only I took my feelings as a forewarning seriously. The schedule was like....SHIT. Forgive my outburst, but I am not lying. I had Physics, followed by Chemistry. And the gap between the two? 15 minutes. I was in a quagmire, of faeces, germs and everything else. I can safely say the worst paper I had was none other than Physics. How do i explain this and claim your sympathy? Relatively easy! The paper was to be done over with by one hour. And the questions, it required two hours. Please refer to Sighting : Episode 2 : Teachers from Hell.  Whatever would be, would be, right Sarah? I walked down the stairs, literally stoned. I vented my anger on two unfortunate souls, and got ready for my Chemistry.  Chemistry, oh dearest, my illicit affair with this branch of science(only a privilaged few knows...). The paper, it was a JOKE! I am not saying it was easy-peasy. I'm saying it was a plain joke. Never in my short life have I sat for such a paper. The question began with a characther, Ah Long, who had a compony, called 'Chem R' Us'. The whole paper gave us an account of his life. It was enjoyable, and you know that you are suppose to laugh, but how do you do it in an examination hall? Not only did the lecturer put us in conflict with our human emotions, he made it a struggle for us as there was no way we could skip a question and 'go-astern', we had to attempt the question as they appeared, simply because it was a story, without using any creative afforts like flaskback. If your curiosity tickles you, the paper ended with the marriage of Ah Long and his long-time girlfriend and they produced some Ah Boon and Ah someother...  I have decided to keep the third and the fourth day for tomorrows' edition..  p.s - it is just too painful...
