I went to Fredericton with my dad on the 1st to bring some stuff to the apartment. The apartment is great. I love it! It is nice and big. I can`t wait to be there. I have choosen all of my courses for September. There is one course that i don`t not want to take but i needed another 3 credits to finish the year. Who knows maybe i will like it. Anyways i have to get going. Have a good week!
