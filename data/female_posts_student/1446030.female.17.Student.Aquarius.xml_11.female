Life seems to b so colourless.  EVERYTHING  seems to be so meaningless wif little colours (mayb onli black and white...but then, black and white ISNT colours neway...duhz) Am i being too pessimistic? YOU may be thinking:" aiyahz, u think too much liaoz", but i think otherwise. nvm...got not much to talk abt either...craps...  I   G ot  N othing  T o  S ay. i reali need sumone to b by my side to support me when i'm feeling 'tired'. but none is capable of doing that yet...so i can onli struggle along until i can find sumone that can gif me e strength to carry on...now i can onli survive on my determination... every dae pass has taken away an ounce of my energy, sum dae i noe, sum dae... i will collapse... so, i can onli pray that b4 that happens, i'd alreadi found that special one who will support me. *sad*sad* so lost, any directions for me? so hopeless, who can give me hope? so hurt, who can heal my wounds? only the same person that has inflicted them.
