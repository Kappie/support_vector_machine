My dad got me another celica. same as my other as far as I know. I think I have to get a job though. :( Not that it bothers me too bad...considering I'm not ever doing anything anyways. Ok let's see...we have 13 days left of school I think. GOOD THING! I miss Matt. Yes, Matt Harding. You know? It's weird. Everyone was telling me "hey you need to date other people, you dont need anything serious while in high school"...well i don't care. I miss him so much, we were together too long for me just forget him..I can't and I won't. Couples have their ups and downs...and their break ups and stuff...PLEASE let this be a bump in the road! I'm not going to try to talk to him and get him back, I've done that before. I'll let him go. I know that's what he wants...I think he likes the whole dating thing better anyways. I love him with all of my heart still though. If there was...ANYTHING in the world I could do to get him back, I'd do it. I'd die for Matt. I don't want to be with anyone except him. I'll love him more than anyone, always. and if he wanted me back, I'd go with him quicker than anything. I don't care that he's going to Alabama, I'd stay with him, hoping to see him any time that I could. I want to be his so bad. omg and that song BURN-USHER..yeah I cry everytime I hear that song. I'll pray everyday that something happens and I get to be with him. I'd be the luckiest girl in the world. He means more than life to me. I know I love him, if he loves me back and it's TRUE love, I know I'll end up with him one day...no matter how long. But if I don't end up with him, i know it's not what's meant to be.  Ok, I just felt like writing about Matt. I love him with all of my heart.  -alicia
