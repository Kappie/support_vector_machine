Especially when one of them jumps off or lands in the water before the other one/s... LOL, I'm evil.      OMG I should really start my Society assignment.. Okay, start  tomorrow . Geez, I'm hopeless.      LOL how funny are those Police Academy movies?! I love Zed..      Mahoney: "Come on, let's talk."    Zed: "I'm not in the mood! *stops* Okay, I'm in the mood! So..where are ya from??!"  XoD      I found this site bursting with Paul McCartney pics and I was like  this close  to wetting myself. He was so  hot  spankworthy 30-40 years ago... *sigh*       I'm eating the new Cadbury Dairy Milk Malt Crisp block... =o9 I was eating a pack of chocolate pretzels before..I love them because they remind me of my childhood.. ='o( *seriously needs a glass of water*      I deleted 60MB of crap from my computer! *beams with pride* And I deleted lots of stupid pics from my phone too.. But I accidentally deleted a folder full of pics of my buds..Which is a major drag... *goes off to munch on chocolate pretzels*
