Now I believe that at time it can be bad but I'm doing all I can to fix that. Heck I even gargle with hydrogen peroxide! So really my breath is just lovely.   The stupid springs are making my face hurt. From my nose to my chin is in pain.   Boy whoever reads this must think I'm a horrid looking smelly person! I'm really not, I just tend to dwell on the least desirable of my features. I've been told I have lovely hair, good eyes and great lips.   Finished that Anne Rice novel of mine. Ended pretty much the way I thought it would, but I still enjoyed it. Now I can start on the other one. YAY!  I've determined that I have an exam every day next week. That's really not very nice.   Oh Oh, I just remembered! I was utterly shocked by the stupidity of one of the graduating grade twelves in our school today. She asked me for a word that rhymed with foot, so I said soot, and she asked me what soot meant! What does soot mean? Now really you've got to be kidding me! She's in grade twelve she must have taken a provincial, she's got to be at least passing... HOW CAN SHE NOT KNOW WHAT SOOT MEANS! Of coarse I explained it to her and then... MY GOD... she wrote it down and spelt it sout... Where did she learn how to spell? I mean obviously she can spell foot, and soot rhymes with foot, so I don't know why she couldn't spell the bloody word. Well I told her it had double L's so she spelt it again, SOOUT! SOOUT! I nearly cried. So I just took the pencil and did it for her. Now I'm not picking on some mentally handicapped kid or anything. I know this girl pretty well, and she's pretty darned intelligent. She can sew like nobody's business and is very articulate. But I just can't get my head around her not knowing the meaning of, or how to spell, soot.   WHAT IS OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM COMING TO?
