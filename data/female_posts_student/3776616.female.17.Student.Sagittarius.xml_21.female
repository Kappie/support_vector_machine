I start house sitting on Sunday, so if someone wants to claim Sunday night just call me.  We can eat popcorn, watch movies, play w/ the fat cat, build a fire, whatever...  She's got a little pool too, so we can go swimming...  It shall be fun :)  I have 5 or 6 nights, and people can come ovr during the day too, so...  I'll talk to everybody at the car wash on Sat. if I don't call you sometime this week.    I'm so freaking hungry, but I can't eat anything w/o wanting to scream.  I want Taco Bell soooooooooooo fucking bad...  There's no way in hell I could swallow that that.  I hope I feel better by Thurs, I don't want to miss my pics and Robert's b-day thing and all that fun stuff.  I get to see Ken tonight after he gets off work... I'm not sure how it's going to go, b/c we haven't talked since saturday.  He read my blog and posted a comment, plus we've texted back and forth a little. I suppose I probably would have answered last time he called if I could actually talk.  I don't know how well tonight is going to go, but...  *crosses fingers*  I hope we can work everything out.    But yeah, I'm gonna go take some more ibuprofen and see if I can find some soft food to force down my throat.
