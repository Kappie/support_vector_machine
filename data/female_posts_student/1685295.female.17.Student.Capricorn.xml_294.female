Ah, well, so is life, and life's alright so far.  Besides that, I guess there's gonna be some news. Crapasscartoons is gonna haveta wait a while; I think I'll go ahead and declare Hyperspaz Tic the winner in the great "Snake II" war, unless there are any objections; Allan got high; stuff doesn't suck anymore.     Nirvana - Love Buzz  (Verse and chorus, x2) Would you believe me, when I tell you,  you are the queen of my heart? Please don't decieve me, when I hurt you,  just ain't the way it seems.  Chorus: Can you feel my love buzz? (x3) Can you feel my love....buuuuuuzz!?  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....yeaaah...  Originally by Shocking Blue. Written by Robbie Van Leeuwen.    I'm Deadinside, I might haveta change my alias.  "Now if you will be my lover, I wish you were insane. But if you can't be my master, I will do you anything"
