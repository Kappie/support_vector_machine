I haven't read the entire thing, but I'm going to share with you what caught my eye.   Here's the roundup:  One of his readers pointed out that the HBO show,  urlLink Six Feet Under  has included several anti-Bush lines. This I find completely amusing. I watch that show, it's one of my favorites, but I don't recall hearing any anti-Bush one liners. Perhaps, I just don't pay close enough attention. The TV is on, but I don't just sit in front of it. I'm always doing something else. Oh well. I guess it's my own fault then, for missing such amusing antidotes.  Next -  If you're interested, here are the  urlLink bloggers  for the Democratic National Convention. I'll warn you now, that I have not checked out who exactly these bloggers are, so it's very possible they are all evil Republican bloggers.  I kid the Republican bloggers. I love the Republican bloggers.  And last but not least -  An interesting article over at Slate regarding  urlLink Kerry and Langston Hughes .  There you have it. I'm done. Stick a fork in me.
