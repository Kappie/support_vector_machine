       
      Here follows the epic tale of my trip to the Outer Banks. It's really, really, really long. I will not force you to read it - only if you have nothing better to do.  GLOSSARY SU: Sibling Un SD: Sibling Deux BSU: Bitchy Sibling Un SBSU: Still Bitchy Sibling Un Inevitable: Sunburn v.: very   SATURDAY, JUNE 5, 2004  1:41 PM. Driving through Van Wert. Many colorful chairs sitting out on neighborhoods that look suspiciously like downtown Fort Wayne. With about fifty more liquor stores. Apparently there's about to be some sort of parade to-do. This town is even less exciting than ours. And oh, look! Cornfield!  This morning SU went to Indy and had a gym routine choreographed for her. Wasn't All That Jazz *sigh* Too bad; I might've come to see that. She won't hush about it. Luckily she's sleeping.  During this presumably nine hour car ride I have music, books, and writing to keep me completely occupied. I suppose I ought to lay out the itinerary for you. We're driving to Hagerstown, PA, to get to a nice little Holiday Inn. My aunt, uncle, and cousin from Indy will possibly meet us there. We'll stay the night. Then, we'll go down to MD and see Mount Vernon, THEN get to the Outer Banks. After that, I have no idea other than The Inevitable (i.e. Laura Gets a Very Bad Sunburn).  3:40 PM. Blah, blah, blah. SCENE: Me in backseat in tanktop and still wet hair, surrounded by STUFF. Most of it's not mine, which is surprising. Sibs in front of me, speaking in loud, shrill, squeaky tones. SD is playing with the map book (dropping it) and complaining about past injuries.  According to five well-placed signs, we just missed Brice Road. Last time I checked we were in Columbus, Ohio. I looked up all the locations mentioned in RENT and apparently they're all there.  Dad sitting placidly in driver's seat with sunglasses and sandals. He has his Hootie and the Blowfish CD in and it's on repeat. This is the second time through. I suppose if I said something he would change it, but nobody likes my CDs anyway.  Now they're eating carrots. I'm having one. *munches* Good God, I feel like a hamster.  He turned the radio on, yay! We have such good communication.  I don't even know what Mom's doing. I'm sitting two seats directly behind her. SO glad I have the back to myself. I'm sick of those two already. They keep telling me I have to sleep on the cot. I don't WANT to sleep on the damn cot. I want a bed.  SU has hung the bag of carrots from the clothing hook by the window. I pity the poor travelers who drive past and see small, orange objects hanging from the window.  Scenery very dull. I'm going away to do something else.  5:30 PM. Saw funky bridge and went under small Wheeling Tunnel.  SU: Whoa, look at those mountains!  MOM: Just reinforces how ugly our state is.  SU: Too bad glaciers came and scraped us flat. (Proceeds to explain this to SD, who doesn't care.)  7:26 PM. Stopped at Bob Evans a bit ago. Pennsylvania seems to be a very clean state. I like this.  I have a fear. It seems that every time I go out of town something terrible happens. I pray for Hillary.  SUNDAY, JUNE 6, 2004  9:15 AM. No Inevitable yet. Will be.  I had a thought during breakfast... [insert future blog entry here which I will post when I have nothing else to talk about.] Well, I'm done for today. Except that I'm ... [insert blog entry I've already posted when I had nothing else to talk about.] Back to my trip.  We apparently went through WV twice without my knowledge. And Hagerstown is actually in MD. Go figure. In about two hours we'll be at Mount Vernon. Anyway, we got in the Holiday Inn - tried to reach aunt's family but couldn't. Clerk told us they were there.  Went to our room - 132 - and dropped. It was 11 PM their time, 10 ours, so we got ready for bed. I had to share with SU. It was horrible. She wouldn't switch sides with me until my dad forced her. She lay right on the middle edge of her pillow and told ME to scoot over. I was half off the bed anyway, so I kept pushing HER. It just sucked. Dad told me I said "Ouch" twice in my sleep. Somehow I don't think I was sleeping. Didn't sleep at all. Woke up at 6:10 our time, 7:10 theirs. Probably b/c of SU. Annoying child.  Did I mention we listened to Wicked in the car? I started with Defying Gravity (just to secure my position) and got a mini-applause out of them at end. Did not dare request RENT. Want to keep head attached to neck.  Got dressed, blah blah blah cakes. Went down for breakfast (continental!), had coffee to perk me up... finally met Aunt Rose, Uncle Dan, and Sam coming in to eat.  I began to slowly get the impression that all the people in the room were spies. They kept LOOKING. They sat and stared at everyone. One guy's ring seemed to be oddly tilted - camera, obviously. There were random sunglasses sitting on a table - another camera. Eventually I think Ring Spy intimidated all the others away. Him and his bodyguards, yeah. Freaks.  So now, here I am in my aunt's car. Sam switched me. They're watching Looney Tunes: Back in Action on their portable DVD player. I'm sure missing LOADS. I'm just on RENT and writing. I can't remember ever going to DC. Whoo. Just hope nothing blows up. :-P Gah. Bye for now.  12:44 PM. Headed out to find fast food for almuerza. (Just assume I'm listening to RENT on headphones during half the entries.)  Well, Mount Vernon is very nice - 8000 acres of unadulterated HISTORY. Yes, it is cool.  My father commented that SU would be sleeping in the stable and me in the slave quarters. SD was not mentioned. This does not bode well for her. There were servants' quarters/hall - very modest, fake food sitting out.  From there, we passed into the mansion (couldn't take pics), in which we were told Washington decorated everything. Picked the paintings, patterns, furniture, everything. We saw the bedroom where the Marquis de Lafayette stayed once. (If anyone whose brain isn't painfully short-term-oriented remembers more than his name, tell me.) Many nice bedrooms. Saw his AWESOME study - he had a swivel chair! :) And a really big globe. He actually sat at that desk and did stuff. *everyone says "Whoa...."*  But there was one dining room in particular where the wallpaper was comparable to a BP station. Pea. Green. Just that bad. Gah.  Took a few nice pictures outside, went down, saw old tomb, wharf, and new tomb. It feels very awkward taking a picture of George Washington's coffin/grave thing. Very guilty.  Went to a nice little history tent, played games, etc. I read about writing materials and tried to decide if Anamaria was literate or not. Yes, I do spend time thinking about these things. Found out quill pens  slow-dry ink. Quick stop at gift shop and now we are back on the road, still looking for food. Rent on Finale A... :)  2:28 PM. I hope I never get old and buy license plates that say LOVE GFT.  2:29 PM. And I connived my dad into putting in Wicked again. Luckily he didn't remember what number 7 is. Hee. We're on Defying Gravity right now - finale!  2:33 PM. Hah. I am evil. *is taking advantage of mother sleeping and asking dad to flip all over CD*  2:47 PM. Should I be surprised that SU knows half the words to 7  11?  2:50 PM. I would rather see Taye Diggs than our current Fiyero. Taye can sing better. I have proof! *taps RENT CD lovingly*  3:17 PM. I'm starting to fear my CD will burn out from overuse.  3:32 PM. Just passed exits to Yorktown, Williamsburg, and Jamestown. Another day. *has snuck RENT reference in* I'll be doing that a lot.  4:01 PM. *listens to POTC recording* I'm in an underwater tunnel, isn't it thrilling. Walls brick, long side lights, ah, we see light. Under the seeeeeea....  4:14 PM. Passed shop Michael would probably like... Ye Old Mystique - Shop for Spiritual and Religious Supplies. Voodoo, baby, voodoo!  4:52 PM. SD insists that we are in Kitty Hawk. We aren't. We're just PASSING all these cities today, aren't we?  I'm about 2/3 through the Anamaria fic, which is tentatively titled "Borrowed Without Permission." Sibs getting to obnoxious stage. Part where they read all signs out loud, mock me, and make rude noises. At least they aren't touching me.  5:04 PM. Why does this old Jewel song only come on when I'm single?  5:25 PM. I'm going to post the link to my Anamaria story here, when it's there. BRIDGE! YAY! This is how you get to the island. Wright Memorial Bridge.  Just think... once there might've been pirates on this ocean. Maybe touched the same water. *is lost in fantasy* SD singing laxative commercial *dies* I'm yawning a lot. Coffee/coke wearing off.  All these houses are on stilts - v. funny. RENT! There's a RENT SIGN!! Anyway. It's for floods  the like. Wow. This IS v. funky.  5:47 PM. So. Dilly. We're supposed to be able to see both sides of this island - the sound and the ocean. Sound = water between NC and Outer Banks. Ocean = duh.  Ooh, pool ... in glass.  Pulling into driveway of house. SD won't shut up about bodily functions. Bye!  LATER. No clue what time it is. Have locked self in room - will explain.  This house is v. bizarre but cool. We pulled up to the garage and went in - there were several noodles and a boogey board. Walked in. Small room w/ two couches, games, and TV... on other side was stairs - we all go up. Come to this big maze-y mass of bedrooms.  1) Two sets of bunk beds  2) One room with twin beds (mine! hah!)  3) Two rooms with master beds and all  Fun stuff. Closets and bathrooms and all. We go up yet another flight of steps and come to biiiiiig place. Kitchen, living room, porchy thing, loft, table, ee!! Some movies on VHS (but I have Pirates, MWAHAHA), many tables/chairs/stuff.  Currently am locked in MY room b/c SU wants to SHARE. Me. No. Share. Me PRIVATE and I refuse to share another room with her. My old house was torture enough. Grrr.  The original reason was that SU was going to invite Sam in to jump on these incredibly bouncy plaid beds. Again. No.  Did I mention that there are decks EVERYWHERE? One has a deck and a porch swing. And there's a jacuzzi/exercise machine indoors. Finding many mysterious locked doors. Cannot figure out. Mother keeps saying she's lost. She's lost every trip we go on. I'd hate to see her go camping seeing as I am the Queen of Getting Lost in Nature b/c It All Looks Vaguely the Same.  Sibs/cousin going on spider egg hunt. Happy Easter. At least they're killing them all. Other than that, my sister, my clock, and getting lost, there is only one real problem. THERE IS NO PENCIL SHARPENER. I've already written about as much as my journal for Indiana State Museum, don't know what the hell I'll do when the other six pencils die out. Maybe I'll switch to pen. I hate pen.  10:11 PM. (Their time) She's in my room. Oh, WELL. At least I'm not still going all Elizabeth Turner and having that dim lightbulb anymore. Although that would've been fun.  SU is griping that she doesn't have a pillow. Will go upstairs to find privacy until my shower turn.  Right. I am now on what is technically the fourth floor - a mini loft with four chairs and a table. Could be useful for cards if I had them.  Think my dad is getting tired of hearing someone yell "DAD!!" every five seconds. [Will Turner] Here they come. [/Will Turner] Stupid blighters. Right, well, fourth floor is MINE since I don't have my own room anymore.  Because second person POV is nice, and because writing about the ocean is somewhat of a requirement when you're keeping a vacation journal, I give you the following.  You walk along the rocky path, passing beach houses and the smell of grilling hamburgers. Before you is a set of wooden steps. From here, it looks like stepping off the edge means falling into the sky. You come closer, and you see the thin line of the ocean appearing and growing bigger and bigger, thicker. You reach the top of the steps and finally see the sand. It spreads across you like batter and it's sprinkled all over the steps. You reach the sand, and you and your sandals squish through it, until you take them off and go on alone. Your feet hit wet sand, and you clap across it, little holes of air appearing in the ground. The ocean flourishes before your eyes, blooming in waves of white foamy petals. They come roaring at you and you stand, waiting for them to reach you. Several times they brush your toes, but don't go beyond. Finally, you catch sight of a wave - a huge white foamy mass, pushing its way toward you. You let the cool water lap at your ankles and splash your knees. The delighted voice of your cousin yells "I got my shorts wet!" repeatedly. You? You're just glad to be here, looking out on the edge of the world.  I hope God doesn't mind terribly that I missed church. All there is here is a Methodist church. I suppose I'll pray myself to sleep. *Jack Sparrow salute to dad* Fourth floor is so relaxing.  I'm going to ask for a pair of scissors to try and whittle this off... then I'll probably end up writing and going to bed or watching a movie. Gooooooodnight.  MONDAY, JUNE 7, 2004  9:09 AM. I should point out I'm really not getting decent sleep - however rested I may feel. I have huge eye circles. Oh, and I sharpened my pencil with a kitchen knife. Going to change to bathing suit. We're going somewhere.  12:27 PM. I don't think Hillary will like my versions of Anamaria and Amelia. I wrote them into the world, not into us. I stayed true to the movie characters (or I hope I did). *sigh* So close!  I had Corn Chex for breakfast at about nine, and we all trooped out to the public indoor pool. It's pretty nice. It goes up to about five feet, so it's about four inches below my hair. Played volleyball, played gang up on your dad and uncle w/SU's assistance and try to hit them with beach balls (they started it), looked for diving sticks, etc, etc.  We all dried off, were forced to put on sunscreen, and started walking down to the beach. It was kinda cloudy and cold, and I brought my pirate story along because I didn't want to swim. Plus I figured it would be inspirational. Breeze, waves in the background, cinammon fields of sand under my toes.... Lunch!  4:46 PM. If nothing else, I'm getting Inevitable on my face. "I'm staying the week with my favorite uncle." There. I wrote it. He should be happy if he checks.  Oho, I forgot to talk about the necessary!!  If you ever come to the Outer Banks and pass Dianne Street, we are the house completely enclosed in trees. And we are grey.  Our current statues is Possibly Going on a Bike Ride, Then Dinner and Beach for an Hour.  Damn. I'm now stuck watching SD and Sam while everyone else goes on a bike ride.  SAM: (whisper to SD) Let's go and jump on the beds.  ME: Nope. Sorry.  SAM: Aww.  They're playing Life now. After I'm done with all this I'll put on Mask of Zorro again.  I feel very Anne Frank-ish, hanging out in a strange house with 8 people total, writing in a diary. Reading her diary makes me so comforted knowing I'm not alone. And I'm not psycho.  Well, after lunch, we went to a lighthouse - 200 something steps. I thought it was a little tiring, but SU wouldn't shut up about how easy it was. It's when I'm up that high that I remember why I'm afraid of heights. Took nice pics and stuff. before we went up, though, my aunt Rose decided she didn't want to b/c her leg hurt. She's my mom's sister, by the way. There was a worker sitting outside who asked us if we had a big group.   DAD: Seven. She (indicates aunt) isn't going, she has a bad leg.  ROSE: *tsk* Shut up...  DAD: Have you heard that excuse before?  GUIDE: Oh, it's one of the most common. Vertigo, sinus...  Anyway, after that we went (my family only) to this nearby bookstore. It was like paradise, really. It seems like forever since I went in one. I found this BOOK that my parents counted as a b-day present - "The Young Writer's Guide to Getting Published." EE!! Anybody is welcome to borrow it when I'm done.  The lighthouse was built 129 years ago (1875) - and they had another little building nearby that we also saw at Mount Vernon. This little gem is called the "necessary."  Which is my new word for bathroom. *smiles*  Good grief - feels weird. Must be result of the Inevitable. I'll have to change the name when I get it. Maybe the Hadit.  I need to stretch soon.  GAH! My cousin asked me to put in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because he can't reach the VCR. It won't WORK.  SAM: Let's watch the Stress Channel! Where one ordinary teenage girl gets frustrated by one VCR.  Later he amended it to the Frustrated Channel because I gave up.  We had Cosmos Pizza last night. Just sayin. Oh, I just skipped two pages in here. I wondered... And I forgot a sweatshirt and oversized T-shirt and received many sighs and exasperated looks. Hell, if Mrs. Talarico hadn't called and wanted me to babysit, I wouldn't have packed at all. Sleep is bliss. And my hand is starting to throb from where the pencil rests. OW.  6:26 PM. SAM: How can you just sit quiet in a corner and do stuff?  LAURA: I'm just cool like that.  SAM: Just weird...  Sam is 9 years old. He has buzzed blond hair and glasses. And he is incredibly hyper. He could have his own radio show commercial-free, that's how much he talks. But I doubt he could keep still long enough for that. The ironic thing is that as a toddler he did not speak. At all. He used sign language. He is a Pokemon/Digimon/trading card/video game/Yu-Gi-Oh! CHILD. I don't know how he and SD get along so well. She hates that stuff.  11:02 PM. Cannot figure out SU. One minute she is hyper and beeyatchy and the next she admits she's singing Defying Gravity. The only reasonable explanation is, as Kelsey so aptly puts it - HORMONES.  Or it could be that she does stupid, annoying things to get my attention. Still, for all my psych tricks I can't get to her. She won't shut up, she want -  HELP! THE LIGHTS ARE BEING TURNED OUT AND I CANT SEEE...  We played Boggle this evening after getting back from the beach. (I made a sand castle with the initals HG on top. Take a guess what that stands for. I took a picture.)  I think I have decent handwriting in the dark - but we turned on the small Elizabeth lamp so it doesn't matter. I kicked ass at Boggle until my mom showed up and started playing. And who the hell writes "invoke" on their paper? Only mom. See??? That's what I'm up against.  LAURA: Jeeenna?  SU: What?  LAURA: Do you have a boyfriend?  SU: No.  LAURA: Do you want a boyfriend?  SU: No.  LAURA: Why not?  SU: Because they're stupid.  LAURA: (pause) You might have a point. (pause) I'll think about that.  No offense to y'all or anything. You're not all stupid. I think I'm tired, but I'm running on adrenaline.  We briefly discussed trading Sam to the neighbors with the roof porch in exchange for several hand towels and soap (all of which we finally have), but it was dropped. I come from such a cruel family. No wonder I turned out like me.  SU wondered if our house would smell new again when we got back, and without meaning to I brought up what H and I discussed on our sleepover. Did not mention pillows. Mom thought it was funny.  Thank God I wrote her that note. I don't know how things would've worked out otherwise...  Note to self: Ask Brandon for POTC CD to burn... Well, it's about 11:30 their time... I'll read a bit, then GOODNIGHT!!  TUESDAY, JUNE 8, 2004  11:57 AM. SU acting like superior bitch. V. difficult to tolerate. Am in room trying to escape madness.  I woke up at 8:30 and walked in on conclusion of family meeting. Fake celebration commenced. Everyone except for my dad and I went to the pool and Dad said we could go on a bike ride. Got out blue-green bike with v. high seat, purple ill-fitting helmet and went out. There's a nice big blacktop path along the roads - we went about a mile or so, at one point had to cross road and came to townish bit. Nice little bookstore - Dad asked if I wanted to go in. Um, YES!  So we go in and I get a latte - dropped quarters and irritating men stared at me. Couldn't even find said quarters until Dad came and realized they had fallen onto a shelf instead of the floor.  Country music was playing. Dad read a book while I looked around and sipped coffee (very strong!). Not nearly as much new stuff as other bookstore. Thought about getting Diary of Anne Frank but Dad said it'd be hard to get home on a bike. Someday I'll buy that book. Having her birthday used to terrify me. It's just kinda weird.  There was a computer with high-speed internet you could use if you paid $4. Since it was 8 our time I figured no one would be awake to talk to anyway, and even then I wouldn't want to leave - like I do now. BUT.  Some news you do hear from the outer world - I heard about Reagan's death the first day. I happened to pick up part of the Style section of the newspaper and flip through. IDINA MENZEL WON THE TONY!! WHEE!!  11:51 PM. Will write about rest of day tomorrow - way too tired. Night.  WEDNESDAY, JUNE 9, 2004  10:00 AM. Or so I think. It's hard to tell time on the beach if it isn't noon. I'll start with yesterday. After our lunch, we drove out to Roanoake Island, home of the Lost Colony. You might remember this from our history class *takes on droll Mr. C style* A group of settlers from England set up a Virginia colony, the first of America. Technically it's the first, and Jamestown is the first permanent settlement. Virginia Dare was born there, the first American child. Only one problem: they all vanished. And still nobody knows what the ____ happened to them. Anyway *tone stop* that's why it's so famous.  The first place we stopped at was an aquarium. Note: I have visited Shedd Aquarium in Chicago and once you've been there, every other aquarium kinda pales in comparison. It was a very nice little place - I was fortunate enough to touch the bouncy, slimy soft back of a sting ray. It was actually rather terrifying trying to put your hand in the tank and watch the aggressive ones flapping their wings on the glass with little thunks. In honor of Hillary, I found several purple fish! And there were many others. Let's see... after that we headed to this thing called History Festival. Only it wasn't a festival, it was just history.  We were greeted at the entrance by a man in period clothing of 1585 (or whereabouts) - green leggings and a Robin Hood type hat. He was rather funny. Told us to tarry not, but to beware the swamp beset with biting flies. And I just kept thinking, Michael... I have found you a career. Someday - those green leggings... *goes off and snickers*  But it was nice. And we found our way outside to a small ship, the Elizabeth II. I practically scoured the place, looking at everything, in my POTC obsessive way. It was too big to be Anamaria's and too small to be the Black Pearl. Kind of a mini-Interceptor. I saw the post that swung around and Will hanging for dear life (I really need to learn the names of these things); saw captain's quarters and ship's quarters and everything. Mast and crow's nest and rigging. There was a cute guy with an adorable fake Irish accent (hard to tell it was, but it had to be) and an older guy who showed Sam, SU, and me how to tie three knots. Square, sheath, and double-sheath (spelling probably off). We got to keep the rope (mine is purple!). [Since then I have been unable to find it :(]  We realized that they were showing a movie, so we rushed over to watch it. It was about the Indians' reaction to the English settlers coming. Not a documentary - more of a drama. It was pretty well done, I was surprised. Except the little girl couldn't act, but she just had to ask questions so I don't blame her.  After that we went down to the settlement. Two guys were there as well - cute blond guy with Irish accent (a different guy), and a big guy with brown hair and glasses. We looked around at the tools and camp stuff. Got more interesting when Sam found a sword. Uncle Dan took a picture of him, and then I got the sword. Unfortunately this dictator has no idea how to hold specific swords. So I just held it in one hand and now we have a picture of a pigtailed teenager holding a sword with a ridiculous smile. I tried to scowl but failed.  CUTE IRISH GUY: Oh, very threatening, one-handed! That'll frighten the Spaniards away for sure.  [I just sorta smirked, partly cause HEWASSOCUTE and why would I want to frighten away my headquartering country?]  He asked how old everybody was - Mom said I was 15 (not yet!!).  CIG: 15? She'd be married. Nope, not yet. CIG: Can you cook? LAURA: Kinda. CIG: Can you clean? LAURA: Yeah! CIG: Can you teach? LAURA: Sorta. CIG: Have you learnt everything you can from your mother? MOM: (mutter) She thinks so. CIG: (incredulously) Then why aren't you married? [Ah, these adorable role-playing guys. I'm such a sucker.]  And apparently they threw Will Turner into apprenticeship right when they found him, because you had to be 11 or 12.  Last in this exhibit, we went to the actual museum. I saw a REAL cutlass and several boats, played around with a fake pirate pistol and found one thing that can only be expressed in a photograph. Will upload when I get the chance. Also, found a sign that said INDEED there were women pirates. Mwah.  There was also a duck shooting station. It occured to me just now that it was like shooting pigeons, except with a laser rifle. No satisfying crack. (In case you care, I have shot a real rifle. I'm terrible so far but would hopefully improve with practice.)  By the end I was starving. Everybody was. So we get out on the road. We saw a dude who was either a drifter, druggie, hobo, mentally ill, or all four. He was talkign to himself and looking at his tattoos and flexing his muscles. We stopped at a place called Big Al's and our food took FOREVER but it was awesomely good. But we had to eat quickly because we were on certain Dad-imposed time restraints. I had a burger/fries. The restaurant was 50's themed and had a huge private collection of Coke products. (It feels like I've been writing for AGES, gah.)  AFTER WE ATE, we went to see a play! *cheer* It was called The Lost Colony and the guy who wrote it has a Pulitzer. It's the first and longest running outdoor play ever (1937!!). It's told from the colonists' perspective. Language often difficult to grasp b/c of Shakespeare style. SD was lost. Then again she's only 7. The actors and their singing were quite solid and good, and the Indian dance was close to perfect. Liked it.  After it was over, we all waited for bows, but they never came. It was weird. All were incredibly exhausted when we got home, so we went to bed. Woke up again at 8:30 today - Sam wanted to watch Jurassic Park but the VCR is basically screwed.  So somebody (not me, actually) suggested POTC and I'm all, okay! and perked up... Sam seems to like it, good sign. Uncle Dan seems to like it, even better. He sensed I was a JD fan (now, how did he come to that conclusion??). He is a smart guy, very funny. Anyway - and my dad was willing to sit through it a second time. He took some of my friends and me to see it when it first came out. We're at the part where Liz is parleying herself over to the Black Pearl.  Put on sunscreen and came to the beach. It’s here that we did something fun – SD, SU, Sam, Rose, and me all stood in a line facing the beach sand. We were pretty far from shore. Anyway, you stand there and wait a second – and are suddenly brushed over by a wave! Sometimes you walk forward to avoid losing your balance (I have none) and sometimes it smacks you in the ass, and sometimes you are nearly knocked over by the force. And you feel the pull on your feet and the sand under you as it washes back out.  I should mention we had a speech about beach safety by (in my aunt’s opinion) a hot guy delivered to us at the aquarium. OMG – it’s 11:50. I’ve been writing for almost 2 hours. I ought to shut up – and now we’re going to the pool, whee! Swim till 12:20 and then eat. Be right back.  SOMETIME AFTER LUNCH. About to watch POTC again.  SOME MORE TIME. I think I’ve figured out why Jack walks the way he does – too much standing on the beach and being knocked over by waves. Time for Boggle. Mwah.  3:30 PM. Hah. I thought my mental clock was right. We played Boggle and I kept getting distracted by POTC, which was being watched by Dad and Uncle Dan.  Well, we went to the pool, and I got in b/c I was way overheated. Went in for diving sticks and then had inner tube races with SU. Went back, had lunch, watched POTC/Boggle and now I’m back at the pool writing. This chair is just plain gross.  [Insert yet another blog entry here. And then a big long spiel about Jack and Anamaria which I’ll type up someday and force you to read.]  Unbelievably, STILL no Inevitable. What I had before was just windburn. But with the Sunscreen Nazis hanging about, I’m not sure if I’ll even get red ears.  Going back to house to retrieve Anamaria story. I plan on editing… Amelia will get her own story someday. It’ll be Hillary’s Christmas present.  THURSDAY, JUNE 10, 2004  10:12 AM. About to go on bike ride with parents. Mom ASSUMED I wanted to go to coffee shop when I never said it and she already said no. And SU is SCARY at exaggeration. Just to enhance her stupid accusations, she makes things up. *is annoyed* Yes, I am “obsessed” with many things. But not like you think. I can live without them, and that is the difference.  11:00 AM. 6 MILES!! AGHK!!  My back, neck, and forehead are a little damp. I don’t get that much exercise, ever. Will go outside and fall into pool.  8:48 PM. *longs for some contact w/ somebody she’s not related to* I need my guys. And my girls. I am going to be so sore tomorrow. I’ll just dwell on HP and lounge in bed.  First of all, The Inevitable has arrived. On my legs, ears, and front. and it is making me tired and irritable. SU humming/singing DG again… gr… don’t make me hate it, girl…  Went to the beach and had much fun boogeyboarding in ocean. Read HP for a bit after lunch – then went to Kitty Hawk. What do you know. We did go after all.  Climbed up unnecessarily large sand dune/hill to see Wright Monument. Took pic. Went in v. small museum and looked at replica of airplane.  SU singing. Grrr. Jenny from the Block. I curse myself for ever burning that. And she should gimme my headphones back; I never said she could have em.  There. They’re MINE.  I didn’t know she liked my Rock Steady. Oh well. *listens* We had food at pizza place. Nearly got hysterical while there but calmed self. Went to meet Wards (cousin family) at sand dunes – “Jockey’s Ridge” as SU was kind enough to repeat 50,000 times. Went up barefoot – hard on feet but sand felt looovely. Soft, soft, soft. If it wasn’t about to storm, we would’ve stayed longer/gotten better sunset view. *sigh*  I’m tired and it’s only 8 Indiana time. I’m gonna be so off-schedule it’s not even funny.  I dearly wonder how the poor world is getting on without me. [/sarcasm]  FRIDAY, JUNE 11, 2004  8:14 PM. I don’t feel sorry for Bitch and I’m not speaking to my other four family members. If they really want to make my birthday suck, THAT’S THEIR FRICKIN PROBLEM.  SATURDAY, JUNE 12, 2004  9:02 AM. Happy Birthday to Mee!! The day when at 5 AM, this insane writer-Alias-coffee-freak was born into the equally insane universe. And I was apparently born on a Monday. I hate Mondays.  At least my dad understood… haven’t tried Mom, and BSU won’t listen. We’re going on a walk to the beach to see the waves. They’re supposedly huge.  9:18 AM. Don’t understand why they must make big ___ deal out of everything. Pisses me off. Might as well go back to sleep L  It sucks that they insist on doing this on my birthday. SUCKS!! I’m not sure about this. I might be 15 now, but it’s only been 4 hours and I’m still me. And I still cry about everything. I don’t know how I’m going to enjoy this day at all. And I think about my friends and I start to cry again because I miss them.  I’ve been thinking about my story in the past two days. I think I’ll end it with a parting in accordance to the theme. (Just a note to self.) Will probably do much brainstorming/sleeping on way home. *sigh*  I think I will go back to sleep, I’m already under the covers.  9:49 AM. It’s like B and thunderstorms. The worse I feel, the crazier the waves get. They’re ruining my birthday and they don’t even care and I can’t stand it L. And it’s all so stupid. They need to get over it. I don’t think I’m going to speak to them anymore unless I have to. It’s not worth wasting my time. *needs hug*  12:40 PM. Feeling better – went and rode bikes with Dad. Bought some stuff and went back to coffee place - got something called Mucky Duck. [The town we’re in is called Duck, by the way.] It was espresso, whipped cream, chocolate, caramel and other wonderful spirit-lifting stuff. See, the only problem is that right now, my tongue is SEARING with pain of being burned. *sticks it out and sucks air* Not pretty. But at least I feel better… less tired anyway.  Being civil to SBSU and Mom – not speaking to them much. Am determined to have semi-happy birthday. Have worked out agreement just now with SU. I will tell her when she’s bothering me and she will back off. V. simple and (hopefully) effective.  [NOT.]  Tongue still burns. Ohhh… *winces* Espresso is a wonderful thing, you know. I’m afraid that when I come back, Hillary will be standing in a pile of rubble and telling me everyone’s off killing each other. Then we can go to the movies :-P Everything bad seems to happen when I leave town!! Augh!! I can’t take the suspense. I want a detailed email explaining everything that went on while I was gone.  I have reached 72 pages in pink journal on this trip alone. That’s about 3 times as big as the Indy trip Chronicles.  Just remembered – the water was very clear yesterday, probably because of the storm. Uncle Dan, SU, Dad, and I were all in deeper water looking for shells. Found some very cool ones. Then we got out the GOGGLES! YAY! and swam around, scattering thousands of ugly little fish all over the place. Learned art of body surfing and watched Dad/Dan boogeyboarding (still can’t spell that.) Rather funny. One thing that is cool to do: sit underwater facing the beach and watch the waves roll over you. It’s so weird. A little line goes over you and moves you forward. And sometimes you see little crabs walking along under you.  ABOUT 2 PM. SU IS SCHIZO!! She walked up while we were walking to this dock where the Sound is. She’s all, I’m telling your b-day present – if you want to go see Harry Potter with your friends or something I’ll give you the $ for the ticket.  Unbelievable. And I’m like, um… that’s creative. Cause I couldn’t think of anything else to say, you know? So we walk (except for Dad and Aunt Rose) to look at the Sound. There was a little dock that we stood on and looked. The water was very brown and murky and lake-ish. Somebody had hung two cages on ropes – we pulled them up and both of them had three crabs each! Funky, big, blueish. Scares SD b/c they move like spiders.  There were two people sitting on a bench on the dock: older dude with gray hair, tan body, and no shirt – and other (I thought rather cute) young guy. Black, Elliot-length curly hair, green and gray t-shirt, cargo shorts and sandals. Didn’t say a word but was probably 17 or so. *sigh* I liked him. There are so many lovely guys on this island – I will have to live here someday. Tan Guy and Co. were from Pittsburg and TG and Dan talked… I stared at Curly Guy and then we went home. Sound was not very exciting.  When we got home, Aunt Rose was back and gave me part of my b-day present – FUDGE and a funny card. And she brought much more candy and things. That made me happy. She said she’d take me shopping if we go to Indy for Fathers’ Day. I think I know what I want… *smiles and thinks of Jack Sparrow’s lovely coverbox face* [Okay, so I didn’t get Pirates, but I’m still saving, dammit.]  It’s quite chilly out here. We’re sitting out on the beach for what is possibly the last time. The waves are HUGE. Overlapping each other, white foam everywhere, constantly growing – you can’t see a spot without a wave. Even at the very tip of the ocean that’s visible has little white spots appearing.  We saw a few dolphins one day. Far out but still there. Very few people are in the water right now, but most of them are male. That might say something. There are about four shades of blue on the ocean right now. Deep blue on the edge, green-blue, brown-blue, and murky green closest to me. But that one is partially concealed by white marshmallow foam. Dad flew a kite for awhile and Sam/SU have halfway buried themselves. I should mention the convo that was had on the way back from the Sound.  SD: I don’t want to get in the water. MOM: But you have to put on your swimsuit if you’re going to sit in the sand and build a castle. SD: I don’t want to build a castle. MOM: Then what do you want to do? SD: Sit on my towel and play with my hands.  See, as bratty as she can be, occasionally she can be almost cute. Like when we were on the dock she said she’s going to call me Bubbo. I kept calling her Bubba and then we decided she’d only be Bubba at the pool. Some. Times. She’s. Just. Cute. Like a bunny.  We all scooted our towels and beach mats back because the water’s getting even higher. A kite nearly fell on me. Most people are just sitting and staring at the ocean. I’m wearing my dad’s t-shirt over my bathing suit … I’m very cold. I think we’re having pizza tonight… SU asked what I wanted and ran to tell Wards. I think she was prepared to whine to me if I didn’t pick it, but I want it anyway.  I’m out of things to say for now… going to relax in sun.  LATER. Took walk on beach with SU and Wards. Sand sticking to my toes. Hee. Wow. Water rising. *sigh* Sam is going to bury my feet. *frown* I’m hungry. But there’s no food. Goodbye for now.  5:18 PM. I devoured a bowl of Cheerios an hour ago – I was almost shaking from hunger… then I read my aunt’s two magazines… Allure and Good Housekeeping, joy. At least JG had the cover story. But Kelly Ripa is everywhere and I’m so sick of her.  Everyone (excluding me, mom, Aunt Rose, and Uncle Dan) is at the pool. I am becoming restless – there is NOTHING to do… and anything I could do, I want to save for the drive. We won’t be home until 12 midnight. I think I’ll screw myself out of a lot of sleep so I’ll spend most of the boring drive out of it.  I do have 4 dollars and that coffee shop is still open and it still has Internet access. I’ve gone nearly a week without a computer (or church, gah… will have to go to confession) and it’s finally taking its toll. I keep thinking about all the stuff I have to catch up on and do – that computer is so mine on Monday. If I don’t eat – you’ll know why.  Kidlets are back. Doubt they’ll be interesting. At least they add noise. (I can’t believe I just said that.)  An hour or so before we go to have pizza. Don’t think I can stand the boredom – at least I have something to write on …  Dan is watching golf, can’t watch TV, there’s no DVD player in Rose’s room and I think she’s watching something too. And I’m still cold.  10:22 PM. Well, we went to Stone Oven Pizza – yumness. And after that we went and looked around the shops. I swear, I find the strangest places. Every single one of those shops must’ve had tarot cards. Michael, you would have been in heaven… went back to Wings store and got two ankle bracelets for souvenirs. Meehee.  *SIGH* Aunt Rose turned on the TV around 9 and Grease was on. Apparently she owns the record. Her and my mother, augh, sang every song we saw. It was just so terrible! and SU was there too… this birthday has been absolutely schizo… goodnight *is 15*  SUNDAY, JUNE 13, 2004  8:18 AM. (our time! whoo!) *is very tired* We’re rolling out the garage of our home, Summer Daze… going down Dianne Street… going down Duck Road…  Wow. This vacation has been action-packed, for lack of a better adjective. The Wards left about ½ hour before we did, because we were waiting on the dishwasher.  We’re sitting next to a big black Hummer in the rental office parking lot. [We were there when we arrived in Duck, too. We were looking for a place to eat, but everything seems to close before 8! I don’t remember what we ended up eating. Also, Aunt Rose and I were on a fudge hunt one evening… it was great.]  The name of the neighborhood is Northpoint.  9:56 AM. We’re on a bridge going through Chesapeake Bay. Radio has frizzled out.  11:04 AM. SU and SD smacking each other with waterbottles… I sit staring at the highway procrastinating. Doubt I could concentrate anyway. SD’s laugh is v. grating.  3:52 PM. I will not get motion sickness, I will not get motion sickness, I will not get motion sickness.  7:36 PM. We ate at Cracker Barrel tonight and I obsessed over the peg puzzle for the entire meal. I think I do have a touch of OCD – or else I’m just terribly perfectionistic. But they tend to go hand in hand.  We have listened to Josh Groban, Clint Black, Matilda on CD recording, How to Eat Fried Worms on CD recording, and now Kenny Chesney. Three of those are my mother’s and combined, I’ve heard them all more than Wicked and Rent combined. Yep – that. Damn. Much. I’m dying to listen to Rent now, but I’m nearly out of battery juice. Kenny’s okay for now.  My mom, thank the heavens, gave me her book she finished. Anna Quindlen’s “Object Lessons.” It’s rather good, but I think I would enjoy it more if I could stop thinking about the computer.  Our hamster has taken refuge with our neighbors, Brenden and Claire Murphy. We’re only halfway through Ohio and I’m fairly itching to be back home…  Sometimes when you lie on the beach with your eyes closed, you can see the waves.  8:48 PM. V. dark… can’t see what I’m writing. Storming like hell… cleared enough to see road but still amazing. Trying to listen to Rent but storm droning it out.  10:10 PM. Back through Van Wert and so v. tired. Want to go to bed.  10:57 PM. Rolling along dear old St. Joe Ctr. Road. Can’t see a bloody thing! *smiles* The Wyndemere sign!! Whoo!! Rolling… *waves to Hillary and Diana*  Oh, hello, house J  You’ve been a great audience, really… goodnight!!
