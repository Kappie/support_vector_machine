So, I was looking around on IMDB and I found out that Jerry Cantrell was in  Jerry Maguire , with one line and everything. He was  Jesus at the CopyMat , or so  urlLink IMDB  says.    AND THE INFAMOUS LINE     "That's the way to become great, just hang your balls right out there."       JERRY!     That's all friends. YES.
