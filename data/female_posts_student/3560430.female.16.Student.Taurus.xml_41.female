Whay does the key board in my room hate me? Why aren't I listening to the musc that I put on that is playing in my room? Why aren't I finished reading Queen of the damned? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY???       'Cause.      Well I'm kind of sore and hungry so I'd best go back to writing. It just doesn't feel right though. I think that these are pages that other pages will be built off of. It's just they are so blah. Maybe I'll have to rewrite them later. I don't know. They just don't feel right! Ah! I don't like this not feeling right I want it to be good the first time around! Well maybe they just don't sound right to me... Maybe they will sound better to other people. Maybe. I don't know, this is really very very frustrating!!!!!!!!!!      GARABLEDE GOOBLEY!       FLING FLANG RANDOME SWEAR WORDS!!!      Hu. It'll be better if I get through this and just finish this bit and then move on. I think that if I just get past this then it will all be good. Sigh. It's just really really hard.
