SpeedRacr13: between jerry porter and josh reed, who should i put in? FireDancyr7: Josh Reed SpeedRacr13: thanks, have a good lunch :-) FireDancyr7: i think jeff is soooo sexy.  what do you think? SpeedRacr13: sure, why not SpeedRacr13: especially his traps FireDancyr7: they are so big now.  It looks like he has boulders sitting on his shoulders SpeedRacr13: someday he will achieve bret status, and then they will truly be huge and he will be so cool and everyone will love him FireDancyr7: Instead of everyone lusting for him. SpeedRacr13: i was thinking more along the lines of dry-heaving when they see him SpeedRacr13: haha FireDancyr7: You are right his traps are so big people get nausious.  Not like you, you trapless wonder SpeedRacr13: people have to take oxygen tanks to get to the top of mine, they are like two mt everests on my shoulders FireDancyr7: I heard Ben hit you in the face and your traps werent strong enought to hold your head in place. SpeedRacr13: no, ben hit my decoy face, the one that i had painted on my traps and because my traps were so freakin huge he thought it was the real me...meanwhile i was in between those babies calmly reading a magazine FireDancyr7: you can read? Can you tell time on your Hulk watch? SpeedRacr13: ouch, you always have to take it that one step farther and someones feelings get hurt...hulk sad FireDancyr7: Hulk just play.  When I heard you didn't have watch too.........I ate mine. SpeedRacr13: hahaha...oh i will have this watch my friend, dont you worry about that FireDancyr7: I guess I will need to crap mine out then.
