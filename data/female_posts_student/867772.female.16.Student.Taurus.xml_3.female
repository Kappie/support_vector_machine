I was expected to say "He/she/they can't come to the phone right now. May I take a message?". This drilled into my head the impression that if anyone did call for my parents while they weren't home, they were hiding in the bush out front, waiting for the cue to come kidnap me.   Whenever my mom or dad had to leave the house, I sat in the front window waving until I couldn't see their car anymore. I think they thought it was because I couldn't bare to see them leave, but I was actually waiting for my kidnapper to pop out of the bushes.  I don't remember when I stopped waving.
