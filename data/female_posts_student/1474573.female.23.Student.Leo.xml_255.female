I went home for lunch, grilled up a hotdog, watered the plants and my barrel o' flowers, looked at the budding trees and just kinda giggled to myself at how great my life is right now.  I mean, sure I have a spanish test tomorrow that I havent studied for, and sure, its almost time for my review at work and I'm a little nervous, and okay, so I'm a fat bastid now, but overall, I cant complain!     Life is goooooood...
