I took our chem review test they took yesterday. I ended up getting 25 wrong... out of 40. IT'S FINE. English was pretty good. Kristen and Katie presented their projects. Sam compared Allen Ginsberg to Eminem. Yes, it's cause they are exactly the same. As Erica said, "Cause Eminem hates gays and Ginsberg is gay!" RIGHT... actually Sam was nice to me today, and I feel bad cause I say mean things about her sometimes. She's just one of those people you love and hate at the same time. She's nice, but can drive you up the wall. Anyways, we had a math test today. It was our last one, therefore the hardest. It was hard, okay it was just hard. I thought I was going to go crazy in History. It was our last day of notes, thank god, but I just wanted him to be done. I really thought I was going to pull a  Mean Girls  and jump over the table and attack Mr. O like a hyena, or perhaps, a lion? FIND THAT DAMN LION COPS-I MEAN JESUS, IF IT IS REAL, HOW THE HELL CAN YOU NOT FIND A LION? We finally finished our notes, and then I gave my Elvis power point presentation. It went alright. Chem was not any better. My muscles kept tightening. I just couldn't take going over our test, I just wanted to scream, so I shouted "DOC I just can't anymore! My muscles are tightening and I just want to SCREAM. Every period has been awful. I can't concentrate, I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!" After class he started to chase me around the room, threatening to tickle me, which I hate, if I didn't scream and get out my frustration. I did a little, but then ran out the door. Worked on Spanish a bit fifth period and then watched the other group's presentation sixth period. Good job girls! Señora is just awful. We saw her sister yesterday at Academy, and today I told her that. She was like, "OOH we are just so edifferent. I mean they esay that I am the epreppy one. But oh I don't eknow. One day I saw mea sista and she was awearing abrown pants, brown shirt, and a brown sweater. I mean she was alost in the ebrown! When I go to their aparties they just look so eplain. I call up my daughter and esay, 'Did you esee what they were awearing?!'" Yes, these our your sisters, you'd think blood is thicker than fashion, but apparently NOT! If you saw me seventh and eighth periods, then you know my frustrations. I was freaking out! Our Spanish project is just so stressful! We were running back and forth between her room to get things checked and the computer room. ECBC and I were just laughing hysterically, cause we were just that stressed. Señor MADE us come to his room and tell him about the AP test, but I was so stressed by that, he was mean too. DAMN YOU. Every time I'd try and print something, the printer would start printing 1000 pages of something else. I was screaming at it and going crazy in the lab, and I threatened some freshman, oops! I had to leave and go pick up ice cream for tutoring, Liz, Meghan, and Char Char came with me. I was so stressed and was swearing at everybody. They were annoyoed, but I was really CRAZY, and high on the evil Spanish project weed. I don't know, I just made that up. Tutoring was pretty good. I was sticky from all the ice cream. The kids were good, I'll miss some of them. I'm missing Melvin as we speak, I love you Melvin! Well... I think that's all the good times, probably not cause these days are so stressful and just too funny! AHH well I'm out to wash my feet. Adios!
