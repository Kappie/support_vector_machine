Oh well I guess we all have to go with what our brains tell us, let's just hope they haven't been totally fried by revision! Anyhooo life so far - I kinda broke my wardrobe; the door, the draws, the pole thingy that you hang clothes on. Ooops. So that means I have to go Ikea shopping! Yeay! It's such a freaky place though! Never mind... I can buy a really cool strange lamp or something. Oh, and I broke my toe and it's all red/purple down the side :( Nowchie! Eww and then at night I have a banana strapped to it and in the morning my foot is washed with tea tree oil. Niiiice. Oh that's not cause my toe's broken, it's for veruccas. So life is weird. Like always. Kinda nice and refreshing, maybe the future is worth the wait.
