Duane something.    I have to say I was relatively disappointed with Gothika because it's like everything I've seen before...it's  The Sixth Sense  meets  Stir of Echoes  with a little  What Lies Beneath  thrown in for good measure.  It was thrilling in some parts but on a whole it just didn't work for me.  And Penelope Cruz was in it for like 3 seconds, although the trailer made it seem like she was an important character.  PUHLEESE.    The Rundown, on the other hand, was quite entertaining!  The Rock is cute, clever and witty!  I think I have a little crush on him! (ooh lala) I guess I was happy because the movie wasn't trying to be anything but entertaining, y'know?  Oh!  And Stifler's in it as the guy who's being pursued.  He's funny.  What's his real name?  Sean somethingorother.  And dammit if he doesn't have a nice little figure on him! (don't I sound like a horny little old lady?!)  Sheeeeiiiiit!! I forgot to promote my brother-in-law's show,  ANIMAL FACE OFF!  on The Discovery Channel.  It was on last night.  Hey, if you catch reruns he's Dan, the cute marine biologist who talks a lot of smack about how Sharks are the 'ultimate predator' and all that.  He's in Shark vs. Crocodile and Shark vs. Hippo.  Different types of sharks, same smack talkin'... :-)  And speaking of television *which I KNOW I watch WAAAY too much of* I have come to the conclusion that my favorite show of late is, hands down,  Significant Others  on Bravo.  It is soooo fuckin' funny that I almost pee my pants laughing every time I watch it.  Three couples are in therapy, all have been married different amounts of time and it's just them talking about their problems and then it goes into their lives outside therapy and I mean, I cant even explain how funny it is.  Like one couple has been married only three months and its obvious that they didn't know each other that well before getting married and the husband freaks out when he finds out she's slept with like, 200 guys... yeah, its like that.  Okay, maybe you just have to watch it for yourself to get how funny it is.  I'm definitely not doing it justice.  Anyhoo, that was pretty much it for my Sunday.  Never did clean that bathroom... heh.
