I hope it's Portugal.   4 June. 5:00am   Greece takes it all.  But I'm not sad. For all their effort and skill they deserved to win every bit. Their defense unit was impenetrable, making scoring a hell lot tougher for Portugal. Ronaldo on the other hand, totally screwed up today's match. What captured my attention was when some crazy fellow dashed out into the field 10 minutes before full time. He looked like one of Portugal's supporters but I couldn't really see what was on the cloth he was waving. After throwing it at the players, he ran like a mad man on the lose head on into the goal where the officials caught him. Nuts, he was still waving and cheering when they carried him off.
