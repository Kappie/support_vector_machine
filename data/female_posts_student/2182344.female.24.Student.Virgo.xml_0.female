I can't remember the last time that I felt so bad that I simply layed on the couch for the entire day.  I have some sort of a sinus thing going on, and it seems to have completely handicapped me.  I can't concentrate, I can't smell, I can't make a decision, and I feel totally ambivalent to everything going on around me.  I should call in tomorrow because I doubt that I'll be able to work efficiently.  However, the guilt of calling in, regardless of how bad I actually feel, will prevent me from actually doing so.  My co-workers wouldn't be concerned with how I'm feeling, they'd only be concerned with how my absence is affecting them.   I tried to go to the Jenny Toomey show with a friend last night.  The person who suggested that I go, told me that the show began at 7:30.  I thought that it was a bit early, but it was a Monday night, so I didn't question the time.  When we got to the club, there was a sign on the door that read:  "doors at 9, show at 9:30".  So, we left.  My friend has two young children and she was already worried about getting home at a decent time.  We went to a fabric store and bought knitting equipment and a how to book, and then grabbed a bite to eat.  I guess that I still could have gone to the show without her, but by the time that I got home, and she drove off, all that I wanted to do was get into my pajamas (of which I am still in) and go to bed.  This sinus stuff is really getting the best of me.  It doesn't usually hit me this early in the year, so I hope that it doesn't mean that I'll be dealing with it again in December or January.  It was Christmas last year, and I was miserable.    The Joe Schmo show is coming on in ten minutes.  It's the last one when Matt (Joe Schmo) finds out that it was all fake.  That show cracks me up!  It's hilarious.  Whoever came up with it was brilliant.  I've seen most of the episodes, and I wonder how he hasn't caught on.  Some of the stuff that they did was so bizarre that it seems like he would have thought something was up.  But, of course, who on earth would ever think that they had gotten themselves into a situation like that.  It's sad that it's ending tonight.  I don't think that they'll be able to pull it off again.  Man, it's FUNNY!!!  Well, I guess I'll end this entry here for today - gotta get to tv in time for Joe Schmo!
