Problems of the week:   1) Jack is begining to grate on my nerves. Call me fickle, call me a bitch, just don't call me three times a day. He's too interested in me. He's a nice guy but can be really annoying. He swears more than I do. And the way he says "fuck" sounds like an out-of-tune snare drum and that is miked to closely. He has an anger management problem, not in the typical sense (i.e., can't control his outbursts) but in the same way that a band hasa management problem when the manager overpromotes and books shows at absurdly out-0f-character venues. Jack thinks anger iscool, self destructive behavior too; he cultivates his bad boy look. Cant stand that. And, of course, he is the exact opposite of david. who is outwardly calm even when he is under extreme stress or in deep depression or feeling raging anger. It's funny that I should complain about Jack's facade as I am, afterall, the secret slob. But the problem with hypocricy is not that the hypocrite believes one thing to be right but acts in a contradictory manner; the problem is that the hypocrite doesn't do the right thing. Period. I may bea hypocrite for calling Jack out on his facade,but the real criticism is that I am a fraud myself.   2) I have started an affair with another co-worker. Please! someone stop me before I date again. Seriously. Jack and I are on the down-low and so are Mr. NYU and I. Mr. NYU knows about Jack, but not vice versa, but since Mr. NYU has a ms. girlfriend, i don't i am in danger of him devulging my secret.   3) Theft. I am not cheating on David. I am betraying nothing except my own sense of loyalty to him. I am however stealing from an innocent party: Mr. NYU's Miss. Girlfriend.
