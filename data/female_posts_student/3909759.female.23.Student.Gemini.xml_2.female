Now, I am thinking about my beautiful cigarettes.I shared mylongest relationship with cigarettes...  I started smoking them when I was 16 and they've been there for me ever since:  they've been there for me at various concerts, they've started a many conversations with folks I've never talked to before, they've been my comfort in sour times, they've been part of my daily breakfast (along with a cup of coffee),they've kept me company in cafes across Europe, they've been my perfect prop when I played Bohemian writer - sitting in the corner of a smokey cafe listening to deary jazz music as I write over dim candle light with a carafe of red wine....   I'll miss smoking.  It's really quite an art.
