National Youth Court Conference craziness everywhere I turn, Communications was all over my ass about who was emailing me about the Sheriff's Office "intelligence", I had to deal with the fallout of yesterday's anger management group catastrophe, there's always fun when DCFS is involved, the travel industry is officially going to hell, the drama of the cell phone curse continues, and I am still awaiting the day when I walk into an Intake Interview and both the parent and the child accept and admit responsibility for their actions.  Jeez.  A gigantic SPLAT could be heard in my apartment last night around 10:30 or so.  That was when the shit hit the fan regarding the email I sent to the debate list.  "Blah blah blah, let's make personal attacks on Danielle because on some subconscious level we know she's right, blah blah blah."  Now Bo wants me kicked off the list because I cursed.  Hmm...what's that it says in SG rules about not being under the influence of illict substances whilst a member of an SG funded organization?  Hmmm....  In all honesty, the comments of the teammates really are more amusing than anything else.  They would be more incindiary were they from people who actually knew me now.    They do however cause me to contemplate what my life would be like if I actually gave a shit about what the groundlings thought of me...hmm...nah, far too much work, bullshitting and false niceities for me.  I'd rather be hated than adored.  It's much easier to fall off a pedestal.
