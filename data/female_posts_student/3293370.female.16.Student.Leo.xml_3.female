He didn't try and pull anything. We just sat there talking and cuddling. It was AWESOME. Sigh. I think its all too good to be true, but I hope it's not. I'm so happy, I found a winner.  And, assuming Aunty Su lets me, I'm going to grad with him!!!!!!! WATCH OUT GRAD 2004, HERE COMES CYNDI!!!!!!!!!!
