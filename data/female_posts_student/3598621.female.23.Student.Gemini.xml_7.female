They cannot be someone else's goals like those of your boss, parents, or even your spouse. They must be yours and they must be of value to you.   - Success is a developing attitude of achieving goals. But what is an attitude? An attitude is the way we think or feel about a subject which then causes us to act in a certain way about it. Therefore, we act and react in relation to our thought patterns which we have developed about the subject.   So an attitude is caused when we think about something the same way over and over until it becomes automatic. The resulting actions in response to the thought also become automatic.   Change the habit of thought and you change the attitude. Change the attitude and you change the resulting action.
