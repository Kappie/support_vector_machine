On this day, at 4:58 p.m. I came howling into the world with a voice so clear and loud that my mother could hear me through her sedation; now they have epidurals for the pain, back then they practically knocked women out with gas and medication.  I’m not sure what to think at the moment, or should I say that I’m not quite sure how to parse it all out and write it.  It has nothing to do with growing old. My family has a history of not only making it into their nineties, and doing so with a lot of vim, vigor, and mental cohesion. In short, the only thing that kills in my family is disease, or the occasional accident. So, needless to say, being thirty-four still means I’m a “kid.”  I do have to admit, though, that as of late my mind has steered very much towards time and change as it is found in people’s lives, as well as the perceptions tied to them. Before the discovery of my grandparents’ love-letters during World War II, while my mother was putting things into storage for her future move, well, being the snoop that I am, I took the liberty of going into our family photo box.  Some people do genealogies to find out who they were related to, but for me, you might say I was doing a genealogy on myself, a kind of personal history. Actually, I should clarify and say that I am doing a genealogy of myself, present tense.  What I mean is this. I am rediscovering and remembering who I was growing up, finding old photos and trying to place an age to them, how old I was, what was going on that year. It’s a kind of research that both challenges both the personal memory as well as the normal research structure. While historians look at writings, and archaeologists look at artifacts and the settings they were found in, I’m having to work with my own memory.  I am also having to contend with a few other things, mainly realizations and discoveries.  Looking at old photographs from when I was a child, it’s hard to believe it was me. Back then I was vigorous, energetic, and slender showing absolutely no signs of the overweight woman I was to become. I have to admit, looking at the pictures, there’s a kind of mental separation, as if I’m looking at the photos of someone else, some other soul. More than a few times I look at them and wish that I had a child like that, a little, smiling, red-headed bundle of energy full of laughter and covered with freckles (I freckle less nowadays and burn more). It’s me, though, and there’s no doubt in my mind about it, even now my two front teeth are ever so slightly crooked, and one has a small chip out of it (slipped in the shower when I was eight or so and knocked it against the wall, all the dentist could do then was smooth it out).  The thing about archaeologists is that we live our lives working with the past, and always with the past of other people be it the rare individual or more normally a whole community, if not a whole culture. Even as a young girl I loved the past, from my days wrapped up in ancient Egyptian books to Greek gods and long-ago Rome. And yet I still love my present day sciences, downloading images online from the Hubble Telescope like a madwoman, and trying to learn new languages. I see the future, and it is rooted on the foundations of the past, on the people of the past, building, learning, creating, inventing, and above all passing on their knowledge. Some see the present and either don’t know about the underlying layers of history and knowledge, or have forgotten about them.  Example: Someone found out that  seventy-five parts saltpeter (potassium nitrate) finely ground, fifteen parts charcoal, and ten parts sulfur combined made an explosive compound later called gunpowder (75% Potassium Nitrate(KNO3) + 10% Sulphur (S) + 15% Carbon (C)). Since then, aside from neat fireworks and idiot-proof guns, it’s lead into the creation of rockets to launch items for space exploration as well as the science of aeronautics.  And so it goes, I dig for the layers underneath, to find the history that hopefully won’t be forgotten, or if it has, to bring it to light again.
