And before I could suffer an amnesia, that day was right on Saturday.  With me is my sister and 'um my couzin (fave couzin).  We just have a li'l walked in the mall.  Enjoyed each others company and laugh out loud to some folks who we found really weird.    When, we're about to commute to go home (since it'll be 5:00pm and we'll still watch SCQ)we have saw a guy who's hair was   "dreads"  .  Honest to death, I'm pretty afraid with this guy because of his hair!  Hmmm...he's cute but with that hair it's a turn off!  What else? Oh My GoD, he (with her americanized gf) was also in the jeepney we used to ride on!  Next, we stopped to a shoe store.  My sister wanted to buy but she haven't found the perfect shoes to fit her giant feet! LOL...but anyways, we still look for one.  Just then my couzin saw a big shoe and tried it!  It was like those shoes wear by prosties! He,he... then we went home and play cards!
