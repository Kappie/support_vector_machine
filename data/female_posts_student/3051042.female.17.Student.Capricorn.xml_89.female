Certain words destroy things so quickly, and I'm not about to let that happen.  Maybe subliminal messages. Maybe blunt honesty. Maybe maybe maybe... everything is a maybe right now. And it's sort of disturbing but fun. I go to sleep thinking, 'I'll figure it out in the morning.' But then I wake up and everything just sort of stays where it was earlier. Until new subjects are brought up and new information is released. After that, it just gets a tad more confusing but I just let it go like everything else. I've become so carefree to situations like this, it's delightful.   I don't know the ending to the story, but I will leave you all with these philosophical (hardly philosophical) words:  "MtDewGirl87: I didn't think it was my style; but hey, there's a chance for everything... life is made up of new experiences, and I'm ready for it all... bring it on."  I think I can handle this. If not, I hide things very well from myself.
