And hanging out with her friends, all of whom seem very cool and were very welcoming, but not to the point of being annoyingly nice-do you know what I mean? I hope you do. Anyhoo, I think her and Devin are just darling together, and epitomize what a healthy relationship should look like. I'm so glad Krissa has finally found a nice guy who treats her well-it's what any self-respecting girl should expect, after all. :o)        The DNC started tonight. I don't really have anything to say about it, but there you go. Both candidates annoy me, but the conventions are fun to watch. I stilldon't know who I'm voting for. Probably Bush, but only because Kerry annoys the hell out of me. That, and I have a bet riding on it. However, if you ask me who I really like, I'll tell you: it's all about McCain.        Finally, not much else new EXCEPT: I bought a car today! It's a 2001 Chevy Impala and it's gorgeous. It is EXACTLY what I was looking for and I got really lucky to find one used, yet in great condition. With that said, I'm really tired, so I'm gonna hit the sack. More later.
