Next year is going to be amazing fun since I'm in there now :)  The Galleria was so much fun!! That cheesecake at the jewish deli was amazing!! I just wish I had money.. there were some very cute PUMAS!! lol Melissa.. that trolli man was pretty hot.. lol  People surprise me everyday..  All my friends are so amazing, and I am so lucky to have you guys!! Thanks so much for always being there through all the drama I go through. You've made this year worth while, and I'm looking forward to all the fun we're going to have this summer!!  So here's my sad story.. This morning leaving Starbuck's the Graduation song by Vitamin C came on the radio, and as I was singing I started crying. Even though I am thrilled to death that it's summer, it's still sad that the '04 year has come to an end. I mean no more crazy days with Coach Garwick criticizing my love life, and no more sharing food with Katelyn during lunch. Sure next year is going to have even more wonderful memories in store for me, but I'm going to miss the old ones.  Well I need to get back to studying. Bye guys I love you all and promise to have fun at those fun days without me :)  Jess
