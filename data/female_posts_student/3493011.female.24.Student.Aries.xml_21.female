Of cos, it'll be a joy to snuggle next to my beloved and to give him a morning kiss...  I remember before he left, I was juz next to him in the morning, not wanting to let him know that I was awake.. I took a little peek with one eye shut.. admiring his sharp features under the morning glow.. In my heart, I know that this is the guy to be with forever... Sounds like a fairytale but neverthelss I'll treasure every minute I've with him.. I love to push my nose against his arms and slowly he'll turn to his side to gimme a little squeeze.. how sweet..  Juz got off the phone wif mummy, talk abt him all over again juz so excited... Mum agrees that this is the best peroid tt a couple can have.. somehow in her voice I know it reminds her of her past.. maybe dad as well.. When I was younger, I remember mum gushes as each time she recaptures the days when dad was wooing her and of cos there are entourages around mum.. mum was a babe then, short skirts on a sensous body who can resist... Dad will come in his Vespa to grandma's hse and from a distance, mum can hear the cluttering engine of the scooter (heehee, Cliff Richard was hot, perhaps, mum was psychoed by dad's Vespa) Mum rejected her band boy suitor for dad.. and I lamented that if mum has gotten wif a band boy, I think I'll be a cool chick on drums (hmm... how can I think of tt cos I won't be here if they were together) Instead, she chose a poor kampong boy...  Similarly, I took on most of mum's charateristics like "wearing my heart on my sleeve" and "going for true love rather than looks or material possessions". In my life, I reckon I have the hidden desire to re-lived my parent's past.. I once did an research paper on Vespa and adores one; I love talented musicians (my baby is a bassist); I love watch sports on telly (dad's influence with a can of beer in hand, how Homer); I love to be independent and strong-willed (like dad) but with mum's sacrificing love and care for her man and family...     A blissful picture painted under my imagination but reality is cruel... Let's play Happy Family...
