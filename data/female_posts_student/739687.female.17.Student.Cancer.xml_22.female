This isn’t how it’s supposed to be You shouldn’t be on my mind I’m supposed to be thinking of someone else But still you’re all I find.  Your memory shouldn’t make me smile I shouldn’t see your face I’m not supposed to hear your voice But it’s all so hard to erase.  This isn’t right to reminisce Of how things used to be Getting over you is a winning battle But I’m losing, can’t you see?  This isn’t how it’s supposed to be Your thoughts should be a bore You’ve been gone so long, and this isn’t right I shouldn’t love you anymore.    She’s all alone and the world’s asleep You can’t imagine what it’s like to keep All those feelings she’s stored inside her heart And even in her dreams, they never part.  She’s wrapped up in a world of lies With angry words and hurtful goodbyes And she wonders if people will ever know About the heart she’s afraid to show.  Through all the pain she’ll never admit That yet again, her heart has been hit That heart that once drowned in warmth and gold Day by day, turns dark and cold.  And on this night she stops to think Of how she allowed herself to sink Her heart is clouded with the falling snow Casting out the sunshine she’ll never know.    Well, I figure that I shouldn't bore you too much with any more as of now. If you like, or dislike, let me know, ok? I'll possibly post more later, depending on the response.
