In social we watched a movie and in CALM we had a sub.  Interesting day wasn't it?!?  I have another chem quiz tommorow but I feel confident about this one.  Now that I have cried and whinned and complaned about not understanding all my frustration has led me to somehow understand this stuff.  It feels sooooo good to understand and I 84% on the quiz I thought I was going to fail.  I thought I didn't understand, but obviously I do and now I feel like I understandd too!  I just have to keep this up now.  This is my chance to bring up my chem mark.  This is my opportunity.  It's the last week before finals and well I know for sure that I can raise my mark for sure.  I have to make honors.  I worked too hard not to make it.  I have to do good and I really believe that I can do good.
