I know I haven't been on in ages, but I think it's fair to say that I'm weak enough again to sign back on and update this sad chronology of my emotional distress.  This is probably the first day since Nick passed away that I've been less stoned-looking/mopey and more approachable. To be honest, I still cannot believe that Nick's gone. I regret so much that we were all so selfish that we couldn't stay another 15 minutes and see him for what was to be the very last time...I think the last time I must have seen him in the flesh was last June but he continually pops up in MT conversations and otherwise.   And this whole thing has made me think about what Nick meant to me. Betty at the hospital, bless her!, thought it was someone really really close. I mean, I knew Nick and loved him just as everyone else did. How could you not love someone who was so comfortably male and cosmopolitan at the same time? How could you not smile at his talent for acting and making people laugh? his obsession with Burberry? He is one of those characters in my life who are so unabashedly vibrant and so fundamentally perfect that you just can't let go of them. Veronique is another person. So is Adam Borelli, though I never knew him well. Wow, that's pretty sad. I can't think of more people in my generation like that.  So it happens that for the first time ever in my mock trial life, there will be no Nick Salyers with his Burberry scarf and his Starbucks telling us all how we'd better shape up before competition or else we'd lose. There will be no Nick pep talks, no Nick jokes from him, though there will be plenty happy memories of him. Only now do I see all the ways in which he has shared a smile, a laugh, a life. It makes me want to be that kind of universally-admired person, though already the shoes are so hard to fill.  I'm actually not that busy today. It's a down day, and it's especially light since we're on the edge of finals. The only after-school obligation today was running make up laps. I think I should have a 95 right now, and if it's still a B I am not going to be a happy camper. Tomorrow promises to be worse, though. I have over two hours of tutoring--how I always dread it before it happens and smile after it does!--and orchestra. Plus, I'd like to have time to come home, sit down and eat.  And another emotional stinker: Charlemagne has revived the stupid charges against me and I've dragged Ryan into the fray. As usual, I've gotten mad at him first and most directly, and I'm starting to alienate people. MY FAULTS: that I am an arrogant, selfish, pathetic whiner, that I assume that I'm better than everyone else, that I have no right to be calling myself "stupid" or anything of the sort when I also happen to be mad at myself. I am also rude and unfriendly and you could probably toss in more unpleasant qualities to make an evil Lydia salad.   I do not understand her or her sudden impulse to start mothering me and telling me everything I am doing wrong--from her point of view, no less! Dude, I'm sorry if it's junior year and if life is getting harder and harder for all of us, and we all have to complain, and I can't say that all of us are civil to each other all of the time. But I see no reason for catty notes and bitchfight-esque emails. Honestly, I think the whole situation is so immature that I will not change myself for her sake, nor will I respond. In the case that she's really itching for an angry letter of her own to read, she can just go and look in my journal. I am so terribly sorry when I just have different goals, that I'd rather be doing something else than whatever she's doing.  Obviously, I don't care what she says, for she has little right to be doing so and she cannot say herself that she is not guilty of being rude and eccentric and inconsiderate and whiny at times as well. It's stupid--never in my life have I gotten such a complete, such a childish attack on my character. Accordingly, she can go write more angry letters if it REALLY makes her feel better but it's not like I'm going to change as she wants me to and just be friends with her again only to receive more bitchiness down the line.   And so it is that I am withdrawing into my little unsociable hole. My good friends can be counted on two hands, and as the days go by I am starting to eliminate fingers. Strangely, it doesn't really bother me, for after the loss of two or three, what's another?  I've been thinking and thinking hard about the way I act, and what life really is for me. I admit that I can get carried away sometimes and I will let my worries overflow...what else do you need to know? I am nowhere near perfect and I will make my mistakes. But to be a completely nice, personable character is hell--try it for a school day. You end up thinking about exactly what is going to come out of your mouth before it escapes, and you end up censoring so much negativity. Reciprocality in petty conversations is a must, and so I find myself enquiring what classes people are taking and how they are when they ask me too, even when I don't really care. I am terribly sorry if Tiff thinks living on the edge is ok, but I'm still sticking to my method of working hard until I get something solid.  So we return to Ayn Rand. We are not born to be second-handers but to rely on ourselves. We do not labor for others selflessly. Whether you like it or not, selfishness is an essential human instinct. Forget the negative connotation--what is the point of your life when you just spend it trying to make it better for others? Utopia only exists when a) you do whatever makes you happy when b) you do not bother anyone or c) make sure others are ok with your interference in their lives. And apparently, some people aren't ok with me. Honestly, public opinion is such crap, especially if I get in trouble for wanting to do well. Yes, sometimes I may take it too far. And at this point, as long as I haven't turned every soul against me I'm ok. Don't tell me that Tiffany has never been rude to me or whined to me. As for my supposed "arrogance" and "snobbishness" or something like that, I even forget the exact wording of the charge, I do not see how I cannot come to lament how I cannot meet my goals when other people can do so freely. So what if I want to get a higher SAT score?  In the end, this is an excellent case for introversion. If nobody wants to talk to me, then fine, I'll just write to myself. I honestly don't care to associate with people who think I'm just a stuck-up POS. And I'm not even doing it for arrogance's sake! I am just unsatisfied with my work. Ok, so maybe I complain verbally. OK, SO I'LL SHUT UP NOW SO YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PEACE AND COMPLAIN TO THE REST OF YOU ABOUT WHATEVER MEDIOCRITY PLAGES YOUR LIVES.  And the stupid thing is that I should have known from the first bullying instance that some people are just power whores and that true friends are harder to come across than you really think. It's gotten to the point where you just have to come to terms with the fact that if you really can't get along with these people, they aren't meant to be your friends and that you should just   stay away   even when it means self-imposed isolation.  Then again, now I feel like such a deprived loser. I imagine all the ugly rumors going around about me and my apparent "arrogance." I imagine that behind my back heads turn shielded by cold hands, mouths whispering criticisms. And frankly, it sucks. I apparently am not allowed to voice any complaint or frustration now, so I sit there like everything's fine when it isn't. I don't have anyone to confide in--all I can do is just cry to him, angry on the phone and decide somehow that it's his fault too and then hang up and resolve to never talk to him again. Sometimes I think that it's stupid, but then again why should I be the weak one? Do I really need another person in my life who just thinks critically of me? Do I need to plant more damning evidence by talking to him? Do I need to talk to someone who's traditionally sided with Tiffany when it comes to making fun of Lydia, and not just in this case? Do I need to talk to the person who knows almost every single one of my faults and has the evidence to prove it? Maybe this destructive pattern will be broken by some extraordinary spurt of kindness or even understanding, but from experience I don't see that happening. It's so sad though. Sometimes I think I'm done with being angry and that I can try to make things normal again, but then I question myself: who am I to think that I can just regulate the relationship between people? And in whatever way you look at it, I'm probably bothering him and we've already gone through the usual motions of not talking to each other, so what is the point? According to most, I am not nearly worthy, anyways. Rare is the person who still thinks of me as if there was nothing extremely wrong.  I am tired of being sad. The problem is that I have not a soul  to be happy with.
