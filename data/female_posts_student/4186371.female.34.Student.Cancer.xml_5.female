I've been waiting to take a shower since this morning when I let the water run for about 10 minutes before finally giving up because I had to go to work.  This whole incident has made me think of all the other things that peeve me off.   1) drivers who cut in front of you, seeming frantic to get into your lane because their turn off is coming up... and they don't turn off!     2) those buttheads talking on their cell phones while drivi  ng   3) tailgaters   Have you ever heard of that song "Only Stupid People Are Breeding"?  That song always comes to mind whenever I come across one of these incompetent drivers.  Sometimes I'll even sing a few bars.    4) those guys in muscle cars who thing they're God's gift to automechanics     5) people who are habitually late   (I'm talking longer than 30 minutes, anything before that is fine)   6) smokers     7) politicians who think mudslinging is the way to get me to vote.    I don't vote.  I've heard all the arguments on why I should vote.  But I'm not convinced.    It doesn't matter who you vote for because these politicians will say anything to get your vote and then renig on all of it when they're in office.  So what's the point?  The Republicans will always hate the Democrats and vice versa.   8) people who don't keep their laundry moving when I'm trying to wash a load        That's a few of my pet peeves.  I'm sure I'll think of others.   Well, I've got a couple options for getting a shower. a) go home - but then the entire endeavor, driving there, showering, driving back... in rush hour traffic, will take almost 2 hours. b) call the client's parents who don't live that far away and find out if the shower in the other bathroom works.  I was told there was a problem with pipes in that bathroom and that I should use the other one.  I actually did call them but I haven't heard back yet. c) find someone nearby who will take pity on me and my smelly self.  Okay, I don't smell. d) take a sponge bath of sorts with the bathroom sink (cold water) and wash my hair in the kitchen sink (the only faucet in the house with hot water) or e) suffer through it, go home on Friday and take a shower then (not exactly one of my favorite choices since I'd like to take a shower today)  So what do you readers think?  Which option should I go with? A, B, C, D, or E
