Hopefully now I will be able to update my website and add all my neato dc pictures...hahah.  Bets as to whether or not that will actually happen?  If tonight goes the way the rest of the weekend has gone, I'll probably just end up passed out on the couch, an unopened energy drink vulcan death gripped in my hands...Sigh.
