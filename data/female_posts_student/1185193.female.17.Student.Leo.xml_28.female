We have this thing--it is a little embarrassing--but we have a little dance to the song.  It is required that all Alias watchers in the room must perform the spastic actions.  There are different versions that everyone can do, but the movement is basically the same.  Whatever you do, you have to keep moving for those 27 seconds.  Everyone shakes their arms and legs up in the air and toggles their head.   Some remain on the furniture, while other more passionate members of the family get on their back on the floor and volitally wave their  arms, legs, and head.  When the music pauses at the end, everyone freezes in the position that they are in, and resume normal functioning when the comercial begins.  Every family does this, right?  And this is my own thing that I do.   I have the Alias soundtrack from season one.  When I listen to it in my car, I pretend that I am Sydney going on a mission.  I'm sure that that is quite normal too.   :)
