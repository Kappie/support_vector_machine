We were too busy talking and wasn't paying attention to where we were walking so then we finally made it to HeadWaters after a while and we hung out by the pond a little and I saw on the other side of the railing on the rocks and I heard something in the grass. Before I knew it, I was staring at a snake! It was moving in the grass and I was so scared I freaked out and tried to climb back over as quickly as possible. Then I wanted to see it again so I looked for it and found it in the grass. Haha... it slithered away though. So cool~ ^^ We walked around some more and guess who we saw... Ms. Rodway. Two people were walking towards us in the distance and I was like "Is that Rodway?" cos I recognized the jacket and it was. Her and her husband out for a walk. So weird... she described him as handsome and her husband... well, let's just say he's definitely umm... blah. You know what I mean right? I wouldn't use the word "handsome" but then again... its her husband. Of course she thinks hes handsome. :) I love Nima and I think he's the sexiest guy on earth although other girls may not think so. So blah. So Kryss and I walked to the community centre and bought something to eat, ate outside watching tennis, talked, bought something to drink, ate, talked. Etc~! Found out we lived in the same neighborhood when we were little! Hehe! So cool! We also talked about Nima and high school... *sniff sniffzZ* So scared, still.   Then Krystal came over to my house to see the grad dress and then I went to her house and checked out her grad dress. So pretty! ^^ Silver halter~! Coolness! She's gonna look so pretty and GIRLY! Hehe! Nima called while we were hanging out in the kitchen and we talked on the phone for a while. I missed him so much. I could've ran over to his house just to give him a hug. :(  So yeah... I'm home again. He said he'd call in a while so whenever that is... lol. He also said that for some reason, he missed me the most last night... strangely, that was the same for me... So weird. ^^  We went by a "Father's Day Sale" and I bought a keychain-ish thing that you can tie to your phone for Nima. I have one and I got one for him. Mine is Cancer and Nima is Virgo. Kryss got one too! She's a Gemini! Hehe! Cuteness.
