Another deep and meaningful thing, but sad. Hmm... I could go into all this stuff about why I do stuff but that's just down right depressing! When I was younger I thought that it was me versus the world because of... stuff so I guess that's why I was all quiet and must do good in school when I was younger, I guess that's why I can't be bothered some times, to look good for other people but I still care. *breathes* Deep and meaningful enough? Mmm... maybe. Geez, I'm gonna go all spiritual now, aargh this spiritual music that my brother has downloaded just annoys me. Aww, isn't it tight, today was my dad's 'day off' but he went into work any way! They work him too hard! I'm gonna go kill people on FFX even though I died! (sob sob) Must... kill... Seymour! (Or however you spell it) Ok... time to go, seriously, before the cats try and eat me cause I haven't fed them bubi!
