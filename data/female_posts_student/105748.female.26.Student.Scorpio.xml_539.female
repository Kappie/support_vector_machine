Here's the haul:   VHS  The Producers  The Seven-Year Itch  The Princess Bride  DVD  It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World  CD  Chick Corea and Return To Forever - Light As A Feather  Santana - Welcome  Santana - Festival  Medeski, Martin, and Wood - Combustication  Boz Scaggs - Boz Scaggs  Mountain - Greatest Hits  Except for Princess Bride and MM, these are all 70's or earlier.  Not all have stood the test of time - Festival is not nearly as good as I remember, nor is the Mountain CD (which replaces two LPs, "Climbing" and "Nantucket Sleighride" that were swiped when I was in HIGH SCHOOL).  However, "Welcome" is still brilliant, so is "Light As A Feather".  Both are Latin flavored pop jazz at its' finest (take THAT, Supreme Beings of Leisure!)  And Boz's best album is still his first - from back when they knew how to make a song interesting for 12 minutes.  I'll review the movies after we watch 'em.  Daf
