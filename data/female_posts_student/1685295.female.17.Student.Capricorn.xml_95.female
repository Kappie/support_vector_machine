Deciding to post on here came with some massive moral conflicts. Firstly b/c I am against Blog and Xanga and the like. Then again I wouldn't mind an opportunity to try to piss people off or forecfully impose my beliefs on others...to each his own. But seriously, if I kept trashing Blog and the like, I'd look real pompous, and I didn't want anyone to think that I think I'm better than them because I don't post.  That's a lie, I just said that to make you feel better.  Well look forward to being offended or filled with unnhealthy amounts of emptiness, hope I said SOMETHING funny...  I'm Deadinside and that's my rant for today  "I look forward to when we meet again" "Better watch out, you're headed straight for a wall"
