Not that you don't have a choice, you do... similarly he does have a choice as well... you guys are juz sweeping things under the carpet and living in oblivion, paradoxically, hoping that things will smoothen out by itself eventually.. but such things don't happen...   I'm not in position to advise you on what you shld do and moreso to help you to decide...ultimately, this is your relationship with him.. I feel that everyone muz bear the consequences for their actions.. you do know what the results are for being in this relationship and somehow one of you muz make the sacrifice to bear the consequences... you can't untie the knot unless you loosen a piece of the string... This will go no-where as he doesn't want to chose, he's too soft... seeking the easy escape route.. I know you told me abt the mother and friends but come on, they shld respect what he wants.. and upon saying this, I want to let you know I respect your decision as well.. so much as I dislike it...   Now, it is the time for you to think it through and perhaps toss it out with him rather than pondering and questioning... if he can't take it then that's juz too bad..coz a relationship is not a mind-game.. it's not abt scheming... it's not abt shutting the other party up... it's really abt openess and transparency with each other... lies after lies...empty promises after empty promises won't bring you far... it can even be detrimental to your future with him as you guys have started out with mistrust... and disappointments... so Jac, do yourself a favour make the decision... you can't wait for him..   Sad to say for women, our youth is fading away quickly we are no longer the sort-after-books in the library, we are fast becoming left on the shelves... the other day, Nick (my other boss)said that women who want to achieve everything in life will miss the boat and that'll be too late... there's truth in his words... I don't want you to miss out on the boat that is destined to treat you well for life.. I want to be at your wedding in future, to see you in a wedding dress... I will be smiling for you...   Take care gal and treat yourself better...
