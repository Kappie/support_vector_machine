Actually, I am having a doughnut break, which is not officially included in my "I'm going to eat seven fruits and vegetables a day" plan, but it does have cinnamon on it, which is from a plant, soooo...  Yesterday when I got home from work (at the ungodly hour of 7:30pm), I opened the garage door and poor Rico came streaking in the house.  Rico is my cat, in case anyone thinks I keep a naked yard boy in the garage during the day.  He was sweaty, if cats can get that way; I'm assuming from the humidity in the garage.  God knows how long the poor thing was in there; he looked 3 pounds lighter than his normal 12 pound self.  I tried really hard to show him how sorry I was that he had been stuck in the garage, even though I'm pretty sure I had nothing to do with it, but he insisted on antagonizing me the rest of the night.  See, Rico is a bipolar schizophrenic.  I know that's an odd diagnosis for a cat, but I'm certain of it.  He is 10 months old, enormous, and very pretty.  Which is good, because his personality leaves much to be desired.  Some days he will be waiting for me when I wake up, like a puppy, and rub against my legs while I get ready for work.  These days he'll let me pick him up, purr, and generally act like a normal cat.  Other days, I will pick him up and he immediately growls, cries, and acts as though I've tried to scalp him.  He runs away if I get near him and bites--very hard--if I try to pet him.  Some days, he'll do half and half:  when I wake up, he's sitting outside of my door to greet me and immediately begins purring.  I'll pick him up, scratch his head for a minute, and then he'll look at me with an expression of pure hate, bite me, and run away.  Can veterinarians prescribe lithium?  In other news, I have yet another out of town wedding to attend this weekend.  This will be my third in five weeks.  Talk about having the feeling of "always a bridesmaid" drilled into your head.  Except I'm not in the wedding party, so maybe it should be "always a reception guest" syndrome.  Which, when you think about it, isn't all bad.  I get to dress up, eat wedding cake, and drink prodigiously for free.  I just wish people would get married closer to my house.  Also on my agenda for this weekend is trading passive-aggressive barbs with my dad, always an entertaining evening.  I skipped Father's Day out of rebelliousness and immediately felt like a horrible person, so I called Monday and offered to take him out to dinner this weekend.  We will spend a few hours discussing why I have not yet accomplished anything worth talking about, all of the vacations that my stepmother and he are going to take other family members on, and the personal and professional achievements of all of my cousins.  At some point in the conversation I will be compared to my mother, which is a compliment in my mind and not one in his.  I will do my best to get in a few guilt-inspiring comments, possibly regarding his lack of appreciation for what I have managed to do with my life so far, and if I'm really feeling frisky I will mention how much I need a vacation, just so I can see how he avoids asking me to go on one with them.  And of course, if he does offer I'll decline, just to make things more complicated.  I'll give him his Father's Day gift, of which I'm actually very proud.  I smuggled a few Cuban cigars home the last time I was in Mexico, and I figured he could use a couple.  Nothing says love like illegal goods from Latin America.  Then we'll part ways, say how much we love and miss each other, and I'll go drink until I forget the whole encounter.    I know why my cat is crazy.  He inherited it from me.
