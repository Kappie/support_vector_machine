My group (Janet, Theo, me) spent the entire day talking about random drivel. Not kidding, apparently twinkies may survive the apocalypse... Anyway, it counts for a huge part of our grades so I have to spend all my tutorial time on Wednesday and Thursday working on it. Great, I was looking forward to going home early. Oh well, the project itself isn't that hard, our group just doesn't work well.
