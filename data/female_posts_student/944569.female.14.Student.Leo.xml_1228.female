Her face looked like a battlefield of acne.  Each zit, each pimple that was on her face was highlighted burning red.  I was standing next to Laura when Leah sort of sashayed her way over.  I could smell her stinking breath from where I was standing.  It was so terrifying.  I think that was the first time that I've ever seen someone drunk.  Her voice was all crackly and she was talking really loudly and declaring she was drunk in front of a ring of oblivious teachers.  I almost pissed my pants (well, dress.  lol, michelle).  Never, ever drink to excess.  It plays with your mind and leaves you with the title of the ass of the asses (I mean it in the donkey way).
