'specially when you keep getting texts from people who aren't there. haha we had to split up when we got there cuz there weren't enough seats together. so jen sat with jon, britt and noah sat together and that left me and julissa so we were sitting together and i'm pretty sure we had most of the people around us convinced we were on a date. then i almost wrecked my brother's car..that would have been a sad day in tellatubby land. yesterday me and britt went to see jen at work...lol then we sat at courtney's house talking to her mom for a couple hours. i got a text from aaron while we were there asking ifme,jen,britt, and courtwanted to come over and watch a movie with him and chris. but jen was at work and court was with her grandparents. me and britt were gonna go by but we lost track of time and when i realized what time it was i was suppose to have been home 10 minutes before. then i talked to chris and he told me how him and aaron had sat outside burning things waiting for us to get there. so i felt kinda bad.but atleast aaron's talking to me again.
