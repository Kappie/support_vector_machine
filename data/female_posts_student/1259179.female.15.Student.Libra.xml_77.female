Mel Gibson did good with this and He is in the movie.  He hold the nail because he says   He died because of me for me so I feel that it is important to do it  .  As most of you know, I became a Christian 4 years ago.  I never knew that I could have a relationship with God.  He has Blessed me in lots of way and sometimes I forget.  But watching this touching and moving story, refreshed and re-confirmes my faith.  The emotions that His Mother must of went thru was so well depicted, it tore us up.  Mom came with me to see and both her and I came out of there shaken.  It is incredible that a movie about a book that had been around forever, would make such an impact with ALL religious groups.  IT LOOKS LIKE A REVIVAL....  And I am ready.  On this Sunday morning, off to church so ............Be Good and God Bless \o/
