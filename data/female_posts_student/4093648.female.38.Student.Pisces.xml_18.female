I stand there with my neighbors sorting mail and throwing away crap that was cluttering up our boxes. If I didn't subscribe to magazines I would throw away everything but my utility bill. I used to look forward to the mail coming. It was exciting to see what might be there. But most people don't write letters anymore. Or even send cards. E-mail is great but there's something special about finding a letter in the mailbox.
