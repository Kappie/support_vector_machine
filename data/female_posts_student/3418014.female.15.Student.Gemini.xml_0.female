So far I have figured out that, on a blog, you apparentaly you have a template and then you post things. I think it asked me what I wanted my URL to be, so now I gues I have somesort of a site name to type in if I want to go to be blog. I've heard the term blogring before, is that what this is? Do I go to the same site to view and to post? How do I change my template?
