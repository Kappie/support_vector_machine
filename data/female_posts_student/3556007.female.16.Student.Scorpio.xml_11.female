The problem is that guys around here first looks at looks, then consider your personality. Because Ellen is Asian, many guys won't even consider going out with her. And... as a result of that, she has not even tried to be appealing to guys (except for the other day when she wore nice pants, nice shoes, and a pretty shirt). You can tell that she really wants a guy just because of the way that she talks. She sees Emily (who isn't that pretty) talking about how she went to homecoming and how she made out with this guy and that guy, and Ellen feels jealous. Before, when we were watching Armagaddon, and there is this one scene where Brad Pitt and Liv Tyler are just having a picnic. They are being super sweet and everything, and Ellen was like "Too bad that is never going to happen to me." She is maturing liek all of us, but the thing is that there aren't any guys interested in us. Now, when I am finally getting involved with guys, Ellen is getting jealous of it. She says I spend more time with Hunter than I do with her. The thing is that I am attracted to him, and I really can't do anything about it. What I hate is how she acts like her life is such a hell-hole. She complains about the future and everything when she has a hell of a better life than me. She has a job that she enjoys and makes plenty of money with, her parents are going to buy her a car and pay for the insurance, she is dilligent and studious, and she gets good grades. So, basically, she sees me getting the guys and is pissed off b/c of jealousy. She is also so mean about Matt and Kevin.
