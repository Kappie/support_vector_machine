I got tons of clothes which I was totally thrilled about, naturally.  Also got a portable DVD player, which, oddly enough, I am using all the time and love it so much!  Other random stuff... DVD’s, purses, a wallet, etc.  All in all, a success.  Everybody that I got a gift for liked it, so I was happy about that.  Charles got me the coolest present- Paul Frank pajama pants (soooo cute and comfy!) and a “Jesus is my homeboy” t-shirt.  Awesome!!!  I can’t wait to go get a pink “Mary is my homegirl” shirt to complete the set.  hehe  Went to Medieval Times with Charles and his mom this past Sunday.  I had only been one other time in 6th grade (maybe? sometime in middle school, at least.) and it was a lot of fun.  We saw Nick Morgan working there and he hooked us up with tickets to the Torture Chamber (oooooo... scary!  Actually, I felt sick to my stomach afterwards... pretty gruesome stuff) and a fake rose with a light inside so it glows when you turn it on!  Very cool.  I have daily lesson thingies with Mr. Pace this week for Area tryouts.... it SUCKS!  Not only do I have to wake up early, but I have to go to the band hall over my Christmas break, and play and suck it up because I haven’t played in so long.  Oh well.  It’s actually made me practice and I’m feeling much more confident and playing everything much better than I was before Christmas break.  So that’s a plus.  I’m still trying not to get my hopes up about making state though... I’m afraid of being let down if I don’t make it (which is a very huge and likely possibility).  Mr. Pace is actually not as bad as I thought he’d be.  He’s very complimentary and has even given me some good practice ideas.  Although I don’t agree with everything he says, he has some insights that I hadn’t thought of before.  Yesterday, after practicing at the band hall in the morning, Charles, Bob, and I went to the Local Diner to get some lunch.  Then we took Bob home and Charles and I went rollerblading at Andy Brown East.  So much fun!  Charles fell three times and I didn’t fall once (but we won’t say anything about that, now will we, Charles *wink wink*)  hehe... nm... Anyways, then we went to his house for a little while, then my house.  We sat around, bored as could be, and then he went home to eat dinner.  He came back later and then David and Shelly came over and we played Taboo.  Then Charles started feeling really sick : (  David and Shelly left to go to Starbucks and shortly afterwards, Charles went home because he was feeling so awful.  And sure enough, he threw up last night and is really sick today, so get better Charles!!!!    I didn’t do much today since Charles was sick.  I actually resorted to doing homework, and I practiced for a while.  Watched some TV (Trading Spaces, While You Were Out, Clean Sweep- yay for redecorating shows on TLC!!!).  Collin gets home tomorrow (YAYYYYY!!!!!!!!) and then a rockin New Years Eve party at Ross’s!  So, hopefully tomorrow will be better than today, assuming Charles gets all better. *fingers crossed*  Not really anything else to say.  I hope everyone is having a relaxing and enjoyable Christmas break.  Sadly, there’s only 5 days left... Oh well, I’ll try not to think about it!  Cool song alert!  Coldplay – “Shiver”  Bye bye everyone!
