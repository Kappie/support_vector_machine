Hehe... be funny if we actually hated each other all that time! Don't worry Izzy! I still love you! *in a non bi/tri way!!! *someone kissed Izzy and said that they're bi* Err... not that I'm trying to spread malicious rumours about Izzy or something!

Read 1984 and you'll understand how scary! (It could be 1982... I'm never sure!) Or go watch Gravitation and go 'hmm' until you get to the 2nd one! Err... yeah dammit I control your life!!! *now THAT would be scary! Trust me, it would. I'ld probably have you eating peanut butter with cheese! *mmm* I... have to... go now... *mmm peanut butter and cheese* to do homework and play the piano! (Pfft. Yeah right!)
