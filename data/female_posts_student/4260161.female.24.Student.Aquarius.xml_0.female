That explains why I haven't done my assignments even though school starts in 4 days. Nice, huh?       My mom consistently warned me that it was a bad habit. A very bad trend to start in elementary school that would certainly catch up with me in middle school. Well, it continuted in middle school and the warnings increased: 'this has to stop before high school.' You cannot start writing a paper the night before it's due. Yet the whole time I was bringing in A's she couldn't complain tooooo much. "It will definitely ruin you in college. College kids don't do that." Personally, I don't think it was the proscratination that caused my A average to drop. I think it was the FUN. and the beer. But anyway, I still procrastinate because I work better under pressure. It's hard for me to concentrate on something that isn't due for another week. If I read it now, by next Thursday I'll have forgotten the details.    My little sister is currently at day #1 of orientation at another law school in the south. Hers is ranked higher than mine, if you're wondering. But I had more fun in college. Her graduation present consisted of all my first year supplemental materials wrapped up in pretty pink paper. She was impressed by the number of presents until she started opening them. haha.
