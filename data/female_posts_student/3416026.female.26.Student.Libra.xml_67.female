At any rate(ahem) I tried to pick a husband.  I kind of liked how  urlLink Shyan Narayan  seemed kinda laid back.  Judging by his picture, he likes especially to ride escalators, and as for musical tastes he reports that he is into "melodies and heavy beats."  Cool!  On the other hand, the efficiency of  urlLink Krishna Mohan's  profile was interesting.   For instance, his likes and dislikes:   - I am not interested in sports. I like Adventure sports.  - I do not like to read business  sports pages in news paper.  - I am not interested in local politics but I am very much interested in international politics, wars.  - I do not like Pets in the living room. I have no pets. But i have no objection if there is lot of space around the house. and of course no caged birds or chained animals.  - I do not like onion/garlic and many other spices but I can tolerate, not a big problem. I like more of a Jain Diet.  - I prefer to go to exclusive Vegetarian restaruants, but some times it becomes unavoidable while on tour.  - I like old songs and Ghazals.  - I lost interest in Cricket 10 years ago.   Now, wouldn't you like to meet up for a nice strict vegetarian meal and find out about the great cricket scandal of '94 which caused him to lose interest?  Also, in case you were thinking he's one of those typical guys who sits around and only reads the business and sports pages, you're wrong!  What DOES Krishna read?  The unanswered questions are so tantalizing.  And for the dudes,  urlLink Kausika  is a little firecracker, is she not?   There's lots of other good stuff here, like the  urlLink "What to get your man" gift recommendation list .  You can bet your boots that my dad will be receiving an Indoor / outdoor weather station for recommending this site to me.  In all seriousness, though: I know arranged marriages probably work for lots of people.  And there's hardly anything weirder about this than there is about online dating sites.  It's not that. I guess it's just that it's so high-stakes.  For the 2.5 minutes that I actually pretending I was picking out a husband, I felt sick to my stomach.  The relationship of the information here to the life you create with someone is just either way too over- or underwhelming, I'm not sure which.  No pets in the living room.  No onions.  Fun-loving. Adventure sports.  Holy shit.  No thanks.  [PS-  I decide that I like Shyan.  Krishna's haircut is too no-nonsense. I am afraid it would yell at me or call me lazy or something.]
