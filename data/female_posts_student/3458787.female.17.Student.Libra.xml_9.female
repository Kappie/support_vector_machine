It has already been almost 2 years since I left Cedar(my secondary school) I would classify the 4 years I spent there as the most wonderful, eventful and closest to my heart.. TOTALLY enjoyed myself there to the maximum :)  The work load there was not large. Studies went very smoothly and best of all I enjoyed every single thing I did there-  from class activities to Tamil class activities to prefectorial board stuff.  Tamil class was the best there hahaha never thought that I would actually say Tamil class was nice..hahah but truthfully I did enjoy it! Actually it was not the learning part (not at all the learning part actually). It was in fact the people and the teacher. It was a time to relax, chat (a lot.. Always used to get scolded! Me and my really really good friend- you know who you are- of mine used to sit next to each other and talk about everything in the world except about the stuff happening in class *guilty guilty* We were always in our own world..haha to make things better we used to sit in one far end of the class :)  ) I will always remember the times when we and the teacher used to just simply talk totally un-Tamil related stuff.. about my teacher's family, stuff happening in school etc etc.. mind you, we had our ways to divert my teacher away from official class discussions :) Then there were the times we got some of my friends to sing for us in the name of practicing for competitions hehehe (they are really good singers).   Then there was the prefectorial board.. had all those fun and hysterical cleaning the prefects' room session and the trashing the juniors sessions..LOL we were quite mean at times to our juniors I guess (hahah if anyone of you are reading this..I'm really sorry hahaha). Loved the late nights spent in school esp. all those camps..we spooked ourselves with the many ghost stories about school (the clock tower, the toilets, the old building etc..hahah you will understand why when you see where my school is situated- its right next to a cemetery).  The 4 years spent in Cedar went by in a flash. Soon it was time to give my valedictorian speech. Everyone continued on with their separate lives in different directions. Many of my friends went overseas while others went to different colleges. But of cause there some who came along with me to NJ to start yet another chapter of our exciting lives...
