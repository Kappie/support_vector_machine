It was a weird convo, but we won't go there.. Yet again let me express how much I miss Mat..I don't know if I'm gunna hold up until sunday, bc right now that seems soooooooooooooo far away! But, this trip has made me realise how much he really does mean to me, so i guess it hasnt been all that bad.. but i wish i could be there with him. when i talked to him yesterday I could hear in his voice how much he really missed me. It was soooo sweet,but i hate hearin him like that.
