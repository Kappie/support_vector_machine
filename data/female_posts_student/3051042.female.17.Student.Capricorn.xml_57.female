Terrible customer issues.  Evening: Got out of work. Went to Michelle's and we went out to South University to play DDR and get Starbucks. Talked with her co-worker Steve(?) for a few. Headed home after playing some pool. DDR kicked my ass tonight. lol. I can't believe I'm writing about DDR.   Night: I dropped Michelle off at home. Then headed back here. Josh called and we talked for a few before Reanda showed up. He told me that I have this way of turning a man mentally ill after dating them. I called Allen. Yes, you read that right. I called Allen. He's doing alright. Damn, I miss him. Did I just type that? Well... I do... He said I should join the Robotics team in the fall again. I'm considering.  I need to get homework finished. I've slacked off enough for this semester. I'm going to a full day of school tomorrow, but participating in Senior Skip Day on Friday. Mother / Daughter shopping extravaganza on Friday afternoon. Ah.. well off to homework and sleep.
