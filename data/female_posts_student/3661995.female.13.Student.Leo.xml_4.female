I don't want the holidays to end. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!      Aargh, she's asking me to get off the computer again. Really, Eva, you can be soooo not understanding. I just completed my History homework, why can't I just write or enjoy myself for a while... you can use the other computer...that doesn't have internet! (laughs) I'm being mean again...      Seems like today's post will be this short, since I have to let her use the computer... aargh, she's calling mom. Evalyn!!! Grr! I'll get you!
