Anyways, my last days were so so but I have been listening to alot of music lately :P  Make me wanna dance ~^.^~  haha ~  Also, I have been thinking of my birthday.. and I was told that my birthday wish would come true for certain. I guess I will just have to wait untill I blow the candles out *crosses fingers for the wish*  I really think it would be hard to grant my wish.. I mean it would take that person some thinking and me too.. whatever > Well gotta go to my room and do some thinking..
