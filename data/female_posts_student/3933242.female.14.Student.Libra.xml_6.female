I had noticed that i have a wonderfully inspirating ,brave parents who stood with the family alll this while.. i had notices this when this major problem (so sorry.. confidentual)  pop up of my life... i never had expect this problem to arise... hope this wil get betta each day... i hope very much... but, however, through this , i learnt to learn many kinda things i have yet to discover when i am still in my happy days of life... maybe this is a blessing in disguise... i   must not give up   no matter what... i must achieve something to make my parents happy.. and i will.... i hope... i mean i must....(can'T be discouraged at this point of time)..
