Instead of doing it yesterday, right after work, just like I planned, I went to Starbucks and wrote for three hours. Now I'm not saying it was bad for me to write cause it wasn't. I need to get back in that schedule and I'm happy that I've forced myself in to it. But I really need to drop off that application or everything goes to hell in a handbasket. Le sigh. I, also, now have a crush. However, it is a secret and this is the internet so the name shall never be written here. Just be happy for me that I have a crush, ok? Ok. Iknow I'm in the minority here, but I love having crushes on people who I knowwill never like me in return. I'm not saying I'm some deformed monstrosity, just the facts. I don't stress about if they like me back, or if I'm flirting too hard, or if I'm blushing too much. It's allfun. I can relax around them and have no expectations whatsoever. Of course, I wouldn't mind if they liked me back but I'm not going to think on that. Why don't I ask them out, you ask? For the simple reason that I'mscared and I don't like rejection. Ha! Weren't expecting an honest answer were you? Showed you, I did.   In other news, I'm still looking for a picture phone. All the ones theCingular store by my work had were ass. I need to take photos! Anthony found his oldcamera and it got me itching to start taking photos again. I used to, back in the day. Back when I had enough creative energy to rival Michelangelo. Ok, maybe not him....but I was a little artistic genius. So in addition to the camera phone I will be purchasing an actualcamera. Not apoint and shoot one.....a real one. One that takes a certain amount of skill to operate.I'm very excited and am browsing for one today.   Time for the work.
