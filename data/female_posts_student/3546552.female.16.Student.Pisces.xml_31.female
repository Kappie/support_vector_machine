This morning I mowed the lawn, did my nails, got some more RSVP's for my party, got hooked up with a v-ball net so we can have even more fun tomorrow! YeeHaw, this is gonna be great, I just wish that you could be there the whole time. So yeah, then this afternoon I spent time running some more virus checks on my computer and then I tried to install  AIM  to get rid of the virus and well, you already know this, so yeah, it was a boring day with nothing truly exciting...I just can't stop thinking about tomorrow! I'm so excited...so now I'm off to make a bookmark from my flowers(random I know...)! I can't figure out what to write on it though...hmmm... any suggestions? ~BS  *Each time we have a quarrel it almost breaks my heart, cause I am so afraid that we will have to part. Each night I ask the stars up above ...   why must I be a teenager in love?   One day I feel so happy, next day I feel so sad. I guess I'll learn to take the good with the bad. Each night I ask the stars up above...   why must I be a teenager in love?   I cried a tear for nobody but you. I'll be a lonely one if you should say we're through. Well if you want to make me cry, that won't be so hard to do. If you should say goodbye, I'll still go on loving you. Each night I ask the stars up above ...   why must I be a teenager in love?    ~Dion and the Belmonts  ~haha good song, so cute...yes  cute ...and nice harmonies, I love oldies!
