Instead, what I have to show for my efforts is a profile consisting of a photo that makes me look both about 80lbs overweight (which I am) and evil (which I am not....I don't think) and a selection of "interests" that are, let's be honest, a bit iffy at best. (Example: what movies do I like? Hmmm. Wonder what's in the video player. Nope, not putting that. The DVD player? Star Trek. A definite improvement but not actually mine. Getting nowhere fast. Let me think....what other half-decent films have I seen in the last six months? Oh, sod it, that'll have to do.)   I have therefore decided to abandon Blog for the rest of the evening in favour of some undemanding TV, and will have another go tomorrow.
