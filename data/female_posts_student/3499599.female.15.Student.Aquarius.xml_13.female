As soon as I finished checking somethings online here at home, I said to my Mom, "Ok..I'm ready to go back to camp now."  I'm very happy because..camp was a lot of fun. And I made some new friends! Yay for me! But..I'm just so sad because I love that place. It's really hard for me to explain. I always love going there and it just makes me so happy and..bleh..I'm rambling on.   So. A few things that happened..  -Went and saw The Chronicles of Riddick (good movie, but made little sense since we missed the first fifteen minutes)  -Made friends with my counselor after first asking her if she got her shirt from Roots (It was a shirt with just the word "Canada" on it..kind of like the one I have)..and from there, we just had a lot of interesting conversations. Lets see..I found out that her parents are from Romania, which was great, because I got her to teach me a few new phrases..and told her some that I know that I've learned from my own family. And then Brenda (Brenda Schultz McCarthy..it's her camp =p) told us how Karine (that's her name) dated Andy Roddick before he made it big which..that was really interesting.   -Made friends with a guy named C.J. from DC who..just reminded me of a lot of people. Part of him reminded me of my stand partner in symphony, in personality and the same age thing. Part of him reminded me of my best friend, Aaron (which was a good thing)..but then  another  part of him reminded me of my neighbor, Cole, which is not necessarily a good thing. He was fun to talk to, though. I needed someone like that. Otherwise I would've gone insane from listening to the girls in my cabin talking about what they were going to wear each day and..oy. And he had the same PS2 games as me ^_^ Lotsa common interests, which was fun. Yay.   -I got a lot more..tan. yeah. Whoopee.  -My tan lines are now a whole lot worse. yeah. Whoopee.  -Had a lot of fun ^_^  Can't think of anything else to write about. I just..miss camp now. Maybe going to journalism camp on Monday..or whenever I go..that'll hopefully get my mind off of tennis camp. hm.   Song for today: I Won't Spend Another Night Alone by The Ataris (I love The Ataris..and the band No Use For a Name..they're my favorites XD)
