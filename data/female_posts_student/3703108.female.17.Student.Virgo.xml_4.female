I'm so happy...Katie just told me that Evan is coming and he's bringing Joanne! I really want him to like her because he's struggling with his sexuality. He really needs to get back on track with God before he gets involved in any relationship, but at least Joanne is a girl and she'll keep him away from Sean. Sean is Evan's boyfriend. Well, not anymore. About a week ago, Joanne called Evan and told him that she's in love with him and Sean found out and broke up with Evan because of it. The next day he said he didn't mean any of it, but Evan said it's over and he doesn't want to get back together with him. I'm proud of Evan for doing the right thing. I think he should go for Joanne. She's really pretty and really nice. Even if she's not the best girl for him...She's a girl. Anyway, I can't wait to see Evan today! I miss him so much. I haven't seen him since graduation. I have nothing to wear to the party today. I think I wanna go shopping. I don't know. I'll see what happens. I'm gonna go eat breakfast now. See ya sucker!
