But yesterday my cousins were there, and my uncle and his wife and their new St. Bernard. Eep! :) It was nice to see my cousins again...it had been almost a year since I had seen them last. They are both the cutest red headed girls in the universe and they are as different as night and day and still as close as two peas in a pod. I showed them how to take pictures and use a camera. It was fun. The older one of the two really seemed interested...but I swear she seems interested in anything I say...Shes my one person fan club! She laughs at any joke I crack...even if it wasnt a joke. What can I say? She gets the giggles. After spending some time out at the farm we went to dinner and then everyone by my hubby and I proceeded to go to the movies to see Shrek II. While it was a good flick...we didnt feel like going again quite so soon...so we bailed. But I warned my older cousin ahead of time (she cries sometimes when saying goodbye) that I would be seeing her in a month (July 4th weekend) and she shouldnt be concerned that we arent going to the movie. Whew. No tears. Thank goodness. She gets in trouble for things like that.  I got some great pictures of my mom's Aussie Cattle Dog and the St. Bernard Playing...and some really cute snaps of my cousins too.  We came home from our adventure and awaited the arrival of my husband sister, her hubby, and their beagle Maggie. Let the games begin. Henry and Maggie sniffed and meowed/whined at each other through the basement door but the in-law parents are determined that "ne'er the twain shall meet." So much for what they know about animals. The sister in-la,w which I guess I should pseudonym "Crafty" and her hubby "Reds", (they are from Cinci...and the husbands favorite sport/team/lifetime event is baseball and hes a Reds fanatic...although I think he will watch anything on ESPN just because its ESPN...) Well they are both nice people. Reds makes me laugh and we get along pretty well on most things. He is a teacher and has alot of interest and respect for kids...reads Lemony Snickett and whatnot...I figure anyone who reads Lemony Snickett cant be that bad! Crafty is smart and sweet and shes only 2 years older than me...but she works really hard to belong to a different world...The world of candle parties, scrap booking parties, Longaberger baskets, and quilting. These are the passtimes of so many women...and I am not sure why. An excuse to socialize? Trying to fullfill their concept of feminimity? I just dont get it. I have NO interest in any of those things...just a way to waste money to me. Candles = Cat Tail Burners. Yankee candles may be the poo but I just could care less. Longaberger baskets are the biggest gyp ever. Hello! $300 for woven scraps of wood???!?!?!?! Scrap booking was cool when it was personal and not mass produced/marketted. Now its become a Martha Stewart passtime. Quilting. Now that is something I think is kinda cool and wish I could do. I like artistic and classic quilts. They remind me of...my grandma, a time with different complications, a clean bed in a big house, and sleeping tight on a summer or winter night. Quilts kind of make me reminisce a bit. But if I made them...they would not be cheezy patterns, idyllic scenes, or antinquated country stylings. They would be true to their original idea of scraps, or abstract artistic experiements in cloth. Not kitchy "wedding quilt" silliness.  Right so have I gotten off topic or what?  I had a dream last night about picking out a dog. It was from a terrible place...something like Oliver Twist for dogs. It was a Wheaton Terrier and I recognized it from a breeder's website..which was quite nice...and not at all like Oliver Twist. I wanted to take all the dogs out of the terrible place in my dream...but I couldnt...I tried to take two...I was having a moral/ethical quadary about how to decide which dogs to take when I was awoken by the sniffing muzzle of Maggie the Beagle. :) What a better ending.  I have found that after being here for one month...I dont really care for Luke's mom much. She will complain just for the hell of it. If someone makes a simple suggestion to alleviate the issue for which she is complaining...she will ignore it. She wants to complain about the kitchen floor getting scuffy, being hot, having car troubles...I guess complaining gets her attention. But look at me now...complaining about her complaining. Ug. I try to talk to her...you know about stuff shes interested in, about stuff we are doing, about our plans and what not. Whatever it is I say she gives me cautionary warnings..."Dont come to me when you get in trouble." "It's a different generation..." "You kids do things differently..." Mind you in each of these scenarios different means bad. I dont think it occurs to her that even if we could/tried/wanted to do things the way SHE did them when she was our age...WE CANT. The world has changed...not just the generations. She says things like "We dont cook from boxes or cans" as if its a badge of honor instead of a stubborn attitude of persevering in inconvenience. Well I can rant in my blog pretty safely...and keep my tongue while I am here in her house...Most people dont lead the charmed life of being a housewife to an engineer. She talks about saving money and not spending it and whatnot...and buys $200 vitamins...what a waste considering there is no research backing that expensive vitamins absorb incredibly better than standard ones do. She doesnt want the facts about the vitamins...I didnt want her to be getting ripped off....but she wont look at the facts...the studies...the research. She forms her opinions on thin air. Without the need of fact. That is true opinion forming...the process she undergoes requires no critical thinking whatsoever.  Gah...and now my cat is sitting in front of my keyboard. I think he wants attention *dodges cat tail under nose*   Well now just so Im not seeming bitchy without balance...when we went to visit my mom she gave us an anniverssary gift (2 years since the day at the church) and it was quite generous. $200. I know they are in a money crunch (believe me I asked for help buying my run around car...and she told me what their financial situation is...they are putting up cider works) so I appreciate their generosity a lot. Well, lets just say I am thankful. Grateful.  I am also thankful and grateful to the generosity and kindness that allows us to have a free home, free food, and safe living everyday under the roof of my in-laws. They are more considerate than many I know for giving us a hand. I am not sure whether it was because they felt they couldnt say no...or what...but regardless they are permitting us to share their space...and no matter what nerve they jump up and down on...I will be thankful for their sharing of their home.  And with that Sunday is born. A day of thanks. Weekly thanksgiving...a day of prayer for many. A day of introspection as well. For me, its the longest day of the week. Dragging on like roadkill on a bumper. Maybe thats too gruesome...more like dragging on like a bad movie when you have to pee. Yeah. Thats more like a Sunday.   Well thats all the news in fits of print. --Mack
