At best it seems that Willard has a sort of respect for Kurtz's character, however there is no moral judgment in regard to his actions. When Chef is freaking out about the evil he is surrounded by and how insane Kurtz is Willard offers no comment, he just tells Chef what to do to help him destroy it. Willard does not respond to Chef by praising Kurtz either. Ultimately Willard never gives any sign of judgment, good or bad. In this regard Kurtz is portrayed not as immoral, but rather as amoral, as free from moral restraints, somehow beyond them. He cannot be judged because he is one of the soldiers he talks about,he acts without judgment.
