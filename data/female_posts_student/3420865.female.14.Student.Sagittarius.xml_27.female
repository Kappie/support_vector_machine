(please see above.)  3.  say "yep", "yup", "yepper", or anything else that sounds overly perky.  4.  judge people they don't even know.  5.  move on from friend to friend so quickly.  6.  think they know what's best for you.  7.  think they know everything about your life.  8.  try to be something they're quite obviously  not .  9.  talk about themselves all the time, and when they do ask about you, the conversation is quickly overted back to them.  10.  say "you seemed like you were in a bad mood today."   11.  think their music is superior to others.  12.  don't bother to involve you in things.  13.  think they're "all that and a bag of potato chips".  14.  say "no, it's a waste of film" when you ask to have your picture taken.  15.  say they're joking, when obviously they're not.  16.  look at the food you're eating in digust and say "ewww what the hell is that?". god, grow up.  17.  strongly object to something you're excited about. (i.e. getting your eyebrow pierced.)  18.  talk loudly on the bus about something no one cares about, but they think they do.  19.  talk/hang out/ flirt  with the guy(s) you like, when they know you like them.  20.  and finally... i hate how people look at you like you shouldn't be somewhere.    well, there you have it. quite a long list, i must say. that's all i have to say about that... someday, i'll make a list of things i like about people. someday.  i'd scream this song right in your face- if you were here.  kayte.
