I'm almost never allowed to go out and do anything, especially at night. They think it's normal for a teenager to spend their evenings at home with the family. I get so bored of it and being cooped up in this damned house all the time. Go figure I sneak out just about every night. So yesterday, I asked my mom if I could spend the night at a friend's house.  "No."  "Why not?"  "I don't like sleepovers. And I don't get a good impression from ______." (Don't want to mention names)  I go through this bullshit EVERYTIME I ask to do something. And it's almost NEVER a yes.  So yesterday I just blew up at her and started screaming. Apparently, she doesn't think my car should be used for driving to hang out with friends. Its purpose is for "driving to work, school, or a community service activity." Bullfuckingshit. That's not why teenagers own cars. If that's what it was solely meant for, then fuck the car, I don't want it. Then she goes on to condemn all of my friends, telling me that she has the right to CHOOSE who I hang out with. And she thinks that I will develop a social life through a job and volunteer work. Um, NO. My curfew is at fucking 10:30pm, and I don't even get to EXERCISE the fucking thing because I'm never allowed out! I'm going to have a brain aneurism if I have to spend one more fucking day in the house, do one more chore for her, waste more of my gas on favors for her, or hear a word about community service or getting a fucking job. So today we fought again at the dinner table, and this time, she took my car keys away and threw my clothes and belongings out the window. That was our latest encounter. I nearly resorted to leaving the house for three days, and I would have if my rides didn't turn me down. Amber tried to drive her mom's car here, but she got lost. And Aaron was going to have me stay in LA with him for three days, but his girlfriend is opposed to the idea, and his mom didn't want him driving down here at night. So much for the vacation-from-the-parents idea. Oh fucking well. I'll just have to face the music  again  tomorrow. GRRRRR!!
