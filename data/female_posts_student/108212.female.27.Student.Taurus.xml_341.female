This is my first and only published piece - hope you don't mind if I get a little excited.    It's a gospel-style cantor + SATB piece, based on James 1.  It's available from   urlLink GIA publications   (now, I assume - I received the printed copies today), # G-5369.    They've published it as part of their Leavensong series, which is a new one on me - haven't seen this series before.    Anyhow, thanks to Malcolm the K, who convinced me to submit it, and to all of you, whose missives I look forward to every day, and help inspire me to write.  I am just so incredibly happy right now...    Jay
