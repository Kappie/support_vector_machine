I am sorry, if I could I would post during the day, but I am just not home enough to do so. I was luckly home early today, so I was able to post more. Today (July 26th, 2004) is my day of relaxation. As a birthday present, Adam said he would work in my place, any day of my choosing. So I chose today, when I wake up later I will post on this website all day. I will also try and figure out what is going on with Abby, Jackie, and Ian. Ian also said to be prepared to have another member to the website. I think he is going to try and get Abby to join in on the fun! I can not wait to see a picture of how much Abby has grown. She is the same age as Ian so I want to see if she is still a perky happy girl like she used to be when I was around. She was so cute when I first met her, so let's see how much she has changed.
