I didnt go out last week much either. also cos i was feeling sick. On the 25th of May, ONE DAY AFTER MY BIRTHDAY (my b-days on the 24th) I put my hand through a glass door. I wont say why cos my reasons pretty pathetic and nobody but my parents belives me. I was rushed to hospital but my mum who came back about HALF AN HOUR AFTER IT HAPPENED WHEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THAT SHE SAID SHED BE BACK IN FIVE MINS. she lied, i cried. Well, actually, as a matter of fact i didnt cry because i think i mightve been in shock or something. I got cut at the bottom of my fingers, you know, where they reach the palm and a mm higher or something. All the flesh was cut open and shit and you could see my bone in my middle finger and OH MY GOD. When they first took the dirty dryed-tea encrusted kitchentowel off my wound, my mum made me look away. But when I went to the bathroom, I had a look myself.   The doc said id cut through about 40 per cent of my nerve tenden and but luckily it would be fixed soon. Pwew. well its been about 6 weeks since that happened and im fine now. It was cool but cos i didnt have to write for 6 weeks so i just sat in class and dozed off. But I COULD play my guitar. woop woop. what a bludge of a term it was! the whole of 2nd term! bliss!
