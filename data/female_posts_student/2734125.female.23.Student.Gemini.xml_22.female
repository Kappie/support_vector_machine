Its a gentle cushion that blurs the edges, and it feels like it's slightly patronizing.  Only three fourths of the way awake, and already the day looks long.    When I got home from Denver this Sunday I received a gift.  Sitting on our kitchen table was a lovely plant for me, and cut flowers for my other female roommate.  Thank you mysterious stranger(s), I have it in my office now, in a warm and sunny, but not in direct sunlight place.  This is taking far too long to write, slow fingers, slow mind.  I have far too much to do to have slow mind today...  Nothing is making sense, and my mind is too fragmented today... Maybe tonight it will have settled...
