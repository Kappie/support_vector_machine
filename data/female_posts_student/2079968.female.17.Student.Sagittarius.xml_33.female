Think about it...we're all gonna die...so like, why not die in bliss eating a delicious hamburger, if God wills it, instead of die by gunshot or being burned or tortured and the last thing on your mind is just a bunch of horrible stuff?  I'll get back to yas on this...I have a lot of thinking to do on this issue.  All because I wanted a hamburger.
