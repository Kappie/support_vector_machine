Then we bought a new shower curtain. I will explain.  Actually we bought the mattress a while ago and it just happened to be delivered today. It's one of those really really nice Tempurpedic ones. Not that you care. I am just trying to show how crazy my mom is and just how much money she spent today.  The lamp we orderd last week also arrived today. It's wierd ana kinda funky. I like it though. Anyway, it defies description so you will just have to come see it.  Oh yes! And they bought Kathleen and brand new 2004 electric blue Honda Civic. It is a beautiful car. And I got to drive it before her! hahah! With her having a new car that means I get her old car (it's not a bad 1997 Oldsmobile Cutlass) and I don't have to drive the stinky Subaru! It's just swell.  After all of this buying funanaza my mom and I went to Fred Meyer. We got distracted and found ourselves buying a whole bunch of new stuff for the bathroom. (Mariatina will need a towel!) And ended up with a new shower curtain and 4 towels to match. Then we bought groceries.  AND THE BEST PART WAS.... I FINALLY FINISHED CLEANING MY ROOM!!! It's beautiful!!  As is Cold Mountain.  Tomorrow is a driving lesson (yeah i know its ridiculous) and cleaning Mariatina's future room.  Thats all for now.  Love, Caitlin  "Let no one ever come to you without leaving better or happier."
