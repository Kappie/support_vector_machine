What would be the best and worst things about waking up one day and finding out you had been turned into a walrus?   Best:  I'd have an excuse and the ability to drop out of school. Worst:  No more quarts of Haagen Dazs Chocolate ice-cream.  2.  For whom does the bell toll?  More importantly, why does the bell toll?   The bell tolls for me, obviously.  It's really all about me.  And it doesn't need a reason to toll.  It just likes me.  That's it.  Just me and my bell.   3.  What are snakes afraid of?   Well, they should be afraid of my father, 'cause I've seen him cut the head off of one with an axe before.  But I don't think snakes are smart enough to be afraid of anything.  4.   Which is your favorite toe?  Why?   This is a tough one, because I try to love all my toes equally.  But since toes can't read, I guess I can play favorites here.  So I'd have to say the one next to my little toe.  I think it feels neglected.  The other toes get lots more attention.  I know how it feels.  5.   Was the movie Gremlins a morality play?  Explain.   Definitely not.  Heck no.  It is however a cautionary tale for kids.  Follow the rules?  No.  Take care of your pets or they might try to kill you.
