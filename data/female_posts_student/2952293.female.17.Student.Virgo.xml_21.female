I have to help her open her mind to the words of Betty Friedan, but she gets into it sometimes. Margaret, Hi! Today was terrrrrrrrible. Maybe it was because Erica and I got home at 4 AM from the march in Washington, D.C. It was great, though! We left at 2 AM Sunday and got in around 10 or so. We had to stick with Fran Lamster, FRAN LAMSTER! Crazy lady. Our bus driver was so weird. He goes, "Maybe I'll find myself a widow" and some women shouts out, "RIGHT HERE!" Then when he let us out at a stop he goes, "Kinky". Why? I don't know. We marched and cheered with all the feminists/feminazis. OOOH Rush-you are a bastard. We sang chants like, "Hey hey! Ho ho! George Bush has got to go!" and "Pro-Life that's not right. You don't care if women die!" and carried signs like "I only trust my own bush!" AHH THAT WAS CRAZY! Cybil Shephard and Ana Gastier spoke, that was cool. It was really fun and moving to be apart of something like that. We left at around 7 and slept a lot. It was so hard to sleep on the bus. At one point, I was half-awake and I felt this arm around me and this body pressed against me. I didn't really understand so I didn't do anything. The next morning I asked Erica, "Did we spoon last night?" Yes, yes we did. We stopped for dinner at Breezewood and ran into these band kids, they were so obnoxious. We were in a hurry and carrying hot soup, but this kid did NOT move! So Erica was like, "HOT coming through!" And he dropped his soda, and that male bastard goes, "Look what you made me do!" Hey, don't blame us you dropped it. Erica just said, "It's your own fault, I don't care." or something. It was nice. We got home at 4 as I said and then slept and went to school for second period. We had a lock down practice and fire drill. Julia grabbed my boob. We kissed at prom and then she felt me up today, we're moving really fast, and I like it. Then the day was bad, I cried a little. I went to Chelsea's after school, and she tried to cheer me up. Congrats on Red/Gold captain my love. She couldn't come to SAT class and that was sad. It was the last SAT class tonight. We didn't do much, but I took pictures of everybody and laughed a lot. I'll miss those times. I have so much homework-goodbye!
