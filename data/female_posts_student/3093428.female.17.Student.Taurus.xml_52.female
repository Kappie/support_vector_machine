I kept seeing Anne and Matt there because there was a girl who looked like Anne and guys who kept sounding like Matt or walking like Matt. Plus, they had a Canada Day on the Wednesday, and Matt, you would've loved it.      Camp was absolutely amazing. I've never spent such a fantastic week with God. Every service spoke to me and worship always ended in tears. I thank God every morning for the life he's given to me and the people he's blessed me with. Even though life will get difficult and you'll get hurt sometimes, it's okay because God will help you work things out. God loves me and it's still hard for me to grasp that. But I know he's there waiting for the day where I will fully comprehend that fact.      Isn't it beautiful?
