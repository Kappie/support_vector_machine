I can hardly swallow, I have this weird pounding on the left side of my head, I have to blow my nose every 28 seconds and I am freezing cold. Despite the fact that it is 90 some degrees outside.  So if you feel like being sympathetic (which i know none of you do) then drop by, or if you can't spare the time call. Maybe my mom will let me touch the phone with my germ covered hands. Not likely.  Yay for me, a day to wallow in self pity.
