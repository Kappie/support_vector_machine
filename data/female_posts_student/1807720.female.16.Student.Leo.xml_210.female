Saw her wearing outfits with more colors that could ever be imagined by the human eye. That was pretty cool and only my second concert ever. (My first concert was Back Street Boys when I was in gr. 5) lol. Oh, the memories. I think I went to the mall on the Weekend, but I can't remember. All that comes to mind is my Summer School teachers voice saying "Don't make plans for the weekend, you have too much to do." That's pretty sad when all I can remember is that. I swear I am like memory challenged in some ways. This is going to sound strange, but like I forget sometimes if I washed my hair in the morning. Sometimes I will be in the shower, look down at the shampoo bottle, and think to myself: Did I already wash my hair!! (As far as I know, no one else does that) I have thrown cutlery in the garbage by accident, took my empty bowl to the laundry room, and when carrying down my dirty clothes from upstairs I took them to the garbage can. It's kind of scary all the things I forget and mix up now. These are things I do at 16 (almost 17....August is coming) and well I hate to imagine what I am going to be like at 40!  Tracking my life back to Monday I remember that at teen night, we all played Kinball. (Fun game) and Chels and I got to teach everyone how to "properly" play the game. I came up with our team name and we called ourselves Neon. Yeah! Of course we won...cause I mean I am like amazingly talented at sports. That's if you exclude baseball because I could only hit myself in the head with that thing like five times. Later that night we went out for dinner at like 8:30 but didn't end up eating until like 9:00. I had an amazing rice bowl at moxies, Andy had steak, and Chels had pasta. Then Chels and I split our favorite - the White Chocolate Brownie. On Wednesday, we went bowling (I won both the 5 and 10 pins games I played) and well we had pizza and pop. That was like the first time I have had pop in months cause I don't drink it much anymore. I am anti- pop. Too much sugar, and bad for the body baby!  Today it was my last official day of Summer School. I suppose you could say I am finished Social 30. I just have to write the diploma next week and that's it. I wouldn't do Summer School again though. I didn't exactly get the mark I know I could have gotten if I had done the program at B.O.B. I got a 71% for now, until the diploma. I can't blow that test. My life depends on it, or ay least it seems. University will be looking at marks, and that is the only 30 mark I will have in at the time they look at my transcrit. I don't want them to be thinking like "Well, if this girl got a 90% in Social 10, 82% in 20, and 70% or somethin' in Social 30...then what is she going to get in her other courses. I suppose it's because I scored BELOW the class average on all the unit tests we did except for one (The one that was based on FACTS, not reading and interpreting) My essays were good for the most part (The last one could of used some work cause we had to write on a topic I didn't feel I could defend my position strongly) Also, if I were to hand in those same essays I wrote at B.O.B. I would have for sure got 100%. I realized how easy and slack our School's Social program is. I did good on all of my assignments too. Plain and simple, I am bad at tests. I understand why now too.  COMPREHENSION . That sums it up in one word. I don't understand what I read. It's frustrating. How do you make yourself understand what you just read???? I still had yet to figure that one out. This is becoming a big problem for me though. I can't achieve what accurately understand or answer questions because comprehension affects my performance on social exams, math word problems, English (that is a big one) and when I study. It kind of reminds me of the time I asked Mrs. J how she like studies and what helps her to go good. She told me: You need to read your texts book. However, when she said that, for EVERY unit test I had previously done I had read over ALL those chapters MORE THAN ONCE. Then one morning that confirmed by issues with reading comp. is when I asked her some Bio questions about how the book said like one thing and the notes totally describe dsomething different. Then she was like "Well it's just the comprehension, they are really the same things," but in NO way, shape, or form did I believe they were the same. I am still confused about that actually. I was confused on the unit test, and confused on the final. I guess you could say that it's frustrating knowing that you know a lot of things, and just can't score the marks you feel should reflect your effort. It's so frustrating you know. Well I mean I know, and highly doubt anyone would care to understand. And GRRRRR my Dad doesn't understand, and was like well you should be studying more for that Diploma. I would like to see him take the course. My Mom at least can except that fact that work my ass off for the marks I get and have, and they they solely reflect MY hard work and effort. It's never good enough for my Dad. I am just never friggin good enough. And I need to score at least 70% on the diploma to keep me near that 71%. 71% is so far the lowest mark going on my transcript...it just can't be any lower. It can't be!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just can't, and I won't let it.  I actually had second thoughts about my career choice today, but yes I am still going to be a Bio teacher no matter what it takes. No matter what I have to do. I just thought about the alternatives. Everyone always says "Chose a job with your strengths and talents." The really of the statement - Well hmmm, I am going against the grain on this one. Math isn't my talent, Chem isn't my talents, and well I would exactly consider Bio one of my talents either. These are my interests. Things I am passionate about (INCLUDING Math, even though it stresses me out and makes me cry like 235 days out the the year trying to understand) This is what I love. I love Bio, I love Chem, and I love math. So, I guess I am just following my heart. I am going to do what I love. Though today I thought about the easy way out. I thought about maybe applying to like some drama related program at University. I thought about how much easier it would be. I wouldn't have to struggle with the math, or be stressed about now understanding Math problems or Chemistry labs. I thought about it. I thought about it until I realized that it's the easy way out. I am not about the easy way. When have I ever taken the easy way out???LOL...Yeah good question. Answer = Never. Some how I always surprise myself with what I am capable of with my 250% best effort towards everything I do. Some people see this effort, some people are blind. Other people just don't really give a shit, but that is just the way it is. Anyways, I realized that I would regret it forever if I chose Drama over Science. Drama is fun, but not a passion. I want create a life that revolves around something that will keep me interested forever.
