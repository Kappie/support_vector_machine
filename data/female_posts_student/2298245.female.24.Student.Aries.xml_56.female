That should tell you everything you need to know. But never mind those keys to Scripture: This intelligent homosexual can tell you the difference between socialism and capitalism in two sentences, thus saving you three-plus hours of excruciating agitprop. (No need to thank me, gentle reader.) Under socialism, we Gays are usually led to a field and shot dead. Under capitalism, we design clothes and decorate houses. Which would you choose?"
