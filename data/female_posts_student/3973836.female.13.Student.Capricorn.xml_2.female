I told my mother I was Bisexual ^_^ I did it casually XD Like I was saying previously, my best friend Katie doesn't like gays or lesbians or bi's, so I brought that up first, and I said, "I don't see why Katie doesn't like lesbians or gays! I would date a chick, so I guess I'm Bi or something, and what if I moved in with Katie when I turn 18, and brought home my girlfriend!? What would she do then?!"And my mom was like, "Yeah, I don't see why she'd be so upset!" I feel sooo much better now that she knows! It's like a huge weight off my shoulders! Now I have to tell 3 people. My father (gonna have to tell him sloooowly, cause I don't know how he'd react), my best friend Katie, and my elder sister, Sam ^_^ I know Sam would support me in any decision I make, cause she wuvs me!! XD So does my father, so if I tell him slow and don't just tell him at breakfast, "Hey Dad! I'm Bi!" then he'll get used to the idea. Katie is the one I'm worried about. I love her like a sister, and I'm afraid that she's gonna lose it, but I guess I don't have a choice. I'd rather tell her now, right before I go to Kentucky, so she has 2 weeks to think about it while I'm gone, and then when I get back, maybe her mind will have changed about it. I guess if I'm patient and wait, good things will come ^_^ But then again, there's always the chance that nothing will have changed and she'll still not like gays/lesbians/bi's. But I know if she's truly my friend, then she'll accept me sooner or later, and if not, then I move on and find friends who  can  accept me for who I am. I would just rather her adapt, cause I want her to be my friend :P Ah well, alas, if life deals you a crappy hand, throw the cards away and get a beer! XD
