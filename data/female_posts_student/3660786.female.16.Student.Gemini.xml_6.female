There were only 5 teams including ours there. **We were the best** ;)            We were out in the HOT HOT, sun all day for 4 days! ARGH! WE all had to wear the same tank tops with a sports bra under it, so we had 4 straps. The lines made us all look like red and brown Zebras! It hurts so badly! I thought I was going to pass out when they made us do kickline. Then we had some cheerleading exercises... YuCk. I hate cheerleading, it's so ugly. Ballet, modern, and jazz have some value, but cheerleading ICKY POO. I like pretty lyrical stuff. None of that pom-drill stuff, it's just so ugly, so is hiphop, the music is just yucky poopoo. Rock is okay... I grw up to rock.... woo hoo metallica, ac/dc, Aerosmith (may favourite band), def lepard, motley crue, sex pistols, van halen, you name it... but bring in the rap crap and i run. lol... :)            Well that's about it, not much going on here. I am really tired, adn excited to go to church tomorrow... i donno why I am just exciteed for church.
