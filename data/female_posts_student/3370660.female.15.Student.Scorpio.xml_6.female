The first half hour was hotter than hell and extrememly windy- so the majority of our playing was adlibbed(we could barely see the music, let alone able to find the pages). We samba'd through Fascinating Rhythm, swaggered Pirates of the Carribean and marched the Battle Hymn.  Tonight was just a taste of next Wednesday, when we will play for senior graduation. I highly doubt we will sound as good as tonight, I highly doubt that even one of us won't be crying.  Its the end of a friendship- I think Becca finally got it.  Its the end of the year, and perhaps the end to a lot of other superfluous, meaningless relationships I've held onto for too long now.   Current music:  A Day in the Life | The Beatles
