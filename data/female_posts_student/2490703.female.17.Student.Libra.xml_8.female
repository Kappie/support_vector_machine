We had this really funny senior prank that we were going to do, and someone told on us. I was so mad. We were going to get hundreds and thousands of bouncy balls and put them in a hallway and shut the doors so when people came out of class they would be like OOH, bouncy balls. But no, now the teachers are all "prepared" for it and if they catch people doing it, they can't walk at graduation. Isn't that SO gay? I was pretty angry. But I guess I'll have to do something else...I have like a day to think about it. I wonder if they have a senior prank.com...I should look. I'm sure there is, there is EVERYTHING on the internet. Hm....What else has been happening? Did I tell you about that kid that I see everywhere? He is so hot...AHHHH I want to know his name. I'll figure it out someday. OMG! I have the funniest thing to tell you. Yesterday Amanda Pringle and I were driving home from school and we were waving at random people. It was so funny. We'd make wierd faces as we were waving it was so much fun. While we're driving I'm like we should get bags and put them over our heads then go out with them on and wave at people. We then got the bright idea to cut out eye holes and draw on faces. So we make these bags...we called them bag heads. We go out in my truck, Amanda is the only one wearing a bag on her head, and start waving at random people. It was so funny. They would give her and I the wierdest looks. AHAHAH. So we decide to go to our friends houses and do crazy things in the bags then run away. So we go to Laura Gadzinski's house...she wasn't there, but her brother Steve was...it was so funny. He was like Melissa you are so wierd. After, Amanda had to babysit, but her car was broken, so we drove around until we had to pick up one of the kids and go back to the house to watch the kids. After we're all done we go to Kevin Melvin's house. I park the truck where he can't see it and start walking up his driveway with these bag-heads on. We get to his house and he didn't know who it was until her and I started laughing and chanting oogly boogly....oh man. It was so much fun. What would you do if 2 people walked up to your house with bags on their heads chanting wierd things like oogly boogly smoogle? Oh man...It hurts so much from laughing so hard. I honestly had so much fun being SO stupid! Well, I have to go 39 page review packet due Friday that I haven't started. I'll talk to you later!  Peace and Love,  Melissa
