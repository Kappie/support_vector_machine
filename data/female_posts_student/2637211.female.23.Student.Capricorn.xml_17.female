It was a really interesting reading which I outlined and summarized, but I'm not sure I'll go too much in depth. Let's just say that one of the articles noted that S/M is a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which says the "No one will be tortured, nor subjected to degrading or humiliating treatment." No where is there an exception for consenting adults. Interesting, huh? Think on that next time you think religion is barbarous. "Consenting adults" doesn't just apply to sex and the eroticization of pain.
