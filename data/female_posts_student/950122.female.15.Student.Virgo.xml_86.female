Here's the scoop:  Atlantic City  First, we went to Atlantic City to celebrate my uncle's 24th wedding anniversary. The car ride was uneventful. (Mainly because I slept thru a lot of it) We drove through Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pensylvannia, and NJ. O_o I'm not sure about the order. When we got to NJ, it was so cold! O_o Even colder than Virginia! XD After settling in our rooms for a bit, we went to a casino owned by Mr. Trump.. The guy from the reality tv show 'The Apprentice.' Of course, my cousin, my brother and I weren't allowed to go to the casino. So our parents gave us 20 dollars each to spend in the arcade. XD We  only spent around 5 dollars each. But still we had fun. Our parents had fun also, but they either lost some money or broke-even. Surprisingly, someone hit on mom. Again. O_O  Anyway, we were supposed to go to the boardwalk afterwards, but it was raining, so we just went straight to the Inn. They had an SNES Emulator on the TV (7$ per hour), which my cousin and I played until we fell asleep.  New York  The next day we drove to New York! We got lost on the way there, then we got stuck in morning traffic. XD We went to Times Square, and we saw the Naked Cowboy! :D :D :D It was so cool to be there, even if there were so many people. But when we were looking for a parking space, this guy tried to charge us 44$ for an hour!! O_O That set us on a bad mood. But we cheered up after eating at this small Italian Resto. The owner was impressed at auntie's Italian, so he gave us a hefty discount. n_n Afterwards, we walked 12 blocks to get to the Empire State Building! x_x But when we got there, we found out that we had to wait an hour just to get inside. >_> So we chilled at a Starbucks. I drank the Strawberries and creame.. Yum. We walked 12 blocks back, and we came across a comic shop! I was in heaven, checking out all the comics and manga, but I didn't get to buy anything. *pout* After that, we drove home.   Luray Caverns  The day after that/yesterday, we went to Luray Caverns! The drive there was very serene, because we drove through the countryside. I saw horses, cows, and barns. The cavern was reaaally fun. There was this one part where there was a puddle of water that reflected the ceiling perfectly. It was so beautiful. The deepest part of the cavern was 160 ft, where there was an organ-thing which used the stalagtites to make music! O_o It used rubber plungers to lightly tap the stalagtites to create notes. It was wonderful to hear. Then there ws a wishing well as we were going up. I didn't have any US coins on me, so I threw in two 5 peso coins. XD  When we got out, there was a garden maze nearby. So my cousin and I went through it. (We got discounted because the registrar thought I was below 13 years old. x_x) There were gnats everywhere, but we had a lot of fun running around the maze and finding the 4 goals. There was this one point were we met up with 3 guys who started whistling when they saw us. O_o We eventually found our way out, with four goal stamps. After that, we drove home, and again, I slept through most of it.  Today  Nothing much happened today. We went to Jeth's college to fix his application for summer classes. I saw my first squirell! XD We stayed in McDo for nearly an hour and a half, and went grocery shopping after dropping Jeth off at his dorm. My cousin and I dug up her old NES, and now there are three screens in her room. n_n;;
