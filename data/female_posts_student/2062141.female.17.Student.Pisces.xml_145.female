Me and Jordann cut 6th period Journalism today (sub), i drove around Renton making sure I knew the way to the Renton Village theatre (and guess what??? I DO!!!) then I went to Charlotte's to hang with her and Zack, and totally kick Zack's ass at MarioKart... lol I am STILL the master... then me and Charlotte went out cruisin', and picked up Erinn on the way, and spontaneously went to the mall... to do nothing... oh wait not nothing I got this horrendously awesome Elvis clock, the legs move back and forth! *Uh huh huh*. Oh shit it's cool. I put it above my massive wall of CDs. As soon as I got home at 6:30 I had to take Jeana and her little friends to McDonalds and to their dance.. ..LOL. Elementary school dance. Holy crap that just tickles my funny bones to no end. It's like a ho-down. Sigh funniness. See Jeana made me take her cause it's cooler than Mom taking her. Lol. And now I'm doing this. Up to speed? Good.  Charlotte/Erinn: Girl night tomorrow! YAY! Chick flicks and grape soda all the way. Hell yes.
