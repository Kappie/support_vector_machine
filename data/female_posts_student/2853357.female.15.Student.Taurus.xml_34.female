(because my dad didn't care what time we slept, as long as we got at least 8 hours of sleep...) i told her i write best at night and finally pushed it till my [official] bed time was at 12, and i could stay on the computer... but no internet or fone calls *suddenly laughs hysterically*. and she was sound asleep 20 minutes later and i was on the internet... oh ya, got a call from gina at about 12 *smirks* but i hade to hide under my covers and gina was in her closet... and i mean come on... thats the time i get FREE MINUTES!  okok, back to today... what happened? nothing.   then i remember browsing around the internet and stuff, and being totally bored to death.  i typed up 8 pages last night... but i can't do anything today... my capacity to think is drained...   and now i'm listening to michael bubl√© (BUBBLES! LOL)...  and tino emailed me again, and she's wondering why i'm never on aim (fyi, she doesn't know about my other sn... so DONT TELL HER OR I SWEAR I WILL KICK YOUR ASS)   um... um... oh ya, i cleaned today too. haha... i demolished the three piles school work on my floor to one very small stack of papers and junk, but i didn't feel like tackling those... i think after that i should clean my closet... its a mess. i was poking around in this bin and there was hella random shyt in there...   oh, i wanted to write a MWPP... but i'm in the middle of another, so i'm torn... plus i can't write anyways, i wrote hard for the last three nights... and now my imagination is stripped bare... AND HP IS STILL DOWN, IM ABOUT TO HAVE A BLOODY HEART ATTACK IF THE DAMN WEBMASTER, JAY, DOESN'T HURRY UP!    damn you people, and you don't even care! why do i bother... because a stupid cousin mine decided to get me hooked... who now isn't even interested in the same topic i am anymore... DAMN HER! *huffs* something about orlando bloom or josh groban or something or other...  which reminds me, she started spouting random names and told me to look them up (because pathetic old me didn't have a clue the girl was talking about) and then gave me what she thought of them and their 'datability'... that poor mixed up filipina american brain of hers...  then she came to a deigo luna who i SWEAR looked like those two mexican twins... diego luna stared in dirty dancing: havana nights and y tu mama tambien (WHOSE DIRECTOR DID THE CRAP JOB OF DIRECTING HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN... sorry, i'm very touchy about that...)  and dad just came in and took over my computer. said soemthing wasn't right with the sound and started playing random josh groban music... haha, it was my aunt, who hooked my dad, who hooked my family, me included, who hooked gina...  btw, french is a funny language, no offense. but it's absolutely facinating how the words are comared to how they sound, so unlike english... but I STILL HATE THE FRENCH SONGS!    which reminds me... SOMEONE was spouting random tagalog and me, who doesn't speak any other language [fluently] other than english was BUGGING me... i blame my parents. *points at them*  i've decided i have to name the little purple boinging thing tita sarah gave to me... ITS SO COOL! (i found it again while going through my closet!) am i pathetic for naming it? i probably am, but i'm not in a caring mood right now... HE CAN BE MY MUSE! OMG! [i've suddenly decided it looks like a he] ya... i'll come up with a name...    wow, and that's the play by play account of my day... well, at least, what i can remember of it ;P (gee, i think i actually kept my fone calls to gina under 10 today! i think i talk to her too much... she's starting to rub off on me...)  i'm sorry to say that my fans probably won't get to hear what happens after i finish typing this... they'll be torn! *sob sob*   am i little weird today... ignore EVERYTHING you read above previously... i was ranting... but, it's good to rant. gets it out of your system.  hope you're having a nice life... ta patty
