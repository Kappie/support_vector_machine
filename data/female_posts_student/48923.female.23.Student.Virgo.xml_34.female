(and i've visited people who have only a few spices in their spice rack, and i start to twitch just because how could anyone live without _________?)  yeah, so back to the spice catalogue...  the most recent issue spotlighted something i never liked before,  urlLink carrot cupcakes .    and i've decided now, after dirtying my entire apartment with orange paw prints, that i will never hand grate carrots again.    one of the levels of hell must involve grating foods by hand.  of course, i had thought grating carrots would be a breeze (how quickly i forget how much i hate even grating cheese, let alone a hard, wet, flimsy carrot) and i'd whip up some healthy treat in minutes.  my logic circuits must get blocked when the spice catalogue is involved.  i think even the recipe suggests a food processor, which just happens to be one of those million other kitchen applicances i actually don't own.   but, now that i've grated part of my thumb off, i must chant  "carrots go into the food processor, food processor, food processor.... or else blood gets into the carrots, the carrots, the carrots..."   -- baking is apart of my world domination as a granny plan.  nothing else in my life is planned out except the fact that i will be  that   crazy old woman who lives close to a college campus, and tells all the youngins about life ever so long ago, as i tempt them with my old fashioned treats.   by then i hope to unlock the mysterious of my genetic ability to make candy and other sweets, which i know will one day come to me like a little burst of irish luck..  of course, after my irish forefathers decide to forgive me for hating their beloved potato.
