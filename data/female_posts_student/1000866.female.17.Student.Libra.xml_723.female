I hate, hate, HATE when girls take dvantage of guys. They use them.   2. I also hate when girls play with guy's minds. It's just really inconsiderate. OK, playing with guy's minds is ok sometimes. It's funny if it's a little bit, but if there's the potential for someone to get seriously hurt emotionally, it's not cool at all.  Besides that, my day was excellent. Superb. It ended up being Diane, Kelly, Jessica, Alex, Matthew, and myself. it was super fun. I got to ride all the big coasters except Iron Wolf. We all kind of decided not to bother with that one. It was so crowded though. That was kind of a bummer but it was really fun nonetheless. We went on Raging Bull twice at the end of the night. the first time we got to the top and we're like, well, if we go in one of the middle cars, we can probably get through another time, so when we finished with the first ride on Raging Bull, we ran for the entrance and we made it. First row. Last ride of the night. It was excellent.   Superman scared the living daylights out of me. I was so, SO scared. The thing I'm most scared about with coasters is that the harnesses will break and with Superman, all you have is the harness! So, so scary. Diane didn't help!!!! She liked watching me squirm. :) Haha. Anyway, it was a really, really fun day. However, I'm super, super tired right now and I really need to get some sleep. Good niiiight all. Oh yes...I also have the story of my adventures with Mary Clare at the movies yesterday. Wow...so much to still write about but no time...
