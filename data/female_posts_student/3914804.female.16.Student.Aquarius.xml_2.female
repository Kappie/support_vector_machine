I love fiddling with fonts, and if there's one complaint I have with these blogs it's that there's very little choice of font and they're all boring!!     Anyway...    King Arthur! Happens to be one of my favourite legends (although I prefer still more the way the Pythons take it off in The Holy Grail, sooo funny... The intelligent, political proletariat - "Hey, we're a democracy [or whatever they said!] Just cause some watery tart handed you a sword..." heehee! Going off on a bit off a tangent there but that's what Monty Python does to you... Lot of ellipses today. Anyway, how DARE they use this legend as ANOTHER film made purely to carry Keira Knightley!? If you've seen Pirates of the Carribbean - which had the one redeeming quality of a wonderful, hilarious, eyeliner (but not lipgloss!:-( ) wearing Johnny Depp (actually that one redeeming feature led me 2 c the film more times than I'd care to admit...) who looked particularly excellent contrasted against the wooden "acting" (pah!!!) of Orlando Bloom  , and Keira Knightley, whose acting "talent" seems to consist of pouting when scared, pouting when angry, pouting when in luurve, etcetera, you'll know what I'm talking about.    Bit of a rant there, tis true...    Been on a long, long walk with my silliest dog and my mum, my feet are blistered!!    Must go, tea awaits on the table... May write again later on my return, but for now, adieu!
