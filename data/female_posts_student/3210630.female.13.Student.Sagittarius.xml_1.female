(it's to the tune of that starbucks expresso shot commercial where they go roy! roy roy roy!)  "ham! ham ham ham! ham ham haaaaaaam haaaaaaaaaaam... ham's the food! nutritious and filling. got your bacon got your luch meat! comes from a pig, *clap*, innocent pork. then. it's. HAM" it was really stupid but it's fun. i swear i could be on the wiggles or something. anyway, that's it. oh last night my cousin natalie was really gettin on my nerves and was saying really mean stuff about people not as "cool" as her. when i said it wasn't respectful to say that about other people, she goes, (now this is a direct quote, people)  " NEVILLENATNAT: i didnt even mean to type that     NEVILLENATNAT: my fingers just type    NEVILLENATNAT: i wasnt even looking at the keyboard "    she was being so mean, and then swearing that her fingers just randomly type and she has no idea what she's saying. LAME. so then my friend sage, being as crazy as she is, asked for natalie's screen name so she could "mess with her". it was hilarious. sage was asking natalie how she stood on the topic of sexuality and people being gay, 'cause sage is gay and she was "taking a poll" (just an excuse to talk to her). it was so funny. you had to be there. anyway, gotta go. orthodontist appt. i might actually get my braces off. i've had them for four years. alrite. yeah. bye.
