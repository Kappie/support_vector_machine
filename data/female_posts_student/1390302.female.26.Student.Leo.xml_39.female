The Supreme Court of the United States have issued a recent ruling in the case of Lawrence  Garner vs. the State of Texas that would make even the most skeptical or radical think twice about their own opinion of freedom.  In a 6 to 3 decision, the US Supreme Court struck down so called “Sodomy Laws” in the state of Texas, making it unconstitutional for two men, or women, to be arrested for non-commercial, sexual acts in private.  If I had been asked before this ruling had come forth, I would not have believed that such a body would make such a ruling.    It is my opinion that it is not the responsibility, or business, of the law to govern social issues.  The law is to protect our liberties –liberties that they so often infringe upon.  From the platform on which I stand, gay rights are a social issue, and not one that the supposed “veil of ignorance” which shrouds the law has any right to decide upon.    The argument has been made that should gay and lesbian citizens be granted the privilege to marry, it would lead to a decline in opposite sex marriages.  This idea is ludicrous to say the very least!  Granting gay rights will not make more gay people, and currently the gay populations stay unmarried.  So, if gay men do not marry strait women, and lesbian women do not marry strait men, I ask how there could be a decline in strait marriage?  Allowing same sex marriages would change very little in the grand scheme of things.      I suppose that there are a number of “closet” homosexuals that exist in the world, yet I believe that they would still exist no matter the laws.  Homosexual people who do not admit their true sexuality generally behave this way for fear of social stigma.  In a society where a gay man can be tied to a fence and beaten to death, the social fear of persecution is a major factor in rejection and denial of sexual orientation.  Religion is another factor in such “closet” behavior, as are family, and friends.  In the end, the law plays a very small factor in the way people act socially, especially concerning very sensitive issues such as sexual orientation.  The prejudice of the law -in a government that is supposed to be indifferent- has forced the highest judicial body of the United States to decide on something that is not now, and never was their business in the first place.  The court has overcome all pressures and prejudices to prove that perhaps freedom is the most important thing after all.  America is a country that is founded on the basis of freedom for all, not freedom for some.    I have ever hoped that people –at the very core of them- had learned to overcome societal prejudice for the greater good of its citizens. People are people, weather gay or strait, black or white, old or young, and every single person in this world should have an equal opportunity to not only survive but also strive and be himself or herself.  Who you choose to love is your own business, I only find it refreshing that the supreme court believes that freedom to love, or at the very least not be persecuted and thrown in jail for that love is our fundamental right.    When all else fails, the argument could be made that enforcing “sodomy laws” is nearly completely impossible.  I ask how the law enforcement agencies could lock people away for being two consenting adults, consenting?  Law enforcement has a difficult enough time solving violent crime and can barely regulate prostitution –which is sexual deviance right in front of their faces.  Drug addicts, thieves, prostitutes, child molesters, rapists, murderers, and the like are all very serious and very real criminal issue.  How could two people who love each other and want to be left alone to their vices in the privacy of their own homes compare to so many true criminal acts?  ~Kristyn
