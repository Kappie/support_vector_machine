Fuck off. I know you'll never read this, but that's ok. I'm writing in here for me and not for you. You should realize what a horrible person you are. You treat your wife like shit, you're not there for your kids when they need you. What makes you think you're an adequate father at all? If you're not ready for marriage, then you shouldn't have gotten married. And if you're not ready for a family then my god, you shouldn't have made two kids!!! I love the girls and wouldn't trade them for anything in the world, but if you're going to be an asshole and run around like a chicken with its head cut off, then I'm thinking there's something wrong with this situation. I know you didn't get to live the single life and go bar hopping and have your share of one night stands but if that's the life you really want to lead then why would you enter this world instead? YOU'RE JUST FUCKING UP EVERYTHING YOU AND MY AUNTY HAVE BUILT ASSHOLE!!!   Now I'm afraid to go home and sleep because I don't want to get knifed while I'm asleep. So for now, I'm staying at my cousin's house. I know this blog has been veeeery vague, but if you want more, you can ask. If not, have a good day folks! And Outdoor School fitness test, here I come!
