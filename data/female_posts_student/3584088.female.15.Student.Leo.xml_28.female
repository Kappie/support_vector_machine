I've just spent the last week at band camp and ya i know everyone will be going "this one time at band camp...." well band camp isn't like that infact we use that phrase as a big joke sure ppl do hook up and it makes me sick that some of the girls that were freshmen last year we shall just go by their initials NB and JG are total sluts.....But this past week I felt so much power and we were so together i don't think i've ever been this phsyced about band! Well I hope thoes girls change their disposition on being the band sluts and to let it be known NB is a bitch aswell and i personaly don't like the name she's giving to our band....well g2g bye
