My reasons are that firstly, the bond between the seven knights is undescribable.  You can see it in their eyes, in the way they speak to eachother, their actions, their bravery and their loyalty towards one another.  It's amazing and it really touched me.  That alone made the movie.  My two most favorite knights: Galahad and Lancelot.     I read some really mixed reviews on this movie and yes, some things were a bit off.  For example, there were crossbows.. many of them... yet, they really weren't invented for another 100 or so years after the time period this story takes place in.  Guinevere wasn't as much as a wench in the movie as she is in the myth.  Then again, it IS only a myth and therefore there are various ways to represent it and different takes on it.  Lancelot: There is a large number of lonely men out there.  Guinevere: Don't worry, I won't let them rape you.  Incredible!
