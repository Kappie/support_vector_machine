When I am sad or hurt, I cry; When I am frustrated, I cry; When I feel as if there is no possible thing I can do or say to help a situation, I cry. But, as quickly as a resort to that measure, I'm finished. My pain soaks in. But what most people don't realize is that just because I don't cry doesn't mean that I don't hurt. Actually, me yelling and carrying on could very well be much better than me staying quiet, because I remember what you people have done to me, and I will never forget it.          I don't trust anyone. I can't even trust my family. I am too afraid of getting hurt, getting disapointed. I can't open up to people, because I'm paranoid. I think I'm finally going to trust someone, and they'll betray me.          My self esteem is now at an all-time low. I feel ugly, I know I'm getting fatter, but I don't have the motivation to change it. And what's worse than my angst about my outer appearance, I think that the  person  that I have become is unattractive as well.          I chase away people, completely unknowingly. I completely fuck up my relationships with those I care about, but I don't realize it until it's too late. And then starts the dwelling...     I frequently alternate between feelings of high self worth and complete and utter disapointment with myself. So people get mad.     I am paranoid and narcissistic. At the same time. And I hate it, but it's me    But I'm Jennica. Incredibly eccentric, friendly to all (even though at times I shouldn't be), fun to be around, and worthy of your love. So, note to all: I'm not as scary as you might perceive me to be.
