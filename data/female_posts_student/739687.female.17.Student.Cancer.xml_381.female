Others were simple-minded tools she would thumb through day after day, using and casually discarding by the break of light seeping under her door.  But not him.  He was a puzzle; a tireless enigma of a trackless mind fumbling in and out of expectation in a way that never ceased to amuse her.  She could never predict what to expect from him. Once she had loved him. Now she simply fell victim to her own curiosity. What plans, what schemes couldbury themselves in his actions? What motives lay behind those exotic eyes...and why did they seem to long for her? Why did feelings of love, or lust, or whatever feelings these were...why did they seem to linger in him?  She...she was through with love. It was nothing more than the well-read novel of a child's fantasy, and she had long since grown. She had grown up, and no longer had time for the surrealism he danced in.  Secretely she longed for one more dance.  But perhaps this time she felt his absence. Perhaps this time her feelings were stronger than before.  He used to tease her. He told her that someday he would leave.  Perhaps this time he had.   She followed I-35 southbound for hours that morning. The sun had not yet broken the day, but she could not stay for the others. They were nothing like him.  As light began to scratch the surface of the sky, she glanced down the road before her.  As the next exit approached she beared to the right, and turned around.   He had not left her yet.
