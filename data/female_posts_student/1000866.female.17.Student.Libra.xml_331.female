Hmmm, we were going to go to this place where you pick out a piece of pottery and you get to paint it and stuff, but that was closed. :( So sad, so sad. So, we just decided to walk around and whatnot. We went to Book Zellers. Haha, I got a scantly clad novel. Haha. It was great. The guy thought we were so weird looking over the romance novels. So, when I went there to buy it, I couldn't look into his eyes. I felt so ridiculous. Heh.   Oh, then we went to Walgreens and I saw Peter!! I didn't know he worked there! I was so excited. He's such a cool kid. :) So, basically we just hung out and talked and whatnot.   I saw this article earlier about this guy with bladder cancer. He had his bladder removed, but the doctor thought he had penile cancer as well, so during the surgery he removed his genitalia along with his bladder, but the man being opperated on didn't know this. Turns out, they tested the cells after the surgery, and the man didn't have penile cancer. Haha, OUCH. That has GOT to stink. Supposedly he's suing for a very large sum. I must say, even with Su-Crazy America, this one makes sense to me. I'd su the pants off those doctors as well. Not literally of course. Heh, I guess it wouldn't matter because that doctor still HAS his genitalia.   And, now I'm done talking about male genitalia...  I think I may go read my novel now. Heh. I'm talking with some people. Band camp should really be interesting. So many people. There's bound to be some fights and whatnot. I think I'm just going to avoid people for the most part next week. Stay out of people's way. Not give them a chance to get annoyed by me and vise versa. Hmmm, I still need to make a list of all the things I need to bring. Maybe I should do that now? Probably, but will I? No.   Hmmm, I could go for some music right now though...La la la...
