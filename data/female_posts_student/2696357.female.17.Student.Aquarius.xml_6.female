Anyways, on a more depressing note, I'm not sure if I will even have a backup date to prom because James's friends are pretty busy.  However, the only good news of the night came at like 9:30 when Tom called me.  He wanted to know if I would like to hang out on friday and I was like why not.  At this moment, I'm waiting for him to get his ass online so I can talk/get to know the guy.  And what do u know??? He just got on.  I'll tell ya how the conversation goes.  ~I'm out~ :)
