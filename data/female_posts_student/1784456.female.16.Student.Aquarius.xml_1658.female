Lynne robyn has just signed in and she thinks dominic monaghan is fit aswell, so there (in case u hadn't guessed ihave him as my foto!) did some more media but got pissed off with the computer (which is why i cant undastand y i am on it now) and decided not to do anymore. anyway cant be bothered to rite anymore, despite the fact that i can think of tonnes to say. will just have to spend tomorrow at skool yabbering on! xoxoxox
