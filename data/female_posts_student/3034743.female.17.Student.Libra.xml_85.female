It is even better because Hal Sparks is in it! Oh yeah! Speaking of hot guys, I am going to try to make a resume tomorrow so I can turn it into Hollywood Video. That would be cool if I had a job there. It would be nice having the extra money. Good stuff. I got my report card back today, and I'M RANKED #1! I'm pretty sure that Bri is too, but I'm glad that I finally caught up. The past two days have been good, to sum things up. Tomorrow Alex and Holli should be coming over. That should be fun.
