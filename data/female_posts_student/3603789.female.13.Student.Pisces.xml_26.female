It is a pleasure to have you on this blog, and I definitely know you. And your mom. She helps the Education Foundation, right? My parents are there too. Garrett. Your blog is catchinging up to mine, but as time speeds on to elections, it is probably more important. Love you to G. Meg, I owe I you a special apology, for I haven't been here and I am not ignoring you. It has taken me a whole night to get up to date with the blogs. Were still going to Germany, but I'm running out of ideas of where and what to do there. Well, now I have to go to soccer camp. So, see you all later.  P.S. U, why did you gie me the reins? Thank you anyway. And apoligies to all.
