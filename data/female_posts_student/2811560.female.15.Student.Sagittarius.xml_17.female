Anyways, so I'm in 7th period today and I got this letter that said: "All meetings with Mr. Perkins scheduled for today and tomorrow have been canceled. Mr. Perkins has withdrawn his acceptance of the position." Right there is where I almost fall over in front of my entire English class. Man, I was apalled. Crazy, crazy stuff. So I wonder who will be our director now. Anyways, my cold is still here. That sucks majorly. After wind ensemble Jeff, Cory, Renee, Kelly and I had this great biblical debate about whether being gay is wrong or not. That was interesting. I say if you wanna be gay, you be gay. If two people who happen to be gay love each other and they want to be together, then let 'em. What the hell.
