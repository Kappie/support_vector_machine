I know, I know, I haven't been back from Costa Rica even a full week yet and I already started feeling the old familiar pity party starting back up again. I felt like nobody really cared because no one bothered to call me when some people were going to go see a movie. Really childish, yes, because I do know better. It wasn't one of my better moments; I felt like convincing myself that the world DID revolve around me, I WAS the center of the universe, everyone should care about ME, cater to MY needs because I'M the only one that matters or who has feelings or wants to be taken care of. But then I realized how retarded I was being and moved on to being depressed about other things that don't deserve to be discussed on this blog.  Anyway, my point is, what really made me stop being depressed and start contributing positive vibes to society again is I remembered that it's not about ME. I'll admit that I didn't read all of The Purpose-Driven Life, but I definitely read the first sentence, and that's what it is: It's not about YOU. There's more to life than not being invited to see a movie with some people, there's more to life than not seeing your friends when you want to or missing out on something you thought you were going to get to do. Who knows what kinds of things you could end up doing instead of what you planned? God's in control of EVERY situation, and even if it pisses you off at first, the only thing for it is to make the best of what you're stuck with. God doesn't switch things around because you throw a hissy fit and whine about it for hours. He's happy to listen to you, of course, but he wants you to trust him that he knows what's best for you. And right now I'm even trying to convince myself to do this, because it's not the easiest thing. I'm still having problems figuring a few things out, and remembering how to act when certain people are around. And yeah, I'm a little upset at the way things have been going for me, and the stuff I've been putting myself through by complicating things isn't too fun either. But God is in control. He knows what's best for me, and I will love what he's decided for me.   Even so, it's hard to remember. After all, I'm only human.
