I have to say that I've gotten pretty tired over the past couple of years of feeling pressured to make my web sites perfect, and I'm a little scared that if I were to start back up with that again, I wouldn't update enough. So, here I am back to the famous blog! I'm not sure if my thoughts are interesting, and it makes me laugh to think of my life as 'intriguing', but hey, maybe you'll learn something from this - who knows, maybe I'll learn something from this!  As I sit here trying to think of a way to sum up my life for you in one sentence, I'm reminded of a quote that a friend of mine and I made up a while back - " I have no life, but I'm a VERY busy person! " That's a good way to put it! I've done some cool things here and there so far, and I hope to add to the list in the future. I love all of my friends more than anything, and I hope to make a difference somehow, someday.  Well, that's enough for now. I'll type again later.
