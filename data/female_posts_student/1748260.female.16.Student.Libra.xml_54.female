The 2nd lesson teacher.. coz I was suppose to have 2 lessons today..10.15am - 1.15pm. But the 2nd lesson lecturer didn't come... which was supposed to be office computing. Haha kinda lame her lessons the day before was typing some rubbish. Ok so we sat around like idiots  took our break after that because we still had to attend a Self Esteem talk at 2.15pm.. Kinda crappy I should say. Haha..Ended at 4.15pm  went to clementi area to have a filet-o-fish...Walked towards the interchange at around 5.30pm. Ok another day in church... it's always peaceful  great. Well I ALWAYS LOVED GOING TO CHURCH! Hai but sadly could not join them for dinner as I had to be home by 10pm! Took a cab home  here I am!
