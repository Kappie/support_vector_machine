Please forgive me, for I do not mean to say some of the things I do it's just that sometimes things just come out of my mouth and later I regret them.  I am feeling like the best friend relationship between Chelsey and I may be in jeopardy so I would ask if you please just help make everything alright.  I feel we are growing apart, even though she claims that is not happening it feels to me that we are.  But I also would like to thank you God for blessing me with the opportunity so meet so many amazing people and I am thankful for their help along the way.  I thank Mrs. J for trying to help me with Chemistry because I know she didn't have to do that, I thank you for her in my life because she is making Chem alot easier for me right now and she is alot more supportive than my T.A.  But I also do thank you for my T.A. because even though she can't help me with Chem it is nice to have some else that can be there more me.  I am also thankful for all my friends and I am thankful for having Chelsey in my life still because I really needed someone there for me this week more than ever, and she was there so thankyou.  But God you also know how hard I work at everything, and you know how much it means to me to make at least Honours, please help me to have confidence in myself that I can do this because lately negative thoughts have been going through my mind.  I suppose I am going through a hard stage in my life right now but in the end I know it will make me a stronger person but I ask that you help me through this hard stage right now.  I am having thoughts about my future career again and I am very serious about it but you know how I want to be a Science Teacher well I am not very good at Physics and not very good at Chem and well that is just how things are - but please, Oh God Please, bless me with the gift of Biology if you only had any idea how much I want this to work.  I could not image doing anything but teaching when I am older, it is what the voice in my head is calling.  My conscience is so strong right now and is has been for a while and I have known since grade 7 that teaching is my calling in life.  Please bless me with the gift of Biology because I know with my hard work and effort, and your blessing that I can accomplish anything.     Thank you God for listening.
