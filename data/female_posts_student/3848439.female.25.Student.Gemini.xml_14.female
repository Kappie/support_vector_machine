And I've been getting it from different circles of friends and associates, so I know it's dang well time to do something about it.  I  know  I'm dour.  I  know  I'm a stick in the mud.  I  know  my friends and loved ones usually have to use a crowbar to force me to talk about my feelings.  I'm a bit emotionally locked up.  So here's the deal.  Of the 4 folks reading this blog, I encourage you to challenge me to be a bit forthcoming with my emotions.  I encourage you to tell me I need to find something to actively smile about each day - even laugh if I'm feelin' really frisky and daring.  I'm sick to death of being the grimacing brick wall.  But old habits die hard and I'm cranky and cynical deep down.  But we all know it's only to the bitter candy coating to my more sensitive and feeling and romantic side.  Urgh.  Yeah.  And we fear nothing as much as those things we don't face.  So I'm facing it.  My 25th year will be better then my 24th - not that the 24th was bad, mind you.  I've fully hit my quarter-life crisis and it's time to take stock and change my path if I'm not going to end up some lonely neurotic nut job by my midlife crisis.  Hopefully I can be a friendly, engaging neurotic nut job by then.
