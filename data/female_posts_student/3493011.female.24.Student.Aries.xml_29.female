Funny how we always say "God is BIG", "I know God is above all things", "God can change circumstances" blah blah blah... but I muz admit that even though I say those stuff, most of the time, I kinda say it without really comprehending and experiencing the "truths" in the statements and of cos, past experiences tend to be hazy and I kinda forget how good God can be...  Yes, now let me get to the point, I was going to work and in my heart, I don't feel like workin at all today cos I've got my chapter at the back of my head... my chapter is without much progress... but work is work and I have to be a responsible worker (I take pride being a Fish and Chips gal)... on my way, Mian called me to say that she's working today and ask if it's alright that we swap and I agreed.. I was bursting in my heart "Yeeeahhhhhhhhhh" so I went to uni to collect newspaper and I saw my Sook... and her brother.. ok we chat abit... and I came back to my place..went to do grocery shoppin (again?!) and as per usual I came home with more things then needed... But the point I'm trying to make is God answers prayers...  Then, I was thinking "Aiyah do my chapter, sian..." I came online to check mail and Praise God!! Audrey told me to hand in my draft next week and she'll see me next week... hahhahahah wah striking lottery wldn't be so lucky hhmmm this is obviously not luck but God's hand in every little things that we do... I muz say Jesus is in the center of every little things we do... for instance, this BLOGGG entry !! I'm bouncing with joy... Juz now, I apologised to Jac for my edginess in regards to her situation.. and the next entry will be for her...   Talked to Greg last nite.. it's been so long since we last catch up on each other.. and I miss the good o'days of clubbing, talking nonsenses with him, manja-ing to him and for him to rescue me when I'm dead drunk... yups, he's my best bud.. Greg, I miss you...ok better explain that I miss him as a fren juz in case someone gets...hee hee.. Actually, I'm kinda worried abt Greg now... hmmm.. he didn't want to tell me abt his problem and I can only tell him that I'll pray for him... yes, I feel bad that I can't be there for him through his difficult moments... Sorry Greg..   Greg was rather taken aback when I told him about me and Terence being together... He thinks that we got together too soon, citing that we don't really know each other well enough... Yes, greg got a point..but I don't really care and I'm happy with my choice.. Everyday, I feel like I'm on a rollarcoaster ride at the carnival... this Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee feeling I have inside is so intense!!! I'm deeply in love with him and there's nothing I wanna change... I know Greg cares for me and I truly appreciate his concerns...He said, "This is shocking.. I know you for so many years and he don't even know you.. yet you guys got together... this is so weird.. muz tell Vishnu"... Somehow, I think the reason why me and Greg never work out, coz we see facets of each other that we dislike or can't stand... I know he finds me extremely irritating at times... if we'd gotten together, I don't think we can even be friends if things don't work out... so this relationship of being juz friend wrk out fine... like I wrote to him many years ago... we can be friends for life rather than spoil it all.. He deserves a better gal anyway...I'm juz pure nonsense hahhahahahahhaha... Besides, God has His plan for me... that is to be with Terence!!   For now, I'm juz blissfully in love...
