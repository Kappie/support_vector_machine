I wrote Principal Miller a letter to get her to bring the dance team back. I think it's pretty convincing, and we put on there that she should scheduale a meeting for us to discuss it. It would be SO cool if she brought it back finally!  In 2 weeks I have 2 pick up my scheduale at the school. We have a new French teacher too! Her name is Mrs. Melha Woods... her hubby Mr. James Woods, is teaching Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. Mrs. Hart is teaching Physical Science, General Biology, AND Health now. Talk about multi-tasking...
