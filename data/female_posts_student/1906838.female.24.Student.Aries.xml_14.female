Omigoodness , i have never walked so much in my life. well.. no thats a lie .. i have walked a lot before but havent done so in ages .. and this afternoon omigod .. up and down up and down and along this corridor and that.. wonder how many calories ive burnt? hahaha.. ive probably compensated for the calorie loss with the cheese and onion sandwiches i made for my bekal today ...  i made one more sandwich than usual cos i am, as defined by the low-batt pager hanging onto my belt, on acute on call for WARD 40. hahahah .. its actually not even half as grand as it sounds. i know when my friends in the years above me had to be on call i used to think it was exciting .. i suppose it could be if not for the fact i have my exams looming ahead of me .. this huge dark boulder which is blocking my view of the holidays. but nah .. the SHO oncall had acknowledged herself that she doesnt expect me to hang about because of the coming exams.   hahaha.. the biochem essay for dr m is finally coming into existence .. having procrastinated about doing it the last two weeks, i finally decided to sit down and do it last night.. well i have the anapleurotic role of the TCA cycle all sorted out .. now just have to link it all to the cases of trupti patel and sally clarke.   yesterday, the stress of the exams and the portfolio preparations really got to me. golliwog says i just think too much.. and too fast. he said IF i could do work at the same rate as the rate at which i think, id have all my work done in no time. he taught me a technique yesterday .. which i have tried but yet to see its positive affect on my emotional self control .. hahah.. golliwog does act like he's my personal psych sometimes. he told me to .. whenever i feel myself panicking .. or whenever i am needing a break.. to clear my mind.. just empty it and not think of anything. he says its because im always thinking that i always seem to be the world's greatest worrier. thank u sayang .. god i miss him sooo much. He kept saying it wont be long before we see each other again .. but i dont really like him to remind me because it also meant that it wont be long before my exams.   ohhhh ... the prank calls have stopped. thank god .. the minyak ive been saving in that old nescafe jar was beginning to stink .. muahahahahahhaha .. ( *evil laugh again*)
