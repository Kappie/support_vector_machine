Lots of stuffs been happening, I do have another motorcycle ride lined up...whenever I can apologize to the guy whos supposed to give me one for missing the first date we set. I'm not looking forward to THAT at all.  Oh well. C`est la vie....Such is life. But this one is good to...Postatem obscuri lateris nescitis. You don't know the power of the Dark Side. So true, so true. but this one is my favorite...     VAE VICTUS!!
