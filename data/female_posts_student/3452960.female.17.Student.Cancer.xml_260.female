She also got stuck in a tree, and I have pictures of that too. Then we had a barbecue, and I ate what turned out to be a raw chicken burger, but it was nice. Then we went down the park afterwards, where we smelt each other, and apparently, I smell the nicest! Yay! Then Bri-y did Me and Penmo's hair for us. What fun it was.
