It's all... jumble-jumble... o.o!   Anyways... out of a week, that's all I have to say. Fun, huh?   Oh! I went to Build-A-Bear Workshop. I was the oldest person there making one. I felt so insecure, but I did it anyways. It's so cute! I made a monkey, which I named Oreo. ^_^! I told my mom about it, and because I'm as bad as she is, she immediately said that tomorrow (Friday) we'll have to go back there and get him another outfit... I then told her that they had furniture for them, too. I'm so spoiled...I love it? =)
