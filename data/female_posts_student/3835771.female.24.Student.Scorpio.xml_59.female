If only I read this quote before I had the chips, the snickers bar and slice of fruit flan. I've been on an eating rampage - i think primarily due to a tad bit of anxiety I'm feeling. Comfort eating is not. a. good. thing.   NB: W.G.P appears in my Collins Desk Calendar I have at work   LovePeaceRespectHumility
