After you hear this enough it starts getting to you. I know that thye mean well but I have had a lot on my mind these past few days and sometimes it doesn't help me much to be reminded of all of the things that make me sad, like being separated from Jesse. I also came to realize that I don't care for family gatherings much any more and it is always so much more fun when Jesse is around. Next weekened is easter and the family has been invited to my Nanu's house for a easter lunch. I don't know if I really want to go, but I know that if I don't I will regret not going to see my Nanu. Most likely I will put on a happy face and go. I know that even if I do go, Jesse will be on my mind the whole time, he always is. I didn't get a chance to talk to him today but I am hoping he calls home in the morning. It would be so nice to hear his voice again.  28 days down..... to many more left to go, and 16 days till our 1 year wedding aniversary.
