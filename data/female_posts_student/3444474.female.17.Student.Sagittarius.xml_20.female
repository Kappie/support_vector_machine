I think I've got a sleep schedule back, albeit a shitty one, but it works, and I can get through the days without being totally dead by 4. So whatever.  I am very cold right now. This building is ALWAYS like a meat freezer, it's ridiculous. I swear, I could cut glass right now, and it's JULY. Can't they just turn it down a little, maybe?  I had to make a purchase order, so they gave me the company credit card...I feel very important right now, lol. I could totally use this credit card for my own personal gain...but I'm not a bitch like that.  In other news, Cameron leaves tomorrow, and this saddens me greatly. He'll be gone for nine days. *sigh* I don't  even know if I'll see him today. We will see.   I'm at work, so I'm done for now.
