I think that they both turned out pretty good. I'm hoping that my Olympics article will be a front page article. Here's hoping! I also went around after Newspaper camp selling ads and I actually sold an ad to this place called Combat Zone. The guy there had an ad already made up for me and everything. It was great! So I'm hoping that I have a year long customer with him. I also got a few good leads on the other places I visited that only buy around Christmas time or September. So that's why I'm excited to go out and sell more ads! Also, if anyone does actually read this and you know me personally then check this out:      GARAGE SALE ON SAT. AUGUST 7 @ THE OAKWOOD GLEN M.U.D. BUILDING 24 (RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE WATER TOWER) FROM 10 AM TO 3 PM!    PLEASE COME AND SUPPORT THE NEWSPAPER!      Oh and i also got a fortune cookie today at Chinese Wok that said:     If at first you do succeed, try not to look astonished.        So I thought that was cool especially after selling my first ad.
