The images took the entire side of the truck –on all sides and in tiny black print there was a web address for  urlLink The Center for Bio-Ethical Reform .  I nearly lost my lunch at the sight of this truck sitting in the parking lot of a restaurant, then I wanted to cry, third I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs at whom ever would be so deranged as to drive such a thing, let-alone park it in a place where children would see it.  Now I will tell you that I am not an advocate for Abortion, I believe that its wrong to take a life, especially a life that has not the ability to choose to be born in the first place and certainly doesn’t have the ability to choose death.  I believe in God and while I believe that a woman should have the right to choose everything else about herself, that is not one of them –no matter the circumstance.  There are other choices to be made, adoption for one.  Still that is just my opinion and not one that I try to force on anyone!  Okay, now back to the topic.  I endeavored to try to understand why such a thing would exist.  When I went to their website I only got angry.  A high and mighty organization who endeavors to tell others how to live and results to scare tactics.  Disgusted I spent many hours contemplating this organization’s purpose and what they must be thinking, I came up with only anger.  These groups give all Christians and Republicans a bad name.  Organizations like this one make us all look like crazed, picketing, take a stand for whatever is good today, type of people, and all in the name of God!    The lord provides us all with freewill from the moment of our birth, I only believe it’s a shame to waste it on this ignorance.  The lord is a forgiving, loving god and slinging brimstone at anyone YOU don’t like defies the entire purpose of faith in God.  Sometimes I think its not a wonder that the lord drowned everyone in the world once, and sometimes I believe that it’s a shame that Jesus choose to give his life for such ignorance.  I thank God for the sacrifice of his son, for without them I would never know forgiveness like I do now –even thought I feel unworthy of his sacrifice, I thank him none the less.   I only have one thing to say, “Love thy brother” and I do not consider this radical group loving!    ~Kristyn
