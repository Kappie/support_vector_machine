Chill out.  Graduate next year? Cool.  YEAH I ALMOST HAD IT. Actually, I noticed I missed 10:58 when I first posted it, so I came in, cut the text from the first one, deleted it, and made a new one. The school clock said 10:58, but Blogger said 10:59. Obviously, my frusteration.  So  that's  who they are. I was just curious. As for the Herd...hmm...I'll ask if I think of it.  Kenzie lost  Poor Bastard ...and all of her CDs for that matter. MANY TEARS ARE SHED. But that's ok. "Here at Johnny Rocket's we do service with a smile"...the funniest thing ever said by any man, I'll explain it later. We might go again this weekend, perhaps perhaps.  And there's the bell.  Good day all.
