Ceiling crumbles    With the touch of my fingers,    It falls dry and dusty.    Brushing past my skin Dampness    The floor beneath me,    Wet and soggy,    Saturated with unspeakable horrors. My pillow,    Sharply angled granite.  There’s a door I know, I just can’t find it.  A crack of light, Breaks into my prison, Biting into my skin.  A corner of a building, A screen for which shadows to play.  The branches of a tree,    Budding with spring.    Green with summer.    Empty with fall.    White with winter.  Through this crack,    My world.  Night falls… Darkness  Four walls,    I think. Ceiling crumbles     With the touch of my fingers. Dampness    The floor beneath me One brightly colored leaf, Escaped form that world into mine.
