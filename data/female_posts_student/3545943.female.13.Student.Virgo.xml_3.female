Reading material:  Nothing new. Greatest desire that cannot be fufilled:  Parents that I could talk to. Greatest frustration:  Me Inspiration:  Pain Plans for the future:  If I planned it out now, what would I do later? Focus in life:  Understanding Attitude toward the whole of human kind:  Pity Completely illogical desire:   For the world to lie to me To tell me I'm good For something. Wrap me in falsehoods So I can pretend For a moment Until I realise There's no ground beneath my feet. Thing that I wish I could sit down and do but feel incapable of doing:  dying, painlessly Physical condition:  Good enough Mental condition:  Near the breaking point Emotional condition:  Rotten
