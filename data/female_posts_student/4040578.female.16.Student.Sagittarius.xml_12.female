Well, we being cat lovers get a can of cat food and start meowing like kittens for it to come us. The poor thing came to us. Its front left paw looks broken. The kitten was hopping around everywhere. We took it into the cottage with some cat food and water. It's weird, the cat is so people friendly. It started purring. Well, since my brother is staying out in the cottage for awhile, we had to take it somewhere else. I could not allow that cat to not be in my possession with it being injured. So I offered to allow it to stay in my room. So here I have this little injured black kitten all curled up on my floor. My mom and I did manage to tape up its leg. But I have a feelin it will need to be amputated. The sex of the kitten is undetermined. I still don't even have a name for it. My dad suggested to call it "History"...haha, that's not funny. But yeah, any suggestions? I keep looking at it to see what names comes to mind, but I still see a blank. Anyway, I am just glad I could rescue it.    Moving on, today I woke up around 6:30am for my breakfast date with William which was supposed to be at 7. But the little meany showed up at 6:40. He brought me some breakfast which was delicious. So we sat and ate and then by 7:45 he had to leave to go to work. So yeah, that was thoughtful of him. Once he left I went back to sleep until 11. Then I just talked with my brother and sister for awhile. Then came 12:30 when I was supposed to be in the shower, but that is when my mom saw the kitten. I ended up taking care of the cat til 2:30 when I decided to get in the shower then. After I got cleaned up, my mom and I went over to Dollar General to get some gauze stuff for the kitten. Then we came back home and had dinner. After dinner, I sat around some more, took the trash out, and sat with the cat some more. Then around 7:30, my dad gave Leah and I money to go get him and my mom a milkshake. So when Leah and I left to go to Target we also stopped at Arby's to get some Jamocha shakes. Then I came home from that and baked cookies and watched Big Bro. Now here I sit. The kitten is still asleep. Aw, I love it already! But I shouldn't get too attached. Word has it, I might be going to the Fair tomorrow. If so, this would be the first time I have ever gone. Yay me! But yet, those plans could possibly change. Hmmm.      Ok, well I did something to my wrist and it hurts to seat here and type. I don't know if I slept funny last night or if he just hurts from beating up on people. But ouch, it's a killer. Might I also add, it is August and the temperatures are in the 40s. WOWZERS! I am loving it! Well, until next time, I am outtie!
