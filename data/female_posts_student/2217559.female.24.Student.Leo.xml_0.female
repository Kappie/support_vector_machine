I have had 5 heinekens and I am feeling all good at this point. Sometimes I think it is just easier to get out of things so i don't have to commit emotionally. I don't what the hell my problem is.  I just kind of freak when things get tough and feel the need to just run from it all.  I think Jason hit it on the nail today when he responded to my email about leaving on a cruiseship.  He said, "Why? Sounds to me like you are running from something."  And I thought to myself, maybe I am.  I ran from Houston to Nac-a-nowhere and then from there to Austin and now to Austin to somewhere out in the middle of the ocean.  Yet I do try and blame it on business- like the contacts i will meet or the moeny I will save to get Bella Rock and SLT off the ground.  Hmm. Who's reading this now? The thoughts roam through my mind like a television that won't turn off. Tomorrow night is Shane's party. We are supposed to go.
