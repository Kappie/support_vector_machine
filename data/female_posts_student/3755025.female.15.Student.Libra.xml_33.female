(amazingly) -went to the arts festival on the lakefront-which was awesome by the way -visit deranged family on South Hill-they should be on jerry Springer! -and last, bowling!-(lowest score buys lunch!)  and not to mention repeating conversations on how corrupt and evil my uncle is and how the whole family hates him...And amazingly-my dad actually and finally told me that he had been hiding his pot addiction--even the I already knew about it before he moved. Now he says hes clean and im hoping that he doesn't start up again--as for my cousin, I hope he can get his act together before his girlfriend wakes up and realizes that she's second compared to his addiction.  im still tryin to figure out a date for the party...cuz it has (once again) been cancelled cuz barely anyone can go--so now im just waiting for the warped tour, and then maybe after that ill find a nice day to camp and throw it then... i still might have a few friends over on the 13th just for fun tho... (whats the worst thing that could happen? ::wink::)  mood: mischievous (heh heh heh) music: A Perfect Circle- 'weak and powerless'
