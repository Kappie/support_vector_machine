It was hilarious because when Jazzy and I walked into the house, they were eyeing us.  We sat down to eat and lo and behold here they come.  It was funny cuz they start making small talk how old are you 17 and 14  oh ok we're 16 and 17.  The one guy who said he was 17 was lying cuz he looked grown as hell!!!  lmao.  But all in all, today was a good day too.
