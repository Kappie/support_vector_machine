Jealousy is so stupid, and yet, it gets everyone, even the best of people. You don't even know all the details, and you just jump to the conclusion that for some reason, she's taking him from you. But he's not even yours. And still you feel like he is yours. Duh, okay people are not property. To put it in a better way, you feel like she is taking his heart from you or maybe his love for you--even if it's a friendly love or more than that--or something along those lines. She's already closer to him in many ways, but you feel connected to him more deeply anyways. You fool yourself into believing he's yours, but he's not. The truth is that he's more hers than he'll ever be yours. You stare from afar, and yet, you're just too far, farther than you ever imagined.   Okay, enough of that for now. It's way too unrequited love-ish. Maybe I'm just tired--well no I am tired. Maybe the lack of sleep is getting to me or maybe I'm thinking honestly for once. Who knows?
