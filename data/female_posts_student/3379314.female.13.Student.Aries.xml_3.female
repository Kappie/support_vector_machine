But as I've grown their is atleast one thing that i have learned.My problems are only going to get harder. My biggest problem right now is well i don't really like the way i look. And thats not even really a problem...  Today I had a feildtrip and my mom was the chaperone. It was soooo boring it was baseball game and basically i hate baseball even more then i use to. My arms got seriosly sun burnt. they r like so really ugly!.
