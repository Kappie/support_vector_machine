Un-worried.       He shouldn't be worried. And neither should I. But I am, and will always be, eventually.       Today I don't feel so well. this morning... I must admit was... spectacular. but tonight. I want to feel arms around me. I want to feel protected from the shit of today.      And I know I can't have that.       And then... Erich was online. And it was neato-spectacular. the feelings I got when I saw his name were sweet.And I talked to him for all of-- what-- ten minutes? and he left. gone. As fast as he came in...       That's all I have.      Sage
