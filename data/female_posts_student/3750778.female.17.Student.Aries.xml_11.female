But I'm also just as calm as can be... pretty strange actually. Usually I get so excited before going somewhere that I get sick to my stomach and everything, but not this time. I don't know why, maybe because I know what to expect mostly. But on the other hand, I have greater expectations of what God is going to do! OOO I wish you could all come with us!!  Micah, Megan, Lisa, and I went and saw Sleepover tonight! It is so funny! We were the only ones in the theater so we were all loud and stuff. Afterwards Lisa's daddy took us to his printshop(I guess that's what you would call it..) and he made us new T-shirts for our trip! They are cute! We'll I better go, my momma said my online/phone curfew was 9 o'clock. So if she catches me(even though she's already in bed) I'm going to be in deep doodoo!   YAY FLORIDA TOMORROW!!! I'm gunna miss yall!!
