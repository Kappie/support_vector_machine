The only downside was the fact that my cousins wanted to get up before the crack of dawn on Friday morning to take advantage of the after-Thanksgiving-shopping marathons and super low prices. I stayed up until about 1:00am working, then went to bed. Unfortunately, I couldn't get to sleep, and at 5:15 the alarm went off. My cousin Brandi came upstairs with a migraine, and threw up several times. Poor baby. I truly can sympathize, because in high school I used to get migraines 3 to 4 times a week. Some of the worst pain I've ever experienced--the equivalent of what an ice pick through one side of the head must feel like. I've become nauseated with the pain before as well.  So...needless to say, I didn't get any sleep Thursday night. The whole thing messed up my sleep schedule, as I was planning on waking up early Friday morning and working. I still have so much to do: finish my thesis, write a 10-page paper for Spanish prose, study for my anthropology exam on Wednesday, and write a graduate school proposal statement. No clue how I'm going to get all that done by next week.   The house looks lovely~ Aunt Rite and my cousins and I decorated the tree and the rest of the house for Christmas. I love our Christmas tree--it's like 11 feet tall with hundreds of ornaments on it. This is most definitely my favorite time of the year.  Less than one week until I graduate! Weeee!!! (I have to take a final a week after I graduate, of course.)
