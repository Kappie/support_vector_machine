Theo: LOL, That is the third weirdest sentence I've ever read.  Another thought occured to me a few minutes ago as I was climbing the steps. If my dog, who was standing at the top, had decided to jump on me and push me down, I could have died...This why it is essential to prevent "man's best friend" from realizing he can get away with murder...
