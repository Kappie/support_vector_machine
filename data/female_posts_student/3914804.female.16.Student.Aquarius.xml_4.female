Having watched 2 dvds already today i am loath 2 watch another, so instead I am writing this while listening to my mother and brother play table tennis and make odd comments to one another.              Anyone seen Withnail and I? "The fuckers will rue the day!!" "I'm going to pull your head off... No, please don't pull my head off. I'm going to pull your head off, cos i don't like your head!"              If anyone reads this who HASN'T seen Withnail and I, they're going to think ... well... strange thoughts!!              Apparently it's a very cult film, and apparently people see if they can drink whatever Withnail and "I" drink throughout the film... As vast quantities of alcohol and paraffin are included, i would think that would kill them, but ya know, I'm open minded(ha)each 2 their own eh?!                Due to the hurtful insults regarding my colour scheme, I have revised it, and as I am currently writing in pale blue which I can't c on white bckground, i hope that i make no errors and also that this extreme sacrifice is duly appreciated! Heehee.              Always looks a bit moronic when people write heeeeeeeeheeee, which I FREQUENTLY do in online conversations and my blog, but one has 2 express laughter somehow!! and it's better than the inane repetition of the word "lol" which sends angry shivers down my spine...              My brother is driving me craaaaaaazy - and i was pretty mad 2 start off with...              Soon the grief that is packing will once again be upon me, and as I have often bored dom by telling him, I CANNOT PACK!!!!!!!!!!! For one night away from home I pack a week's worth, how much am I going to pack for a week?!?! Harder 2 pack for a friend's house when u will b going out, than 4 a holiday, as when u go out on holiday no1 u kno is ther! (OH apart from mum dad and siblings... but they don't count.)              West Wing, more people should be granted access to it. Now it is shown only on E4 and my parents won't get Sky cos my mum hates rupert murdoch...              The air is turned blue with cussing as Muffin bites Miles' toe... mwahahaha!              And again, as Miles loses 2 points in a row to mum...              Honestly, the influences that surround me, it's a wonder I turned out to be the miracle I did! heehee j/k!              Stand up comedy takes much bravery, and it's disillusioning when you find out the whole thing is not, in fact, improvised, but memorised :-( . Eddie Izzard and Robin Williams , also Ricky Gervais. Eddie Izzard's first girlfriend was the current girlfriend of my new English teacher'. Wow an incredible link 2 fame... It reminds me of Caroline,Cesca and Naomi's major thing for the great (yeah right) Justin Timberlake, so conventional! heehee.Every day Caroline would come in with a new "link" that somehow, eventually, linked her to Justin Timberlake. Usuallytheu went along these kind of lines: "Well,my sister's boyfriend's dad's borther's friend is a bodyguard of 50 Cent, who knew Jennifer Lopez, who's a pop diva like Britney, who dated Justin..." You get the picture!              Muffin having a crazy spell again, better go...............              over and out!
