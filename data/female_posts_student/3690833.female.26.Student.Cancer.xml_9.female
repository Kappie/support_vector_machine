This is why I am boring you all to tears on the computer, so I can put off studying.  right now the dog is barking incessantly at the movers next door.  right now I am considering a muzzle.  right now I am also doing laundry, such a multi tasker I am, laundry, contemplation of dog-icide, procrastination of math studying, typing, boring my friends...  right now I am cursing whoever made downloading photos so damn complicated.  right now I am wishing I would have paid more attention to those godawful computer classes they made us take in high school.  right now I am wondering who will read this crap.  right now I really don't care.  right now I am thinking how strange it is that I have two close friends at 721 iron st and they probably don't even know that they are there together.  right now I am looking at the clock thinking I have 3 hours left before I have to go to work  math and work. Ugh.  right now I gotta get a life
