Its based on the book   Macbeth   by William Shakespeare, but its set in the '70s and its hilarious, I defintely recommend it to anyone. Anyways, I've already seen it, we watched in it English class, so me, L, and G have seen it, and nobody else has, so we wanted to spread the humor. anyways, so it was me and B on the couch, and G showed up, so then it was me, B, and G sitting comfortably on the couch, but then LD showed up and we squeezed her on the couch too...we all got very close, but it wasnt really awkward because we had spent so much time together recently. anyways, it was really funny because another one of our friends likes G, and was there and was watching us and giving us dirty looks the whole time we were fidgeting around and laughing and stuff. And we were telling inside jokes because we had just watched   The Shining   last night, and we were making Tony jokes and saying "redrum redrum" in a freaky voice...yeah...nobody else got it. But, I hate to say it, but I actually liked sitting that close to G... I don't know if I'm falling for him again...maybe its that I've never really stopped liking him, I mean he was my first "serious" boyfriend, and that relationship didn't end well. But I already wrote about this, duh. But I don't know, it sorta feels like he's feeling the same way, sometimes by the way he looks at me...am I crazy? Probably. I don't know if I should tell anyone this. If I do tell anyone this, it has to be LD... she listens better than anyone else. Yeah and I also have a problem with LL, we didn't end well either, but that was my fault. It was stupid of me to try to have a relationship with another guy so soon after breaking it off with my long term bf M. I thought I could, I thought I really liked LL...guess not. But I told him why I was feeling this way, and he knows everything about me, I thought he would understand, but he didn't. He started acting like an ass, and he was really bitter about the whole situation, but I guess I would be too... and he still flirts with me because he still likes me but I don't know if I should talk to him or whatever. G knows that he still likes me, and feels bad for him, a) because my last bf used him to get to me, and b) because of me, because I sorta dumped him in a flash... and I feel bad, but I'm not gonna trade in my feelings for a guy anymore, I did that too much with M. I think I've really given up on guys, but deep down I want a relationship, a good, strong, healthy relationship, but sometimes I feel like I can't make the commitment. I don't want to be tied down, I don't want to cry over a guy again. M really put me in the gutter, even though I was the one who dumped him. I want to be held again, I want to be kissed again, but I also know I hardly have time for a relationship or the energy. Having a good relationship takes up sooo much time, time that I could be studying or riding my horse or running or working out or playing with my dog. And its senior year coming up, I can't make any more mistakes for school, I gotta kick ass... but we'll see what happens. Maybe it would be better if I had a boyfriend that was the same age as I am...but then what happens at the end of senior year? We both go off to college...long distance relationships are tough too, talking on the phone doesn't always do it, especially if you spent so much time together. And I know where I want to go, I'm not gonna change my plans for a guy. Yeah...ahh...I can't wait for college, so much more freedom, and I won't have to worry about parents not approving of dating or anything. But another year of prison, another year of torture, but another year of fun, laughter, friends, and good times, especially since we all have our licenses and cars...fun times will continue! thats all for tonight, will write when I have another craving to get my thoughts down online... Love, ME
