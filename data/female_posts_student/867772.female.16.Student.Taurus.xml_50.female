As you can probably tell, I'm bored as fuck right now. I just posted three times in like, five minutes. That has to be breaking some kind of I-have-no-life record. I actually think I've broken that record more than once. About a year and a half ago, I found out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie-pop. I think it was like, 365 to get to the actual tootsie-roll center, and 984 to get all the hard-candy shit off so all you have is a tootsie-roll on a now limp stick.  You know what cereal I haven't had in a long time? Cap'n Crunch. I love Cap'n Crunch. Or, at least, from what I remember, I  think  I love Cap'n Crunch. I remember they have (or had, for all I know) the peanut butter kind, and the kind with the "berries", and then they made the kind with the berries and the green things. I want some of those green things. Next time I'm this bored I might walk to the store and buy some. I'm too lazy right now.  I'll shut up and stop taking my boredom out on you.  Cap'n Crunch fucking rocks.
