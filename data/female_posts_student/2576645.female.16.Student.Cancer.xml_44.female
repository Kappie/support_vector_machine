Anyway, we got some frappacinos and just sat and talked for a while. Mostly about the catholic religion, its flaws, and so on. But what I really loved was just the freedom of hopping in a car and going some place just because I could (and the fact that Jill has a license). God, that just made me want to get my license so bad.  Geez this weather sucks. Its Memorial Day Weekend! Where are 'ya, sun?  I also got to see Shrek 2 last night. That is officially the best kid movie (...yup, I know you saw it coming...) EVER! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.  Song of the Day: 'Jackson Cannery'- Ben Folds Five
