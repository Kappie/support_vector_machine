I keep hearing about all these people who are killed over there, soldiers, civilians. I think it's just so stupid. I wish I could do something about it by voting, but there's just that minor inconvience that I'm only 15. 3 years to go.  well, I'm halfway done with driver's ed, thank god. I am way sick of getting up early for class. but at least it's not all summer.  my bridal shower for my sis went okay. everyone said it was great. I didn't think it was, but then again I'm really not into that type of party. I just would rather get some pizza and have my friends over. this type of party is just little tea sandwhiches, lemonade. ugh. but I love my sis.  to do: >buy ninja turtle pillowcases >learn sims object building >work in darkroom >work w/ savings >clean out car
