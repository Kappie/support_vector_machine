And so did my new computer, although I can't pick it up until tomorrow since it looked like rain and I didn't want to carry it all the way back to my apt. from the Union.  I'm still debating whether or not I should buy the iPod.  I think I should.  It'd be a good thing to have in the field.  Of course, it's another expensive toy that could get stolen.  Ah, the pros and cons.    Ugh.  When you spend large chunks of your day reading it makes for a mighty boring blog.  So it goes, I guess.  I STILL didn't have any mail today.  That's like three days without even getting junk mail!  What's up with that?  Maybe the postal service has blacklisted me for dissing them in my blog.  Hmm.    I love you US Postal Service!! I love you!  I want to have your babies!  Just deliver my mail already!!  Maybe that will work :)  Well.  Time to try to throw together something yummy for dinner.  And then read about classical Indian civilization...
