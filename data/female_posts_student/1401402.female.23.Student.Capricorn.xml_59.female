However, I seem to be inspired enough to blog about being uninspired at the moment... So once again I've reached one of the many confusing crossroads in my daily life... Where words don't.... Where I don't know the words to express the frustration of not understanding how I should feel... I like 0's and 1's... blacks and whites... They are the fuel I use to move forward with confidence... fractions and grays confuse and hinder me... my grays are always close to me though... As my journeys and experiences accumulate, I'm constantly cross-referencing with my grays to see if I've stumbled upon any answers unwittingly... What a feeling it is when it is revealed to my simple mind that something gray shouldn't be... It's so great to let that portion of me rest and experience a semblance of peace.   Oh, to feel hope in hopeless times. Nevermind the silver lining, cuz the clouds are fine. To breathe prayers that move the heavens or save hundreds from the flame, To know my place, to know my name. I never could be good enough to measure up. But You want to take me as a I come. You're the only one who can take me as I am.  I see I am not interesting but I like to write. I actually used to be very charming and witty and funny, and if you spend time with me, I might be that again, but on this blog I guess I'll just have to be mildly amusing and somewhat insightful yet confused... I'm cool with that I guess... but I'd like to be charming again one day...  Anyways… this is one exchange that I think You’ve Got Mail revolves around. Life doesn’t get interesting until you get personal. I think that’s why I like to memorize everyone’s talents or skills that not everyone knows about. I think that’s why I ask a million questions to total strangers. My insides yearn to get personal. I’m an only child people. I can have a shallow conversation with my shoes. I’m looking to get deep. I need to get deep to be of any real use to you. Don’t get me wrong, I can wink and smile and witty banter with the best. But if I can’t exchange with you ourselves, I’m just not being utilized properly.   My insides. How funny. It’s cool to see sentences that contain, “… my insides…” What I think is interesting about it is that “my insides” is often referred to in a manner which implies something like a genetic predisposition. “My insides yearn to get personal.” But why? Why do my insides yearn to get personal? I’m not sure why. It’s how I was made. It may be different than how you were made. But I tend to think that a large percentage of people’s insides yearn to get personal with other people’s insides.   Everyone has a sign on them that says, “I want to feel important.” My sign says, “I want you to feel important. Let’s find out how.”
