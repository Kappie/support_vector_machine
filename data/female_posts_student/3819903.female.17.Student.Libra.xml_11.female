I go from waking up at 2 one day, to waking up at 7:30 the next...thats a big jump!   So our four-some headed out on the 1st hole around 8:30, and we played at a pretty good pace. We ended up finishing right on schedule...11 o'clock. Pat and I tied with 49...it was a dismal 49! Wasn't a well deserved 49--I thought i played like shit, but thats just me! Joe showed off his new clubs (very nice actually), and was playing pretty well until the last couple holes. He finished with 71, and Nicole came in with 80. See, nicole really doesn't have that bad of a swing! Her back swing is really good, but when she has to make contact with the ball...its not always guaranteed! She would probably need like 3 lessons to get her hitting the ball hard, and straight...and longer than 50 yards! She has potential!   After our outing...Pat and I got some food, and Nicole went home to get ready for lunch with Amanda and her roommate. Joe kind of left in a huff, but we wont go there! So...I went home to get ready for the second part of my day...Rock Climbing! Yes!  Nicole and I decided yesterday, that we going to go rock climbing with Dan Wilkerson. Hmmm...yeah haven't done that in like 6 years! Adventure Rock! HAHA so we get there..and the first thing the guy asks is how old we were! Hmm..Nicole had that covered! I, on the other hand...am still 17! Damn them! So they said they needed a parent signature...so we decided to head over to Banting where my mom was watching my brothers game...but Nicole's brain clicked in and said,  "How Would They Know?!"  I thought that was the most genious thing she said all day! Wow...Nicole was living like a rebel...is she sick!? So I called up the mom, and asked if I could sign her name for her...so i didnt need to go out of my way! I did, then sat in the driveway for a while, and walked on in when Dan got there. They didn't suspect it one bit! Nice! Go Nicole! So it was off to use muscles that haven't been used in a while! Wow, didnt think i'd be that quick at getting up! It was really kind of hard after a while of holding on, but it was kind of nice...agreat work out! It's definitley is hard on the arms though! You need a lot of upper body strength!   So when we were done getting cramps in our hands and shoulders, we went to subway to get some chow! we were sooo hungry! Then we realized that we had to be at the bowling alley in 45 minutes! Lets see..I'm Broke, Tired out of mind, and am soo sweaty--Don't Think so!   So I went home, took a shower, found out if anyone was going anywhere, and plopped down on to the computer...then decided that I might as well chill at my humble abode for the night, and take a day off from the chaos. So I'm gonna watch Gothika with the Papa and Brother tonight...it shall be fun!
