I was watching it fly away from beneath my feet and was just about to crash when today intervened.  I did my history, my apes labs, called exploris, typed 4 pages of my english...all thats left is that damn color chart.  I hate being out of control and it always simply spirals into further decay.  Entropy is the worst law that ever existed...why can't things be propelled into order, not disorder?
