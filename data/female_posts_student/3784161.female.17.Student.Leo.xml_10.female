I bet it's been more than a month, maybe 2 since I've heard from him. I had just convinced myself that we'd finally grown apart and that somehow that was okay because we're both okay on our own now, and the important thing is we helped each other get to where we are now. But when his little messaging window popped up I knew I must've been smokin somethin cuz I still love him like mad and no matter how much our lives have changed or how little we see each other, he's still Derek, and the magnitude behind that title, as most of my oldest friends know, is immeasurable. And, he said "I love you" - 6 years ago he would've never done that. It's wild. But it meant that I'm not clinging hopelessly to a lost friendship. "Where've you been?" "away" - some things never change. He is the mystery of my life. Well, one of the many, one of the best. Maybe he'll come see me for my birthday. I wonder if he has his license yet......  okay so I'm in love with the world and i get to go to disney world and party while mandy and charlotte and ben serve as my servants, checking my email and calling me to lemme know about the stupid school stuff. I'm so happy. I want a trampoline. I wanna jump on it and yell and sing and then take a pillow and blanket out to it and sleep under the stars.  Happy 4th of July everyone.
