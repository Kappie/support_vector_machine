JuMP1115: supposed to know yellowfuzz13: supposed to's arent very forgiving JuMP1115: you worry way too much  even julie thinks so! i guess thats comforting...in a way.  but then again... you know what i realized today? i havent gotten any emails from her in a whole month. an entire month without emails. look what my life has become. and just out of curiosity, i counted the number of emails i got from her during july before freshman year. want to know how many? 148. 148 versus 0. huzzah for sophomore year.
