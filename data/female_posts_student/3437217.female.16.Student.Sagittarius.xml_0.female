But the cereal was good...come to think of it so was the biscuit.  I was trying to tidy my bedroom - the room is beyond belief, seriously. It's like becoming disgusting. I think that tomorrow I'll spend all day tidying it to make it spick and span!  I start my new job today. I am going to be one of those really annoying telephone folks, y'know who phone you up at dinner time, or just as That 70s show is starting and ask to speak to the home owner etc etc...yeah that's me now. But it's Â£5 an hour...and seeing as I'm such a capitalist I need money.   Prom is really really soon, I had like this plan. Before prom I was going to like work out...so I'd look good in my dress which is absolutely stunning, and I was gonna like get a tan, and do all this other stuff and now I'm just like 'meh'. I don't suppose it really matters, does it?! I mean knowing my year at school, we're just going to get really drunk and I'm certain we'll all have K.Od by around 2a.m. so nae danger, I guess.   I've kinda stopped thinking about Dan, I guess it really is over - I always thought we'd have a thing forever but perhaps not. Kirsty must be good to him! She's really very pretty so I guess he's like head over heels...not as I had hoped - on the rocks!  I convinced Amy to get a job at space kitchens too, so she's gonna start tonight too (I hope) which is good cause I was feeling a little scared...but Amy makes it all better! She broke up with Danny (my very good looking ex, who I introduced her to) yesterday and said that he took it hard so I may phone him later, I feel sorry for him...this keeps happening to him!  However for now, I have an untidy bedroom and a shower both calling out my name *sigh*
