But yeah - to the regular bloggie thingy!! Lol  Well tomorrow is the first day of school. Yay! Here is my schedule.. Spanish; Williams English; Dunn Contextual Algebra; Hedges Speech; Braswell Life Skills; Smith Wooo... Yeah - I only have one class with Ashley (R) which is Speech, fourth hour and I have fifth hour Life Skills, (or whatever you wanna call it) with Hannah.. That's it! Well, besdies Ashley (J) she hasn't gotten her schedule yet because she just got home from Florida late last night or early this morning.. Whoop De Freakin Doo, school is starting... I kinda' wanna go, like Hannah says the social part is fun, but the work is just 'okay'.. Lol. My friend Travis is in the hospital for an appendectomy (it means to get your appendix removed). Ashley (R) and Hannah went and saw him yesterday afternoon, I believe. I didn't even know 'till later last night. *sad* Poor Travis, he'll miss the first day of school. But, I hope he get's better. Anyways, enough sad - I don't wanna be sad anymore, I have been for a while... But I don't really want to get into that because it'll make me sad / upset again and... No. Tomorrow is school and I'll be dreadfully sad / boring the entire day.. No!!! Lol, sorry. Well, yeah.. On the subject of school (?) I got my clothes day before yesterday, not much but I'm getting more on Wednesday. Very nice. I got a shirt with Grumpy from Snow White and it says 'Get Lost' really big.. The shirt is black and the writing is white. I have another shirt, it's navy blue and it says 'How many licks DOES it take?' and it has that owl from the tootsie-pop commercial on it.. Very cool. I also got my high-top sneaker things. They're cool, they're black. On the subject of the color BLACK... What's wrong with it? It's a color, just like any other. Why do people have such a problem? I wear black, yes, not every single day but I wear it. Is there a problem? Please, comment your thoughts on that... I'd really like to know..  On my school binder thingy I put those stick on earrings (Lol.. Ima dork) lining the top of it. It's cool. Then I have my M's pencil bag.. I have a MM's folder, a M's note-taker book, two Harry Potter folders (they glow, I swear! They were calling to me.. "Lacey... Buy us! BUY US!" Lol) I got a baby stapler! Aw - so cute. I got some college ruled paper (I'm sure this is definitely what you wanna hear - my school supplies!) Um... Some mechanical pencils and some other stuff... I don't remember.. Don't bug me, okay?!?! Lol.  Okay, I wrote a lot today. I hope it made up for the time I was gone. Don't forget to post your comments about the whole black thing.. Thank you, and have an awesome day, homies! (lol) Toodles  Tata for now!
