Anyway, so let's see here. What can I talk about?   Hmmm...   Let's see...   Well, crap. Josh, you already know everything, and I don't really care if anyone else knows stuff. But I'll see what I can get out here.   Oh, I ordered something online the other day for the first time ever.  And then it came yesterday, and it was really exciting.  Ok, so I bought a Mr. Holland's Opus DVD, so I guess it's not something to be really excited about, but I love the movie, (I watched it twice yesterday) and the package had my name on it, so I was happy.    And... well, I don't know- I broke the ice, didn't I?  Someone else come up with something to say!  I'm boring yall with details of an online order, so somebody say something more interesting than that.  I promise it won't be too hard.    And Josh, I do know someone just like that.
