But I thought about it and I realized how much it would hurt to hit myself with a bat and so I decided to just cut the crap! How about that?  Is that ok?  ANYWAYS............  An interesting thought came to mind not too long ago.... read on!   (FYI: Its better to read this if you're picturing me as a redneck or just someone with a southern accent, I think that would make it more entertaining)  Not too long ago, I was drinkin' some of this here alcoohole-ic beverage while paintin' and sandin' in the garage when I noticed somethin' on my bottle of alcoohole.  I dunno if you folks ever drink **Mark's hard lemonade before.  But I shoooore did that night, cuz it gives you a nice little buzz after a bottle or two.  Anyhoo, there was this here message on it, you can call it a quote or whatever, for me it was just some writin' on a bottle. It said "If you're going to be original, you can count on being copied." Well hutttt damn! Ain't that just right on the bullseye there. (You can stop picturing me as a redneck or whatever). You'd think something like that would be coming out of some book of great quotes! Yet I found it really facinating that it came from a bottle of alcohol!! But isn't that true though?  That if you're going to be original, you'd just be copied by someone?  How many of us nowadays say or do something that we can really call OUR OWN THING? Not too many huh? How many of us put on clothing every day that is not inspired by someone or something? Do people who says they have their own style really do have their own style? Or are they just doing that so that they could say that their unique?  Is that true? Do they really have their own style? Or is it once again taken from an idea of someone outside of their knowledge? I'm not trying to say anything bad or judging people, so don't get all argumentative with me lol! It was just a thought! I do it myself, I can honestly say that I have no originality! If I analyze my whole life, I don't think I can recount a time when I didn't want to have something of another person or even be what someone is! If you tell me you've never.. you'll just be LYING to me and yourself!! Because we both know that that's bullshit! BTW, What does it even mean to be "ORIGINAL" or "UNIQUE" nowadays!????? Does it still have the same meaning from the dictionary when used to describe someone? Makes you wonder huh? Whoever said alcohol makes you stupid!!? LoL! It was just funny that something I read from an alcohol bottle would inspire such truth!   NOTE: ** Product name was changed due to legal reasons! LoL!
