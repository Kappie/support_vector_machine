A few people are talking about it in their blogs and I feel the need to give my own take on it.   Firstly I am so totally against suicide as an option for any sort of issue.  Maybe that seems simplistic, but I just think its the ultimate cop-out.  Like, dealing with your issues is just too much so you go and off yourself?  Okay.  Riiiiight.  Sorry, that just doesn't work for me.  Especially since he had a baby daughter.  What kind of shit is that?  How fucking selfish are you?!  How about DEALING with your problems?!  Getting help, maybe?  That shows one's strength in my eyes.  But maybe that's just me...  Then there's the drug addiction.  Some people say that if he weren't on drugs, he wouldn't be able to write like he did.  Oh, you mean like those drugged-out stream-of-consciousness lyrics?  Riiiight.  I dunno... I never quite understood why there was so much drug abuse amongst the grungies.  There is a whole album written in memory of the lead singer of Mother Love Bone who OD'ed (a fuckin' GREAT album by Temple of the Dog - members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam) and Layne Staley of Alice In Chains was found in a river: cause of death? OD.  Oh and then there was Shannon Hoon from Blind Melon.  OD.  And Kurt kills himself.  But he probably would have OD'ed eventually too.  I'm SORRY but he WOULD HAVE.  I mean, I had pain in my life too and sure I've done my share of chemical substances (not as much as some, but still) and I didn't go and start abusing HEROIN and whatnot!  There are SOOO many people out there that have been victims of abuse or have had a VERY hard life and they don't fall into that trap.  Then again, there are people with less problems who do.  What is it that makes people go that far?  But anyway, back to music.  I ain't gonna lie.  I liked hair bands at the time.  I didn't get into grunge until it was kinda popular.  Sue me.  I liked the whole "look at me, I'm prettier than you, (sometimes) wear more makeup than you, my hair is longer than yours and don't you think I'm SEXY?!" attitude that came with bands like Poison, Nelson, Bon Jovi, Tyketto (does anyone remember them besides me?!) and Slaughter (oh Mark...Mark, where for art thou Mark?!)  I was a groupie-without-the-sex even then.  My friends and I befriended a few local bands like Turi (a.k.a. Tom's River) and Finster Baby and felt sooo fuckin' special.  They used try out their new songs to me at 2am and I lived for it!  Sure the music was cheesy sometimes...SO?  But...okay, another confession I STILL listen to Turi on full blast...what-what?! ...I think the lead singer is a pool man now, tsk.  Well, a man's gotta make a living...  I totally agree that Grunge pushed the hair bands out and only the strong survived by cutting their hair and making music that people still enjoyed (i.e. Bon Jovi and Metallica) AND, like I said, I jumped on the grunge bandwagon too.  I realized that as cute as they were, the pop-metal-hair bands really didn't relate to me personally like grunge did.  There was a lot I was feeling that I couldn't express, so songs like Soundgarden's "Jesus Christ Pose", Pearl Jam's "Garden", and Alice in Chain's "Would" really moved me.  So I thank MTV for bringing it to the masses.  I would have never heard of them otherwise.  Okay, so I replaced a pin-up of Mark Slaughter with a huge poster of Chris Cornell...Yeah? AND?  He was a SERIOUS ARTIST, I felt his music, and alright, it just so happens that he's FINE AS ALL HELL!!  Grrrr...  But I digress... Now, don't get me wrong.  I liked Nirvana but a) I hardly ever understood the lyrics and b) I feel there were other bands that came out at the time that were not put on such a pedestal because their lead singer didn't kill himself.  I think the fact that Kurt was so destructive in so many ways in general and then eventually killed himself (in a very violent way, at that) made people remember him more than someone else that maybe, I dunno, died of natural causes or maybe didn't die at all...like Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam or Neil Young for cryin' out loud!  Is what is happening here the same old story?  You didn't care as much when they were around, but now that they're dead they were/are now Saintly in your eyes?  Go figure.
