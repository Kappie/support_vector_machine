How is it alright to unjustly send our young soldiers into war and for them to die fighting in that war, but not alright to kill an unborn fetus? How is it alright to kill a mentally retarded person who commits murder, but not alright to kill an unborn fetus? Isn't it an oxymoron to say you are "pro-life" and "pro-gun". The whole purpose of a gun is to kill, which, as I understand, would be the complete opposite of pro-life. Can you say "anti-life"! What amazes me even more is that all of this craziness is based on some crazy philosophical mumbojumbo. My stance on all the afore mentioned situations is that war should not be started unless there is credible evidence supporting it from people other than those wanting control of the country in question; I am completely pro-choice; I am anti-capital punishment for the reason that I beleive it is far worse of a punishment for someone to rot in prison for the rest of their life than for them to be put to death; and finally I am fully anti-gun. This whole thing is very flawed and I know that, it's just my opinion.      "The question is not whether we will die, but how we will live."   -Joan Borysenko
