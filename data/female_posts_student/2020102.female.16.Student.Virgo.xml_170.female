One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise." - F. Scott Fitzgerald  "Humor is just another defense against the universe." - Mel Brooks  "Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves." - Carl Jung  "Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten." - G.K. Chesterton
