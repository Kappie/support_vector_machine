It's all about John and Arlo, more so Arlo, because I know that John is joking and he's actutally a pretty caring person, Arlo on the other hand is an ASSHOLE. But today during lunch, since I sit with the theatre people, Arlo sits there and of course ever since he had to read my essay in english he's been giving me a hard time about my relationship. I understand that meeting on person on the net might not of been the smartest thing, but it wasn't like I was looking and going into chat rooms, it was an accident, not that I regret it, I'm just saying is all. But, when you go so low as to Arlo calling me stupid and pathetic. I know I shouldn't let this get to me, it didn't, but after things are said over and over, it just pisses me off. And the fact that he brings he other people in it, people I don't know really well who don't know anything about me. So it's really hard to defend myself. I mean Arlo sitting there talking to me about how pathetic I am and how sad he if for me, and also that I shouldn't trust anything because he's in college and you know we're like miles apart so yeah. And plus that it isn't even a real relationship since we've been going out for 7 months and we've been together 4 days. Ok, he barely knows me and my life, and he doesn't know my boyfriend so he shouldn't even have an opinon. And it just upsets me because he thinks he's so right and he's not. I trust David so much and he's the best guy in the world and I love him so much, there's not a doubt in my mind that he would ever do anything that Arlo is insintuating. I just want Arlo to shut up!! And stop freaking putting me down, it's my LIFE, I live it how I want to, so why should anything matter to him? He's probably just jealous because no one likes him because he's a stupid bastard, asshole, jerk, etc.  BTW, after going thorugh my past blog entries and realizing how gay they are, I'm going to make Ritika's dream come true and just silt my wrists and die.    my God my tourniquet return to me salvation
