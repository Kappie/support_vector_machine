Now, to celebrate I'm drunk (Liz, I'm totally thinking of you--we need to repeat this joy after Resendez. Fun, fun, fun!). We went to Ben 'n' Nick's with Dave and Alexa and had amazingly intelligent discussion about the increasing conglomeration of our world. Now I'm having an gin martini with Jerm's new expensive gin. Yum. I'm drunk and done with papers. It's totally the way life should be always. Next step: announcements! I have to get those out this week.
