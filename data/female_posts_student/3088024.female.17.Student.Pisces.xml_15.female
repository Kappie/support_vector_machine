Amount of sunlight, temperature, wind chill, heat index, how the classes before went, what we are playing, and the other people on my team are just a few.  Today started out alright, drifted up, came down, shot skyward, and plummeted back down again.  I guess I just don't understand people.  People don't understand me though so I guess the feeling is mutual.  Speaking of being misunderstood, I am sick of people saying "You just don't understand" or "It doesn't matter what I look like.  It's what on the inside that counts."  I do understand. You are shallow.  What is on the outside does mater.  Generally, it reflects the inside.  You are probably not the exception.  Whoah!  That was a little off the beaten path. Where was I?  Oh right!  I just don't understand people.  I am wicked competitive.  I HATE losing!  I used to be the worst loser ever.  Then in second grade, I grew up.  Hasn't happened yet in my gym class.  I was a fairly poor winner too until probably ninth grade.  I have mostly grew out of that though.  Anyways, PE can be fun.  People get way too aggressive.  I mean "play hard"!  Hoo-rah!  Inside of the rules though.  Punching the ground, flipping benches, and throwing students generally are not in the rules.  I am 99%  sure that putting up your middle finger when the teacher turns his back is not in the rules.  Swearing probably goes right along with that but that is more widespread than just PE.  And then there is the making fun of people.  I find it comical when a un-named 400 pound sophmore throws a temper tantrum and hits stuff and swears and lays on the ground holding himself and over-exagerates his injuries.  I am sorry but I really want to inflict actual pain on the pansy when he does that.  Not trying to get pity, I would like to mention that I however ripped through three layers of clothing and my knees, tore open my elbow, received a huge gash to my lower back, and scraped my palms today.  I did not lay on the ground and try to get the gym class to surround me and ask if I was ok.  I got up...then walked over to the side and quietly sat down because my knee hurt.  I feel bad for the seniors.  Sure they say absolutely idiotic stuff but they deal with a lot of unwarranted aggression.  The sophmores, who in general are...the coolest kids I know *cough**nose grows*, give the seniors alot of verbal and physical abuse.  The seniors for the most part don't have much to say back.  I admire the amount of verbal crap they take.  I see them tense up, and then let it roll off.  Not too many people do that today.  I mean after so much, problems escalate but hey what can you do?  BTW me falling I know that must sound funny because it also involves me being "active".  Here is the deal yo.  I was bored in gym.  I didn't want to participate because I have no skill and can't outrun your grandmother.  Yes I meant the one with the walker.  So I just kept walking and then Mr.Doan would walk up and tag me and I would smile and walk back and tap the dumpster and then I would walk back and do it again.  And again.  And again.  Well then something unexpected happened.  I walked through and picked up a cone.  Then I took off as fast as I could.  Again, this is not to fast.  Well I am running and running, trying to get back to the dumpster as fast as I could and I am looking backward to see if I am about to be tagged.  Sidenote:  Me running is dangerous.  Me walking and looking backward is dangerous.  Me running and looking back is a volatile mix.  On the my erratic journey across the blacktop, SO CLOSE TO THE DUMPSTER, my feet had a little disagreement about something(I couldn't hear too well cuz my ears are so far away and I didn't want to stop and ask at the time), and then the blacktop and I had some one-on-one time.  I ripped through my second favorite pair of pants.  No not the gym pants.  I was wearing these awesome pajamas under my pants as I always do and now I have holes in my knees and this wonderful spot where the blood dried.  mmm...That was a joy to pull from my leg.  Then I did my homework.  Mr.Gomez I put my heart into that paper.  Actually, just some blood from my wrist.  It was an awkward place for a band-aid so I just decided to bleed on the paper.  Not too much.  Just enough to remember me by.  I got the package in the mail.  It said "STRAIGHT TALK" on the front in cool letters on the front and my first thought was "I don't remember joining any supremacy groups."  As it turns out, it was just a little dvd on BJU and "the facts" about campus life.  funny stuff...
