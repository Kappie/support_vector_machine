I got called in and they told me I'd be cleaning the front entrance way and that I could wear street clothes, and that it's not that bad at all. Yea, I go in and the manager tells me what I have to do...I was thinking, "Oh my freakin' God!" I had to scrub everything--the walls and all these little cracks filled with dust and dirt piles. Then, I had to take a whole row of carts and move them so I could wipe off all the dead flies and bugs on the ledge by the window. Then, I had to take the motorized carts back into the shower room in the back (which was embarrassing to drive in the store) and wash them off. I started to get my pants wet when I went into the shower room so I pulled them up, and I looked like such a dork! (many of my co-workers saw me too). Then, I cleaned the security things in the doorway that beep if you steal something. All this in 4 hours. They also told me I had to get onto a ladder to clean the top part of the walls, but it was already 8:00 so I kept that for last and didn't have to do that. But, it was not fun at all. I like bagging groceries MUCH BETTER!
