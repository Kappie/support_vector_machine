I am enjoying reading and posting on the  urlLink www.AbleMuse.com/erato  web site...have to post at least 15 comments/critiques before you can subject your own work to others for workshopping. I am finding it a fascinating way to read and learn as well as to begin to realize some of the biases evident in some of the comments...which in term alerts me to the fact that there are a variety of views amongst participants and do as I think best with whatever is offered, vs. being squelched by some less than enthusiastic comments... take what works for me.  Alicia shows up on the AbleMuse site from time to time and emailed that she was glad I had joined it.  I am reading Susan's book (bought through Powells.com) Athena's Disguises; Mentors in Everyday Life. I recommend it and it's a quick read if you don't want to savor it...I find that I am savoring it in pieces. Thank you Susan!  BTW I am continuing to walk, having gotten in condition on Spetses and tagging along in Andrew's lead around Athens  Delphi. I walk to some destination where I can sit down and write or read and then trek home again...fun and it's keeping me writing as well as moving.  Keep adding notes...and the new voice piece that Lisa discovered is a great idea.  Ever, Eileen
