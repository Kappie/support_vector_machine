Nettles, or grass burrs, or other sticky things that attack shoelaces and bare toes while exploring the outdoors mean that you're going to be a hot item â€” for several guys. At once. All the boys will be demanding your attention, and they'll all seem like great options. The jock, the loner, the bad boy, and the sweetheart will all want a little piece of your time. You won't know what to do. Your girlfriends won't know what to tell you. You'll have to go it alone and weigh everybody equally. Your judgment will prevail, however, and you'll be thrilled with the one you finally choose.   shocks... hot item daw oh?! yah ryt!!   masaya ko ngaun.. aS in!! i dont know.. i just feel that everything went right for me today..  i had the continuation of my exam for trinity observer.. and i met this really cool guy.. his name is gerard, the managing editor! he's a 3rd yr bs bio student.. ambait nya.. kc kahit na nsa editorial board na xa parang wala syang kaere-ere!! ang daldal nga nya eh kahit na nagrereview sya.. tapos pag nakaside-view para syang si piolo.. he even gave me tips.. nakaka-entertain sya kahit na naiwan na kming dlawa dun sa room.. pati ung moderator na-meet ko na rin.. how i wisah makapasok talaga ko sa t.o.!!
