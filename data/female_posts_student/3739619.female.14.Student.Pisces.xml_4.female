I wear goggles at the pool so when I'm floating on my back in the water, I get a tan everywhere except for around my eyes! And it looks  really  freaky. We had to buy some sunless tanning stuff to put around my face. Well, anywho, ttyl. Byezo!  UPDATE: Well, turns out 10 minutes after we got there someone barfed in the pool. Luckily, I wasn't in the pool when they did. I had just gotten out to go get some water gear from my dad. But they said it would take 30 minutes for it to clear up and then when the 30 minutes were over they were going to have a 10 minute break so I went to get on the slide and the line stretched out down the stairs and onto the sidewalk. Finally, after waiting in line for 5 minutes, I got to slide  ONCE  and I was like, "Jack this, I'm goin' home." So I got back at 2:20 and started reading my magazine that came in the mail.
