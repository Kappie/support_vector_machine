It's fun to read some of the few interesting blogs I've seen. I just need to remember to fill this thing up with inside jokes and stupid stuff like that. Nobody cares 'bout that kind of info. 2. I need to keep a journal of some sort. If only to be able to read back over previous emotions and moodswings..in any case, if I stick with this, it'll hopefully help me get a better control over myself. 3. It's only my second day out of school and I'm already incredibly bored. Sooo..why not start a blog?  Listing stuff always makes me feel better. ^_^ I'm one of those people that organizing and cleaning helps produce endorphins just like exercising and that sort of stuff does.   I wonder who made up the word endorphin. That's just a really weird word. Wierd. Weird. Ok yeah.  Anyway.  To those of you who know me...some of these posts will make more sense than to random people just looking for time to waste by reading a stranger's blog. But...I don't know if I'm going to even give out this link to my friends. And I have no idea if this will be something worthwhile to people that don't know me. enh.  I guess this is good enough for a first post. I'll probably write more later, considering there's nothing else to do and I'm already feeling bored again, just by the fact that I'm ending this post..oy..
