But that's not what I want to talk about.  I have been thinking about butterflies, why nice girls like mean boys, why this is an awesome week, yet bittersweet (hence, the title), and where these outlandish rumors are coming from! First things first - my awesome yet bittersweet week.  If it weren't for the butterflies (see paragraph below - only Shaheen and Kortny truly know what butterflies are...don't even try to make sense of that), the Gill moving (see last entry...happy and sad tears), and the rumors (see paragraph below butterflies), this would be the BEST week of my life.  This is definitely in the top five though.  First, on Wednesday, I got my dream job as managing editor for newspaper.  I was actually looking at the chain of rule, and I preside over one of my best friends.  How weird is that?  It's like bein friends w/ ur employees.  But I do get to "supervise" section leaders (oh yeah, if u kno who the section leaders are for newspaper, you definitely know why I'm happy about this authority).  But enough about newspaper...u kno I wonder if Joe saw what I said last night, cause I might have given him inspiration.  Plus, I take the SATs on Saturday (the sooner u take em, the sooner u find out which colleges u have a chance w/), and then my church picnic's on Sunday, the 25th anniversary.  Yay! Anyway, then today I found out that I got inducted into NHS!!!!!!!  That's like my high school goal.  As Jasmine D. says, "that's kinda sad."  Most ppl want to get laid in high school, but I want to get into NHS.  At least my goal betters humanity, cause I'll be able to volunteer my services, and raise the collective GPA of the people I tutor.  I don't really understand the admissions process, cause some people who really deserved to get in (ZG, CB) didn't, and some people who really shouldn't have got in did.  But such is life. Wow, did u kno that prom's only nine days away, and after-prom's only ten?  I can't wait till we get to decorate for Prom...I've watched Las Vegas, the OC (they went to Vegas), and Will and Grace (Karen's wedding is in Vegas) to gather inspiration.  It's gonna be soooo much fun!  Even with all the silly rumors about reputed prom dates, I'm still looking forward to it, even though I'm NOT GOING (see  that  Ellen B. and Kristin C.).   What do you think of butterflies?  Do you think they mean anything?  There's two theories on butterflies out there, one from Shaheen, and one from Emily T. ...since they both gross me out, especially Emily's, just IM me if u want to know (TDMonMon875)...well now i guess i have to alter my profile ;) .  As Forrest Gump says (which I watched in 3rd period, and is one of the best movies of all time), "that's all I have to say about that." Ok, theres definitely someone out there that I pissed off.  Was it something I said?  At any rate, now the rumors say me and Alex are going on a SECOND date, which AGAIN IS NOT TRUE AT ALL!!!  I have three points on why it possibly cannot be true: (1). He has a girlfriend...so that fact alone eliminates that possibility, and I'm not some low ho (haha that rhymes) that does that kind of thing...I think couples, especially those types that hold hands and kiss, not make out, at classroom doors, and hug in the hallways, and shout I love you and don't care who hears them, are so cute (I have no clue if they're like that, I'm just saying that I think couples are adorable, as long as they don't show their love in a way that makes me wish I hadn't eaten anything that day); (2). I haven't seen a movie since February, cause nothing good has been out...u can ask one of three people that went with me if u don't believe me...I do want to go see Mean Girls, Troy, 13 Going on 30, Envy, and Godsend, so I prolly will be at the movies a lot in the future, but not with him; and (3). Other than a few things that have come up in "table chats" from first grade, which sooo don't count, plus of course kissing my family goodbye and goodnight, I've never had a serious, knock-you-off-your-feet kiss, and I certainly wouldn't waste it on someone I don't even like (right DKL, KDQ, ALB, ANB, JAEM, XO, YT, SA, BB, all the chem girls and all the other people who know why exactly I'm snickering...don't worry, I'm being totally honest about this, really I am). U kno, while I was doin my pool laps at the Y (which is one of the most refreshing parts of my day...you should try it), I was thinking, why do nice girls go for mean guys?  I can think of two such girls off the top of my head, and could prolly come up w/ a lot more.  I don't understand it.  If everyone says ur bf's am (insert mean word here that I can't say cause I mentioned church in this entry and I can't say Jesus Christ and the word I'm thinking of in the same entry), why wouldn't u believe them?  I would definitely take my friends' and family's word over a bf neday.  Then again, I've never been in a really really serious relationship, so what do I know.  These girls are sooo pretty too, so that rules out the old he-asked-me-and-I'm-never-gonna-get-anything-better-so-I-might-as-well-settle-for-what-I-can-get excuse, which is the longest hyphenated statement (random fact: the longest word is 1,913 letters...it's the name of a chemical posted in the Davis's room).   Well I'm getting tired and I can't wait for Math Analysis to see who got in in that class.  Later.
