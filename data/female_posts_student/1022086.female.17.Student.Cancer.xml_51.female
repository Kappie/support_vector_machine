She and Shah are still in the process of getting along.   Calculus exam today may have slightly kicked my butt. I wanted to kick myself after turning it in and realizing that I had made a very dumb integration mistake. Ugh.   Festival-- kinda sucked. Got in a huge fight with mom that day. Hasn't mentioned anything about it, thank God.  Went as class B (what the fry?) and made all 1's but a 2 in performance from one judge. While I thought we sounded like fishstix on the first piece and deserved a two there, the second piece was very nice. However, on the first piece, he gave us a two for the wrong reasons. All that we did well on, he said we did badly on, and vice-versa. Ehh... Most choirs' sopranos were uber-sharp. Good alto everywhere.   Kudos to NGHS's men. Nice performance. Oh, and I want someone to teach me that "Vive l'Amour/ Vive la Companie" song. It's been stuck in my head for a while, and it's awesome.    History exam tomorrow. Not going to make a high grade in the class for the quarter although it's supposedly my easiest. Worried about exam. Have yet to start studying. I hate history and having a crappy memory.   Forgot to ask B a tenth time for choir makeup work. Poo. Won't have a 100 in choir, and it's not even my fault. Rrr.   Did I mention that mom is indirectly evil these days?   Yeah.  Ok. Time to go study history, though I dun wanna.    Moo.   "Vive L'Amour" by somebody    Let every good fellow now join in our song, Vive la compagnie!  Success to each other, and pass it along, Vive la compagnie!  Chorus: Vive la, vive la, Vive l'amour. Vive la, vive la, Vive l'amour. Vive l'amour, vive l'amour, Vive la compagnie!!  A friend on your left, and a friend on your right, Vive la compagnie! In love and good fellowship, let us unite, Vive la compagnie!  Repeat chorus  Now wider and wider, our circle expands, Vive la compagnie!  We'll sing to our comrades, in far away lands Vive la compagnie!   Repeat chorus  With friends all around us, we'll sing out our song Vive la compagnie!  We'll banish our troubles, it won't take us long Vive la compagnie!   Repeat chorus  Should time or occassion, compel us to part Vive la compagnie!  These days shall forever, enliven our heart Vive la compagnie!   Repeat chorus    ---Although I'm pretty sure that NGHS's men sang a different arrangement.
