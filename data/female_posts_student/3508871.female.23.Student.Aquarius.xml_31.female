I would like to say this route was a tonne of fun. The first half of the route was pretty easy, started out with large hand holds, towards the middle part of the route it narrows down to really small foot holds and crimpy finger holds. Challenging and a tat bit scary with those crimps. But I FINISHED IT! Yeah baby!  So take a look at this route again: urlLink The Outsider
