So, thanks for making me feel better, guys, and taking my mind off things.  You know who you are.  Speaking of, it seems permissble in the North to refer to both genders with the term "guys."  But it is not so in the South.  I guess it's just a language thing, as most people down there say "ya'll."  But when I used to say "guys" referring to my friends both of the male and female persuasion, someone would invariably correct me, saying:  "I'm not a guy; I'm a girl."  On days when I miss the South, I try to remember things like this, just to keep it all in perspective.  I still miss it, but my nostalgia becomes tempered with reality.  Sorry for the digression, but such is the way my mind works.  Speaking of work, back to it I go.
