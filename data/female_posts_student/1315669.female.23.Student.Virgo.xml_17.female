Maybe it's because I'm afraid of what will eventually surface in my dreams when I fall deep into slumber land. The musik of Tracy in The Room is blaring into my ears as I'm typing this. Seriously, maybe it's a tad inappropriate to talk about world events now... but seriously, as the increment in years progress in my age, I can't help but feel that life is begining to feel like a big game that just has too much material stakes. The moral of the story and the gist to the game is just that we have to start coming to terms with the fact inside that, there will always be disputes and there will always be things that left us unable to extricate ourselves from situations that even our cerebelum cant handle. Emotions will always overwhelm one at any point in time. The strongest man will always falter at his weakest point and no matter how beautiful a flower is, it will wither and fade in time. Nothing is permanent in this world eh? Change is the only constant thing in life and stubborn as humans are programmed..it seemed the fact that our genes are the only source of sadism in us. Oh well...i'm getting a tad incoherent again. I shall attempt to head back to slumberland and negotiate with zhou gong. Bless all people who are in sleepy land.. I wish sweet dreams for all of you. Buy a dream catcher if u can...=]
