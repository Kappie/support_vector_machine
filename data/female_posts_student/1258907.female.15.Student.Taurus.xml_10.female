Would I use a blade? Would I use a knife? Would I ignore the voices? Or would I take my life?  Could I cut my wrist? Or hang myself with some rope? Could I just not listen? Or could I cut my throat?  I have the tools to do this, The question is will I succeed? Will I end up living? Or move to something in-between?  Voices, Voices, running in my head I think I'm gonna' take care of them, I'll make them wish they were dead!
