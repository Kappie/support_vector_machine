Anyway, as you all probably (don't) know: I'm always pondering what the hell I want to do with my life. ...And as I was gazing at the moon, I realized that I think I would love to be an astronomer. I mean, how many other people do I know that can spend hours upon hours looking at the night sky, and, when not outside at night, spend hours looking at pictures of space and reading just about anything related to space.  ...But then again, I also don't personally know anyone who has an appreciation for art such as I have... :/ So, I have narrowed my future professions down to either a photographer/photojournalist or an astronomer.  Wheee!  ..Oh, another advantage to being an astronomer: A lot of work at night. :) Fits me perfectly, no? ..But a disadvantage to my being an astronomer: I hate physics. I mean, it's not bad, but I think Fleming ruined it for me because my widdle brain couldn't handle all those formulas he threw at us at once. Bah. ....I shall overcome! (my dislike of physics).. I mean, you have to admit. Physics is pretty neat.   ...And just for the record, "Josie" is one of my most favorite songs. Yay.  ...Also for the record,  urlLink this site  rocks my socks. (Mind you, plenty of other great sites do as well... Mokey. Mokey.)
