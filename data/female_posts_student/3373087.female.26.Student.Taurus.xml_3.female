No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."  Why do I run this race?  Why do I work so hard?  Is it to "get a crown that will not last", or to "get a crown that will last forever"?  This is a good reminder to me that my body is expendable for Christ.  I've grown so comfortable with getting whatever I want, whenever I want it.  There's no doubt that I've lived a privileged life, which is a gift from God.  Do I truely know what it means to "beat my body and make it my slave" for the sake of Christ?  It seems like what Paul is talking about in these verses is having a sense of PURPOSE to all of hard work.  Yes, I could stay up long hours, skip meals, and turn down invitations to have fun, but this is all in the name of vet school.  This isn't necessarily bad because this is where God wants me to be, but once again, I need to have the mindset of using this position to honor God. My PURPOSE for being in vet school is to love others and to worship God in all that I do.     Lord, thank you for reminding me that this body that I've carried around for 26 years is  still  yours. I've done so much backsliding and I've forgotten so many of the times that you've been faithful to me. Despite my unfaithfulness, I am still your child, and you still desire to call me your own. Use my body, Lord, while I still have time, to do your work on this earth.  There is nothing I would rather do than to spend my days worshipping you.  All the meaningless little tasks I do don't satisfy me like as much as doing your work.  Lord, what can I do with my hands, my mouth, my legs to worship you?  What work do you have for me and where do you want me to go?  If loving your people means inconveniencing myself, losing sleep when a friend needs someone to talk to, or putting aside something "fun" for the sake of caring for someone else, then let it be. Let the work of my hands serve not to bring attention to myself (which is very tempting for me) but to point the way to you.  As the song goes, "Take my life and let it be, consecrated Lord to Thee.  Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of Thy love, at the impulse of Thy love."  Amen.
