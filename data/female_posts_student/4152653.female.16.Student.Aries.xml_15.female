"damn the man! down with the system!" does he know that hot topic's in the MALL? if he spent more time developing his personality he wouldn't have to shop for one around the corner from build-a-bear.      he's lost. with such a strong appearance his inside and outside are totally seperate...it's like he's got two lives. does he need these accessories to make up for something he feels he's lacking? he uses hair product and chains and black nail polish to define himself as an individual, but if he took it all off he'd see that his mind and personality are powerful enough to set him apart.      diversity is what makes life beautiful, but relying on objects to make you stand out is weak. to be a real rebel, try letting go.
