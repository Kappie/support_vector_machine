Let's face it, you run out of things to do after a while. Whatevr, the parts of school I was at today sucked. Enough said.  Then to add to be tired, cranky, and overall sick of school- I had to go to the damn math meet. The bus ride there was really annoying. Basically I got to sit there and listen to cj bitch about his spanish homework while daniel and james try to fuck katie fletcher. The meet itself wasn't bad- infact the people at my table were pretty cool. St. Albans guys... hahaha. You get it. Blah Blah Blah... then we had to get back on the bus.   This guy is being weird... if you wanna talk to a child rapist- here's one for you.  WDJ18 [5:48 PM]:  my name will  LuckyG1568 [5:49 PM]:  cool- a.s.l?
