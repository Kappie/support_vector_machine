On the Lector front I think we've given the bad doctor more than his due, so let me wrap up by saying I believe it's Lectors extrodinary intellect combined with his unrivaled evil that makes him a great villain.  As for your argument about  Clockwork Orange  I confess I've never seen it (I'm nearly allergic to Kubrick), but in the clips I've seen on t.v. Alex strikes me more crazy than insane.  We can talk about  The Matrix  until we're blue in the face but bottom line you see three movies, I see three parts of a whole.  I have to admit I'm a little surprised you didn't have more to say about my  Gladiator  rebuff.  I guess I thought a Roman royal being compared to a poor little rich kid (Paris Hilton in a toga)was a bigger dig than it apparently is.  That said my biggest problem with  Gladiator  is how the character hides behind his power.  He's afraid of Maximus and a great villain can never fear his adversary.  I really like your closing question, it's a great way to wrap our first discussion.  I haven't had a lot of time to formulate my answer, but off the top of my head Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro in  Heat  (a moody film unfairly overlooked) and Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey in  Seven  come to mind.  I particularly loved Freeman glancing at Doe in the rearview mirror.  I give you the last word and after you post I will pose our second question.
