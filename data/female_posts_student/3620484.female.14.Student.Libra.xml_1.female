Nights Song   Hold me ‘til the sun goes down ‘Til velvt blanket wraps us round  Hold me ‘til the its all gone ‘way “Til the world ahs closed on mans last day  Hold me ‘till the fires dim ‘Til earth and sky have silenced Him  I see not cruelty I feel not pain But with every shout I taste the rain  With battered wings And broken voice With every sob Of poor man’s choice  Hold me please Because it’s wrong To hum the words Of night’s sad song   Alone.
