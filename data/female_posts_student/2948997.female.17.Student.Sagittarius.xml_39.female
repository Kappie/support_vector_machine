Plus I miss writing in a journal and it's so much easier just to write on here instead of a real paper and pencil.   Theres a lot been going on as of lately and for someone whos not used to being treated with kindness...its been an interesting haul. A good one...but an interesting haul that I feel extremely happy to be hauling and that was an excess amount of the word haul used in the sentence.        I look at this situation and wow, sometimes I wonder why its me in this because there are many days where I don't think I deserve something like this. I remember its always "Kate have more self-confidence" but thats really not the issue here. I feel like I'm less than what is expected of me, like I get frustrated when I can't do stupid things such as playing idotic boardgames, or banter cleverly in a discussion.  Rather  in those situations, I run from my thoughts and try to find something else to do where I can feel like theres something left for me.        There are more than a few days where I look in the mirror and wonder how one can see beauty where I see nothing but a big black void of nothingness. I don't think that I'm ugly, but Istill question how someone can look at someone and find something. I guess its hard for me to see as I am so critical on myself.        Because of recent events that have happened, I was slightly mifted regarding the reactions of certain people but you know what... tomorrow that doesn't matter. Dana gave me an example: Would you rather have your best friend die, or have something more insignificant happen when you feel is a big deal? Kate: I would rather keep my best friend alive. These events that seem so important to us on a daily basis are really not as important as they may seem for the moment.Life is not a drama, thats why we have television and soap operas to supplyus our own sick need to watch others lives. Life is simply existance. You must adapt to your situation to live. I think that the biggest change for me that has come out of alot of events is the fact that life is not that complicated. The world is your playground and its you who gets yourself the positives or the negatives. It's the choices you make which ultimaley convey the reality that exists around yourself. I think that I'm getting better at taking these shots and letting them roll off my back. I don't need to fret and worry.        What is more important? Your happiness or your destruction to allow someone else to achieve their happiness??    What do you do? I'd like to think that I didn't ignore people and not be straight up and honest because I think that I remained quiet and kept everything inside without saying anything. I think that my silence was mistaken as a cheap shot. That frustrated me. I ran a google.ca search regarding ethnics....http://www.marychen.com/girlcode.html and my thoughts: this is bullshit. Bullshit.        You know what. You have to be happy and thats about it. Happiness is not a fish you can catch. There are a couple things you need.        Cabinet retreat was a good time this weekend (july 23-25) and it made me happy to spend time with Caroline and Britt. I think after these things always there this want for session to happen....but then time goes on and then we're caught in the snow and we're eating at the old spagetti factory. Publications will rock!        Anyways enough thinking.
