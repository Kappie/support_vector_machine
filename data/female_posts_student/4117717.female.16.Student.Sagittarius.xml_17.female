Now, this store is very...not-me. Since you know, I buy most of my clothes at Target and here I am looking in Banana Republic, so it's quite a risk for me. The first thing I think is..."I wonder if they ever considered using monkeys in their advertisments." I slowly glide through with that oh so delicate walk I have and almost knock into a saleslady. "Oh excuse me, I'm sorry..." I say without trying to make eye contact cause who knows what kind of things goes on in here. "No problem, can I help you?" she says. I look at her. She obviously looks better then me. She actually went through the whole hair and makeup process today. She was wearing nice pants, that were clean, unlike my scruffy looking jeans, and a nice white shirt. Yeah I have my overly large sweatshirt and a grey shirt underneath with a spot on it. I knew I did not belong here. "No thanks." I walk away. I walk over to the pants area...and you know...look at the pants. And they are in colors like that I would never even see in my worst nightmares. Like...peach colored pants! What are wrong with these people? Do we really need peach colored pants in this world? I glance around..."Oh these are cute pants!"...Someone is actually holding up the peach colored pants. Two preppy girls. Who also obviosuly spend quite a lot of time in front of the mirror. Yeah I realize maybe the pants aren't for me. So I see a sales area! Of course, I might belong there, I mean, look at me! I need a sale. I walk over and there are two snobby similar looking blondes. Maybe they were sisters. They are discussing something and I walk over, trying to get to the ...large...section of the sale. They stop talking and look at me. With this kind of like "This is not your territory." look. I thought they might have killed me, you know, like "What! They can't let just anyone into this store! Look at you! Look at your hair, all over the place! Your scruffy looking clothes! Your dirty sneakers! Your plain pimply face! You should be killed for just looking at this store!" So I decided the sales area was not for me. I walk over to across the sales area and I notice a shirt. ...Is this possible?....A shirt that caught my eye and not out of utter discust? I go closer and see the shirt is long sleeved...weird fabric...brown...and it has a tank top underneath it. I go "Eh? It could work." So my next journey was into the changing rooms. Now lots of girls were in the changing rooms. I got one of the rooms that was far out of the way, as if to say "Yeah you must be on the outside." I begin to change and I overhear a conversation. The father is on the cell phone and gives it to his daughter. The daughter talks about how she is in Banana Republic and how she will be out in 20 minutes. She then gets all pouty on the phone..."Well...I don't know!! I wanted to go home afterwards....UH! Fine. Fine. I said FINE!....ok bye sweetie I love you too *giggle*." ...Yeah. Um, I proceed though to try to get into the brown shirt. It's very very difficult with the tanktop attached underneath. It takes me about 15 minutes to get all the way through. I look in the mirror.   No. No. No. No. No. No. WHAT WAS I THINKING? I try to get out of it as quickly as possible but just get tangled and take more time. Meanwhile I continue to hear the father and daughter. "Oh I think those pants look good on you, dear!" "Yeah I think I want them." the mother.."I don't know, how much are they?" "Oh it doesn't matter, she's my daughter! I'll pay for them no matter what!"......Where the hell am I? What is this? A messed up Brady Bunch?  I get out quickly and put the shirt back. I then proceed to walk out of the door...very fast.  I see the sunlight.  And I'm finally there. Outside. I can breath without inhaling toxic perfume smells. Whew. I survived Banana Republic.  Yes, so I realized that...I am not one of those girls. I never will be one of those girls. I am not sure if I even want to be one of those girls. To have that much space in my brain to think about peach colored pants might drive me crazy.  That's just me though.
