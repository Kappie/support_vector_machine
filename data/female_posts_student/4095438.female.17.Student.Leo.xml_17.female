Phelps finished with a bronze behind Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband (sp). Phelps had hinted all week that he can't wait to swim in the same race as Thorpe (presumably to beat him or show him how good he is) and all week I've had to listen to American commentators boast that Phelps is now the best all-round swimmer in the world and that there has never been anyone like him (a young 19 year old).  LOL! What a joke. Thorpe was just 17 in 2000 when he smashed world records and walked away with 3 gold medals and a bag of silver and bronze.  CONGRATULATIONS Ian Thorpe, we're all so so proud of you!  Other great Aussie medal wins overnight include the first woman shooting gold medal, won by Suzanne Balogh. Also a surprise was Brooke Hanson's silver in the 100m breaststroke.  Among the disappointments are "Lethal" Leisel Jones' bronze in the 100m breaststroke after she beat the Olympic Record in the semi-finals; she was expected to finish gold and her 3rd placing does nothing to quell claims that she's a "choker". Missing out on medals are Aussie diving pair Loudy Tourky and Lynda Folauhola that finished 4th behind the Chinese, Russians  Canadians in the synchro 10m diving platform.  Once again, I was up late soaking in the Games goodness. I saw a FANTASTIC game of mens' waterpolo between the USA  Croatia that the US won after being 1 goal down with 26 seconds left in the game. They scored a goal on the siren and that was it.. only the prelims, but it was awesome to watch. the lead changed about 4 times in the last quarter.  I also saw the  urlLink aforementioned  Aussie men lose their second beach volleyball match to a Swiss pair, Norweigan women beat the Swiss in the same sport and the Australian womens' softball team get thrashed 10-0. Also of interest that I saw was the US basketball match that they lost to Puerto Rico. It brings the US Olympic win-loss record to 109-3. LOL! Unbelievable. It's just the 3rd game they've lost EVER and you should hear the doomsday predictions from the US commentators. And they wonder why I prefer to tune in to the Canadian CBC - well, that's mainly because the maple leaves seem to enjoy seeing Aust beat the USA as much as I do :P   Athens 2004 Olympic Games  GOLD: 6 Ian Thorpe - Mens 400m Freestyle, Mens 200m Freestyle Thomas/Henry/Mills/Lenton - Womens 4x100 Freestyle Relay Sara Carrigan - Womens Road Cycling Suzanne Balogh - Womens Trap Shooting Petria Thomas - Womens 100m Butterfly  SILVER: 2 Grant Hackett - Mens 400m Freestyle Brooke Hanson - Womens 100m Breaststroke  BRONZE: 4 Chantelle Newberry  Irina Lashko - Womens Synchro 3m Sp-board Diving Robert Newberry  Mathew Helm - Mens Synchro 10m Platform Diving Leisel Jones - Womens 100m Butterfly Adam Vella - Mens Trap Shooting  SWIMMING: 7 SHOOTING: 2 DIVING: 2 CYCLING: 1   Sydney 2000  GOLD: 16 SILVER: 25 BRONZE: 17  My blog will be largely Olympic Games until the closing ceremony.. it just means that there is nothing else going on here to report and I'd rather spend time finding out Olympic results than finding other articles to blog.
