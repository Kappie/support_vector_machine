The dentist explained that because I have deep crevices that brushing/flossing could not have prevented this decay. Well, that doesn't make it go away, does it? Doesn't fix the fact that it happened, hell why do I even brush if it isn't to prevent decay? At least it is small.  I just got pissed off because I love my teeth and I don't want to lose them to tiny bacteria.
