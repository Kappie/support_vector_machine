Guess what! We might not have a christmas tree! And I was oh-so looking forwards to sweeping up the pine needles that come off it! (Scrooge!) Yup, sorry guys. I'm not a very special day person though, my birthday doesn't mean a lot to me, other peoples do though! (Aww, it is scrooge!) Yeah, sorry but I know that we should all be happy happy but we're not! That's just stereotypical, what society expects. God, I sound like a right git, don't I? Don't answer. I've got a mean headache brewing and I've got a feeling that the little green men are gonna be coming out. (If you don't know me then just say WTF and be content) Ahh... I'm better now, out of moody streak. Well, we can't be happy all the time now, can we? That would just be sickening and ...Clueless like *shivers* Euugh... now let us never speak of that name again. POST DAMN YOU! POST! Sorry... just this damn thing won't work, I'm typing this while it's loading! Oh well.. ladeedaaadedummm.
