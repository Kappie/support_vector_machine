From what I remember...I was talking to this really hot girl in a bed, not my bed or a bed I knew at all necessarily, but it was a bed, a small one, so we were close together. And we were talking, and getting close, and then we were making out and it was getting really heavy. And then...one of her friends noticed us, and she jumped out of the bed and she started yelling at me, and yelling at her friend, that nothing was going on and she was just sleeping and had no idea what was going on.   I don't know what it means...but it was wierd. Really, really wierd.   Hot.   But really wierd. :P  The girl looked a lot like Jess, but not entirely.  ------------------------------------- In other news, I am rocking out to Coheed and Cambria. Go me :rockon:  In completely unrelated news, I painted my nails red today, they are quite pretty :)  And finally,   I am in love with a girl named Fred :D  //musical reference
