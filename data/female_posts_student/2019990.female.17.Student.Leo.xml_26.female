I also informed people that I created a quiz, and there is a link to it under my links if you feel so compelled to take it, be my guest.     In extemely happy news.  I got a B on my last Chemistry test.  *and the peasants rejoice*  I think I did alright on my Chemistry final day 1 of 3 as well.  It was all stuff I remembered how to do.  Joyous.  Mahinda came over tonight, and we "studied" for day 2 of 3 of the chemistry final.  It went well she was here for approximatley 4 hours and we studied for about 20 mins.  We also narrowed Mahinda's hair style choices down to three, and viewed Lola's lastest videographic masterpiece.  It's very very very very very good.     Well since my last post is MIA I should probably update you on the results of this weekends poker tournament.  I took 3rd (out of 5) but I ended up only loosing one dollar. Not to bad I don't think.  Agemmemnon practially played the beginning for me.  But I needed the help.     We had our first student council meeting today, and I'm worried for next year, because I've signed myself up for alot of stuff.  Which wasn't in my plans, and I also signed myself up for alot of classes, hard classes.  bad plan Manda.  But it's too late to change now.     I was also published in the Great Spoons Periodical.  I did a student profile on Giles, and it was actually published!  The only thing I technically wrote for it were the interview questions, and the title.  Hooray for getting to keep my title.  And thanks to Giles for providing me with the interest factor my other stories were lacking.   That's all for now.  By the way, if you haven't tried Diet Coke with Lime yet, you should be throw in jail and never released.  It's rocks.  Have a wonderful [insert time of day here].
