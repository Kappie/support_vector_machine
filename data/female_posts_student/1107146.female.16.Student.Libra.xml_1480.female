The best part of the whole thing was last night when we were out to eat, our waitress said, "Nice nails." After that, my dad spazzed and made me go buy fingernail polish remover right after dinner. It was great :p  Sadly I won't be able to meet you guys tonight :( Thanks for inviting me though. I have to go to Nasvhille to check in on my grandfather. I'll have to meet you guys sometime soon!
