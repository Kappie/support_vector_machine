Its called  urlLink NETFLIX.com  for less than 25 dollars a month, one can borrow DVDs and keep it for more than what Blockbuster will let you.  They deliver using the post office plus its guaranteed satisfaction.  I borrowed a couple of DVDs so far one didnt arrive and another was received damaged.  Not a problem, all one has to do is access the website and tell them the poor condition you had received the DVD and you will get a replacement.  This is a great deal! I borrowed Shrek tonight, cant wait its in the mail!  ~NET
