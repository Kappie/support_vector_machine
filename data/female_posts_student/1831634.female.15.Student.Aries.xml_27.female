I should've gone to sleep half an hour ago... but I got on neopets and read the news... the better than you this time is for sutek's tomb!!  so I beat it and got 3rd place and a new trophy.  =D  it's so much easier now when they reshuffle the board when you're outta moves... I had to get it reshuffled 3 times to get above a 10000 score.  but I did it!!  and now I'm above soup faerie level again...  anyways, ning is really freaking me out now.  if she actually has her little "talk" with jack, I shall have to kill her.  went over to jack's today... ended staying until 11 again.  anyways, basically got microscope done.  it looks a bit... haphazard, but it still works.  thinking to paint it black so I can disguise some of the... disformities.  (I got to a point where I didn't care what it looked like anymore.)  his parents went the the PTSA thing about psh/pwsh... so it was just us two for 2-3 hours.  and we watched TV while we ate dinner.  it was kinda funny.  his kitchen is freaking small.  then we decided to work at the dinner table and watch TV while we worked.  we were watching millionaire, and jack's guesses are freakishly accurate.  he guessed all of his right while I didn't.  I mean, there was a question on sherman's march to the sea, and I did a project on that thing and didn't know the answer while he just guessed it and got it right.  freaky as heck.  and then he finally stopped listening to techno music cuz he "got tired of it after listening to it for 7 hours" on tuesday.  oh, you know the blackout on the east US early this year?  well, it turns out that jack was actually still back in toronto when that happened, so he was actually part of the blackout.  and he told me that it was one of the days where it was actually HOT in canada... 95degrees or something, and he happened to be running a fever of 102 when the power went out.  so he was just lying on the bed with no air conditioning and no hot water just sweating to death.  (I laughed... not sure if I was supposed to or not.  but it was funny.)  and then he moved here in time for the current event on it.  isn't that just funny?  anyhow.  so now I smell like jack's house and I'm freakishly tired and it's 12.30 and I have to be at school at 7.30 for a freakin sinfonia rehearsal... jack laughed at me when I told him.  and oh my god he has SO MANY medals.  he has like plaques and medals and ribbons and certificates ALL OVER the place.  he got embarrassed, I think, when I just wandered around marveling at it all.  He won a NATIONAL piano competition... and he said it was "just crap".  I mean... ???????  and then he told me that when he was in canada, he was playing accompaniment to some of the symphonies there... I was like, WOW.  and he had a piano teacher who drove from colorado to here every two weeks just to give him lessons.  and they had no set time for the lessons, either... it was just teach teach teach play play play until one of them got too tired.  I mean... that's just astounding.  he's gonna get into harvard for sure.  (from talent.)  it made me feel really really depressed about my 4.3 in algebra one.  -__-;;  so anyways.  I still have my commapps project to do.  this bio project is really killing me.  and my chinese school teacher wants me to go to an orphanage thing on saturday morning and give a one-hour speech on the customs of america or something... in CHINESE.  I was like... oh, holy crap, PLEASE NO.  but alas... my treacherous mother already agreed for me.  while I was at jack's house.  so now... a freaking speech to do, too.  right.  commapps project.  I'm gonna die next year.  ++sunny
