What can I say about this.   1) Clinton is a very comfortable and effective public speaker. I think he's most at ease in front of a very large crowd. I think it was a very good strategic move to have him speak on Monday, rather then a time closer to when Kerry will be giving his speech, because he would have shown up Kerry. For sure. Kerry is no where close to Clinton in this regard. Well, he's no where close to Clinton in a lot of aspects, but I'm not going to get into that right now. And don't confuse that statement with undying love for Clinton either. Because it's not. Yes, I do like Clinton more then Kerry, but I don't see him as some sort of Great President. He was good. Let's leave it at that.  2) Clinton's speech was amusing. He made personal cracks at the Republicans, who were "mean" to him in the past. And I think by bringing up how he benefited from the Bush tax-cuts was a pretty ingenious way to actually be knocking the tax-cuts down.  3)  I loved how Clinton said the Democratic party would not resort to name calling in this campaign, and then he proceeded to  tear  the Republicans down.   Yeah. He might not have resorted to actual "name calling" but hostility was pretty evident.   Flash to cameo of Michael Moore.   Was that  really  necessary?   I'm thinking Clinton did a pretty good job of getting a buzz circulating through the Democratic Party. Although, if he said, "Send Me" one more time, I was going to throw a rock through my Television set.  Speaking of television. Whenever I see Clinton these days, I can't help but think of Darryl Hammond doing his impression of him on Saturday Night Live. It's so unbelievably funny! And Will Farrell's impression of Bush. Oh man, that is some good stuff.   Quote from the  urlLink NYT : " He rattled off history, scripture, sarcasm and statistics, and drew the crowd into raucous echoes of carefully scripted applause lines that he made sound as spontaneous as kitchen-table talk."  "It's a little like a combination of rock star and religious leader," said Joe Lockhart, Mr. Clinton's former press secretary, by way of explaining the former president's enduring appeal to the faithful.   Umm. Right.
