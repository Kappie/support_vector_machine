That’s okay because the stuff at the end are the movie reviews anyways.  My vertigo is returning. I was feeling better over the weekend and now….Well now I feel like a whirling dervish on a lunch break, I suppose. I can’t help but think that the concert I went to last night is the cause. It was so LOUD where we were sitting that my hair was vibrating. It must have shaken up my inner ear – physically as well as task-wise. Well, I had to call off again today, and that means that I will be done for the working for the Y this summer.  It seems extreme doesn’t it…well read on below.  I had to fight tooth and nail to keep my job last Friday, and I won. I had to fight the battle because they wanted to fire me due to the fact that I had taken vacation for a week earlier this summer and called off three days. My supervisor had the gall to mention that I took vacation and didn’t leave town. I pointed out to him that if he checked the vacation request form, that I had asked for a week and a half off and only taken a week for that very reason. And I reminded him that it was not any of his business where I went for my vacation. I also noted that I told him about the vacation BEFORE he hired me. I knew it was against YMCA policy to fire people for such reasons, so I took it to my supervisor’s supervisor aka: the head of childcare. I was allowed to return to my job Monday. But could not come back on Tuesday. So it turns out that my hard work was for nothing.  I won the battle but not the war in my attempt to stay employed and I was told that if I called off again – be it for viral illness that I have no control over or not - I was gone. Here I am a self-fulfilling prophesy in Murphy’s Law or the dark side of irony, I suppose.   I was taken off the sign-in /sign-out book after last week– which wasn’t a big deal I would rather be with the kids anyways. But it meant that I couldn’t go to work at all today. If I would have known that all I was doing is sitting around I would have suffered through it – just to keep my job. But I am (was) back to running around helping the art supplies person and kids and everything…so there is no stillness in my work time. Was. There was to be no stillness in my work time. I am heart broken over losing this job. I feel like a failure in some ways. I have given my last year and a half to the YMCA, working there in some way most of that time. My only reference in my recent years, and yet it’s going out the window. Today has more or less undone all of my hard work. I am a weak link in the chain and I don’t want to be.  But I have to get my health together, and that is my first priority. Enough moping and introspection – I have plenty of time for that later.  Monday night we saw Emerson Drive perform again. It was the third time we had seen them … or fourth. My husband’s radio station ran the show last night and intro’ed the boys twice. I got some great pictures during the show, and at the meet and greet in between their two shows. It was a nice night really. Bonus: they totally remembered me and signing my Gameboy last summer. HA! Plus, they were interested in getting emailed some of the pics that I had taken. My photography career is up and running…er, yeah. Now, it must be said that I am not a big country music person. I wouldnt consider myself a "fan" if you will, but I do have appreaciation for some of the musicians and the genre of music in and of itself. With that disclaimer I really have appreciation for Emerson Drive. They are awesome musicians who love what they do. They incorporate various genres into their music, and I am sorry I cant consider them redneck country since they are from Canada. Their Canadianess makes them that much cooler. Right well then, I will post the pics soon from their show.  I also have fish pics to post don’t I…those are on my hubby’s cpu…I will have to roust them out later as well.  I have been reading news the last few days about a planned terror attack by the al-quaida on the US during our elections. I have to say that this Bush administration propagation of the threat of terror to disrupt our elections sounds like a scare tactic to get voters to stay home. HA! Well I hope it backfires on them and that they discover that Republicans are the only people spineless enough to stay at home instead of voting under the “credible threat” of a terror attack!!!! *pant pant pant* Something tells me that if the threat was truly credible that our CIA and FBI intelligence officials wouldn’t have heard of it. But that would be the cynic in me.  I also read about some small movie theatre chains in Illinois and Indiana refusing to show Fahrenheit 9/11 due to the fact that they see it as propaganda and they have an anti-propaganda policy. I hope that these two theatres do not advertise, nor advertise themselves before the movie in the previews and whatnot. Also I hope that they don’t run those commercials before the movies  - like the US Army ads in particular. Advertisement is just another form of propaganda…the difference is that most people think advertising is innocuous. It is funny to me where people will chose to draw their battle lines.  Ah, and Kerry finally announced (with no surprise to me) his VP as John Edwards. I saw that one coming. I also saw a photo on the front page of our local newspaper of Kerry and Edwards and couldn’t help but notice that Edwards looks a great deal like JFK in some ways. I think that voters that are easily swayed by the looks of a candidate might just be sold. Me? Well I think that a natural choice for the VP would be the runner-up in the primaries. It means that many people in the country supported the candidate and *conceptually* would then support another candidate with their choice on the ticket. He’s young, he’s a newbie, and what can I say – I think he will inject some charm and positivity into the Kerry campaign. Besides, with Edwards aboard it means that Kerry stands half a chance with voters in the South (apparently.)  This brings up something else that I have wondered about…voters in the South seem to worry about the New Englander point of view not reflecting theirs. I get this impression from news stories from sources such as the AP and whatnot that state as much. But people from California aren’t portrayed as worrying whether their western concerns will be met…and people from Nebraska aren’t portrayed as worrying that the candidate is not from the Midwest so they might not share their values….So what is it about the South? Well, is it a Civil War hangover? Is it the concept that they *know* they are a minority and that their views are not well reflected across the country as a whole? And why does the South have so much power anyway? So odd to see that a presidential candidacy might find lines drawn across regional perceptions or stereotypes.   Right, well then far too much (and quite enough) politics.   My husband and I came up with a sequel to White Chicks – or perhaps just an MTV Movie Awards bit. Tow-headed white girls that have to dress up as black men. Oh the casting fun!  With me sick and bored beyond belief my husband and I invested in a second Gameboy and bought the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game that has been out for quite a while. I love the technological conceptualizing that led to Nintendo to using their handheld systems as controllers. With an RPG this is very helpful. All of the menus that one needs to access are viewed on the GBA (Gameboy Advanced) instead of on the TV screen. Crystal Chronicles is also a multiplayer RPG which is an answer to my quiet little video game prayers. The graphics and animation are pretty, the story line is good, the levels are interesting and challenging, and the game provides new and more difficult concepts as it moves forward. The game integrates a lot of unique concepts and is a lot of fun! I suggest that any RPG hooked readers of my blog (You know who you are!!!) get away from the online RPG and into this socially interactive, real time game.   Okay, now for the movie review segment. It will be quick and dirty unlike my normal more involved reviews.  Around the World in 80 Days: Jackie Chan and some new faces and TONS of cameos. This is a decent comedy - it changes the original story a bit and still manages to remain entertaining due to the efforts of the actors. It is not a typical Jackie Chan movie, and for some people that might be its downfall. For me, I almost didn’t go see it as it is a Disney enterprise. Disney can ruin anything good – even Jackie Chan. Well it turns out that the only things Disney messed with were the animated traveling transitions and the credits. The animation was fine, the credits sucked. I do have to give Disney credit for resisting the urge to use “It’s a Small World After All” until the credits however.  The acting was better than expected, the scriptwriting was good enough, the actors did seem to work well together, and it was a group effort to get this movie to make it. The exception to this cast grouping was the actor who played Detective Fix – every time he came on screen the audience members felt the urge to cause him great amounts of pain, well at least I did.  80 Days is a popcorn matinee flick that still is a lot of fun, and probably better than the original movie made from the story. I guess I was spoiled by an extremely awesome stage version of “Around the World in 80 Days” that I saw in North Carolina a couple years ago. Four actors, a table and chairs, and little else other than costuming and some nice backgrounds and some sliding doors went into the play.  But yet the play was hilarious and sooooooo well acted, and the minimalism was more Shakespearian in feel than uber modern. But ah well, the “legitimate stage” wins again.   Dodgeball: Ben Stiller, Ben Stiller’s wife, the stapler dude from Office Space, Vince Vahgn, and more. This would be the first Ben Stiller movie that has been released this year that even looked like it was worth my time (little of all my money.) We went to see it late one night on our week of vacation and enjoyed it. We actually had to make two attempts to see the movie...the first attempt was foiled as we arrived 5 minutes after the showtime to find the movie theatre locked and the employees insisting they could not sell us tickets. I checked with a manager the next day...the theatre is supposed to stay open for 45 minutes after the last showtime. Oops. The naughty, lazy employees got caught. But back to the movie!  Perhaps we enjoyed it more for the semi-nostalgic, semi-nerdboy dodgeball theme than for any other reason.  Ben Stiller’s wife stole the movie as far as the acting goes. She was an utter scene stealer. One of the funniest parts of the whole movie is after the credits so make sure to sit through them. I read a couple of movie review columnists opinion about the Ben Stiller-a-thon that seems to be going on this year. I have to agree with them that the more prolific Stiller gets, the worse off his audience is going to be. But, Dodgeball may be his one in five that works. Who knows.  This is once again a goofy popcorn flick that if you have just had a financial windfall might be worth a night ticket, but is more likely a matinee.  Terminal: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta Jones. This was a great great great (Do I see an Oscar nomination?) flick! Tom did a great job playing an Eastern Bloc Nation immigrant with a mission. The concept of a nowhere man has never quite been so endearing. The writing was witty and charming, the other characters were well done, the world of the airport was well formulated, the presentation of the homeland security types was entertaining and perhaps enlightening. Plus, an audience member you really "fall in love" with Tom Hank’s character to a certain extent. Catherine Zeta Jones did not add much to this movie, and a relative newcomer might have been a better casting choice. The pacing of the movie was slow at times but I think that was intentional to give the audience the feeling of waiting such that the main character felt. This is one of those movies that is practically universal in its appeal. I recommend seeing this movie, evening show with popcorn, candy, and soda – because it is just worth it.  Stepford Wives: Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler This movie was a new more modern take on the old movie and the original book which both movies were supposedly based on. Both movies sooooo missed the point. In the book the suburban men kill their wives, in the first movie the director used this angle to turn the flick into a horror movie. In the new version no one dies, but rather they get transformed into robots – more or less because of a chip in their brain. But the movie still could have made a statement of some kind, or come up with some concept to address…but no! The movie backed away from making a point and stayed in the “slightly entertaining only” realm. I always thought Fozzie Bear had a spine. But I guess Frank Oz might be waning in his olden days. The ending really backs away from making a point other than perhaps the “it’s not men oppressing women, it’s women oppressing each other” idea that has only been bounced around in post-feminist circles that bow to Martha Stewart. Go see this movie only if you are a campy Midler fan or want to see how the gay couple issue is tackled in this updated Stepford stepchild. Its matinee quality with candy sneaked in from the drugstore.  Spiderman II: Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina Quite an enjoyable romp in the nature of superhero-dum. I liked this better than the first Spiderman – and other than Mary Jane’s too red hair I had no complaints about the first one either. The special effects are a given for Spiderman, as were the cameo appearances by Bruce Campbell (Bubba HoTep) and Stan Lee. Miss Dunst turned in another great performance as did Mr. Maguire. It was Alfred Molina who stole this movie however. His great handling of Doctor Octopus puts into perspective why Spiderman has really been the biggest hit of the comic book movie genre. The acting. It probably doesn’t hurt that the writer is the creator of the comic, or that the director is a complete comic book nerd…But it is really the great acting that keeps the Spiderman movies afloat instead of sinking to the middle or the bottom with most of the other comic book based movies. Not only are the actors of great caliber…they put all of their acting chops into their roles. It’s not a parody of a hero, its not just the surface of their skills. I guess Sam Raimi (the director) can be credited with helping the actors buy into what they are doing, and go all out. The good: MJ’s hair is a natural shade of red this time, Doc Oc makes everything more important…he’s an evil villain with clear motivation and most importantly he’s not really evil at all – that’s the selling point. More of the good: Spiderman’s unmasking. Oh yeah. It was time for it to happen. The Bad: The newspaper editor’s reaction change from “Spiderman saved my son’s fiancée!!!” to “He’s evil” in the span of 2.5 seconds with little motivation. I didn’t buy it. Neither will most of the rest of the audience. This might be part actor problem and part script…but either way it sticks out like a sore thumb in an otherwise seamless movie. The Ugly: The Green Goblin looks set for a comeback. I think it will pull the whole Spidey movie enterprise beyond the boundaries of Emerald City. But, with the writer of the comic book writing the movies, sticking with the truth of the time line of the comics will come into play. I guess it’s fate. Ick.  Overall: Worth evening tickets…worth paying for evening tickets for your whole family with popcorn and the whole nine yards. Go see this.    King Arthur: A Jerry Bruckheimer production starring Keira Knightly and Clive Owen. A little disclaimer at the beginning explains that recent archeological evidence gives new light to King Arthur's legend moving it from the Middle Ages to the Dark Ages and that this movie is showing you that Dark Ages legend. Blame it on the history channel special about this very subject (sponsored by the movie to boot) that makes me cough a *bullshit* at this notation. Right, well I wont harp on historical/archeological/what is known thus far and the innacuracies any further because despite the annoyance of a few of these issues I still enjoyed the movie.  I have read reviews about it in a few places that had less than kind things to say. It seems Jerry Bruckheimer has quite a reputation and not many friends. People are already poo-pooing his version of Phantom of the Opera that is due out in theatres at around Christmastime or so. Maybe I am the last person to be told why this is the case. I liked Pirates of the Carribean! But onto the movie at hand.  The Good: The knights were great characters, and I liked the backstory created for them as to why they were serving the Roman empire. I liked the ideals of Arthur seen as born from belief in a cause and in a government that he doesnt realize no longer exists - rather than just an idealistic man for no apparent reason. This Arthur has motivation for his ideals, and an example set for him. I enjoyed Kiera Knightly's performance...even if it took on Lady MacBeth overtones at times. Machiavelli would be proud of her Guinevere. It is interesting the way they handled the whole Lancelot issue...especially since Lancelot as part of the story of King Arthur is a French invention...of the Middle Ages... So, I think its a unique perspective the way Lancelot is handled (no spoilers since its still in the theatres...) The ice battle scene is very suspenseful and well handled. Its creative and even gives some more insight to war and battle strategy of that time.  The Guinevere seduction scene reminds me of the Morgana/Morgain seduction of Arthur of some literary sources that were transformed into film via Excalibur in 1981. Right, well the scenes resemble each other. This I find interesting. Perhaps it is a nod to a movie that made Arthur popular again? The Bad: The lack of explanation behind who the Saxons were or why they were invading. One sided villains suck. Some of the varying accents among peoples who were *supposed* to be the same heritage was a little irritating. Why were the Woads the only ones to speak a different language? In reality none of the characters would have spoken English. ENGLISH DIDNT EXIST YET. Right so I am harping on historical stuff again...sorry. But the inconsistency that the Woads/Picts were the only ones that didnt speak the uniform language was ANNOYING. Not enough was done with Merlin. He was not mysterious nor mystic at all - even if they didnt want to show a magical world but rather a real world....he still could have been "mystical" - and his character wasnt developed in the least to boot. Maybe thats because in all of the historical data they found thus far there is no proof of Merlin? Then why is he in the movie? He moves no plot devices nor elements than another character could have equally done. Right. Well that character gripe tied into historical stuff...sorry.  Maybe a movie shouldn't state that its based on new archeological evidence...unless it really is. And thats the Ugly. The statement at the beginning is all well and good, but this movie is not a historical dramatisation. Bruckheimer's version is another fictionalized re-telling of the legend, it just happens to come from and older source that could be more accurate if the legend has any truth to it at all.  It is still a good work and, as I said, I enjoyed watching it. But the preamble to the movie...made the experience more of a "catch the historical innacuracies" game than it would have been if it had presented itself more as fictitious. Overall: Matinee fodder, unless you have a good date - because then it might be worth a night ticket. A little chivalrous reinforcement of loyalty never hurt anyone too much. If you go at night, skip the popcorn.  Fahrenheit 9/11: Made by Michael Moore I had been waiting for this movie for quite a while now. Thank god he came through and made it, and thank god again that the Weinstein’s know a hit when they see one. This movie is the documentary film genre at it’s best. Entertaining, shocking, maddening, inducing squeamishness, and making sure that when you leave the theatre you come out a different version of yourself than when you went in. It’s hard not to have an emotional response to this movie. Most people who read this blog know what it is about but just in case: Moore explores the Arab business and family contacts that G.W. Bush and company are tied to. Moore further looks at these relationships in relationship to 9/11, the attacks on Afghanistan, and the war in Iraq. Moore also spends some time wading back through the 2000 election….reminding me of one of the reasons I am not “proud to be an American.” A democracy should never mean a court decides who is president. Whatever happened to checks and balances? I don’t think the Constitution intends this country to have court appointed presidencies. At any rate, Moore takes a look at soldiers in Iraq, the people in Iraq, the US statesmen, and some everyday ordinary US citizens that are parents of US soldiers in Iraq.  The Good: A movie that engages the grey matter between our ears…YAY! Having seen all of Michael Moore’s documentary films, this one involves seeing or hearing Michael Moore less during the interviews. He could be seen to have to lead interviews where he wanted them to go – I can’t help but think of the Charleton Heston or Marilyn Manson interviews in “Bowling for Columbine” as examples of this. However in this movie and these interviews – he lets his subjects do the talking. They guide the conversation and make their own points…which it could be said then that it seems like Michael Moore is bringing the opinions that many people hold and border on holding to the forefront - rather than simply promoting his own opinions.  Also, Moore’s use of music and comic relief are excellent. I like the little subtitle footnotes and his narration. The Ice Cream truck stunt was impressive. I laud the people who put their necks on the lines for standing up for their beliefs and appearing in this movie. The Bad: Ummmm……*Tries to be the slightest bit Subjective* Hell, this is a review on my blog…I don’t have to be subjective!!!! The Ugly: President Bush sitting in a Florida classroom 9/11/01 reading a book about a goat, until someone else told him it was time to do something about the terrorist attacks that just happened. Overall: Good enough to spending evening prices, and pay for your whole neighborhood to boot. Popcorn all around.   Rentals Segment:  The Producers: Mel Brooks brainchild that put him on the map of satire starring Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel. The movie wasn’t great, and I am not just saying that because I don’t like Gene Wilder…I am saying that because the comic timing seemed off, the acting was hammier than need be, and while the musical numbers in the play within the play, er, movie were hilarious…(Springtime for Hitler, indeed) they still couldn’t hold the entire movie up on a musical stretcher to cross the finishing line. The Broadway stage version has gotten rave reviews with Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick at the helm and there is a remake of the movie due out next year starring Lane and Broderick.  The Good: Excellent satire fodder, even if it comes up short. The Bad: Too much to recount. The Ugly: Zero Mostel’s comb-over. Overall: Wait for the new version to come out in the movies, or see it on Broadway…Don’t even use a library free rental for this one.  Flashdance: Jennifer Beals Ah the 80’s! I had never seen this movie surprisingly. But maybe that’s because I was six when it came out. There isn’t all that much of note about this 80’s classic. There is cheesy choreography, stand-in dancing (a man danced Jennifer Beals difficult moves,) a transparent plot line, second class dirty dancing, and some costumes that make me wince. I have always liked the idea of and did enjoy the welding work and the side of the storyline that shows her as an iron worker. Plus, on an odd note, I kept wondering why the director seemed to think Beals looked better wet.  What is notable about this flick is the music. Now, most of the time these days if a song from a movie is a hit, it is because the movie was a hit and brought the song into the stage lights. Flashdance takes a dash of this idea and reverses it to boot. It uses music and songs that were popular at the time to beef up it’s soundtrack and help set the mood. This tactic had the effect of spreading the songs (and the idea of dancing to them) even further in the subconscious of Americans. It also used a song that was not well-known for the opening credits and within the movie. The association of this song with the others in the movie gave “What a Feeling” wings it would not have otherwise had.  The Good: The Music, the welding, Pittsburgh as the city it was filmed in. The Bad: Much of the dancing, the plot, the firing of Beals character so that she would go on a date with her boss. The Ugly: Beals soaking wet. The movie could have been titled Splashdance. Some of the choreography was beyond bad…it moved into the realm of downright ugly. So don’t say I didn’t warn you. Overall: Rent this if and only if you are absolutely craving your legwarmers.  The Saint: Roger Moore’s early TV success. The Saint is an interesting little trip in the TV Land history. The role of the Saint led directly to Moore’s casting as James Bond. In fact, he had to turn down the role the first time it was offered to him because of his commitments to The Saint. Thus, Sean Connery got a shot at Bond. The show is old, so don’t expect great effects, great locations, or even a lack of plot holes. (Why would Germans in the 1960’s be driving American cars???) Hmmm. There is some cheesy acting, and bad make-up moments. Moore having to fix his mussed hair after ever fight scene may annoy the snot out of you. Plus, they turn an ordinary white guy into a Middle Eastern character with some brown pan stick. Sad. Still, with all of the tv show's faults it’s hard not to fall for Moore’s debonair Saint. I guess the bonus is in the endings too…they usually have a twist of some kind that would have been somewhat new to audiences at that time. The Good: Young Roger Moore. The Bad: The Budget of the TV show. The Ugly: Lack of eye for detail among the show’s creators. Overall: Check this out at your local library if you can. I wouldn’t buy the DVD’s unless you are a super Moore fan or just a super Bond fan and want a piece of the history. It is your call whether to pay to rent them from a store or not.    BBC’s Sherlock Holmes: Starring Jeremy Brett as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous gumshoe of the title. I don’t have to say much about this series. It has critical acclaim left and right already – and it has been out for a while. I have seen most of the series previously and there are quite a few of Conan Doyle’s novels and short stories featured in the BBC series.  We rented The Hound of the Baskervilles – recalling me to the sleepless nights I sat up reading the book too enthralled to stop reading and too scared to go to sleep. I was in Junior High when I read the Complete Sherlock Holmes. I would say that Conan Doyles work had a profound effect on me.  These movie versions were very very well done. The BBC has always been known for their historical pieces, and the setting is so well handled in these productions that you might never catch an anachronism at all. Jeremy Brett was perfect casting for Holmes, and it might be unfair to say so but his rendering of the character has made all others since and before look pale in my eyes. (And believe me its harder to get more pasty than Mr. Brett!) If I see Sherlock Holmes portrayed – it’s Brett I expect to see.  Although, I must note that my hubby and I did catch a surprisingly good stage version of Sherlock Holmes at The Red Barn Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee. It was written by the director of the theatre and was an original play featuring Holmes and Watson. The Red Barn is a dinner theatre, so we had Watson as a waiter to boot. But back to the BBC version…some of the effects leave you wishing the BBC had a better budget – but the mood more than makes up for the low budget special effects. The Good: The perfect Holmes and Watson bring great literature to life. The Bad: The actual hound of title was not nearly what could be done today…The Ugly: The hound wins again. Overall: Rent these from your local library and curl up for a good mystery night!  TV Notes: The new season of Dead Like Me starts next week!!!!! Check it out on Showtime. Here's the official TV show website: http://www.deadlikeme.tv/index.php I was mistaken in earlier blogness to think this was an HBO production. Wrong I was! It's Showtime!  Okay, finally, I am caught up!!!! With no job, I don’t figure I will fall far behind again. But for now I am done…This was a long post. Thanks for the patience to read it loyal bloggers, and that’s all the news (and then some) in fits of print.  --Mack
