I met a whole buncha ppl over there @ Carolann's party, but I don't care to remember all their names. Her uncle's cool though.  NEway,  I actually watched an R rated movie, and it wasn't as scary as Carolann tried to make me think... It was THIR13EN GHOSTS in case you care at all... And we watched Galerians:Rion 2. It wasn't actually all that bad... but the makers of that movie are severely twisted. Either that or they have a LOT of time on their hands. But I DO like the soundtrack... which we r listening 2 right now b/c Carolann has it.  Yeah well.  Ooh we had cheesecake! That was good... and popcorn and chips  ((mild salsa, not 2 hot! *lol*)) And her mommy bought me  Stewarts root beer... mmmm... that's the best! Well we rented  Along Came Polly  and  The Perfect Score  so it's movie night! Hmmm... that's pretty much all 4 now. Catcha l8tr ppl!!!
