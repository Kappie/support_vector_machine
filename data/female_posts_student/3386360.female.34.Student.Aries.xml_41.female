I’m holding his stuff here as collateral for the damage done to the other place and the lack of doing what needed to be done. I’m sick of his excuses. Today was the last day and he is no longer welcomed here at my house. Dave is no longer welcomed at my  house ether. He put a hole in the wall and promised to patch it up and failed to do so. Why ? Pussy was more important. I’m sick of it. I’m tired of being used and I’m letting everyone know it. I will not allow it anymore. They can all kiss my ass. Period. I will not see my deposit, because Travis, who in exchange for staying at the old place for 2 weeks refused to clean like he said he would. Instead it is even a worse mess then when I left it. Plus the hole in the wall. Plus all the other crap. I just fucking quit I hate it. I’m sick of it and if I had my way he would fucking be out of here, this state or in jail for GOOD. I’m so tired of hearing the same male fucking excuse. “I got distracted”. Distracted by people, pussy, or whatever else. They do what they want on their time and then come to me to clean up their fucking messes and take care of their fucking shit. BULL SHIT. I don’t know what to think right now I just want to go take a shower and then I have to clean MY house of rachael’s stuff that she brought over last night when she suddenly appeared at my door to “stay” due to her fight with her daughter in law. Gods I hate this crap. Sorry I am cursing more then I normally do. I should go. Shower, clean and then rest. So much for limited activity and bed rest huh? Oh yeah I guess this classifies as “avoiding stress”.. NOT
