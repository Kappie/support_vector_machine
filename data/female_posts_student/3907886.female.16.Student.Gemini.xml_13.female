I don't know exactally when I fell asleep, but it was something like 9ish. Then, at midnight, my phone rang. I went to answer it, but no one was there. I tried to fall back to sleep, but woke up at 2 to go to the bathroom, but because my potty doesn't work, I had difficulties. I didn't want to go all the way upstairs, so I tried to fix it, and ended up making a mess. The water started coming out of the bottom, and the carpet as well as my feet got soaking wet. I just decided to turn off the water. I stripped off my clothes, way to tired by now to actually change. Seeing how it was like 4 in the morning, that's completely understandable.  Around 7am, my mom came down to wake me up, because I had a doctor appt. at 8:30. So we drove to Oshkosh both still half asleep. After waiting for like an hour, I saw the doc, all went well, and we were out by 10. I was hungry, so my mum and I went over to ihop. The food their is ok. Not my fav, but not like puck it all up cause it's so gross... After eating, we stoped into walgreens to get some nessecities, and then the bank so i could get some $.  My mom dropped me off at like 11:00. I went straight to bed. now it's 12:30, and I'm waking up again. Well, off to face the day again!  ~Ani
