It's been a nice day, but I'm beginning to feel guilty about not reading. Eh, I just do stuff tomorrow. I really need to get the tree down and Christmas things put away.  Now Jerm is looking over my shoulder disapprovingly. Clearly, he doesn't read his email regularly. Jerm now wants me to clarify that he was merely confused, not disapproving... I must leave to help make dinner, so I am properly contributing.
