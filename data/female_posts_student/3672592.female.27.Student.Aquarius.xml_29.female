Our District Superintendent was at church so this was the best sermon that I've heard out of our preacher since he came. Other great things about church is that we sang great old hymns and heard great old hymns sung. After church we had lunch at the church, hamburgers YUM. While we were eating we serenaded by great old hymns and gospel music, by a gentleman from our church. All together church made up for such a horrible evening.
