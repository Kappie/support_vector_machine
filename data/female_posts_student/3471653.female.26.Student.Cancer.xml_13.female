Dan said that he had some serious doubts about organ transplantation because of the way that it cut up human bodies--which to him suggested a profound disrespect for the resurrection of the dead.   At the time I thought that position was a little extreme, but  urlLink this article on organ trafficking in Mozambique  is making me rethink what he said.    Note the role Israel is playing in the organ trafficking business--and, in contrast, the role of Christian women in making this horror known to Christians (at first I wrote, "known to the West," but then I realized that the market for these organs IS the West).
