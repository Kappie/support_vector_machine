But, at like 12:00 it stopped raining and it got really hot out, so we got to have the party after all! We got a hold of everyone and they all could come except 1 person. So, I took a shower at my house, then we went back to Emily's house and she took a shower while I got my really hott outfit on! My outfit consisted of yoga pants, a t-shirt, a pink flower tangtop, my dads work out belt (pretty hott), tights, powerpuff girl slipper socks, socks on my hands, pom poms, brownies hair style, and of course my brush! I got really hot outside, but then it rained so it was ok! Anyway, we all went to the track and we were having the greatest time. I was trying to pull a cart with everyone on it except for Katie and Emily. It was kinda hard and now my back hurts...When we all got bored of the track Ryan, Kalyn, Britney, Katie, and Emily played on this thing with water on it. Then we went to the playground and played survivor. That was pretty fun.....That was until Katie ankled Emily, and Emily got mad at her. Then it started raining pretty hard. Ryan and Kalyn went home because Britney ripped Kalyns shirt strap on accident...(oops!). Well then we went to Emily's house and sat around. We were laughing and spraying each other with the hose..Emily immitated MIKE NETZLE!! Now that was hilarious. After a while we went back to Abe and Emily and I stood under the dripping water off the school and got soaked!! Then some highschool guys and Matt from our grade came over and asked Em to race....He would have given her a dollar if she won! Wow..After they left we went to the playground, and played survivor......again.....Then Kristine came and she looked really tan today..hmm..OK..Well when Kristine came we went back to Emily's house and just talked and hung around till everyones parents got there. We had a long wait for Julies dad...but he came eventually! Emily couldnt spend the night at my house tonight :(...bummer...But I'm talking to her right now so it's mostly all good! Now i have to type all my 6 page quotes over that I lost the first time i made this blog...THANKS BLOG!!!! GEEZ...
