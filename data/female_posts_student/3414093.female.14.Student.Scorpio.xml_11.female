So the first one had to do with my dad and stepmom...who I don't live with anymore because they are collectively satan.  Anyways I was at their house (which wasn't really their house but it was a dream so I will excuse that) and I don't really remember much...but it was weird...cuz I hate them...  The second one was really long and strange...I was at this farm like place and there were a bunch of people my age and it was like we were being tested or trained for something.  It was kinda scary...they had us doing all these things...like there was this horizontal pole really high up and we had to put something in the middle of it...and then there were shovels...and I got yelled at a lot...I just remember bits and peices but it was weird...  Okay...I was thinking about this while I was waiting for the computer to boot-up and I really want to fall asleep in someone's arms while watching The Labyrinth and drinking vodka and vanilla coke...the thought came out of no where...  I hate my computer...my msn isn't working again, meaning I have to re-boot, which psses me off...maybe I'll go make a disgustingly sugar-y treat...ice cream, marshmallows, chocolate, cinnamon...mmmmmm...okay anyways, I think thats all I have to say right now...  I love old music...thank god for growing up with hippies (granola...haha Dave...)  Still haven't found Eleanor Rigby...maybe cuz I got fed up and stopped looking...if anyone finds it could they please link me to it...thanks!!  XOXO  P.S. I just realized that the time on my updates is way off...but now that you know its wrong all is well...so I won't bother changing it every time i post...  Chera
