Looking at major-label music today, and female rock and roll role models for teenage girls, I just want to puke in my pocket.    I really don't think it gets any worse than  urlLink this fake-ass little brat .  I have to hand it to Katie Couric, though: when Avril appeared on the Today Show a couple weeks ago, not only did Katie bring up Avril's wicked-Christian past in Canada, but the fact that not just four-year-olds love Avril, but moms, too! Whee!    Avril looked like she was wishing real bad that she was hard enough to tell Katie to fuck off.  Heh.  The other day I heard Green Day for the first time in years.  And for the first time ever, they sounded punk as fuck to me.  This is even taking into consideration their role in the "Seinfeld" series finale.  I think that's a real testament to what's going on now.    I would also add-- possibly also as a testament to how much time has passed-- that back then, Courtney Love was my idol.  I remember when she and Kurt were featured in Sassy magazine talking about how "zits are beauty marks" and stuff like that. Fucking fabulous.  This was back when she was  urlLink at least more Nancy Spungen  than  urlLink Hollywood freakshow.    Oh well.  And don't even get me started on Fred Durst.
