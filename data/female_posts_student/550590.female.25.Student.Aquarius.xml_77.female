Last night was a night of sheer sillyness and debauchery with Ryan and Matt, including a wonderful Italian dinner where the couple at the table next to us got engaged.  Then it was back to the hotel for fun with smokes and liquor.  Today we went to the National Gallery of Art and had fun on the Metro and went shopping.  Ann Taylors and Starbucks all over the place.  I picked up an apartment guide and I will be moving here ASAP.  Joy.  More later on in the week.  Time for cards with the kiddies.
