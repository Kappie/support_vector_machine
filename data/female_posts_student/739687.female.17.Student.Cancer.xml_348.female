People are so dramatic and really really annoying. Not all people, just namely a certain portion.  Went and got bbq with the manda and the brachel earlier today. Bueno bueno.  I'm tired...and I don't feel like doing anything else tonight. I work at 6 tomorrow evening but I should get off by like 7 or 7:30, so that'll be cool. And Sunday night...ooooh buddy I'm gonna drink myself crazy.  At least I'd better.  Well crazies, I'll talk at ya later.
