So i ended up in Egypt and asked someone for directions, and of course they were wrong. So I got lost again. But with my incredible intellegence, I figured it out on my own and finally got to Target in Brooklyn Center. I got there and the poor kid was so busy! I felt so bad for him but I hope the Egg McMuffin made him a lil happier.   So I came home, helped my dad fix the dent in my car because someone decided that it would be funny to kick my door in... bastards.   So my day hasnt been too eventful, but if we get nuked or something huge like that happens, i'll update again.   word.  Kuff
