Its the only one in allll of portland that acctually covered enough and looked good. Sad.  Then I got the coolest shorts EVER at Nordstrom...  they aren't short!!! The go down to just above my knees. It rocks!!  Lalalalla  I am eating my chicken burger with fries in it will a knife and fork..its really sad :)
