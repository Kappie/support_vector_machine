And I got my own character ^_^ so I had to be sorted into a house.  So I'ma taking the quiz thingy and guess what? I get Gryffindor. =.= Great, I share house with "I-know-everything" bitch and the amazing reproducing weasels.(Weasleys) (STOP MATING DAMMIT!!!) And as I sit in the thrilldom of being a Gryffindor I wonder "why me?" I mean I should at least get Ravenclaw, if anything. Amee got Ravenclaw. I get multiple redheads. Everyone gets into Gryffindor. WHY CAN'T I GET SOMETHING ORIGINAL?!?   Gryffindors are all honorable and noble and brave and crap like that. Honorable? Do I look like I'm from Ruroni Kenshin? AM I A GODDAMN SAMURAI?!? Noble? Hell, I belch whenever I feel like it. I am known to sit with my legs apart whilst wearing a skirt. DOES THAT SOUND NOBLE TO YOU?!? And finally, brave. I can't go through one episode of Unsloved Mysteries without cringing and wanting to call a friend to comfort me.  I ain't a Gryffindor. I am a Ravenclaw. Hell, I am more Slytherin than Gryffindor(er...I think...) Why would I be Gryffindor? So I'll just sit here in my "wonderful" House of Gryffindor and not stare at the twins's asses.   Mood of the Day: Sadistic and hungry...I WANT FOOD!!!*puppy whine* Bishie of the Day: Most Definatly NOT the twins. NOT. *is NOT staring thank you very much.*
