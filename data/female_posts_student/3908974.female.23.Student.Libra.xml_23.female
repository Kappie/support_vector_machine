I look awfully funny with only one red one.  Had a good night.  After my slinkster cool breakdancer friend went home, I stripped down to underwear and talked on the phone for a couple of hours.  Something made me decide to just cut the crap and tell my man the Big Bad Secret.  I realized that there is a turning point in relationships, and thereafter, it's hard to introduce new and threatening information.  So even though I was sitting on my couch drinking a coke, I felt like I was standing on the edge of a precipice, looking for the courage to jump.  He was very understanding.  I feel lighter now, freed from the burden of living a public fiction.  At least with him.    Woke this morning covered in scratches again.  Dreams featuring dimly lit French restaurants mingled with tatty beer stained bowling alleys and highschool classrooms and cookie cutter suburban houses.  I dreamed I went to Jill's house, the imaginary lady I dreamed of the other night.  She had two teenaged daughters, but they were gone.  I tried on their wigs.  One was just your typical short and styled Afro.  The other was Las Vegas, all pretty braids and colored feathers.  When I put the plain one on, I became black while I looked in the mirror, but I still mostly had the same features.  Jill was like, Oh, no, this won't do.  Then we went to some grease pot burger joint and had dinner.  My roommate comes home soon.  She's back safely from Africa.  I hear through the grapevine she met someone over there, a cosmic Kenyan man who rocked her world and lit up her intellect.  I am glad she met someone, because she's been so duty bound and it's made her get old too soon.  Me, I'm just feeling really entrenched in Kansas because two pillars of my social life get to go off on these fabulous adventures.      I spent her first night away taking pipes with her boyfriend, which I know is bad form.  Somehow she's convinced that he has a marijuana addiction, which is a terrible misconception.  Obviously he gets high way too much, but that's more of a symptom of some other problem, i.e. an inability to cope with the world without a buffer or just an overdose of hedonism compounded by a substantial trust fund.  So anyway, I officially contributed to his decline, and although I don't put much stock in that idea, I was definitely being thoughtless at the time.  But now I wonder if that will even matter.  I hope not, because I am very curious about her trip, and I want to hear about it in graphic detail.  I have a vested interest in Africa, which came about in a weird way.  I was doing the typical Spanish 101 thing my freshman year, then I met my husband and forgot I was enrolled in college.  So I bombed everything, forgot my verb tenses, and ended up convinced that I was going to join the Peace Corps with this man, who was at the time an Anthropology major, learning Swahili as part of his recommended course work.  I took it up next time the opportunity came about.  That's where I met my dearest roommate (an African Studies major) and the most influential teacher of my life, Mwalimu.  (Mwalimu is not her name, just a respectful way of addressing a teacher in Swahili.)  Anyway, I took her for three years, and the last year, I was the only student in the upper level section.  The ex switched his major to mine, trusty old Creative Writing, and blew off the class, only recalling one-liners to impress the ladies at the bar.  But I liked it, so I kept at it, and now I am just about fluent in Swahili, of all things.  And I know a hatful of things about Africa and its people.  And my man, well, I met him through my roommate.  (So thank you, oh ex of mine, for encouraging me to follow you to the "Dark Continent," because I'm really happy now.)  Isn't that goddamn crazy, how life plays out?    I am still going to join the Peace Corps when I finish my Masters, and I will surely be stationed in Kenya or Tanzania.    So I have written too much, but I'm on telephone duty at work, and I can't bear the boredom of it.  Must do a crossword.
