Set in an area which is still suffering from the effects of a devastating war, Eberron stays true to the world of the Dungeons  Dragons we know and love while creating a new style for the campaign which mixes traditional medieval with a bit of a sci-fi twist. Airships, lightning rails, and warforged beings similar to robots exist, but instead of being powered by electricity, they are controlled by magical means. Four new player character races - changelings, the children of dopplegangers and humans with shapeshifting powers , warforged, golems who have souls created during the war, Kalashtar who share their soul with dream plane exiles, and shifters (yay, that's going to be me) who take on the form of different creatures and beings instead of staying in one form - have been added to the game.   urlLink Eberron Campaign Setting  along with  urlLink Shadows of the Last War  are the books that come out in June, while  urlLink Sharn: City of Towers   and  urlLink Whispers of the Vampire's Blade  will follow the release of those books. Eberron miniatures are also set to come out, including  urlLink Giants of legend  and other sets. A series of Eberron novels by  urlLink Matt Forbeck  and  urlLink Keith Baker  should appear on shelves, not to mention the adventures created by Keith Baker which will show up  urlLink Dungeon  magazine. D online - set in Eberron - is being developed by  urlLink Turbine  and will allow players from all over to play together in this new world.  More products are sure to come out to add on to the Eberron explosion over time, bringing more new opportunities and chances to explore places in the world of D which no one has yet set foot in.
