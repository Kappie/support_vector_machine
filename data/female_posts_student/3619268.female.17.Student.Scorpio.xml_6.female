Has anyone ever noticed that A) this blog shtick is quite addicting and B) just when you think everything in life is going peachy, karma comes back to laugh maniacally in your face despite the fact that your daily good deeds outweigh your bad? ((props head up on hand and looks at you))... I suppose I should describe a wee bit about myself before launching into this entry, though... how rude of me to babble long before I introduce myself...  As you can tell from my previous entries, my name is Meg, and I seem to live a very bored and highly uninteresting life at the moment { c'mon.. who else posts 3 times in a night? } I moved from my semi-native home of Eielson AFB, Alaska about two years ago to the one-streetlighted town of Podot, USA.. middle of the midwest.. yay for me.. Anywho though, since moving to this wee little town (Podot is the kind of place that, if you sneezed while driving, you'd pass it up completely) I've not only found a more cynical, sarcastic side to my otherwise outgoing personality (hence the title 'Ultimate Cynic Woman'... bow in homage.. kidding.. if you want to though, yay! I have more victims... er.. followers.. hehe..) but also joined my town's Winterguard Troupe *yes, you people out there.. I'm still a lowly highschooler* and found an absolutely amazing man.. we shall call him Mistah J, master of spider squishing for his uber-aracnaphobic girlfriend, and keeper of all things squishy.. (Mr. J will do though) thus far he hasnt run screaming for the cornfeilds yet, and has stuck around for a whopping four and a half months.. (I said it was the midwest... we dont have hills.. just cornfeilds.. its sad) Besides all that, superficially speaking, I'm a pretty average chick *with exception to my height*.. I come in at a rather petite 4'11", with blue/green eyes and ever-changing reddish hair (that reminds me- note to self- dye hair.. again..)  Moving on to the key subject of my entry today- Mr. J-  ((sighs))  Simply put, he said he got off work at 4pm... it's 11:05pm.... we usually meet up after he gets off work because he tends spend his daytime hours working on his car and flipping burgers at the local McDonalds *dont worry- just a temporary job.. he plans on going into aeronautical mechanics.. yes, we're  both  in high school... gasp..* and I tend to spend my daytime hours bumming around the house and hoping a job will miraculously fall into my lap.. (hey, atleast I'm kinda looking.. ish..not really..) In any case though, we meet up and talk to one another during the few hours we can actually be together... end of work till about midnightish... unfortunately though, he's not here... and instead of talking to him, I'm on Blog babbling about him not being here.. again... yes, I am odd.. and have probably irritated you all ((maniacal laugh)) ahem.. sorry.. In any case though, I have to be hopping... perhaps he'll decide to come over... perhaps..  here's to wishing  ~Megs the odd Irish chick who is insanely odd when alone at night..
