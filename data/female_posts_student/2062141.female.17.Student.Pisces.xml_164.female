I've been busy everyday and I'm getting very burnt out, which is surprising cause I usually think that I always like to be busy. On Monday the usual gang came over... No one was in the best of mood so I'm not sure why we bothered... well Charlotte slept over and I really needed that... Char you're the best friend ever. Blah... I feel like I'm under a cloud... I must have some inferiority complex to think that everyone else but me has the right to act for themselves and not care what they say to people or how they make them feel.... but if i do, i feel incredibly guilty and feel like everyone must immediately hate me. But I never think anyone else has to feel that way. What's wrong with me. I'm not sure what I did to not have the same priveleges... Oh i remember it's because I'm a pushover. I remember now why I never confront anyone with anything. I'm very bad at conveying how I feel and it makes it worse when they don't try to stop and think of what I'm trying to say... I can't stand people I love being at all upset with me and somehow anytime I have anything of gravity to say it just backfires... so... I'll just stick with dealing with my own problems as always. It's not worth this. There's a lot more I could say that I'd like to but I've learned that sharing your feelings only makes people you love mad at you if it's not what they want to hear. But I will say one thing...for whatever reason that I can't even think of, I'm sorry and I love you all
