And I think that is a great idea because I would love it if her and Mark went out!  Tomorrow at school when I see Lori I'm going to jump on her and give her such a great big hug because I love her so much!  We are going to have a pool party on Sunday if weather permits!  And I talked to Gaylen about having his band play, and yeah ... I'm really excited!  It is going to be so much fun!
