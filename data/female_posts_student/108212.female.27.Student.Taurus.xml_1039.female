I've giving my sensitive side a chance to watch chick movies lately.  By the way Ching, I have found this  program that makes a "back-up" copy of your DVD's.  Its called DVD X Copy Xpress.  I think  urlLink TheScreenSavers  did a review of it last month.  I downloaded a trial version and it does the job.  I have a copy of a DVD that I can pretty much do what I please.  Some bits had to be trimmed like the special features but the full movie is there and I guess thats what matters when you want digital quality movies.  I better stop this is starting this post is starting to become a Blog Zine report... Cheers!
