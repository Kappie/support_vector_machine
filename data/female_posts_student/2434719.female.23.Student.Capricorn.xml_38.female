GUILT FREE.  now that, to me, is the ultimate goal. some girls day dream about love. and don't get me wrong, being a single girl at 23 who's favorite shows list includes sex and the city, i day dream constantly about that great compatable mate... the one who will spend the latter part of his evening reading great books in bed before he sleeps. tv has ruined my chances at real life.  nobody does that but me, i think... well me and the parents on the brady bunch.  so i lean over and turn off the lamp every night...   well wait, what happens if i meet someone great and he hates to read? and every night i try to read but he wants a tv in the bedroom. EW. EW.  i will never have a tv in my bedroom. how unromantic.  ugh.  i'm already pissed at him for ruining my book/life.   my drama make me chuckle. i hope you are too :) and with that i say goodnight.  sweet dreams
