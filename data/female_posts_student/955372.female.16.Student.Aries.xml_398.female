I would also like to add that it went down about two inches in the time it took me to get home. The hairdresser was like "do you want hairspray in it" i was like "LIKE HELL I DO" she like curled it or something to hugen it, after i post this i will immediately be washing my hair and ridding it of the scariness. When she first like showed me what she did, i looked exactly like peg bundy, i kid you not. PLEASE let washing my hair take out the bigness/mulletiness (which it looks like now that i tried to straighten it)/peg bundy-eskness.
