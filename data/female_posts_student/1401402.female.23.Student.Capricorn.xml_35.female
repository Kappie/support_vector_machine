Lol, I get to have as many lap dances as I wish. There were seven of us (all gals), sorry I don't remember everyone's name.    Club Whisper was where we had to meet in order to get on the bus. Once we got there, there was another bachelorette party and a birthday party. No one cute, a whole bunch of bean heads (their with the b-day boi). Tried to flirt and sweet talk but I didn't buy it.    The cool thing about the party bus was that we get to stop by four different clubs. Here's our destination;   The first stop - Sky lounge 10 - 10:15 pm. Desiree and I cut out to the liquor store while everyone else went inside the club to party. I, of course got myself a bottle of Remy and Des got herself a bottle of Jack Daniels. We drank on the bus, everyone came back on the bus within 15 minutes.  It was only 10 o' clock; the club was dead so we left.    The second stop - Snow Drip 10:20 - 11:30pm Damn man, nuthang but a whole bunch of white people!!! Where are all the hot fine Asian guys at??? We stay in the hip hop room. Seven girls, dancing in a circle which caught a lot of attention.  I was being checked out for a while. Damn what a good impression, I haven't been checked out since forever. I was approach! I didn't know what to say or do. I was there to have a great time so I dance along with the stranger. Somehow I didn't feel connected with this guy. His very cute; body build; tall; looks like a player to me. Dude was being so aggressive with me. That cheap scape. I took off to the disco room and it was time to go anyways. (Club was wacky)!   The third stop – Velvet 11:40 – 1:10 This club was poppin! I had a great feeling about this club that I will have a marvelous time. I like this club, I really do! The music was good, hip hop of course. I was buzzin by then. At this point I need a cute guy to dance with but no where to be found. I wasn’t desperate but was getting sick and tired of dancing with the girls in circles.   We left the club on the dot and waited for everyone else on the bus. I must say that we’re always the early birds. Seven girls dancing on the bus we’ve all became very wild and sexy appealing. An Asian dude approaches me. Wow oh my gosh, shesh he was a real cutie. Who strip for me in exchanging for my number.  Lol, I was drunk! Gave him my work number without the area code and no extension. Wow, very smart of you Sakdary!!! You blew it. He lifts me up and wanted to take me away with him but it was time to leave. It was a very nice time chatting with a cutie tho.   The fourth stop – Polyester - 1:20 – 2:00 This fuckin club sucks all they play was the oldies, 70’s, 80’s, disco and Elvis’s songs. It was boo boo and my buzzin began come down. I sat there, so ready to go home. I was tired!!! Party’s over for the night.
