We called our phones "Panty" and the food "Utang" (LT: loan? I'm not really sure) It was funny hearing my room mates casually going : "Ria, can I borrow your panty?" or "Ria, there's a name on your panty!" (meaning I just got a text message) It was so bad and yet so hilarious! XD The place was wonderful too. It had a nice abiance surrounding it, and it wasn't that noisy (except for the roosters outside our rooms and our own noise.)  The food was good too. They fed us 6 times a day for krissakes! And after our snacks, they let us have a siesta/nap. Suuuper fattening activities. Lol.  Our proctors, Brother Paulo and Brother Bernard, were wonderfully gay. n_n And when I say gay, I mean it both ways, even tho they're both straight. :D It was so much fun listening to them and watching them. But Brother Bernard's life story is so sad. n_n;; Most of my classmates cried. Yeah...  The Retreat turned out waaaay better than I expected, and I feel really lucky.  --------  After the retreat, I went to Lillia's house to work on a project, then I went to Gela's house.  --------  I went to the J Cheering Competition last Saturday with Gela and co. after sleeping over at her house. We got to play the Sims : Making Magic. I've got to buy that CD and install it without Jeth.. :P I fell asleep too much.. n_n;; I practically beat the purpose of the sleepover. Lol.   Anyway, we got at the Ultra Colesseum the next morning a bit later than expected, but it didn't start until an hour or so later... ugh, talk about Filipino Time.. As we were going in, we were given this kick-ass cute-ass halos. :3 We got the best seats because our school was right above the judges so we got the best view. Then it started..and then we saw Miriam College's cheer. I got scared. Honestly in my opinion, it was good. But then they copied some of our stuff, (I heard they even used our school cheer during the elims) and I couldn't help but jeer. Hah. At the end of their showy performance, we found out that they didn't have saftey marshals for their wild moves(like throwing cheerleaders all over the place), and it was a big downer for them and a big upper for us. :D (I'm bias. So sue me.) Then we performed. And I screamed, yelled and cheered at the top of my lungs while snapping pictures for our newsletter. And I absolutely loved it. :P I was just shoving it in MC's face. Or at least I saw it like that. Lol. In the end, SSA (School of Saint Anthony), last year's Champions got first place again. It hurt a bit, but they were really good. Plus, they weren't copy-cats. (I can't think of a better term. n_n;;) We got First Runner Up and MC got Second Runner Up. Afterwards, we sat on this legde-like thing that was on the corner of Ultra. Because of our halos, everyone passing by knew we were SHSians. (I heard another school wanted to steal our halos. 0_o) It was so cool sitting there because all the other students of the schools that joined congradulated us. Even those in the buses passing by made a 'C' with their hands. n_n;; St. Mary's even chanted "Holy! Holy!" as their bus passed by. Miriam on the other hand closed their curtains. n_n;;; I'm really glad we went.  Afterwards, we ate at Kamameshi House. We started telling those wierd brain-teaser like things and even the staff ended up listening in. 'Twas kick-ass I tell you. n_n  Then I went home, and slept like a rock.
