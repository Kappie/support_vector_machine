It happens once in a hundred and twenty years.  I didn’t catch it though, you need a good telescope and a good filter. And we don’t have that so too bad.  But its cool, yeh? I mean, hey, something like this only happens twice (the other is in 2012, 8 years from now) in 120 years. And you’ve living now. Hehehehe.  God is just so cool. I wonder if He saw it. I bet He wouldn’t have needed a telescope.   -Mary-Ruth
