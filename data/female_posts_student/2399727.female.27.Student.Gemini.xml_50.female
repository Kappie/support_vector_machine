There are the obvious sacrifices (no meat on Fridays, full fasting on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, almsgiving and a trip to the confessional - my, how I need that one!) but I like to do something else on a daily basis to remember why we're celebrating this season.    When you're a kid, you give things up in a competitive way.  One year I gave up chips and I almost died.  Another year was chocolate.  They recommend as an adult to do something extra rather than take things away, like pray more or be more charitable.  I tried charity one year and I was so bad by the end of Ash Wednesday I more or less gave it up right then and there.  I bought a  urlLink Little Black Book  from the  urlLink Diocese of Saginaw  that I find very helpful.    urlLink Fr. Pat  always gave me his copy since he couldn't read it, with the promise that I would share with him everything that I found really helpful or interesting.   urlLink The Basilians  order one for each Father -- a Little Black Book for Lent, a Little White Book for the Easter Season and a Little Blue Book for Advent.    I also like the Development and Peace Lenten Calendars because the daily monetary donations add up to a nice gift for the 4th Sunday Share Lent collection.  The new  urlLink interactive  one is pretty cool.  This year's focus is on sharing water resources and equality.  Some other ideas I'm tossing around:  urlLink Simple Life 's Calendar online  urlLink Disciples Now  Calendar (if they update it to 2004!) The  urlLink Hunger Site  Online (one click a day = a cup of food!) An  urlLink Online Retreat , since I won't be able to take a real retreat this spring.  I recall last year doing the  urlLink Stations of the Cross  each Friday.  That would be a nice thing to do again.    Lots of options!  I'll have to give this some thought before Wednesday.  I almost always let Lent creep up on me unnoticed and then make a quick, often ill-considered choice on Ash Wednesday.  Not this year.   More to come...
