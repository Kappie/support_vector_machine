That and Hawaiian music (ahhh, the euphonious music of Iz) can calm you even in your most terrible mood! I've been in a good mood today, so it just mellowed me out even more... hmmm, mellow - makes me think I've been doing too much pot. oops =-0    Well, hebedebehdehebeedede (lol, I can't even type it, let alone imitate it) that's all, folks!
