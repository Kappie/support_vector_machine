He always thought he was better than other people, and so proud of himself because he had the car, and the girl and all the friends. Its sad that he doesn't have any of that now. I felt for him, you know, I really did. And I tried to talk to him. But it just made me realize how much of a bastard he really is. And, apparently so have his friends. Since well, he doesn't have any. I'm done with it now though, he can do whatever he wants, whoever he wants and just screw up his life all he wants. I really don't care this time. Life is going great right now, me and Kerry are doing wonderful. Hes going through some tough times with his life and different things I can't really talk about, but between the two of us we're wonderful. Since we've been together, there is probably 4 nights that either of us haven't spent the night with the other, and we aren't getting tired of each other by any means. I realize we just started, and we might before to long, but I'm not thinking about that kind of thing right now. The only time I get upset is when I contact him, like today. I thought I would be nice and contact him, but apparently that was too much for him to handle. I think he thinks to hard about things, and maybe doesn't know what choice he should make, so he makes the one that hurts him the most? At least, thats what it seems like to me. But like I said, it really doesn't matter. I know what its like to not have any friends, and well, its very hard to get through life like that...so I hope everything works out for him in the end. It doesn't look to good now, but it will be better after a while. It always does.   I guess thats all I have to say for now, I'll write more later, now that I don't feel bad about writing about the good things I have going on in my life!
