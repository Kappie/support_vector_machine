Some of the songs have a jazzy feel, but they all have a driving rock beat. They're great songs for when you're happy and feel like singing along loudly. A more mellow song on the album "Shiver" is really good also. The cd is around 15 bucks and has 13 (?) songs on it. It's a great cd!!!!  Out of 5 Stars: ****
