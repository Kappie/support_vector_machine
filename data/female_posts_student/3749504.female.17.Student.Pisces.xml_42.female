I read through surveys I filled out, with answers I would never write in now, through my thing with Brian to the Labyrinth community to...growing closer to my best friend. I wrote about my brother's rotten actions, meeting Patrick, and the time when Amanda almost died and I spent the night crying. I told readers about the concerts, the parties, the friends...about Derek's hurtful comments, more job interviews, karaoke at Alysia's which led to the Allmighty Water Fight between us and the guys.  I talked about Adrian, whom Bobert was deathly jealous of. Wrote of watching Insomniac Music Theater on VH1 until the wee hours of the morning. Watching the stars and clouds float by with a light zephyr tickling my nose while on the cement of our newly started second garage. And my insomniac issues last year...and all of the games I played with other people on AIM. Hey, they deserved it. I started writing less and less as my junior year flied by...  And finally, near the time when I stopped writing...one of the last things I wrote about was my friendship with Zach and how we grew closer and closer, and started to love each other.  I can tell you that Bobert did not like that.
