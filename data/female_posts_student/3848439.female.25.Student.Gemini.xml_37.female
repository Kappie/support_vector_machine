(caution Audio)  Y'all wussy Northerners don't know the meaning of greasy.  The beloved  urlLink Beacon Drive-In  once had a sign saying "We fry with 100% Vegetable Oil!"  Apparently this was a vast health improvement over the previous lard.  Should you ever eat there, I highly suggest the Hash-A-Plenty plate.  Also, the Beacon has an ice cream sundae with 10 scoops the size of softballs.  This is the aptly named "Pig's Dinner."  According to forklore, should a person be able to consume a Pig's Dinner in one sitting, they get the prize of  ...drumroll please...  A fried apple pie!  Wow, I'm getting hungry again
