This girl you been tellin' me about was your first love. And no matter what you do, she'll stay with you forever..."    As the saying goes, "First love never dies." That's true, of course. When you fall in love the first time in your life, you'll love that person so much because its the first time you'll experience how it feels to love and be loved.  For me, I don't know if I've felt this before but it's really hard to forget that person I first liked. Until now, I still like him. I really can't forget him.  yuck! what the heck am i saying?  Anyways, this guy isn't cute  parang ako lang nacu-cutan sa kanya  he's so funny  that's what everyone likes about him i think  but he's annoying  some people just don't like that attitude of his  he's smart  of course!  i really don't want to describe him coz other people might know who he is.  dont want him to know it  Getting back, the memories of the first love just doesn't want to die unless there's a closure between the two people involved.    wala na ko ma-say, wala naman kasi akong experience eh...share nalang kayo....
