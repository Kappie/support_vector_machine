Forget him when they played ur song, remember that u cried all night long. Forget how close u two once were, remember he has chosen her. Forget the things he use to say, remember he has gone away. Forget his laugh, Forget his grin, Forget the dimples on his chin. Forget the way he held you tight, remember he`s wit her tonight. Forget the time that went so fast, Forget the love that move it`s past. Forget he say he`d leave u never, remember now, he`s gone 4-ever.
