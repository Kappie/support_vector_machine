Listing them all was so hard, but gosh darnit, I did it! That was great. Front and back. WHO ROCKS??? You better come up with good stuff for mine or I'll beat you up! So yeah.  The seniors' last full day is tomorrow, then they have a half day, then on Thursday they graduate. It's gonna be so weird without them! Lol now WE can chill in the Senior Lounge. Heh. Alex Davis told me his 'secret' today, I'm almost sad that I already knew but it was cool that he opened up to me. I think him and Carrie should come to my BBQ too, the more the merrier, right? They're cool kids.  It is weird though that all the seniors are leaving. Journalism is gonna be emPTY. My senior homies! Uhoh I'm gonna be counselor, therapist, shoulder to cry on, and comic relief for Charlotte in the next couple weeks. Hehe. NO SWEAT BUDDY. Cause.... I'LL BE THEEEERRRRRRRREEEE... IIII'LLL BE THEERRRRRRRRREE, WHENEVER YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE THEEERRRRRE. Heh... ew I have to go to Mallorie's symphony concert that will probably go til like 10. GA. SO MUCH TO DO SO MUCH TO SAY SO MUCH TO SAY
