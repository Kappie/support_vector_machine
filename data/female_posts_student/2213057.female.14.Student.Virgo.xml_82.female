I should try writting an online test application at 1 am in my underwear   urlLink  Take the Geek Test at fuali.com    lol! this is sooooooo funny! gonna do another one. I am 51% Emo  urlLink    Well.. I've made the cut!  Now I'll go buy some promise rings and knit myself a sweater.   urlLink  Take the Emo Test at fuali.com    this one sucked a bit. by the way, the stuff they write underneath is shit they write not me. i have clothes on not in my underwear, no worries, lol. I am 45% Punk Rock  urlLink    Well, I may know what punk is, but... Okay maybe some people think I am punk, but is that enough? Nope.   urlLink  Take the Punk Rock Test at fuali.com    okay... gotta do the next one.  I am 33% Goth  urlLink    Goth ny night, normal by day.  Deep in my heart I know I am evil, but not on the company's time. I do need to eat.    urlLink  Take the Goth Test at fuali.com    i'm not frickin goth at all. it's funny cause once spencer accused me of being goth. but i think they're a bit dumb. all that black. and they never smile! I am 65% Ska  urlLink    Well, maybe I'm trying too hard, maybe I'm not trying hard enough. I shouldn't forget my roots, and remember that punk and reggae wouldn't exist without ska.   urlLink  Take the Ska Test at fuali.com    the ska one is bullshit. i like it, but i like other stuff more. NIRVANA fucking rocks... i'm just gonna take the internet addict one and then that's it... if you're still here after my rambunctious test taking, you rock. I am 13% Internet Addict  urlLink    I am amazed that I even found this test.  This is my first time online, isn't it great, I figured out this AOL-thing!  But I don't quite know how to turn the computer off.   urlLink  Take the Internet Addict Test at fuali.com    apparently i'm a dimwit at computers which is not surprising at all, lol. well, buh bye. i hope you enjoy the ridiculous stuff.
