It was the most nauseating smell imaginable. I almost threw up several times. But in the end it was ok, and next week I get to drive this big sit on floor sweeper thing, which is cool. I got paid as well.    One week til campdowne! And I'm not even excited yet, because I don't know what to expect. Anyway, I should go now. No reason why, I have nothing else to do, but I'll go anyway.     Actually, I've had a great idea for a feature:    Who knows what this holiday may bring?  Possibilities:  I will get a girlfirend.    Penmo will get a girlfriend. (this is almost certain, since he tends to pull at jamborees, usually someone who he has no hope of ever seeing again. A weird guy, this one. I'm not intending to pull at an international camp, cos I'll never be able to see them again. This is logic which penmo would do well to consider.)    Dave will get sued for £2000 by an irate farmer.    Penmo will get sued for £2000 by an irate farmer.    I will get shot by an irate farmer. (I tend to have the worst luck around)    Vicky will take up bull fighting while in spain, become a famous matador, and never return.    Bri-y will not get pissed. (Unlikely this one, since my birthday is going to be during the holidays... Oh, and she is unbelievably lightweight, that too.)    Dave will form the Dave Thomson band.    Carly will be allowed back on the computer.    I will stay sober. (no comment)    Penmo will ask every fouteenth girl he meets to put him on a lead and drag him around, and every second guy.(seriously, this could happen)    I could take the record for the longest post.(MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA)    Emily Jayne Harris (that is a very Jane ustin- pride and prejudice-esque name, which is why I keep typing it in full) might actually make herself a profile for blogger.    I will buy some CD's (this is really quite likely)    Dave will eat some chocolate whilst standing upside-down in a bucket    I will get bored of writing what will happen to people I know.    I might have too much time on my hands.    Vicky will pass her driving test.    We will be able to go to see  urlLink Keane  as a driect result (yay!) (I LOVE Keane!)    I will stop witing now. (That is quite likely)
