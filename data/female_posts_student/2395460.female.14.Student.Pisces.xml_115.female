Now   urlLink Bliss Spa  is selling a laser for use on facial skin, the  urlLink Beurer Softlaser Healer . The low-level laser is supposed to stimulate collagen production which helps with wrinkles, scars, and acne. Bliss says this is accomplished through the "right UV rays". I don't know what that means, I thought all UV rays were bad for skin, but some people at the  urlLink YTF! Beauty Report Forum  have reported good results, especially with acne. The Beurer Laser is $219, while the Hairmax is $700. I would think you could run the Beurer across your thinning pate as well, but maybe the "right UV rays" are the kind that kill hair follicles.   The efficacy of lasers has long been debated and the  urlLink latest study  found that lasers had little effect on acne. One session with a big gun like the  urlLink Smoothbeam , which is FDA approved for acne and scars costs about $400, so maybe now is the time to embrace the DIY spirit.
