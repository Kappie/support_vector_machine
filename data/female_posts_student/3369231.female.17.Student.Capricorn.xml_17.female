He has had a stressful week.  He just needs to learn to answer his cell phone every now and then.  :-)   Ahhhhhhh, I have tomorrow off!  Woohoo.  I just may work anyways.. wow, thats pethetic.  A bunch of us are going to lunch tomorrow, probably at Steak and Shake.  Yummmy.  It is me, Jessica, Squeaky, Todd, and maybe Robby.  I know that Squeaky is a weird name, but that is what I call him.. cause one day he put a "I Squeak" sticker on his nametag from the pets isle and a "1/2 ton of yanking fun" sticker on... so now I call Michael "Squeaky".  Good stuff huh.   Since I am rambling on and all....
