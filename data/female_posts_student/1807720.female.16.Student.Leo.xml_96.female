It hurts when you know how much effort you put in and I just don't get anything out of it.  I can't take it.  It hurts and upsets me soooo much.  Thank God I don't have a gun right now, I would have pulled the trigger for sure.  Like I went to tutorials, asked her like a million questions, studied like a million nights, did all my homework....EVERYTHING.  Why can't I do good?!?  I don't get it...I mean what else am I suppose to do??????????  I want to die right now.  I just want to die cause everything I do is never good enough.  Everything I try and so things they just never work out.  How can I suck so much at Chem, WHY?  I dream nights and days of being a science teacher.  How though, just HOW can I do it if I can't even do good in high school chem.  All I could do is cry and wonder about the future and wonder about now.  Will things turn out, I can't give up my dream right now.  I just can't.  If I gave up my dream then I might as well give up my life too.  Some times things just aren't fair are they.  In fact, no damn thing is fair and that makes me sooooo mad.
