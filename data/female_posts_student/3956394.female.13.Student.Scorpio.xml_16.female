Hes not going to like EVERYTHING that you like, hes not going to be with you EVERYTIME you want him to be and your not going to find your PERFECT match in one day.What about if he kisses you? Emails you? Makes you happy? Well think about this.What does a kiss mean? A peck of slobber on your face or lips? Thats why parents dont want you going out and being with someone.They are scared of you being hurt or they know you chose the wrong guy.After your parents tell you to dump the wrong guy, why would you look for another? Do you really think your parents are going to approve of him after you just went out with a punk or goth? Well, all im trying to say is dont except your perfect guy to arrive in 1 day.Wait months, maybe even years.Maybe even when your 42, thats when he'll come along.What i think would be the best guy for you is a guy of your religion or language.This is for the girl .. and you know who you are.And i dont care if you think that what i wrote is crap.You think its crap because you didnt think about it..
