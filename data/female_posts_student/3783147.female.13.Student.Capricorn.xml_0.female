So we got there and we put up the tents and We made smores and so we all sat around the campfire untill we went to bed. so then when we got into our tent i guess we were all too excited about camping bcuz we couldnt go to sleep and we were screaming bcuz someone let a dragonfly into the tent!! and then mary was scared of the trees and told kianna to distract them!! lol!! So finally we all got to sleep. so the next day we all went to the beach and swam and ran around and took funny pictures by the brick wall and plucked our hairs!! lol!! so then we had to be back for lunch at 1 and so then we ate and then me melea and mary wanted to go horse back riding but we didnt get to go so then we went to the beach again and me jimmy and josh tanned out in the sun!! lol where else lol! then we went back for supper and we had corn and hamburgers and watermelon and so here comes the funny!! After we were done w/ the corn we gave it to our nieghbors and they start eating it and Rachel Brewer turns to Jordan and says "Jordan they are eating the corn." And Jordan says "OMG really they werent supposed to?" so that was the big funny!! And blah blah blah the weekend is over haha!! So then on Monday Guess what i sat around untill like around six and then i went to West Milton and hung out w/ Shelby so that was my highlight of the week lol!! then tuesdayi had vocal lessons and then wednesday i went to kiannas party and the thursday amanda left and then friday which is today Eric!! and mary left for florida and i went to see the Village and it is fing scary than crap but it is funny too so it isnt that bad everybody thinks it is sooo scary from the commercials but really it is a story of a village and they are scared of the creatures and two ppl fall in love and then the guy gets stabbed by the mentally disabled guy and so the girl goes to the town and gets medicine but she is blind and she has to go through the forbidden forest to get there!! So yay go see it!! NOW!!   Jess!
