There was a person in the row next to us. He looked pretty average. Short brown hair. Two earrings in his left year..he was wearing a white t-shirt, a baseball cap, and khaki shorts. But something was different about him. In stead of standing in "reverent" stillness he was dancing. Not just swaying the the beat, he was really dancing. He was jumping up and down, swaying his arms, and singing as loud as his vocal chords could muster.  At first no one seemed to notice. But, one by one, people started staring. Some even glared.  This should not be something unusual at church. Church should be a play to go crazy for God. Not a place to stand still, a place to dance for joy. Not a place to glare or stare, a place to welcome everyone into the family of God.   This is what drives me crazy.  People go to church and judge everyone.   The church is not a place to judge, the church is a place to welcome.  Not just the people you would feel comfortable around...EVERYONE!
