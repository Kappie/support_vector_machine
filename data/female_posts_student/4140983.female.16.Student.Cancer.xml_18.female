Even though she DID, because we can't count math, ALL second halfers have to do math. So instead of just accepting our choices, Ms. Roberts made us draw for World History and Art History. I'm in World and Chem, I was in Art and Chem. I WANT Art. Rebecca got Art, which was her second, but we're going to talk to Ms. Roberts. Maybe she'll let us switch? She said over the weekend that she would cement us into our assignments, but maybe she'll let us switch? Then Becca and I would both have our first choices. Matt Jones REALLY wants World, and instead, he's in Bio and Physics, so basically, he switched with Rebecca. I feel so bad for him. I wish we could just keep what we decided on. The first half has six people, so one gets cut but they won't know who until too late. So they have to split up subjects so that they'll be OK when that person drops. Ha, all the second half people get to play. Oh, and for other people's benefits: First and Second halves have nothing to do with intelligence or capability. First half is more English and history, second half is more science and math. But I'm fine in second half, because it's a lot less vocabulary.  My nails are so long. I've had my nail polish on for about a week and it hasn't chipped or anything. Everyone's making fun of me for having pink nail polish. Just because I don't want to wear pink anymore doesn't mean I can't have pink nails. I'm just sick of wearing exactly the same things. I mean, I'll wear the same things, but they have to be the DIFFERENT same things. So I'm going shopping tomorrow...  I'm getting sick of Guard and spinning. Seriously, it's getting bitchy, and I'm starting to go, "I have to SPIN today?!" At least during Early Week, we got to socialize more and change from thing to thing, we weren't always spinning. Oh, Peggy gave me her flag to sew. Evil.  In physics, we had to build the highest tower out of one sheet of paper and 30 cm of tape. One group used tripods, a lot of other groups used bases and built up out from it. Chris and I had the coolest design, we built paper arches and crossed them over each other. It was stable, but it didn't get very high. It looked AWESOME. He kept referring to ours as "artsy". Oh, and at lunch, I couldn't find Monica or Jenny, and I stood in a circle with the guy equivalent of our group and talked with them, it was awesome. Then everyone else joined us and we decided that Oprah is the newest insult. "Skank." "Bitch." "Whore." "Oprah." "OH NO YOU DIDN'T." We have great fun being...well, stupid.  Oh, and I refuse to let my secret determine how I feel all day. I was sad like ALL DAY because of it.  I need new music. Recommendations neccessary.
