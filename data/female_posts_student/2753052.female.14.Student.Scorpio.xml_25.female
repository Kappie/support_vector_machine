I really not mean, his big girlfriend with big boobs jumped on me the other dayat the carnival =( I didn't do a thing either. Boys suck, we need more men in the world. *nods*      Sorry you had to get shots =( I don't like them either. Also we can share simon's lap if you want though our combined weight will probably exceed 200 lbs and kill him=*(Wellllll ppls time to go sit on my butt and watch hours of tv. This is such a productive night.       Buh bais!!!
