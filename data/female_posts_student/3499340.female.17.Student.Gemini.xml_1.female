I e-mailed my friend. I hope he found a house. He was staying at his friend's for a while, but he was going to have to leave.  I should probably also e-mail my prom date. I hope he got back from my friend's okay. My friend's brother and his friends were hilarious. It's the perfect anti-drug ad, really. I've never gotten stoned, and I really have no desire to do so. I've seen what they do to my friends, and I just don't want to have to deal with all of that for a high that can't even be that great, in my opinion. Just give me a driving musical beat to release the chemicals in my brain, and I'm cool.  I must go, now. Feel free to play with the hummingbird. Namaste.
