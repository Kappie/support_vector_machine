It was she who promised us the most. And let us down the most too. What A1 for O's. When she isn't here for us? Sage is bad enough. I really appreciate she put me out of Sage.  Then to Parsley. With Ms Leong. Now she dropped a bombshell. "There's a very high possiblity that I won't be teaching Parsley anymore." What she said this morning.  She'd be teaching Sec4s.  What crap.  I'm disillusioned.   ETA:   Calmed down quite a bit... =) Didn't expect an outburst myself. But I'm really very disillusioned. I hope no more teachers will start telling us they'd be going. Not until we graduate.  Went for CIP today, as said yesterday. Funny experience plucking mushrooms off the logs. Ms Leong and Mrs Chang were sitting there talking while we  fooled  did some gardening. =) Then came home, totally xiasway because Ms Wong was waiting in school for me for like half an hour. Didn't turn out very bad though, after she told me she came to school to settle some stuff on her table. Then we made a trip up her table. Haha. It's now very clean and tidy. So I asked:   Me: How long did you wait for? Her: Erm, about 2 hours. I cleared papers, took out unwanted folders, cleared computer folders, and cleaned up the table; went down to the canteen to buy sweets [*She points to her container*] and waited in the car. Me: [*Aghast*] Then you should've SMS-ed me and tell me to go home by myself!!! Her: Well. I felt it was okay doing this. =)   She gave me a toothy grin. Hahahahahhahahahha. Cute. =) So after that we got home, she stayed for a while, then had to go out for a school function, and then Jiaqi called to ask if I wanted to go down to Toro's autograph session. So I pia-ed to the MRT station, then her father drove us there... In the end, I left even before Toro came. Laughs. Jiaqi had Ame there too so it's okay. Besides I don't like to squeeze with people. =)  I'm off to revise a little for chinese (express)! =)
