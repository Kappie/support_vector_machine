First I went to the high school to drop off my senior picture junk and fix my schedule. Its so random: 1. English- Kaicher 2. Calculus- Freifelder 3. Gym (with the love of my life, Amy.) 4. Human Bio- Kuplin (Again with Amy.) 5. Lunch (With Erica, Natch, Dan Rist, and Nicoley Oley Bonilly. Excellent I say.) 6. Italian- Haddeland (was physics but fuck that) 7. Photo Major- Roppolo 8. Spanish AP- Galati (with Alyson, and such.)  Pretty decent senior year, I'd say. I'm not slacking off or anything this time around.  So anywho, then I drove to Dairy Queen so my boss could make me some lunch and to get some ice cream for Steve. And a Coke because I needed caffiene, hardcore. I should have just gotten some Bawls, dammit.   After that I delivered ice cream to Steve, then went to Mike's house to drop off his sunglasses. :( They'll come back to me someday, mwahaha. Then I found James' house and then almost hit a dog. Then I wont home and then decided I needed to get gas to cover up all of the aimless driving I did. Then I talked to Amy on the telephono, and I just remembered I was supposed to call her back, and then I looked at the time and realized, fuck I have to shower and get ready for work now.  So goodbye for now, blog viewers.
