I went for a bike-ride today to clear my mind and rode right passed a snake. Holy shit I was scared. M'kay so approximitely 3.5 days left of school and I am only going to 2.5 of them. The Parade Of States was a total bore. One good thing about high school being 'we go from The Parade Of States to Battle Of The Bands.' Oh yeah.   Phrase of the day: "So, basically punks are like theifs of style?" -Ashley replied to my point about punks  Song Of The Day: Emotionless By Good Charlotte  Even Of The Day: The whole snake thing
