I swear I'm writing the same stuff I have been all year, but these TAs this quarter have been really nitpicky over stupid details. And the teachers have been unclear and inconsistent with what they want from us. I hate this stupid TA in TransMississippi West, he marks me down for the lamest things, and I feel like I wrote a clear and well written essay, and he picks out these lame details that I didn't mention enough. I can't write about everything, I have to pick and choose, we only have an hour for chrissakes! I hate getting a B when I felt like I wrote a good essay, and I felt good about what I wrote and what I knew. It's so fucking arbitrary, it makes me sick. Maybe next time I'll just ramble on about who knows what and I'll get an A. It works for other people. God I'm pissed.
