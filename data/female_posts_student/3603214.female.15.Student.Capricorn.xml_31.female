I decided that my dad can be an ok guy. He's just incapable of being a family man. I don't see him as a father anymore, just as like that goofy uncle. That's slightly depressing, but I've never really had a goofy uncle, so I'd like to think that the good sides of my dad would be that kind of figure. Anyway. Show Me St. Louis kicked ass. On our way over there,Mike followed the whole way. It was me, Alicia, and Abbye in the car *FYI, Did you know that Alicia is Mrs. Laswell's daughter? DUN DUN DUN! We all actually get along. I've seen the good side of Sharon. Scarrrrry?? lol* Anywho, we were waving to him on the highway and whatnot. And we were like, Let's give him the loser sign! So we did and he gave us the finger. That was kinda funny since he's Jesus. So we keep truckin, he tries to pass us, but my dad sped up. He gave us a look of anger/despair. We also caught him jammin to whatever was on the radio. He pulled up next to us in STL. I tried to blast Bohemian Rhapsody, but we were too late *damn the luck* We found an ice cream stand thing so the 4 of us waltzed over to the window w/ our melting ice cream at hand, jealousy written all over the others' faces. Even the little Wizard of Oz kids who stole the show from us. So it was fun. When the WOO ppl sang, we started a chorus of Day by Day to drown them out. It worked wonderfully...temporarily lol. During commercial breaks we jammed and made fun of the WOO ppl. I felt like Tour Guide Barbie. I might have looked perky on TV but once the cameras were off, I looked like I was pissed off at someone/something. So the show was over, and we went off on our merry way. We followed Mike and his partner in crime Chase to the crosswalk and I told Mike that he was going to hell for giving us an obscene finger gesture. Across from his truck he yelled O NO! They better not have given me a ticket! Sho nuff, there on his windshield was a ticket for not parking right or something even though he was parked the same as the surrounding vehicles. That was freakin hilarious! Loren told him to take it up w/ his Father. Haha, get it? He's Jesus? God? hehe...soooo. Other than that, nmh. Just rehearsal after rehearsal after rehearsal. If you wanna, get up at about...eh, 6 AM ish and turn on Channel 5 for Today in St. Louis and you can see either "I Just Woke Up, SoGetthe Hell Away From MeAmy" or "Insomniac Amy" not sure which one is gonna make an appearance. Either way, it'll be kinda funny to see me awake in the AM...btw...It's 9 something AM...I must be lonely...Later
