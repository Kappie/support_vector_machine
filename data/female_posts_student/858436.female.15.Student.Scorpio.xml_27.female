"Strange and Beautiful" by Aqualung  I've been watching your world from afar I've been trying to be where you are And I've been secretly falling apart Unseen To me, you're strange and you're beautiful You'd be so perfect with me But you just can't see You turn every head but you don't see me  I'll put a spell on you You fall asleep When I put a spell on you And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see And you'll realise that you love me  Yeah Ye-ah  Sometimes the last thing you want comes in first Sometimes the first thing you want never comes But I know that waiting is all you can do Sometimes  I'll put a spell on you You fall asleep I'll put a spell on you And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see And you'll realise that you love me  I'll put a spell on you You fall asleep Cause I put a spell on you  And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see And you'll realise that you love me, yeah  Yeah Ye-ah Yeah Ye-ah
