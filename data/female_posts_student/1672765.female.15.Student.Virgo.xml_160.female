I feel like my entire state of mind can change by the drop of a pin. I feel like I'm scared something will make me feel low - something bad will happen that'll make me go back in the depressed/irritated mood I've been in for the past few days. But I'm not happy either and I can't see anything happening that would make me happy, just impossible things, or little things that won't make much difference when I've sunk so far down recently.  Now I'm feeling lousy, I think I crossed back into the depressed state I had been in for so long now.  Happy thoughts. I have to think happy thoughts.  Uhm. I don't have a clue. Nothing has really been making me feel good. Nothing feels right.  I don't know. What makes me happy?  Music...I'm listening to music...it's not really helping...it's kind of depressing angry music though...ha...I don't guess that helps...I don't really have much happy music though...I'm not really into that. I have this Christmas mix I made...Christmas is supposed to be happy but it's punk and emo and ska songs...about bad Christmases and stuff. That made me feel better. Ha ha.
