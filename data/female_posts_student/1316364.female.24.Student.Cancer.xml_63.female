Once again Jesse and I are going to be working opposite schedules, he is working when I am not and vise versa. He said he would try to get online a little earlier so we would be able to chat around 8:00 pm tonight. I just wish that they would quit switching his schedule around so much. Just when I get used to it they throw me off by switching his working time.   I guess it would be too much to ask the ARMY to stay consistent with their decision.
