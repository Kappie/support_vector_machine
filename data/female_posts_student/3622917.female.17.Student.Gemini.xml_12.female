So while all my school friends are off at school writing killer exams I will be here at home, either asleep or watching some day time TV. Lovely! I do feel sad that they are stuck there you know, doing really boring stuff. But it is really quite awesome that I don't have to. Good luck to all though. Especially all my best friends. Even though no one is probably reading this cause you all have better things to do with your time but whatever! I am finally on the computer after three when my brother gets home from school. It is much better because there are actually people online. Of course they are all busy what with studying and all but still. They are online and that is what counts.  I need some new friends. Yeah I should work on that. That'll be my plan the next time I am in a social situation. Which is not likely to be soon. Damn I hate this. But no exams. Though also no friends. It appears to be a rather tricky situation. I think I need some advice on this one.
