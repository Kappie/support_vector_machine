Maybe by leaving my bad memories here, i will be able to forget them and get them erased off my mind. By sharing my happy moments here, maybe I will be able to let them sink deep into my heart... Life is short... who knows...     ~A man cannot touch his neighbor's heart with anything less than his own.~
