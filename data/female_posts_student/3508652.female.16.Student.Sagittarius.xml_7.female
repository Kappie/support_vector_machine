And last week was a pretty good week - it was my first week off of school, and it was very relaxing. I just listened to music, talked online, slept in til 11:30... yeah, it was nice. :) Friday I went to see Shrek 2, and that is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Puss in Boots is hilarious! The donkey is funny too, but annoying. My friend went to L.A. this weekend, and I missed him a lot, but he's back now, so I'm really happy! Church today was good... don't have to do anything for the rest of the day, or tomorrow... yay! Oh yeah, soccer on Tuesday... :-/ that reminds me of last week's practices. They were awful!! Actually, Tuesday's wasn't really that bad, it just was for me cuz I was sick. Thursday was brutal - we went up and down the field (I don't know how long it was, but probably like 200 yards, which is two whole soccer fields :-O ) like 12 times, then we had to scrimmage, and if we were caught walking, then we were gonna do sprints, then the trainer got out a rope that we had to jump over, and by that time, my legs were jelly so I had to sit out and stretch for a bit. I felt bad cuz everyone probably thinks I'm a wuss, but I was gonna lose feeling in my legs after a while. So after that, we FINALLY got water, and then we shot for a bit, but it still involved a lot of running. When we had to scrimmage, I wished we could still shoot, cuz I was so tired! Well, I guess I'll end there, and post later!
