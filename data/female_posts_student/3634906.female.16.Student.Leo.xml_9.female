YAY and then we rode the bus back to her house and i got to pull the thing!!! YAY how exciting... hahaha lame-O... anyways and then we played some hardcore nitendo 64 and some presidents and then i came home... just to be here for about a half hour when the tornado sirens go off and have my mom freaking out about us going into the basement... which never happened but there was actually a tornado about 20miles north of us and it hit one of the towns that my parents have their karate centers in so my mom is flipping out because they closed down all entrance into the town and shes worried that the karate center might be hurt (that sounds a little weird) and sadly our power went out and i had to sit around with my older sister and her boyfriend all night... and my little sister slept right through it!! WHAHAHA i wish i would have... it was torture... well anyways i feel like i am extremely boring today so i am just going to go i need sleep because i have to get up tomorrow morning and do pilates at 7am so i need to get a little sleep... over and out -
