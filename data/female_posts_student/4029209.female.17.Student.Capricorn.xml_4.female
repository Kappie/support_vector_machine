So, i have made an effort to ensure i greet her properly, when talking to her 'oo argh!' and call her random things like 'matey'. I think it's important to support our friends, whenever they turn slightly insane, or just decide to have a change, so that we let them know they're not alone. Oo arghh!.  Oo arrgh! one day left :/...
