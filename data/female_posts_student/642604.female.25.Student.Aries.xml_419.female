The guy is no good, he's cheated, told her it's over, cheated again, rinse, lather, repeat... you get the point.  Now, once again he is claiming that this time will be different and once again I can see she is starting to hope and believe him again and once again the girl is gonna get hurt.  Everyone can see it but her.  I know love blinds you, I know you go deaf and dumb as well but it doesn't make it any less painful to watch it happen.
