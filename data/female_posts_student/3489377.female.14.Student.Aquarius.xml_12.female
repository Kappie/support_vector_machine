But the fact that someone reads something of mine, makes me happy. Oh well..In the second week of August, school starts. I'll be a freshman..Whoopie!..Feh Im dreading over it. At least my brother will be there. He is out of town right now. I kinda miss the big jug head around. Im glad he is coming home soon..^_^
