"there's a double meaning behind that." ah, so great. keanu = hot. so anyway. i start spring break this week. i've already had a very good time. mom got me some pimpin coach shoes, in pink, nothing like that oats girl would wear. but still. they're hot. and i finally got to watch "pimp my ride," on MTV. quite possibly one of the greatest shows on the planet. Xzibit comes around to peoples houses and announces that they are going to get a pimped ride. they all have trashy cars and stuff. and they totally add all these sweet rims onto the car and everything. oh man. its awesome. zack, mom, and i went to see agent cody banks today. it wasn't as bad as i thought, but it did drag on much too long. zack thought it was pretty funny though, so it was worth seeing him break out in random shrieks of laughter. anyway, i'd better go to bed. jordan organized my desk last week. the note i got said, " Julia, I don't know what happened, i was playing outside and then my feet marched toward the house. then they carried me upstairs into your room and said, 'hands start working at the desk.' then my hands said, 'yes sir!' so they reached out toward your desk and started working. my eyes looked and watched in amazement as i created this masterpiece. i had gotten into a funky mood. Well, i hope your new desk is suitable. you can check the drawers and stuff but not everything is 'PERFECT.' the colored ready to be burnt CD's are under your desk on top of the CD burner. my list of songs is on the wall above the NEW spot where i put your tape and stapler which is located right of your computer and right in front of your blue stretchy/ flippy light. so you can enjoy your new desk now., Jordie. P.S-- good luck on your exams."  so cheerio then. until next time. book with travelocity. and don't forget your hat. the wondering gnome.
