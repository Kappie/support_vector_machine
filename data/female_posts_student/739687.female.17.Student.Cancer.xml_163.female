Oww Oww...painful pleasure. :)  I wish I had talent. Like, musical talent or something of the sort. Geez, I've always been in love with everything about music since I was like 2 or 3. No kidding. Now if only I'd done so much as acquired a talent for anything involving music. Then I'd be happy. Maybe I should concentrate on that sorta thing. I've decided I wanna learn drums or bass. Preferably drums. Because that would just be so damn great.  Well...what to say.  I've decided to ignore my family from now on. Because I am having a big self-improvements lately, and all they do is drag me down. So, no more of that. I will keep improving, and forget all about them.  When I graduate college, and find a career of interest, I'm moving to somewhere near the equator. I'm thinking to like an island or something. A tropical place. That way I never have to deal with cold, shitty weather. And I have pretty, tropical weather. And everyone thinks that I'm not completely serious, but I am. Really. Because it's the only way I see of me being happy in life. If I have to deal with winter, then I can't do that. Ahh...wouldn't that be wonderful. Nice, tropical weather. God, I love it! I mean, even when the weather is shitty in places like that, it's still great. So moving to somewhere like that. hooray.  I feel productive right now. Hmm...that's really good. Because about an hour ago I felt like rolling over and dying. I think I'm gonna go take another Aleve and then read or study or something. I really shouldn't be taking another Aleve though...I've already had 4 since last night. The limit is like...3 in 24 hours. Eh...what am I supposed to do when they  DON'T WORK!?   Well, off to do something of importance.  See ya at high tides, crazies.
