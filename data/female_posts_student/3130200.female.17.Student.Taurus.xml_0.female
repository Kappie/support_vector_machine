Who would think that three of the shortest and most simple words in the english language are some of the hardest to say. I know that my parents love me, or I know my dad does, but it's hard to feel loved when they never say it. The last time I heard it was when I was in a car accident about a month and a half ago. So, does it take something like that to happen for them to come out and say it? It hurts. Because, their shortcoming has become my shortcoming and I hate it. I wish I could say it, but I don't know how or when. I am always afraid it will come out wrong or sound stupid. I can't wait to have kids so I can smother them with the very thing I want most right now. I am going to be the parent mine never were to me. I am going to make them the center of my universe. My kids will be the one thing I will not screw up...I am making that promise to myself and them right now.
