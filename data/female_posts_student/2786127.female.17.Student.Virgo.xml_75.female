I began to brush my teeth while laying on my bed in my cave like room and thought about how ridiculous getting ready for the day is. If I take a shower, straighten and blowdry my hair, put on makeup it takes me a good hour - hour and a half to get ready every day. to what purpose? Mahh...and then i started to think about little house on the prarie...haha...but seriously. I bet people were so much happier back then, even if their lives did consist of wakeing up everyday and working their butts off. But atleast they felt fullfilled, and had good self esteem. Also though, family relationships were the most important relationships to have back then. Now take all those things, and look at my life. I don't have a job, the most "working" I do is at the gym, i have bad self esteem, and i have little to no family relationships. atleast not good ones. Hmm.  Pointless life, perhaps? Oh well.  Hawaii-3 days  A.C.T's- tommarow (disgusting, i dont want to do them)  off to see the millionth movie i've seen this week.
