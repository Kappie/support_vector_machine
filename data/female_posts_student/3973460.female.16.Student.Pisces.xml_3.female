I'm having problems remembering a lot of things and I've been feeling really weak. My guess is lack of vitamins and protein because all I eat is junk. My mother is getting scared about another issue and wants me to get my blood taken again, I'm sure I'm okay because I was last time, but I'm afraid of what they may do if I'm not. I have to stop being pessimistic, I really do. I feel so guilty venting because I know people have it worse than me, and it makes me feel so incredibly selfish. Yes I really am not as heartless as some of you may think. Here's a weird thought. Most of my friends don't even know the real me. Heck, I don't even know everything about myself. However, one of my friends knows me more than I know myself. It's weird and I'm not sure if this person notices it either. This person has helped me out a lot and I'm sure they don't know how much it means to me, but I really appreciate them. My aunt broughtup college yesterday, and which one I want to go to. I reallywant to go to NYU. If Idon't get in, I really don't know what I willdo! I want to major in journalism and minor in sociology or tv/movie production (doubt that though because tisch schoolis hard as hell to get in). I spent my whole day yesterday looking at the website in complete awe. It would be a dream come true if I got in. Starting a new life in the city. Awesome. Then, I thought it over. Istarted to cry. I do not want to leave my friends when I go to college. I was talking to Tropia last night and shetold me something along the lines of "Our friendships are so strong, I can't imagineus not being friends. I mean, look at all of us on Saturday. There was no awkwardness. That just goes to show how close we all are" That helped a lot, thanks Jen!I wish a guy would walk into my life. I'm the type of girl who doesn't fall for a guy easily. It takes time, and I'm extremely picky. Plus no guys are interested. I just hope I canhave some typeof romance this year. I reallydo. Well, I'll leave you there. Sorry thiswas all over the place, I just had to let a few things out in this blog device thing.
