Oh man I'm gonna miss the seniors so bad...I didn't really remember how much fun we actually had in our classes till I read that.             "There's going to be no Pat to take things the wrong way and get us all to laugh, no Lars to crack stupid jokes, no Celeste to complain so much people tell her to shut up, no James to cringe at Lars' and Pat's off color jokes, and no Megan to laugh so hard she starts to cry. "         Oh man I'm gonna cry again....Those were really good times =/ Definately during vacations we'll be hangin out and stuff guys....
