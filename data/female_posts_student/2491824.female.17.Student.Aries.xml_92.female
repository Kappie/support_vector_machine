I feel like covering my room in drop cloths and painting a huge picture...without using brushes.. just my hands... Mmmmm... :) ..And I actually have an idea for a painting... It's so rare that I have an idea for something... I should probably sketch it out before I forget it...   Maybe sometime this week I'll go to an art store and see how much canvas costs... All I have are those stupid canvas boards. I hate them... ...There's something about painting on canvas which has been stretched by myself that I absolutely love...  I really want to paint...  It's like a hunger...  It's killing me... I need to do it... ....Even if am forced to paint on stupid little canvas boards...   It's 4AM and I have to walk my aunt's dog (which I am dog-sitting for most of the week) in the morning....  Maybe I should sleep... or something...
