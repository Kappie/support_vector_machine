On Sunday, I took the night off and went and just got her away from her house before she really lost it. Her mom tried to make her read his obituary! That's just cruel. We drove all over town and went for coffee and then went to Ryan's. I've never heard a person sob so hard, but I can only imagine how much that would hurt.      Hey Ash, I know you've heard this a million times, and have been let down about 95% of the time, but hear this: I will always be here for you. Always.
