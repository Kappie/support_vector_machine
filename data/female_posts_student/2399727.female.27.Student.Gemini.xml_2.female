I'm 26 (if I were about 20 years younger I'd say I was almost 26 and a half!), I'm a grad student on leave from school, and I'm trying to figure out exactly what to do with my life as I get nearer and nearer to finishing up my higher education.    I like to think of myself as somewhat intelligent, goal-oriented, funny and strong.  Sometimes I don't think of myself in those terms but we can't all be consistent all the time, can we?    Without school, my life is pretty quiet these days.  Lots of television and too much Internet.  Too much online euchre.  I guess I haven't had a break from school in 22 years so this is probably a good time to decompress, though I wish it were for better reasons.    I've had a rough summer.  I went blind on five occasions after complications from what should have been a very simple eye surgery.  I'm still recovering my sight but things are markedly improved from what they were.   I guess that's enough for now.  More to come!
