I stumbled across yet another -  the food blog .  I am no stranger to public blogging; I keep an online journal at LiveJournal. Food diaries are new to me though, and it was at LJ that I first discovered the food blog. I have since come across many fabulous food blogs that have me sitting in front of my computer for hours, completely entranced, as only a true foodie can be. What a wonderful concept!  I have noticed though, that there are very few vegetarian blogs, and I haven't seen any vegan ones outside of LJ. As a long time advocate of vegan cuisine and living a healthy lifestyle - I think I was a Seventh Day Adventist in a previous life - I am disappointed. Where are all the vegetarians and vegans?  My search for vegan blogs continues. When I find them, I will post links so that everyone can enjoy them. In the meantime, I hope you'll stay and visit awhile, have a cup of Earl Grey and a piece of homemade cake ....  in a vegan kitchen .
