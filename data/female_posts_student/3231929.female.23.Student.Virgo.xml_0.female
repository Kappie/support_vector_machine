Not to mention the best bit, I can see my toes wiggle! Yeah, I know it sounds odd, but toes are kind of cool aren't they? Or maybe I've just never grown past that stage (usually of little babies before they can walk) of thinking toes are just brilliant. I could watch them wiggle all day.  OK that's enough strangeness for one night, I'll move my disorganised packing off my bed and climb in. I'm kind of excited that this is my last proper night at home before leaving.
