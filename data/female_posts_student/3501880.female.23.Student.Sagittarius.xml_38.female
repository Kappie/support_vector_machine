I dream of quitting law school and running away to Chicago and having nothing to do with the law at all! N-O-T-H-I-N-G! But alas, my sister talked me back down to reality, and then reaffirmed my fear that my dad would probably never speak to me again! Well, of course he would speak to me again, but it would would probably only be to yell at me.  J.Lo has run off and gotten married...AGAIN! This is really something that I will never understand. At this point, how does J.Lo say her vows with a straight face? Does the minister not even require her to say "I do", but merely requires that she shrug as a sign of affirmance? It really just baffles me. I can see getting perhaps getting married again after divorce, but after my second divore and not having maintained a marriage for longer than two years, I think I would probably hold off just a little bit before I took the plunge again!   I need to go lie down. I am feeling light-headed again...boo!
