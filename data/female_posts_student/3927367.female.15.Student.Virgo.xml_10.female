After that we went to burger king. That was really nice, considering i hadn't had lunch or dinner. After burger king i went home with one of my friends to spend the night, but we didn't go to her house. We actually went to a house that they are house sitting. It was so big and pretty, that and they have a really cute dog. His name is toby, he looks like the ice cream "brown cow", he's a polmeranian, and he only has one eye. He's adorable! He slept next to me and it made me happy. My friend and i talked until 2:30 in the morning. We just sat there and talked. It was the best thing i have done in awhile, and it helped me so much. We pretty much decided that we are gonna make this next school year totally awesome, and i totally hope we have at least two classes together. Dang it. that reminds me, registration is this week. That totally awesome, completely incredible friend that i am talking about, i know you're gonna read this, so do you wanna try and plan a time to go to registration together? I don't really wanna go alone and you know you're gonna be the first one i tell my schedule to, so why not have you right there? Anyways, so yeah, Last night really helped. I feel somewhat refeshed, like i now have the energy, and will, to keep moving forward. I'm not saying things are perfect, because they are far from it, but i can now look at the world and say without fear "Bring it, moron!"
