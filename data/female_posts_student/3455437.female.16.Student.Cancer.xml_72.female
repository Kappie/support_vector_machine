Anyway I hope you all have a fun day with no school YIPPEEE..........I'm probably here all day (going to byron at some point) so feel free to get off your lazy ass and ride over here (yes even you main arm/ palmwoods ppl lol....its an all easy downhill ride...)  P.S Guess who is me and Maya's back up bus driver for Paul?? MARK from firefighting- how funny is that??!!!
