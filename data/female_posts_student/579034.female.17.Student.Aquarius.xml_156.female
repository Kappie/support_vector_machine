It was really sad you guys. Like, she was just ripped from her family. Cancer is such a bitch. And like, her and Billy, her husband, they really loved eachother. Like you know the cupple that can't stand each other and are only together for the sake of their kids? Well Lisa and Billy were like the absolute opposide. They really loved each other. It's like.... they were that couple that were going to go the distance. They were going to make it. And then poor Brooke and Dean, loosin their mom. I mean Brooke's only 14 and Dean's only what, 10 or 9? I just don't want them to come out of this with any complexes or anything. Like some kids when a parent dies stop talkin and some just get angry or spiteful. I really can't see Brooke getting like that but, I don't know so much about Dean. He just seemed to be existing. Like, there was someone home but the lights weren't on. I just hope God blesses them. Rest in peace Lisa, I'm sorry I didn't know you better, but I'm totally glad I knew you in the frist place.  Staten Island Champs yesterday. It was a really good day for me, times were bad, but places were good. We came in 4th overall, Right behing Tottenville and Tech. We made finals in the 4x100 and then in the finals we came in 5th, then I was on the B team 4x400 cause my times have been really sucking lately and coach doesn't need me anymore, but we sunck in for 6th. I was so happy, we were in 7th place and I passed a girl from Tech. I was so happy you have no idea. I felt like I accomplished something even though my time was 68.9 But... oh well... I mean there are still more meets to go so, I'm confident I'll just bust out... well... I'm hoping I'll bust out... all I'm askin is to hit 66 at least once durin outdoors. That's all.  But yeah... yay for Mick cause he PRed today at his meet. x0x
