I swear I hear you in the whisper of the wind I feel you when the sun is dancing on my skin And when it's raining, you won't find me complaining because  When I think about rain, I think about singing When I think about singing it's a heavenly tune When I think about heaven, then I think about angels When I think about angels, I think about you Jamie O'neal-  When I Think About Rain
