When it's down it looks either a.) extremely eighties b.) extremely country pop star c.) peg bundy-esk d.) fairly seventies or e.) a mixture of the four, which is the worst of all. My hair is not coming out of my ponytail until it grows at least three inches. I'm sorry (well no not really) but you'll just have to deal with not seeing it and trust me that if you saw it you might freeze into stone. And i swear to god if one more person asks/orders me (which i think is quite rude) to take my hair down i swear to god i will eat their eyeballs. Also i would like to officially apologize to Madeline for gang raping her and trying to get her hair down, looks like karma has finally come to get me. And we all know what i say about karma, it's a bitch.
