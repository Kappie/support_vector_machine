Saw his two kids...On the way back home we stopped at Culver's and slept for awhile... then we went to East Town mall. My mom spent $50 on me at Hot Topic. Camo shoelaces, Happy Bunny keychain, Blink-182 t-shirt, Cold t-shirt, and another shirt about the little men behind my eyes :) Plus the shoes she bought me on Sat and the pants, etc. she's going to buy me tonight... It's early school shopping, but still, I'm getting new stuff and Kait isn't. Only b/c my mom's mad at Kait b/c Kait's being a bitch, and she treats all her stuff like shit. Muahahaha!  Trav wants to have sex with Beth... That's just sick. I swear to god I'll kill myself if he somehow shows up at the party this weekend...
