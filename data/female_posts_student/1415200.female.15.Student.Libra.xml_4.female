While I was upset with *insert unmentioned person here*, for stupid reasons now that I look back on it..I was truley afraid, that if I lost our friendship, then who would that  leave me to tell all my problems to, and to give me a hug when I need it. Nobody else really acts like that towards me. I mean yeah, i have a few other friends..but they would judge me. I guess he's just one of the people I need in my life. I was shocked when i thought about it..I thought i was this "Miss Independant" (no pun intended) but I really am not. Im glad I realized it though, because maybe now I wont take the best thins in life for granted anymore.   I really need another episode of Brendan Leonard. . .  Well. I better get outa here..Oh, yeah..i changed my name to rotang because it sounds so much cooler..someone save me*
