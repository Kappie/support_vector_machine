Mrs. Duer got me started on it. 2.)  Why are you staying with Sandy?  That's kind of random.  3.)  When are you going to get around to calling me? :(  Ok, so I could call you if I ever thought about it.    And one final question posed to all BHS kids:  Yall want to go to the library tomorrow and study for this AP US Historyt  test?  Please?  That would be great.  That's all for now.  Except for I missed you at school today, Josh.  But Julian, Rob, and I had LOTS of fun without you. Pthththth!!! (That's me sticking my tongue out at you.  I figure that's a good way to spell it.
