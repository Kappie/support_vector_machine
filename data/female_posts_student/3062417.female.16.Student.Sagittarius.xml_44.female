B-ball and cute guys...what more does a girl need? lol jk The only other thing I need is Dr. Pepper!  Today- School wasn't half bad. I skipped Math. Ooooh what a rebel I am. lol I am so worried about solo fest. I'm not even close to ready and it's in a week and a half! AHH!  Other than that crap, nothings going on. Just boredom. Fun huh?   Well, right now I'm just sitting here looking at sites because there's nothing on tv right now and listening to one of my favorite bands, Yellowcard.  Song:  Empty Apartment-Yellowcard  *(already in a previous post)*
