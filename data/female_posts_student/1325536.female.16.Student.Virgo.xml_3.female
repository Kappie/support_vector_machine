He'd been waiting for this type of situation for months now and just when he was beginning to despair, thinking that he'd never be able to finally be alone with Damien, he lucked out with the boy's parents feeling the need vacation. Proving himself as an upstanding, wholesome college student that truly cared for the Snow family (Damien especially) and their business had been quite a task for Joel. It also required patience on his part since the image he was portraying wasn't true to himself. Despite the charade he was currently taking part in, Joel found out what he was acting was enjoyable. It wasn't necessarily fun to be the nice and caring guy, but there was something appealing about it.  "Welcome back. How did the swimming go?" Joel asked, looking down and quickly shut off the radio after some horrible teeny bopper song had started. When he faced Damien again, Joel let his eyes licentiously roam over the boy's body. The twelve year old's medium brown hair was closer to a coffee color since it was still rather damp and in the process of drying off. It was messy and cutely sticking up in places. Obviously Damien hadn't bothered to do anything with it. A used towel was carelessly wrapped around his neck and currently was the only thing on his upper body. The boy was tanned, but not excessively so. Joel had never cared for the extremes concerning skin complexion. Wet, but not dripping swimming trunks clung to the boy's hips and legs. Damien's feet were in casual flip flops, which enhanced the boyish and easy going look.  Joel was all too aware that if he let his mind wonder, he'd end up getting aroused which may have caused problems. The blonde needed to be careful with how things were going to advance. He expected that some difficulty would result, but not a lot. The last two years the college student had been extremely observant of Damien and was fairly confident that he understood the boy. To assure success, Joel knew it depended on his controlled and thought out actions.
