Put the hot dog in the liquid nitrogen and then, to the amazementof your friends, smash your "finger" with a hammer. (Wes Denisson)Comment: Keep in mind which finger...  Get a pot of boiling water and pour some nitrogen in it. You will watch the mists of hell shrouding the floor. It's good fun to test how longyou can stand sticking a finger into it - a cool feeling ...  Freeze a can of shaving cream and then peel the can away from thecream. Put the canless cream into someone's car. Let the oven-likeheat from the car's sitting in the sun defrost the shaving cream. 2 cans will fill an entire car. (Coulter C. Henry, Jr.) [sarcastic laugh]
