Any way, I do give off a bit too much heat any way I guess! It's reached that one hair wash a day time *sigh* ahh, I hate those! Erm, yeah, I'm not crazy I swear! Hmm, I don't feel too well. :( :( :( But I've been on a spending spree at  urlLink amazon  so that helped. Seriously though, mesa (table?!?!) not feel tooo good. Hey I better go play a game to make me feel better! Eugh, french homework, not good! Today has been fun I guess, totally boring. I recon they're actually trying to kill us in Geography, less people in lessons! Hehe, but we got to see a very scary picture of our tutor with a wig on! Actual hair?! *shock horror!* :O Neighbours is on! Gotta go, love ya all!
