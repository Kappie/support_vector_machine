Or did they just let yall know that Cary screwed with the votes?  I can't believe that he did that.  According to Tao Tao, Cary was standing over the 1th grade thingy telling people who to vote for.  I seriously doubt that people will change their votes, but who can ever tell?  I still say that Catherine wins.
