I think I did really good on a chemistry test. 6th period study hall wasn't the greatest today right Danielle? "My life is on the floor." How sad. 8th period was awesome. I had a lesson but instead I just hung out in the chorus room with Heidi, Aaron, and Linz. Aaron and I listened to The Early November and talked about music. That was cool. I found out that I can bring my TEN cd in to Best Buy and get a new one because mine skips. I think I might do that sometime. I was singing on the bus the whole way home but I was bored. So now I'm listening to The Early November and typing on here and downloading Rooney. Later I have jazz band from 6-10ish. Tomorrow I think I'm staying after school to help set up for Cabaret.  Song:  Way to try, I got a line For you from me, better nice A beautiful, baby blue Sky that's looking up at you Now watch it fade away  But it's okay We'll come around With nights like this are never ending I try so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you were better  I know you want it all And you got me Sorry I never was everything you ever dreamed But kept at bay, for just in case that day  -Baby Blue- The Early November
