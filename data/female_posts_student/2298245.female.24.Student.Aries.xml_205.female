Now, if only I can keep up with going to bed early and getting up (relatively) early, since I have so many days off before I have to get up early again.  But I will do my best.  No caffeine after 3 PM, which means I need to hurry up and get going, or I'm going to miss out on my caffeine quotient completely today.
