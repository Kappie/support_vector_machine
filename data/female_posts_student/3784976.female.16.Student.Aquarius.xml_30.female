The noise ended after awhile, and then about 20 minutes later I heard it again.  I knew who it was, everybody in the house knew who it was, but we wanted to see what this person would do.  You were at our house for about 15 minutes.  We knew you were out there, but we didn't know where you were.  You kept calling, and you wouldn't GO AWAY!  We could hear you, and we saw your car.  My mom couldn't sleep, she was really mad, and ya....that is pretty much all.  So now you know how my night went....thanks to SOMEONE!  I am gonna be all right, I am gonna be all right!  Hopefully.  I won't be mad at you forever, but right now I am.  I will be okay in the morning.....goodnight all!  k-
