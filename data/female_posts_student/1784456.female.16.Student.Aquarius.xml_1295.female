Geez, I must really be getting fat! I'm actually very proud of myself, being a true slob I woke up at 12:00 today! I almost got up at 7, but my body wouldn't let me so I went back to sleep! Wow, maybe me and Laura can appear on 'Fat Club' now! *Or some thing like that, hey I don't watch that type of tv! I don't wanna be anorexic! And I would be if I started to watch it!*
