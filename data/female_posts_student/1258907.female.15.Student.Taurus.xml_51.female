Will you keep the tears from falling right down from my eyes? Can you promise? Will you promise? Just please be there.. Will you take care of me? Take my darkest thoughts, and make them bright for me? Will you be there to make me strong, and to lean on... When my heart is just, so cold.. Will you be the one, thats there for me most? Will you be there if I call you in the middle of the night? Will you keep the tears from falling right down from my eyes? Can you promise? Will you promise? Just please be there.. Do you even love me at all today? Will just anything take that love away? When I need someone Will you be that one, I need? Can you promise? Will you promise? That you'll always be there for me...
