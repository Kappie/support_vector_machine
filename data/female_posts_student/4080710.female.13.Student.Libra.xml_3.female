The bible tells us specifically why God made us and what he thinks of us...     Deuteronomy 32:10-you are the apple of his eye     Exodus 19:5-you are his own special treasure, (which we are)     Isaiah 43:4-you are precious in his sight and he loves you     Isaiah43:7-you were created for his glory     Jeremiah31:3-he loves you with an everlasting love      To be a Christian you have to admit that your not perfect and you have faults in your life. Jesus' death on the cross provided salvation for all poeple in the world, but for it to be any use in your life you must believe that Jesus died for you and accept this free gift of salvation.     An example of salvation is, in bible times when a lie was said or done, a sacrifice of animal had to be made and when Jesus died he took away the sacrfices with his one great sacrifice,(his life), so now we just have to ask for forgivness and say we are sorry.    If you want to say sorry to God for all the wrong things you've done, but you don't know how, just repeat this prayer...    Dear Jesus,      Be my master, and rule my life with your love. Teach me to fo positive things, that are pleasing to you. That way, i'll get it right with your help. And then i'll be doing the do's and wont be concerned about the don'ts. Please Jesus forgive me of my sins      In Jesus name...    Amen
