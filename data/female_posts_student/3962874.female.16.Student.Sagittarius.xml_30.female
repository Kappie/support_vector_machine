The store was having a huge sale so we got like 50% off the total purchase, and ended up saving 250 dollars. I have a hard time finding clothes that fit me because I'm tall so I have to buy long sized jeans at certain stores, and a lot of tops dont fit me, they all end up being short and wide. I noticed that as sizes go up in t-shirts, the width just gets bigger and the length stays about the same. So I try to find a longer shirt and I can't, because they only get wider! Anyway, I did find a really cute open-neck cable-knit sweater and it ended up being 16 dollars total. I think I should have bought two because sweaters are also a hard-to-find thing for me. I am just a hard person to shop for. And I'm picky, put those together and I'm never happy! Daniel and I are heading back to dad's in about half an hour.
