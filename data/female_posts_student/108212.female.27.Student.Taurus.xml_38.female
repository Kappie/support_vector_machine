I can imagine what it must've been like, though.. Noone special has been through Wichita recently. Vanilla Ice (yck ! ) performed at Rita's just a couple of days ago. I'm not that desperate to go to a concert. So I passed. The last concert Brian and I went to was a while back.. Godsmack, Stained, Cold and Systematic.    How does everyone like the new layout? I forget who designed it, but it was one of the winning entries in Blogger's Template Design Contest. By the way, you all need to give me blurbs about you that we can put on the members column to the right.. It's kind of bare right now.
