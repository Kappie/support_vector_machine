Would there be anyone who will love me like how Eric loves me? He is the only one... Only one who really loves me for who I am... Not for my looks and not for anything else...    The "try my best" really took my faith away... Uncertainty is all I can feel now... If you can't take me for who I am, then why waste time? Many people out there for you to pick and customise to the way you want your partner to be... Am I right?    It's a pity... Real pity. Perhaps it's only true that he can only remain as part of me, my memories... So sweet... So painful... So real and always so true.   Kisskiss!
