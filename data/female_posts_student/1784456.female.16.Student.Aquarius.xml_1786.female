Obviously it'll just be so that they can buy candy floss... but that's cool - we can steal it from them! Oh who cares if it rains, I have two heavy duty army poncho's that will fit at least three people under each one! And it would be cool. We could try to fly a kite! Of course everyone will have forgotten physics by then and probably try to fly the handle while holding the kite. Yup, sounds like good fun!
