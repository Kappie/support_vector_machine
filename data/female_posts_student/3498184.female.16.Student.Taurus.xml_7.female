I got other otter pops...I better not get addicted like someone else I know...*cough* haha. You know who you are. :D  I've been runnin errands all day, or else I was doing HW. It's Almost 9:00pm and I'm still not finished. Grrr... why do teachers suck so incredibly bad? They are like "Hey, it's the weekend here's 600 things to do. GO GO GO! I still have to study for my stupid crawdad quiz, hopefully it's not too hard. Crawdad's aren't that complicated.  Well I better get on that. LATERz ~Bailey
