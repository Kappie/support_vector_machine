I take my driving test tomorrow to get my license so everybody say good luck meg. I need it. I practiced my parallel parking again today and it was actually good! I just hope it will be tomorrow.....AHHH! I'm really nervous. The kids i had to babysit today are the devil. Everything they say, they yell. And they run around and scream and no matter what i said they didn't calm down. The one girl wanted to microwave her peanut butter  jelly sandwich. OOKaAaAaAaY!!! Tomorrow morning at 9:00 = death.
