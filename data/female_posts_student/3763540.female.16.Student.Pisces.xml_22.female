So when do things become so complicated when do our minds change over i guess puberty(eeww i really hate that word it just sounds so gross) neway... i just liked sitting there watching them they got such joy out of the little things in life like coloring and getting candy and while i baby sat kenzie i watched her giggle in delight over squeezing a sponge full of water out and then filling it up again and running around the yard. I guess in a way it comes down to the fact that we become very unappreciative and ungrateful little wretches. Suddenly everything must evolve around us and if something goes wrong we ask why has god cursed us?Everything becomes the parents fault and Gods why because we are too big headed to realize that stuff is our fault and that if maybe you went back to church or just opened the bible that thing you used to laugh while you patted it in bible class maybe then we would realize that everything happens for a reason and that things have consequences and that its not all about just doing what we want but what god wants! Its really a good thing god doesnt get teen angsty cause we would probably all be dead because of the amount of people that just push aside his word his knowledge his path the guidance and light of our life... its so simple yet so hard to grasp....   I dont understand why people always have to go somewhere to have fun. Its so nice just to be able to sit in a hammock in your own back yard under gods trees and just think and swing. and to just smell a flower and to run and climb a tree for some reason those things become to very "immature" but why there really isnt nothing wrong with it. We tend to forget the simple pleasures of life ... its weird that just watching three year olds for 4 nights could show you all this....
