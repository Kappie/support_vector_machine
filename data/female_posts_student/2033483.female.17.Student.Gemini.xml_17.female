(Going over the day in my head) ...Mine and Renae's commentary was published but I was too afriad to read it in print b/c of the fear of embarassment.  If you really want to know my opinion on Arnold Schwarzenegger you can im me b/c I fear my strong political opinion may be too long to keep your interest in my blog.  I did "eh..." on my AP History test.  If I'm still here tomorrow after my Physics and Algebra 2 tests and an AP Lit and Comp quiz I'll consider myself  very  lucky.  I'm sure I'm not the first to say this, but I hate physics 100%!  Now, not the class like the people in it but the material.  I must say Mike Anderson is growing on me. Their are too many formulas to work with.   After school I simi-walked out to my car with Ross, he said he was excited to go "jam".  okay.  But on my way home I drove slow b/c all that awaited me here was homework and we all know how fun that is.  When I drove by his house he was standing outside with Stanley.  If you say you don't like the kid why do you hand out with him, huh??  That's like me hanging out with McPotty, not gonna happen...EVER!   Well, that was a chipper note to end this on. ~bye
