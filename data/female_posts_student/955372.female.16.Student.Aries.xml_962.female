I've been telling my mom for like a few months now that I need 4 or 5 white feather boas for my Bjork in the Swan dress costume and I wanted to go to like wallmart or a dollar store to get one because if you go to a halloween shop they're 10-20 bucks. So today she goes to a Halloween store and buys me one. I appreciate the gesture but when I see that bag that says "Halloween Town" and when I say "you only bought one?" and she gets all confused, it makes me think that maybe I just shouldn't bother talking anymore.
