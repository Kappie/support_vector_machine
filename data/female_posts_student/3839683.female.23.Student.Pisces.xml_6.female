Rob bought it for me from his commander one day at work and brought it home to me. It's a magnetic yellow ribbon that has the first cav patch on one side of the ribbon. People can be such asses sometimes you know? He was mad when I told him about it and I feel really bad about it too. It's not like anyone in this town would have known what it meant anyways since there is no army bases anywhere near me. There is a national guard though but nothing with first cav, so I don't know. I just know that if and when I find it on someone's car I am taking it back and giving them a piece of my mind. The lack of respect that a person has for another is unbelievable. Especially when the person has a family member that protects you everyday, it is so sad in this country. How could someone be so low? People have no clue what so ever as to what soldiers and their families go through... So one could only imagine how much that ribbon meant to me...
