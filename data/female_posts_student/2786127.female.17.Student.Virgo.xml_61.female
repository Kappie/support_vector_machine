I'm crazy! and its SUCH and improvement from my stupid 89 pontiac grand prix. But you know whats strange though? in some small way i miss that piece of shit...   I think I'll get over it though. I won't forget the memories Leonard(my old cars name)*sniff*  My shiny pretty red tracker now needs fitting name. I think...red is like...the color of sluts, my car is a slut, and therefore needs a slutty name. any suggestions?  Happy Birthday Genie! This was an awesome day.
