We're nowhere near done w/ it so we're going 2 try 2 have meetings where we can write  type it up on my computer. as for now I can't wait for loren 2 come over. Im probably going 2 have 2 go grocery shopping first. We have basically nothing in the house. No soda or anything. i'm surviving on water, sandwiches,  pasta. ugh
