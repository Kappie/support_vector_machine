I was TRYING so hard to get help and she kept ignoring me or saying she would help me but always ran out of time and well I went to the math resource room and asked that lady how to do some of the stuff but she didn't make very much sense.  If I don't do very well on the test though maybe it might be a good thing cause then the teacher will realize that I really really really....do NOT understand how to do many of the things and she always says "when I talk to you though it sounds like you know it all."  But well honestly only I am the one who knows myself the best and I think if anyone were to know if I didn't understand something it would be ME!  Today had its pros and today had its cons but really I think there was much more great things that happened.  I got a 14 out of 15 on my chem quiz!!!!!!!!!!!  That is like a 93% and well I did good on something in chem.  I actully did good on almost everything in this new unit after the review one from last year that didn't go over so well.  I have gotten 100's on all my labs for the unit and well and 74% on the first quiz and a 93% on this one - all I need to do now if get a really good mark on the unit test.  And well Mrs. J came up to me and asked how Chem is going which even though I actually don't feel really bad about chem right now its nice to know people do care about others and that she does care about how I am doing in chem or even about how I feel.  She's different from alot of the other teachers, there is just something about her.  I mean my TA would never ask me how things are going like she does and well I think she really has a good understanding of what people feel and go through.  I'm writing a poem right now which is not finished but I want to give it to her at the end of gr. 12, on the last day that I will probably see her for the last time and I just for once at the end of grade 12 to let her know how amazing she really is and how she had touched the lives of people around her and made them feel special and helped them to understand.  So here is what I have so far.     Thank you  People come and people go But you were so special I want you to know I’ve never met anyone so kind and so caring You were different, all that knowledge you were sharing  I still remember one day walking by You gave me a smile instead of a “hi” That feeling inside was something so great A gift that anyone could appreciate  There is just that something special about you You know what to say and you know what to do You helped me with science and with chem too Helped me to deal and helped me to get through  Forever a memory of you will rest in my heart I didn’t think you would be so cool right from the start But wonderful things they come and they go The thing in life is that we never really know  So here is a thank-you to all that you have done You have made such an impact on everyone You are an inspiration, and a role model too There is nothing about you that I would undo   Thank you  ~Vanessa
