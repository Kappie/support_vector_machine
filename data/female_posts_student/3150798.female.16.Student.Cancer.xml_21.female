And after a week in Colorado away from it all, that should be a bit easier.  So, about camp... Where do I start?  First of all, I had a refreshing new view of God's creation. We passed through Kansas, and while some people might have thought it boring, I found it to be gorgeous. I was amazed by the endless view of the sky. On the way back, driving at night, I watched a storm over the praries that must hvae been miles off, but I could see the lightning illuminating the dark sky. The greatness of the sky sort of reminded me of the greatness of God.   When we got into Colorado, the totally flat praries turned into rolling hills. There were still no trees, so you could see all of those beautiful, rolling, green hills. And then, after we got out of Denver, I saw the Rocky Mountains for the first time.  The snow really surprised me. I didn't realize the mountains would have those white caps in late June. And then the hugeness of the mountains overtook me. I courd hardly see the tops of some of the mountains. And then, we began driving up, for miles and miles, towards camp.  I think I'll tell some more about it later. I'm out of time for now.
