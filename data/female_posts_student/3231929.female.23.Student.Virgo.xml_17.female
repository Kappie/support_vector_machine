Had a practical skills session this afternoon too, it was good apart from a useless SHO trying to teach us about developmental milestones. I object to being murmured at.  The weather was quite sticky today. Luckily this afternoon there were some brief rumbles of thunder and a few drops of rain to dissipate the mugginess.  I had Ann on the phone this evening, she was concerned about Mum. In the room Mum stayed there was a ¾ length mirror which she had apparently turned to face the wall. Ann was concerned as this probably indicates that Mum has pretty low self esteem. It doesn’t surprise me, she has put on a lot of weight over the past year or so, but I don’t see how she thinks running from the problem is going to help. I suggested we gently suggested she add to her interests something at the leisure centre like swimming as I’m sure they must have at least one session a week of women only.  I got another edition of Runner’s World today, reminding me that I haven’t done any real exercise myself for a few months.
