Too many, I'm afraid, I've already forgotten. Many meaningful conversations lost forever, millions of opinions, views and shades of life, gone....  I've strongly opposed the 'mad and crazy' idea that some day there could be an immersion between human and computer.... it seems too inhuman. But for memory, it just might be worth all the minuses. (Or then not, haha, stubborn to the end).  I miss the things I've lost (and will lose), things I'm unable to reminiscene, or 'relive'. I'm worried to live further, fearing more events will slip away without making me grow as a person, without having any impact on me. I fear forgetting events of my young age, losing the pillar and foundation of myself. I know for the most part I suppose it's close to impossible to have that happen, unless one gets a permanent, total memory loss, but I still worry about the possibility of forgetting some essential part of myself, one or more of the most basic qualities that help me define who I am.  It's not like I need advice, such as 'let go and live the life' cos I do not sit in a corner, passively, waiting for the life to pass me and worrying of my memory. But sometimes, when there's 'A MOMENT' in life, a faint thought of its possibilities of surviving in my braincells passes my thoughts.
