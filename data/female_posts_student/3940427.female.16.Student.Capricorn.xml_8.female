I feel bad for her. o_O; I'm not used to having a cat sleep at the end of my bed so I'd wake up and I'd practically be strangling her with my feet.    Jack's at the vet right now. Poor kitty. He cried the whole way there. I think we can take him home around 3 pm tonight though, so all will be good. ^-^    *tries to look around Winnie's rear end as she blocks the computer screen* Gaaah... Stoopid cat, you're in the way! ._.' Now she's playing with a pencil...    Aaah, anyway! I should probably shut up now... Yeah. I think I'll do that.
