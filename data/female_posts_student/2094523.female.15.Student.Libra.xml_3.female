The ones i thought of who were my best friends all walked away and turned their backs...and i dont think they were my friends.. i dont think they ever will be and i dont think they give a shit either.. but i do Friends only happen in story books..the ones u tell ure deepest secrets to, the one u confide in, the one u run to for everythun, the ones with the shoulders to cry on, the one to kick bitches for u, the ones to make u laugh..(by tellin a native joke (see below)), or the ones that tell the truth  no matter how it hurts.. or maybe it only comes once in a while  and i just havent gotten to that point yet.. nah. i dont think they exist... maybe we're all dreaming..we wake up and this is just a bad bad dream...
