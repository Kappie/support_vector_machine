(or is it mrs. now? i 4get...) willson, pretty boring.  lunch° trying to memorize my speech one last time  6° ah, presentations. luckily, my group was last... unluckily the bell rang and we still had to go... she said we could leave, but everybody had left and it was the best time to make the speech, esp. b/c i start stumbling on words when i'm nuvrous and the fact that it was in spanish made it worse. so i decided to stay after school. that means i miss the bus, which means i had to walk to the mall... (and i didnt get the grade i'd hoped, but it wasnt' totaly horrible) and on the way there, i saw the bus pass me. so i was kinda pissed off, so i started walking home (a 45 minute walk, if you're in REALLY LATE and worried UR COACH who you're trying to make a good impression on so you can make the VOLLEYBALL team, and ur mom runs out on u and ur dads at work and the stupid bus didn't come. so i started my lonely walk home, constantly calling my dad. who reluctantly agreed to pick me up. he picked me up 1/2 way there n says im walking on the rong side of the road.  i'm relli drained rite now, lack of sleep, stressed, but it's almost over... slowly but surely, almost over... one big hurtle passed, couple more to go and im home free.  oh ya, n my arm hurts from the battle of dawn. this morning i could hardly move it, and if i did, it moved at 1 mph. i guess slinging the water balloons in such a way made me use muscles i normally dont use, so now i'm HELLA sore, and very grouchie...  11 more days... 1 more days...  •patty•
