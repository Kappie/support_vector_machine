I'm just so used to writing on IMs or emails that i dont bother anymore.. lol.  So yeah, this is my frist journal entry online EVER.  I have never been too good at keeping up my journals in the past but i thought i would give it a try after christy sent me the link to hers:)  I'm really not sure if anyones even gonna want to read this but at least im putting it out there for you!  lol.  Today i actually had to set my alarm clock for the first time in .. well a long time, and like always, i wake up just before its about to go off.  I had to make my way out to my dads house to meet my step-mom (still sounds weird saying that!) to pick up a check from my dad to pay the loan payment since it was already 10 days late..lol.  good one dad!  Anyway, i couldnt get to their house because of construction going on and so i tried making my way around and ended up lost and out running out of gas.  So, i made my way home to call the witch and she proceeded to yell and scream at me for not meeting her..  of course she didnt wait to hear WHY i wasnt there!  Anyway, i got r done!  Im always excited for mondays, unlike most people i guess..lol.  Mondays my sister erin comes over and we have dinner and watch "our shows"  which consist of "for love or money" and "road rules".  Its great and tourturing at the same time.  They always leave me wanting more, thats for sure!  Those damn reality shows get me every time..lol.  Oh yeah, fire up for July 6th!  The new amazing race starts.. that was always my favorite:)  Well, tomorrow at 2:30pm i will finally be finding out the results of my MRI.  I cant believe the day is finally here!  Getting the MRI sucked ass though.. i was in SO much pain dispite the two vicodin i took before hand.  Lets hope i dont have to do THAT again.  I'll be posting the restults tomorrow for sure!    boyfriend status: got one sex status: need some
