And the hair dresser was talking to my mum about how much i looked like her (yeah right, it took her about 10 mins to realise that we were related let alone that she was my mum) and then the hairdresser said "blah blah blah ....and she has such beautiful eyes" scary as hell. she could have talked about my hair but no, goes straight for the eyes.  Rhedyn "Nevermore"
