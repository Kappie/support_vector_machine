Someone else to live in the void of this!!! *trust me on this, the internet is a never ending void* I just hope I don't have a dream about getting stuck in it... I'm having weird vivid dreams. Last night it was a weird one about saving the Thunderbirds pilots from these 'villans' which was interesting... considering that I was trying to push this teeny 'car' along, when the people could have caught up with us in seconds... *don't worry, i bet i saved them... in the end.* Anyway.... how is everyone? Coping with the heat wave? *it just gives me an excuse for being lazy* I go through fazes of hyperness and lazyness, I guess it's when I think I have to try and when I don't! Mmm... I should start writing again, it's nice when no one tells you how bad at something you are. Muhaha, but I guess I'm not, confusion is a good point.
