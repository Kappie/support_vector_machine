Since he first came into my life, I was doing one of my favorite things--walking through the bookstore--I have done everything in my power to forget him.  I staunchly deny, rather too staunchly I'll grant you, that his book can hold my interest from cover to cover.  I proclaim, to myself and the one friend aware enough to be reading  urlLink his primary reason  for being considered one of the most intelligent of the many quite idiotic popular culture figures without my having referred her, that anything can make it to the the #1 spot of the Bookseller's Choice List in Chapter 11--they just want to sell all the copies they ordered hoping to catch some of the run-off of customers who tried to get it at Borders (but they were sold out) for everyone on the under $15 portion of their Christmas/Hanukkah list.  Resist, resist, resist I did.  Just because everyone was talking about it didn't mean I was going to jump up and dive in as well.  And by everyone, I don't even mean the worst kind of everyone--I mean all the smart,  hip , bookish twenty-somethings like myself.  Though I'll wager they know a bit more about the plethora of coffees offered at Starbucks and the designs of Birkenstocks offered in The States than I.  No matter that the everyone of whom I am speaking are normally a group I don't mind being lumped in with--could be worse, after all.  Feelings of selling out and being common descend on me whenever I'm confronted with decisions about going with the rest of the pack.  I absolutely can't do it.  Must be my own woman.  Must chart my own course.  Must do exactly as I choose only because it is, naturally, what I would do without outside influence.  Of course this isn't always possible, but I give it my damnedest, believe you me.  So, though I, secretly, instantly fell in love with the title (positively creamed my panties at the thought that God made men near my age that clever) I outwardly put up the best defense a book junkie could to buying anything Mr. Smarty-Pants-Next-Brilliant-Young-Thing-Eggers wrote.  (For the next 5 years at least--long enough for the fervor to have died down and my interest could safely have had no origination in the current hoopla).  What follows is the abbreviated tale of our one-sided, petulantly anguished relationship.  I'm thinking of calling it...well, I'm sure it's quite obvious, if you know who Dave Eggers is, that the title of this entry is an allusion (quite a clever little homage, though I say so myself) to  urlLink his most lauded print work.   I saw this book in every bookstore between here and Savannah, on the most prominent of displays, and arrogantly walked by it each time after my initial perusal.  But it haunted me.  For a full 3 years it has haunted me.  Then he started appearing in almost all of the periodicals I read (obviously other than his own)--even in Spin magazine.  Discussing one female artist I'm already truly enamored of and one I'll soon be, thanks to his tantalizing description of her.  Which is where you find me.  At the end of our rendez-vous.  I told you it was a short tale...though not quite yet the end, because I have not yet read the book.  I just know that I can no longer run from it.  I must pick it up.  I read, again today, yet another wrenchingly beautiful excerpt from it.  How can I not have more of him?  And why do I feel betrayed because I also found out in the article that excerpted this new portion which has forced me to let Dave in, that he is married?  You mean...he hasn't been thinking about me the entire time I've been staging the "Not Giving Eggers a Second Thought" play?  Oh.  With only a few other books have I had the title or the author give pursuit of me like Eggers has.   Wuthering Heights ,  Pride and Prejudice , Joyce's  Portrait...  all followed me around.  And two out of three deemed brilliant, respectively, by me ain't a bad record.  So, yeah.  Me and Dave are meeting up.  Finally.  But just so that I can maintain a smidge of my dignity...certainly not before I finish my meeting with  urlLink Maria McCann.   So there.  I  will  lay down for Mr. Eggers, (even pretend I don't want it as much as I do) but only when I'm good and ready.
