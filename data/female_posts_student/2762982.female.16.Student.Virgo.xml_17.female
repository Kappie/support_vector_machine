I'd explain it, but its beyond my reach of explain. Between working for her and trying to spend time with my sister, I've done little else...well...add CS into that too I guess. Time for everything almost.  Myles is still in Ashland with his dad and his brother...can't wait till he comes back :P only 2 more weeks...almost less then that I think now. Maybe another trip to seattle...which would be fun to see seattle this time :)  I don't know why I decided to post...it's 2:40 in the morning...maybe that's why. Can't sleep, too much on my mind. The good and bad of life. I've dealt with so much of it, I noticed I blocked a lot out of my life lately, like friends. No one has any idea on how much I miss having and spending time with those people you get along with really well. I think I play a lot of CS because of that. Yeah, I get along well with most people that I play with, and I love playing with my EN famliy, but I'm starting to miss the social interaction. I had a lot of fun with them all when we had the lan in Seattle, but that's gone, so I'm not seeing them 3 days in a row now.  I love rambling in the mornings when I don't really make any sense to myself. It's so helpful to get everything else out, even if I don't know what I'm saying exactly. Like the topic of Mr. Ben John Groeneveld. Yeah, that's my dad, mr asshole. we used to get along when he was spoiling me, but then things got out of hand. I don't know what caused the break, but I know what led up to it. Dropping out of school...very slowly...it was one class at a time type of thing, then there was the car accident, then the house sitting...lets see, the last one must've been when I spent the week at mom's cause he was away on buisness. Wow, that's a lot. Too bad I don't feel like going over it all.  Sometimes I wonder if I sound very very sad (srry, big words aren't working right now). All in self-pity and not really taking things in...repeating everything, making stuff look harder and seem worse than it really is. probably another one of my bad habits. Oh well, right now I can't think of a way to deal with it, other then to maybe keep writing here? I guess cause then I won't be ranting to people and this way I can look back over the shit I say.  What I need to work on is what I want to get done. High School, College, Pitter-Patter Business's, and whatever else comes my way. New car, new computer, my own house...big dreams but I've got the time to get it all done.  For the oddest of reasons I'm really missing Kathleen, Jason, Dave, Jaton and those guys (too many to list at this time of day for me). Yeah, they are a lot older than me, but I fit in ;) there were never and really odd moments. It was comfortable, and I miss that. ok   time for bed I guess...lets see if sleep comes tonight.
