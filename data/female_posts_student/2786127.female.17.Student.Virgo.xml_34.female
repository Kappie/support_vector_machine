As I was laying the hallway today at break sandwhiched between Genie and Ashley, i realized something. Somewhere along the lines all of us girls just...stopped being friends. Fell apart. Slowly and agonizingly. Today I see it in its final state...an era has died,  A good era, an era of happiness and girls and fun...  A new era has begun, one of lies and depression and boys.  I'm just going to have to come right out and say that boys are definatly to blame for this catastrophe. I miss my friends god dammit... I miss my only source of happiness.   And this is why I sit here and eat a thousand peeps.  ... and become obese.  As sad as this is and as guilty as I feel for thinking it but i cannot WAIT until next year when everyones boyfriends are off in college(only staci and lindsays....but still, i definatly would love lindsay back.) and then things might possibly swing back into... or at least close to, normality.   Sleep.
