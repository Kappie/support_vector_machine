Then we tried getting tickets for Saturday's late show, and there were only 5 tickets left (and we needed 6).  Well, when Druck got back from his Target thing, he, Michael, and I played some Xbox.  Then we went over to the Billiards room and played pool for a bit.  Anyhow, on Friday night we went to Kerbey Lane for dinner, and headed to the Metropolitan to see  urlLink May .  The movie was one of the strangest, coolest movies I've seen in awhile.  I think it was cool... it was (as Melissa described) disturbing, but it was really cool.  Brings back memories of hanging with the courtyard crows... all those loveable weirdos.  :-)  Anyhow, so that was Friday night.    Saturday- We slept in, then finally got up and all showered and decided to go grab some food.  We came back to the apartment, bummed around, played Xbox, and then finally decided to go shoot some pool.  Well, Wolf's card wouldn't work, so we went and sat by the hot tub while we waited for Druck to come with his working card.  Ricky turned on the hot tub, and this HUGE mound of foam developed.  We guessed that someone put a scoop of laundry detergent in the tub, so one it started circulating water, it made bubbles.  Okay, so then Melissa called and asked what we were doing, and she and Richard decided to come over... and Alexis, too.  First I took a picture of Ricky sticking his head in the bubble hill that was in the hot tub...!  It was funny looking.  Anyhow, we played a few games of pool... probably about an hour.  Then we all decied to go to I Love Video and rent this kung fu movie we saw a trailer for before May.  It was called  urlLink Shaolin Soccer ... and it was FUNNY!  :-)  We all grabbed some food before we headed over to the girls' apartment, and then watched the movie.  Then the boys and I went back over to the guys' apartment.  We stayed up for a bit, but then fell asleep.  The weekend was fun... and hopefully we'll do it again soon.  Since we didn't see Mr. Sinus, we wanted to see it before they're done with Speed.  So, Mike and I will have to go back to Austin in a couple weeks or something.  Maybe we'll just wait til Spring Break.  :-)  That'd be fun!  Anyhow, okay... so... that's all for now... I'll post more later in the week!!!  Hope everyone had an awesome weekend...and hope everyone has an awesome week!  :-)
