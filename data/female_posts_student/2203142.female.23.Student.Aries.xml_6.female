Imagine yourself suffusing a woman's gown or sheets          your bloodstream running through a king's inkwell.  Those rich dyes once were your ideas, your love          of broccoli rabe. Half-killed cockles attract purples,  the reef is littered with open mouths waiting to snap.          I am trying to make my pain attractive, my yearning  pretty. A man caught me in a fine-ply lobster pot.          He scalded me until I nearly died, then threw me back.  I gape like this because of the ordeal. Did you foresee          this moment, where what you intended to devour  devours you? Did you know they'd haul us up          into the suffocating air, our bodies fused together?  He wrecked my body so that it looked like need.          You made your insatiable greed appear like love.   What a beautiful poem! And that last verse! Oh wow! Just the way I feel... you made your insatiable greed appear like love... and I put a question of my own to you... Why?
