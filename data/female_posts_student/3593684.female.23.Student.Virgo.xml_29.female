Had a grand time.  I went in the water for the first time.  Pooh-pooh to all of those southern californians who say the water is cold.  It's not.  It's fucking warm and you are all spoiled.  Washington beaches are cold.   Saturday night.  Susy, Bekha and I took off for wild night of drinking. I left my car at susy's and brought stuff to spend the night.  That meant i could get drunk drunk drunk. Which is exactly what I did.  I met some guy in the bar ( urlLink st. nicks ) .  Spent an hour and a half making out with him and earned the nickname, KM, short for Kissing Monster.  I guess I didn't bother posting this, but something very similar happened thursday night at  urlLink the white lotus .  But the saturday night was much cooler.  and younger.  and smelled better.  Sunday afternoon: shopping at the grove.  spent way too much money but got some very cute stuff.  all black, of course.  Sunday evening: the dreaded fourth of july.  Went to a firm event.  Fancy house, fancy party, boring conversation.  I did end up hanging out with mr. JAQ. Okay, that's not his real name, it's his initials.  His real name is john, but that gets confusing because there are a ton of johns at work, so he goes by his middle name.  but he hates his middle name.  So I started calling him "jack" spelled, JAQ, which works, because for whatever reason jack is a nickname for those named john.  weird.  Anyway, I think Mr. Jaq is developing an interest in me.  It's hard to say, though.  My dear readers must find me extremely self-centered since all I talk about are boys.  I'm not though. Okay, I am self-centered, but in an insecure self-doubting sort of way.  It still amuses me that a boy might be interested in me.  Monday afternoon:  More beach. This time down in Venice. The water is a little dirtier than santa monica but the beach is way less crowded.  I bought a body board and looked like a complete idiot trying to figure out how to use it.  Also.  Bekha, rebecca and I walked up and down the little beach strip.  I bought a cowboy hat. tres exciting.  An observation:  most people who wear just a bikini top and shorts/skirt when walking shouldn't, because most people look fat when they do that.  Of course, I was guilty of doing the same damn thing. and I probably looked fat too. It's really hard to suck in your gut without any support from your clothing.    Monday night: Had a lovely dinner with the lovely miss rebecca. Called Mr. Saturday night (the guy from  urlLink st. nicks ).  No answer.  too bad.  went to bed.  Tuesday:  Went to work.  Worked.  Went home.  Sorted my laundry.  My GOD! it is really gross how many articles of clothing I have acquired.  Here are my piles of laundry, all full loads mind you:  1 pile of pink 1 pile of purple 1 pile of browns 1 pile of blues and greens 1 pile of whites 1 pile of black pants 1 pile of black tops 1 pile of black dresses/skirts 1 pile of jeans 1 pile of sporty stuff 1 pile of jackets/sweat shirts  11 loads of laundry.  jesus.  And that's only five weeks worth of clothing.  But I guess that isn't too out of proportion.  that's like two loads a week.  I just haven't done laundry in five weeks...  Okay.  So onto the part about the good news coming in threes.  Mr. David e-mailed me monday night Mr. Rod e-mailed me tuesday afternoon and Mr. Saturdaynight called me tonight.   Hell yeah.  Okay. so mr. david barely wrote anything at all.  He did say that he "missed hanging out with me."  I guess that's okay.  I would have rather he said, "i miss you" but I'll take what I can get. and besides he's a dude and I over analyze everything  Which is why i love mr. rod.  Because he also overthinks everything.  And he sent me an Amazing e-mail.  In fact all of his e-mails are amazing. I should get his permission to post them.  because he is fucking funny.  and sweet. and I miss him.  sigh.  I miss david too.  I guess I understand how david could say that he loved his girlfriend and still bang me.  and still tell me that he cares about me.  Because I do care about david, and want to screw him and maybe even I love him.  and at the same time, I know i love rod. and if I really thought there was a shot at us being together I would probably go for it too.  that's a little bit depressing, I guess.  It certainly doesn't give me much hope for the david situation.  BUT fuck that shit.  Because I have a HOT date on thursday night with mr. saturdaynight.  Who, incidentally, is a med student at UCLA. So he's smart.  And he smells good.  Actually, he may smell too good, becuase he wears the same stuff that andy wore:  urlLink fahrenheit  by dior. I am a sucker for that stuff.  I really is like a love potion.   I hope Mr. Saturdaynight is as good looking and good smelling and funny and smart as he appeared to be when I first met him. That may be an unreasonable expectation as I was drunk.  We shall see.
