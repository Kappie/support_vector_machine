We're starting these cool projects in science, but I think I'm going to work alone on this one. Mine's going to rock the house... :-D I'm so tired. Kinda bored too. We have these huge projects in english due next week. I really should work on them... Man, I'm so tired I can't type right. I've had to redo sentences like five times by now. I miss ben. We're talking right now. He's such a sweety... :-D Well I think I'm done here. Don't really have anything important to say anyway. ONE WEEK TILL MATRIX! Yeah, that's it. Kristin
