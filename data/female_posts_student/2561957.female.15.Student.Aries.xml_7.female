I heard "Will You" on the radio earlier and just about spazzed out and caved. I can't be with you; I can't be without you. It just... sucks? Oh. Maybe you'll remember these; they both made me so happy I almost cried, but now I just can't look at them. It hurts too much.    I'm feeling empty. Not dead, just like I sold my soul. I don't think I can stand it, but I still partially think that what I did was best. I mean, now you don't have to lie about being happy to me anymore. Even when you were glowing you still couldn't let go - even for just that one minute.    So maybe this e-mail was pointless. Actually, I'm willing to bet my left lung that it was, like so many other things I do seem to be. Whatever. I'm going to post it on my blog, anyway. That way, I can remind myself how utterly sad I am, and, maybe, my blog will show up one day in the "Recently Updated" list and you can read it.    I know you're not going to ask for anything of me. You never have unless I asked you to ask something of me so I wouldn't feel so useless. You're just going to wait until I think it's time to do God-knows-what before you decide to openly worry.    Oh, lookie. I'm gabbering. I think that that's my cue to end this e-mail.    -Frankie    P.S.: Last night, before I went to bed, did you tell me you loved me? (I'm not sure, but I think you did. I was just depressed and tired last night...)
