Okay correct me if I'm just being gay but this kinda makes me angry. I went to pick up Kyla at about 9 then we came back here and all the people who were doing the jumps decided they were going to go to Julieta and Luisa's house who Kyla is really good friends with and who used to be friends with me but now we are just kind of acquaintances, sometimes they will say Hi to me but not usually. Anyway's everyone was going to go over to their house for an hour or so before watching meteors so they did and Kyla all of a sudden remembered that she had left her guitar over at their house so she wanted to go over there and get it. So we did and on the way over Kyla kept talking about how the people that were at my house were all lame and boring and stuff. Then we got there and she was all talking with everyone and hanging out like having a good time and of course I am uncomfortable because I barely talk to the people and I don't really like hanging out with people there anyways. So Daniel and I are just sitting there waiting for Kyla to "get her guitar". Anyways, we are there for like half an hour until people start leaving to go watch the meteor shower. Then Daniel and I kinda went outside and Kyla said she was going to be there in a minute and 5 minutes later she came out with her guitar and was very unhappy I could tell by the look on her face (I have known her since 1st grade). Anyway I knew that she didn't want to hang out with me, she never does, so when she got in the car I told her she could stay there if she wanted to. She was like "Can I? You're not going to be mad are you?" YOU FUCKER. If you have to ask then you should just assume you are doing something rude that you shouldn't do. Anyway, stupid Megan told her that it was okay and that she didn't care. So she fucking got out of the car and left without a thought. I mean really, call me wanting to hang out, make me come get you, make me take you to get something from somewhere I have never even been with people I never even talk to, and then totally ditch me. It's been a long day and I'm going to bed. By the way it is past midnight!
