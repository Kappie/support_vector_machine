Minimalism.      Okay, yes, these are important, and often harped, concepts.  But do we really know how the end user thinks?  Or, perhaps more importantly, why the end user thinks in the manner that he or she does?  And, putting on your future thinking cap for just a moment, consider the multitudes of "types" of users gaining access to computers and the internet for the first time.  Tech companies may soon find need to woo additional cultures and markets in order to keep their books in the black.   The internet is the major engine enabling globalization, but what will globalization do to the internet?  429 million people are online globally.  That's only 6% of the world's population.  41% of those 429M are in the US and Canada.  As more Chinese and more Liberians come online, how will the fabric of the internet change?  As cultures gain "usage parity" how will internet norms concerning social and business transactions change discussion boards and ecommerce?  How will government policy toward commerce and free speech impact the internet?  And what will Google do?         How drastically do GUI usability concepts vary from culture to culture?  Is it possible to compare and contrast interface usability concepts of sophisticated users with those of non-computer-literate peoples in the developing world?   Does lack of access to the internet constitute a new type of informational poverty? How can folks who cannot read learn to use computers and the web?  How can technology be ethically and responsibly introduced to the populations of developing countries?  A fortune cookie I once enjoyed told me, "You are what you think about."  I guess I'm mainly part ether, part human and part keyboard, among sundry other things.  Obviously, I don't have answers to all the above questions/ponderings.  And I imagine trying to discern those answers should keep me occupied for quite a time.
