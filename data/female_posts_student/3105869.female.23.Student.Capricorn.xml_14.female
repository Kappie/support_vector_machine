Went to take the dog out only to realize I had given him intot he temporary custody of my parents, thanks to the lack of time.  I went to shower only to get out and feel like make-up wasn't  really  necessary.  I hate mondays, doesn't everybody.  Made it to school exactly 7 minutes before class, well there goes my "I'm gonna get there early and finish my brief before Constitutional law" theory.  He didn't pick it up.  Suddenly I felt let down, almost ssad he didn't pick it up and make me lose 4 points off my final grade for the lack thereof.  What's wrong with me?  I'm suddenly feeling sunken for not losing points?  Who am I?  I feel like I'm from the movei office space.  I hate law school, and my un-boyfriend won't label himself.  Maybe its not he brief that has me sunken.
