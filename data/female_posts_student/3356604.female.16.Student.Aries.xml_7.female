Isn't that nice...I'm talking to a fictitious character from a musical that is taking up all my free time and leaving me too tired to do anything in the time that is not free. Ah well, the prices we pay...Last night was opening night, and I have to say that aside several mishaps that caused me and several others to laugh uncontrolledly onstage the play went rather well. The first mishap was when the leading man said "I'm not going to ask you to marry you" which was followed by 'Dolly' saying things like "Well I wouldn't marry me either" and "I'm turning me down.' All funny stuff. Then one of the cast farted, which was audible onstage even though he'd retreated far into the backstage. Finally, the lead man got so carried away with shouting he had an enormous glob of saliva on his chin. And they expect us to be serious...Anyway, at the moment I'm sitting at my computer with my head wrapped in butter yellow silk. Yesterday I had my hair done, and the only thing to save it from being destroyed whilst I toss and turn in my sleep is a can of hairspray and silk to wrap it in. I'm sure I look quite strange at the moment with my makeshift turban, brown and blue scarf, dressing gown covered in flying pigs, pyjamas and ug-boots at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Oh well, what can you do?
