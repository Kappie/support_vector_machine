That's not to say that I dislike sports, because honestly I really love watching hockey and football and UConn Basketball, but when it comes to choosing teams I like or who I think will win: let the estrogen flow!    I have a few teams that I'm dearly devoted to for hockey its the Rangers, Avalanche and Dallas Stars.  (Though my recent trip to Toronto may cause me to scrap the Avs and Stars and stick with the Rangers  Leafs).  For football I love the Jets and the Titans.  So when one of "my teams" is playing, I'll naturally root for them.  Any other time though I pick with my chach.  That is to say I've played football pools and made sporting bets where I've chosen teams solely on whose uniform colors and or logo I like better, who has the cuter players or who has the more "heart warming" story (dude, I can't help it..Its the hormones).    Anyhow, for the Stanley cup finals I know a lot of the hockey purists wanted Calgary to win as they felt the cup needed to be returned to Canada and it had been over 10 years since a Canadian team had one, and yes, Jarome Iginla is kinda cute in a weird way, but his looks and their "need" for the cup was no match to that of the Tampa Bay Lightning.  First of all I have to say 3 things:  urlLink Martin St. Louis ,  urlLink Vinny Lecavalier    urlLink Brad Richards (who is also the Conn Smythe winner,BTW).  My  real  reason for rootin' for the Lightning though, was the fact that  urlLink Dave Andreychuk  has been in the goddamned N.H.L. as long as I've been alive and had never won the cup (correct me if I'm wrong, but I also think he never even made it to the finals...in 22 years?!?).  I'm a sucker for stuff like that so I wanted to see the lil fella win.    Win they certainly did.  I thought it was a pretty scrappy series, lots of good hits, goals and saves and everyone seemed to be "on" the entire time.  Some of the best hockey I've seen in a while (and trust me, lately I've seen a LOT of freakin' hockey).  Anyhow, big ups to the Bolts and tune in tomorrow, same diva time, same diva channel for my rant about why I hate baseball and I think its the biggest, dumbest, suckiest sport ever.  (Aside from my disdain for the Yankees and the legions of their "die-hard" fans who only like them 'cause its trendy to.)
