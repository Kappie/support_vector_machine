It be a fairy that will take pride of place on my wall!! The fairies are taking over my world, and I love it!!   THE LAST EVER DAY OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION   Woohoo its such a great feeling to be able to say that at last! Though to behonest the "leavers assembly" was a trifle shit, and I think we could have put on a better presentation. It was a real let down, but afterwards was cool. A group of us went and sat in Sam's (Miss Rawlings) room and chatted! See that we now be my memory of the last ever day, not the utter shambles that was put on before!!   And so the dawn of a new era arises   I am so please to be able to say that my perspective on life has not changed, but it is a new beginning! It is the beginning of a new chapter! That is not say that I am leaving the people in my old chapter behind, if anything I want them to be involved in all the chapters of my life!!  Mwhahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahaha I have a little something for everyone going to the meal!!!!!!!!!! I hope you like it, it is not much, see I have no artistic or creative ability and so it is a bit pants actually.........hmmmmmmmm....................What was I thinking (oh and Char even though you canni make it to the meal.....I shall give you your one at a later date)  Oh yes that also reminds me.............................. .....................Oh buggery I do believe I have forgotten already..................................!!?!???!?!?!?!?!?!?!  ahhhhhhhhhhhh yes that be not it, but another thing,  MY MUM GOT ME A MARILYN MONROE T-SHIRT AND VERY NEARLY AND AUDREY HEPBURN ONE!!    now what the hell was that other thing I e=was going to write about....Why cant I remember.....Oh dear oh dear oh dear Keers's memory is getting worse, if that is at all possible?!?!?!!?!?!!  I really should watch men in black films anymore, they make me think about the universe things! You no like at the end of the first in when then aliens are playing marbles with our galaxy as one marble, and millions of others as other marbles! Then there is the second movie where our universe is one locker in a wall of lockers!! Hmmm I wonder if will ever be able to explore whether that is true, it would be quite weird though. I can just imagine the news reader going:-  This is the 6 o'clock news with me - Darren Jordan today's top story is, we have found the door to the locker!  A team of undercover SAS soldiers are now absailing down to investigate the other locker doors and see if any other universes can be found! It is a highly critical time and we hope to have an update for you in the 10 o'clock programme!!  Anyways I am  REALLY  looking forward to the meal tomorrow!!!  See you then, that is if  I don't see you before, after all my MSN eye is watching you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Much Love Nat xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXxx
