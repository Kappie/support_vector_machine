The Lestrygonians and the Cyclops, the angry Poseidon -- do not fear them: You will never find such as these on your path, if your thought remain lofty, if a fine emotion touches y our spirit adn your body. The Lestrygonians and the Cyclops, the fierce Poseidon you will never encounter, if you do not carry them within your soul, if your soul does not set them up before you.  Pray that the road is long. That the summer mornings are many, when, with such pleasure, with such joy you will encounter ports seen for the first time; stop at Phoenician markets,  and purchase fine merchandise, mother-of-pearl and coral, amber and ebony, and sensual perfumes of all kinds, as many sensual perfumes as you can; visit many Egyptian cities, to learn and learn from scholars.  Always keep Ithaca in your mind. To arrive there is your ultimate goal. But do not hurry the voyage at all. It is better to let it last for many years; and to anchor at the island when you are old,  rich with all you have gained on the way, not expecting that Ithaca will offer you riches.  Ithaca has given you a beautiful voyage. Without her you would have never set out on the road. She has nothing more to give you.  And if you find her poor, Ithaca has not deceived you. Wise as you have become, with so much experience, you must already have understood what Ithacas mean  - Constantine P. Cavafy (1911)  The above poem was given to me at the end of the autumn term by my Greek Archaeology professor, Dr. Michael Cosmopoulos. Referring to the journey home of Odysseus in Homer's poem "The Odyssey," I find it quite fitting to this time in my life, as well as the view I hold of my future...a string of adventures and discoveries making for a life-long journey that ends in my own "Ithaca." For as it is said, it is not the destination that makes for an interesting trip, it is the journey itself.  And so this pale representation of my life comes to pages, poorly written I think, at least in comparison to the tales and lays of old, but hopefully understandable.  A long journey begins with one step at a time.
