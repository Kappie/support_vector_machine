She treated me to dinner. We both ate huge plates of French Toast. It was really fun. We've just recently started hanging out together outside of school or school-related things. It's cool. We get along really well. Today I didn't do much. I made Amanda laugh a whole bunch tho. We were talking about something as she was driving me home from school, and I said "Amanda, you should get a For Sale sign and put it in your car, but don't sell it." and apparently she thought it was one of the funniest things. Her reaction to it was so funny. She just kept laughing. It was great. After school Tommy called me, and asked if I wanted to go to his house and watch a movie with him. I was like 'No, I'm sorry. I'm not feeling good' and he was like 'oh, what's wrong?' and since I didn't want to explain, I was like 'you wouldn't understand' and tommy was all like 'is it special girl stuff?' and I just laughed, and he was like 'that's gross..why'd you tell me that? you could have just lied to me' and then we both laughed, and he was like 'well maybe some other time then' and laughed some more. it was really funny. Oh, yesterday in math it was really funny. Vetta and I were talking, and we noticed that my bangs were really long, so we decided to cut them. I asked kroese where his scissors were, and then i asked if Vetta and I could go to the bathroom. He gave me the WEIRDEST look, so I was like 'oh, my bangs are long. we're gonna go cut them!' and he just laughed. so after we cut them, we're walking out of the bathroom, and I'm like 'thanks vetta...i couldn't have done it alone' and this guy hears us, and he just shakes his head. it was really funny. well, that is really all that has been going on. maybe i'll have some interesting things to blog about soon!
