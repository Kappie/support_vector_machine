I wanna spend my time here with him and just have fun with him while i can, but i dont know either he doesnt get that and he thinks i still will get attached and that i will get hurt no matter what i say..or he just doesnt wanna spend time with me or doesnt care if im here for a limited time. And if thats the case he should just let me know soo i dont waste my time on it i could be doing other things while im here like NOT FUCKING CARE!  It's frusterating to me, because if i just knew exactly and TRUTHFULLY how he felt i could either keep going on caring and wanting to spend time with him adn trying to spend time with him WHILE im here, OR me do my best and not care and not even try to see him or anything. Ya know but i cant read Fucking minds ya know.. i need to know this kinda shit. I wanna SCREAAM i cant take it.  Trying to figure it out makes me just annoyed and frusterated and makes me say FUCK IT and just stop everything. But that mean there is a HUGE chance i wont see him again. and that kills me and i cant take that. I wish soo much i didnt care. I wish i was the kind of person that didnt care about people...the kind of person that didnt give a shit about what other people think, or how they feel. The kind of person that doesnt get attached. I would love that. But thats not me i care about people, i care a little to much.  I dont see how two people could spend time together and seem so happy together and act all in love like.  And Be sweet to each other and just act a certain way and be soo real about it..and only one of the two poeple mean it and truly feel it. It's weird it's just like you never know if somthing is true or not. You never know if somthing is real or not. So i guess its kinda like you have to live your life either never knowing and always guessing, or just asuming that its not. You cant get your hopes up and you cant believe every little thing someone does is becasue they care or they are even being sincere. You gotta take care of yourself, you gotta look out for your self. If there is chance you get hurt, then Fuck it, its only gunna bring pain u dont need it.Fuck IT.. From now on this is what i live by....or at least try.
