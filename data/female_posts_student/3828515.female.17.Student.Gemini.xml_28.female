On top of that, didI mention that our music selection absolutely sucks? Yeah... It's like all Beach Boys music (shudder).Oh well. I'm thinking about going by myself regardless of the"scheduling conflicts" :P.Anyways. So today I went with my mom and my brother to the mall in Oakbrook for the whole day. That was fun. I picked up some new stuff. And that was all I did! Exciting.      Last song I listened to:   Suite From Porgy  Bess  by the Boston Pops.    Last album I listened to:  Soundtrack from Cirque du Soleil's  La Nouba .    Last meal I ate:  Tuna sandwich, rice.    Last movie I watched:   For Your Eyes Only .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I actually am saddened by the fact that we're not going to the U of I Marching Band Festival.    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd: Making marshmallow oxide. Woot.    Last person I talked to:  Erin.    Favorite song today:   Stairway To Heaven  by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.    Favorite food today:  Rice.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Went shopping for the first time in an eternity :P.    Funniest thing that happened today:  My mom sat down in a massage chair at Brookstone and burst out laughing because she claimed it felt like animals were running through the chair. Oh my...
