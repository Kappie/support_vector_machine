I believe in you I'll give up everthing just to find you I have to be with you to live to breathe you're taking over me Have you forgotten all I know and all we had?   Today was pretty normal.BaD AS usual. I didn't go to my last dance recital. I couldn't. I would of cried on stage. Plus I needed to do a lot of studying. Which I did most of. Since I have a french exam tomorow at 9am.Which is two freaking hours long. I am going to wear my yellow hoops from laurie which I got yesterday w/ my american eagle outfitters jeans with my old navy top prolly with the skinny white belt I got for my birthday yesterday.Yesterday I got 30$ to spend at old navy, 50$ from my french grandmother, 20$ from julia, a camera, special shampoo for colored hair. Since my hair is streaked ( or a little more than that) blonde. Its a bit pale but it will change. I also got a cow photo frame then my immortal cd from simon and spend the night by the donnas cd from laurie plus 3 pairs of earings. I feel really sad. I went to farfelu to get a photo album that i WAnted for a long time but it wasn't there. I kind of blame my mom since I have been begging her to get me it for my birthday and she didn't give me my allowence. So there. I am always mad at her. She always does something to mess the relationship. I really do hate her.
