You love to take care of the one you love, and generally you can be a bit overprotective and possessive, but you know, that isn't always such a bad thing. At least you'll be a good mom in the future.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Lol...me? Comforting? Nah...don't really think so.
