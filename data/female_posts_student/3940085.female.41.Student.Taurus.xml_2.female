People wander howI can believe in God but not believe in religion. They are not the same. Religion is organized and there are rules handed down that says you have to do this or that in order to get God's love. I am a recovering catholic myself. They say they are the true church and God says they are. Yea right!!! Do I sound bitter when it comes to the catholic church? I do not believe in the idea of having to go to church to be near God and to win his favor. I am a firm believer that all things have energy and if I want to be close to God I can do it walking near a pond or sitting on my bed.   I guess after all the crap going on with priests I can't help but wander if God is cleaning up their mess. To claim they are holy and hide all the sexual garbage under the rug. The church must do what ever it can to maintain its power over its people. They say that God said the priests should not married. All this was written by a man that had lovers and refused to marry them. The catholic church hates woman. Priests are not allowed to marry because the spouse would obtainhis stuffat hisdeath. The church would get nothing and that would piss them off big time.  Married women in the catholic church are tought that they are to be submissive to their husbands and they are to have sex onlyto satisfy her husbands need and if you get pregnant that's even better because there is another future Catholic to control. Women are to not enjoy sex.   Ok here is the part where Catholics go nuts on me. Come closer and Ill tell you. I firmly believe Jesus was married and that his mother had more children. Oh I know you think I am crazy but if you know anything about the Jewish faith you would understand that it was not acceptable for a Jewish man to not be married at age 30. The catholic church wants others to believe that he was never married and that Mary remained a virgin all her life. Give me a break. No woman could be mans property back then and not give her husband sex. Even inthe writings of Jesus he refers to his brother and sister. Is this writing going any where? Probably not.   I believe in God. I believe in Jesus. I believe in angels. I do not believe in religion!
