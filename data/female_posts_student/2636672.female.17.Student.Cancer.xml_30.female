Throughout high school I've had some really cool people take me under their wing, my freshman year I really had my sister, Raena, and her friends, Paige, Amanda, and Allison looking out for me. Obviously I also had Matthew watching out for me, and when Matthew wasn't there Cory always was.  Sophomore year rolled around...Naner, Paigey, Manda, and Ally were still there for me, but shit happened...And Matt was no longer there...Neither was Cory, because of certain other circumstances, but I made it through...I'd had to do it before. And I wasn't really that upset about the shittiness of it all...I was coping. So I moved on, hung out with Brian 'brybry' McCoy, we started dating...But things didn't work again. The Mr. Jodye Morgan and I were both kind of sulking at a new years party and met, and I realized...He was a cool, and very adorable kid. So Brian and I ended, and Jodye and I started. Jodye and I REALLY had a connection, but deep down everyone...Knew that I still loved Matt. Jodye and I (in my opinion were also growing apart, but considering I SUCK at breaking up with people...It took me  long time to break up with Jodye) So yeah...Anyways When I did finally break up with Jodye he, and all his friends...And everyone else, seemed to think that is was so I could go out with Matt again, but in fact...I didn't start going back out with Matt until the middle of July, because...Honestly...I WASN'T READY TO.  Anyways...So Matt and I were back together :). But Cory was having problems with Emily. Well I get this note from Cory saying he went and read all our old emails to each other and found one that said "I'll always be there for him" and that "he needed me now"...Well...I wasn't there when Cory needed me...And it really make me hurt NOW to realize that I totally let one of my best friends down...Way down.   (right now...I can't really remember WHY I started this post in the first place...But I'm just writing away and it's making me feel really a whole lot better, cause all things are not that great right now)  So now I feel really bad. Because I had realized that there are so so many relationships that I could have let evolve that I didn't throughout my first 3 years in high school. Cory, Cory Hamilton, being the main one.   I've tried calling Cory a couple times this summer, but he's working the night shift, so it's sort of difficult. I really really just want to sit down one day though, and just talk to him all day about all sorts of random things...My yellow shirt, my really good phone reception, recycling, Empty Chair, his work, his life, my life, relationships, and anything else that's EXTREMELY random that we can find to talk about...Because I'm missing Cory right now, and I can't find a real way to just tell him so hopefully he will read this. Cory once said in a post on his site titled "The luckiest guys I know" that "Tori, is probably the coolest girl I've ever met." well I know that Cory is definitely up there on my list...And right now I'm missing him...And I'm not really sure why. But I know I am.   So Cory if you read this...You are the "friend I miss most"  -pink
