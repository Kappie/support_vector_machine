I have to start my AP homework soon though. NOT FUN!  So, right now I am listening to cd 2 oh the 2003 vans warped tour cd. Good Stuff. Also, I am looking at The Early November site and thinking that I am extremely happy that Jeff (the drummer) decided not to leave the band. YAY!  Instead of a song today I thought I would mix it up a little and post some quotes that I think are meaningful. So here we go:  "A true friend is someone who sees the pain in your eyes while everyone else believes the smile on your face"  (courtesy of danielles profile---thanks)  "Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up." -James Baldwin   "A friend is the first one to walk in when the world walks out."   "If you are going through hell, keep going." -Sir Winston Churchill   "We didn't lose the game; we just ran out of time." - Vince Lombardi   "My friend, if I could give you one thing, I would wish for you the ability to see yourself as others see you. Then you would realize what a truly special person you are."- B.A. Billingsly   "I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies."-Pietro Aretino
