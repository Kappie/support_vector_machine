The cages a re overflowing here,if you're to lazy to buy a dog tag then maybe you need to realize that if it had a tag, it would be back home by now(thats painted on the shelter's truck). And for every dog that was brought another cage had to be cleared. The cages were full already and are full now. There is only two ways to clear a cage, adoption or death. Sorry if this is depressing but please people have a heart. Thank you, I hope.            -  Fire Emerald
