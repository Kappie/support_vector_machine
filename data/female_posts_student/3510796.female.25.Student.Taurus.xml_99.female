[T]hey  fail to understand how a person can hold beliefs so      contrary to theirs and still retain any mental acuity.      --Charles   Krauthammer,   ". . .  Why  Bush  Will  Win,"      [1]Washington Post, November 3, 2000       With  unusual  acuity,  one  of  the wire service reporters      pounced on that possibility with an insinuating question.      --Alfred Alcorn, [2]Murder in the Museum of Man       Monkeys,  diurnal animals that have a high visual acuity --      necessary for finding food and for moving through the trees      without  bumping  into  things  or  missing one's hold on a      branch -- have a large visual area of the neocortex.      --Stephen Budiansky, [3]If a Lion Could Talk       Horses  tend to shy a lot because the construction of their      eyes  is  optimized  for  a  near 360-degree field of view,      useful  for  spotting  danger, but the price the horse pays      for  that  is  relatively poor acuity and some out-of-focus      spots  that  can  cause objects within the field of view to      suddenly sail into sharp focus.      --Stephen Budiansky, [4]If a Lion Could Talk           Acuity  comes  from Latin acutus, "sharpened, pointed, acute,"    past participle of acuere, "to sharpen."
