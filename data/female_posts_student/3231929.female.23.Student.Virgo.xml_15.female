Had a very interesting clinic with a very chatty paediatrician who gave us a quick tutorial on Occam's Razor - essentially this is the theory that if explanations are stipped down to the simplest theory, this is the most likely reason. (Will have to look this up in fursther detail, but it interested me)  Had a sore throat all day, and was feeling a bit feverish at times, so dosed myself with paracetamol or aspirin and things seemed better.  Weather still clammy. Have just tidied room.
