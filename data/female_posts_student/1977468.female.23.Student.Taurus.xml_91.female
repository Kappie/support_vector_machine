I can't keep up with them. I'm so alone.   Dave Agnor Scrivener  English 101 - 1pm April 27 ‘04 - Paper #1, Second draft  	Whoa there, Mr. John Wayne. Think your cool huh? Yeah, Punk? Well then answer this question. What is cool? Huh? Yeah, I thought as much. Maybe you should go read my source material, the “Merchants of Cool” interview with John Seabrook, then come back and we’ll “rap” about it. Curious? Typical. But before you read on realize this; this paper isn’t about you, its about my response to the summarized text. The interview discusses the relation between the commercial media and the ever-growing market of teenage consumers. It mostly talks about Music Television (forthwith known as MTV). I’ve categorized what I consider the key points of it into the following sub-topics: the Targeted Audience, Feedback loops, and Mass vs Subculture. I agree with almost everything Seabrook says, but I disagree on his apathetic attitude toward the effects and causes of what makes what he says true. Seabrook isn’t connecting all the dots, only the ones which lead away from personal responsibility. 	The targeted audience of these “Merchants of Cool” are the young folk, more specifically people ages 18 to 24. Several factors place this demographic apart from the older and younger crowds. As a whole, teenagers represent an incredible spending power. A person reaching teenager-dom for the first time not only has a large amount of disposable income, but also has influence on how the income of their parents is spent. Marketers have concluded that the only reoccurring sellable product to this cash cow is what the cow deems “cool”. The eternal struggle with marketing the Cool lies in this group’s “anti-conforming” tendencies. As soon as something becomes widespread and marketed, the Cool appeal is lost. This is the nature of trends. The marketers are therefore driven to detect what the next Cool will be, and drive it home to the bank as early and as long as possible before switching to the next sellable trend. Seabrook states that another perk to appealing to this demographic lies in their psychological stage of development. 18 to 24 are the formative years of a person’s life. Often their lifetime preference of music, clothes and brands are decided during this time. The belief is that if you can sell them on your brand during this time, they will be return customers for the remainder of their life. 	I agree with Seabrook, although he is no prophet in regards to this fact. I find what he states especially true for brands which tend to raise hobbyists and enthusiasts into a kind of loyalty. I’ve seen this happen personally with people’s attitudes towards vehicle companies, genres of music, and musical instruments such as the Fender vs Gibson argument. I believe this is because while people form their identities in a materialistic society, they will often use their possessions and preferences in products to define their identity to the public. How often have I heard people argue the classic “Pepsi vs Coke” debate? An innumerable amount of times, all in the halls of my highschool. I agree with Seabrook on his stances with the targeted demographic of MTV, although what he says above is well known across the fields of marketing, sociological, and psychological research. They really are not unique enough to be an opinion of his own as they are generally regarded as true. 	The phenomena of the in-out cycle is not attributed to, but rather accelerated by MTV’s main technique for discovering and selling cool, the “Feedback Loop”. The basic mechanics of this system are simple; the effects are profoundly diverse. MTV researches upcoming trends by finding trend-setters and interviewing average teens in the major cities, where most fads are born. From the processed information they gather, they decide whom to air, what clothes the hosts should wear, which genres are going in and out, and generally what teenagers want or don’t want. Thus they design their programming, coincidently forcing the Cool out of the trend while the money flows in. They then gather more information, rinse and repeat. This is how Seabrook explains the loop.  	What he is more reluctant to divulge are the effects the programming has on determining the next Cool. The true brilliance of the “loop” illustration lies in the looping effect MTV has on the teenage culture. This is due to the fact that because it is using Cool, a cultural concept, the programming becomes a cultural entity. They sell a lifestyle and an attitude through the CD’s they choose to market, the people they choose to display and the nature of the shows they air. They sell a culture back to the original culture which is not a pure representation of the latter, it is laced with money making motives. The information they “process” on teenagers is not to understand them but to understand what MTV has or can find that they would buy, be it a detrimental or positive societal influence. Seabrook’s defense to this has been the argument that they are only displaying what people are already doing. He states: 	“Now that we have the web, where there are plenty of websites like ‘darefordollars.com,’ where you can pay someone to do something really gross, like cover themselves in dogshit. It puts together the audience with the people that are willing to do that. And so there you see something beyond MTV... I don’t think it’s entirely driven by the needs of programmers to get people’s attention.”  	My counter argument is that they are not displaying an accurate representation of what “people” as a whole are doing, but what certain people are doing that is marketable. MTV is over-representing a select few, causing many of the blank-slate feedable teenagers to absorb the culture as their own. They take the piece of mass culture and spread it around nation-wide, making it a trend. I believe as often as they predict trends they create them. They also a catalyst for the behavior they choose, not just mirrors of an MTV parallel society. 	Deeply correlated to the Feedback Loop are the concepts of Mass culture and Subculture. Seabrook explains how these two ideas interact to show why the feedback loop operates in the manner it does. People in general, but especially teens want to absorb and be a part of an authentic culture. They use the media as access to Mass culture. The problem with the Mass culture is that it in itself is not a separate culture, but in fact a collaboration of countless smaller subcultures throughout the nation. Mass culture by definition cannot be authentic, because it is a set of compressed and processed ideals meant to be packaged and distributed. Subcultures are a much less calculated, they emerge from the sociological characteristics of humanity. They are more authentic, and therefor more sellable to a culture deprived youth. Seabrook ends there, but I don’t think that’s where the issue ends. 	I believe a teen’s struggle to find authentic culture is rooted in the merging of the Mass cultures and Subcultures through the vehicle of the media. If one spends more time watching television then one does in school, society’s traditional institution for socializing the youth, then I would argue by means of exposure the person is more socialized to the mass media then their own hometown subculture. My experience growing up reflects this. Often when my peers reminisce about their childhood and those childhood memories, they are only comparing with each other which kids shows they watched growing up and which their parents would not allow them to. Evidence of this phenomena are everywhere, most ironically though it’s appearing at the mall. Walking through trendy teen department stores you’ll find t-shirts of Nintendo game characters, Ninja Turtle t-shirts and G.I. Joe stickers. This at first might seem odd, but they sell remarkably well to teenagers who embrace these nostalgic icons of their childhood. They are referencing to a past subculture which only appears authentic because at the time they experienced it they were too young to tell the difference. All these are sold under the soft glow of MTV and VH1 monitors hanging overhead. Being socialized at early ages to the Mass culture has deprived kid’s of a healthy amount of authentic subculture. When kids decide it’s time to rebel, they look to that same source of Mass culture. After all, television is where they have gotten their reference of cultural identity in the past. In a sad way this encourages the mass media to copy and exploit more authentic subcultures. These cultures are turned over to the trend makers like quick fixes for a culture addicted teen society. One that will never get a permanent fill through the media, only a sampling board of choices which leave them ultimately hungry for their own unique identity. 	Everything Seabrook said is true, yet how he portrayed the connotations of what he said I would argue to be false. Perhaps the media's interactions with teenagers represent less of a cultural mirror, and more of an economical device; less of a mathematical equation then an unstoppable force of an evolving and technologically adjusting world society. Graphing the progression of this trend would lend me to believe that it will get much worse before it's passed.
