And as I was printing out said brief outline last night, I realized it's not actually due until tomorrow.  For a moment, I was crushed.  But then I realized that I would not have gotten as much done during those two days had I allowed the extra day of work today.  So, as a result, I'm ready to tackle this week on all fronts and chip away from the Break's work-load as much as possible.  Have the last 6 cases to read for the brief assignment all ready and waiting to be highlighted and possibly incorporated into the outline.  Oh yea.  So smooth.    And to top it all off, we're supposed to edge toward the 60s today.  Degrees, that is, not the decade; but that would kick ass, too.    And can I just say how much I love the   urlLink mayor of Seattle?
