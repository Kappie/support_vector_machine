Today's been an okay day. I hate walking around, my legs are killing me from running. Thank God the seasons almost over. So yeah, I hope I don't get in trouble for this, never know how my school will take me blogging when I should be looking up chemystery or something. Today afer school I have so much to do. I have track then I'm going tanning and then I have to go to the mall and find an after prom outfit. Well I'm out. I think the bell is gonna ring soon. x0x
