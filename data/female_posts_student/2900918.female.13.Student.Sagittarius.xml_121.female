The phone in the LR [living room for short]is spoilt and my whole family depends on the phone in my room. oh, its the same line, just two diff phones.  so im pretty irritated cuz it get "missing" a lot since its cordless.  um..  um..  um.  sorry, this post is the most [rhymes!!!!] pointless post. I don't even know why I did this  urgh, forget it.  *walks over, places both hands on your head [no, this is no sex story for those with exceptional minds who think it is] and erases your memory of what you've just read*
