Boys/girls you wanted kiss and date, wars with eneimies to be healed. Changes to start anew come about, and begin to develope. Some of these things are good, and bring good to others. Others are good for one, but bad for the rest.   And then comes me. Even though I want to go more than anything else in the world, I fear, because of the lack of fundraisign effort, that I will not make it to Edmonton this year. My highlight of my life, taken away, if you will. Because as you see, connecting with Canadian UU's is way better than going to the PNWD. We have ways to go, a lady at our Neighboorhood group told us that the youth at Calgary had a bottle drive - perhaps we'll start that here.   I've made a lot of friends since my trip to Kelowna. Lots. And I try my hardest to stay in touch with them, email, MSN, snail, and eventually, blog. So I can at least know what's going on with them, and be there when it appears someone is needed. My soul right now, is even in Calgary, with one of my friends.  And with the new year, they feel the need to move on. I don't blame them. Start memories anew. Unfortuanatly, that means I can't keep up with them. I'm locked in a corner nobody sees, until around the beginning of May to the approximate end of summer. A seasonal friend.  And then I realize how self-centered this sounds, and hit myself for it.   Better days and weeks wished upon you Sanford and Erin. Maybe I'll see you this year.
