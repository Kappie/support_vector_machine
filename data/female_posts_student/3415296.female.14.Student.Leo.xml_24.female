I asked him to wait for me after school because I wanted to talk to him. I came out of school and he was gone. I waited there 'til 4 I guess. Later I waited at Krystal's house. We called his house, he wasn't home. Walking home someone probably. It was 4:30, so I left her house and started walking home. Met Vincent on the way, he asked why I was walking home now. I said I was waiting for someone, but they never showed up. He probably thought I was crazy. I walked all the way to Headwaters, when I realized that I didn't need to. I passed through the pond, I sat there for a while. Walked back home, and settled on from there.  I guess he doesn't even want to be friends. I understand that he wants to be with someone else, but just for one day I wanted to talk. As friends. I don't know anymore. That's probably why he was ignoring me on the Sudbury trip. The boat ride was different. He would be the opposite of me from everywhere. If I was on the second floor, him the first. It just goes on from there. Krystal tells me not to think about him, she says he's stupid. I don't think that. I guess he just has different feelings.   Ashley saved me today. I have to thank her a lot. Without her I think I would be dead by now. Anoosh just MSGed me. He said if I was okay. I said I was fine and showed that I had a happy face on. I don't know. I really don't know. I guess that's it. I just don't know about everything..
