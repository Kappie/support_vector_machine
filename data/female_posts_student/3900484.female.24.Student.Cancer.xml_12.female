I am that shallow. Show me that you want me and I'll never leave... (oops!) Anyway. Dragging myself to my computer this evening, I am slowly now attempting to get on with my career driven life. UGH. If I ever decide that I actually want to be married, it will be difficult to learn how to do acceptable social interaction with boys. They are another species, in a sense, and I don't understand them. I do like  urlLink this book  which says they will die out in 125,000 years though.
