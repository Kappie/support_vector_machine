The cliche, "the thunder rolls" is damn near pin point precision...The clouds are purple, at sunset at least, and they tumble through the sky..So, I was watching "Who wants to marry my Dad?" (because my life lacks reality) when those annoying orange banners creeping along the bottom of the screen insisted on reminding me that we were all going to die sometime between the hours of 9-11PM, due to some tornado watch.  My brother and my cousin run outside so they can play Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton and save Peoria...every five minutes they would update me on the color of the sky...  Unusual for ,my normally, paranoid self I stayed spray painted to their couch, praying that Meredith would pass the lie detector test on the show...she had great hair...Then, the sirens went off, loud tortuous alarms saying,"wooh woooh wooooooh."  I jumped up, looked around, said to myself, where would I anchor myself incase winds exceeding 120mph were suddenly in my face...I asked my cousin where to run in the event of an evacuation..he responded with what siren, what evacuation, scenario could've been compared to car alarms going off in any major city or a woman screaming help in the darkness....  Well, 11PM passed and noone died....rain and lightning continued till morning when the siren went off again at 9AM...I ran downstairs and everyone is seated around the dining table drinking tea or coffee, my aunt smiles and says ," OH..that's the testing system for the tornado warning siren goes off every first tuesday of every month..."  what a relief, huh???
