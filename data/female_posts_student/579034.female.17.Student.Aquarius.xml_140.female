I don't hide it too well either, everyone's been askin me if I'm okay, do I feel sick, am I going to throw myself in front of a bus... you know, those same old questions. Yeah. I'm kinda bummed out I won't get to hang out with my friends this weekend, I mean four days is a long span of time and it would have been great to see them all with out track or something looming before us or anything. One good thing did happen today. Mr. Turner, my art teacher, said that he is going to get Mrs. Volpe to change my schedule around so next year I might be taking Advanced Art cause, and I quote, Mr. Turner said "I see some real potential for a great talent in you." Thank you Mr. Turner. I'm sorry for all the mean things I have ever said about you, your homosexuality, or your funny beard. He did make me feel happy with myself. I mean, I'd rather do art then Physics. ::Quiver:: Physics. What possesed me to write that down I'll never know. Not like I want to do anything in the science feild any ways.  So yeah, tonight promises to be a bad night. I really wanna go out and do something but everyone has a life that has no need for a Lauren in it. So I'll probably just do laundry, pack, and start my two essays that I have to do for history.  Canadians, if you read this, I should be on MSN toinght. Hope to catch yous on thea.  x0x
