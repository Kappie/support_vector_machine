My mom walked my sister up the aisle since my parents are divorced and my sister insisted that Mom do it not DAD.  As you might filter, my sister holds a lot of animosity towards my dad.  My brother in law even tried to settle the disagreements but my sister Marie just wont have it.  The market is up right now.  I hope it stays there.  For those of you that are watching the economy, pay close attention to those Oil Futures.  If they start rising significantly, be prepared for a war with IRAQ.  Ching, what a mess Jen has made.  Awaiting the further exploits...  ~Net
