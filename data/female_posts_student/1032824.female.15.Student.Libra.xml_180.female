Dumm dee dum...       Things to do after MT 'O's : x Watch Harry Potter x Watch The Day After Tomorrow x Watch Shrek 2 x Kayaking 2 Star course x Shopping spree x Girls night out at Jiax's + Chocolate Mousse cake baking!!      There is this song by Meredith Brooks entitled " Bitch " and part of the chorus goes a little something like this:  I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother, I'm a sinner, I'm a saint  So I asked Jeremy to pick one of those words which best describes me, and he picked,  mother . Haha ;)
