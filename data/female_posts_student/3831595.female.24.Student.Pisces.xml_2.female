I emailed Leslie and she said that they would take care of it, but that was in the middle of May and it's still not taken care of.  I wouldn't be too concerned, but I vaguely remeber Alison saying something about them having Christian registered wrong and they hassled him about it.  Gotta love the ed dept...
