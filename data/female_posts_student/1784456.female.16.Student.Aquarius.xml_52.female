Oh, I might as well phone Laura. Mmm I keep thinking about my pom-pom coat! Hehe...maybe I should go and search for it! Hmm...dodgey government! They're putting a programme on about teachers. Think they're hinting something? Oh I mucked this up by putting a poll on, but don't worry, I took it off. Umm I'm looking at some one talking a class full of boys...hey! I know what you're thinking! Hehe, a kid asked do you feel imtimidated by us! Wish I had the nerve...hehe... Fun, teaching? Don't those usually not mix? I really should change the channel and get off the net. Oh and if any one finds my marbles e-mail me at  urlLink notyetcracked@hotmail.com  Or find another way of annoying me. (See Izzy)
