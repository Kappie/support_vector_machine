And I'm a crazy computer geek. :-P I wish I had something interesting or inspiring to say. Heck, I just wish something interesting or inspiring would happen in my life. I'm such a horribly boring person. Ah well, the holiday season is here, and unlike past years, I plan on really enjoying it.  I just realized that I haven't written in my actual journal is months. Isn't that sad? And yet I write in here almost every day. Pathetic. Okay, I'm gonna go watch Star Wars: Episode 2. Hehe...see you crazies later.
