I hope to purchase two Survivor buffs for a charity auction. A yellow buff which represents the Saboga Tribe consisting of Jenna Lewis, Rudy Boesch, Rupert Boneham, Tina Wesson and Ethan Zohn and a green buff which represents the Mogo Mogo tribe consisting of Lex van den Burghe, Jenna Morasca, Richard Hatch, Colby Donaldson, Kathy Vavick-O'brien, and Shii Ann Huang with monies going to Ethan and Jenna's favourite charities. :)
