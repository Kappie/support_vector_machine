They don't even notice; I am just another random person,    scurrying on my way. This is how they see me. Little do they know, Who I am, What I do, What I'm about.  I am a people watcher. I sit and observe, I watch, I learn, I imitate. You disreguard me; I digest you. I watch your every move I weigh it in my mind    against myself and others I want to improve me and learn Learn about people, and human ways.  I am a people watcher, I watch you.
