Then I got a new pair of jeans form AE and a shirt for when it gets warmer.  In sears I went to the Clinique counter and this cute guy was working in cosmetics - like I have never even heard of a guy in cosmetics!  So yeah he was cute, and we were looking for some makeup for the wedding even though it's not til' may, but the guy was like - "do you want me to do your makeup"and I was like "Y-E-S."  So then he did one eye and then showed me how to do it like he did, it was really neat.  He showed me how to apply my eye liner and mascara because those two things I have never worn before.  It was really neat, and like I also got this lipgloss stuff - #7 Sugarblue.  Now that is some cool stuff and I also picked up this shimmer stuff with the happy perfume in it.  Oh I am beginning to like cosmetics - I get it now when people like make-up.  Of course I don't wear any to school though because I mean when would I have any time to put it on.  Saving it for special occasions makes it all the better.   Actually it was really warm yesterday.  There is actually sun again today too!  I love the sun.  It's like when I wake up I am blinded by light and I don't feel so depressed.  Semester II is so much better you know.  I mean I confess though that I do miss Chem.  I actually miss it ALOT!  I guess I spend like my life in that class - during class and tutorial and now it's like a part of me is missing.  I didn't realize how much I enjoyed it, until I didn't have it anymore.  Bio I think is good now though.  Of course I am not friends with many people in that class because they are mostly grade 10's, but for the group assignment I met this really nice girl, Lisa, and there is this other really nice girl, Aaron, that sits next to me.  I feel a little more comfortable in that class now then I did at the beginning.  It was really awkward and everything and well I am not sure what I think of these projects that we have to do and then like "teach" the class.  It's a little odd, because like usually we wouldn't do something like that for Bio.  I am afraid that I might not be able to learn the material as well as if it were taught.  But whatever happens I am going to know my stuff, cause studying will actually pay off in Bio, where as Chem not so much because it's a lot of application of your knowledge, rather than the just straight forward information of what you know.
