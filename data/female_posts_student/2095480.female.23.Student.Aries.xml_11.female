Liz: holy cow Liz: that is my spring break Richard: well you want to go? Liz: (that's a resounding hell yeah) Richard: bc I have a ticket with your name on it Liz: you are so awesome Richard: you will be round out the family five Liz: HOLY COW Richard: MC Me Mom Dad and You Liz: that is going to be so cool  I don't know how he manages to do and organize things like this, but he does a good job of it. I'm excited, I've never seen a performance by these guys, it ought to be great!  ~~~~  In other news....   1)  Don't get me wrong about  VSO  - I do love doing my work with it. What gets to me is the bitter/cranky/tired therefore I'll get fussy attitudes that performers [and others] get with me. I know when there is a problem, no reason to cuss at me, no reason to fuss at me, no reason to tell me that it must be fixed NOW BY GOD b/c... I know! Just tell me about the problem... and I'll fix it. For the love of god there is no need to yell at me.  END OF RANT.    2)  Regarding the hugs... does it maybe have something to do with reassurance? I think that might be part of it too. Keeping in mind I only hug best of friends, maybe subconsciously I am reassured by hugs that they are on my side. Sounds strange perhaps, but that is probably part of it.   3)  I am tired of my  Leadership and Conflict Management Class  of getting canceled. Yeah, that's right. It is canceled so often its not even funny. In the last two weeks, we've met a total of 2 hrs, and its a 3 hr class.    4)  I WASHED MY  CAR!  Those that have seen it know how much it needed this. Did you know that my car is blue?? I had forgotten.  Take care, Goodnight.   "Mishaps are like knives, that either serve us or cut us, as we grasp them by the blade or the handle. ~ James Russell Lowell (1819-1891)
