After everything I've gone through to not be "Ronda," "Randi," and various names beginning with "B", I understand more than most what it's like to have an irregular name.  2.  Sabrina, you did not drink nearly enough to justify being a Master of the Arts, but congratulations anyway because you are now officially more educated than I am.  3.  The fuckers at Taco Bell can kiss my ass, regardless of what drunken Sabrina and Michele say.  They are incompentent bastards who need to be reminded not to ejaculate in customers' orders.    4.  I beat everyone to the punch on this post, meaning that my version of events is the one that goes for this evening.  If anyone would like to question what happened tonight, I suggest that they stay up late enough and have enough manual dexterity to blog at 2:33am.  Otherwise, my story is the inerrant, capital T truth.  I win.
