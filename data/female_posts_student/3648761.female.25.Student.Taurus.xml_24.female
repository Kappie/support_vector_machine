She wound up hitting on some really old guy that is about 65 and looks like Jack Nicholson. Amazing what beer googles will make you see.  The guy was really ugly. Anyway, I am not feeling to good today, I had way too many drinks.  My mom wanted to play tennis today, and I am glad a thunderstorm is comming because I dont think I'd do very well.   Went to see the Notebook, it was exactly what I wanted very romantic, and of course I cried.  Well nothing exciting going on this weekend, except I have to do some major cleaning, my friend Christine will be here, less than a week.  I am excited about the following weekend.  This Saturday, I am going out with Miguel, and my sister. I always have a great time when I go out with Miguel , he loves giving straigt men blow jobs.  He is the minster of gay men. Loves going out to straight bars to see how many he can turn. (You'd be surprised) It's quite hilarious.
