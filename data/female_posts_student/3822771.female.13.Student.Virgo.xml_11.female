Look, if someone wrote a play just to glorify  What's stronger than hate, would they not arrange the stage  To look as if the hero came too late he's almost in defeat  It's looking like the Evil side will win, so on the Edge  Of every seat, from the moment that the whole thing begins  It is...   Chorus:  Love who makes the mortar  And it's love who stacked these stones  And it's love who made the stage here  Although it looks like we're alone  In this scene set in shadows  Like the night is here to stay  There is evil cast around us  But it's love that wrote the play...  For in this darkness love can show the way   So now the stage is set. Feel you own heart beating  In your chest. This life's not over yet.  so we get up on our feet and do our best. We play against the  Fear. We play against the reasons not to try  We're playing for the tears burning in the happy angel's eyes  For it's...    These are the lyrics to the song that they played at Gregs funeral..i believe they have such a powerful meaning, love does conquer all..althougoh we sometimes doubt what love is and what effect it can have, love is gods biggest gift to us...but why cant we understand what love is until its gone? Cant we ever notice how good we have things, before they leave us..   Greg...only one word can describe why i miss greg so much..and thats love. Love, why didnt i realize what i had before he left..i sure wish i had! i miss greg so much!! :')
