I dont wanna move at all.. but I dont think I will have a choice but I told my dad moving is going to ruin my life.. :( I feel bad because I dont think theres anything he can do u kno? but everyones giving him a really hard time about it but I dont wanna leave WAYNE.. or my friends.. :-( Oh well.. I guess I just have to go with the Flow.. even though I kno if I dont put up a fight then he wont even think about staying here..   Well.... I had the Best weekend.. It was awesome.. I am scared tho... cuz I have fallen so in Love with Wayne.. and I might be leaving him in only a few months.. The more I try not to think about it .. The more I think about not thinking about it and end up thinking about it.. lol.. (did that make sense?)  Um.. Lets see the new drama in my life right now would be moving... and JD bitching at me. He thinks I am being unfair and I am ditching him for my boyfriend...Im not denying it because I am but he wont leave it alone.. he keeps saying how fucked up that is but in all honesty.. he would/did do the same thing to me and I didnt say shit to him because I knew how much he loved the person he was ditching me for.  I cant believe how awesome this weekend was.. Friday was the perfect day! Me n Wayne hung out .. and So many things happened.. I cant believe how perfect it was. Then Saturday wayne met my dad for the first time.. wow.. that was scary lol.. but I think my dad was impressed so Im happy..   Well.. Im out cuz I have to do the dishes.. Yay :/ lol..
