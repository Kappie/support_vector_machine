This time no call from my friend, Matt, the one I told you about yesterday. Anyways, I took a shower....cleaned the house....did the laundry, woke up my sister and told her to go in the shower...and called my mom to see who had called me earlier. That's pretty much it. Yesterday my mom nearly killed herself with the lawn mower. She was outside mowing the lawn and then it started to rain. Did that stop her? Nooooo...she kept on mowing. Then it started to thunder...and you could tell the lightning was near, did that stop her? Nooo....she kept on mowing until she was done. I swear she is stubborn. I just hope I don't become as stubborn or nearly as stubborn as she is. Then this morning I found out that one of my mom's cousin's or relatives died this morning. I knew who he was but I like didn't know him enough to were I would be weary and all down the whole day. I mean don't get me wrong...I am sad that had happend. I jsut hope my momma will be okay. I guess since that happend I have to go out of town this weekend and I really don't want to. If I do, then I want to tell my mom that I want to see my dad. Now that's another story. You see what happend was that my dad had left us when I was in the 8th grade..which was almost 3 years ago. He had been cheating on my mom with her best friend...and ugh..everything was just chaos. I mean..that was my mom's best friend. When my mom had found out that my dad had been cheating on her..she went to her friend...but my mom never he was with her friend..she alwasys thought it was someone else...but then she found out...Boy was she mad. I was pretty upset too. But I was soo close to my dad...we were like best friends..then all of a sudden he just leaves. But yeah...I haven't seen him since the week after Valentines Day this year. Oh yeah and another thing, my mom found out about this whole cheating thing like 2 days after Valentines Day. That kinda sucks. Well I guess I better get going now...sorry for the whole story..there's much more to it...leave a comment or something if you want to know more. Later!
