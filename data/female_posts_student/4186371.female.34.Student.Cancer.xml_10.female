It was supposed to start tomorrow but plans have changed. That's fine with me. At least this month isn't as busy as last month where I was home only 7 days out of the month. But, unfortunately, it still means I'm busy enough to miss going to L.A. to see my best friend and her new house. IT SUCKS!!! Not the making money part though. That's kind of nice. Okay, okay, that's really nice especially since it's definite now that my dad's last major account will not have enough money to continue to put out a newspaper, which means I lose a lot of money. I love pet sitting and all but I don't like the uncertainty of where money's going to be coming in from. I mean, I've had 2 pet sitting clients cancel on me already and when 9/11 happened a few years back all my pet sitting clients canceled their trips. See? You never know when the gravy train will fall off the tracks. And now that pet sitting is pretty much my sole income, it's kind of scary. It certainly doesn't make me feel comfortable. But I guess everyone has this problem at some point in their life. I'm just learning to rely on God. I know there's no other way I could have gotten all these jobs. People are coming out of the woodwork and my regular clients are suddenly booking 2, 3 times as usual. It's all very strange... and wonderful. However, it does keep me in a constant, subdued state of panic that my clients will cancel on me for whatever reason.       Okay, I'm finally tired enough to try to get some sleep. I better turn on the fan, it's stuffy in this room. Good night.
