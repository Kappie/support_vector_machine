Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t love every holiday, but this one definitely has my vote for best overall holiday –I mean what other holidays yields you a tree full of presents?  Of course there are other reasons why this is a great holiday, reasons that most people forget completely.  Christmas is the celebration of the savior of the human race, I’d say that makes it a pretty important time of year.  So, while your opening one of those gifts wrapped under your tree, stop and take a moment to say thanks to the guy who really deserves it…  Merry Christmas, again…  I also wanted to share this story with you.  "The Candymaker’s Witness"  A Candymaker in Indiana wanted to make a candy that would be a witness, so he made the Christmas Candy Cane.  He incorporated several symbols of the birth, ministry and death of Jesus Christ.  He began with a stick of pure white, hard candy.  White to symbolize the Virgin Birth, and the sinless nature of Jesus, and hard to symbolize the Solid Rock, the foundation of the Church, and firmness of the promises of God.  The Candymaker made the candy in the form of a “J” to represent the precious name of Jesus, who came to earth as our Savior.  It could also represent the staff of the “Good Shepherd” with which He reaches down into the ditches of the world to lift out the fallen lambs who, like all sheep, have gone astray.  Thinking that the candy was somewhat plain, the Candymaker stained it with red stripes.  He used three small stripes to show the stripes of the scourging Jesus received by which we are healed.  The large red stripe was for the blood shed by Christ on the cross so that we could have the promise of eternal life.   Unfortunately, the candy became known as a Candy Cane, a meaningless decoration seen at Christmas time.  But the meaning is still there for those who “have eyes to see and ears to hear”.  I pray that this symbol will again be used to witness To The Wonder of Jesus and His Great Love that came down at Christmas and remains the ultimate and dominant force in the universe today.
