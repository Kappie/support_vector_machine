And these two girls I know were talking about their hair. And as they were talking they started to look at me with one of those "your looking at us while we're talking" looks that can only be answered with a more prolific stare, the kind that tends to warrent inspection from the recipent. So one of them wanted to know what I thought about the topic, and I told them.  I said that my angle, is that from the larger perspective, a mere generation after they die all the details of their lives will be reduced to two documents lying somewhere in a government vault, a birth certificate and a death certificate.  People will be unlikey to even know the most prized accomplisments of their lives, much less the hairstyle they predicted would be cool during the spring of 2004.  From the cosmic eye, the most prolific triumphs of mankind are less then nothing, no more or less significant then a handful of dust stiring on the dark side of a phantom planet in a solar system of one of the many billions of galaxies hurling to and fro in gravitational dances occuring long before we even knew what a star was.  Nations falling, the greatest men in our history are reduced to factoids, the answers to questions on gameshows people watch to relax after work.  Mankind's ignorance to the universe is as uncalculatable as mankind's ignorance to itself and where it stands in the universe. Millions of people are born and die thinking about nothing but what they are going to wear the next day. And eventaully the universe will colapse upon itself, all trace of our existance gone.  This really isn't the kind of opinion on hairstyles people like to hear. I had to defend my statement, which is true, by telling them things matter in the eternal sense. They already knew that though.  So they changed to subject to something else.  I think it was shoes?
