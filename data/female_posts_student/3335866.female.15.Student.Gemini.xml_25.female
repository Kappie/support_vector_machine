If y'all feel like dropping by, I'm staying with the two nicest, most generous people to ever 'bless yer heart'- my (great)-aunt and uncle. Just to recap, my grandparents, sister, and I have been travelling since we left New England on Saturday, and we got here yesterday. We've also stopped at my maternal great-aunt's house and Niagara Falls, which I won't really discuss here. Also worth mentioning is the night we spent in the most hideous motel known to mankind- or at least, the most disgusting one my grandparents ever stayed in. But anyway- Indiana.   It is not quite an odd place, but it's so different than my city full of liberal, worldly, agnostic, cynical people that I feel compelled to brand it as such. When we pulled into the driveway yesterday there was not a cloud in the sky or a non-suburban house to be seen. All the trees had obviously been planted when the houses were built, scant decades ago, and it felt strange after living with hundred-year-old maples my whole life. The hundreds of cornfields I was used to, at least- my family took a 'road trip' through the Midwest a few years back. The people were different, too. I know people have phonetically spelled out Southern sentences ("Why, ay DEEclare! You've grown more'n a cornstalk in a rainstorm in JEWly!") much too often, so I'll refrain. I think that I can feel myself speaking differently already, though. I hope I am. Words sound much prettier here- easier to say, and not so harsh. When I contrast my sister's voice to soft Southern tones I find that the latter are much nicer.   I started this out wanting to talk about specific events. I was going to talk about today's artery-freezing lunch at a fish fast food joint, or about my aunt and uncle, or how Niagara Falls smelled like rotten fish. But I didn't. These entries never do turn out how I'd like them to- they're too unclear, for one thing. If you can put together half of what I've been going on about I'll congratulate you. Oh, well. I know I'm getting better, anyway. I can tell that my entries are more interesting than in previous blogs, and half the time I even get across the point I was trying to make. I'll just have to keep on striving to improve.   Currently Reading:  The Bell Jar  and  Why Girls Are Weird . The first is slightly overrated and the second slightly underrated. Both are pretty good. Can't go into much detail at the moment, as I think I'm going to be called to join the others for a game of cards at any moment. Talk to y'all later.
