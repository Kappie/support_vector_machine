If you are not to busy with volleyball, that is.  Satpreet, I am heartily in favor of starting a Liberal Support Group. Just think, my great idea would be the first in the country (that I know of!), and we can voice our 'liberal' ideas in safety. Not that we weren't safe before, (after all, what harm could those evil republicans do to the mighty liberals? ok... beat us in the presidential election, but hey...) its just that now, we have 'support'. Which just makes it sound important. Like Alcoholics Anonymus.  *Stands up*  Hi, my name is Katherine, and in this country over run with conservative conspiracys, I am proud to be a Liberal.  *Group Claps*  Hi Katherine, and welcome. We join together here today to shout our liberal voices loud, so much so that Presdient Bush will become deaf, and our noble ways will triumph!!  *Bon fire dance commences, ritual animal scarifices are committed, scattered praying to the heathen gods are seen, and howlings at the moon are heard*  *Gets up from drinking the blood of a chicken* Golly-gee-gosh guys, that sure was a fun time! See ya next Thursday! I'll see you, Bob, in 4th period!  *Looks up from watching the orgy* See ya, Katherine! Oh, and can you bring the refreshments next time?
