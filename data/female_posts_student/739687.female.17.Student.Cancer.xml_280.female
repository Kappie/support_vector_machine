So me and Rachel pull up at Starbucks...and I'm about to get out of her car, n the window is down but there is that front window thing that's still up of course. And something compells me to lean forward as I'm hopping out rather quickly. And I gashed my head on the corner of that window, so i have a huge cut down the side of my face. So it looks like I got in a fight. Lovely, but hilarious. I was cracking up, it was greatness. Except for the redness and swelling and stinging around the temple area.  I have been soooo accident prone lately! Oh my GOSH...it's not cool. Saturday, I cut my knee on the corner of my bed while I was making it. Monday or Tuesday I slipped while getting in the shower, and hit my shin. Wednesday I cut my finger on our cracked stove (lousy lousy piece of shit...I was like 'omg it's cracked...' so i ran my finger along it, not realizing it was cutting me), and then later that night I nearly broke my middle finger by smashing it while opening a cabinet door. And now this. Could I be much more cursed? Am I really that unlucky?  Why won't my luck just change for once???  Not only am I physically jinxed, but everything else pretty much sucks lately as well.   Sometimes it seems as if I have the worst luck in the world.   And I have kickboxing tomorrow. So I should probably sleep.  Be careful, crazies. It's a cruel and dangerous world out there.
