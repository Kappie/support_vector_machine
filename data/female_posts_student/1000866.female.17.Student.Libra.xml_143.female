OK, so when Kelly becomes rich and famous, and I go to one of her concerts, and then try to get backstage, the guards will yell at me and be like, "GET AWAY YOU WHITE HAIRED NUTCASE!" And I'll be like, "But I know her!!!" And they'll laugh in my face, and then Kelly will come up and say, "Catie my love," and I'll laugh REALLY HARD into the guards faces. Ahahahahaha. It shall be fun.
