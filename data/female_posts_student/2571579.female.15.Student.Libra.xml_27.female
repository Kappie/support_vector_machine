So last person I went out with was Craig and i still kind of like him. The thing is I know I should just forget about it and move on. So i'm trying i guess. At the park Matt Wisneski comes and visits a lot because his sister goes there and I thought i liked him for a while. I'm not really sure anymore tho. First off he's only gonna be a 9th grader. So I've never even dated anyone my age let alone younger then me. On the other hand he's really funny and I love when he's there. Ok .. then I kind of think I like Al who works at the park with me. See he's 18. I play basketball with him and wow is that fun. Lets just say we get somewhat physical with it haha. We were playing 1 on 1 =) I also play checkers and spit with him.. and i always loose but that's Ok. He's a freshman in college tho so i'm not sure if that's too old or whatnot tho. I also dont know if he just thinks of me as a little girl. Matt knows that i kind of like him now but i dont think they really talk so that might not help. I liked him last year a little too but i didn't really talk to him as much. I guess with two weeks of the park left I better figure it out before it's too late. But I guess that's it for now and I will post again when something changes. --peace; kacie
