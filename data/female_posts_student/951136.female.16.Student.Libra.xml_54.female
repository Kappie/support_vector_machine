The only thing that gets you through each day, and the only thing that keeps you awake through the night.  A mere daydream that can fill your life with all that is good, but without it you'd be able to breath again.  Its steals all rational from your actions and words, gives you its own, and leaves you alone in the reckage.  It is a thought. a whisper from a dream.  Never close enough to reach out and cling to- yet with its simple touch warmes the very essance that makes up your soul.  He is a desire. A shadow in the mask of millions.  Never staying long enough for you to get exactly what you want so the yearning never ceases.  never releases its hold over you.
