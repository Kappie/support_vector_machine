According to the Washington Post some fertility clinics offer shared risk programs which gives patients an opportunity to receive cash back if the vitro-fertilization isnâ€™t successful.  Technically, patients are able to go through three cycles of trying to become pregnant and they are charged an upfront fee of $20,000 which will be refunded if the woman does not become pregnant.  If the woman becomes pregnant they will not be refunded and if a patient would like to try a fourth time if they did not become pregnant after the third time they are charged an additional fee for each cycle.   	 I feel that this is an ethical situation being that the patient gets the right to refuse and accept options and also their wishes are granted, accepted and respected at the same time.  Moreover, the individuals whom go through the process of the shared risk program will be guaranteed their cash if the process does not go as planned which is a positive outcome.    Please feel free to comment I would like to know your opinions.  The Washington Post May 18, 2004. Article: A Baby, or Cash Back. By: Lisa Barrett Mann Retrieved on May 19, 2004.
