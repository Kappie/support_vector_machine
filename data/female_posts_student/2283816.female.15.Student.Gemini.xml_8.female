Hi, ramon! LAAAAAA!!!  You are ... ?  I'm drawing a complete blank here. I could be like Kevin and blow things up, but I'm not in a destructive mood. Yet. *thinks*   I need a bomb.   *runs out to store*  *returns with large, twenty-pound daisy cutter*  Ahh, much better. What shall I destroy?  I could blow up the computer lab! Hah!   Of course, that idea was all mine, not Brandon's. Brandon had no part in that last brilliant idea. The credit is all mine. Mine, mine, mine. I have a broken arm in Jessie's Oregon Trail game.   WOW, I'm bored. Loooo. I'm going to Yahoo o see if I can watch la videos musica. Farewell.
