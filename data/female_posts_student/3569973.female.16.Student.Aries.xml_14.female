I went and got my oil changed, then me and Jake went to my Dads house and had this huge water balloon fight and ended up having to leave at about 3:30 because I had to be at work at 5. Then I ended up getting off work which I really dont need to do because I need the money, but ya know what can ya do...so I got of work at about 7 and Jake decided that I needed to come over right away. Well I met the ENTIRE family and things didnt really get fun until it was dark. Me, Tracy, and Sunny ended up having our own fun then Lynn decided that I needed to go lite fireworks. So I ended up winning everyone over after they saw me lite 3 canons for about 30 minutes. Then they had this stupid war with roman candles. Jake ended up getting real bad hurt and we had to go to the hospital and we didnt get back to his house until about 3 that morning. So yesterday and today Ive been taking care of him. Well I gotta go cause the phone is ringing. Till then, Later Days
