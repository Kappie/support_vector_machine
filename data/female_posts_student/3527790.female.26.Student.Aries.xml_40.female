I went for a little 4km race yesterday in like 28+ degree heat (not counting the smog advisory or the humidity) and I was able to keep a 5 min km pace so I was pretty happy with that. I just want to do well in this race.   I'm no longer going to be camping in my supervisors backyard. It is just going to be WAY to busy at her cottage, so instead I have to find a place to sleep today. I may end up at a hotel now. I'll just have to see, what is available and what is affordable. AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH. I hate last minute changes!   I had my adopted Grandpa over for dinner last night. We had fun. The food that I cooked turned out really well and nothing burned ...with me that is always a risk and we spent an enjoyable evening together. I have really come to care for him. I mean three years ago we barely knew each other and now I honestly do feel as though he is my grandfather! It pretty neat how people can come into your life and make it that much richer just by being a part of it!   Anyways I have to call umpteen hotels to try and find a place to stay Saturday night in Bala.  I'm nervous about this race.
