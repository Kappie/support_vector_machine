I have nothing to complain about.  Hell, I had Subway for dinnner.  I just love that song is all.  Outkast is just the greatest.  I watched the video for Roses all the way through for the first time today, and I thought, wow, this is all I really need in life.  Anyway, I don't know that there is a song that reflects my mood right now.  It would probably be kind of boring. Today is my mother's birthday.  Just glad I remembered.  Oooh, she's about to go to Eckerd's.  I need some more dye, yo.  I'll be back. Ok, here I am.  Could it be that I don't have any homework?  Sure looks that way.  That's pretty hot.  God, this week went by so fast.  I'm excited about the weekend.  I need to get some sleep.  I've been going to bed later than usual.  Should probably stop that. I got an invitation to my cousin's wedding shower yesterday.  That'll be really fun.  And the wedding in July will be an interesting experience.  I haven't been to a wedding in a really long time.  You know what this means: my parents must buy me a new outfit.  Mwhahahaha!  I love it when they have to give me stuff.
