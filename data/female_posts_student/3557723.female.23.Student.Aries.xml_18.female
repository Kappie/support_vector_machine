She needed a home or was going to be put to sleep and we needed another cat to keep Russell company. From the second Esper met Russell, she let him know that she wasn't a kitty to be messed with, and in fact has been the Alpha Cat of the household.   Esper has a wonderful loving personality. She is cat that approaches you when she wants to and on her terms. Unlike Russell who doesn't mind a human picking him up for a cuddle. However, with me alone, Esper does allow me to pick her up for a cuddle and allows me to approach her on my terms. This is especially good when I have had to pick her up in a hurry.   urlLink     urlLink     Esper is approximately 2 years of age though she is the size of a 9 month old kitten. She hasn't grown a great deal from when we picked her up at five months of age. She's the small cat that I've always wanted.   urlLink     urlLink
