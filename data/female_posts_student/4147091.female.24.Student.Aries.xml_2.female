The woman who proclaims to be organized has haphazardly trashed my itinerary. But this is to be expected, she always trashes things without actually stopping to see if important. Oh my...SHE will be getting me a new one, not me.  So our house is being sold. The market is good and I now have 8 days to say goodbye to a house I"ve lived in for 14 years. I will come home at Christmas and have a new home. And whats even more distrubing is that my parents have decieded that since I"m 24, and I will be 26 when I graduate, they no longer need a house, they are going to get an apt. Small, with a pullout for me when i come to visit. I'm being uncerimoniously kicked out of the nest. Sure, I never really had any true plans on moving back after i graduated, but still, to have my parents come to that conclusion and make arrangments that way.....its very scarey.  Yah, so 8 days. I"m slowly beginning to feel lonely. I don't know anyone is Calgary, I"m leaving my friends, I"m starting a new school, a new life and I"m single. Not that the last one really matters, but it would be nice to have someone to share my owes with. As it is, I"m talking constantly to my best friends, chewing their ear off, so to speak and making a sad attempt to unload through MSN with a friend in South Africa. Now, if I had a sig. other, I would simply unload on them and they, being my better half, would have to endure this long and arduous event in order to stay in good boyfriend standing with me. Its the rule.  Random question of the day: At what age is it too old to dye part of your hair bright purple?
