Ahh.. but yes, my head there's so much in there, but if I started telling you about that I'd probably have the men in white coats coming to take me away. Last time they did that, they took the lucozade off me. :( Actually! I have lucozade! Yeay! Sorry, I'm content at the moment, I just read a relaxing manga :) I just care about being relaxed don't I? The one thing that is hardest for me to be! *geez, I am relaxed, I can't word things very well!* Hmm it's interesting to be in this mood, to see where you mind wonders when you're not driven by emotion. Seeing as I'm listening to the weird music that is the start of fushigi yuugi, I'm scared by my brain. Hmm... guess it's a good thing that I don't get to explore it today - I've got things to do. *shock* Hey, don't go all out, I'm just gonna wrap some presents up and go 'HOLY SHIP!' because I'll realise I've got billions of pieces of homework. Isn't life fun?
