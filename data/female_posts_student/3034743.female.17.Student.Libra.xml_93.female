It was a half day, so after school I was bored and called Amanda to ask if I could come over and clean. So I did that for awhile, and then I showed her the "fort" in the field. We met Alex there, because Amanda dropped us off at the middle school so me and alex could walk home with chloe. so we walk chloe home and along the way we show her the "fort". then we ran in the tall grass. haha. it was fun. then alex came back to my house where we made a list and some visuals for my mom to persuade her into letting me have an all night movie night tomorrow. then we played some james bond on nintendo. we felt like boys, but it was fun. so tomorrow night we're gonna try to have some ppl spend the night and watch movies. it should be fun. i'll talk more when more happens. haha.
