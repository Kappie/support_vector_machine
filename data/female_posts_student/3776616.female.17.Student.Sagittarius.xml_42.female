I was just in a fairly bad mood... bored, missing people back home, the Ken stuff...  and then I read Beth's blog and I freaked out and started crying...  All the stuff about the party at Robert's the other night, and the party that's going to be tonight, and all the stuff about Sam and... I don't know...  Part of me just doesn't want to go home.  I want to leave and never come back... I don't know where I'd go, I just want to go, really far away, away from everyone and everything...  And right now I'm really desperate to party...  And I'm missing all the stuff this weekend, and no one is going to be in the mood when I get back... Tues night I can't b/c I get my wisdom teeth pulled on weds so I can't drink past midnight... Then I won't really be in the mood weds night... so the soonest will be Thurs or Fri... I don't know if I can wait that long... and I know I sound like some freak crazed alcoholic or something stupid like that, but frankly I don't care what I sound like.  I'm in a REALLY bad mood, feeling a bit of party withdrawl, which is worsened by all the talk of partying, and I don't know how much longer I can stand this... GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr  sorry... forget everything.  fuck it all
