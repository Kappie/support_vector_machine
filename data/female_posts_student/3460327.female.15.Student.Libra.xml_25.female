Two people who share a bond for reasons neither know,   A feeling that they were friends, a long, long time ago?   Did they stumble onto each other by pure circumstance,   Or was it fate and destiny that played a certain hand?   Two souls intertwined, they are worlds apart,   But the soul, it knows no difference, in matters of the heart.   Somehow they are drawn together, fate has brought them back,   Each living worlds apart, they journey separate paths.   When this life is over, and a new life begins,   Their souls will find each other, two souls that we call friends.   - Lia Fail -   2.   Standing by,   All the way.   Here to help you through your day.   Holding you up,   When you are weak,   Helping you find what it is you seek.   Catching your tears,   When you cry.   Pulling you through when the tide is high.   Absorbing your voice   When you talk.   Standing by when you learn to walk.   Just being there,   Through thick and thin,   All just to say, you are my friend.   - Brittani Kokko -   3.   Friendship is like the breeze,   You can't hold it,   Smell it,   Taste it,   Or know when it's coming,   But you can always feel it,   And you'll always know it's there,   It may come and then go,   But you can know it'll always be back.   - Terri Fanning -   4.   Friends will come and friends will go,   The seasons change and it will show,   I will age and so will you,   But our friendship stays, strong and true   - Anonymous -
