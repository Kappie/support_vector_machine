I'll have to basically re-write my project proposal, but other than that, I'm feeling pretty good about it.    Joe, my Fulbright mentor, happens to be on the UT committee and gave me several very good pointers on improving the project proposal.  He understood my wanting to draw a correlation between observations I had about the Cuban educational system and the possible effect of technology on education in Brazil.  Where one is lacking the other has, and vice versa.  The application still needs alot of work before I send it off to the committee in New York, but at least I have a panel here at UT designed to aid me in the process, in making my application the best that it can be.  I'm pretty sleepy--been up since the crack of dawn.  Nobody should have to be up before the sun has risen.  Nappy time.
