After about a minute of thinking, I came up with one for me: "What's up?" by 4 Non Blondes.   25 years of my life and still   I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope   For a destination   I realized quickly when I knew I should   That the world was made up of this   Brotherhood of man   For whatever that means      So I cry somethimes when I'm lying in bed   To get it all out what's in my head   Then I start feeling a little peculiar   So I wake in the morning and I step   Outside I take deep breath   I get real high   Then I scream from the top of my lungs   What's goin' on      And I say hey...   And I say hey what's goin' on   And I say hey...   I said hey what's goin' on      And I try, oh my God do I try   I try all the time   In this institution   And I pray, oh my God do I pray   I pray every single day   For a revolution      So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in my bed   To get it all out what's in my head   Then I start feeling a little peculiar   So I wake in the morning and I step outside   I take a deep breath   then I get real high   Then I scream from the top of my lungs   What's goin' on      And I say hey...   And I say hey what's goin' on   And I say hey...   I said hey what's goin' on   And I say hey...   And I say hey what's goin' on   And I say hey...   I said hey what's goin' on      25 years of my life and still   I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope   For a destination      (Just ignore the fact that I'm not 25 ... but you kinda get the idea.)   [Thanks to  urlLink http://www.alwaysontherun.net/4non.htm#c  - where I copied the lyrics from. But I think they're a bit wrong. You can find the song and make your own judgements]
