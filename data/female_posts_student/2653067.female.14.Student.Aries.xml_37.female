I've just been so occupied with school and exams and tanning and relaxing and being bored that I haven't really gotten around to writting anything.  There isn't always anything to talk about.  Let's see what we have today...  So today are the elections.  I know I'm not old enough to vote but I do have two things to say:  Harper sucks.. don't vote for him.  Okay now enough of that.  Just talking about politics makes my blood boil.  Gah, I really do hate this.  All I'm going to say is that I hope Paul Martin wins the election.  Hah.  Enough of this blabber.  Today Vanessa and I went downtown.  Vanessa needed more dye and bleach (She's dying her hair blue) so we took the 601 and headed down to the store to buy some more.  I, not really having anything else to do, tagged along.  It was quite fun.  I looked for some suspicious looking people on the way home.  I think I counted about 48.  Hmm.. I have no idea what I'll be doing tonight.  I haven't really done anything with friends since wednesday.  It seems like its been so long.  I'm currently feeling a little tired (it's probably because I'm trying to read this really small print).    I've got  Absolutely Zero  plans for July 1st.  No, I'm not going to see fireworks or get plastard or do anything.  I think I'll just stay home and relax or have a sleepover at someones house (I can't have one here cause mom's working).  I am definately  NOT  looking forwards to the facking "TOUR DE DELTA" thing.  Every year, stupid people gather around ladner village, watch people race around and then they ring these facking loud cowbells.  THE COWBELLS ARE ANNOYING!  The race is  supposed  to end at 9:00 pm but it always  goes on t'ill 10:00 pm and I can't ever get to sleep or concentrate on what I'm doing.  Gah.  I hope it eventually gets canned.  Muhahha.    I'm definately looking forwards to the beginning of July because we're going to start our flooring project.  It'll be so nice :)! Hopefully it'll be all done by mid-august so I can then have a sleepover (or two).  Lol.  Im getting outta here.
