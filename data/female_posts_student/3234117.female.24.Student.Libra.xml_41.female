The depth of color is definitely a lot richer than my normal dark brown hair color.   I guess I'm the odd ball. Normally people go darker in the winter and lighter in the summer. But, you know, who cares really? I think I look like a totally different person and it's a lot of fun! I've finally gone from trashy to classy! I've got the pearl earrings, the bleached white teeth, the trendy clothes (okay well some), and the runner's body (okay well I'm still working on that one). I'm just waiting for my pearl necklace. Mom?  If only I can keep this image up. I guess it meansgoodbye to my old, faded blue Baby-G watch. This is definitely not classy. And I guess it means goodbye to my carlos n charlies shirt I wear every other day. My mom and my sister will breathe a sigh of relief on those two. Maybe she can take me shopping? Or maybe I could just go shopping on her credit card? Doubtful. Or maybe I'm just full of crap. It's hard to be classy....it takes a lot of work. At least I have classy hair. That'll do for now. I'll just raid my friend Amy's closet. She always dresses classy. Where do you think I get my sense of style from?!
