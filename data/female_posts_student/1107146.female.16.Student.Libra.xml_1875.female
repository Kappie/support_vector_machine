What subjective stuff does the PSAT have that the SAT doesn't?  And welcome back to the boards, Will.  Abby and I were just talking about your "being dead" again.  I wish the Marlins would win, but I doubt they will.  I really wanted the Cubbies in it, though.  It broke my heart when they lost.  I was on the phone with Michael when it happened (almost in tears, btw) and he was like "Hey, it's just baseball.  Don't cry.  No, I'm serious.  Don't cry.  I'm really bad with that.  Please don't cry.  Please?!?"  So I waited till I got off the phone ;)  Ok, so I didn't cry, but I came close.  I was very disappointed to say the least.  My mom actually did cry.  My dad may have too, but he's in Chicago, so I can't tell for sure.  But his voice broke when we were talking about it, a sure sign that he was indeed crying.    But, now that they're out, I'd rather a semi-southern team beat a Yankee team- wow, who would've thought they would have been so creative with naming the team?  And again, Abby, whoa.  I can't believe it's Samantha.  We were so right!!!
