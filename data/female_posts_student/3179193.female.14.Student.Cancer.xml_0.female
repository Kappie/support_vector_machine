Since I went outside, my mom wouldn't let me on the computer. -___-" Gayness. But I snuck online and read his blog since he blogged. Tsk tsk tsk... he only blogs when something big happens or whatever. Well, I guess everything's okay. He called yesterday and we talked for a while. Again, he only seems to call when something happens... -____-" Like when he called to clearify the whole Shar thing and also when he asked me out... and now to ask about what was wrong. Blahness... -__-" Oh well... I guess things are okay now and stuff. I miss him... >O  Today was Hoops4Heart. We had a 3 on 3 tournament. My team won. [Yay! We won last year too!] and Nima's team didn't win... but he did really well. I was watching when I wasn't playing... and sometimes when I  was  playing. Hee hee~ *achoozZ* My deo is making me sneeze... baby powder scent... haha...! Nothing too flowery. Blahness... =/   Hmm, Erica told me about some Marcos dude. He sounds really funny. Godfrey asked me if I knew Marcos today on MSN. I THINK I know Marcos. They say his name is Marcos Ho. I dunno... I really wanna meet him though. So I'll be going to Sunday Worship whether I get a ride or not! 'Cos I really wanna meet this Marcos Ho dude! I knew a Marcos Ho from kindergarten! Hee hee! It'd be cool if I really do know him from before though! MuahahahazZ~! Anyways... Gotta go... If you're reading this, Nima... I love you ;)
