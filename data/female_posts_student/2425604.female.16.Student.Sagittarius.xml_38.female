Watching you watching the ones that I wanted to be. Blaming this all on a moment, blaming this all on my views, blaming the mood of the music, blaming it all on you. All on you and me. All on you and me.  Just because you said what you wanted doesn't make it right.  Just because the moment was heated doesn't mean that I wanted to fight, and even though I saw your anger, even though I saw your face, the words that you cited were chosen, not thinked, not spoken in haste. All on you and me. All on you and me.   Just for the moment, just one more time, just one more second and we'll be just fine, this could be just, be just in case it's the last time. Just for the moment, Just one more time, Just one more second and we'll be just fine, This could be the last time...  Just until sundown, just one more day I could hold you, that I could hold you, Just until sundown, just one more day I could hold you, without you, pushing me away. All on you, And me.  yea i have highlgighted the points to show you what is the direct point of that quote like itd would cool if you read the whole thing but im not gonna push you into it ... and sorry if you all take it the wrong way but thats how i feel damnit and if you dont like it than shove it up your butt ok mi out then bye
