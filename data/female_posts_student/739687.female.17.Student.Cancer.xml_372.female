I'm not sure if I should talk about it, but for some reason, although it would typically upset most people, and for a few others make them overjoyed :-\...it set me free somewhat. Free from the constraints that have been placed upon me. I'm free because I've got something to fight with. Everything can't be my fault anymore. I don't have to sit back and watch my heart wear and dissipate. NO MORE. I'm not sure whether I'm happy about it or not, needless to say it doesn't so much upset me.  It's interesting.  So things will get better. They've already begun to, infact.  Here's a tip for all of you fools out there: If you can shrink down the credibility of your oppressive authority, you can weaken their power to enforce such authority.  It's like that whole 'lead by example' thing. If your leaders make some seriously little follies, then hey, can't you do the same? If they express that you should do as they have done, then do so.  But never, ever expose the truth until you have to. You have to undermine authority until they can catch YOU and expose YOU. Then you may expose them.  Because, why would you want to throw something out on the floor that you could save for when you really really need it?   Life is a card game. It does, I admit, have alot to do with the cards you are dealt. But it has much, much more to do with strategy.   Play smart, crazies.
