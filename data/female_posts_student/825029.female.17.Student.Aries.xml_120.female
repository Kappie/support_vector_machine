I really am going to try to update this more frequently...  anyhoo, the weekend is almost over and yet another week of school is fast approaching : (   I think I’m getting sicker, and I feel really poopy.  But I’ll survive!    Well, yesterday was area, so congratulations to all those that made state!  And congratulations to all those who didn’t make state, because you guys are still awesome!  Steph Hsu-- a special congratulations to you and I’m sorry you have to deal with that horrible, horrible man.  And Charles, well we all know Charles should’ve made it... just give Habibi the names of the judges and he’ll take care of everything!    As I’m writing this, it’s snowing outside!  Too bad it’s not gonna stick : \   I want to live up north when I’m older, for the sole reason that it snows during the winter... I’ve always wanted to build a snowman, as stupid as that may sound.. hehe those dorky ones that me and Shelly made in elementary school don’t count.    I don’t really have much else to say- as usual, life is pretty boring.  Only 2 days until a very special someone turns 17!    Cool song alert! Disturbed - Shout 2000    Adios guys!
