I called the Dr finally this morning around 10ish and they said to wash his head off and just use the cortizone. Today, Nick  I hung out at the mom's~G'ma Lu. I got a chance to lay out in the sun  burn while Nick played and slept. Overall, relaxing afternoon especially compared to yesterday, last night and this morning! Nick did not sleep while. Shawn got home around 11pm and we stayed up until midnight and Nick was up by 3. Ick! I could not get him to fall back asleep so finally, I told Nick he had one more chance to be good in mommy's bed before he is sent to his crib...Alone! He used up that chance so I brought him to his crib and climbed into bed and 30 seconds later...HE'S PLAYING! And it's 4 am...Sleep time! Ahhhhhhhhh. Yesterday when I was trying to get him to nap, he grabbed my face so hard. I told Nick, No! And do you know what my naughty boy did...He smiled and laughed! I laughed, too! I can't resist a sweet face like his =)
