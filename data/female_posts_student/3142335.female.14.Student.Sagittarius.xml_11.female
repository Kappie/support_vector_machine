I spent the night with Brit on Friday night and we babysat and then went with Shane and Keegan and stayed with them for a little while and had ablast and then woke up on Saturday at like 12 or so and I came home and then went back over to Brit's at like 9:30 at night crying my eyes out and told her like her everything on my mind...just lately I've had SO freakin much stuff on my mind. I dont know it's just been crazy...one of my best friends told me to never talk to him again and then just guy stuff being so confused and so just ya know the usual stuff it's oh so wonderful but yeah anyways I gotta go now I'll write back again later on love you! bye
