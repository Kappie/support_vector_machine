YEAAAYYY! (And who cares if I get followed by rats all the way home!?) Umm... but people might notice the flies... HEEEY! How about a bine liner dress! Ahh... people just don't bother to follow fashion do they? Or... a superman outfit! *new and improved* i.e. cut up scab clothes. Seriously, I don't care! Everyone's getting worked up, well, know what? Mine's gonna be free apart from the top cause I'm recycling stuff! Muhahaaaa... the ultimate freak strikes again!
