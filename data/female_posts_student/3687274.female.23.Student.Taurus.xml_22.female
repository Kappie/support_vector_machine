Only because someone took out my food twice and left it sitting open on the counter. Oooh was I pissed. Then, I didn't want to be here anymore. Then my coworker called me at 10 til 7 to ask me when I'd be back, after I had call him to let him know that I would be back at 7. If this was the first time that had happened I would have been, like, whatever. But it happens a lot. And it gets more and more annoying every single time. So I told him over the radio, in a really mean tone, it's not 7 yet. I'm on my way. Grrr. That was it. Nothing big. Nothing small. Nothing. Nothing is also better than something when something is asshole coworkers.  And asshole friends who steal back there game system like a thief in the night. You thought I hadforgotten, huh? Nope. Never. But now I have my snes and I don'tneeeeed your stupid little controller with awhole bunch of wires and a gun and another controller and I think that's all.So, fart on your grave!!! Asshole tracybaconfat thief.  It is almost time for me to go home. I'm so very happy. Sometimes when I say SC Johnson, it sounds like assy johnson...I thought it was funny.
