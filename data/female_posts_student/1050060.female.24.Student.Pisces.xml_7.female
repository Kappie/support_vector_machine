So she came and picked me up at 9:00pm. I had to sleep at her house last night which was fine by me. I had the best night sleep in a long time even when the baby woke me up around 5 this morning. I guess it is because it was so quiet. I live down on king street so no matter what time it is there is always noise. So i guess that is what has been keeping me up and why i am not sleeping well. Anyways other then that things went well and i didn't realize until today that i miss being around the little kids. So it was a real nice change. I still like working with the youth more. Anyways have a good day i know i will.
