I've got to start plucking my eyebrows. they are growing like never before and its absolutely gross. problem is i hate plucking. I bought this waxing kit but its not taking any hair off. what a waste of $8.70. anyway it istime to go. I am going to make some kimchi on saturday. well actually i might end of buying it from the grocery store, but anyway.
