I went to church and well the feeling afterwards I love.  I think a good ole conversation with God was just what I needed.  And well when I got home from church I practiced my math for a while then had an apple (yummmm, I think I am addicted to fruit) [Scary thought when I realize fruit is actually healthy] and well yeah now I am back on my comp cause everyone works sundays and like there is never time to do anything.  I'm like sunlight deprived or something and well yeah walking hope from church it was nice with the sun rays just bouncing off my face.  Kinda weird actually the sun put me in a better mood.   The chem teacher told us we might have a quiz monday (even though we just have one of Friday) so yeah I hope she decides not to have it.  Cause well lets see all the things I have crammed into my head: Chem, Math, Social, What I am making for dinner, how good my book was, friends, influences, Tv shows, lets see TOO MUCH!!!!  GRRRR and I just got one of those sales call things: this is sears blah blah blah survery.  Like K I don't want to hear that!! - It should be like a law that only people that know you or are your friends can call!  And yeah when I was practicing my math I realized that uhh I think I understand most of the stuff in this unit!!!  For once I understand alot of something that was really hard to learn, oh how proud of myself I am right now.  Now I just have to get that mark I need on the unit test thurs and boost my math mark.  I have a 70 right now but the way I work and effort I put in I feel it should at least be an 80 so yeah I'm gonna try get that 80 I deserve.  As for chem, well all I can really do is study like usually and practice, practice, practice those calculation problem things still my head hurts and til I WILL get them right 100% of the time.  I think I CAN do good on this unit, but it's REALLY HARD to understand and yeah alot of times it is very frustrating and I honestly HATE crying over dumb stuff like that all the time.  But well I NEED chem for university so I am just gonna have to suck it up, get through the year, and I try to understand and do my best.  And well I am planning to get Chem over and done with doing summer school when it rolls around again.  If I do chem 30 during the summer that means no Chem during the regular school year [yeah I sure would like the idea of that wouldn't I]  I think the next Joe Millionaire starts tommorow.  Oh how excited I am - makes me want to jump up and down.  Of course if I was a kid that would be ok, but yeah I am think people would start to stare at like an older perosn.  And well I want it to be like almost Halloween.  I CAN'T wait for Megans party!!!!  Like seriously we are gonna have a big sleepover with lotsa people and I CAN'T wait!!!  Megz is like one of my close friends now(I would call her one of my best friends right now cause chels well hasn't been my "ideal" of a best friend lately) and Megz and I met in Drama last year.  In gr. 9 we both got medals for Drama even though we went to diff. schools.  That is like wicked.  And we all best pals in Drama Queenism forever!!! Lol [she wrote that in my yearbook]  And well mentioning yearbooks I have like closed eye syndrome in like almost all the photos I am in.  The only pics with my eyes open are my portrait one and the ones on the band page.  You know I really hated the thoery in band last year, and well the teacher for band last year doesn't score alot of points in my book, but I kinda miss playing my flute.  Megz wants me to join choir next year and chels always told me too take it.  I can sing and all and people that do hear me like drop cause they love my voice apparently but I dunno I think I will consider it.  I mean besides it would be someing FUN next year [A fun class besides Drama - now we're talkin'] and yeah I think it would be kind of fun.  I am not sure if I wanna do the band thing again cause it's more theory than choir and with my load I think I will need less.  I can't even believe I am in gr. 11 now.  I am like getting old, and I will like serious cry for the longest amount of time when high school is over cause man even though life can be a bitch sometimes and all the times I go through.  School is like my second home.  I love school and ya know what I don't care bout anyone who thinks differently.  Lots of people call me crazy for thinking that but ya know what I got goals, hopes, dreams.  One day I will be at the front of a class and I will be teacher.  Yes, I will cause that is my passion.  The one true thing I have wanted to do since grade 7.  I could not imagine doing anything else, that would be like a sin.  Yeah and I think I am gonna get off my comp now cause it's cold downstairs where my comp is and NO light - I need light, thrive on light now.  I feel really good right now.  Chelsey went away this weekend - no friday with chels.  It felt kinda good though.  Instead of competing with someone else I could be me, people focused on me, talking to me, concerned for me, I am not self centered or anything but it gets annoying when CHELSEY always comes before I even will.  That honestly does both me.  But what the hell I don't need to be worrying about things like that.  If I always worried about things like that then I'd think I would go crazy!!!  [yeah vanessa as if you are not crazy now?]  Well yeah this term in school is really stressful and I do want high school to last but I *CAN'T* wait for next term...ya know what that means...DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA.  I am born to be on stage [now that I think about it teaching a class would be like the same thing] which is a neat realization.  I am a Leo (ROAR - lol)  Ok so that is like the reason I was born in August or something.  Now that I think of it getting into a Drama was not really even my choice, it was an accident, or well it makes more sense to call it "fait" or "destiny."  I still remember at the end of gr. 8 we had to choose options and well I choose the one's I wanted and well never thought about it.  The next year in gr. 9 I got my schdule and was like all pissed off cause I didn't get like any of the options I wanted.  I made me soooo furious and Drama was on my schedule.  At first I didn't really like it, in fact day to day I claimed "I hate this, I hate that" but by the end of the yeah on of my fav. things we had to do was our monologues.  I blew everyone away - literally.  I went first and after that everyone was scared to go up cause no one wanted to follow after me.  After that I don't think I ever recieved so many compliments in my life.  Then I came to a realization and thought "You know what I spent all this time saying I hated Drama, well ya know what I really LOVE drama, it's great."  So then the end of the year rolled around and they were givin out medals for "Top marks" and I got the "Top Drama" one.  It was cool, it still hands with all my medals from soccer in my room [soccer medals is a whole other story - got 14 medals for that] but yeah the Drama medal has my name carved on the back with the year and my grade at the time which was gr. 9.  I thought it was like the best thing even cause even though I have earned like a million soccer medals they don't engrave your name on the back.  And well so then I took Drama in gr 10 and LOVED it so now I am gonna do it till the 30 level and cause of "fait" I met Megz and like expanded my range of friends.  And well my hand hurts now from typing but I didn't realize I had alot of stuff to think about of vent about or get of my chest.  But it feels better.  Things feel better.  I feel better.  Chels better now ruin this mood tommorow - I won't let her.  She always ruins my happiness to make herself happy but not tommorrow.  Not this time.  I am gonna be me, happy me, old me, confident me, the girl I used to know.
