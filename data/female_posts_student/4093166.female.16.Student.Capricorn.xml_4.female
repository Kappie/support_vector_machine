I just go crazy every now and then and end up experimenting.  That is it.  Nothing big, don't think that....  I just reread my blog and figured I would clear that up a little...  I do believe the guy I have a crush on knows about my feelings now.  I think I ruined a lot by letting him know, but he insisted.  Anyway, Band camp starts Monday.  WOO HOO!!!  I have to march around in the hot sun for 10 hours everyday for two weeks.  Then school starts.  But at least I'll lose weight and get a tan before school starts back.  Well, I hope someone posts for me... Don't be too bored....,    Jami
