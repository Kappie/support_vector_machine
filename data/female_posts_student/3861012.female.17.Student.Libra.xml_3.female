I went for a nice drive to Moss Vale and Wollongong, it was very pretty and there was good company too :). The weather could have been better but you can't win them all.   I have tonight off work so I might continue my nice bludge that I have going.   I have a HEAP of yearbook stuff to do... There are profiles that need to be typed up, it's so tedious but I really want to get it done by REALLY early next term so there is no stress.
