I am happy today for once.  I feel like I all of a sudden got some confidence back in me today and I really believe that I can do things right now.  Matt and I are going to the dance tommorow.  He is meeting me there though cause he has to go write some important test at Cadet's tommorow but then he is missing the rest to go to the dance.  I can't wait!  I still have to think of something to get him for Christmas but I have no clue what guys like.
