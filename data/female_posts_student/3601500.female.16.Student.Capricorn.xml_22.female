The kittens she cared for have been taken to Ottawa yesterday, without my cousin's permission (they have been caring for them ever since they were found, and they both really wanted one. He was very mad, while my sister was very sad...) I told him I would go over to his house, but I didn't even call. I feel horrible - I got to bed at 5:30 this morning, was awoken around 12:00; I told him I'd be there at 9 o'clock. I figured, might as well just call him tomorrow, when he's calmed down... :/  I finally met my neighbours. The girl is very nice and easy to talk to - she's the kind of person who makes you comfortable in her presence. I tried to be friendly (and hope I achieved to be) - we went over to her house, and played cards (cheat - I think it's also called bullshit?) with our siblings (her brother and sister, my little sister). Only Evil (my fourteen years old sister) has yet to meet them. The boy (who's 15) should definetely cut his hair, is friendly and somewhat funny, asked lots of questions. He's going in grade 11, but that's because he skipped his fifth grade. I think we could be good friends.  Now, I should eat. I've only eaten a bowl of oatmeal this afternoon. :P
