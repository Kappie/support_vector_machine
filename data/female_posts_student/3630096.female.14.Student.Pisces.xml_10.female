It belongs to my big brother whom I always respect, whom I always seek whenever I had trouble with homework, whom is my greatest childhood playmate, whomalways accompany me.    I had never expect him to do this thing of sort. It was nothing.It was a bit childish to me but it's too much! Imagine! Waking up, walking up to the dinner table expect tosee a platefull of fried chicken. Withintwo hours, so many things happened. I dunno why but he consumed them all except for2 pathetic pieces left at a plate.   I broke into tears. I couldn't resist it. He was so- so...sigh. It was a bit childish, yes. No, it was so childish. But I couldn't help it. Your stomach empty, you expect your mum to whipped up something delicious specially for your family,  AND YOUR BROTHER ATE IT ALL!  Too much, don't you agree?    I insisted that I'd rather skip dinner. I just can't think while eating how your brother had eaten them all without caring about you for a bit! Then I came up with a solution, it happened everywhere. It could also happened in home. That is that my existance was gone in his eyes...    It was a terrible truth to accept but it was my only suspect...
