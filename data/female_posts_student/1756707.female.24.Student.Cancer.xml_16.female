Mince the cilantro and add.  Toss all of this with a good vinaigrette dressing - I used a lime basil vinaigrette - and let sit for half an hour approx to allow the flavors to mellow.  I used about a half cup of dressing - use more or less to your liking.  This salad was spontaneous and amazing, and would probably be good with some fresh diced tomato as well.
