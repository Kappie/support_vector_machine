In all fairness to me: I have slept for about 8 hours collectively out of the last 72 hours so thats why I'm looking a lil ragged in the face.  Other than that enjoy.  Then there is me in my spiffy new roxy hat (which isn't as new as the red hair)  **edit: I'm a genius b.c you can't even see how hardcore my hat is, but whateva!**
