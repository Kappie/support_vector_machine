Here's the synopsis: A native America named Thunder returns home only to find that his ancestral cemetary is being destroyed by construction workers. He trys to put a stop to it, but the law is not only not on his side, but he is banished from town, beaten up, and left for dead. Now he wants his revenge...  The TAGBOARD actually has several purposes.. First, if you're feeling lazy and don't feel like logging into Blogger but would like to share your thoughts, you can just tag the board. Second, if you're not a member of Golden Sushi, you can still post messages on the tagboard!  Third, it works like a guestbook!    I'm really craving a digital camera that can go underwater with me!
