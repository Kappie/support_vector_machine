I got some pics taken with my french horn and stuff but my favorites were the outside pictures. There were horses in the field next to the place and the guy(Bill Miller) said that they were ornery and most people didn't get to take pictures with them, but guess what... I did! aha Miller was like now feed her, but don't feed her, and look at the camera, now don't let her get the grass yet, but look at the camera! I was like ook you're trying to get my finger bit off! Anyhow Micheal Hill came in right after I did and then Lee did his.. but I think overall they are going to be some good pictures(expecially the ones outside!!). So now I'm tired and I'm gunna take a nap!!
