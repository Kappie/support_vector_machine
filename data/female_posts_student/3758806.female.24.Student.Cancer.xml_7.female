What, does he think I'm going to cheat?  I graduated with honors and never cheated on a single test or assignment in my entire academic history (or personal, for that matter), which, believe me, was discouraging while the rest of the "honors" students were writing on their bellies and arms and ankles.  Anyhow, Mr. Senior Editor said the job offer was only on the table for me if I passed the editing test with 100%.  Of course, I occasionally think I'm much smarter than I actually am so I raced through the test (ok, I'm also at the cottage and wanted to go meet my father for a boat ride- who knows when I'll be able to escape the city again?)...  I completed the test, and he already replied with my results.  I didn't get 100%... Would anyone like to know why?  Probably not, but I'm going to tell you anyway!  Mr. Senior Editor (isn't it annoying that I keep writing that?) decided to deny me the job based on  two   very debatable   comma splices .  Grrr...   Grrr, I say.  Oh, there was another mistake too.  Apparently, in the States they spell it "pajamas" instead of the traditional European/Canadian "pyjamas"... I corrected it thinking it was a spelling error.  Crap... should have just checked www.dictionary.com ....  Pajamas.... Pajamas.  It looks funny to me!  So, finally, I guess I won't be assistant to Senior Editor at this "young, young age"  (yeah, he actually said that.... that's blatant age-ism!).  Off to the bonfire and midnight swim, I go!  Wheee!   :)  God, I missed the country.  I'm planning to be in NYC and other huge metro areas in the States this summer.... I'll have to make sure I make a few pit stops here or at the house in Gaspe (right on the ocean!) in between to decompress  :)
