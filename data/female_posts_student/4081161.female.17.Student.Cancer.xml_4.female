No sugar and no caffiene makes Jack a dull girl named Cristie who sits at the computer all night, trying to squeeze out interesting anecdotes from a mundane life. I think I'll just ramble on and on about nothing-in-particular until something interesting spills out.       Got my bag. I scoured Arden mall for my bag. All the stops: American Eagle Outfitter, Abercrombie  Fitch, Other Stores, and Wilson's Leather Place. I don't even remember. Many stores I went to, vast lands I have traveled, many foreigners I have encountered. Be proud of me, I didn't insult anyone directly. I did find my bag though. A forty-nine ninety-nine leather messenger bag I got at the Wilson Leather Store. I hate cows. They need to die. (I'm kidding.) I got a free water bottle too. That was awesome.       I also got to be on the Channel 3 news. You know how there's the KCRA experience and Walt Gray gives you the news at Arden Mall? I was there. I got to be directly in back of Walt Gray behind the glass thingee and I WAS ON TV. Unfortunately, when the camera shot at me, I was trying to blow spit at my four-year-old cousin. Not an attractive start to a Hollywood career.       I don't like the mall, otherwise known as the Breeding Ground to Conformity. I don't like the stores and I don't like the people in it. I also don't like the fact I never have enough money when I go to the mall. That certainly hinders many things. Like purchasing for example.       = Cristie
