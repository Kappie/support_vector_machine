I still need a job but I just recently got my refund check from the Quebec trip ($115 baby!) that was a biiig help.  I need a new cell phone cuz my battery doesn't even last a couple frikin hours ne more.  A new battery would cost $50 so we thought it would be less expensive to just get a new phone. I went to Radio Shack to check out new cell phones but it turns out Sprint is a butt monkey and has all these hidden charges for existing customers.  For a new customer the phone I liked would be something like $59 but since I already have Sprint it's like $199 or some crazy price like that!  I was wicked mad.  They have the best phones around but they're stupid and they only allow you to send pics and stuff through them so you can't put pics on the comp or ne thing.  They're greedy little butts...oh well...
