GAH! *shakes laptop computer visciously* .... *looks around to make sure no one was filming* CPU ABUSE!!!!  Once I do a google search, I click on an option that was found and then IT won't open!!!  I feel the need to send BunBun after Microsoft. Pete can you arrange that? (Note: see online comic Sluggy Freelance if you want to understand that reference.) Does Microsoft have a holiday? CAN WE INVENT ONE?????  Its bad enough that I am cleaning and doing laundry today, but now my CPU has to putz out on me too.  Today isnt going to be a good day.  --Mack
