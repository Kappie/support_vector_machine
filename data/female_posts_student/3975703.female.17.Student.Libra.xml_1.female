I am tired of having to walk on eggshells all the time. I am tired of feeling like everyone is against me. I am just SO tired. I don't know exactly what triggered this feeling, but as of now, I feel like I should just give up on everything. (No, that is not a suicidal thing, don't worry) Lately, I have felt like I have done so much to make everything peaceful and easy rolling, but it seems like the more I try to do that, the more bad comes out of it. I leave my house for one night, and my mom completely flips out on me because my friend forgot to give me a message. I go to practice and I feel like I am not good enough, even though I put in 110%. I feel like I have to watch every move I make or I will destroy something in my life. I just wish that I could feel .. I don't know.. relaxed and easy going. Sara and I were talking about this last night. We were talking about how she is much more personable than I am, but it is only because I keep my guard up until I get to know someone because I have been hurt so many times. I have gotten alot better, but sometimes I just feel like I should stand back and see if anyone comes and talks to me. I don't want to try anymore than what I have to because I feel that when I do, I get stepped on. I am really afraid for the play to end, because with that, some of my confidence might go. I feel so much better about myself since the play started. Most of the cast makes me feel like I am something. My clique (Sara, Johnny, Cody, Sam) always make me feel like I am the greatest person ever. The group of people I just met (Madison, Joel, Laura, Jenessa, Daniel, etc) make me feel like I am so much fun to be around. People who I never thought I could talk to, even if I had to have made me feel like I belong. I don't know, maybe I just have a complex. I know I will have people after the play is over, like Josh, Sara, Cody, and Johnny, but all of these new and interesting people that I have met wont be there. I just need to live it up while I still can. I need to enjoy this last week with everyone. I need to enjoy this last month with my friends who are leaving me, and even the ones I will still see. I guess I just know the inevitable is coming, and I am just scared. I NEED TO BE HAPPY! I will be fine. I am just having a down day. Thank you to everyone though who has been there for me. I don't think I say thank you enough. You do so much for me. Big things like being my confidante to small things like smiling at me to let me know that everything is cool. THANKS                Ok, no more depressing stuff. I feel better now that I vented. I am pretty excited for Thursday. We are having a cast party. I always have so much fun at those. Tonight should be fun too. Josh and I are going out and doing something. I am not exactly sure what yet, but it will be fun. It always is. :) But anyway, I am going to go. I have to cheer up!                        IEEEEEEEEEE! (lol)
