Anyway, I decided to stay at home because I can't stand those crowd and noise level... I will go crazy and dizzy and pukey if I stay for too long. Sianz! I am really feeling weird now... Disappointed actually.. I called Shamus wanting to know how he's doing but he doesn’t give a fucking shit about me at all. Well, since I was not treated nicely so don't expect me to treat you good... I don't give a shit how you are doing now! Blame it on yourself pig! YEAH!    Speaking of Shamus... I was so shocked to see this pub in Tanjong Pagar by the name of Shamus ???? Can't recall the full name liao but it's pretty eye catching... What a spoiler... I was happily going to this place call MOX with WendyX2 and Suelyn. Scott and Angel were supposed to meet us later as she went back home to change some fucking shoes.... Anyway, MOX YOU SUCK BIG TIME U FUCKING BITCH! What a fuckX10 up place! No smoking inside the pub?? Screw all your mums and dads big time! And worst of all.... WE PAID FUCKING 4 BUCKS EACH TO GET OUR BIG FAT ASSES IN! SCREW YOU!    Haiz... Sis was very shocked that we are actually taking her to a Lesbians' place... KAKKAKAKAKAK! She was so reluctant to even go in but was convinced by some guys who got out from the lift and went into MOX. Guess what, those were the people working there!!!! KAKKAKAKAKAKAKAKKA! We left the place soon as we got in. I think just less than 10 mins. Sis was fascinated by the décor but too bad, too much of a cons for us to stay. Well, we proceed to the next destination that is on the second level. Weird place that changes concept like every few week. To my surprise that night we went, the theme is CLOUD. That theme got me all excited because CLOUD is my darling. I am rain and he is cloud. KAKKAKAKAK!    Ant is the name of the place I was talking about. The place is very big and empty. There are a lot of white balloons and also big white tents that looks like a cloud because of a blower blowing the tents up. We ordered drinks and waited for Angel and Scott and come. Stayed there for approximately 2 and half hours. It was a boring place overall… Suelyn wanted so much to see her lover at Cha Xuan and so we decided to sing for the rest of the night! We moved outta Ant and walked along the road, making our ways to Cha Xuan. Scott and I were chatting a lot as we walked on. I think he is quite a nice person lah. Anyway, so long as my sis is happy can liao. I don’t really care… She changes boyfriend like changing g-strings!    When we reached Cha Xuan it was 12.45 already and we had the room till 3am. They ordered a bottle of vodka and we had some vodka lime and screwdriver…. I don’t have to pay because it was my post birthday celebration! Sweet! I seriously hope that it was Gin instead of vodka…. SAD! I did not sing much as they were too noisy and I don’t like singing when people get too noisy. I went outta the room and speak with my darling on the phone instead… When the time strike 3 and I was the most eager to leave… SIANZ! Sis was too tired as she did not sleep well the previous night and as for Wendy, she was a little too high but not drunk. Suelyn went supper with those people working there.    We got on the cab and decided to head home. On the way back, Wendy wanted to puke and asked me to pass her a plastic bag… She then winded down the window and started puking. The car was moving in a very fast speed and she is sitting right in front of me! I couldn’t help but to imagine her missing the bag and the strong wind blew all the puke on my face! I was telling her I felt threatened as I really don’t wanna suffer a second time the same old shit… She puked on me years back when we were still some stupid teenagers! Sis laughed at my remarks and went back to sleep soon after. Great!    Home finally and called darling to tell him I am safe. He was so tired but still insisted of speaking with me… I knew he misses me a lot and so did I. I was very lost and tired because so many things happened. Well… all I can say is, what’s gone is gone… Things will never be the same again and I would want to love him like the way I do 6 years ago. Now, I only have eyes for my skinny, ugly piggy darling of mine! Hee!!    So that’s all for today folks! I am going to watch channel 8 now and later got Steven Chow’s Tang Bo Hu Dian Qiu Xiang.   Kisskiss!
