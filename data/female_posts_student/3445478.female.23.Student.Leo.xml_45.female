I have never been to an actual real professional game before, so I was really excited  for  Shawn. Nick is being an angel today-right now he's sleeping. This morning, Miranda  I met at Brighten Beach and went walking together. I am going to take Nick to the boardwalk later today, too.- If  we get bored. We still have to go to the bank later on and I haven't even showered yet. I have been busy doing laundry, dishes and taking KeKe to soccer practice. Last night went great. I didn't get scared which is impressive for me! Nick was up a lot though. I am just finishing an amazing book called,  Tuesdays with Morrie . It made me take a look at my life and what is really important. It is a true story, too! I better check on Nick...
