I had a pretty good day at school, and than after school I had piano lessons which where a bitch because I have a recital coming up which I hope that you all can come to. I'm really nervous because my grandparents from Arizona are going to see it, they're coming the 8th. After that we picked  up Michelle.. Hayes and she came home with us. We had chinese food at my house... yum and than "studied for a french test" meaning listened to music and chilled out and watched a movie. She left a few minuets ago.. so now I'm here. I'm bored as frig... damn her for leaving... lol.. love ya Michelle... lol. Well, there is not much else to say, and I have to take a shower and chill cuz tonight I'm gonna watch a special episode of  Real World San Diego  because I believe that Frankie is leaving... (thank God), and I want to see the results. So, talk to you all later.
