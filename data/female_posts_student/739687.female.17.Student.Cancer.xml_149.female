You see, lately, I've been finding dissatisfaction in my Catholic religion and upbringing. So I decided not to get confirmed this year, and kind of sort things out. Maybe even find a new religion. Well, I finally realized that basically...I'm anti-organized religion. Yes, I'm a christian and such, I believe in God and that Jesus died for our sins, but I also believe that organized religion is corrupt. Basically, I first weighed the pros and cons of organized religion. My findings:   Pros:  *it enforces common morality into society *in reference to Christianity specifically, it gives different interpretations of the bible, and gathers crowds with similar views   Cons:  *it creates corruption within the church and even the religion itself (By the way, "organized religion" and "church" are two very different things;  urlLink read here ) *it spoon-feeds religion to people, sometimes to the extent of practically "brainwashing" them *it creates biases, and makes people judgemental and close-minded *in reference to the 2nd "Pro" statement, different interpretations to the bible could be a "Con" as well, because people are given interpretations of someone else's opinions  Now, let me clarify that christianity is not an organized religion. the practice of true christianity is called New Covenant Christianity, and it's not an organized religion.
