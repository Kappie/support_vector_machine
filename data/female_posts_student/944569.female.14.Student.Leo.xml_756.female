I hate when Disney changes fairy tales to suit children's wants (example:  Little Mermaid is supposed to die at the end of the story.   Witch does not die.  She does not marry the prince.  She does not wear seashells.  The witch does not try to marry the prince and steal the little mermaid's voice.  Also, Hades is not evil.  He is the God of Death but he is definitely not supposed to be evil.  He pitied Persephone's mother.  Also, he's  not blue with a firy head of hair.)  Quote Derek: "  The Disney-hating sister i knew is gone.  GONE, says I.  She's dead to me now!  Waaaaaah....!  How could you want to see finding Nemo?  Anything made by Disney sux!   I cant believe your friends watch Finding Nemo!!!  What kind of species ARE you?"
