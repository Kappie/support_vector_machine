He is totally removed from Valdosta, so he’s a great confidant. In conversation with  Martyne  this past weekend, I said “I’m a touch chickie”, to which she agreed, “Yes you are”.    So, why do we tear each other apart? I think it boils down to a few simple things.     1) FEAR  – When we fear something, we get defensive. Why would anyone fear me? I think that it is because I’m a very strong person, I know a lot about them, and I’m smart. I don’t always act smart in public, I actually put myself down a lot, but if you doubt it, ask me a question on Middle Eastern Politics or policy… ask me a question on music theory, ask me a question on communication, ask me a question on US Gov’t., the list goes on, the fact is I’m very diverse, which I commented a few entries ago and I think it bothers other individuals. People can fear for stupid reasons….    2) LACK OF KNOWLEDGE  – When we don’t understand something, we also get defensive, we put up a shield to protect ourselves, or we just ignore it. Sorta ties into #1. Also, goes for personal background. For example, there are people out there (you know who you are and if you are reading this, good, maybe you’ll grow up!) who do not understand me. They do not understand why I am the way I am… Yes I am a Christian, and I do drink. Yes, I am conservative, but a thing like dying my hair red doesn’t phase me at all (reference to the formal). Yes, I am a student, however, I am close to several faculty – and you know what? I think that gives me an edge. Yes, I have done some crazzzy things, such as party till dawn and then some, I say have said some crazy things, I have taken some crazy trips, however, I have never compromised the well-being of another person (except for Wes, but that’s another story :-D). All of these things cause cognitive dissonance for individuals, and when a person experiences this, they want balance, so they seek it. Sometimes, this leads tearing another person down.     3) Power  – When someone in power feels that someone else can take over that power, of course it is going to lead to “conflict”. This is pretty simple really. Knowledge is power, people fear the powerful.     4) Self-Assurance  – When someone feels that they do not measure up for any reason, they often tear down another person to make themselves feel better. We’ve all heard this, particularly regarding high-school cliques. When someone feels inadequate, they need self assurance.    5) A sense of accomplishment  – This one sorta goes back to #4. When all else fails, it is simple to tear down someone and feel empowered.     6) Miscommunication  – Look, when you feel that there has been a miscommunication, go to that person immediately, fix it ok? Fix it fast. Fear, knowledge, power and TRUST all play into this one.   I don’t want everyone to like me. I don’t expect that to happen.  I just want everyone to accept me simply for I am.  (This of course goes to others, accept them for who they are... no matter what...) This doesn’t mean that you have to like me, or whoever, what it means that you understand/comprehend that they are who they are, and you do not destroy them for that.    Things cannot always go your way. Learn to accept in silence the minor aggravations, cultivate the gift of taciturnity and consume your own smoke with an extra draught of hard work, so that those about you may not be annoyed with the dust and soot of your complaints. ~ Sir William Osler (1849-1919)    Look, sometimes shit happens.  We do things that piss each other off, we step on a toe, or we just plain hurt each other. Who will be the bigger person? You? Or them?  Sometimes things aren’t fixable, and there is pain. Tell them…. Let them now… move on…. AND ACCEPT.   My blog is entitled “REFLECTIONS ON VALDOSTA COLLEGE LIFE”. This is indeed a reflection of college life, and life in general.  I do love my best friends, and I'm so glad to have you!  BTW, Thank you  Irene  for the flowers!!!  Hope you got something from this – above and below.   Days, how many days Do I have until I am set free to a better place A place of love A place of no tomorrows   Hours, how many hours Do I have until  I am set free to a better place A place of no misery   When will you believe me When I say these things to you No likes a liar baby No one at all When will you receive me  When I say these things to you  ~~~~~~~~  My TV and You It’s the only place to be Nothing else to do Nothing else to see A room without a view Has so much for me and you I was born to stare At stars on ceiling walls  It’s all I need It’s all I ever needed Until the world is gone  Take me how I am ‘cause you know I’ll never change I was born to stare At who stares back at me  If I make it up To that big show in the sky All I really want  Is you  It’s all I need It’s all I ever needed
