Of course they are just as fun and as beautiful as ever and I totally pale in comparison but I just have so much fun with them!  I don't know why we don't do it more often... oh right cause Jen has a boyfriend and Beth and I are busy as hell (although I found out tonight Beth has a new man she's trying out... good luck sweetheart!)
