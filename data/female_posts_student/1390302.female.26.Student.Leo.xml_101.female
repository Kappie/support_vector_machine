I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  It was really nothing like the remake –thank the heavens.  While the remake was terrifying, it was also seriously lacking in content.  Movie remakes are seldom worth two nickels, they are over done and generally nothing like the original, usually that’s a problem but with this movie I it proved to be a delightful surprise.  Sadly, remakes seldom do justice to their predecessors.   Take for example  Anna and the King , a remake of  The King  I .  It was terrible, it didn’t follow the story, they added a whole lot of unnecessary fluff, he didn’t die, and in the end they got together.  What about all of his other wives, Anna’s just going to become another one of the King’s wives?  In the original,  The King  I , the king dies.  It wasn’t sad, he died, he didn’t live to fall in love with Anna.  It was a beautiful story defiled by Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.  I really wanted to enjoy it, I didn’t.  Another example is  The Count of Monte Cristo .  I loved the original; I loved the remake more!  This movie is the perfect example a remake gone right. It had all the right elements, all the right story line, and it added things that only enhanced the story, didn’t detract from it.  Tonight, I really enjoyed  House on Haunted Hill .  Vincent Price is a very spooky guy.  When the movie was over Matt asked me if it scared me?  No, it wasn’t scary but I can see how it could have been in 1959.  The effects were good for such an old movie and the story line was good.  It was only 75 minutes long, so it was not too long or too short but rather just right.  This was actually the first time I’ve seen the movie.  Matt bough me a box set of AMC Movie Classics, 24 movies, 12 disks, $25.00, what a steal!  I haven’t seen any of them but considering that I love old movies, I’m sure I’ll like most of them –if not all.    Tomorrow, Matt is going to buy me some more movies.  I got  How to Marry a Millionaire  when I got the box set and I loved it.  I was actually looking for the Marilyn Monroe Diamond Collection, but no one in town has it. Today, I got  The Seven Year Itch  with MM -though I haven't watched it yet. So tomorrow Matt is going to get me some more of the movies from the Diamond Collection. Probably  Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Bus Stop, There’s No Business Like Show Business, Some Like it Hot, and a few others…  I can’t wait!
