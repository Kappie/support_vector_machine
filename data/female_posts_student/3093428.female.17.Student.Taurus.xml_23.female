OK things are still gonna rule, but it just is taking so much thinking, i was just gonna leave for keats on the 23 and then stay up for the rets of the summer, no complications whatsoever. But now....not so much. I have like yearbook thing, and I am going to this musicx camp that is gonna be totally amazing. Which is cool, i'm still just freakin out!!It's two weeks out of my keats journey, kinda a stinky deal, that two weeks with no Ashleigh, thats no msn or possible phone contact. I'm going to shoot myself in the foot.=w=
