Actually, I'd woken up earlier, like 11 or 12 with really really bad cramps, so i got a shower, and then layed back down because of the pain. I was like crying by the time my mom brought me two aleve and a heating pad. And then I slept...a really long time. I'm better now, thank God. And  that  is why I am getting on the pill within like a week or two...because I can't handle more of that.  Well, adios you crazies.
