Your new boots sound very cool, Dani - very Melissa Auf der Maur, I  bet! A meet up sounds like a great idea. Any suggestions as to when?    We broke up from college on friday. Yay! No more getting up early!  (Until September, that is.) I don't have many plans for the holidays  either, except the fest with you lot.
