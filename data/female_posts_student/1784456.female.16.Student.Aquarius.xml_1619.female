I spend most of it adding stuff to my cupboard... I decorate the front with loads of crap! Yeay! Agh but it's so hard trying to find places for presents to go. And... I'm talking crap again! Come back brain, return to me! I watched the Return of The King yesterday! I can't believe they cut out Sauroman.. or whoever the bad guy dressed in white was. I want to watch the extended one, even if it's five hours it will still be amazing!
