Such is life.   Tomorrow's dress up day. I think I'm wearing pajama pants and a hoodie. Heh heh. YaY! Tomorrow's the last day before break. YAY!!! I'm going out with Kelly, Kathryn, and Mary Clare for our traditional holiday get together/exchange gifts thingy. We're going to dinner then going to Kelly's to watch Christmas movies and just...have fun. At least...I hope it's fun. I have a feeling I'm going to say the wrong thing to Kathryn though. Things are already sort of...tense between us. Ah well. We shall see, we shall see. I need to get a bunch of gifts together tonight. OK, just a few. I only bought gifts for the people who I knew for sure were buying me gifts. I just don't like this whole...getting gifts for people thing. Nobody has enough money themselves to buy anything really nice for someone anyway. Why not spend the money on themselves? I don't know. I guess it sounds sort of mean but...I can't help but think it.   I'm so hungry. Oh my gosh. I had the best fudge after school that Peter gave me. It was amazing. And Kelly gave me a leftover brownie she had from FMP. That was amazing too. Mmm, chocolate. I love people who give me chocolate. Hint hint...wink wink...nudge nudge...cough BRING ME CHOCOLATE cough.  Anyway, I guess I'm going to go do some homework or something. Heh...probably not, but..maybe. I'll at least consider it.
