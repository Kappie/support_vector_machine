We stayed up until 5:30 a.m.!   And today.. went to church with my Dad at St. Vincent's and then out to eat, then came home and went to the pool with Sarah for a while and talked with Madeline, Meredith, Taylor, and Grant. But it's really cloudy and looks like it's gonna rain so we weren't out there long.  Tomorrow Mom, Virginia, and Charles all get home. But then the siblings leave in a few days for camp for AN ENTIRE MONTH!! YES!! I may have a bunch of people over one night, dunno yet.   xoxo
