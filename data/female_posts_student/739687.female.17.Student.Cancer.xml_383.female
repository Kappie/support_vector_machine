I swear they are like hot boy breeding grounds or something. I don't know if that makes sense.  Anyways, this hot boy called me today, but I had left my phone at home and was out.  So he said he'd call back later on the message.  But has failed to do so as of yet.  I thought it was funny that he called in the first place.  Anyways...I guess I'll be going out here in a little bit.  Check it crazies.
