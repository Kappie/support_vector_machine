I can't get over the fact thatfor a woman, a filmsy little shirt that looks like a scrap of fabric cost like $100 and some heavy material that would take decades to make cost like $20. Its not fair!!!!  If you add up the price of makeup, pads, tampons,headache tablets, cramp tablets, CHOCOLATE, and fluffy pillows, women are doomed to live in depth (And thats just what women buy in ONE month, FOR ONE WEEK! Its not worth it!)  I can't wait for menopause. Oh let me stop there before I start going on and on about child birth. I swear during the ordeal I would kill my husband, I would kill him and he would never touch my again.  Men, I just wanna say, you better watch out XD
