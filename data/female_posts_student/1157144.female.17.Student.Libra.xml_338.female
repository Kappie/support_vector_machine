I mean, deep down I want teachers to get more benefits, more money, more respect, more etc. but this blows and there is nothing we can do!  Ms. Burnside put it best: "you all are kids, they don't give a rat's ass about you all!"  It is true, so brutally true that it blows harder than a large-mouthed porno star (I thought Ryan might have gotten a rise or a kick out of that one).  I agree with Val that we should do something.  I was thinking maybe we could do something really witty and cool and piss major people off (of course, all holic people). Also, let me get this straight...  Tomorrow night, everyone is busy?  The carnival is keeping everyone occupied?  What the hell?  When is everybody available to do stuff tomorrow?  Right after school?  After dinner?  For dinner?  Please, I don't want to sit home tomorrow and mastur---you didn't need to know that...
