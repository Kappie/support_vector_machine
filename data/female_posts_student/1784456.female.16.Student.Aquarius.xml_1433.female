(or Sunday depending on how tired I am) But wow, 24hr sunlight! I'm soo gonna have a different view on things after Russia though!!! *so if I'm weird that's why* Sheesh, school won't change! It never does! I could go in minus an arm and no one would notice! (apart from me maybe) Well anyway.... you have fun *whoever you are* go listen to UB 40 - Rat in my Kitchen and think of me! *for all the wrong reasons probably* And some one tell me how good the new Harry Potter book is, cause I'm gonna be in Russia for the whole woohoo duration!
