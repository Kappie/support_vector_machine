Which is sort of silly in a way, because I really haven't had those things for a long time.  But knowing that he doesn't feel the same way, that he isn't out there missing me in the least is what really hurts.  It's what really makes me angry and never seeing him, the fact that he must walk the opposite hallways so that he doesn't see me in the hall.  I hate him and I don't and that makes me all the more angry.
