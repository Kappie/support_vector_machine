Today, tennis was canceled at about 3:15 because it started to rain a lot..so I was all by myself just wandering around prarie..  So, in the halways I kept seeing this guy..he reminded me of Davis a lot..anywho. I kept seeing him..kinda like he was following me..so I was like hmm..Then I was sitting on this bench and he just sta next to me..I wasn't sure if I was supposed to say like "Hey" or something..so I just sat there..and so did he..for like 15 minutes. It was the weirdest thing ever..do people at prarie just sit in silence? Then his mom came and he left..I was like "Hmmm" I think his name was Justin.. He was fairly cute...I hope I see him tomorrow.  Such weirdness this prarie place is..
