The newest Playstaion game where it can be played along side the PCs (that's me!)! And the CGs are certainly more detailed and precise. Now nearing to something about people versus monsters. And as usual, the evil are after something and the heroes are after the monsters and so on... But what is so kawaii and stunning are the characters! The Humes, are the most human- being like while I love the so cute Tarutaru! Their hair, face and height just made me want to run and grab them, emtionally... Haha! Everything is cool, I recommend everybody to view the short clip in the main website. I felt like I was viewing a movie where you just have the urge to play the game. Now, this is what I call online game!
