They are the perception of acheiving goals, maintaining desires, and grasping tranquility. Then, given that we all know how to perceive such emotions, why do we have bad days?  Perhaps we lack faith in the strength of these emotions. With that being said, then perhaps a primary reason for our bad days is the lack of faith in ourselves.  Just a thought.   Anyways, I woke up a little while ago, so I'm still kinda sleepy. Well, not much else to say.  I'm off to perceive a good day. C-ya crazies.
