We were couped up in the classroom for 4 stinking hours without a break because he forgot to give us one..or two..I was seriously about to kill someone. we didn't even talk about driving most of the time!!! On the bright side...this whole thing will be done in a month and I can have a summer!! It has been raining here. And cold...like winter...without snow. I want it to be summer!!! I am sick of rain. I want it to be warm. Maybe next week...
