The second we were doing good b/c we won our first 2 games!  Then lost our last game to get, I think, 8th place!  So Im not real sure whether we are going to nationals or not!  I am totally stressing over my performance here lately!  I have totally been screwing up on offense!  I struck out this weekend probably about 8 out of the 10 times I was at bat!  UGH I HATE BATTING!  Actually I used to be good but I got bad all the sudden!  Anyways Im going to go to a hitting coach so maybe that will help me!  Well this may not seem that important to ya'll, but heres the catch!  This weekend the most important person in my softball life came to my games this weekend and I played the worst I have ever played! (MY COACH)  Oh well things will get better I know they will!  I have some ,kinda, good news!  Leah and I are kinda on good terms now but I'm still having quite a few doubts!  I pray that things will get better between us everyday but I just dont feel that much improvement but I think we are making somewhat of an improvement!!  Does that make sense??  I dont know why but I just cant understand why all this is happening!  I made a mistake but who doesnt?  No one is perfect but then again if she did what I did then I would probably be feeling the same way!  Thats the difference between the 2 of us, she is such a great person and Im just liked b/c I can crack a few jokes here and there!  Otherwise I would probably be a total outcast!  Oh well! Im also really stressing over my "health"!  My mom woke me up at 5 45 this morning to yell at me b/c she thought I ate alot of "sweets" that I didnt eat last night!  So now she has me worrying!  So I went running with my sister this morning, which was quite a challenge considering I havent run any kind of distance in probably 2 months!  I did pretty good though I only stopped to tie my shoe and we have a hill too!! So Im somewhat excited!  Its hard going through high school when you look like I do!  I want a boyfriend so badly but all the guys go for all the skinny beautiful girls!  My time will come I know! I just want to rush things and have all these wonderful things right now instead of maybe waiting and it all be better then than now!  Its also kinda hard making friends but I have done quite well with that considering its hard for me to open up from my very shy side!  Let me just say this, if it werent for band then I would have maybe 25 friends!  Ok well I guess Ill quit complaing but there isnt really anyone I can talk to now!  OH WELL!!  LIFE IS GREAT OTHER THAN ALL THE BAD STUFF I LOOK AT!  I just tell myself to keep praying keep praying b/c God will never give me anything I cant handle!  I know these things!  I just like to complain!
