See, I have always had this little superiority thing. I always seem to think I am better than everyone. I know even know why, becasue i'm not. But God was just like Laura, your not better than anyone. You make all these mistakes.  But I still love you. I ALWAYS will love you.  And because of that love I am here today.  See, if it wasn't for God I would probably have a horrible life right now. As a child, I always wanted to make MYSELF happy. If any of you were my friends back then, I am sorry. I would always brag about my material possesions and try to make all of my friends feel lowly. While I was still singing "Jesus Loves Me" in sunday school, I was also stealing money from my mum so I could buy candy at fred meyers. While I blew out 10 candles on my cake I was convincing my friends that I was fluent in spanish and I was going to be a foreign exchange student. All of this I remember. At my birthdya party I mumbled nonsense and tried to make people think it was spanish for, "I am going to beat you at air hockey!" Which I also did...but I kinda cheated... Kinda.  In the seventh grade, I cheated a lot to.Then I put on my goody goody smile and reported the "bad kids" who cheated on the test to my teacher.    All of this I did while I still muttered the words "I love Jesus."  In the seventh grade I convinced my friiend she was going to hell.  Even though I, myself was also headed that direction.  I have always hid behind this portrait of lies.  But now, its gone.  See, recently I have fallen in love with jesus.  Fallen in love with God.  and I don't seem to think its at all falling.  Its rising Upwards.  To the chalenge.  Because now I will no longer live behind a portrait of lies.  Because, my eternal mask is gone.  let this be known, i'm not perfect, I never will be.  The prodigal son was not perfect. But he ran back to his father and his father forgave him.  The same way with me and jesus.  This has been a year long process but its finally coming together. I kinda like it.   Its a different kind of free.  Now about  Jamica!  I might go there on a mission trip in December! Please pray for me that this is what God wants me to do. Thanks guys.
