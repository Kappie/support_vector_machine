I bought a game cube over the weekend as an early birthday present for my divalicious self.  Its purple and it came with 2 free games.  Super Mario Sunshine and Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker.  Wind waker is crack.  I have done nothing but play that game since I got it.  I'm not very far, but its so addictive.  I spent 5 solid hours playing it last night....what the hell!??!  Oh yeah and its purple which is pretty!  3. I am in a REALLY great mood today.  I'm not sure why, but I am....so I'm giving you all a gigantic CYBER HUG  KISS!  ((Everyone!)) *c: (MwAh!)
