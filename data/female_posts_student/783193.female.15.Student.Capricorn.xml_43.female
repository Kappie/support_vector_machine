Ujournal even updated their site-- now there are these little ads at the bottom of the page. They used to be an independent site. I guess I'll have to put in an overview about these past few.. umm, months? Disneyland: The best thing ever in orchestra. We weren't expecting to go, since we couldn't even go to the mall, but hey, I guess Mrs. Cable pulled it off. It was worth everything we missed at school, and more. Oh man, the places we went! And then, we, the orchestra that everyone almost dropped out of, won first place out of everyone, and received an invitation to Chicago! During the awards ceremony, we were going crazy, and cheering at the top of our lungs. Before the awards ceremony, Jessica, Jane, Ro, Jessie, and Rebecca and I were in a group for Disneyland. Well, at first, it was Jane, Jessica, Ro and me, but then Jessie and Rebecca joined in. We went on Indiana Jones first, and scurried around getting fast passes and candy (for Jane) after that. At the half-point check in, we found out that we could go to California Adventure, so after more scurrying and taking pictures (coming soon), we headed over there. We went on the water ride two or three times in a row, and had tons of fun in A Bug's Land. All of us got soaking wet to the skin in the kiddie water play thing, and took pictures with Flik (coming soon). Then, we went in the virtual plane "California" thing, and Ro lost her glasses. Uh-oh. We looked, but couldn't find them, and finally just decided to go on. I made some yummy-licious strawberry water stuff, that only I found, well, yummy-licious. Jessica said it looked like barf. Then, After the awards ceremony, this freaky guy asked me out. I was like.. umm... no. We got back on the buses, but some people were missing! They had gotten lost in Disneyland after the awards ceremony, and we had to wait about an hour for them. During that time, we were bouncing around, all hyped up from the ceremony. Some people fell asleep, though, and I couldn't stop laughing at one person, who I'll leave anonymous. He was hilarious, because the whole time he was making little snorty noises with his nose while he was sleeping, and every once in a while there would be a bubbly hiss. He was in the back, with us, though, so then only Jessica and I were cracking up, and everyone else was looking at us. Well, actually me, because I was practically having a heart-attack. I took a picture of Nathaniel sleeping (coming soon), and other people were makinf fun of him, too, because David Zvarich had put my Medieval Times hat on him, and he still didn't wake up. That was pretty funny, too. I hung around with Flora, April, Lindsay, and Beth until the lost people came back, and then we headed back to sleep some. It was freezing, though, and I had taken off my shoes because my feet were still soaking and becoming all wrinkly, so I had some frozen feet and couldn't sleep much. I forgot to put in anything about the Medieval Times, which was fun, I guess, but kind of loud. And I couldn't concentrate on the fun parts, because I was too busy looking at the horses, which were being twitchy when they were poking them with their little twine-on-a-wire-to-make-you-do-what-I-want-you-to wands. That's just about all the good things that happened there. Back to School: Then, when we came back to school, we were loaded down with all kinds of work. Worst of all, none of us had done any I-Search work, so we had to finish up our projects in way less time than everyone else. Then, I had the Giles project. Jessica and I each sowed a flag. I did Confederate, and she did Union. I finished a while before her, but hers turned out way better. I just gave it to Ro, who wanted to wear it around her waist, to show it off. I laughed, and told her that she would not be appreciated if she did that in public. Then, in Lefkowitz, Jesse and I did our astrology Power Point. I chose to do Uranus (Yoor-uh-nus), and we had to present. Mr. Lefkowitz said we had the best color scheme. Yay. We had our Geometry final, and we started out in Mr. Hierro's room, and it was really noisy, because at the same time, the locker cleanout was going on. If you've had Mr. Hierro, you'd know that his room is practically padded with lockers, and there were all these seventh grade freaks screaming up and down the halls. Then, we were transfered to the library, and people would come in there speaking in a normal voice, and Ms. Saldinger would come bursting out of her office, yelling at them to keep their voices down, because "There are students taking a Geometry final in here." I will finish this later, because my dad is watching The Fellowship of the Ring and eating mango, and he's calling me. Teehee.. I'll be back soon, my pretties!
