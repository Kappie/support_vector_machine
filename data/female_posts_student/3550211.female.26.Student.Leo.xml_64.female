Slate writer,  urlLink Hitchens  makes some very good arguments, or I suppose you could even say accusations, that depict Moore's movie as nothing more then lies.  "To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. To describe it as an exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of "dissenting" bravery."  This guy has a valid argument for every single Moore "fabrication." It's a very interesting article.
