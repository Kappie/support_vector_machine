Do you see blackness of hate? Do you see Grey Shadows of uncertain?  Try to see people with your heart, Instead with your blind eyes. Butâ€¦ Be careful with a blind heart. If it is blind, if it doesn't feel, It may deceive you, Creating an illusion of what is real.  Sometimes we may see, What we don't wanna see. But that's the truth, Your own truth. That you keep for yourself, Closed in your heart.
