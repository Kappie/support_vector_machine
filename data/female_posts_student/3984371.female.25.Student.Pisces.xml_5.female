They say those who can't play, coach. Apparently, those who can't coach, sit 30 rows back, shirtless, shouting obscenities.  "I'm looking for something in an attack dog, one who likes the sweet gamey tang of human flesh. Hmmm, why here's the fellow . . . wiry, fast, firm proud buttocks . . . reminds me of me . . ." -----Mr. Burns  *SIGH* only 2 more days and life will be GRAND!
