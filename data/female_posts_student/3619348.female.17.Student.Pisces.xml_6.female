I was downstairs doing laundry and heard them talking about me, like I was some dorky little brat.  I can’t stand it.  I just went up to my room and shut the door.  My room was wicked clean, it was cold and the windows were open.  I jumped on my bed and looked out the window, the only light from the moon coming from the moon, shining through the leaves of my tree.  I have never laid in the dark like that, well, not when I felt like that.  It was terrifying, for the first time I seriously doubted my family.  Not just the normal doubts, I really thought they hated me.  I dunno….gah.  Then this morning Dad yelled at Laura and Emily, (I was in the shower, lucky) about how all we do is complain about Mom while she works non-stop.  The man used ‘ironing’ as an example apparently.  He said “You guys have mountains of ironing, and you never do anything!”  MY GOSH!  We just got ALL our stuff done yesterday and MOM is the one with an ironing basket that is COMPLETELY overflowing anyways!  SHE rarely even does it!!!  Stress.  Oy.  Well at least I didn’t have to go  ‘Adventureland’ today, Zachs plans changed and he couldn’t make it.  He was bummed and so was I.  But to be honest I am sort of glad it didn’t work out.    Gah!  And I saw pool boy again yesterday.  On Wednesday I was up at dad’s office and he skated by, well, he saw me.  He came over and is like    Aaron: You haven’t been swimming much lately. Camille:  Yeah, I have been pretty busy this week. Aaron:  Ah, well you know, I was just wondering if you wanted to do something sometime…you know you could call me or whatever. Camille: Um, well you see…I am not really wanting to get involved with anyone like that right now…you know what I mean?   You seem like a really nice guy, I just am not seeing anyone right now, but thanks for asking. Aaron:  Oh that’s fine I was just wondering…  Then blah blah blah for about 15 minutes, just small talk.  He actually wasn’t that bad, I think his friends made him seem worse then he actually is.  Still, they are HIS friends.  So after a bit I jut had to say “Well I better get back to work.”  And then he finally skated away.  *smacks forehead*  Then I saw him and his friends skating when I was getting gas yesterday, I filled up, paid outside and got away before he saw me.  *whew*  This is not what I need right now.  Anyways.  I will be alright if I can just get along with the folks.  Oh yeah, its Sophia’s birthday today, little daring.  She has been such a little lover lately, we are going to have her party next week luckily, I don’t have a gift for her yet.
