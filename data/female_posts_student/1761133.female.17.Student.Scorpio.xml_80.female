I wish I didn't let little things get in the way. I cry about not being a good friend. But I was so sure that I was. I've always had friends. I guess ever since my dad died, I've changed...alot. I don't want to be this way. I've had so many dreams about one of you dying. And we never became friends again. I regreted not talking to you, or saying sorry for something. I'm trying to forgive myself. I've given up on religion. I don't know what to believe in. I hope that when I'm older I see a different path in life.
