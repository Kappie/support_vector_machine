Why don't they create sculptures in the likeness of those who were involved? I don't care if they were all White. Cities should hire more latino, black, and other people of color as firefighters. When these people of color get involved in another historical event, then they rightfully deserve their own commemorative sculptures.     Pia is Ching's best friend if I remember correctly.
