Piercing my flesh until the red tears flow out.  Every smile is like a colourful arrow.  Slicing away until I surrender.  Feeling is unknown, the unknown is feeling.  My eyes, my eyes.  So full with sadness.  My eyes, my eyes.  Scratch them out!  How can I stand to see this pain?  This pain.  This pain.  I give up before I start.  Why did you do this to me?  I am terrified of rejection and afraid of love and hate.  If that he love me true, how will I be happy?  Always, forever.  Lost will it be.  To but shrink away into the shadows?  A mind so blank of no thought.  Result, result!  You have done this to me!  If you pity me, you are killing me!
