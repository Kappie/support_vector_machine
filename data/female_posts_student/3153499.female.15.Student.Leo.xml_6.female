The game that I like to play is Comand and Conquer general, grand thef auto vice city and etc...   I also like to play WWF card. I think that the the best deck is Rey Mysterio because of the ability.  The ability is  "Whenever your opponent reverses a card from his hand or backlash deck, you may discard 2 cards. If you do you may continue your turn. Your cards titled 'From the Top Rope' and 'Springboard' is  -5f" . I think Rey Mysterio best maneuver is  'The West Coast Pop'  . It allows you to have a fast victory.
