You're probably going mad for the second book already! I want the forth! :'( Okay, I'm still having that major debate about whether to get the fourth book or buy a different one...? Hmm, I was thinking about taking a teenie weenie little break from FY cause you can have too much of a good thing! (Yeah right!) Any way I'm gonna go watch tv, peace guys.
