So we go to one of my old favorite spots, JW's. I'm all nervous and stuff 'cause I've never gone out with this particular friend- it always messes up my nerves meeing or going out with new people. I did it on Thanksgiving and I got really extremely drunk.... not a good idea. I went with my friend Tina- and of course, being nervous makes ya drink- but when you're with a bunch of ppl who drink too, you drink even more. We went bowling and the drunker I got the better I bowled, but I got waaaaay too drunk and puked before I passed out. Of course, Ms. Tina took pictures of me in my drunken stoopor and I have to be careful that she doesnt release those photos LOL. Anyway, so we get there and immediately the karaoke guy nods and tells me to let him know when I'm ready... Starts hoverin around my table a little bit too. So, I'm tryin to look for a song, I'm already nervous 'cause it's the first time me and Brandon (if yer gonna get pissy when I use yer name, then that's too bad... with all the ppl I know, nobody's likely to know it was you I was talkin bout anyway) OMG this girl sang "But I Do Love You" by Leann Rimes last night.... good song. Anyway (have ya noticed my mind is goin 10 directions yet?)it's the first time me and him have gone out anywhere to hang out so I"m already feelin like I'm just gonna throw up and all nervous. Joel, this guy from my math class walks past me and my whole brain just froze. I freaked out for reasons that are waaaay beyond me even now. It took me half an hour to find a song and I couldnt stop smiling- the game is going just awesome and  I'm gettin a buzz from the alcohol.... it was madness. So I'm like trying to calm down thinkin I'm gonna laugh myself off the stage and this guy gets up and does "Man of Constant Sorrow" and he sounds really pitiful- not bad, just like he's pitiful himself and I couldnt help it. I just had it- was cracking up the whole time he's singin. So I finally get up there, and I'm just slammin this song big time and I come back to sit down and Brandon tells me the pistons are up by 14 WOOT WOOT. So we're singin and havin a good time and I cannot keep the smile off my face all night 'cause we're laughin and hangin out and it's the most awesome thing. Some guy sang the song that they play on Monday Night Football (like the actual song- All my Rowdy Friends are Comin Over Tonight) and some song reminded me of Schoolhouse Rock- do you remember that show? Some guy told me I was like in my 30's just because I knew some of the stuff on it. WTF? Who didnt see SchoolHouse Rock??? Ya know, when you were little, Saturday Morning cartoons were the only thing you lived for. Now they got a bunch of nonsense on there on Saturday. I miss the good old days. The good old days of anything- do you remember when chat was chat?? No bots, no assholes startin shit- maybe occaisionally but not on a frequent basis. No booters, no teenyboppers in the rooms all the time- of course, we made user rooms then too. We didnt stay and close the bar so I went to my neighborhood bar- Jans. Oy my friend Dan punched me in the arm- (of course I punched him like 10 times first) it did not feel nice. Didnt hurt too much but it didnt feel good either. Perfect example of why hangin out with guys is cool. You can be one of the guys and not worry about them tryin to molest ya all the time hehe... gotta go. Laters
