Then that night was Chris's grad party. i mean, in my last entry i said that there was a lot of stuff going on..well that doesnt compare to everything at Chris's! it was like frigin soap opera, it was funny and retarded all at once. but we had a good time, we sat in the hot tub a lot, we stayed until like 1 am..good times! chris was sad..aww him sad made me sad...because he is moving up north to go to a rich private school..aww im going to miss chris! he always kept the group talking and laughing, always! after the party we went to shaunas and slept over, jenn, taylin, sheena, shauna and i. it was pretty fun too.   Saturday- i hung out at em's  allllllll  day long! and we did nothing! but it was still great! we watched like half of remember the titans, we ate like crazy, we had a romantic strawberry eating fest in the middle of the field on a blanket. i lost 30$! we were fighting desperately to find plans but we couldnt. so we just bummed around! t'was grrrrreat!  Sunday- well rob and matty called me at around 1:30, so i went to mattys, then when i got there we called josh. at joshs house was ian carly n shauna. so we all hung out, and we did like nothing..went to the park, watched tv, played cards etc. i went home at like 5. i couldve gone to the movies, but i didnt really want to see what they were seeing plus i lost my money haha so i couldnt anyway. i was supposed to clean my room but id idnt, i watched secret window with my mom. it was really confusing i didnt quite understand it. oh well..  Monday- i cleaned my room  all  afternoon!!  it's so clean im sooo proud and impressed! so then shauna called me and asked me to hang out later then sleep over, so i did so. shauna, josh, ian, matty, robert, austin, em and i hung out. we didnt nothing again all night, but it was still fun. then shauna and i had a sleepover, and we like....i dunno we put on weird radio stations and did these dance/play things. it was so retarded but awesome! they could be famous, so could we if we wanted to be.  Today- well i woke up early and i had a orthodontist appt... GUESS WHAT!?   im probably going to my braces off in like..2 months!most likely before school starts! YESHHHHHHHHHH! im so happy. i dunno what im doing today, probably just lazing around and hanging out. mehhh!!  anywho...yes yes, im in a pretty good mood, im not pissy about anything too in particular at the moment. i'll let you know when i am. haha! ciaoo!  -chels-
