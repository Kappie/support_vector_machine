Tots and feel and all..   Let this be a different prayer from the rest. Let this not be a regular, mediocre prayer. Let this be a strong prayer. A fervent prayer.  Allow me to dig in deep to retrieve the hidden secrets tat ought to be prayed about.   Truly Lord, there's none other who's greater than you. I ask for God's hand to be upon me and my family. I pray for a great financial breakthrough in my family.  Lord as I work towards breaking out of my bad habits, I pray Lord that you'd give me a breakthrough in my life. A spiritual breakthrough. A financial breakthrough. Lord I pray that my private worship will be more beautiful to you than my public worship. Before I think of helping others, I have to first strengthen myself. Strengthen my faith, my knowledge of the Word, I pray for the anointing of the Holy Spirit. To refresh me, renew my mind, convict my heart and change my life.   Father I want to be able to pray strong like the rest. Not to be afraid of prayer meetings. Not to be fearful of not knowing how to pray. For the Bible says, "Be strong and of good courage, for I am with you always, even to the ends of the earth."  Lord I pray that'd be no distractions in my life to take me away from You. Take all these distractions and temptations away. I want to focus on You. To know you more. To serve You. Dear Jesus, more than anything else, I want to know You more intimately. I want to know You more. I pray for a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit that'd change my life.   Holy Spirit, help me break the sin of silence, help me to be bold to speak of Jesus to my friends. That you'd put the right words in my mouth. That I'd invite them at the right time. That their hearts would be so open. And that I'd be a great testimony. That my frens and family will see the change in me bcos of Jesus. And they'd believe that God is a good God. That as I ask my frens to church, I'd not be discouraged, not be scared if I get rejected. But that I'd keep trying and trying. Keep believing and believing. And trust that as I sow the seed today, somewhere along the way, someone else will reap the fruits of labour and my frens and family would be saved.   I pray O'Lord that me and him will remain as frens. Truly Lord, let Your kingdom come, Your will be done. Not my will. Not his will. But Your will Lord. If he's the one, You'd tell me. You'd give me a sign. But before I hear anything from You Lord. Let us just remain as frens. Maybe we'd always only be frens. If that's your will dear Jesus, then let it be. Dear Lord, I don't want to force anything that's not supposed to be. I'm tired of fighting, of struggling. I give it all to You. I pray You'd fight in my place. For You are the Father Almighty. The king of kings. And the Lord of Lords.  Help me to be more Christ-like. To curb the bad temper. To be meek. To be more respectful. To be more patient. Not to be judgmental. Not to be weak or to think lowly of myself. Help me build self esteem. That one day, my light will shine. I'd be the salt and light to the world. Lord, I believe you've given me a dream. To be a missionary for you dear Lord. To win souls for you. To plunder hell and populate heaven in Jesus name. So, mould me dear God. To become the person You want me to be. To fulfill the destiny You have for me in this lifetime. Help me forsake the relationships that I have to forsake. Change the ways that needs to be changed. Abandon the habits that should be left behind. My new man has been born. Now let my new man be strong. Help me handle my finances well. Help me lead a strong prayer life. To be spiritually filled as well as biblically well equipped.   And finally, I pray for God's presence to be with me every single day of my life. Holy Spirit, fall upon me. Help me make the right decisions in life, in school, at home, at work. I love You and I praise you. In Jesus mighty name I pray, Amen.
