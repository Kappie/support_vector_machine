I tried to keep a positive attitude and just smile but eh I dunno, maybe it's just me p.m.s.ing..I don't know..all I know is I want this feeling to end "My life's disassembled and my self esteem gone, will this feeling ever end" hehe I made that up..okay I got out of school before 8th pd, I'm sorry I left you ana, I still love you most. Jessie, me and her sis went to Kmart so she could get a white t-shirt. Her sis is so cute. Then me and Jessie went to my house. We were bums for a while and just watched tv, signed yearbooks, ate cheeze its and ya then I felt bad cuz she looked bored so we went to Woodfield. I can't drive btw so I scared her cuz we were fooling around supposedly checking out a guy in this one car so I was looking at the guy but as I was looking I was turning the car too so I was an inch away from this car almost about to hit him and only realized it when Jessie screamed. argh I suck lol. Then we went to Woodfield, walked around, got fat from eating, felt lonely cuz we are haha and went to Pac Sun..what I think is that nerd, i'm sorry he gave it all up like that it's dumb and i believe in fate so if things r meant 2 happen again it will i'm just so sad u look sad when u think about it.."what's ur problem, ur making the biggest mistake of ur life" anywho who am I 2 give her love advice, i suck at it too. So then we left and drove 2 c some people's houses hehe and went home 2 watch miss universe w/my mom and she left at like 9:30ish..k i'm going 2 go lie down ick NOT looking 4ward 2 2morrow bye though...
