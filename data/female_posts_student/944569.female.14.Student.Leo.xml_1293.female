This blog has a total of 11 members (including me in that count) and no one is posting?  We've pulled through grade 7 together on this blog.  Let's finish up grade 8 in a grand flourish to show our dedication to this blog.  I can't believe some people just joined and never posted up a single thing.  >:( I'm afraid I can't let anyone be able to be proud of being on this blog if they never post.  You can't just join for the sake of bragging that you're on this site.  You have to help somehow to help it grow and blossom.  >_ :D
