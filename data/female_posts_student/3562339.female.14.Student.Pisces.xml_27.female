It was strange, and I kind of refused to make an appearance until the last hour. Though I was forced to help with the preperations by the evil, slave driving parents. NEVER GET A POOL! It requires waaay too much work. I had to hand vacuum it today, and dang is that thing heavy, and it took forever. Grrrr. And no one even swam. What a waste. I actually had an excuse not to go to the party though. I was "packing", or more like waiting for my clothes to dry because my dryer is retarded. Grrrrrrrr.       I finally actually got down to packing at around 6, and I'm currently not finished yet, though I'm close. w00t. Somehow, it seems like I haven't packed as much this year, but whatever. I probably over packed anyways, like I always do. At CTY, I still had clothes that I never wore once. Bleh, labeling everything is what took me so long. It's such a PAIN IN THE ASS. Okay, that's my outburst for the day. Hmmmm... I should probably get back to packing.      Oh yeah! I almost forgot! I got a haircut on Thursday and now my hair is like shoulder length. I didn't want to get that much off, but my mother made me because apparently I have split ends, which somehow, I am unable to see.      ...la Gu      Contact meh:      Eugenia Dellapenna   c/o Appel Farm Arts and Music Center   P.O.
