Well, it started out that we would have our like own island, like, in the tropics, and it would be our own country and us and our closest friends could live on and like if people wanted to come to see us they would need a visa issused by us and if they didn't have one they coulnd't come. But then we thought, "What if there were native people there? It wouldn't be nice to kick them out." So, we came up with an even BETTER idea. A BOAT! We named it the SJS No Worries cause this is like a floating paradise! Okay, there would be a big room for all the girls that like lived on the boat, and all the boys would get one too, and like there would be extra rooms called "Happy Rooms" for if any of us wanted to be alone or if when we docked we met someone we liked (wink wink). So, then there would also be a big pool, dining hall, and at the bottom there would be a like dancefloor and a place for a DJ or something and thats where we would party and stuff. And like, if any one but the people who lived on the SJS No Worries wanted to come aboard to visit, they would need to get a pass from us. Only the way they would get a pass would be all of the people who lived on the boat would have to vote on it. Like, say someone some of us liked wanted to come on, a majority vote would have to happen for them to get a 2 day pass and at the end of the 2 days if they have behaved then we will have another vote and then they can stay longer. But if ANYONE (except for me and Erica caues, hey, it's our boat) got annoying, they would have to walk the plank onto a row boat and row back home from where ever we are. They will be given food and water of course. So this thing would be soooo awesome cause like, it just would be. No one to like tell us what we can and cannot do, nothing to worry about. But just so we don't get stoopid, we would have schooling on Mondays from 8 a.m. till 8 p.m. a full day. It would all be good though cause then we have the rest of the week to do what ever we wanted. And it's not even like we would get bored cause we would like go from like country to country meeting people and partyin like rock stars do! It would be perfect. Just perfect.
