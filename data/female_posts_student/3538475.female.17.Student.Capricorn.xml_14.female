Counselling went strangely.  I realised a few things and worked out a few things.  I don't feel, I think and I still surprise her with my honesty and self-awareness.  She gets the impresison I have trouble expressing my emotions because I don't feel my emotions I think them.  I'm also turning more and more into my parents by the day and cannot make a tulip a daffodil no matter how hard I try despite what they've instilled in me.  And there I was thiking I was Hermione, so I either have to accept the tulip as the tulip and give up trying to change it into the daffodil or look for the daffodil.  I want to stick with the tulip because he's what I want, when he behaves.  If patience is a virtue I'm not a very virtuous person, I have to learn to be, as far as the tulip goes.  I also have to learn to not jump into the pit but to stand by it.  I think I'm gonna start playing with the toybox next week so I can learn to let the child appear again and so I can learn to relax.  So my task for this week is to think about things that I am doing and my decisions in them and decide am I being an adult/parent?  I need more of the child.  Well I suppose the rveision isn't gonna revise itself...but my tummy's rumbling...
