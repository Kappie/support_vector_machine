I'm so exciting, it must be awesome to spend a year in another country with other cultures! And when I'm back in Germany my English will be really improved! ;)       I'm thinking all the time of my ex-boyfriend. On Tuesday it's 12 weeks when he left me... Yeah, he left me because of another girl... I don't know what likes about her. I know her from seeing and she doesn't seem to be nice; but it's his choice. Now they aren't together anymore and I would like to call him but I think if he would like to talk to me, he would have called but he didn't and so I better leave it this way.   But maybe I'll call him the day before I'm going to leave Berlin and say goodbye...what do you think? Should I say goodbye or should I just leave?
