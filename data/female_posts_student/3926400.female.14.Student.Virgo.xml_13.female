Then we all tried to sleep on my full size bed. It was a  little  crowded to say the least. Saturday Meagan and I went to the mall after Danna left. I bought some cute cargo pants. I  love  them the best already.   Ha, it was funny. I was talking to somebody online last night and they described me as "always having something positive to say." They were using it as a compliment, but I bust out laughing. Half the time I'm cynical (I'm not at the moment, but I have a good weekend to blame for that). But perhaps that's only when I write poetry and such. Anyways, I baby-sat today. Kailie is so hilarious. She started turning around in circles and every now and then she would stop to laugh. It was so cute. But now I'm tired.
