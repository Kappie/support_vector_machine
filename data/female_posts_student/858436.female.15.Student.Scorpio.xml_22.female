They are playing Charleston right now, so I'm wondering how that goes...  Well, I was going to stay with Mandy for a few days during break while Mom, Virginia, and Charles were at the beach at Dad was at the Sugar Bowl, but she's going to Cancun. I really wanted to stay here and spend New Year's with all my friends, but ah well.   So I'm leaving tomorrow morning for Pt. Clear, Alabama. About 30 minutes away from Gulf Shores. The beach is right across the sidewalk from my grandmother's house. We have our own pier and everything. It's really nice. I just wanted to be at home. But... things didn't work out.   My cell phone number is 573-258-0934. Text or call me, please! I don't care who you are. I'd love to hear from everyone and hear what's up. If you give me your address, I'll even send you a postcard.   Love you all.
