ALANIS MORISSETTE    Ironic  An old man turned ninety-eight He won the lottery and died the next day It's a black fly in your Chardonnay It's a death row pardon two minutes too late Isn't it ironic... Don't you think  CHORUS: It's like rain on your wedding day It's a free ride when you've already paid It's the good advice that you just didn't take Who would've thought... It figures  Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye He waited his whole damn life to take that flight And as the plane crashed down he thought "Well isn't this nice..." And isn't it ironic... Don't you think  REPEAT CHORUS  Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you When you think everything's okay and everything's going right And life has a funny way of helping you out when You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up In your face  A traffic jam when you're already late A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife It's meeting the man of my dreams And then meeting his beautiful wife And isn't it ironic... Don't you think A little too ironic... and yeah I really do think...  REPEAT CHORUS  Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out Helping you out  Don't worry I didn't just type that. I copied it. Well anyway... I love this thing because no one else listens to me and this thing dont have a choice. Right now I would laugh sooooooooo much if my computer crashed! Is it just me or do other people feel like when they hear a beautiful song they want to get lost in it and just fly away to a different world? Well im that kind of person... I dont see why people describe themselves as wierd. Im not wierd, Im unique (yeh I know my heads big but im proud of what I've made of myself and I dont know why people aren't happy with their appearance - everyone is beautiful. I'm really not good at expressing myself so I'm sorry if it dont make sense!!! Well no ones exactly going 2 be reading this so I could rite anything HA HA HA (evip cackle!!!) but I won;t! Its my dads birthday today, he is now officially half a century old!!! I can't wait until I have kids - I've got the names sorted out already! Myron Chester Brett is going to be the son of Chester Bennington (Lead singer in Linkin Park). Justin John is my second son, his dad is Justin hawkins (Lead singer in The Darkness). My one and only daughter will be the most special little girl in the world, shes going to be called Iris (I think ive said already why that names special to me!) Anyway... her dad will be John Rzenik (Lead singer in Goo Goo Dolls). But then I wanna settle down and just enjoy my life as a lawyer with fat legs and just marry the most beautiful man I can find... I need another band to come out first, before I decide who it is... though I am looking along the lines of the guy in Muse... not thats what I call beautiful! Well I'm going to talk to my special friend now (Russ) he is the most kindest and genuinely nice guy you could possibly find and we're going to marry if we're still single (and alive) at 198. It's really good because he's found God and he totally deserves it! Well everyone does. Well I'm going to go now because I'm getting emotional (in a good way!) well take care and god bless love u jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
