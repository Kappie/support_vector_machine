You gotta agree, there are just some people who, when put in the same room with them, you'll just be friends, you won't be able to help it.  And of those people that you just get along with, there are going to be some who will understand you and what you're saying no matter what curves you throw, no matter how much you resist or hide.  My curly-haired QueenMo is one of those.  We've been friends for...what?  Four years?  Maybe a little less, I think Shelley's "push" took some time.  But, whatev--it's still a long time.  My Queen (ella es muy linda, thanks SPA100) throws me curves allll the time, and that's what we're all about.  In person, it's all laughs, and then the writing gets more serious.  It's like living a double-life, instead it's having a double-friendship.  Though we're only one person each, we're two people to each other, depending on the context, the medium, etc.  With that in mind, and reaffirming the absolute truth that this blog is of course a record of one's most personal tid-bits, shared in the most public of forums ( the internet, eh?  I hear they have that on computers now... ) I would like to use this opportunity to share a dialogue between us.  I am amazed (and I think in total agreement with something QueenMo said a few emails ago) about how frank and honest she (and I) can be in written form.  Sometimes saying something outloud makes it just too real, and when it's hidden in this code of letters and words, well, it just doesn't seem so soul-bearing.  Or it does, but it doesn't leave that vulnerable aftertaste.  As much.  But getting back to the original point, it amazes me just how eloquently she is able to present her 'confessions' because there are some things that I have seen in my life that I would never want to think about again, muchless discuss, muchless put into writing.  She is afraid that I find her to be distant or cold.  I have never found that this is a quality that she possesses, and it's kind of breath-taking that she might think that about herself.  QueenMo, you might disagree--maybe you have ample reason to believe that you've acted this way with me before, but I haven't noticed.  And perhaps I haven't noticed because I am often the same way.  And perhaps that is one of the many reasons why you and I relate so well.  We share so many of the same mannerisms, however you possess a great deal more honesty and perspective than do I.  My blog has been 100% a confessional.  It's better than when I was a practicing (pretending) Catholic.  When Bridget discovered it, it all came crashing down (she's my best-friend, I've known her since we were 5, and we've been through some serious shit together...but still...)  I felt like I had been revealed prematurely, and I started censoring what I was writing.  And then, I figured, fuck it.  This is who I am, and anyone who knows me will hear the censor, and will be able to read between the lines.  Then I'll just be half a person, however "protected" I feel.  So with that in mind, QueenMo opened her blog from day1, and she's been cute and funny, but also deeply personal.  Like in emails to me, which are so often light-hearted and lift my spirits, she can also be so succinctly honest and thoughtful that it's sometimes a little disarming.   "The important thing is this: to be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become."  - Charles Du Bos  I usually END my emails with this quote, but it has given me a ridiculous amount of insight and motivation that I think it works perfectly right here.  She has said to me in several communications that she feels like she needs someone/thing to love unconditionally with all her heart.  Perhaps she needs to turn that caring light on herself???  What's needed here is a change.  And a big change too.  You need to not just think about quitting this job, you need to actually do it.  I have found that the best jobs are never, never advertised--the idea, of course, is that those who are most qualified will know to come looking, the employer doesn't need to spend an ounce of energy seeking out new employees.  Heck, when I got my current job, it sure as fuck wasn't advertised.  I just applied, and I got it.  In a couple of weeks, my aunt is taking me to the publishing trade fair that I think I may have mentioned earlier in my blog.  She said it should only take me about 3 hours to look around the place and figure out what these people are like and who I wanna work for.  Any job that I get will never be advertised, it will be a case of me putting myself out there and hoping that a few prospective employers deem me a good fit for their company.  Don't flip through the paper or check on the internet for jobs.  As we know, the internet is an almost entirely useless plethora of information.  Lots of crap.  You need to find a company that you wanna work for, and apply.  Not even for a particular job, but apply to them with your mindset, your goals, your ambition, and see if it's a fit.  It sounds like she thinks she wants a baby.  Now that I've got that in black  white, it seems a little silly.  But it's understandable.  When a million women around you that you respect and admire and love are starting to be familially inclined, it's totally natural for a woman to think it might be what she wants too.  But as we know, some people are just not like everybody else.  Mo, you're something a little more different, a little more SPECIAL, and you can't just take the same path that everybody else does.  Personalities like ours should never use living things as means to ends -- we tend to abuse them.  Which is not to say "harm", but we can exploit the unconditional love that a dependent being gives us, and take it for granted.  Maybe that's just me.  OK, definitely that's me, but are you picking up what I'm putting down?  Speaking just for myself, what I need more than anything is to learn to appreciate what I have.  Isn't that just the meaning of life, but in all seriousness, I have a really easy time of taking things for granted, because I'm just handed far too much.  I need to suffer.  I need to move out of my house, stop having Mom  Dad driving me around, cooking and cleaning for me, and all the rest.  I need to come home to an empty apartment and feel really, really lonely, because that's when I'll come to fully understand the importance of surrounding oneself with love-people (as in, reciprocation.)  As for the agony of mirrorizing yourself (yup, I just made up that word, I think...)  I do it too.  It's brutal to try and figure out what it is other people see when they look at you.  I have felt my entire life like I've never been taken seriously, and yes, you know what I mean.  People think that because I'm cute I couldn't possibly have any idea of how the world works, or any idea in my head at all.  Some people think they need to protect me, others think they can exploit me.  I'm sure there are lots of people who know me and don't think anything like this, but they are a few and far between.  There's nothing intrinsically evil in that, but I'm not a friggin' puppy.  You picking it up?  So, my question to you is this: is my understanding of my identity in other people's eyes correct?    Intimacy is a crazy, fucked-up thing.  As we know, sex and intimacy are two totally different things, and they CAN go together, but this is not always necessarily the case.  I have a lot of sex, but my more "intimate" relationships are rare; there aren't that many people that have seen me naked on the outside AND the inside.  Because the inside, for some unknown reason, is much more closely guarded.  The body is perishable, impermanent, temporal; the soul is ethereal, transcendent, evanescent.  The biggest difference, and the primary motivating factor for having sex is just for the sake of the physicality, just to be reminded to enjoy the part of you that will one day be no more.  I do it because it's fun, sure, but also because it lets me forget about the samsaric abyss that we are swimming in.  But the effects are short-lived, like cocaine, and soon enough I need more.  Or else I need less.  Perfect segue into my choice of celibacy...  This line was intense, which is why I'm going to restate it here, "when i'm nervous or fearful - i am stone.  i'm  riveted by emotional displays of any kind though.  most of me seems to still be hovering above my body watching, crying and waiting for it all to end."  Holy crap.  I can't help but see myself in that illustration.  Anil complained that I was over-sensitive, that it was likely an echo of the break-up with Brent.  What he totally doesn't understand is that the "sensitivity" he thinks he was getting was a farce.  He's not close enough, he doesn't know jack-shit about me, and yeah, I'll fuck him (damn, that sounded crass,) but I'm sure as hell not going to explain shit to him that he couldn't possibly understand (which is not a fault per se, but just the nature of his personality being conflictual with mine.)  Some of my best-friends still have no idea that I'm going in for surgery on Monday.  Why haven't I told them?  Because I just don't want to get emotional, it's so draining.  How's that for a positive attitude?  Faak.  It's terrifying to feel alone, and it's totally human to be terrified.  But it's also like being afraid of the dark.  We are afraid of what we don't know, what we can't control, of things that can affect us that are outside of our sphere of influence.  But it's irrational to be afraid of such things, because there are way scarier things within our sphere of influence that we CAN control, but don't because we are paralyzed by that irrational fear.  Being alone won't kill any of us (not in the figurative sense, at any rate) and being rejected won't either (perhaps being Ejected from a moving car, but that's neither here nor there...)  It hurts but it doesn't kill, and it's one of those things that's mostly out of one's hands anyway.  Shit, it sounds like I'm calling you irrational, but believe me, I'm not.  We are all irrational creatures, so really, that just makes you and me part of the club.  I'm not sure what else to tell ya.  I think I'm all philosophed out.  Burp.
