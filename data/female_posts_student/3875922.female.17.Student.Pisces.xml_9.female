YAY  im free again. im back to being able to prance around frantically, dancing (like a fool) along to really really crappy music. as soon i put slade on, WOW. then it moved on to heavier stuff. metal, is, as george says, a saviour.  seriously. how do people survive without music? or the love for music? YOU LUNATICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  xxk
