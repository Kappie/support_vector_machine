So to get on with my story; yesterday i was doing the laundry and by mistake left the dryer door open. I had just finished folding the close and and left it open. So i went up staris to go to sleep. This Morning i wake up and go back down stairs to watch some t.v. I thoght my bunny had no food left so i went to feed her. I had gone to her little room were we keep her and she wasn't there. i was very confuse becase theres like this wall fense that gose half way up, so she couldn't had jumped it. next thing i see is the wall to the side and it had a huge hole in it. That was when i relized she had chewed throw the wall!( the wall was like wooden ) I told my dad, mom, and brother what she did and we all started looking for her. She can clime stairs so my brother and mother went to look upstairs. Me and my dad stayed down stairs too look for her. It was about 2 hours after i saw the dryer door open, as i went to close it i saw her there sleeping on top of all the clean clothes. .....i just stod there in amaisment. My dad walked over to me and saw her so he begain to laughf. So i told my brother and mother where she was and the searh was over......later today my mom found the back of her couch all chewed up and all the phone cords riped. She wasn't to happy. Well thats my bunny story. :)
