But anyway this  is a time of news and gossip, well i dont have any at the time, so well, I guess i will have to talk about other stuff.  I am going camping again tomorrow(wednesday), its going to be fun. Well i guess its not camping, but well what else do i say yurting?? Well that works. Anyway we are going up the coast, near devil's lake.  Joelles leaving on thursday, guess i will have nobody else to share gossip with, considering she is the only one i really talk in the summer, except kyle. He is a great person to talk to. You know, I think he is the first person I can relate with on a regular basis. No offense joelle, love you to death. I was reading your blog kyle, and your first entry where you are going on about the relationships, you know i feel the same way. I haven't had as near amout of relationships as  you, but i have alway felt the same way about them when i am in them. I know that really didnt make a lot of sence. But make out what you can lol. More later, bye.
