Im not feeling very remorseful about it though because I knew it was coming..ah well maybe now we can do that rock band.. speaking of bands, my bday is coming up soon.. having a huge jam/BBQ party! Hopefully. I was thinking toga at first but that many people in togas would just be too much. We'll start at a lower number and work our way up.  My throat hurts, I shouldnt complain but Im beginning to think I have no immunities at all. Screw you Tyler for drinking that juice before I did. But it was so yummy..  Today was one of those days where your sitting in school and your there and everything, but your minds not.. and you dont feel like doing work or writing or doing anything really, and it sucked. Luckily I had 2 subs so I didnt really do anything. After school I met up with tyler, got a glass thrown at me, kicked matt out of the band, and went on an adventure that turned out to be going to see a rugby game then to carlys. Now no one can ever say I dont have school spirit! Well I dont but I went to a rugby game.. does that count for nothing? I had my sweater on and everything too..  Nevermind the fact that I sat on the Rural side..details I tell you. Im really tired so Im going to bed. That was a lie but I have nothing else to say. Night..
