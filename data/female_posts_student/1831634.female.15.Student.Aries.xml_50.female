I'm on a big ginny/draco kick lately.  lol.  so cute!  MY ALLERGIES ARE KILLING ME.  Willow bend mall is awesome... no pollen in it at all.  after school today, we were filming, and I almost DIED.  my eyes were KILLING me.  I seriously could not open my eyes because of all the pollen.  I had to wet them every few minutes just to get them to work... egads.  it was not fun.  march is not a very fun month for me.  me: mom, my allergies are bothering me. mom: let's go see a doctor. me: why don't you just go ask jack's mom? mom: why don't you just get to her clinic and become her patient? me: you know, I do believe my allergies are getting better; we don't have to go! mom: I'll ask jack's mom. me: yay. mom: I still think you should become her patient. me: NO WAY. mom: but it's mean to keep taking advantage of her like this. me: I know. mom: you should become her patient. me: but MOM, she's JACK SUN'S MOM. mom: so? me: JACK SUN'S MOM. mom: so? me: he's gonnna know EVERY LITTLE THING WRONG WITH ME.  cuz she's gonna TELL HIM.  cuz she's JACK SUN'S MOM. mom: so? me: that's nooooot goooooood.  I don't WANT him to know every little thing wrong with me. mom: why? me: it's EMBARRASSING. mom: but he's such a nice boy. me: no he's not.  he's freaking mean. mom: but he's so nice! me: yeah, right. mom: I think you should go to sleep now.  and you should still get jack's mom to be your doctor. me: good night, mom.  and no.  I do believe I'm beginning to sound like kailing.  how scary!  not that it's bad or anything.  but scary nonetheless.  skanky!  I like that word.  b/c it sounds cool.  too bad it's not a very good word.  I HAVE TO REMEMBER TO BRING MY EYEYDROPS TO LISA'S TOMORROW, OR ELSE I WILL DIIIIIIIE.  good night, all!
