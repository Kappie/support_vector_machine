Adia I'm empty since you left me  trying to find a way to carry on  I search myself and everyone  to see where we went wrong   'cause there's no one left to finger  there's no one here to blame  there's no one left to talk to honey  and there ain't no one to buy our innocence  'cause we are born innocent  believe me Adia, we are still innocent  it's easy, we all falter  does it matter?   Adia I thought we could make it  but I know I can't change the way you feel  I leave you with your misery  a friend who won't betray  I pull you from your tower  I take away your pain  and show you all the beauty you possess  if you'd only let yourself believe that  we are born innocent  believe me Adia, we are still innocent  it's easy, we all falter, does it matter?  believe me Adia, we are still innocent  'cause we are born innocent  Adia we are still  it's easy, we all falter ... but does it matter?     when i first the song Adia by Sarah McLachlan, i thought it was:  a) a lesbian break up song;  b)a song about sexual abuse; or  c) a song about broken friendships.    a song is always open to different interpretations but when i heard about the movie  urlLink Monster  , i said to myself, "wonderful! a movie that fits the song to a T". i haven't really watched the film, i don't think it was ever shown here in the R.P. but i have heard its story over and over from friends and you sorta wonder, did they use Adia for the soundtrack?       look at this: Aileen Wournos was a prostitute who never felt loved when she was growing up. she meets Selby Wall, who became her girlfriend. later on, Selby, her only trusted friend and lover betrays her. it's so sad yet so gripping (my frail attempt at film review and to think i didn't even get to see the film). i mean, i could relate to both the story and the song, not that i was ever a prostitute who killed her clients, but i did have to work to sustain my three-year lesbian relationship.   i may never ever get to see this film, but i will always get to listen to sarah mclachlan.and everytime i do get to hear the song, i'd remember the film and the story of the woman who loved so much she'd kill for it.
