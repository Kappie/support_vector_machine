       
      I got myself a shiny new computer. I can't wait to pick it up. It's a  urlLink Thinkpad T42.    33 years old, and I've never bought myself a computer. I've only gotten them as gifts. This is a  urlLink review  I found on it. I'll give my own review once I get my hot little hands on the darn thing.
