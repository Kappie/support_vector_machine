Picked up Rachel, drove half way to Floresville, picked up Melinda. Went to Hemisfair, waited for David and Thomas, they got there. Got wet in the water fountain. Smoked cigs with Jeanette. David and Rachel made out. Adan and Elias finally arrive. We walk to the river. Don't talk to Adan or Elias. Hang out by the river. Rachel and David made out. Everyone jumps in the river except for Elias, Jeanette and me. Then Elias goes in. Elias throws a duck egg at me and Jeanette, misses me by an inch. I throw Adan's new beanie in the river, Melinda's bracelet accidently swings off my wrist. I yell at people, people yell at me. Jeanette and me hang out with a dog at a pit stop we make on our way back to Hemisfair, everyone else goes ahead of us. Jeanette and me go to McDonald's and buy soda, then go to Hemisfair. We play hide and go seek with Melinda and Thomas. David and Rachel make out. Melinda and Thomas stay hiding in their "house" for the rest of the time, and have a moment later. David and Rachel made out. I swing, Jeanette swings. We sit on a bench, Jeanette leaves me to go talk to Adan after I just bitch at David, Rachel, Adan, and Elias. I almost fall asleep on a bench. Mark calls and says he still doesn't have our shit. We leave. Drop off Rachel at her house. Melinda and Jeanette stay here for a while. They make food, Melinda leaves. Jeanette and me watch Head of State and then Ice Age. I talked to Alek for the rest of the night.
