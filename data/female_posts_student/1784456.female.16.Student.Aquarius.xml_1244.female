Let the days pass, Let the families grieve. The death brings us all to our knees. We're truly sorry that this happened, That you won't live to fight another day. But you are the innocent casualties of war, And that's all we have to say. Maybe you'll be reincarnated, And another war will begin, And all you can do is stand there, And wait for the end of your life.  Katie Sims  This is my Anti-War poem. To the guy that reviewed this saying: "Rather broken rythm adds a feeling of dread to a pretty good piece, one complaint...its truly, not truely. Other than that, I liked it" It is true. Open your eyes and for god sake learn how to spell! It is sooo truly truly! Isn't it guys? I thought it was! *sniff sniff* Okay, I'll cut the crap and go write some more! Woohoo! Haha, but I won't be the one forced to read them! Muhahaaa! Geez, I kind of get the feeling that these blogs are getting more and more pointless, oh well!
