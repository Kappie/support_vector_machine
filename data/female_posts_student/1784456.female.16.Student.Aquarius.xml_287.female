Any way I'm now going to confuse you all by pulling a carrott out of a hat (don't ask!) So umm here's my recommended thingy to listen to Instant Message - Edna's Goldfish that rules! Edna's Goldfish are cool, wierd name though! But hey, can I talk? I'm kind of into ska though so it might be a bit wierd for some of you lot. Yeah I started blabbing about some thing else but I got scared! Hey...wonder if I can add a about us bit? Hmm I should be able to! Oh if it all goes black it was Izzy!
