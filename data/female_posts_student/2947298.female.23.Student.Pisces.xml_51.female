Sucks for his wife, he cheats and its on someone who isn't even the same gender as her.  Cheating is cheating though, but his sexual orientation and well the fact he cheated on his wife has nothing to do with his position as governor. He came out and told the truth, a hard thing to admit when your a politician.  But if I was his wife I might be a little ticked off, and would hope he didn't bring any insects into the relationship. Eww stds.  		 And you know I was busy at work today when the last 20minutes was spent looking at this  slightly disturbing and funny site .  You tell the chicken to do things and it does them, it is a pretty cool program.  But the commercials are the disturbing parts.  		     especially this one.... but hey it's funny to. I feel a little violated on the inside.  But finally fast food directed towards adults.  Another advertising campaign I wish I came up with... damn it. I'll have to remember this trick....hmmm.    Personal:  Well sorta glad I'm not in Florida.  We live in Flagler and I just hope my family and sisters are safe when they go there.  I guess that's the risk you take during huricane season. But more on that later....    What's this quote from?  Don't talk of love but i've heard the word before It's sleeping in my memory I won't disturb the slumber of the feelings that have died If i never loved I never would have cried CeiN StarZ (2:06:34 PM): Don't talk of love but i've heard the word before It's sleeping in my memory I won't disturb the slumber of the feelings that have died If i never loved I never would have cried   I love you Sweet Leaf  When I first met you, didn't realize I can't forget you, for your surprise you introduced me, to my mind And left me wanting, you and your kind  I love you, Oh you know it  My life was empty, forever on a down Until you took me, showed me around My life is free now, my life is clear I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear  Come on now, try it out  Straight people don't know, what you're about They put you down and shut you out you gave to me a new belief and soon the world will love you sweet leaf  Black Sabbath
