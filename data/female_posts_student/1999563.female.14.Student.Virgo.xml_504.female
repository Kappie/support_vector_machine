It was kinda creepy...they were really scary! One girl was like "I hate everyone who wears pink" I was like "Wow.." scary...   My dad just got back from Indiana. The poor guy. He was supposed to be back at 1 PM but they had a huge thunderstorm so he didn't get to come home until 10 hours after he was supposed to!  sad times!  BUT I AM SO HAPPY.  I can't wait for San Diego!
