Creation : the act of creating; especially, the act of bringing the world into ordered existence.    The Theory of Evolution Vs. The Theory of Creation   I would like to state, before I continue, that I in no way support either evolutionism or creationism. I am impartial--well, no, fact is that I just  don't care --to both views, and I am only representing the facts which I know.    Evolution Vs. Creation    When it comes to the creation of man, there are two basic standpoints: the  evolutionists  and the  creationists  (I don't know if these are the correct terms, but bear with me).  The evolutionists believe that humans are evolved from primates, and that the human race will continue to evolve and adapt to the world (as we humans make it less liveable and more dangerous to ourselves).  The creationists believe that God created humans as humans, as he created Adam and Eve. Creationists believe that there is nothing before and nothing after being the way we are, and that we may adapt but never evolve.    S o, now we come to the Gan branch of this argument.   The Theory of Evolution of Gan Vs. The Theory of Creation of Gan    Yes, I took the term  Gan , as I use it, from Stephen King's  The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah . The Gan, in King's said novel, is used to indicate the creative overforce. So, by "the theory of evolution of Gan", I mean the theory of creativity evolving over time.    Evolution Vs. Creation of Gan    Now, take the evolutionists and the creationists, and apply those standpoints to the said creative overforce: to writers, artists, musicians, and others who rely on Gan for inspiration and aid.   Evolution : It is said that talents have to be learned, practiced, and honed to really be time-worthy. So the Theory of Evolution of Gan would be that if you do not practice practice practice, your spark and interest will go to waste and you will not be talented in whatever creative field you wish to pursue. (This theory does not, however, include improving upon the talent, because improvement is a normal progression which entails that one has the talent already.)   Creation : I'm sure once in your life, whether talking to a friend or relative, or listening to strangers' conversations, you have heard someone say "I can't help it, I was born this way." I am also sure that you, yourself have said this once or twice to explain your own actions. Can this be said of talents, as well? That some (if not most or even all) of us are born apt to a certain skill or talent at which, as soon as we have experimented with it, we have an uncanny amount of skill? (This, you may say, could be what is called "beginner's luck.")    A Neverending Argument    The tug-o'-war between evolutionists and creationists will go on forever, as long as humans cannot develop technology sophisticated enough to determine the true origins of  homo sapiens . The debate is still hot and rekindles easily when poked, and has been one of society's Great Debates since Charles Darwin published his controversial study   urlLink The Origin of Species   in 1859.
