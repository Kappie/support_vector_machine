What a wonderful comfort it would be to know where he is sometimes. It sounds dumb, but... Especially when I'm sick, and have nothing better to do, I often wonder where he is, or how he's feeling. Or I imagine he's curled up next to me.  It's sounds slightly creepy. And a bit past slightly.   Anyway. I'm going to go before I go crazy on this thing. Sleepy Sage needs to go  Sage
