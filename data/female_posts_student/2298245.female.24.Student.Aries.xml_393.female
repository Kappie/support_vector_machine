I think I like it better, though I may still play around with the font size a little bit.  I'm glad I've changed it, but I don't think it'll be happening again any time soon - judging from the headache I have - so hope everyone is happy with the new look.  This would all be a lot better if I had a slightly-more-than-rudimentary understanding of HTML.  Sigh.  I guess I'll have to add it to the list of things I need to learn.
