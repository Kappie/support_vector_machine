Still not working and the boss at the place i was going to work said that she will call me next week. What is up that? I am getting pissed with all th crap i am getting here. Some places say they need people but then they don't call me. Man i hate Edmundston people. I have to get back to the big city before i go crazy.  I am moving again to Fredericton New Brunswick in two months. I am moving in with Brandi and Brenda which will be great. I can't wait to move. I think my parents don't want me to move again. Mom's said  "Well this time she will not be so far away!"  I will be about 3 hours from Edmundston. My mom tells me she understands why i don't like Edmundston. Its so small and there is nothing here which pisses me off. I need to be in Fredericton where its nice and big.   Brenda was telling me about the amazing Firework show they had for Canada day. I wish i was there to see it. Fredericton is bigger then Brockville and so they had more fireworks then Brockville would have. Sometimes i wished i stayed in Brockville but i wouldn't have more money then i do now.   A funny thing happened yesterday. I was playing with my mom's dog and he bit my nose. It still hurts today. The little bugger. Anyways i have to get going. Still have stuff to do before i go. Have a good week!
