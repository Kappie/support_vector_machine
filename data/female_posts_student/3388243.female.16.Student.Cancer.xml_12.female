Saw Spiderman 2 while I was there and thought I should comment on it. As I didn't think the first one lived up to the expectations that was set up by the media I was a bit dubious about this one. Althought my fears were thrown away after watchin the first half the film. The action is fab and the story line is also very good. Kirsten Dunst puts on a fab performance like always and Tobey Maguire is great playing Peter Parker and has improved in his role. The only bad thing about the filmI have to say is the end. We all know that it has the romance story linked in with MJ and Parker but this is concentrated on at the end and I felt like this made the end very very cheesy! Some of the lines are really bad!   Anyways better go....i'll start boring you. lol
