I am going to figure out how to work the chat room and that should be working correctly soon too.  We took Billy and signed him up for PeeWee football last night. They only did drills so far. His team name is Southside Jaguars. He had a blast at practice last night. He can't wait to go back again. He will have practice 4 times a week until school starts then it will be 3 times a week. And every Sat. morning he has a game starting Sept. 4th. I will post some pictures on the web site as soon as i can. Love you all. Bye for now.
