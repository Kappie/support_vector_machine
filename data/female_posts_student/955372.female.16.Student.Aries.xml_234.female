I feel so happy and angry ,  nobody understands my feline , purple pain ,  I want to fly and run in the rain  the tree reminds me of feeling angry , the squirrels mock my enthusiasm ,   sometimes i want to stab my foot and die,  underneath the tall , small sky    make your own bad poem @  urlLink mewing.net">mewing.net
