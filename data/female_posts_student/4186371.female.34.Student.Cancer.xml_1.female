For instance, on my way home from schoo l  today (a 15-minut e  drive) I  s aw 3 vehicles at 3 differen t  time s  try to ch a nge  l anes without  l ooking  fir s t   a nd 3 times there was almost an accident right in front of me.  Another time for a couple of weeks I kept seeing tailgators.  And for about a week back in Jul y  I kept gett i ng s t uck behind  t he sl o w cars (they were  g oing 5, 10, 15 mil e s below  the  speed limit).  Why can't these people just go the speed limit, that's what it's posted on the side of the  r oad for.  Did I mention that in  on e of my pet peeves?  I can't remember.  If not, that is definite ly  one of them.  And  st ill another time I saw a rash of cars r u nning red lights.  Bad driving seems to go in cycles.  Maybe I don't drive enough or maybe I'm a magnet, whatever the case it drives me  batty .            Oh s p eaking of runn i ng re d  lights, I saw a county transit bus go through a red light.  Now I understand it can be hard to sto p  thos e  huge buses s o  they will go through a red light from time to time.  But this bus was already sitting at the red light and it hadn't changed yet before he started going through.  He was almost all the way through before the light did change.  What was he thinking?  Actually, that's  p robab l y what the probl e m was... he w a sn't thinking.          I have a f r i e nd who did this very same thing a b out a month ago.  She went th r ough a r e d light thinking it had turn ed  green, only to real i ze halfway through the i n tersection that it was still red and there was a police car behind her.  She ended up not gettin g  a ticket though, only a warning, which was fortunate.  But I laughed so hard when she was telling me this story, especially since the reason she was so distracted was because of a guy.  Guess we've all been there.  I know I've found myself more than once slowing down to stop at a green light because I was deep in thought about different things.          Anyway, I have to get going, I have some scrapbook pages to get finished.
