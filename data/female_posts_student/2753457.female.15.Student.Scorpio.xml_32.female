It seems like it is deeply involved in every aspect of my life.  I'm just permenantly dazed nowadays.  Hmmm, maybe it's just Sunday morning and I'm in a weird mood.  The Death Cab for Cutie album that I put on must just be helping me embrace my weird mood, and the Sundayness of it all.  This morning when I logged onto AIM, there were only about 10 people online, and it really made me sad for some reason. I guess I had a good weekend, social and anti-social in its own ways.  On Friday, I went home with Mary Alice after school and her mom took us to School Kids and to get Chinese food.  Then we went straight to Philip's surprise party.  That was one of the longest days of my life.  Yesterday during the day I did absolutely nothing.  I watched crap on tv, and then I went outside for a couple of hours.  The most productive thing I did was clean myself up and pick out an outfit for the party, which for me takes forever.  Charlie put on a good party.  I didn't know some of the people there, but that didn't stop me from hanging around the exact same people I always hang around with.  I thought it was fun.  And I was proud that I got a good present and made a good card.  I don't always care enough to do that, especially if I think I can get away with getting a not good present. Mary is coming home today for her Spring Break!  I'm excited; I have missed that kid.  When is our Spring Break? I wish it was yesterday again.  Then I'd be able to do nothing all day and then get to see everyone at night.  At least I don't have that much work to do.  We're kind of between projects in C and C right now.  I want the trial project to come back right now.  I loved that.  We need to at least keep the prosecution class. I should go get dressed.  I think my dad wants to take me out for breakfast.  I need to be a little more patient with my parents; they think I hate them, and I really don't.  I just need space right now.  I hope my Sunday morning mood doesn't jump out and bite my dad.
