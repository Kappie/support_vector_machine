I do need to work on my sources for my thesis though.  If I can get 10 sources before Monday, I can read Newsweek all of the class.  Wow, that's really dorky LOL.  Oh well my thesis is really cool.  I'm going to teach all you control freaks, bossy people, evil geniuses, oppressed children who wish to revenge themselves on their tormenters, and bullies how to rule the world as expressed in  1984 .   I got today's Quizilla from Shaheen.  She has a blog too.  Here's hers: http://www.winkalink.blogspot.com.  Anyway, here's today results:   urlLink     What Finding Nemo Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Yay I'm the main character!  I have yet to watch it from beginning to end tho.  Maybe if we don't go to the movies we can rent it or something.   Well I really should find at least five sources today, so I need to get workin on four.  Later.
