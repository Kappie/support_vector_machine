This is a part of the book in which really made me think    "The life of the heart is a place of great mistery. Yet we have many expressions to help us express this flame of the human soul. We describe a person without compassion as "heartless" and we urge him or her to "have a heart". Our despest hurts we call "heartaches" Page 3     "In the end, it doesn't matter how well we have performed or what we have accomplished -a life without heart is not worth living." Page 3   That just made me think a little about my heart and my life. God Bless and have a great day!
