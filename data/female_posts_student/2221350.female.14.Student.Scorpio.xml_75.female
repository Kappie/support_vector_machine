Saturday Devon wasn't here, so I was extremely happy all day and I just piddled around. Saturday night that stupid little fucker came home, but luckily I didn't have to be around her much because I went to play bingo with my mom and my neighbor.  bingo is SO much fun! I didn't win, but maybe next time?   today has been... Okay. I woke up really early for some reason and sat on the couch and listened to it rain. My mom made shrimp salad sandwitches for lunch! Devon was supposed to have done all this stuff but she didn't so she got yelled at. So mom is still pissed off at Devon and Devon is still a little cluckfucker and I want to chop her into little pieces. She's particularly perturbed at me because she's regretting that little deal we made. Apparently dish duty doesn't suit her. So she's in a crappier mood than usual and so she's cleaning our room and she's throwing all my stuff in the hallway. It's really pissing me off and every time I go near her she's like "fuck you caitlin" and I'm really tired of it. I wish with all my heart that murder was legal.   I met a really cool guy playing pool. His name's Michael and he's a starving artist. You guys should go listen to some of his music.  urlLink  MyDreamRewrite    testing starts tomorrow. I need to remember to pack my cards, poker stash, books, CD player, and food. God, I hate it. I almost hate it more than Devon, but not quite.   1. My favorite feature on myself is my hair, eyebrows... Well pretty much my whole head. But anything from the neck down is ugliness. 2. I'm a traffic whore, I have like.. 5 counter things attached to my blog. 3. I hate it when people find out I skipped grades and act stupid about it and then wonder if they can talk to me without explaining stuff. Of course they can, how do they think I GOT to 10th grade?? 4. My favorite flower is a morning glory. 5. When I was younger, I loved making lists of everything. I recently found an  inventory of all my clothes from when I was 11. 6. These days, I don't write anything down unless it's really important, and if it is, then it gets written on my hand. 7. The only thing I lose all the time are guitar picks, and then I have to buy more and then I find them in weird places like in the dishwasher.  right now I have written on my hand: my gym locker combination, 3 assignments, a reminder about a quiz on the 21st, and a phone number I don't recognize.  spring break is only two weeks away. My uncle, aunt and two cousins are coming in from Ohio. I can't say as I am extremely happy about this. Even though I love them all, my cousins are terrible. I think they are 1 and 3, and the 3 year old is a freaking holy terror. To make matters worse, fucker((aka my sister)) will be on an art trip and I'll be babysitting the whole time.  in case I haven't mentioned it, I hate kids. I don't want to have kids, I don't want to be around kids, and I don't want to think about kids. The only time I will tolerate kids is when I babysit, but then again I'll do almost anything for money. I find drooling, snotty, whining, stupid, annoying, cranky and always hungry outweighs the occasional cuteness that comes with being around kids.   I'll be posting bunches this week since I won't have homework!
