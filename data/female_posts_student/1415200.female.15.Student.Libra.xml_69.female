I had plenty of people that I hung out with, I had very good grades, hell, I even made it on the honor roll with a 3.9 gpa. I ran in track, and each time I ran, I got better. What could be better? Honestly. But now, I don't know. I hate where I live, the people I've hung out with don't want to hang out with me, nor talk to me. My grades in some of my classes are starting to slip because I've been doing so much, I haven't the time to study and do all my homework. It seems as though all that has ment anything to me, is just slipping away. And, of coarse it had to happen right before summer vacation. Why?. This always happens. Can't I be happy? For more than a 8 or 9 month amount of time? Seriously.  I just don't know anymore. I don't know anything.  I need to go listen to more of The Early November. Then, I need to go to sleep, where I don't realize how shizzy things have gotten. .. Way away, away from here I'll be....
