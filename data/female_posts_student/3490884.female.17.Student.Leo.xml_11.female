I've been thinking about how commomplace and predictable everything is until something unexpected, and usually bad, occurs to rattle my set foundation. And I've been wondering.  Wondering "what if" never does any good, but I can't help but wonder about the state of certain things. Some things are just so ordinary and regimented that they don't seem natural, and if they're not natural, then what is? Am I supposed to lead this life? I mean, there's nothing particulary wrong with it. It just seems so safe, secure, and set--and don't get me wrong, those are good things I'm lucky to have--but it seems so overly safe and secure that it's just freakish. Something is off, but I'm not sure what.  I'm okay with everything, but my life's so set that it can be overly tedious at times--well a lot of times. Everyone who knows me knows I love a good fairy tale with a happy ending, so it's only fitting that I refer to a Disney cartoon. In Beauty and the Beast, Belle sang, "There must be more than this provincial life."   I'm not unhappy, but I admit I'm bored. I'm not looking for drama. I'm just looking for some sort of change. This stagnation equals irritation. Nothing happens that's not planned for (with the exception of one sad loss recently). But generally speaking, my life goes on with the same schedule every day.   I'm bored and I don't think that's wrong. It's fine. I'm happy and appreciative of what I have, but I'd like some variety--that doesn't have to be sad--once in a while. I'm not looking for a fairy tale happy ending existence. I'm just looking for more than the normal set of events.   Then in thinking about that, I wonder again. Is my life the way it is because of me? Well, Sartre would say that it's a result of my choices that my life is what it is. I guess I'd have to say I agree, but then, can't I now make choices to cause some variety?   I'm not the type of person who enjoys not knowing what's going to come, but I don't like the other extreme either. Life is the other extreme for me. I'm not complaining, but I don't see any harm in shaking things up a bit. I want to see what happens and if it's wrong to be curious, I don't want to be right.   So did I make a choice that set me into this scheduled life? Yes. But what was it? What if I hadn't ever gotten involved in orchestra? What if I hadn't ever taken advanced classes or won awards? What if I hadn't been so focused on academics? What if I didn't live in a small town my whole life? Would I have come across adventure in my life? I think yes.   But I'm happy with the choices I've made. So I guess, I'll have to be contented with my life as it is because it probably is my fault. I probably missed opportunities for romance, action, and adventure. Oh well. I'm happy with the way things are, but I'd love it if I could get some variety once in a while.   So yeah. An entry of questions without real answers. Wow, the English research paper clearly affected me...thanks again Sartre.
