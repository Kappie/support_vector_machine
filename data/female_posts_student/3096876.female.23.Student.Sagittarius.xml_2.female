Yeah, and actually being there was no easier.  Aside from all the standard gay-guys filling the aisles, there was also an abundance of couples milling around (yes, even for a Monday night it was packed at IKEA) and it got me feeling really nostalgic.  These couples are doing the same thing that Brent and I would normally be doing at IKEA: looking at the merchandise, shaping our lives around our furniture.  How Palahniuk.  But depressing... like Palahniuk... hmm.  I got some lamps, some organizational stuff, some pictures frames, and I went home and lit, organized, and decorated my room.  It's nice and bright now, maybe I need some dimmer bulbs, and everything's got its place.  I put half a dozen of my favorite pics into frames... so what if three of them had Brent in them?  Whatev.  Mom was telling me just the other day, there's nothing wrong with what I'm doing, but I need to be careful not to burn myself out.  I can keep busy,  but I need to make sure I'm staying rested too...  yeah, sleep is sooo easy lately.  Ky has convinced me that the best thing for everyone concerned is a night of drunken debauchery this Saturday.  We're going to go to the Madison, traditionally, quite the hotspot for fights (!), of course there's no Brent now to contend with.  We'll see how this goes, and hopefully I can find the impetus to actually write about it afterwards.
