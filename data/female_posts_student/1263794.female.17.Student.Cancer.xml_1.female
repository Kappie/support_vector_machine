(not that anyone is going to read this, but I guess you never know ) Well anyways, all those blogs out there have really inspired me to start one of my own. Some of them are actually quite good and kind of make me hope that no one will read mine, but I guess you don't know how good of a writer you are until you start writing. Alright well I'm still not exactly sure how this works so I'm gonna enter this much and see what happens.  Well I think I figured everything out. This whole thing is actually pretty cool. An online jounral I guess.You know I've always wanted to keep a journal, and I used to try really hard but I could never keep it up for more then a couple weeks. I never really had anything interesting to talk about when I was little anyways, so none of my entries were very interesting. Plus I used to have to force myself to sit down and write because I hated writing, and I think you really want to have to want to write to write something worth reading. Dr.Busonik always tells us to write what we feel or something like that, and lately I've been enjoying writing. His class is really starting to shape up. Typing is also a hell of a lot easier than writing stuff down on paper, so maybe I'll be able to keep these entries continuous. And reading back over this entry I can see I still don't have anyting interesting to talk about at the moment. Maybe tomorrow.
