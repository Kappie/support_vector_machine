Plus all the homework you recieve. I have about piles of homework to complete, but i'm not going to do it, well not all of it. Also people around this time of year seem to get bitchy and annoying. OH WELL SCHOOL IS ALMOST OUT.  Yesturday the funniest thing happend. In science my fag of a teachers button was undone. It was so sick. his white fat hanging out of it. it was sick, but funny at the same time. He didnt know his button was undone, but the whole class did and there was alot of laughter. Then science became boring and I feel asleep.  Lately it seems i have pissing or annoying one person or another. Anything i do makes on person mad or annoyed with me. Maybe because i complain and take things to seriousily. Or maybe because i get annoyed and mad at a person easily. School has become a huge war zone i must say. Everyone is warping against eachother. Everyone is talking about you behind your back. Its like were living in some far insane planet. A planet of freaks, bitches, and annoying people. Haha. I think it may at the end of the school year disease. Hmm... Ponder that.  So my sister is sick, and she believes that she can continue to boss people around. But you see boss them around more then usual. Then if someone usually me doesnt do something for her she becomes an evil bitch. But you see i happy for the fact that my younger brother is leaving this house for the whole weekend. How sweet is that. Completely no annoyance from him. Praise the Lord. Haha.  On friday im going to buy the new issue of AP, and this book called The Book Of Suicide Bunnies. Haha. Its about bunnies who try different ways to vanish themselves. Its like a comic type book... it will be funny i think. But anyways. i dont feel like typing anymore.   Also if you sat there and read this whole thing or the other long posts that i have wrote i am proud of you. i dont think that someone acutally would... haha.   Hannah
