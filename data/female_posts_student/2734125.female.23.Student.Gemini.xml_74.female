Instead its cramped.  I am listening to a new CD though- Nellie McKay.  She's really cool.  Mostly I just want to sit here and listen to her, not write multiple papers in a crunched time frame.  I will certainly need to plan better as far as that goes next year.  I cant write here.  Damn it.  I'm just staring at the screen.  I wanted to write last night, but I no longer have internet at my house, so I cleaned my room last night instead.  Maybe I will go over to eddy... Its bound to by quiet, if the labs even open...
