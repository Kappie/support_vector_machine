I just changed back into a pair of pajamas.   This is weird. My fingers are like numb. It's actually sort of difficult for me to type. I guess I shouldn't be typing anyway. I should be cleaning. I need to finish up my room so I can go out tomorrow. I'm not sure what I even want to do tomorrow. I kind of want to hang out with Chris since I haven't hung out with him in a while. Or Nikki, Kathryn, Kelly, and Mary Clare since I haven't hung out with them in a while either. And I..obviously want to hang out with Bryan, but yeah. Who knows? Maybe I'll end up doing nothing but going to church.   I'm listening to October right now. It sort of makes me sad since this is the song I always listen to when soomething really crappy happens or when I'm in an awful mood.   But things have been so good lately. I mean, last week was amazing. Or, Monday and Tuesday were at least. I don't know. I stll kind of can't get over it. I thought he might have, but hearing him say it was so different and surprising for some reason. I guess it just feels really nice to have someone like me for me, and someone who I really like as well and can be myself around. Like...I don't feel stupid around him. I feel completely relaxed and comfortable.   I'm just really happy with the way things are going right now...at least in that area.   Next weekend I'm going to Michigan! :) YaY! I'm really excited to see everyone. Lauren, Max, Sara...it should be really really nice. I've been talking to Lauren so much more lately too. Ever since this summer, we talk a lot more. I'm not sure why,   And yay! Chris just called me. It was nice talking to him. :) Haha...it was also fun talking to him and Bryan last night. That was très funny.   Anyway I'm going to go finish up my cleaning! I swear I am! :) Maybe...
