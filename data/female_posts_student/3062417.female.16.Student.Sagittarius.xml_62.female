So now after being bombarded with questions from my dad about driving, prom, school, and of course Gavin, I can actually relax and not be defensive about everything I say.  Tomorrow- I think I'm going to the mall with my mom so I can buy a white shirt for majors fest on Friday. I can't wait for that. I get to miss school and hang out w/ some of my very awesome friends and just have fun (well then there's the playing part).  Listening to: [Rise Against: Like The Angel]
