Then when BM period,Kid Yie and Farha presented the 'Bahasa'.At first,I and Taufiq busy discussing.Then Nazalea,Lek Wen and Arvind also gave their opinions.it sounds liked debate and it's very fun.   When Moral period,I had played truth and dare with some friends.It's kinda of fun.Encik Lim also started to recite his life experience.hehe...Then I today only know that Emma didn't believe in spirits.   Today got little rain.....but still a good day ^-^
