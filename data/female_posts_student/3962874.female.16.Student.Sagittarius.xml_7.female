He was in the eighth grade and a lot of the girls thought he was pretty cute, including my friend Kyla. I wasn't very interested because I only liked boys if they said they liked me and even still I was a shy girl and boys were just not for me. Soon enough word was around that the boy, also known as Sam, liked Kyla. Kyla is a really tiny, cute girl who is very outgoing. She is popular and a lot of guys like her. By the beginning of summer Sam and Kyla were dating. Of course Kyla and I were good friends (since 1st grade) but Sam lived a block from my house. She practically lived at my house over the summer (this usually happened because my dad owns a nice big house on a lake). Every night we would go over to Sam's house to either watch a movie or have a bon-fire. Even the nights when we weren't allowed to go out, or the nights when we had a curfew, we would be out with Sam. The two of them would make-out in the bushes.One time Sam brought a friend to his house and I ended up liking him a little. Me and him made out in some grass and he was the first boy I ever kissed. (I was embarrassed to tell him though soI told him I made outwith some other bad boy in the fifth grade. I was COOL!)Everyone thoughtSam and Kylawere perfect for each other. They dated for about a year until Kyla decided that she wanted to date someone in her grade who was popular like her. My brother is the same age as Sam so of course they were friends and even after Kyla and Sam broke up Sam continued to come over to my house. I have no idea how it happened but somehow Sam and I became very close. I was in seventh grade and Sam was a freshman in high school. He got a car and so he would drive around the island every night. Sometimes with his guy friends and sometimes with just me. When it was just us, we would go park somewhere and make out in his car listening to music like Lenny Kravitz. Kyla didn't care at all. Now she was just learning to drive so Sam would let her drive his car around all night and we would get in the backseat and make out. I never did anything more then that until July after seventh grade. We had been "together" for something like six months, i dont really know for sure.We didn't call each other boyfriend and girlfriend, but I had feelings for him and I thought he had feelings for me. On thefifth of July, I snuck out of me and my friends tent and went to Sams house. We made out for likefour hours and... I touched his weewee. We didn't do anything more but that was the worst thing I had done with a guy and my other friends hadn't done that yet so I was very ecstatic. Things continued like this for another year or so. We would drive around and make out and things. It got to the point where I would let him feel me up. It was a big deal to me. I really liked him and he was my first boyfriend. But we still weren't officially going out. So I told him that I wanted to sometime around July after eighth grade. We started "going out" and a week later (the fourth of July to be exact), Sam got mad at me for not saying hi to him at the beach. We still disagree to this day on whether or not I said hi to him or not. I did say hi to him but I wasn't all over him like normal because his cousin had a friend over who was his age and I didn't like her. I could tell she liked Sam so I wasn't in a very good mood.I found out later that week after he broke up with me that he had made out with that other girl. That was the first time that I got my heard broken. He acted like he did nothing wrong and talked to everyone like nothing had ever happened between me and him. I was furious. And by the end of that summer I had made out with tons of other guys. The school year started and I was in high school. I flirted a lot. I guess you could call it my expirimental stage because within a few months, I had made out with most of the guys I knew, let them touch me all over, drank, and even smoked. I wasn't hanging out with very good people. I had a drinking problem (enough to drink alone. but not too many people knew about it). In November I met a guy (who was actually dating one of my old friends). His name was Daniel, he liked to be called Dan but I dare to be different. He ended up coming over to my house and not a week later we were dating. I didn't like him as much as I wish I had (I still had feelings for Sam)but he said he was totally in love with me, and I figured "Why not? You can always dump him" We started going out on November 27th of 2002. It has been 19 months so far and we are doing pretty good. He's grown on me and I love him! I quit doing all those bad things because of him. I lost my virginity to him. Meanwhile Kyla started dating Sam again. Me and her hadn't talked in a while when I found out because of my whole self discovery/experimental stage. So when I found out, I made fun of her. I think, deep down I was jelous. I don't know why, maybe because I couldn't see Sam with any other girl. But there they were again. Anyway, they dated forsomething close to a year i think and then Kyla met another guy. She broke up with Sam and he was heart broken. I think he was really in love with her because she is all he ever talked about. Anyway, Daniel and I have only gonethrough one major problem... and it was my fault. About five weeks ago we started getting in a whole bunch of fights. I was convinced that we couldn't be happy together and that we weren't meant to be together. This was after Sam and Kyla broke up, I thought I had feelings for Sam again. I had a few classes with him and I guess you could say he flirted with me once and a while. He told me that I was a great person. I told Daniel that I thought I liked Sam and he didn't believe me. I was very confused and depressed. The night after Sam, my brother and some freinds graduated they decided to go down to this beach. I was invited and so I went, without Daniel. Sam's cousin, she's about my age, was there too and so me and her were like buddy buddy while the guys built a fire and whatnot. Sam sat next to me and we could both just feel that the other one of us had some kind of feelings. Nothing happened until we all went back to Sam's for some movies. I layed on one of his smaller couches and he ended up laying next to me. He held my hands, and kissed them. I really thought there was something there. (Oh yeah I forgot to mention that Daniel and Sam were and still are pretty good friends) Sam knew we weren't doing very well and he told me that I didn't have to do anything that I didn't want to do. But for some reason I did it anyway. I kissed him and soon enough we were making out. I was really tired so I don't really remember all the details exactly, but I do remember Sam kept saying that I was a really great person and that I am so nice and happy and cheerful. Mostly that I am really great. The more he said it the more I thought... "you really don't like me. if you did you would say it. not that i am a great person. and if i was a great person, i never would have done this to daniel." i fucked up. I told Daniel the next day. He was angry for a while but I guess I am worth forgiving. I hate myself more than anything for doing it. And I know for a fact that I will never do it again. A lot of people would think that I was a slut if they knew, but I am not that kind of person. Truthfully, I cry every time I think about it. Writing this I cry and reading it I’ll cry. Daniel has forgiven me and right now we are really happy. People make mistakes. Mine was just a little bit bigger than everyone elses. Lately, I guess Sam has been after a lot of girls. BJ here, makeout there. It seems like he likes a new girl every week. It just pisses me off that I had to be one of them. I know he still has feelings for Kyla, he just can't get over her.As for me, I think she still has feelings for him too.Daniel, I really don’t know how to describe him. He makes me happy. I'm in love wth him andI really wouldn’t be surprised if we ended up getting married. Not that I wanna make the promise or anything.
