Igor, he was in yr 10, a fucken hot exchange student from France for 2 years. As all girls know the French are the best kisses. But there was more too it than that Igor was great. He told me that he would come back in a year and get me if I still liked him then. I dated him for 5 months in total, during my 4th month I realised that one of my friends, Leanne, liked him and she wanted to date him but didn’t say anything about it to me because she knew I liked him also at that stage. If she had told me I wouldn’t have dated him to start off wit no matter how much I liked Igor I neva choose "dicks ova friends" (Jackie’s words). Igor was my first kiss, I know that’s sad because it was only 2 years ago, but still. everyone says first kisses are always special but when I had mine I was just freaked out cause I really didn’t know what to do. he came ova and asks my parents permission to take me to village cinemas. I thought he was so cute to come to my parents and ask. that’s the type of person he is though, we dated during valentines day and so he left a rose wit a note on my doorstep. he did things like that just to make me feel special it was so cute. as soon as I found out my Leanne liked him it was all downhill from there though, I just didn’t feel the same about him. it felt wrong because Leanne doesn’t get the chance to go out wit people from the same country very much. (she usually dates people from Canada.) and probably the only chance she could get wit a guy she liked and I took it away from her. I feel bad for not really giving Igor a reason for breaking up wit him. I just gave him the reason, "its not u it’s me, I have changed and didn’t feel the same about him as I did 5 months ago". it felt bad but I knew it was for the best. while we were dating Leanne acted differently but I just thought that was because Igor was around me a lot and I didn’t go anywhere without him following, I neva really love him though... after me and Igor broke up Leanne didn’t talk to me for a whole year. it was just freaky because I wasn’t sure if it was because of Igor or not. I still think its childish just ignoring someone just because ur pissed off at them but still I understand y she would be upset. when I first came to college she was my closest friend. she went out of her way to make sure I felt comfortable, and while we weren’t talking for a year she still sent me notes saying how she introduced me to everyone and into her friends group (now my friends group more than hers though). even now 2 years later she tries to use that against me. Yeah she helped me out once and for that I thank her but its fucken 2 years later how much is she gonna dwell in the past for?
