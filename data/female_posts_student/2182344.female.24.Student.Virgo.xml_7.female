When I suggest going out for dinner, he says something like, "we go out too much.  We should stay in and save money."    Class was shitty today.  We had a group project.  My group consists of myself, and three other people.  One person is foriegn (from Yugoslavia), and she's very nice, tries to understand everything, but has trouble sometimes, I think because of the language used in statistics.  Another person in the group sits there and complains the entire time about how much she wants to finish so that we can leave (when we're through with the project, we can go).  She drove me crazy today!  She said that she's going to NYC this weekend, so I understand her being excited and anxious, but come on!  Shut the hell up, and we might be able to get this thing done!  As we were answering the last two questions, she was talking to someone on her cell phone.  I guess she had done her part.  She was complaining about how much she hated school.  I guess that she doesn't realize that college is optional.   Anyways, enough of my ranting.    What do I have planned for this weekend?  Let's see:  Friday:  Harry Connick Jr. concert.  Very much looking forward to that.  I need to wash my jeans so that I can wear them to the show.    Saturday:  There's an auction in Cynthiana at a woman's house, who I believe was my great aunt.  Not sure on the specifics.  But, a couple of weeks ago, I discovered a love of auctions.  Hopefully she'll have lots of good stuff.  The rest of the day, I'm sure, will be spent in Cyn. with my family.  Sunday:  Spend day with Robert.  I'm not sure what we're going to do.  We haven't made any plans.    Then it's back to school.  Next week should be my last in my stats class.  After that I have to make it through six weeks of college algebra.  Ugh!!    I need to figure out how to post pics on here.  It would be nice to post them so that family and friends could see them too.    That's all for now.  I guess I'm not in the writing mood.  Maybe later.
