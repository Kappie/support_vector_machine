When would you expect that such a person would be awake and functioning? Say...7, right? 9, maybe? TRY 1 OR TWO....IN THE EVENING. So you should have seen the stupefied look on my face as the phone rang at 9 and 1/2 this morning, and I was sleeping there, thinking to myself..."That's the phone, isn't it? Man, I don't care. I'll pick it up if it's still ringing in a few hours." But then rationality crept in and, tripping over every available tripper in the house. I managed to get to the phone as it stopped ringing. I hate cellphones.  Abby would know this, as well. Not only did my phone suffer a 30:32 last night, it also went out due to one lightning strike, and eventually died because the power being pumped into it by the PLUG IN THE WALL was not enough to sustain the dying battery for a phone call. So I just gave up and called the phone a suckhead and cried. Heheh. I get to beat up lots of people tho, in the next coming weeks. Life is shaping up to be a bundle of roses.  I've had one Wild Cherry (doesn't that count as a fruit?) Pepsi as of this morning, and as I sank back into a caffeine-depraved drowse last night, I could feel myself dying for the next morning so as to have one. These things are like cigs. I LOVE CAFFEINE. There's no animosity towards that stuff at all. I just love it. loveitloveitloveit   SIN CITY , BONUS!  God in heav'n, the BLog is repopulated, you must love me.
