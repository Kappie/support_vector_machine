But I know now what he thinks and feels about me. And that is to not have me in his life anymore. So that is his loss. And I am going to move on.  I think I've actually surprised him this morning because I came in and I am happy. I think that threw him a bit. hehe  I had the best swim workout yesterday! It was awesome! It was a ladder workout. There were a few times I felt that I was going to drown and I worked up quite the sweat. But I did it. It was amazing!!! 100 hard; 100 easy; 200 hard; 100 easy; 400 hard; 100 easy; 200 hard; 100 easy; 100 hard; 100 easy. 1500 in total!! So much fun! I was starving afterwards and tired but it was awesome.  I would like to find a group to ride with and then my training circle will be complete!
