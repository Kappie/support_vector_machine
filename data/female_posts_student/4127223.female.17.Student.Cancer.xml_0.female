So yesterday was like...nothing. i sat around, and tried to do algebra ratios for an hour. that was really productive. i got like two phone calls. dustin- wanting to do something, but called too late and it wasn't worth it. breanne- on ericks phone, wanting me to come to the wedding dance, but i said i wanted to sit at home, and i wouldn't even drive in there anyways like they wanted me to.      that made me think, does erick do shit behind my back?? like go out, and drink, and flirt w/ girls??? probably.       yep, so then i just sat at home. and today, me and brooke tanned. i talked to kara. and me and brooke went to town, got some pizza, bought me a belt and a new purse. its so cute, its cordorouy w/ stars printed w/ the cordorouy somehow and brown, and made by dickies. so its perfect for fall. i give it **** four stars!! lol. ...i think we went to town, just to go to town, woo. oh, and i bought like ALL the chocolate de vanilla chupa chups, and ALL the flan de vanilla chupa chups. YUM YUM. i'll probably eat them all today too.      but jeez, i hope i see erick today.... otherwise i feel like a waste of time gettin up and dressed.
