Well, I cannot say that i am well prepared but i also feel that i am pretty much done with the revision!! I think i shall give myself a treat by going for a movie!!  Anyway..the term break is starting and i shall be heading for the tanning studio since i do not think the sun here is quite good...imagine all the UV rays and those darn crowds..never the less..i shall be comitted into looking good...despite of the rising temperatures! I am currently reading the books 5 of the Gossipgirl Series!! It totally rocks my world...enjoyed it so much!! I am so happy that the next harry potter movie is coming out!! I am not exactly a avid fan of HP series but i find Daniel Radcliffe veryy cute!! And to say the truth, i quite like the story line!! I just don't understand why the misconception people have with the movie...afterall it is all about good defeating evil... I have been listening to some cds which includes...JET!! and of cause Maroon 5...Andy is just so handsome!!
