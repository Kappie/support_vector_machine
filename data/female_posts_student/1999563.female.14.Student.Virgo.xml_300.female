So, freddy and my brother myscheviously stole my heart (mandy, long story)  but did I tell you how much I love superchick?  Heatehr gets to see them tonight. I bet she is seeing them right this very second. The concert starts at 7 and its 6:24 so she is probably selling merch. I wanna be there!  Now I have to go to a dumb v-day dance becasue I am on ASB. Oh well. At least Sara is coming!!
