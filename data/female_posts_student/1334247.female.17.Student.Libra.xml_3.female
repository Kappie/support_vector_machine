Then, Matthew came over and we watched Joy Ride. Today the family went to eat at Applebees, I havent been there forever. It was good, I got to see my cousin Kristen, so that was even cooler. Now I'm home, trying to figure out what to do tonight. I think I'm going bowling with some people, but I dont know yet.   I really need to get a prom dress, and I have this one picked out that I'm dying to get, but the closest place it's available is in Des Moines, so maybe I'll see if I can go up and visit Micki and while I'm up there I can get that dress. It's very pretty, and very different from typical prom dresses (which is a plus).
