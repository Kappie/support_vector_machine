We leave on June 30 for West Virginia,  buttcrack of the world , to visit Dad's relatives there... they don't have computers, or internet, or cell-phone reception there.  I swear I'm going to die.  I just hope we avoid my Uncle John's shack on the river because he doesn't have anything in his shell of a house: no electricity, no real furniture, no bedroom/bathroom doors, no airconditioning, no telephone, no tv, no running water (except in the bathroom)... it's primitive, really.  The only good thing about driving up there is that I might get to swing over to Princeton, NJ and take a look at the campus and town.  We're staying through July 11 or 12th (which means I'm going to miss all my friends' July 4th parties) before turning around to come home.  I need to pack, but I don't want to.  I hate laundry and clothing.  I'd wear the same clothes every day this summer if it weren't for hygienic concerns.  I can only hope they'll let me bring my computer along for the ride.   Free AOL trial , here I come... heh.  Even without internet there's a lot of stuff I can do... I've been meaning to play around with  urlLink Mathematica  and  urlLink PARI  for a while now.  I'll be a lot more helpful in next spring on the interschool test if I can get some background with these programs.  Anyway, I still don't get to come home after my stay in WV.  They're dropping me off at my aunt's house near Atlanta, GA so I can catch my flight out of Atlanta International Airport to Dullus, which is near Washington D.C.  You see, mom thought it would be a great idea for me to attend the  urlLink Congressional Youth Leadership Council ... what a waste of 10 days.  I have to dress up all the time and be on my best behavior and talk about politics and such with other academic stars like myself.  Most people would think this quite an honor, but I take no pleasure in touring D.C. in heels or rubbing noses with other elites.  I'm content right here in my little room with my books and PC and calculator... and silence.   Call me an introvert , I guess.  I should be flying back to Atlanta by July 22, and probably home a few days later.  All in all, I count it as a month wasted.  I'll be home just in time to pick out my school supplies for the fall semester.  *sigh*
