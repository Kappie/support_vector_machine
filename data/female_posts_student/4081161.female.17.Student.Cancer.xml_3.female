I don't like remembering to take my vitamins because most of the time I can't.   Today was such a nice day. It was breezy enough, the sun was hardly peeking through the cloudly sky, and it was all around good. It was a nice day to go outside ... and then go back inside ... so you can say "wow, it's nice to go outside" but you never really do. That's what I did. I actually went OUT with Sunday. My sister took my cousin and me to the Florin Mall and the Romano Macaroni Grill.   Florin Mall shouldn't even be called a "mall." It should be called "The Building Where Ghetto Stores Congregate." Half the good stores were closed like Walton's Book Store, K B Toys, and whatnot. JC Penny is closed down, Nordstrom closed a loooong time ago. Sears is still there. We went to Foxnoor, Catwalk, and all the other junior clothing stores where I'm sure local strippers and prostitutes load up on the latest fashions. Arden is doubly better than Florin Mall. I'm not even sure what even holds Florin Mall up. Passed by Happiness Is .. and bought myself a CD wallet for 6.75.   Romano Grill has alright Italian food. Our food took an abnormally long time to arrive so our waiter (a very nice looking thirty-something guy named Vince) and the manager (a not so looking forty-something bald guy who had a terrible sense of humor) came over and apologized profusely for the wait. On all tables were crayons and a paper placemat so dinners could draw to entertain themselves. The waiter and the manger seemed to appreciate my artsy-fartsy interpretation of the olive oil bottle, the pepper shaker, and my glass of strawberry lemonade. Food came and we ate ourselves full. Somehow food tastes better then you're starving. While we were waiting for our dessert, we complimented all the nice-looking waiters and busboys. We teased each other for a good ten minutes about how cute they all were. Y'know, usual girl stuff.   Otherwise nothing else interesting. This post has been boring so far. I think I'll do that later. Right now I have to look at Homestar Runner before lightening strikes me dead.   = cristie
