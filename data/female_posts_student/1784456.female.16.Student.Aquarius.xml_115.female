Well I walked a bit with some people then they walked off and I overly avoided every one else (I was kind of trying to dum it into them that they're mean cause they are) well they probably are... Then I get home and phew Mango's ok. (He threw up yesterday and he had the runs and he wouldn't eat!) Poor ickle kitty! Then I flooped down here. Floop? I recon that should be added to the English language! Floop: commenly used by Katie. Real meaning: unknown. Yes that's right, I'm Katie not Kes (fooled you!) Hmm! Well guess I gotta research marijuana now! It's a hard life but some one has to do hw (not Izzy) Oh and on a moral ending: why is the world so confused? (Sorry about the short blog but some one (you know who) isn't posting any so this is a blog-strike on my behalf! So that means that Izzy will have to type something...doesn't it? (I think Blogger's going to my head!) Any one else notice how the top 10 blogs is in a continous loop? (Don't worry, this is number 11!) ;)
