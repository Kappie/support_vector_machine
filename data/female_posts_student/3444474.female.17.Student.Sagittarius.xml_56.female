I wanna go to Barnes and Noble today and buy a new Bible. Mine is really beat up, and I want to start reading it again. I read most of it in my Biblical Studies class, but there parts we skipped that I wanted to go through. I want my own nice copy. My mom's really nice copy, with the sliver page lining and the leather binding is hers, it was a gift, I can't take that. Besides, I want the little one that I can keep in my purse.   Cameron suggested that I read  Left Behind . We'd talked about it in class, but I had never read it myself. I want to watch the movie too. Hmm, maybe I'll pick that up too.   I have a small pile of books piling up that I wanna read before the end of the summer. I'm almost done with  Girlfriend 44 , this book I started reading about a year ago that I never finished. I picked it up right where I left off, and I still remember most of the story I had already read, which was good. I'm almost done with it now, just a few more chapters, and then I'm on to finishing  In the Bedroom .   I'll finish my Hitchikers trilogy last, since it has the most books in it (six all together).  *sigh* back to my iPod and my e-mails.
