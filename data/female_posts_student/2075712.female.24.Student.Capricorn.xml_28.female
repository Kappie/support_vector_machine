THANK GOD !!!  but....she does have many other health problems that we need to take care of.  1. She has a HUGE  urlLink ulcer  in her stomach. 2. It is internally bleeding. 3. She has lost so much blood that she is now  urlLink anemic . 4. She has 3 masses in her body, although they are not cancerous..I don't think they can be good for her. 5. And last but not least...she has  urlLink fluid in her lungs .  I do have to say that I am so absolutely thrilled that she does not have cancer!!! I am sooooooooooooooooooooo HaPpY !!!  I hope that she can get better! The doctors are giving her lots of meds and she is finally eating again!  Ok, that's all for now...going to go visit her!
