So I feel it's only fair that I return the favour with links back (with the added bonus that they are actually both definitely worth a read even if they HADN'T been nice to me):   Confessions of a Salivator   Anyhoo   And in case that weren't already enough to cheer me up, I also managed to buy a decent pair of jeans today; they fit, they look good and I didn't have to get a remortgage to pay for them. (Trust me, if you've ever tried to buy maternity clothes, you'll understand what an enormous achievement that really is.)  Can things get any better?
