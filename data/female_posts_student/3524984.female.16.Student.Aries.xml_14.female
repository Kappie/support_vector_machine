But, I can't cope with Jenn's death alone. I've been with her sister Julie for the last couple of days. Just sitting there and crying. She's 16, and had one sister and that sister is dead. I hate this. Why? Oh Why?! I wish I could know what she's feeling. I am feeling really really bad. Can I imagine her, all alone. For the rest of time. I Love You Jenn! We All Do! R.I.P  My computer breaks down in the middle of the week. I'm totally fucked then. I fixed it myself. I'm really good with computers. Well, I would like to think so. I used to suck at it. But computers were involved in my life at the age of 5! Ok, 11 years later, I'm a computer wiz. Yuck. I won't be fixing anyone's computer for awhile. I haven't left the house for over a week. I only left to go to the Funeral Home, The Funeral and when she was burried. This is too hard for me. I thought I would never say that. *sobs*  When I saw Jenn's boyfriend, the first thing he says to me was "I suppose this is the lowest of the low?" I just stood there, and nodded my head. Afraid that if I would cry, I wouldn't be able to control myself. Julie on the other hand was letting it all hang out. I think that they almost had to get her out of the Funeral Home once or twice. Jenn is already missed. More than I had imagined before. That morning I remember when my English teacher told me. I froze. And asked him if I could go home. He nodded, and said "Well, what do you want me to say Em?" I just burst out in tears. He just let me walk out like that. But I didn't go home. I walked around town until school was actually out. I walked for almost 5 hours. I didn't know where I was going until I passed by Jenn's house knocked at her door. Julie answered. And I just gave her the biggest hug. We stayed in the doorway at least 15minutes. We All Love You Julie!   I can't believe it. It was ALL OVER the fucking news! What!? They called Jenn a "Long-Time Drug Addict" What?! No No No! That's bullshit. Simply. I mean, how could they do that to her? Her family was so pissed off. {Julie, was the most.} At school, this girl said "She died! So what? She was good-for-nothinG! She'll rot in Hell" One of Jenn's cousins came up to the girl, slapped her, kicked her, and was screaming like nuts. I am proud of her! Way-to-Go! That girl deserves to die! (I sound like her! Icky!) Ok, no death wishes!  I wish I could write more...But I can't I am shaking like nuts. It's taking me hours to write this. And no one is reading. Oh, I should go continue my Novel. "Tales of the Disturbed" I have over twenty pages full. I think I might post some up here. But I'm not sure. It's bad. And all these ideas of death my ruin it all! ~S-em
