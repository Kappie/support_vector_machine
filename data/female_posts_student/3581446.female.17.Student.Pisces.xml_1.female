Yes, Anderson is just that funny.   *** Me: Y'know, I am sort of Eddish, myself Me: Sheltered geek with a facsination for Bebop and mostly around for comic relief Anderson: lol Me: Too bad the cosplay options for that would be relatively limited... Anderson: for Ed? Me: Oui Me: My being male, and all Anderson: i've only seen one Ed cosplay..  ev4r Me: Yeah Me: And my being '6"3, male, and portly in stature would preclude any attempt on my part, unless I was really drunk or just nuts Anderson: you've never seen "male Faye" have you Me: Oh. Dear. God. Me: Fear and Loathing on Mars. Anderson: http://www.angelfire.com/rock3/beboppin/pictures/manfaye.jpg Me: *clicks with an irrepressible feeling of intense fear in the pit of his stomach* Me: AGG! Me: UGHH!! Me: *convulsions* Me: *pain* Me: *wishes he were dead* Anderson: [ link censored for your protection ] Me: NOO! NO MORE!! Me: *convulsions* Anderdson:: [ link censored for your protection ] Me: ... Anderson: i'm evil Me: Very much so Me: I'm pretty sure I'm traumatized now Me: One more step towards the brink for me, of course  ***  Anderson: Dr4gon said: "Im getting a Bugatti16-4Veyron" Anderson: is that some kind of techno sausage Anderson: ? Me: LOL Me: What in the hell is a Techno Sausage? Me: ...Or do I want to know?  ***  Me: Your friends are almost as nutty as mine Anderson: my friends advertise me as the nutty one Anderson: and everyone agrees Anderson: usually i see myself as the least nutty of them all Me: I would agree Me: Though you are a nut (as am I) Anderson: i never said i was sane.  i just don't see myself as "The" nut Me: Oh Me: I see Anderson: like how Frank is "The" cynic.  Brad is "The" Donatello. Anderson: Tyler is "The" newbie Me: ... Me: I have no idea what that means Anderson: ok Me: But I getcha, all the same Me: Who is 'the' nut, IYO? Anderson: we don't have a "The" nut, really. Anderson: everyone in our group can be equally pathetic at the right moments Me: You know how the old poker saying goes Me: If you can't spot the rube at the table, you're it.  Anderson: *makes Spike's "WTF, Jet?" face* daemon1337: lol Anderson: i'm not a nut Anderson: err Anderson: "The" nut Me: D'nile ain't just a river in Egypt, Anderson  Anderson: *shakes his fist violently* damn you, you madman! Me: If I were part of your group, I'd be the nut, most likely Me: I did, after all, spend most of the day pasting Jean-Paul Sartre's head unto a picture of two people on a Vespa scooter
