I am a horrible writer.  I wrote this essay, and it's just plain gross.  Good thing it's worth a shitload of points and it's due tomorrow.  Score.  I can't dance.  I suck at the dances.  I can't sing, and I really can't act.  I don't understand AP chem or precalc, i hate french, and my shakespeare class sucks ass.  What am I doing? I really couldn't tell ya.
