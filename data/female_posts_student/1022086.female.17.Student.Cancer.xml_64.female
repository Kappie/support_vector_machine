Women's colleges are not for me.  2. Colleges located in small towns are not for me.  3. Colleges full of dopeheads are not for me. 4. Watch out for Greek life. Read between the lines. *puts on detective hat* 5. Community restrooms are a-okay.   6. Snooty colleges aren't for me, though I kind of already knew that.  7. I'm really graceless. Really really. But it's okay.  8. I know a moron.  9. Okay, maybe more than just one.  10. Pretty shoes are not always as comfortable as they seem. Do not be deceived!  11. Crap. Spring Break is over.    *yawns*
