Needless to say, i've really loved working here at mikoishi. yeah, really, honestly. Though i've always complained...well...i shouldn't have..cuz only i know what it was like working in Reuters...that stupid company, EOM . o yea....chris's disturbance?? well, i don't mind really...i mean...well...he isn't married i guess..so... Anyway, i really wonder if that lass he went out with was his gf or someone amy set chris up with. I feel real sorry for chris....now i wonder....was he madly infatuated?? But hey, he didn't even bother asking me...or caring when i had my operation. Then again, was he guarding my privacy?? O WHO CARES!! Now final 2 weeks for my internship and he gets me to sit next to him..;) ...wonder if he feels any difference....SIGH*....  I'll be going back to school week after next week....then? o yea...i'll make my GRAND entrance into the SEG canteen right?? haha...i wonder...will those kuttans and kuttis...take notice of me any more...?....i guess those ppl got to know that i'm older than them....:D.....what a joke!! i believe they din think twice that i might have been 21.......that poor bloke...hahaha :D....o well...let see what happens... Not to forget serene's meet next thursday for the presentation....should i wear the nyp t-shirt to piss her off?? :D........no...let's see what i can come up with that day.....
