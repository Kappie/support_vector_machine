So thank you for my fuzzy sweater and my warm house and caring family and school that wants me to learn and friends who good people and little stalkers who are sweet, and chocolate teddy grams...and...blogs...and...livejournals...and naps... and the chance to take a class as hard as AP euro. and... thank you. and i know i dont deserve it, but please can i spend some time with a girl i miss dearly and love like crazy? it would make my week. it would make my lent jar. i would be thankful. please consider it. thank you.
