(First take out the Peyote, hippie.)  http://www.msnbc.com/news/945950.asp"  "Jeff... sweetheart.... this hostility from you is really throwing off my chi.  I am so proud of you first of all for actually reading something other than the sports page and second of all it's so nice that you can feel so passionate about something.  Because I can see that someone becoming Governor of a state we don't even live in is important to you, I will support your efforts entirely.  It's just so darn cute.  And your efforts to use your word "bullets" against me just make me more concerned that you are riddled with anger problems and perhaps we need to turn those "bullets" into "flowers" and maybe turn that frown upside down.  I'm here for you if you need to talk."  "That is just like you damn hippies to be all supportive and what not of those who want to crush your minivans like bug.  Arnold will turn California into a meathead’s paradise where we can all live free and walk around naked quoting Terminators 1-4 and Conan.  What a world we are about to live in."  "I feel your anger and support you, I believe in your dreams and want to encourage you to never ever give those up because without dreams we would simply be pod-people roaming the earth.  Dreams are what make us thrive and make us believe in a world where we can live in harmony.  Whether that world be run by Arnold or whether it be run by flower power, it's important to keep believing in yourself.  Kudos to keeping that dream alive... I support you in all you do.  And really, was cursing hippies necessary?  They're people just like you."  "It is a proven fact that Hippies have tails at birth.  These tails inhibit normal neurotransmitter function to the brain and thus creates the dirty, flower power ideas that roam in their empty drug infested brains.  I will be standing at the gate of Venice Beach and no VWs or solar powered cars will be allowed in.  SMOKE THAT HIPPIE!"  "I do not wish to fight you.  I accept your ideas and will take them into consideration... peace be with you."  "Don’t even try your hippie mind tricks with me.  Now go forth and prosper….. doh!"   ~Jeff and Erin's emails at work (yes, this is what I do all day)
