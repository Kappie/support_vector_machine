I'm ecstatic!!! HAHAHA. I have never felt so blessed. The heavy rain finally stopped and we made in just in time for the Guest of Honour to arrive, so we all got to march!! Yeehaw! Everything went smoothly, except that the NCC kinda screwed up (according to Weeqi) at the last part of the march past. As for the NPCC, I believe that this was the best march past so far, and I'm incredibly proud of my squadmates and juniors who were in the GOH. The supporting contingents were good too, so KUDOS to ya all! Each and everyone of you kicked butt! :D  After marching, Sadhiq, Junior Pui Yoke and I proceeded to the hall to receive our prizes. Remember the 'Good news' which I had mentioned 1 or 2 weeks back and didn't want to type it out in my blog? Well, it was actually Sadhiq and I receiving the Best NPCC Unit Cadet award. It came as a surprise to us, haha. Oh yupp, I took a lot of  urlLink photos ! Go check them out if you wanna :) Man.. I'm really happy today.. I think today is one of the happiest days of my life.   Have a good night's rest my dear friends. Toodles!
