It was crazy and random! Hehe. I got to meet WILL BODE! And make up songs about Sara's man lmao! And Central is oh so low class. I swear they were so ridiculous. Grr..  Today... had a geometry test. It was like all the others -- hard. In English we went to the library and it was really funny haha. I've never laughed so hard in the library. CLAIRE GOODSON ROCKS MY WORLD! Haha. Girl, lunch is going to work next time!! ;-)  We might have a snow day tomorrow! That'd be awesome.. hehe.  Well, Virginia is bitching for the computer, so I guess I have to go.
