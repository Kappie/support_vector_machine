Williams (9-6, 4.41) pitched 7 innings, gave up just four hits and one run, which was anunearned one in the eighth. All the Giants runs were scored in the first two innings off of JOhnson (10-8, 2.83).    But the big scare came in the ninth. Matt Herges, two days removedfrom his Coors field blow up,  came in to try to close the ninth. Once again, he failed his job. He gave up a double to Alex Cintron,and a single the Chad Tracy, moving Cintron to third. Tracy was then bunted over to second by Juan Brito, and Quinton McCracken, pinch hitting for pitcherGreg Aquino, drew a walk to load the bases. Jason Christiansen came to the rescue, and forced Roberto Alomar to ground into a game ending double play.    It was Christiansen's first save in four seasons with the Giants.    Tommorrow, Rich Aurilia returns to the city he played in for nine seasons, this time playing for division rival San Diego Padres      .
