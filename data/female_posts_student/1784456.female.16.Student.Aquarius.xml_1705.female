I'll only ever tell some one else if i think it is really important that they no *like they've seen some ones boyf cheating on them or woteva*. Generally if I have a secret I tell everyone in due course anyway so there isnt really any reason for you lot to talk about me BEHIND MY BACK! but if i dont want everyone to no then i dont tell anyone. The first people that i alwas tell stuff are emily *cos i have a stupid number of lessons with her*, samantha and anna *cos they r my bessie mates* and robyn *pretty bloody obvious why*. God i am starting to sound old! gotta go, some people have just signed in! xxxxx *hugs and kisses*
