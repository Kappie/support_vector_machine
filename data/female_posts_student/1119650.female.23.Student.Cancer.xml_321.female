Lots of friends from high school showed up and we danced and drank into the night.  I woke up at 4 a.m. feeling like the budweiser clydesdales were riverdancing across my head, tylenol fixed that and I worked my lil bummy off.    Friday I went out for drinks at a bar called Barcelona with an unnamed someone.  Details on this someone will come later, but I don't want to jinx anything.  I collected Ashley from the scumbag's house and we wen't BACK to Thirsty Turtle for some good old fashioned drinking and bar dancing.  The "someone" (S.O.) from Barcelona showed up with his friend in tow and we hung out after Ashley left me stranded at the bar.  Me, soemone and his friend went to Davey Burns (a bar which is as much a Greenwich High School reunion as it is anything else) and ate some fries and rode of into the early minutes of the 3 am hour.  It was a really nice night.  I got home to get a phone call from SO to say good night and slept away.  Saturday:  wake up, go to Stew Leonard's with my mommy, came home and hit up the gym and then back over to Ashley's where we pregamed before hitting up turtle.  Met this totally awesome girl called Carrie from upstate New York, totally sweet and her friends were rockin' too, so it turned it to one girly estrogen fest complete with girlie shots and grabbing of boy's bums.  Bob and John showed up at Turtle in the midst of one of our shows on the bar and we hung with them for a bit, they're very chill dudes.  We went to Playland and hung with some rent-a-cops who were drinking Mike's hard lemonade and then back to Davey Burns where we left after 5 minutes.  It was awful.    Sunday was my mommy's birthday so I pampered her and took extra good care of her and it ended with a super yummy hibachi dinner at Abis.  Yum Yum!    I think I'm a little "turtled-out" for now, but I won a free happy hour party from there for 25 people, so I guess one more night out there won't hurt, right?  I wish I could gush a little bit more about SO, but its a little early to have anythign to write about and I'm not sure who is reading this.  I don't care if he sees it, but I don't need all these other G'wich people up in my bidness.  Anyhow I promise to start blogging more frequently and I will start catching up on reading you all and commenting, as I've been quite remiss about it since July started.  Take care, lovies!
