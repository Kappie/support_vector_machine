OK, so I was having a crappy day, and my teacher announced that we would be rehearsing for our graduation ceremony that takes place next Monday. Yesterday it was thirty-two degrees celsius and our school was totally boiling, so of course being cramped into the confines of the gym for an hour didn't sound exactly fun to me, or my fellow students. So, we're put in alphabetical order and I'm between a couple of French immersion (sp??!) guys that I've never actually met before. The staff ushers us into our seats, and I'm sitting at the very end of the row next to one of these guys, who I will from now on reffer to as N.P. (his anitials) The teachers were talking and I was just, you know...staring at the ceiling and wishing for it to end. All of the immersion guys wear their hair sort of like Jet and Rooney do, and N.P., who is not an exception to this whole hair thing, keeps shaking it out of his eyes and glancing over at me.The cynic that I am, I assumed that there was probably something on my face. For what other reason would he keep looking at me like that? He goes, "So, what's your name again?" I reply, "Em." "Ah, that explains the wristbands." And we talk a bit more and he seems genuinely....nice, you know? And I realised that I was sort of in "like" with him. He's actually really good looking and he has a really good sense of humour, and who can really help who they crush on anyways?  Further into the rehearsal I catch him staring at me again, and I laugh and smile because I don't really mind...  N.P: "You like to laugh, don't you?"  Me: "Life is funny."  And so rehearsal comes to a close, and by then I'm actually kind of wishing that the whole thing would just never end, although I have pretty much no idea what was going on there, and still don't. The thing that really sux is that, because he's in French immersion he is almost certainly going to transfer to a different school than me, which gives me all of four days to see him before summer begins, and I totally don't know what to do or what's going on...and I still can't figure any of this out.
