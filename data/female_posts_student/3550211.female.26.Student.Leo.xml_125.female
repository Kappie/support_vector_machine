Surprising as it sounds, the American brewer of Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, also owns the SeaWorld chain, home to several performing killer whales. A British group, Born Free, has no problem with beer, but believes that it is cruel to keep animals in captivity. The most prominent case is that of Corky the orca, currently living at SeaWorld San Diego. For more than a decade, Born Free has advocated a boycott of Budweiser and Michelob as a way of putting pressure on Anheuser-Busch to release Corky and its other orcas. No data was available with which to gauge the boycott's success.   I've been to SeaWorld, and don't consider what they are doing to be animal cruelty. Wouldn't you then, have to consider zoos animal cruelty too? I know there are some people who think that, but I personally don't.
