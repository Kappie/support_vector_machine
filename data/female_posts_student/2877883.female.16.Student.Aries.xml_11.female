Let's see, here are a few things to consider, but most awesome people already know.       Actually, you know what?  I'm definitely not in a cleansing mood.  But I will say that many many people annoy me and I enjoy making fun of them with my other wicked cool and not at all annoying  amies , but that's only once in a while.  But things in general annoy me way too much and I really need to not get so aggravated and annoyed all the time.  Because I know I do.    Way too much.       Other things I do like way too much are Mary-Kate and Ashley Movies and ranting to people who I know don't want to listen to me rant but will let me anyways. Plus I definitely like a boy I've never talked to way too much for never talking to him.  Yeah really should work on that one.  But good things that I get way too into are John Mayer, Gilmore Girls, and my birthday.  But that's all very evident.    I've never been kissed either.  Maybe me and Meliss should start a club.  You can sign up to join if you are wicked cool like us.    OK now that was all very forced cleansing, it's more random things about wicked cool Andrea that I'll let people can know if they wish to.
