Speaking of that, I need to start eating well again, before school starts. I can't start down a bad path again. I think once I can start sleeping in again, I'll be alright. Since I've had to work at bible school this week I've had to get up insanely early and when I wake up early, I eat the world. It doesn't really make sense, but it just seems to happen.    I got my senior pictures taken today. I loved it. It was a lot of fun. I was kind of afraid at first, but after the four hours it took...I got comfortable. What can I say? The camera loves me. hahaha. I got these glasses from the dollar store tonight. They are HUGE and say 'Sexy' on them in Rhine stones. I copied Cody/Sarah/ Catherine. I don't care though because they are so awesome. I got two new CD's today! I burned them, I love burning CD's, especially since I'm broke. I burned the new Taking Back Sunday CD from Sarah and Maroon 5 from Catherine. I'm listening to Maroon 5 now. It's really good! It kinda sucks, we were planning on going for our "annual" skinny dip tonight. I was tired and cranky though and it was bloody cold! Brrr! Maybe another time. It's soo fun! I'm out!
