Hah.]  I can't think of what to say so I am gonna complain for like 50 billion hours, enjoy. ;)  Lauren stole my sweater. She got to the half yearly sale before me and bought the sweater I was gonna buy. Waa. It looks better on me. I think I might buy it anyways because its not like I am ever gonna see her again. Mwa hah!  I forget my english paper. Grr!!! I was mad,but its ok.  Today was my last science and english periods of the year! YAY!  Tomorrow I have a history final. Yuck!!!!!!! And a Spanish final but I heard its just a crossword puzzle! Haha   Lallala. I get to go to nordstroms tomorrow!  Guess what. I owe 21 dollars for my year book! Grr!! and we wont even get them until the 28 of JULY. Sad... :(  I can't think of anyother stupid things in my life right now.  Oh wait i can! Hahhaa  I am being replaced by nick...   But this has been a relly good day!  the science final was EASY!  but then we had to watch this sick science moving. It was like all about how sharks mate in great detail. It was so disgusting, I thought I was gonna puke!
