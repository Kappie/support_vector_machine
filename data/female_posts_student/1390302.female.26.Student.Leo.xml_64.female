The game is tight but great, then you come to the half-time show.  You're sitting with you kiddies -no I don't have any- and you watch Justin Timberlake groping Janet Jackson for the entire world to see.  While singing the lyrics "Gonna have you naked by the end of this song" he rips her costume exposing one of her breasts for the millions of viewers to see.  What do you tell the kiddies?  Yep that's the question of the hour.  What do you tell the kiddies?  The world has been in an uproar about the whole incident; Janet has apologized. Justin has said it was a "costume malfunction." Paul Tagliabue the commissioner of football has said he's taking back the half-time show. The FCC says its going to fine everyone responsible out the ass and check old half time shows for similar problems. MTV has apologized so damn many times that you'd think they were trying to convince themselves that they didn't know. Bob Costas said that its about time they stopped serving the lowest quotient with these half time shows.   I say; "Here, here, Bob!"  Somewhere in footballs glorious past, the commissioner of football lost control of what happens when the game's taking a 15 in the locker rooms.  I have to say that I doubt that Paul Tagliabue could tell you when it happened exactly, he just lost control somewhere in there and this "incident" is what it's taking to wake him up to the smut they have been airing for the past few years.    I mean come on; all Janet Jackson really did was take the next step.  Several years running Britney Spears has gone out there wearing hardly nothing and when he was covered half the time it was with something that was flesh colored to give her the illusion of nakedness.  Its all wrong, what the hell does Britney's ass or Janet's tit have to do with Football?  My husband Matt and I are harkened back to the days of old when Super Bowl half time was full of tributes to old players, high school and college marching bands, flag corps, dance teams, and drill teams.  Back in the days when football was the main focus of the whole presentation, not only the game but also the half time.  So I have heard it said in this past week by friends that they believe Janet Jackson did it to take the heat off of Michael Jackson.  After all the news has been focusing less on his potential child rape and more on Janet's boobs.  Yep, the good ol' news media really knows how to keep their eyes on the real news!  I have also heard it said that she may have done it to promoted her new album which is coming out sometime soon, I'd let you know when but I don't really care to look.  Whatever the reason she did it, it was wrong.  So say goodbye to smut and hello to football oriented half time shows!  I say good-ridden and I welcome with open arms the coming change in football programming.  I have also read that they are going to put a five-minute delay on any and all programs with celebrities.  They want to have time to edit out the celeb stunts.  Thank goodness!    Though I am glad this has awakened a sleeping giant as it were, I am not so pleased that this little irresponsible stunt by Janet Jackson has affected others in a negative light.  A brilliant example of that is the NBA game playoff's where Bioncé was supposed to do a show.  Apparently they scrapped her entire show and now she's going to be doing an AIDS awareness program with some Irish guy.  Another thing this stunt has affected is the broadcasting of ER this week.  They were apparently going to have a small bit of nudity and had to re-write their script or postpone the show for fear of catching flack about it from the FCC and drawing too much attention to themselves.  It goes too far if you ask me.  Though maybe this will teach us and be a lesson for celebs past and present.  Perhaps it will say to them,"wait and look what you doing and what impact it will have before you act arbitrarily."  Or maybe not, but I for one hope it does.  Stars of today need a less on etiquette as bad as they need lessons in acting and singing it would seem!  ~Kristyn
