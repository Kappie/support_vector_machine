Laetitia, you got my hand shaking,  I'm begging you oh baby please stop breaking my heart  because I got the feeling  that you and I will never really get it on.   So I'll leave my door open all night  in case you decide you want to stop on by. Because you got to know.. who's been singing that song on the radio.  The one that goes...   Girl, come to me... The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need,  or I'll be left alone forever with my magazines.    lol im for ever left with my magazines lol im so funnie
