He made some innapropriate rude comment not even about that and I just...lost it on him. Then, I cried. Yes, I actually cried. I NEVER cry. Of all times to cry...prom. Oh well, I got over it pretty quickly. I think I was actually more upset because I was upset by what he, of all people, said. Like, I was mad at myself for even being upset about what he said. I'm still pretty angry at him actually. I don't even really want to talk to him. He needs to grow up and realize what he says and does has consequences. He said something about Matthew the other day too that really made Matthew angry. It would have made me angry too. Ugh. I just wish he'd grow up.   Anyway, now that I'm done with the unpleasant part of the evening, it was actually pretty fun with Nathan. I was surprised. He even danced. It was funny. Half of what he said was, "what?" though. That wont seem funny to anyone else but when I look back on this in like, 20 years, I'll know what I'm talking about and probably piddle my trousers because I'm laughing so hard. And here is my funny little prom story...well, I think it's funny...  So, oh wait, I have two...  First, the saltines which probably wont seem funny to anyone but the people in my group. So, we're sitting there starving, (we were literally the first people there) and we see saltines on the table and so we're all eating these saltines and we ran out, and we're just like..."damnit...we need more saltines." So, we first plot to steal some from the other tables but we were afraid that while we were stealing them, somebody would be walking to that table. So, the waiter walks by and Nathan just, all of a sudden goes, "Hey, can we please have some more saltines?" The guy gave us the WEIRDEST look ever. It was so funny. Then, he brought us back like...so many packages of saltines. Ir was awesome. OK, now the even better story.  When we got to our table we were looking around and looking at the table and stuff and I was like, "Wow, these are nice plates. We should pillage them." But, we figured out they were too big to hide so Nathan's like, "Ok, we'll steal the forks." And so, he takes one of the forks and sticks it in his tux jacket pocket on the inside and I THOUGHT he put it back, only to have this conversation at the end of the night...  Nathan: Here. Keep this as a memento.   And then, he just pulls the fork out of his pocket and hands it to me.  Me: You took the fork?!?!?! I thought you put it back!  Nathan: They WANT you to take the silverware...  Hahaha. So, now I have a fork from Drury Lane. :) Nice memory to have.   This morning was so painful though. I woke up at 8:30 to go to work and, ugh. It was so painful. Oh well. I think I'm going to go sleep now. I'm super tired.  Sorry for the bummer of an opener to this.
