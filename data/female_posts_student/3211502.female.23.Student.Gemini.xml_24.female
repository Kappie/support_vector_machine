Just to make this story complete, let me just give you the details. The toilet wouldn't flush. And, apparently, the previous flush didn't take. The toilet bowl was refilled with water and there wasn't any new water entering the bowl, but there was still the sound of water movement. I called the off-duty emergency super, but, unfortunately, there wouldn't be a handyman until tomorrow morning at the earliest.  What's an un-handy girl to do? I called the boyfriend. Before I wasted my time and his, I asked him if he knew anything about toilets. He said yes. So, I explained the whole situation to him. He asked me if I had looked at the tank yet. I answered with a "What's the tank?" He told me to look inside the tank and see if anything was disconnected. So, I sucked it up and looked in the tank. The plastic part attached to the handle was apparently no longer attached to the part it was supposed to be attached to. I informed Garth of this. He told me to attach it.  After double-checking and triple-checking (okay, and maybe quadruple-checking) with him to make sure the water in the tank was clean, I dug right in and re-attached the handle to its long-lost friend. I flushed the toilet again and, after jiggling the handle a bit, everything seemed to be in tip-top shape. I then called the off-duty emergency super again and informed him that I (well, I did all the work, really) had solved the problem. I did go downstairs, though, to fill out a service request. Just in case. So, until the handyman comes to double-check my work, there is now a post-it note on the door reminder bathroom-goers to use the toilet with caution.
