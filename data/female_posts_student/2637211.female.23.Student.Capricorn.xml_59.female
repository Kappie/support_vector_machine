The O.C.: I didn't think I'd like it, but Alexa went on and on about it, so I TiVo'ed it. Now I'm sold. It's like 90210 but less melodramatic and lame. Everyone is so beautiful and shiny, and I can't take my eyes away from their fabulous clothes and hair. And there's the witty banter that has always been a selling point for me, especially since I got into Gilmore Girls. I think it may actually be more interesting than the Bachelorette. That show has too much lame build up and pretend excitement. I don't know if I can do another rose ceremony. But I do rather enjoy Meredith, and think she's much less annoying than that freak Trista. That girl is so done up. It's weird.  Queer Eye: I'm always a sucker for make-over shows, but this show is getting old. It was fun at first, but I'm thinking that the American attention span is over gays and into the rich, i.e. Paris Hilton and Donald Trump, as exhibited by their new reality shows. I think the next big thing will include hot people trying to get famous... oh wait, I think that's the common theme with reality tv. Huh.  The Tracy Morgan Show: Good old situation comedy at it's finest. Consistently funny, without lame plots involving characters getting out of an embarrassing fix. Makes me feel like I can enjoy sitcoms again. I was beginning to lose heart completely, then along came Tracy Morgan. I loved that guy on SNL, and now he's even funnier. And the kids are genius, comic gold. Oh yeah.
