Friday we hung out with the lovely Christie at a fashion show.  We got to model wedding dresses and the boy got all gussied up in a tux (man, does he clean up nicely!).  It was fun to get all dressed up, I even got to wear a tiara, I was super stoked about that.  Well, that and Christie's Batman Wedding Gown.  Anyhow, we ended up later in the night at this cool bar called the Upper Deck.  They make a mean steak and cheese (damn it, now I'm starving!) and we enjoyed much drinkage and then headed over to the dorms for Dominican College.  (Oddly enough these dorms are at the hotel that  urlLink Jon  and I stayed at after the Ron  Fez Christmas party last year.  My infamous trek down Rte. 59 should have ended there, but no, I ended up in a NY State Trooper Car, drunk and bawling my eyes out, LOL.)  Anyhow, it was in these dorms that I realized: no matter how bad I want to go back to college, there is no way I can live in a dorm.  I am just too old to do it.  The boy and I felt quite out of place when we were there.  Everyone was really sweet and really nice, but it was just wired, like when we had to hide beer for fear of the R.A.   Saturday was a lot of fun as well.  We hit up the diner and got some yumalicious pancakes and then we went to  urlLink Woodbury Commons  for some bitchin' outlet shopping.  I got some sweet new jeans and a cool jean skirt and some sweatpants and some cool Roxy stuff.  The boy got some snazzy new clothes and an Obi Wan light saber.  His little levitating Yoda toy that came with it was a little disappointing though.  It was all and all a giant fun time....  The night only got better though, because we met up with  urlLink Lou  and the Lovely Lisa for some good eating's at this hibachi place in white plains and followed it up with  urlLink School Of Rock  at New Roc City.  We were gonna go play some glow in the dark mini golf afterwards, but we're all old bastids now and we decided to go home and rest our hips and wait for our AARP cards.    Sunday the boy and I tried again to eat at  urlLink Cheesecake Factory , again, but alas it was an hour wait for breakfast, and my tummy isn't that forgiving before its first meal.  We headed over to  urlLink City Limits Diner  instead.  I was almost taken out by a guy in a Porsche, but whatever, it was tasty food stuffs and great company.  Back to Chez Gwen for some maxin' and relaxin' and then we ate with my fam (who absolutely ADORE Doogie, who doesn't!!) and enjoyed some more  urlLink Band of Brothers .  I'm REALLY diggin' this mini series.  Its interesting and well written, the cinematography is great and its overall just amazing.  I'm glad he's gettin' me into this stuff.   It was nice cause we got to have another sleep over last night as well 'cause he's a lucky school system employee and still gets the Jewish holidays off.    Anyhow, that about wraps it up.  I hope all of y'all had a good a time as I did.  Catch ya on the flipside, kiddies!
