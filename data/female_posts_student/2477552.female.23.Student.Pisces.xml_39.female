I should point out however that my last post was made only five days ago and this has been a very very busy and hectic week. All of my papers were due, rewrites spontaneously due and two finals had to be studied for and taken.  I think that people forget what it was like to be in college during the week before exams. It's easy to forget the spazzing that goes on during the struggle to refresh and relearn everything that was covered in each of your classes, especially when you want to get an A.  So I'm sorry, but for right now I have to get back to finishing a grammar analysis essay and a 5 page reflection paper that were both due on thursday and the first paper was due a week ago this last tuesday.
