They had this thing where you voted for your favorite to play an encore and switchfoot lost. waa. I wwas quite sad. Sugarcult beat them. I had never heard of them until tonight. They were pretyy good too, but switchfoot was BETTER!  Today I tried to make lemon squares but I beat the eggs to long and a thing merguine formed on the top. It was kinda nasty...but oh well :)
