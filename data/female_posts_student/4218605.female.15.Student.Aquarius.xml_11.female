When I preview the layout, the sidebar colors are custom. I publish, and nothing's there. ;x Gah. Anyway.  This looks like a richtext mode. I do believe it's HTML compatible, though.  Rofl .. Ira. Remember back in the "old days?" Your Blogger was nospoonsdammit.blogspot.com  Man, that was old sk00l. No spoons. I don't remember how in the world we came up with that but .. it was definately an inside joke. It was when we were going out, I think. I dunno, our relationship, friend and more, was way fucked up.  Moving on.  It's Friday. Last Friday of freedom, holy shit. Just a year ago, things were fuckin'  perfect  with Bob and I. His parents liked me, and had me over for dinner all the time. Now, if I go anywhere near the house, they flame me. Fo' serious. But .. whatever. Shit happens.  Too bad she was killing me.   I'm supposed to be walking to his house today. Well, not his house because his stepdad's parents are there but. We're supposed to be walking around the White Bridge area. Maybe catch some lunch at Wendy's, I dunno. Too bad Alex is grounded from the car until Monday. I guess he deserves it. Despite that being true, I still need him as a chauffeur.  My strawberries have no flavor. That being said, I'm off to get some chips.     HAPPY FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Hahahahaha. Shit. I hope I don't get run over by a car in the process of walking to Bob's.
