Went dog racing last night, i won some and lost some, but end of the night, i came home with £12 less than i went with! It was a bit of a laugh. I really hope loads of people turn up on sunday, will be more exciting/challenging. But i am not a competitive person (lol hehe lol)  Glad to hear that everyone is revising as hard as i am, look foward to seeing as many of you as possible tommrow. Any problems or questions about tommrow, call/text me. Dave
