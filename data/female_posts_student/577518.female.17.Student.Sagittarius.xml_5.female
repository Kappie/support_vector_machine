They sell toys, food, drinks, towel, cartoon bowl and a lot more. If only I can go there, I will shop like a mad cat, because 100 yen is almost RM3.60, so that's cheap and we can hardly find any cheap thing in Japan.  urlLink Yani always drop by at the 100 yen shop with her kids  and her kids really enjoying their time there with those  kawaii  toys. Serena loves 100 yen shop! Wonder whether those RM2 shop will update themselves and sell things like that?
