Didn't have a thought for three and a half hours. Beautiful. Head hurts :( Also dunno how I'm going to get to Vancouver next week. Pllaaaahh... I sincerly hope Mike goes. As our other Adult yac member, he has a responsiblity to go, and if he doesn't....he's costing me an exstra $25 to go....*growls* Damn well better go.  I'm tired. Cranky. Happy. Warm. Lonely. Horny. I'll blog later. Must call fiona.
