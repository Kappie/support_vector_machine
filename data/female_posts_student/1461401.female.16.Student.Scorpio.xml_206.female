So I'm sick, and it's not fun. The penta trip is tomorrow, and so is my doctor's appointment... funny how I'm supposed to be at two places at once...  Oh well. I'm hope I'm better by friday. Friday night I'm supposed to go hang out with alex, and then saturday I'm gonna try to see the last samouri with kevin. Then... sunday.... something? I don't remember. School's going well. We switched art classes, so now I'm in drawing, but Mrs. Meyer's wanted to put one of my projects in the art show so that's cool. Mr. Glandorf is giving me all these stupid rules for my experiment making it so that if I follow them, I won't actually have any real results... I wonder how he'll feel when he realizes I have to break them or else I'll have no research paper... There's no way I'm going to change it this late, so oh well! :-) Vacation wasn't terrible. I got a cold. But I also got to see The Nutcracker, and it was really really cute, so it wasn't totally terrible. I've been whistling Sleigh Ride all day, but that's ok because I really like that song and I'm glad we're playing it in band because isn't it pretty much a tradition for symph to play that in the winter? I think so. Sleepy sleepy.   *yawn*
