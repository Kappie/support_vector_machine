I dont know I do know that I'm surrounded by men who for one reason or another dont want to go to work. Dave wants to spend time getting stoned / drunk or fucking women so there are times he calls in 'sick'. Travis normally talks bad about when Dave does this yet this morning I get up and get him off to work and he tells me he doesnt feel like going. What is the frist thing he does? Picks up the phone to call Alexis. I swear I want to have him bend over so I can just shove her up his ass. He just got this job and he's fucking it off already. I will be so damn glad when I am out of here and I dont have to worry about the baby bullshit crap. I did take somethings back into my own hands last night. Someone called for Dave (some credit card company) and I told them that this was no longer a good number for him and to not call again and then I told Dave what I did. He was upset and I looked at him and said "yeah your point? Your not paying the bill, you never return their call and I am the one who gets the sarcasm. I refuse and if you dont watch it I will make it where your bimbo's cant call here ether" then I walked off. GO ME :) He came over last night and said "Mind if I use the phone" I looked at him and said "Figured it was the  phone or the computer" he asked me if I thought that was all he came over for. I said "no.. you come over to eat too". When he tried to defend himself I told him I was busy to go use the phone and leave me alone.    I finally got smart last night. At least it worked I dont know if it's considered smart or not. I have two fans in my room both blowing on me. I hate heat I tell ya I hate it. When I get up in the middle of the night I find it is still cooler out in the livingroom then in my room. The back door is normally open. Ok my window is open why is it so hot in my room ? So I finally put my fan in my window. I slept with covers ! ! ! YES it felt so good to be cool again. Ok so I know i"m not a genius I do this each year, forget about it until I do it. (sigh) but last night I slept so good afterwards.    Today I feel like something is going to happen. I dont know what it is. That butterfly feeling in my tummy. I hope it's something good. I could use a good break and I hope it's big good and not just small good. I mean I will take small good but I would really like big good type of break.    Well the bad news. :( I just called the school that Joey is suppost to go to and they said that his waiver was denied. No excuse why I have to wait for the pricipal to get into her office to let me know. His old school is being a bitch and not returning calls again. I have to call a doctors office in an hour to get a letter regarding acid reflex for Joey which will be another fight I can feel.. Oh when is that good news going to hit ? I'm looking at one bedroom apartments now. The 2 bedrooms that are within my price range are ether taken or in an area of town I will not move to. I rather go into a one bedroom and deal with that.    Well if that good news hits I will write more later. If not I might write more in venting regaring schools ether way I'm finishing this one for now and going to do some research online.
