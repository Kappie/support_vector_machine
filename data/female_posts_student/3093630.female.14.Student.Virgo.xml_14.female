Fun! and what will i be doing? looking bored and watching kyle avoid tracy. actually if he tells her off it'd be a pretty great show. I have to skip friday...  and all you band ppl- just bring me back some coke ;-) Actually, it's probably a good thing that certain people are leaving for a few days- i'm not gonna say who.   i heard liz phair for the first time in a while. 'why cant i' is the best song ever. damnit.  hehe- BAND PEOPLE HAVE AN AWESOME TIME IN GEORGIA... WIN SOMETHING! AND I'LL SEE YOU ALL ON MONDAY!
