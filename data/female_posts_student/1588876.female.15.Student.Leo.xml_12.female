(nice motive, eh?)  besides my beloved "boarding house- north shore". i have to watch that "smash" show tonight...oh, pardon me, it's "PEPSI PRESENTS- Smash" it looks kinda cool. i think it's like a concert of all these bands and artists. im just watching it for the rock acts- a horse is a horse, of course of course. the ataris, foo fighters, evanescence, and a few other rock bands will be playing. and you know foo-fighters are gonna kick some serious kung-foo-grip ass!   later fellow kelsey hater!
