Saturday I went walking in the Malvern hills with some friends (Lizzy, James and Lizzy’s friend Zoe) which was lovely – especially since I was sorting out the route and managed to not get them lost.  Then we went to see Harry Potter which so SHOULDN’T be a 12 because it’s so scary.  I was petrified of the dementors.   Today I went with James to church – which is this post-modern church that meets in a hotel.  It was really cool – was all about creation this week and they have like different things going on – so you have a short talk and then you can go to the ‘sofa area’ and do this meditation thingy (NOT as in Buddhist monks), or there was a multimedia presentation thing, and then there was a paint table with this cool thing that you put a piece of paper in, then pressed the button to spin it round and then splodged on the paint and it splattered everywhere because of the centrifuge effect.  I had 2 go-s at it!!  Then we went and had lunch at Spud U Like, which is carbon neutral – so it replaces by planting trees all the carbon dioxide it uses in production and stuff.    So ok weekend in all despite everything else.  Will try and blog more next week, although am working everyday.  xxx  P.S Jonathon – CPN is like a counsellor person.
