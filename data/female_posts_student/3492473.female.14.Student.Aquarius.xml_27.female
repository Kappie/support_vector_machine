I feel like I'm a bitch for making such a big deal about needing a break and then two days later, I'm going back out w/ Chris. I seriously thought a break would require more than two days. And I was so worried about losing Chris during that break... But yesterday, Annie, her siblings, and me all went to his baseball game. It was so hard for me because I didn't know how to act or whether or not to cheer for him. I'm not good with the "Do's and Don'ts" of break ups, okay? Then we went back to Annie's and she decided to call him and ask him to come over. And to my delight, he did! See, I still liked him, it was just I figured if we were apart for awhile people would stop saying shit and trying to break us up... but I guess the love I had for him over powered the desire to satisfy everyone else . And I think I'm learning to not care what other people think. So he came over and we were watching the MTV Movie Awards. I was so mad because he was sitting in the chair which left the couch to Annie and me. I wanted to sit by him! It was all so frustrating! I just wanted to hold his hand  but I knew I screwed up and I couldn't do that . So I got to the point where I decided to ask him out  myself . Two days was a break enough for me at that moment. I pulled Annie into her room and discussed it with her...so she sent him a text message saying, "will you go out w/ Lauren?"  I was so scared he'd say no...   So I'm sitting there and he didn't say anything for awhile and Annie asked him if he was playing a game. Go figure, he was. So here I go trying to hit the end button so he can see the message... I put the message on the screen, he read it, and  nodded!!!  Big sigh of relief!! Major thanks go out to Annie, who seriously has to be one the greatest friends ever! See this is the  third  time Chris and me have gone out...and every time Annie is involved in a big way.  Ann , thank you so much for doing this and always being there for me! I love ya with all my heart!  Air , thanks for always being so supportive of my dreams and always being such a great friend!  Kristina , my twin...12 years...so many memories, it's hard to remember them all. We have our little fights but in the end we always come out closer!   , Thanks for giving me yet another chance...you're the greatest boyfriend I could ask for... I'm sorry for being a bitch!  Remember, three's a charm!!   I LOVE YOU ALWAYS n FOREVER!   Maura , sweetie, you know I'm always here for you! Thanks for always being so understanding of my many problems!!   Mike  , thanks for being like one of the girls and for all the hours of advice. And thanks for me getting me to quit and find new ways of dealing with pain.  Gretchen , despite the miles of difference in our lives, you have always been so supportive and understanding!  Alecia , my other half! Hun, I'm so glad I have you! You're sooo awesome! We both have two boyfriends again! YaY! These eight people are the ones who have been so awesome and made such a difference in my life. Each in their own unique way. These eight are the people I can count on, believe, and trust with  anything . It feels good to finally realize, I may not have many friends but the ones I do have are the greatest ones anyone could ask for! I love you all! But I can't forget Candy, Gen, Sheryl, Britt, Kevin, Erin, Reea, Jamie, Tracy, and Ceili...
