When we got there we all hung out with his aunt and we waited for more people to get there. His Uncle Ronny was there with his kids and man were they cute. Me and Ryan took them swimming and then some kind of fish spider jumped on my back. Then we went back to the house and his Uncle made hamburger steaks...HOLY COW they are soo good.        I slept at Ronnys trailer with his little girl that night and then the morning of the 3rd I went and woke up Ryan. We all went out on the boat and we went on the tube. Man it was so fun! I asked his uncle to go easy on me and not to go fast because I didnt want to fall in the middle of the lake. So the whole time I didnt fall off. But wow you should've Ryan he was so awesome. He was doing flips and all sorts of cool shit on the tube. When we went in me and Ryan helped cook chicken on the grill and make a big fire. The whole weekend Ryan was getting into trouble and getting things blamed on him so he was a little cranky but he got over it and still had fun. Then I had to bribe Ronny in letting me stay agian in his trailer and guess what? I got to! hehe...     The next morning was the 4th and he had more of his family coming in. One of his little cousins who was like 10 years old was trying to play footsees with me while we were watching Along Came Polly. Yeah he was a little flirty and it was REAL annoying. It only got worse when his other cousin who was 14 came into the picture. He was pretty flirty too. But you know I had Ryan with me the whole time so everything was all good. We went tubing agian today and his aunts boyfriend took us. we were out for 3 hours and let me tell you this guy didnt care if I wanted to go slow. I got knocked off and I started to swim to the boat. They then told me that I shouldnt swim to the boat because they couldnt see me. I went on about 4 more times and all 4 times I fell or flipped off.      The fireworks were awesome. His uncle went and got like 550$ worth. Me and Ryan shot all them off and one busted and it was a big one. Nobody got hurt though. Then we left the lake and came home...and I cant sleep so I thought I would write.       That was my FUN FILLED WEEKEND!  Night Night
