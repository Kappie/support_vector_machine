I am a happy person right now with alot of expectations to live up on and goals to reach. I will be the second one to graduate hpoefully but the first to go to college which will be really cool!!!! I want to go to u of h because its really close by all my friends and family and i dont want to go to college out of state.I dont think i can handle being away from my friends and most of all my family nope no can do.
