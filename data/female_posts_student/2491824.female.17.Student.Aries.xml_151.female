I guess this really isn't his home anymore since he hasn't lived here for 9 years now...  Geez, kids grow up so fast... :)  I don't know whether to be happy or not..  On one hand, it's going to be cool to see my brother for the first time in, I think, a year or two... Maybe longer -- I don't remember...  But on the other hand, he's probably going to be bitching and making me do stuff, and blah... I don't know..  I wish there wasn't such an age gap between me and my brothers... I was eight when Scott moved out; ten when Jeremy did.  I don't know... There just wasn't much time for quality sibling bonding... All I really remember is getting beat up... Oh, But don't think that I don't cherish those memories... If any thing, they taught me how to defend myself :)  ...They also had a huge part in teaching me reading and writing and math... *sigh* Good times... I also remember that Jeremy was the one that taugh me how to correctly put on underwear....  Heh, I need sleep...  I still don't have that scene memorized for my Theatre3 exam... :/  me=screwed
