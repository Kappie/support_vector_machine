Plus it had one good looking actor in it, Jaquen Phoenix ( idk how to spell his first name) I think hes gorgeous, hes got that mysterious look to him. Then rara and i were craving milkshakes so we went to SnS and greg called me which was surprising, i was like wow ! lol So he called me when i got home with was around 1:30 and we talked for a lil bit. I swear that kid confuses me to death. I dont know what he wants or what hes thinking. At times i think i got him figured out and then he changes on me. i wish i could just get some clear cut answers to my questions but he always leaves me with more lol like he asked me to come up there today , which made me think why? why should i drive all the way up to bfe and for what? i mean yah him and i are good friends still, but honestly theres no reason for me to drive up there, so i can just hang out with him. bc then im gonna be thinking about things and im gonna be wantin to do things, and thats not my place, so its just easier if i say no. Its almost as if he knows im gonna say no, and he only asks me to come up there, so i think about everything.  idk whats going on n e more, im just about to give up trying to figure things out. He knows i love him, and hes told me that hell always love me, and im starting to think if this is all another game, or whats going on. ... well im gonna go and spend some money on good ole Torrid.
