I don't know why you would suggest that I "drink a lot of milk" and I definitely don't know how milk "does wonders for the body". Maybe you should bring a book next time, so you have something to occupy yourself. I would suggest  urlLink this  one.  Cheers, Jane*   *name changed for protection (not really.. :P)
