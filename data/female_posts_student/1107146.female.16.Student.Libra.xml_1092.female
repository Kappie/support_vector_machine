I extend you a warm welcome, even though this is not my Blog.  Do you prefer Michael or Mike?  Just curious.    Yes, you have finally met her, the one, the only...(drumroll) Z, the resident psycho, also known as Linds's best friend and Elizabeth to some lower-class plebians.  (No offense...you didn't know.)  I will probably be the only one who is generally correct in grammar and punctuation EVERY SINGLE TIME I POST.  I am also the resident Grammar Nazi, although Linds is fast approaching my fastidiousness.  And yes, this is how I talk much of the time.  ;)    Sooooooo...let's see.  I'm a good student, I love singing, I play handbells, and I love writing.  I hope that this thing with Lindsey works out.  Just keep in mind that if you hurt her in ANY way, I will be forced to use my extensive fondness and knowledge of painful, medieval tortures and you will pay.  Dearly.  Have a nice day!  ~Z
