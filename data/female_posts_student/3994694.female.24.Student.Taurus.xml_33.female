Interestingly, this year's batch of postgrads are all Pakeha (NZ Europeans) who have gone off for overseas research -- last year most of my class were people from developing countries who returned home for their research.  We started talking about how you just get into this "mode" when you are overseas, especially in a research situation. Nothing shocks you or surprises you, and you accept any trouble or that comes your way as almost expected. People ask me how I could go and live in a village in an isolated part of China, without knowing anyone or understanding their dialect of Tibetan. Without them understanding who you are, why you are there and even where you are from. But really, you just do it. You just stop thinking about that, and go ahead. You make your plans to travel, you have no arrangements of what will happen when you get there. When you get there you meet some people and you make some arrangements for where you will live. Then you just do it.   Most of the time you are totally out of whack culturally. Everything is strange -- the way people walk, the way people sit, the way people act in public, the way people stand in relation to you, the way people talk, the way people wash, the way people sleep -- everything is totally alien. After several days environmental factors lead you to understand some things -- you wash your hair outdoors in the sun in the afternoon because if you do it any other time its too cold. The floor is so dirty because people treat it like the ground -- traditional houses have dirt floors, you wear shoes, and you don't put anything on the ground even if you have concrete floors. You walk ridiculously slowly because of the altitude and you get too puffed. And so on...  But then there's some things you never understand. That you just have to accept, and they eventually become normal. You brush your teeth before breakfast. Because. You drink lukewarm boiled water -- not hot or not cold, because.  Eventually, you are not a total alien. You are accepted as a part of the community and as a stranger simultaneously. People accept your need to use toilet paper. Accept your need to drink cold water instead of tea. Accept your need for personal space although the concept is quite alien. And you get along. You even start to imagine you belong. And eventually, you do.  Then you go home.  Everything is the same. But you are different. And it starts all over again, but with a weird kind of dislocated sense you've done this all before.
