I got to spend a lot of time with my Dad's side of the family, and I'm looking forward to my brother and sister-in-law coming to town next weekend. :-)  I just got home from Ricky's where I had a very fun time tonight.  Along with his family and Jennifer and Melissa... I played an interesting game of Pop Culture Trivial Pursuit (the one with the DVD) and it was very fun.  Then we watched The Hulk... and then I came home.  :-)  Anyhow, I'll post more details of things from my family time (Christmas Day) later.  For now, I shall retire to my bed where I may dream sweet dreams of the person I shall end up with.  :-)
