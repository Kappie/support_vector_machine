I say she'll be dead on her feet by the end and actually looking forward to *shudder* school. You see My Lord of the rings party is on Friday. We'll probably be up till like 3am or 4am. From there she will most likely be picked up at about noon, where she will clean her house and have a brief nap. From there she will eat dinner, once she is done with dinner she will have another group of friends come over to her house (they're grown up girl guides) to watch more movies and eat more popcorn. Then all the girls will leave (the next morning), and Bethie will go with her family to see a movie (Shrek 2). I swear the theory works on paper and it has been approved by parents. But will she survive?   Like I said Bethie is my Marx.   Well I must be off now I have to do my mandarin home work, I really don't want to but I really don't think that I have a choice in the manner... Grr... Must raise mark to a B... Must raise mandarin mark to a B... Must make honours with distinction!    P.S. Honours  is  spelt with a U... I'm Canadian OK? Good... Because  our  spelling makes sense.
