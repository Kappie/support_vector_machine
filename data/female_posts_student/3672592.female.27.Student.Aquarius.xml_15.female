I think if you don't book before hand you're not going to get some of the movie. You may not realize that you're not getting it, but there a lot of parts left out. There parts or lines I kept expecting to hear and they didn't happen. I understand that the books are getting longer and they are trying not to make the movies longer, but I definitly recomend reading the books before you see the movies. I don't know if I like the new Dumbledure. I know we can't have Richard Harris back, but Micheal Gambon is not Dumbledure. I hope that the next one will be better. I'm ready for the next book to come out. There are just two more books to come out.
