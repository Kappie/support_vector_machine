Nasty, nasty sandwiches. White bread, ham and cheese loaf, and mustard. I'm very picky when it comes to my sandwiches.  Then we went over to the house where the party was. There was another Ashley, who kept calling me "Jacquelyn". On purpose. She was the one who threw a cup of water on Jessica and busted her lip. Ashley also iced Jessica and Ashley's underwear.  Jessica, Ashley, Jenny, and I did circle drills on the porch. We marched and walked in step the whole time. We're band nerds. We offered to sleep in the camper, and Carmen Bimrose joined us when she got out of the shower. I froze to death, I have poor circulation in my feet. When I take off my glasses, I go into sleep mode even if I'm not tired, because I can't see. So I didn't sleep, but everyone THOUGHT I was. I didn't have the energy to correct them when they told each other to be quiet because I was sleeping. I shared a bed with Jenny but she wound up in the other bed, because they were talking and I was asleep. Jessie and Emily joined us around three in the morning. We stayed up literally all night. We fell silent about thirty minutes before we were awoken. The mother's house we were staying at woke us up thirty minutes late. 13 girls in one bathroom in twenty minutes.  The guy who drove the van pissed me off. He's one of those guys who likes to think he's all fun and openminded. He made stupid rules. He wouldn't let us sleep in the van. And he spoke to all the girls like we're stupid of something. "Jasmine. Jasmine. Yes, you. Get the soda, the green lemon-lime soda out of the red cooler. The red cooler in the van. Yes, Jasmine. You." And when we stopped at gas stations, he ORDERED us to "go tee-tee".  Jessica, Ashley and I spent about two hours hoeing and raking a HUGE plot of land perfectly flat. They used the dirt from our perfect area to put in another area, so there were huge tire tracks across it. Yeah, we tried so hard not to make any hoe jokes, because you know we're more mature than that, but somehow they just slipped out. The heads of the hoes kept coming off, and I kept telling Jenny not to beat her hoe up, but to treat it gently. And there weren't enough hoes to go around, so we had to trade hoes. Jenny didn't want to give up her hoe.  After lunch, Jessica and I were so tired. We went "exploring" in the house, and we hid in a bathroom for about thirty minutes, then we found a closet and got Jenny and came back. The house was built in the 1800's and burned down, then was built again, and burned down again right before it opened. It was a pregnant teen shelter. One of those "I'm going to stay with my sick aunt" places. Now it's a girls' drug and alcohal abuse shelter.  Jenny and I have so much fun together, she's my pillow sometimes, when we aren't forced to move. We both love Zoolander, and we were quoting it all day. "What is this? A center for ANTS?! It has to be at least...THREE TIMES bigger than this!" "There's more to life than being really, really, really, ridiculously good-looking." And she does a great Stuart from MadTV. "Say that to the microphone."  Update on the sunburn: My face is still peeling, but it's red underneath, so I burned like, all my skin. It'll be a couple weeks, probably months, before I'm back to normal. I hate being red, I don't look right. I look beautiful with like, no color on my skin. It looks right on me.  My shoulders, which were really, REALLY hot on Thursday and Friday, have developed more since then. Wearing ANYTHING on them hurts like a bitch. Seriously, I think I'm going to die. In the two hours I've been home, they've started to blister. Before I took my t-shirt off, they were purple. Dark purple. And you can see broken blood vessels under the skin. My mom doesn't think it's serious. Oh, and my boobs are blistering. You have NO IDEA how uncomfortable this is.  On the way home, I heard the STUPIDEST crap. Christian talk radio is seriously misinformed, they don't make any valid arguements. They're like, "We need to stop gay marriages because God said so, and the majority obviously agrees with God." Oh, and they talked about Lauren's city. Paradise Valley. Something about a new elementary school offering tiles and somebody wanted to write "God Bless Someone" on a tile and the school wouldn't let them. The arguement against it is that since they're allowing other cultures to express things through their interpretations, they should be allowed to use the word God. Well then, I want to get a tile that says, "I eat children." Because that's how I see the world.  I'm not thinking straight. I'm tired, exhausted, dehydrated, and I have many, many more ailments. But I'm in go-mode. Early Week has got me used to working on autopilot, which is good practice for school. I've learned that I can be a fully functional human being on fifteen minutes of sleep in over 48 hours.  Oh, yeah, this morning she knocks on the camper to get us up, and I like, jump out of bed, grab my stuff, get in the house, go into this room where there are people sleeping, strip down and change clothes, go into the living room and stretch, eat breakfast...I did all this before anyone else woke up. That's how I am in the morning. I force myself to get up and go, but if I stop for any reason, that's it. I'm not getting up. I don't allow myself to think about not doing something. When I was eating, I stood and practiced pointing my toes. Ha, everyone's like, "Jasmine's such a morning person. Look at her go." The first words out of my mouth: "It is neither good nor morning, so I don't want to hear either of those words until at LEAST noon."  I WAS planning on working tomorrow, I got a call to go in today when I was gone, but I couldn't. That makes me feel unreliable. I am, but still. Anyway, I can't put anything on my shoulders, that includes work uniforms, therefore, I'm not working until next weekend. I need the money, so badly, but there's nothing I can do about that. Working isn't happening. And I called my dad and asked for 25-40 dollars to help pay for my contacts. I CAN pay for them all, but whatever he can give is more towards clothes I need. I have like, three shirts I would consider wearing, the rest have basically become workout clothes or sleep clothes. And I know I sound picky, but I'm really not being that way. And after Thursday, it's not like I can't not have contacts. I've already killed my glasses, my depth perception is WAY off from hitting myself like five times, and the worse my glasses get, the more likely I am to hit myself.  Oh, and one last comment: Lauren, you would be so proud. We played DDR, the Playstation version, and I kicked everyone's ass. My first time ever touching it. Honestly, those hours playing Flash Flash Revolution helped my timing or something. Guard helps, too. I mean, I'm sure anyone else could kill me at it, but I'm still pretty proud of myself.
