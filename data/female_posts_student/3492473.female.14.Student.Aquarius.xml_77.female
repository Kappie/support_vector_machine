I admit, I'm guilty of that too so sorry! But I just got into this "big discussion" with an this person and  I could really care less.  I guess when you have two days to just sit around because you're burnt to a crisp (did I tell you guys I have horrid sun burn? oh well, I do...), you have nothing better to do but lay in bed and think (and read, which I did a lot of that too!). And let me tell you, I thought about a lot of shit. And here I am just smiling...
