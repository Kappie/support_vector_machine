They were happy to have me at work because they were under staffed. There were a lot of people there today not surprising though cause it was really hot! I got soooo SUNBURNED. Ouch!! My arms and back and face are all really red and sore!!! But oh well I love the job so I can't complain. They threw us a pizza party after work because we are just plain amazing! No really it was for helping them out and being really good at work all day despite the long rotations. My rotation was literally 1 hour and 45 min long!!!!!!!!!! Talk about BORING same spot for that long, the water never really does anything (haha) but oh well! I am gunna go call Jess, then watch Summerland (best show) maybe I'll be on later!!
