I'm 15, an insomniac, a hopeless romantic, a loser who's friends are drifting away, and just plain old crazy.  Call me crazy. Wasn't that the title of a song or something? I think it was.  I like to write, and take pictures. And for some reason I'd like to be a psycologist when I do the whole career thing. Yeah. The crazy helping the crazy.  My favorite is "Insert favorite something here."
