If you're still reading, you're in for a little treat, you Canadian Idol fans (which basically means you, amy...and maybe jadie n steph too)- THEY'RE GOING TO BE ACCOMPANYING THEMSELVES ON INSTRUMENTS THIS THURSDAY!!! WEEEEE!!! yes, i   do   love the musician! and you said they weren't talented, kelly! yes, they can do more than  just  sing (as if singing is really even that easy)! but we shall not get into that argument again.    must get tickets for next week! i shall go for lunch early and line up very early! and going to CNE monday! yay! CANADIAN IDOL LIVE! :) even if we are far away and can't get autographs...  it's the singing i go for, it's the performance that makes me stay! heh heh! :P ;) i should go now...sleep is a wonderful thing! don't underestimate it or take it for granted kiddies!
