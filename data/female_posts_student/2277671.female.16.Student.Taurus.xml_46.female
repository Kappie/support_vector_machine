S0 i'm tryin to upl0ad 'Scarface' pictures onto my  Lovely  AOL but its 'trippin' right now or i sh0uld say it has been for the past few days.  Cristina, i'm glad youre happy. .. shhh* Keep it on the hush, Right?! Right. S0me pe0ple think to0 much of things like when they are 0n h0ld for hella l0ng.. have you ever thought,  maybe the call wasn't f0r me.. and that i didnt call you back because all you d0 is sit there on the ph0ne anyways?   If i wanted to sit in silence i can just g0 in my ro0m , i d0nt need to be 0n the ph0ne f0r that . Take it h0wever y0u want. =)  enjoy . So anyways, i was thinking.. about this past year..and h0w fast it has gone by... And yeah its g0ne by fast. Even th0ugh when i lo0k back, things Ive d0ne this year, seem like they have happened  hella long  ag0. Like this time last year hmm, same thing was g0ing 0n between Kayla  I, n0t talking, but last year f0r n0 reas0n.. even though i'm n0t sure the reas0n now.. My take on the wh0Le situation is...  T0 be a g0od friend, you've g0t to be g0od t0 y0ur friends.  I think that 0ther pe0ple g0t in the way of 0ur friendship, and yeh she did me dirty n all but its c0o u know? i d0n need friends like that. I learn fr0m the pe0ple around me, I d0nt want pe0ple to think of me h0w  i think of my 'friends' s0o ima make sure i d0nt pull that shit... Then at the beginning of the new semester 0f my freshman yr... i g0t heavy int0 some shit ... kickin it wit Kristin.. i think that was the m0st fun i had all year.. n0 Lie.. And i  d0nt regret a damn thing   that happened. I d0nt even regret getting caught, but i'm glad i did...  i think stepping away fr0m that 'cr0wd' and th0se 'activities' sh0wed me s0me shit ya kn0w... because i was just d0ing it t0 do it.. and  i g0t caught, and i c0uld talk ab0ut it, and the wh0le thing br0ught me hella cl0ser to my m0m... and i think that wh0Le thing 'matured' me a LiL bit...  Im happy with myself f0r getting away fr0m the pr0blem.   That wh0Le time peri0d seems so far away.. kinda like... ' Damn  that was this year?'  And  what the fuck  was up wit me and th0se guys last yr...? I mean damn l0ok wh0 i g0t caught up with..  Justin .. [wh0a i d0n even kn0w what the hell was up wit that.. ] D0nte..  [ n0 c0mment] ->They didnt mean shit... they were just all talk.. wantin s0methin i wasnt b0ut t0 give them ...  hella cLose..   *wink wink*   nAa juSt playen... buT.. wE tried that wh0le 'talkin/reLati0nship' thinG  twice  and it just c0uldnt happen, which is g00d, because we hella co0L now... weLL wheN we taLk... buT yeh we hAd some g0od times this past summer...And Pj... that man wh0re... o0h g0d .. d0nt get me started ... *washed away... no l0nger a part of my th0ughts...* i'm surprised at h0w easy they all were t0 forget...hAha thats cause they werent shit to0 me...And this yr... theres the l0vely Mr. Markus... but i w0nt say anything ab0ut that... And yeH yaLL aLready know wh0 else im quiet ab0ut.. s0oo0 i d0n even kn0w wsup wit that, just kn0w.  I'm n0t trippin  haha, y0u kn0w what.... they are all black guys... I d0nt think i w0uldve made it thr0ugh this year w/o my 0Lder br0ther.. like last night, he was at his h0use and he called me at like 3 in the m0rning and was like y0u cant sleep, huh? and i was like n0pe.. n0t at all, and he said he w0ke up and felt like he needed t0 talk to me, s0 he called, and then he came over, and we just talked until ar0und 7 when he had t0 g0 t0 w0rk. He just understands me s0 well. He is 0ne 0f the m0st d0wn t0 earth 'foos' i kn0w.. and i can c0unt 0n him f0r anything, and he w0nt trip... " keep ya head up sLick... d0nt be messin wit them crazy f0o's monica... be alright.." This year, my m0m g0t a Lot w0rse, and i d0nt usually talk ab0ut her health and all, but  i'm sorry  she gets on my nerves hella bad.  And she is my m0m n all... and i l0ve her , but she makes me feel hella bad, because she'll say shit like " oh i'm sorry i cant be a better m0ther, i'm such a l0usy mother.." And you kn0w i c0uld care less what she can and can n0t d0 .. jusS that she l0ves me and wiLL always be there f0r me as a m0ther and a friend.  I c0uld n0t live  with0ut my m0ther and w0uld never want any0ne else t0 be my m0ther... she has sacrificed hella t0 make me happy... and f0r that i'm thankful.. t0 have s0me0ne wh0 will  always care  . s0. Thr0ugh everything i've ever d0ne.. i can say there are s0me things i regret, and s0me things i d0nt... but as time has g0ne by and i have g0tten 0ver those things.. i see now what ive learned fr0m it all... and  i mean , i can hella trip 0ver s0mething, but eventually time will take it away.. and  it will all just be s0mething to 'lo0k back' on.   This all g0es back to Cristinas thing about being 'real' [well.. kinda] But..  What is real?   i juss d0nt get it...  Everyb0dy just needs t0 stop fr0ntin.. [haha]  'd0n h0ld back, what if t0morr0w never c0mes and that pers0n is n0 l0nger ar0und... what w0uld y0u d0 then? h0w w0uld y0u feel? '  you kn0w what else i was thinkin b0ut? visiting my family.. i d0nt d0 it simply f0r the fact that i d0nt feel welc0me around them , due t0 the fact that they are c0ld hearted pe0ple. Like my 'father' for instance.. He has had plenty 0f chances to try t0 be in my life.. instead 0f me, he ch0se a new family with a crazy ass lady wh0 hella changed him ... and even bef0re that, he never came and g0t me or anything. And my family is talkin, oh well y0ure 0ld enough n0w to take responsibilty t0 c0me see him?  RESPONSIBILITY?   Excuse me, what is the resp0nsibility 0f a father? D0nt put that shit on me.  Ive tried. And ive given up h0pe 0n him. iTs hard f0r me to let any0ne in, just for the fact that the 0ne man i'm supp0sed to trust, d0esnt want much t0 d0 with me. And when he d0es , hes g0nna have to realize,  he fucked up.   ...Take it t0 the grave... Pe0ple can say shit, like they are g0nna change, and '0h i want to change' and y0u can  want  t0 change it, and h0w you are and stuff, but  i think that is s0mething that happens on its own. a matter 0f a 'pers0nal reality check'.  So i'm thinkin... shit will c0me naturally, what shit i'm talkin about, i'm not sure... but if its meant t0 happen, it will come. S0oner 0r Later. Damn , i feel hella better.    *cheers  "  To a new year... "
