Yeah, the only sport I've ever played was Cheerleading (Yes I consider it a sport. I've got a bunch of problems as a result)and there was softball in like 5th grade for like a day. So I'm gonna give this a try. I don't wanna be a dumb cheerleader, and I know I never could handle track, basketball, I think I've made like 10 hoops my whole life, I think I have pretty good hand-eye coordination, so I'm gonna give it a try. Dacia refuses to do this with me so, I'm on my own.
