It's located at two malls, one is on the main artery street, Jalan Dago at  Plaza Dago . The other location is at  Bandung Trade Center , ground floor, just beside the south entrance of the mall. This is the one I went to just yesterday.    Interior Design   Overall, the place itself is a comfortable place, suitable for an afternoon breeze or a fast lunch. I don't know how the one at Plaza Dago looks like, but I assume it's quite similar. Some of the tables are quite unique. They are made from wood and on the center has this glass pane, underneath are coffee beans. The color scheme is...well, black! With a touch of brown from the wood. Not exactly my favorite color scheme, but still attractive.    The Menu, Please   The cafe serves...coffees, of course! All kinds of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, etc. I chose a  Black Mint Coffee , which taste excellent! Then for the meal, I choose  American Pancake , which also delicious! Other personal recommendations are  Sunrise Crepes , crepes with orange filling and sauce; and  Tuna Sandwich , loves those tuna salads! The menu lists coffee (hot and cold), sandwiches, pancakes, pastas, fajitas, and snacks. The price range is between 7,500 to 30,000 (in Rupiahs). Pretty expensive, especially if you only want to unwind and have coffee, but believe me...the price is worth it!
