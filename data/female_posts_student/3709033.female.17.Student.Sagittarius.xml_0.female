"i hope youre on the run because your ass is mine."  what the fuck.  i am seriously in complete and utter disbelief.  my mother doesnt call me.  she makes up excuses not to come see me.  when i visited her she threw stuff at me and told me to get the fuck out.  when i call her she yells at me about crazy things.  and all of a sudden she thinks shes going to have some say in my life?  i seriously cant believe she has the nerve to do that.  she doesnt even act like im her daughter.  so that gets anyone whos interested up to speed on my life at the moment...im supposed to be writing an english paper but im going to wait until i talk to dad to do so...if i really have to go home tomorrow then what the fuck is the point right?  im going to call dad sometime later today and try to talk with him logically, and remind him that im a person.  for now im reading timequake and drinking smart water.  also before i go i would like to comment on the massive amounts of apathy in the vcu police or whatever system.  dad told me that i was officially a missing person on campus, danielle told me someone had come up and asked for pictures of me, and the people at the front desk were supposed to be watching for me.  so far the only thing thats happened is that ive found a note in my mailbox that says "call your father".  yay vcu.
