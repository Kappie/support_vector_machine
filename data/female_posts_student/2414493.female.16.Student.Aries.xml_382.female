It went out with last week's recycling.  I don't know why I was suddenly panicked. Maybe that's not the word. I just remembered it for some strange reason (obviously, the reading doesn't remind me in the least bit of a picture lying at the bottom of the recycling  bin).  There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade and now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all and here I rest  where disappointment and regret collide lying awake at night, up all night when I'm lying awake at night  Perhaps it plays into that girl/masochistic complex, but whenever I reflect upon it, I tend to think that I'm the one who was cheated out of so many things. I can bring up so many examples. But then I remember I wasn't the fairest party in the situation either, so I must've committed my share of wrongs.  I don't understand why it's still so important to me, though it's not so in its original sense. I just can't get rid of it somehow. It's not like I hate him outright, but I don't particularly embrace him either. Makes good conversation, but will sign off abruptly. As he should, I'm not the nicest person to talk to, frankly. It's one of the biggest things that've changed me, though if I think about it, it wasn't such a big deal at all. It's a place to draw so many anecdotes.  I really have to go read now, and you probably didn't want to read this strange reflective babbling...
