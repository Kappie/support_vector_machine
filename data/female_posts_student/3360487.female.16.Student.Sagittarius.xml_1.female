Afterwards I went to Gordman's and right as I was about to buy my stuff I realized I left my main credit card at home.  I was like "ok I'll just pay with my other credit card" when they said my credit card was DECLINED.  WHATTTT?  I put my stuff on hold and went home and called, apparently the stuff I wanted to buy was $1 over my limit and since it's a teen card I can't go over.  Bah.  I got my card, went back  got my stuff.  I got a super cute black bra purse, 3 adorable shirts, and I stole a white dress and some chandelier earrings from the mall across the street.  I was all dirty and sweaty and greasy and smelly so I took a shower and got ready for my mom's concert.  I put on a cute dress and some makeup and the concert was great.  Afterwards there was a reception for her and we got to eat shrimp and discuss piano with old farts.  Great fun.  Came home and that was about the end of my day. :)
