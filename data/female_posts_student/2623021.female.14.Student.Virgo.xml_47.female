I think that it's only because he doesn't get any action with Felicia and their relationship is totally emotional. My last relationship was totally physically, and has nothing to do with commitment or emotions, (which became too clear to me as time went on) expessally when we just started fooling around after we stopped dating. Felicia and I both now what the other is feeling and what we are going through, we are going through pretty much the same thing. I wish that everything could be better, and that the guys saw everything from our point of veiw. I believe that me and Felicia being totally single is deffinetly for the best. There are some things that need to be done, and realized. We both need to figure eveything out on our own, with help from each other, and without guys. A relationship needs to be the same amount emotional, as physical. It seems people who are together for a really long time (in high school) haven't had sex, they do everything but. That is probably the way to go because (as I hear from two of my friends that dated and broke up) sex is the only thing that holds them together, and that it become to seem that it became expected, and boring. I think that sex would become really boring if you had it, over and over and over, and it would lose it's zeal... I think that to truely appreciate it you shouldn't have sex until you are married, then it would be something very special.     You should never regret anything that you ever do, you should learn from it, and move on and not make the same mistake twice. I know that I have been talking about *him* a lot lately, and it is partially because I still like him, and partially because I learned so much from him. I know it didn't last long, and you all probably think that I'm obsessed, but I'm really not, I'm just not ready to let it go. I'll be fine with time. "Time heals all wounds" is what they say.     But time doesn't heal all things. It's been 8 years since my grandfather died, and whenever I think about him I still cry. I was only 6 when he died, actually 5 almost 6. Too much has hit me at once. I decided to think about my guy problems because it takes my mind off of the fact that my family is all dying around me... My other grandmother isn't doing that well right now either. In and out of the hospital, can't go anywhere without oxygen... yeah. I have yet to see a silver linning on any cloud. I think that it's more like, there's a cloud on every silver linning. Why can't one GOOD thing happen to me?? Just absolutely good, nothing bad attached to it, just good. Why can't I be happy with myself? Why do I always have to see the bad in things instead of the good? I truely wish that I could just be entirely happy, forget about everything bad, just for a day. I wish that I could just stop crying! I managed to not cry the whole time I was on the phone with Felicia, which was around two hours. Other than that, I've cried through the night, and through the day. I'll stop crying a while and then I'll think of anything, and there I go again crying for the next two hours... I'm crying right now. I'm just grieving my mother tells me, my dad says that I walked into the middle of something terrible, which I did... Why did I have to come here. I don't want to have to deal with family, I wish I could just go mourn in private, I know that I should be happy that my family is here, and that I can be with them, but I'm not. My grandfather tells me that Grammie wouldn't want for me to be crying. I know that she wouldn't want me to be crying. I know she's up there watching down on me, on us. They all are, Grammie, Grandpa, and Grammie Abby. My poor little cousins, Ross is 10 and Nicole is 7. I don't remember Grandpa much, and I just don't want them to forget Grammie... she meant so much to me. I wish I could have been there for her, with her. I can't believe this is actually happening. I was looking through one of the piles of random things, and I saw a paper, and on one side my grandmother had written a poem, and on the other side it said 1993 in the corner, and in the middle it said "We love you, Joanne, Samantha, and Joelle." Sam and I actually signed it, my name was spelt, Jolle (with the J backwards) and Sam's name was slanted. The poem that was on the other side, was one that none of us had heard before, and that none of us knew why she had written it, but it said...  "The way I walk    I see my mother walking   My feet secure    and firm upon the ground.   The way I talk    I hear my daughter talking.   And hear my mother's echo    in the sound.   The way she thought    I find myself now thinking.   The generations linking    In a firm continuum of mind.   The bridge of immortality    I'm walking~   The voice before me echoing behind."      *Analizing the poem*It's saying that as a family we all hold a piece of each other in us. "The bridge of immortality... I'm walking." I think that means that I am part of the immortality of my family.. I am carrying on our traditions, and our lives. I have a piece of each of them in me, and they have a piece of me in them. "The voice before me echoing behind." I would like to think of that as it would fit my life right now. My grandmothers' voices are infront of me, I will be with them soon, [in 70 years... give or take] and they are echoing behind, because now they are just memories from my past.     I really have to thank my father. He toldme the day before I left for Maine, to call my Grandmother because if I don't I may regret it. So I called her later that day, while in 7-11 with Suzy and Felicia. I figured that I would talk to her the next day, I had no idea that that would be the last time I would ever talk to her. She told me about her surgery, and how there was a 80% chance that she would be fine, and the surgery would go without a hitch. Well it looks like she's in that 20%... She told me how much she loved me, and I did the same. She started crying in the middle of the conversation, which made me cry, and I got off the phone shortly after. She gave me the impression that she was ready to die, and absolutely okay with whatever was to happen. "I want the surgery so I can get better, and if it goes well, then great, but if I die then it's god's will and it's what he had planned for me." I learned that I was the only one she talked to about the surgery and about dying until after the surgery... That really touched me, in a way that I can't explain, like she trusted me with something that she hadn't told anyone else, and hadn't wanted to talk about with anyone, but she decided to share it with me.     I trust god completely, my Grandmother was a completely devoted Catholic, she introduced God to me, and took me to church every Sunday until 4th grade. I decided that I didn't want to go to Church anymore, and that I still believed in God, but I didn't need to go to Church to be an active Catholic, well the years went by. I went to a couple different Church's along the way, I went to FCC for a while. Then I wasn't really into it. Then in 8th grade, my friendship with Tori became very strong, and she convinced me to go to her Church, the Nazarene Church. I went on and off my 8th grade year, then towards the end of it I became a very active Christian I wouldn't miss church. I would be there every Sunday, and go to youth group, and bible study during lunch at school. Then I went away during the summer, and returned to being a very Christian girl. I wouldn't date a guy that wasn't Christian, and I wouldn't curse, and I wouldn't do anything rebelious in any way. Well in the middle of my Freshman year, Tori switched Church's, and slowly I faded away from the Church. Felicia and I would have long conversations about religions. Between Daril and Felicia, they brought me to opinion that Church was just a hox, (Mainly Daril... actually all Daril) and that there was no way that there could be a God. I stopped going to Church completely. Drifted away from religion, and convinced myself that I was an Atheist... "A recovering Christian" as Daril put it. But the truth is, I was absolutely happy as a Christian. Things seemed to be better for me, after I stopped going to Church I started hanging out with people who weren't the best for me. I did things that I shouldn't have I. I got into some bad things, started having bad habbits again. Cursing, and doing things that I knew I shouldn't have done. Being with the wrong kind of guys, hanging out with the wrong kind of girls. [No offence to anyone... I don't mean to offend anyone... so please don't be mad at me for this]  I believe that every experience plays a part in me being who I am. Those that hurt me make me stronger, those that weren't that smart, make me wiser, those that are not well thought out, make me think about things more carefully. I wouldn't change anything that I did, I will think about things in the future, and hopefully things are clearer to me, but I know that everything happens for a reason, and that everything that is happening, is happening for a reason, and who am I to mess with that or regret it?     I have came around to realizing some things lately. I've grown up a lot this summer, a lot has happened this last two months. Since the begining of May, I have realized who my true friends are, and how the wrong friends can really mess me up. There are many paths that lead to the same destination, there is an easy one and a hard one, one that will end quicker than the other one. Choose your path wisely, remember there is no turning around. There are forks in the roads that will either help you get on the right path, or deter you from it greatly.
