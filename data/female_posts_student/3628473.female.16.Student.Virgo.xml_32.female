I thoughtit wasfunny to hear this all. Or read it i should say...seeing how everyone goes through it. The high on God, cause your a way. And i dont think there is noting wrong with it, i mean we all go through that time. i know i did. But after a while you relieazeGod is more then just a camphigh that you can only get when you are around your church friend, and away from home...So...speaking of retreats my youth church is having one, and to tell yal' the truth, i'm not like "o thank God!" Its no big deal for me... I'm been blessed to get on a high for God,every time i talk to him, every time i read his word, everytime i say "i'm going to do this for the Lord"...Those our my highs...As for my best friend, he does get high on God....However, getting away is something he seems to need.... Seeing how someone esle wont be there, i can only hope god blesses this retreat and helps him before the retreat...    So again...i'm the only one out of all my friends that isn't dating....Except for the few...But guess what.... Its a blessing! O my gosh...I love it. i love not having a boyfriend...i wonder why i didn't do this sooner...heh... And i leave with this note, something T and i read last night... From Isaish 8:13 - "Do not fear anything except the LORD Almighty. He alone is the Holy One. If you fear him, you need fear nothing else."
