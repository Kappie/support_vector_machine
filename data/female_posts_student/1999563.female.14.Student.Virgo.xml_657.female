I can no longer be the innocent 7 year old. I have to take DRIVERS ED!! I never want to drive. That's why I am going to move to a big city so I can just take public transportation. Driving scares me. I don't want to kill any person or and animal. That would make me cry for days and months...maybe even years.  See...now I am a sophmore. Now I have to learn how to drive and take the PSAT.  Before I know it I will be a junior and I will take the SAT and apply to colleges.  Then I will be a senior. I will have to finish my high school years..  And then I am off to college.  A foreign land.  All by myself...  I seems pretty scary. I mean really...4 years from know I will be by myself at this huge univeristy.  It just scares me.  Why can't I just stay this age?  I am 14.   I can get away with being immature...like trying to see how many grapes I can fit in my mouth yet I can also act years older than I.  I don't have to go to any job interveiws because money isn't important.  I don't have to try to be "all grown up" because I know I am so young.  But, alas, I will  never be the little girl I once was...    And that makes me sad.  Why does one have to grow up at the age of 14?  Why must I be thrust into the world at so young?  Can't I just stay here...at my mommies side
