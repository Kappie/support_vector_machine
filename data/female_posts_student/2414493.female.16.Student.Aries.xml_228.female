Sometimes when I'm brushing my teeth and look into the mirror, I know that I'm really not up to level yet: that everything I go out and say isn't going to be witty or mind-boggling or funny, that every reflection of me isn't going to look fantastic, that I'll have my share of stumbling and tripping for the day because after all, I'm clumsy.   And then I go into lit yesterday and discover this: we're talking about the problems with the self, and Virginia Woolf offers "sensibility:" only the parts of you that you like. So you just decide to turn off when you're not brilliant. That you only live the best parts of you. I really wish I could do that. I mean, we all have our bad days...woulnd't it be perfectly lovely to erase those from our existences? And then there's the idea of "mench," or ordinary; accepting the fact that you're not going to be the greatest person day in and day out and that you should just accept.  I'm looking at my notes.  It's really easy to email Harvard people here. They're always going to email you back, and promptly. Since I'm so bent on communication, I suppose you could say that this is exactly what I'm looking for: efficient communication.  I'm really going to go read now.
