He's been sending me songs. He's just so awsome. I wanna talk to him so bad. I'm going to go tonight after band and get a calling card so I can call him. I don't care. I wanna talk to him so bad. I just miss him. I probably wont get to talk to him till tonight. It' sucks. I  love  him muchas. I  love  talking to him just because I feel so right and content when I am.      I'm at Amy's we ate casadillias for lunch. Mmm they were good. I'm wearing Tigger Slippers back to band. My feet just hurt to much.
