I was ready a little earlier than I was supposed to be so I got Patrick to just come pick me up here first before meeting Amber and Dustin at the bottom of the mountain. Ok so I do like Dustin. He's soooo sweet and he's really funny. Anywho, we went to Applebee's to eat and I got cheese sticks lol. Didn't eat all of them, but close enuf...Then we went to watch Spiderman 2...aww and Dustin was holdin my hand...that movie was pretty good...had some "Whoa!" moments...can't wait til the 3rd one comes out! *smiles*...Kisses!!! :D Monica had a bad day...and I feel really really bad for her...I hope she gets better...:( I heart her! I have a class with Adrienne so far! Like... I have...1st block with her...should be a lot of fun...we didn't have a class together last semester... :( But I'm thinkin bout changin my schedule. I talked to Brett a little while today...on the computer...onlya few minutes though..and I read his blog...aww he mentioned our dog dying..:( it was really sad...I was on the phone with him when I found out and started cryin...he doesn't care though... :) aw...well I heart you Brett, you're a great friend!
