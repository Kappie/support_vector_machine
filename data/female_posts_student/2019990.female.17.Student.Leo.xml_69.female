It may have something to do with Yearbook camp, but I'm really not sure. But as usual. I was up until 3am, hadn't finished my homework, got to school, couldn't find my homework. And of course I didn't even know my schedule. And to make things worse, the class was overfull, and I didn't get a desk, because I was late, because I didn't know my schedule.  I had an interesting dream during my nap too. I drempt that I was going as Elphaba (the wisked witch of the west) for Halloween, except i couldn't find the green face paint, and everyone left without me. We were trick or treating in this huge city too, as we stepped outside, there was this giant capitol building. That was really cool by the way. But I never got to go, because I didn't have a costume, I didn't have a hat or broom or anything. The green face paint was my costume.  I'm kind of jumping all over the place tonight, but I thought it was really interesting what Aden said about his friend turning into a druggie though. I really don't know about some of my friends, I've had alot move away, but Leila is my only childhood friend that I stil talk to. I've noticed that my friends change alot from year to year. Is that a bad thing? You know, if I do the same thing with guys, that could cause quite a problem with the whole manogomy thing. None of the people that were my friends in Kindergarten are my friends now. Granted I never had many friends through middle school up to well last year, but still I've only held on to a couple. It kind of worries me. Of course if I move to a city I might find a whole life's supply of friends, because here there's really not much to work with. But still, I hope the pattern stops. I don't think it's a healthy way to do relationships.  But anyway. I'm going to go finish my laundry and let my brother have the computer, he's been buggin me for a while. Have a happy day.
