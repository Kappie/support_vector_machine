Which brings me to the point of this blog, Procrastination is it really my fault or was i born w/ it? I think that I was born w/ the lazy mental attitude and it's not my fault. Personally i think that doctors should look into coming up w/ a cure for my unfortunate illness that i cannot cure. I cant seem to study, I want to but i feel that i'd rather be sitting here typing than studying even though 2morrow im gonna b pissed that i didnt study. As you can see I am thouroughly bored even more bored than if i would just sit down and study but for some reason i cannot do that. When i become president of the USA have full assurance that i will not only stop the war in Iraq and make sure Bush is kicked out of the US if he is not already assassinated and I will have this investigated. Thank you for you r time please comment...
