Julian, being renowned for his extreme height, was paid thirteen grand to act as one of Chewbacca's Rookies on Star Wars III, alongside Natalie Portman (hahah excuse the marketing). Thirteen grand for blowing up a tank, not one line regurtitated. Imagine how excellent it would be, if I stood that tall. I know it is unattainable *blaming genes* (only joking!), but I can dream! heheh no I thank God for who I am  utterly trust Him for who I will become =)   Oh well over it.  Opps, I guess I forgot to welcome you into my world? My little raetarded world. Hehehehe. It looks like I will be deprived of the outside society for another three weeks or so. I received my English Assessment back which was rather good considering I came second, and nothing ever is learnt in class. Yet, upon receiving this, we were handed another. On King Lear. In Nino's words,      'King Lear can ...'    hahaha no not really. But bearing in mind this assessment was literally piled onto the Economics Presentation, Economics Timeline, Database Solution, Database Presentation, Legal Studies Environmental Analysis, Religious Comparison  Legal Studies Presentation on Family Law I already have due. Eight assessments required to be accomplished by the end of three weeks *sigh* .  Funny how I get marked absent even though I am present in class. Funny how I get marked here even though I am absent from class. For example, Hume that silly boy! Convinced Mr. Hollis that I was in hospital after enduring a severe asthma attack. Although I was in fact in class all week! And if you knew Hume, he wasn't the believeable boy type! hahaha dont worry we still love you :) He brings me amusement to our Legal Studies Club: Hume, Sam  I!    FC ! hehehe dumbass - you know who you are :p And Joe! I'll get you back! It was really good to catch up with Coleen. After all she is my neighbour. Although we can be abit naughty..hahah its all outta luv! And Cheska.. that little friend of mine! Love her to bits =) Love them both to bits!   Better stop blogging before I get carried away. Oh. Keep Living the American Dream! Yes you! hahah  -- feeling *bleh* --
