Which is a bit unusual for me, because if I'm ever frustrated or upset, I never show it--the stress ends up expressing itself with me becoming ill.  Either my hormones must be re-adjusting themselves, or the move to East Bernard is finally taking its toll.  And it's hard taking care of my grandmother--one of the 15 pills she takes every day makes her need to get up like every 2 hours, so my sleep is spotty at best.  Perhaps it's the lack of a decent night's rest without interruption that's making me cranky.  And on top of all this, we lost game 1 of the college world series tonight, all because of one too many stupid errors.  On a happier note (I suppose...), I finally got a haircut today.  It used to be down to my butt, but it just got far too long and heavy.  Several months ago I cut it to my upper back, but today I got it chopped off to my shoulders and layered a bit for body.  It's just  so bloody humid  down here, and I'm also leaving for the tropics in July and New Orleans in August.  So I can't handle long hair in that kind of weather.
