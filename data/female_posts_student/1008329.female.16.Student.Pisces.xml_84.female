After, we're going to see tomb raider. I had weird dreams last night. A lot of my dreams lately have involved The White Stripes. I also dreamed that I was a ride operator, I could talk to people through a radio, and that I was always late for softball. Weird times. The other night I dreamed something so horrible and in my dream I was full-on crying. I woke up and my eyes were watering but I never had a dream effect me like so. InTeREStiNg. I'm tired. I miss Ian. :( He's going to miss the NV fair. School starts too soon and I have a conference to get my schedule on the 13th.  I have to sign up for drivers training then. JoY* I'm taking: alg2, art, his, bio, eng, and...?? It'll be great when I can drive. I'll get my license March of next year. HA--> It's weird that Ian's birthday is March 10th and mine is March 16th. AmAzinG. I can't wait for school..not. Well at least I'll be a sophomore now. I get to go off campus LEAGALLY this year. WeLL tOOdLE LOO.
