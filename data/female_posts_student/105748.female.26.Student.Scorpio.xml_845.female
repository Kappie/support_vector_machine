It reminds me somewhat of  Atlantis . Another animated film that I'm looking forward to seeing is Adam Sandler's  Eight Crazy Nights . He's a really funny guy!  Anyway, I have to do some plugs:  the official Derby Class of '96 website  (it's still up after all these years ~ I mean, I've been through chingay.com, chingay.net, no domain and goldensushi.net and it is STILL there). It's run by Ryan of  RyanandMichelle.com . He did a really good job on both websites, too!  p.s. To all you Smallville fans out there.. Have you noticed how I went from Lana Lang hair to Chloe hair? (Check out the new haircut, November 30th fresh, in the webcam! Don't mind the Blogger t-shirt which seems to be a favorite of mine lately..) Brian has a thing for Chloe! I told Man @ Planet Hair that I'm growing my hair back long after this cut, though. I think she was a bit concerned that I wouldn't be coming by to see her anytime soon, but I reassured her that I'd return for reshaping quite frequently (this cut was actually a result of the last one growing out of shape).  Brian who is a Master Cuts regular has been trying to convince me to go there for the color weave that I've been wanting.. Believe it or not I actually tried to schedule it with Man (even though Planet Hair charges $90 for just the color weave alone). Fortunately she was booked very tight so her schedule allowed time for just a haircut. I'm glad that it didn't happen because I probably would've regretted the extravagant expenditure a few days later. Brian always tells me that I really can't afford to go to the salon that I go to even though I'm convinced that I can. I think Brian's gotten a haircut from my salon only two times and one of those times I paid for it (June Filipino ball 2001: he got his hair cut and frosted, I had an updo and make-up, total cost about $150 for both of us).  For now I think my hair shall remain the same pristine black that it's always been.
