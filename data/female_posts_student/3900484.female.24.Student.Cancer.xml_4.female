I think the flashing light thing was someone pulling into my driveway. I don't know about the whole screaming thing, but I do know my neighbors were outside smoking when I motivated out of bed to check on what the heck was going on. I swear they never sleep. Someone told me they got home at about 3am once, and he (neighbor guy) was out working in his garage. Working. At 3 in the morning. I am so in need of sleep that I didn't even curse at them this morning. Trust me, they would have deserved it.  Oh and new developments. I wrote ZB a quick email to say hi and sorry I haven't seen him around much and have a nice rest of the summer (a generally friendly email). And he wrote me back. Something like INSTANTANEOUSLY. So I am not the email leper I thought I was for a while. Still haven't heard from my prof. yet. I am still checking email something like every 2 hours. Maybe I should write him again? I mean really, can you be too pushy when you want something?
