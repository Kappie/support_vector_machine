YUMMY! we also had a manicure and peticure session. kalyn is like the expert in this area, she brought an entire set of buffer, nail cutter, etc! i was rather amused when i saw what she had brought along. haha. she taught me how to go about doing this and that and it was really interesting! i painted my toe nails black and coated them with layers of glittery sparkles, bearing in mind what my lil' sis had mentioned earlier, that i don't look too good in black varnish. "too gothic." but she said that by adding the glitter, it appears much more rad. geetha and kalyn looked wicked too! ;)    Yesterday  was special. i didn't have to go to school whatsoever, hence i just watched telly and chilled at home. i saw the "ice cream show" on the discovery travel and adventure channel and i'm  amazed  by the amount of ice cream the Americans consume! it's  scary    Today  was extemely productive. the dance practice went smoothly, although the beginning of the prac was uber lame! we couldn't find a suitable spot for the dance as the juniors were using the NP room. so val decided to proceed to the FIELD! so we danced in front of the express way and the HDB flats to be ridiculed at. how corny! we practiced for a lil' while before using the NP room cos' the juniors weren't quite ready yet. you know, always make use of your time wisely, don't waste precious moments. =) we danced like dunno how many donkey times and finally ended at about 10.30am. teehee. wenta' ask mr lee math questions and offered friends and teachers the cookies which geetha, kalyn and i had baked! mr azmi thought i was going to poison him. oooh, do i look like that type of person? sigh. haha! he was pretty comical. qingrui ate it. gerry too. all my squadmates and a coupla juniors did. (they commented on how yummy it was!) mr lee was the only teacher who happily munched on it. mr azmi ah...sigh X 10000!  Afterwhich, val, sir alan and i wenta' JP to watch " Rugrats go wild! " it's sucha kick-butt movie!! i noticed that i was one of the many who laughed away throughout the entire movie cos i'm a fan of The Wild Thornberrys and i think Debby ROCKS! (although seemingly bossy) while val and alan were like stoning while i'm laughing away...haha. but overall yes, it's smashing! (hehe again, inside joke by Nigel Thornberry!) i would give it a  4/5 . =)
