I could actually feel my lack of talent, as if it were cheap clothes I was wearing inside. But, my God, how I wanted to learn, to change, to improve!    Some people have been unkind. If I say I want to grow as an actress, they look at my figure. If I say I want to develop, to learn my craft, they laugh. Somehow they don't expect me to be serious about my work.    I don't understand why people aren't a little more generous with each other.    Everybody is always tugging at you. They'd all like a sort of chunk out of you. I don't think they realize it, but it's like 'grrr do this, grr do that...' But you do want to stay intact--intact and on two feet      All by the very wonderful Marilyn Monroe  (to whom i am wishing a belated Happy Birthday, as she would have been 78 on the same day as my sister, the 1st of june)
