Lovelyboy showed up last night on his new toy (motorcycle) asked me if I wanted to go for a ride. I said sure, be right back. I needed to put on something motorcycle-ish. I think my white see through wife-beater shirt with a black bra clearly showing and tight Gap jeans did the trick. Seeing his expression only gratified my semi-slutiness. Ha! He knows I hate motorcycles, on my 19th bday I actually saw two people get thrown from one and the girl died. Ever since then I'm afraid to drive near them much less get on one. But the other day I did and it was fun. And when he picked me up on it yesterday he asked if I was afraid and I said not anymore. I don't have to talk while we ride and its so relaxing. Minus the part where we turn and I feel like I'm gonna get thrown into the street. Also, I think he likes the part where I have to hold on to him for dear life. Who knows with him, I seem to be wrong a lot. Anyways that was a quick update. Oh, and I'm proud cause when he brought me back he said okay, well I need to go all I said was k' bye be careful. He did give a couple of good hugs and stared into my eyes a couple of times, but only Lord knows if he does that to the other girl as well. I'm just gonna pretend its only for me. Pfft. whatever. (I also didn't call him, like I would have before, see, I'm really trying this time.)  Anyway, its Friday and the weekend is here once more. Thank God. Although I hate Sundays. What is everyone up to this weekend? I think I'm going to the movies (another improvement) to see "Little Black Book" or something girly like that. I don't know. Not much to say really just bored and thought I'd try and post something instead of reading everyone else's. More later.
