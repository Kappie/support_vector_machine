Perhaps this is counterintuitive, but the truth is that it is pretty unlikely people are even going to read this at all, much less that anyone who reads it would be someone I know.  So, eh, whatever.   I guess I should go, actually.  I am about to go take a final.  It is the first of my last finals.  I will be graduating in JUST FIVE DAYS.  I have been waiting for this to happen.  I cannot believe it is finally coming, after all these years.  The other day I was at a party, and someone asked me why I flunked out.  I usually try to avoid the topic these days.  I do not know why, really.  I used to be pretty open about it, but the last few years I rarely say anything.  I flunked out after the rape, but I cannot help feeling somehow as if the problem was me.  Soon, I will be a gradated person.  I wonder what that will feel like.  Me.  Graduated.  Me.
