I didn't have to grab my crotch or anything, I just pulled down my pants, andpositioned myself over the toilet. But I was too afraid I would splash all over the place, so I semi-chickened out at the beginning. So, I made it easier by starting at a sitting position and then gradually getting up! When it was over, I had a glowing sense of pride, at achieving something so extrodinary. I peed like a guy! How awesome is that? And I didn't dribble on the seat or anything. If you are female, then I urge you to give it a try! If you're male, then give me the ol' thumbs up, because I have joined the illustrious ranks of  "Pee-ers who stand" Club . YES!
