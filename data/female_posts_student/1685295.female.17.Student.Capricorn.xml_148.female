Due to this smog of death I was stricken with a headache for the rest of the goddamn day, not to mention I couldn't breathe properly because of the crap that I inhaled when I woke up. Following my usual routine, I went to the living room hardly able to see; when I got there, there was something very mushy under my feet. Dead Roaches, they were everywhere. After wearing slippers and returning to the living room, I found out that I had to clean up the house. So I then proceeded to go out into the damn sunlight and get the  kittens , damn you Summer Gypsy your damn post is stuck in my head (by the way, way to go), supplies that I needed. After clearing the living rooms of the dead, my mom proposed that we go to Jackson Heights. I unfortunately was forced to go with her, where she sprained her ankle and I had to help her (not an easy task). I not only helped from 181st to Jackson Heights, but from there to the temple in Flushing (God, I hate temples), and then back home. The only thing that I've had to eat all day is a loaf of Garlic Bread (lunch) and crappy temple food (dinner; God, I hate that damn temple). Yea, so you had a great day while mine was a piece of shit! P.S. Way to go with catching the kitten. P.P.S. Wednesday is good for me.
