It wasn't as fun as camp though, obviously, 'cause there's only 20 kids, most of whom are under the age 9. But I was team captin, so I had fun anyway. Brian was the other captain and we totally creamed him.haha. He is such a showy offy flirt. haha. Me and him took all the kids out to the play ground after we got back to play basketball and soccar and he soooo showed off the entire time. Especially when we were playing basketball. He elbowed me too and then opologized. He creamed my team that time. And then we played soccar and our gollies stunk like somethin' else.And the kids were all tired and hot, so they just stood around and it was basically me and Brian one on one. It was hecka fun. I creamed Brian that time. Oh, and I hit Jason where it hurts with the soccer ball. He got all mad at me and the other little boys were all making a big deal out of it and stuff. They acted like I aimed at his lower torso or something.I'm like, "Whatever".It was funny.   Then we went back inside and Brian sat next to methen I'd move andhe'd sit next to me agian. We drew eyes and stuff on this piece of paper and told riddles and stuff. Pretty fun. Chelsea made up this riddle about paint, and then Brian told a really lame one that was pretty funny even though it was lame. Well... I gotta go paint the kitchen. ttyl  Jak da awesomest eva
