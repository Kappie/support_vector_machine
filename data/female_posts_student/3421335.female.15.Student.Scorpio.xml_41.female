Well, that isn't necessary good all the time... What do you mean? What I mean is that a free bird does not mean it's happy Hm...you got a point... To be happy, you must know what you really want...more like what your heart really wants... I see. What if I don't know? Then you've got to find out. How do I find out? (Silence) You're on your own...
