Was sighing on his way in.   Rawa was nice. Very nice indeed lest the charges of the miscellaneous.. Serene, blue and deep.. wif shades of blue which differentiated the waters. Blooming wif rainbow fishes, Nemo look-alikes, stingray, guppy look-alikes.. Breathing thru the mask was a task.  Sparks flew.. but he who ignited the spark wasn't so fortunate afterall.  For she didn't quite appreciate the sparks flying in her direction.   Hong Kong was fine but not quite fun.  Nice scenery on Lamma.. plenty of hill climbing and ferry rides.  Expensive public transport.. nice pigeons on the dinner table..  Small, cramped up flats.. buildings so close to each other that the bamboo pole used for hanging clothes can aid in climbing over to the opposite block. Much shopping to be conquered.. That pretty much describes Hong Kong.
