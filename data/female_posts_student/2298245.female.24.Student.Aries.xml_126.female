Which is sad, in a way, because I was trapped at home with nothing to do, because all of my books were in my cold and lonely locker in Queens.  Don't feel too bad for me though.  It was a nice relaxing day.  I did grocery shopping and sat around watching a lot of TV.  But I was going to be one of the few people I know who got a five day weekend this weekend, but now everybody seems to have gotten one due to the cancellation of classes yesterday.  Wouldn't you know they would cancel class on the one day I don't have it?  So I am no longer special this weekend.  But I am at school now, doing research and reading for next week.  Have fun, and stay warm if you live in the Northeast.  It is cold out there, folks.  My face is chapped from the wind and the cold.
