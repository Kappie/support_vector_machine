It is in fact, June 30th, and this fact therefore means Incubus concert tonight, which also means that I am NOT going... anyone catching on? Yes that's right, I'm about to tears of this fact which is just a bunch of shit in its own right.    However in a brighter light, it is making me EXTREMELY anxious for Warped Tour, which is going to be AWESOME, right Tan? Ahh get excited! And we will in fact take over Hershey Park in its entirety by 12 (noon) on the day of Warped Tour... better believe it!   Blah... yes BLAH today has sucked a biiig dicky like whoa... that's right I've accomplished just about nothing... decided I was NOT making another trip to my daddys until psycho-bitch/child-abusing-16/13/12-yr-old-kid-hitter/22-yr-old-mother/SLUT-bag/etc. is gone... and so therefore tonight I'm homefree, as for this wknd... sad part though, is that I'm scheduled to work EVERYDAY this wknd... hello?! has anyone ever heard of 'The 4th of July' yanno, that BIG holiday that everyone celebrates the anniversary of our GREAT country's independence, like fireworks, food, etc... umm yeah I guess the awesome people at PG didn't... so that means... no parties Fri night for moi, no River Fireworks Sat. and NO picnics Sunday... umm yeah, def feel a sudden illness coming on, at least for Friday night anyways, because I, LACEY MARIE KAHLER do NOT miss the River Fireworks like EVER... so fuck um... :)  As for everything else that's been going on... nothing fun or exciting, this summer is beginning to blow... already... Monday however, was FUN FUN FUN... went to Empire for the day with Jaci, got my hair all did up and shitz... AWESOME... and yes it was a good day in general... Lina stayed over Monday night, fun as usual... yesterday was just blah though... worked 4:30-9... I think the schedule should say about 9:30 from now on, cause I haven't gotten out at 9 for the past like 3 wks... I hate it, as does everyone else, cannot wait til the Florida movement is permanent haha!   Alright mommy's home... time to go and find something to take my mind off of this horrible catastrophy of missing the Incubus concert :(... wish me luck ;)  Love you all!
