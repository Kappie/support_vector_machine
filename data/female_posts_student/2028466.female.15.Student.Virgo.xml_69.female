No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, wont make you cry…  Just because someone doesn’t love you the way you want them to, doesn’t mean they don’t love you with all they have...  A true friend is someone who reaches for you hand and touches your heart  The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you cant have them...  Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile  To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world…  Don’t waste your time on a man/woman, who isn’t willing to waste their time on you  Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before we meet the right one so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful ((- - - - - to all my friends who read this! I've got a good example! *ahem* me and creston...hehe...yeah, i met the wrong person, but i still havnt met the rite one! - - - - - ))  Don’t cry because its over, smile because it happened  There’s always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around  Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you to and know someone else and expect them to know you  Don’t try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to  True friends remember whatever happens, happens for a reasons  How many people actually have 8 true friends???? Hardly anyone I know! But some of us have all right friends and good friends!!!  A friend is someone who bails you out of jail – a best friend is the one sitting nex to you saying “boy was that fun”  Don’t betray an old friend, a new one isn’t worth as much  The only way to have a friend is to be one  Life without a friend is death without a witness  A friend is someone who sees through you and still enjoys the view  Friends don’t let friends drive naked!  One does not make friends, one recognizes them  I had a friend who was a clown. When he died, all his friends went in one car.
