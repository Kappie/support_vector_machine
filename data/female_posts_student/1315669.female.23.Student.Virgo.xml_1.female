And I gained 1 kg overnight...serious..no joke...  *crumples* oh well..doesn't matter doesn't it? This way i attract less attn and I wun get hurt by the most vindictive homosapiens walking this face of Earth. Tried to do some work tonight but it wasn't even vaguely successful..I'm so very tired... STILL  I wished i died..and nv woke up.....DaMn   Life still sucks...in a montonous dull wavelength that threathened the frail and deceiving stability which possessed an aura of impending spasm of trials and tribulations. I think  U guys know the reason. Life doesn't suck I do.  I'm the foe myself that i could never ever defeat. May the Lord bless my soul. Amen.
