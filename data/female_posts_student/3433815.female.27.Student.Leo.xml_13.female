I wanted everyone to know that I gave HH a proposition.. no not that you sickos!! many of you also know that both of us have not so healthy life styles so.. I proposed that if I lose 50 pounds (greatly needed to do), HH will have to quit smoking  COMPLETELY . Tell me that isn't a win win situation?! I am going to write up the proposal and everything will be documentated. When I had brought it up to HH, he was more than willing to participate. So I will be accepting any help with dieting you have, also auditioning to be my personal cheerleader, to cheer me on!!!   D uck isn't the only bad four letter word!
