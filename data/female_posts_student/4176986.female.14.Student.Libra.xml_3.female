Shes the type of friend that wouldnt bail me outta jail because she would be sittin next to me sayin damn that was fun. She always comes up with advise most the time good. Doesnt always say the right thing at the right time...but it makes things interesting. Shes a great friend.    Next theres  Sam E . well sam... shes interesting. Always ready to talk about boys and shopping. Also if i wanta get high of nail polish and see a tree sprout arms i can turn to her. Well there is no way to sum up sam so if u wanta know more about her ask me.    Ok the last friend I gonna talk about today is  Donna . Well me and donna in second grade throu like 6th grade were the best of friends we were praticaly insepriable. In like 7 and 8 grade we kinda drifted apart. We starting to become a little closer right now but no matter how far we drift apart i know donna will be there if something bad happends and i need someone there for me and i glad for that.        i will wright about other friends in other posts
