Laura and I and some more AP chem people judged the Oscar Howe Science Fair tonight.  Some of those kids had some awesome projects... then there was the guy who practically did his son's whole project... then told the kid "don't be nervous!."  If he did it himself, he probably wouldn't be bud.  But the kid was darling.  Anyway it was fun, then afterwards Laura and I walked around the halls and I gibbered about my Oscar Howe days.  Oh boy has that school changed a lot.  Not only the walls that they finally added my 5th grade year, and the new addition the year after... but teachers are gone, rooms flip-flopped around... but that library is still exactly the same... exactly.  Oh i did like school in elementary.  The building is completely different, but i can still see things exactly as they used to be in my head.   Speaking of elementary, i was debating the other night whether i wanted to counsel middle schoolers at camp this summer.  I decided against it.  At my age, elementary kids will still look up to me w/out being all snobbish.  Yes i see middle school as the time when people become completely adverse to any wisdom anyone might have for them.  Now there are exceptions i know, like Nikki, Nikki is awesome!  But for the most part... Elementary schoolers still are willing to be taught, i think we high schoolers are too... but middle school.  Here's my complete theory (i'm babbling about this i know).  Younger kids, 12 and younger, are still very impressionable.  You can talk to them intelligently, but they're not yet ready to openly defy you.  As far as camp goes, I feel like I can get through to elementary a lot better than i would with middle school... Especially with the girls.  Then when the kids hit 12... teenagerness sets in.  They become loud and slightly snobbish.  Fights break out about the stupidest things (what were all our fights about laura?  who knows.. they were ridiculous).  These are the types of kids i cannot take care of for a whole week.  Nope, then we hit high school and suddenly you're ready to not just think on your own, but think hard.  It's no longer a matter of being defiant, but of being true to yourself.  You're willing to follow the rules (as long as they're not dumb... like ID tags... what are we, homing pigeons?) and maturity finally starts to set in.  Well... in most cases, we all know those kids who are just hopeless anyway.    So back to my point, I'm going to counsel two camps.. one right after the other.  One is WorshipArtMusic (WAM) and the other is Camp Thingamajig (i know, Sarah is a corny lady).  It will be completely awesome!!  I still haven't decided where  I  want to go to camp, but it'll all work out.    Oh gee... i'm tired.  Goodnight  ~Dibith  P.S. I present my power-point tomorrow... when i was working on it, I realized i misspelled  Absalom, Absalom  every single time in my paper... oops.. oh well  P.P.S. speaking of spelling, i just ran the spell check... apparantly I have never been able to spell the word, "completely" nice hu?
