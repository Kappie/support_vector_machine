Jasmine can't go, and I honestly don't know what I'm going to do without her. I think it'll be the first time I'll actually be with the guys without her. Weird. Only John, Pyde and possibly Miller are going to be there. The Wronski's are grounded because of their grades and Richie's not answering his phone. Wronski? Bad grades? Am I supposed to act surprised? Slackers. And Richie's probably too stoned to hear the phone ring. Hehe this is fun. Anyways, Emily is sick and Jasmine is in trouble I guess, so those plans sort of went out the window. Oh well. I have like 3 hours to burn until I go over to John's. Oh boy.
