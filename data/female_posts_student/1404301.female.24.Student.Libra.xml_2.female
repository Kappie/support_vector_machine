We left the city at 11am to drive to Mount Compass, 45 min drive to stop at a little cafe where you can eat venison pie and other gourmet. 99% fat free, like kangaroos, and it is absolutely delicious!! Then, we drove a few km down south and we stop at a fishing farm. Everyone tried to fish trouts, big competition. Some people used hand line, others the usual stick (I don't remember how it is called in English!). Well, the results of the competition were as follows: Dylan caught 2 the biggest ones (2kg) - 1 with the hand line and the other with the stick Adeline caught 2 (1,9kg) (rrrr..!!) - all with the hand line Bruce caught 1 (500g)with the stick  Well, as you can see from the results, I AM THE ACTUAL WINNER OF THE COMPETITION! NA!!  Just jocking, in fact Dylan did really well, Bruce as well, and we wouldn't have caught them without the others! We came back home and stopped at Hamilton Wineries on the way to buy a couple of bottles. We ended the day with a delicious dinner at Bruce's place, we ate Fish  Chips (as you could imagine!), home recipe. We enjoyed our day very much and we look forward to go again!!
