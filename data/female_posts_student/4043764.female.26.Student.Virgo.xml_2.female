I'm sure a lot of people feel this way, so I am probably saying nothing new: I hate most meetings. Even if there is an agenda, there has to be a facilitator who can cut that shit off when it gets too unfocused. I think I spend the majority of meeting time making to do lists, thinking about what I could be doing elsewhere. Maybe I just have a problem paying attention.    And I left this DVD in britfriend's car -  urlLink City of God , I highly recommend it. Because she doesn't like driving the full distance to my house (it's maybe about 15 minutes), I have to meet her at a train station halfway between us (will take me about half an hour because I am carless). She's always late.    So I am in for a big treat today, let me tell you.
