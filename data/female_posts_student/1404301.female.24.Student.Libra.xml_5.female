Our plans are for Saturday and Sunday are as follows: Saturday - Adeline will spend her day at the Recreation and Sport Centre to pass her Level 1 Coaching - hopefully, she'll get it! Adeline's prince will probably relax and enjoy a day without his silly  smelly girlfriend! (hi hi hi!!) Sunday - Ha the BIG DAY! We are going with some friends up North from Adelaide to eat a Venison pie for lunch and to catch a trout in a farm. You pay for it before you catch it and then you cook it the way you like and enjoy it with your friends. Everyone will have one for dinner. I am quite excited to go because our friends are very nice, 100% South Australian and they enjoy telling stories about Australians.  Our friends are Bruce, Pam and their son Tom Dawson. I met Bruce at the fencing club, he is an epeist. He is a real champion and I enjoy fencing with him sometimes (even if he prefers the "crappy" weapon!) ;-)  Here are our plans for the week end, hope you'll enjoy yours...Tell me about it!
