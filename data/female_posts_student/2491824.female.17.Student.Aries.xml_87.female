And I don't think that I have talked to him since January.  He had a link to  his blog thing  in his AIM profile, so I checked it out... And the picture was like "Woah! Mohawk!" It's nice.... I want to know how long he's had it and stuff......But he has an away message up, so I won't bother him...  ....I'm a dork :) ...
