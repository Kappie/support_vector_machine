Okay, they have to have some credit that our lab isn't completely fitted out yet, but here is the list of everything that I can think of that is currently wrong with our new facilites.    where are we going to store silica?  where are we going to put paper, glass and sharps bins so that we don't trip over them?  are there distilled water taps?  are there phones in the labs?  why the hell are there gas taps on the benches and not in the fume hoods?  are the any vacuum lines, or are we going to have to continue using water aspirators?  apart from what Spencer thinks, are we really going to do distillations on the benches with the vapours getting evacuated down the litle pop up thing on the bench?  What about things that we need to distill under an inert atmosphere?  What about those lovely chemicals like benzene, TMSCl and triethylamine?  there is no where to put cylinders!!!  we need    storage for spares (x3)  nitrogen and argon next to fume hoods because I don't want to cannulate with syringes  oxygen and ozone generator next to the fumehood  somewhere to make dry ice    where is the waste solvent storage? (not downstairs Spencer, I don't know about you, but I don't want to have to walk down four flights of stairs every time I work up a reaction or use the rotor vaps)  First Aid and Safety    first aid kits  phones again  safety showers and eye wash stations  fire extinguishers  fire blankets  doors to many rooms to restrict fires     CHEMICAL STORAGE     2.1 flammable gas  3 flammable liquids  4.1 and 4.2 flammable solids  4.3 flammable soilds  5.1 oxidants  6 toxic, irritants, poisons  6 non-flammable solvents  8 corrosive - acids  8 corrosive  still pots  non hazordous materials  fridges for reagents  freezers for synthetic compounds    general and personal underbench glasswear storage  what is with having shelves out of reach over benches?  lighting is shit, expecially in offices.  If there is electrical points on desk, why can't there be overhead lights on desks?   At this rate we won't be in there til this time next year.  On a lighter note, I got 7 tips this week and won the week again, although I have to wait til Vicki gets back from leave to get my cash.
