"Highschool relationships are supposed to be both fun and meaningless. When your with Rem, your niether." So, today I am more then confused. To go for someone new, who I can be retarded with ("You're not retarded, just slower then the other kids"... lol BJ.) or to wait for a guy that I love. It's a hard decision as easy as it should be. God, Rem I hope you are not reading this. I kind of feel ridiculous for even thinking about giving up on the thought of me and Rem... its hard because I know I am impatient and that I will be a bit worried because he cheated on Lauren, and I will always be a bit self concious around him because he didnt break up with her sooner.    Can't talk right now... I just like snapped into a pseudo good mood. Later days.   .:Sam:.
