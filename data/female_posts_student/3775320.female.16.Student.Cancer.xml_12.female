       
       phlegmatic  - not easily excited or agitated; sluggish, apathetic  quiescent  - inactive, quiet  This is how I seem most of the time.  It's my mask so that people won't expect anything of me.  I don't want to disappoint so I make nothing of myself.  It's wrong but I just can't help it.  I can, but I ... can't.  It's like addiction.   You can quit - but you can't.
