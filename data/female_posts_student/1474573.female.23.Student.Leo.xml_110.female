I see ALOT of movies, i am a movie afficiando top 3 are godfather Matrix scarface  and this knocks them out of the water and that is just the THIRD installment not even the whole series. this movie should sweep the entire academy awards. I can't say more cuz its late and i have class in the morning but more will follow. Good tidings all  diane
