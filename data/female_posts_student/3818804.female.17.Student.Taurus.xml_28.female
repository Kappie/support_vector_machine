Instead, Anna, Me, Tiffany, Art, and Kevin went to Bennihannas...It was ok. I don't like it there very much but it's ok. I spend like a bunch of money for okay food...er..just don't take me there on a date. lol. But we had a nice chef and such so it was alright. Then tiff, Art, and Kevin were like...not talking to us very  much they had their own thing goin on....that kind of sucked but whatever.  Then I cam ehome to find a sink full or dishes and trash overflowing. So I washed all the dishes and took the trash out...blah. But yea I'm good just waiting for someone to talk to....  David called me today...We talked for like ten minutes or something like that but he came home early! yay! I went online on my phone while at Tiffany's house and saw like 5 messages and sure enough they were from him! lol. and I was reading them and jumping around...LOL...I was excited...I don't know why but I was... Yea but after we were about to hang up and he sort of hung up on me or something....I don't know.....lol, it was wierd. oh well  P.S. Meh...Bennihannas not so good after all...  P.S.S. I got work tomorrow!!! lol... and Vegas August 5-10
