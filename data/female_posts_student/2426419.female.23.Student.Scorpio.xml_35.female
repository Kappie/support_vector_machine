Insider trading scandals have become all too commonplace in the business world these days and a recent trade in Major League baseball may just be the most unethical of them all.  It has long been an unwritten rule that teams not trade players within their own division; but Chicago and Pittsburgh chose to ignore that rule when the Pirates sent Kenny Lofton, Aramis Ramirez, and Randall Simon(all starters) to the Cubs for a few minor league no-names.  This apalling trade has resulted in the Cubs making it to the N. L. Championship series, leaving more honest teams (e.g. Cardinals) home for the playoffs.  Add the fact that Cubs manager Dusty Baker was found guilty of tax evasion last year and you have pretty solid evidence that the Chicago Cubs are nothing but a fraud.  In the business world, the CEO's of fraudulant companies are sent to prison and must pay a hefty fine.  I understand that this is only baseball, so the following are my proposals to remedy this situation. 1) Since the Pirates and Cubs like one another so much, merge the two teams and call them the Chigittsburgh Cubirates.  2)  The Cubs must forfeit all games following the trade, allowing the St. Louis Cardinals to take their place in the playoffs. 3)  Eliminate both the Cubs and Pirates, sending Mark Prior (Pryor?), Kerry Wood and Moises Alou to the Cardinals and moving all others to the Memphis Chicks AAA Team.  Thank you and GO CARDS!!!!!next year.
