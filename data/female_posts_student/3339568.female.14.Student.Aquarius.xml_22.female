The murder was only recently solved, 25yrs after the crime. It was narrated bi her, in the past tense. And there was present tense, the investigation and stuff, and flashbacks. And the movie ended with her saying, "I would be 42 if I was alive now, I would be married and have children of my own. Imagine that...." It really tugged at my heart strings. I almost cried, and i neva cry in movies. I suggest everyone watch it. It's called "Murder in Greenwich" You can borrow it from me if you want. Click on the link and you can find out more about Martha. I'm still sad about it. Why does murder happen? It's so - unjust. And horrible. It's hard to imagine how one split second action can change our lives forever...
