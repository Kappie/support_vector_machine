My score prediction: 1100 and under.  And here is the brilliant part of my day: I GOT ALL A'S ON MY REPORT CARD!!!!! FOR 6WKS AND TRI!!!!!  This is something i haven't done since......well so long that i can't remember.  I've always been pretty much an A-B student because of stupid math.  Who has gold renaissance? i have gold renaissance!  its awesome, made the whole day alot better.    Dude, everyone is getting married lately.  I've been invited to 2 weddings in the past month.  Lisa (the secretary at my dad's office and one of my friends when i worked there) and Clark (her boyfriend of about 2 years and fiance) are getting married on April 10th.  I'm possibly missing the City Semi-finals for her wedding, but i might be able to go considering that her church is literally right next door to the Frisco DPSC.  Vivian (another friend from my dad's office) and Brad (her high school sweetheart from when she went to Coppell High School back in 90-something) are getting married on July 24th.  its crazy, i'm going to be broke!  oh well, its cool.  Just in case any of you kids were wondering, i've got the playoff schedule for the remainder of the Coppell Hockey season.....in which if we go to State, we might take it all home for the second time in a row on my birthday!!!! April 18th in case you wanted to know.  Alright here's how the rest of the season goes:  Regular Season: * vs. Jesuit - Valley Ranch DPSC, 9:30pm, 3/11  * vs. Marcus - Valley Ranch, 8pm, 3/18  * vs. Flower Mound - Valley Ranch, 8pm, 3/25  Playoff Season (here's where it counts): * Section Semi-Finals: 3/30, Valley Ranch, 7pm  * Section Finals: 4/6, Valley Ranch, 8:30pm (i predict Jesuit) * Section Championship: 4/8, Valley Ranch, 7pm  * City Semi-Finals: 4/10, Frisco DPSC, 3pm  * Metroplex 3rd place: 4/13, 7pm, Frisco  * Metroplex Championship: 4/13, 8:30pm Frisco  * State Championship: April 16th-18th in Frisco, there are no times yet.  Pretty much its like quarterfinals on the 16th, semis on the 17th and the big game on the 18th which is where one team will take it all home, hopefully Coppell ****Remember, whether we win metroplex or not, we still go to state....i almost hope that we don't because Southlake did that and look where they ended up.  Alright and now its time for friend story of the week: the late edition:   Liz Whiting, the Great One  I met Liz in second tri, third period of Masengill's PreAp geography class freshman year.  I had recently broke it off with most of my friends from west because i didn't really like the way they were treating me, so i was kinda still vulnerable and a little intimidated by people which is not normal for me.  Liz sat behind me and i noticed that she was rather loud like me.  I would always turn around to talk to Jessica and Liz would always say something "mean" to me and make me turn back around.  I didn't realize this was the way her sense of humor worked so i thought she was this really bitchy girl.  Slowly but surely though, we became pretty close friends in that class.  Me and her had so many inside jokes together from lunch that every time somebody said something, it was one of our jokes and we'd laugh for several minutes uncontrollably.  Our famous one was the "working-the-nightshift-and seducing-niko-kapanen-for-dallas-stars-tickets-and-access-to-their-locker-rooms" running joke which still lives on today.  It all started when me and Sarah were joking around about seducing Prince William to take out Prince Charles so Wills could be King....long story, don't ask.  Then we told Liz and it quickly evolved into what would happen if we seduced Niko for dallas stars tickets and access to the locker rooms and then it got corrupted even more when we started talking about seducing coppell hockey players for access to their locker rooms.  it was really really funny and we'd laugh at everything that reminded us of it and masengill would always ask us if we were on crack....which sometimes i wonder if unknowingly we were.  We also formed "The Nikettes" which were the fanclub of Niko.....when actually i was the only one that really knew what he looked like.  Liz and I also had the best moment of glory EVER for anyone in that high school at lunch.  We danced in the store at lunch.  Yes, thats right, the song "Working at the Car Wash" came on and we started disco dancing with our sweet tarts and rollos in front of EVERYONE.  even some hot guys.  That was our famous moment at lunch, after that they never played the song again in the store but people remembered us for that.  Me and Liz never did a project together or anything for that class....we just sat around at lunch and made dirty jokes like the nightshift one, puberty stricken black guy, what happens when a guy crosses his legs (illustrated by isaac), "convincing" isaac to show us his package (that was so liz, not me lol) and so on and so forth.  When me and Liz get together, leave the room if you get grossed out too easily.  Alright so on with the story.  Over Spring Break last year, Liz, me and Sarah all came over to my house and stayed up for 36 hours in a row.  It was our acheivement of the night.  Me and Liz took coke bottles and walked around my neighbourhood and to Chuan's house acting like we were drunk.  We toasted to everything that walked.  Chuan wasn't there so we came back to my house and made our "Whats Kapanen?" shirts in honor of our second tri together.  "Whats Kapanen" is another one of our famous jokes along with coffee!, el liz-o, el duane-o, WHM club, we own finland, we love the 80's etc.  So our shirts were all painted and we had to finish them that night because Sarah had to leave at the crack of dawn (aka 10pm) the next morning.  We finished our shirts, took a 30 MINUTE power nap and then walked the mile to McDonalds from my house at 7:30 to get some food.  We almost got run over twice and we felt sick eating all that food on the way back.  People, again, probably thought we were drunk or had hangovers because we looked like it.  We also knew that Randy Andy aka Andrew Gabel lived in my neighbourhood somewhere so we went up and down the streets singing "Oh Canada" at the top of our lungs.  Thats how tight me and Liz are, we do stupid things together and tell everyone how stupid we were.  We also "wrapped" Masengill's house when his baby was born....that was fun.  I love Liz, my nirvana lol, to death and i don't know what i'd do without her!  She brought out the extreme stupidity and inner drunkiness in me and now we're always really really incompetent together.  She is the Great One and i love her forever!!!  remember the freshman year Liz, it will never die, lol!  Alright kids, girl scout cookies call my name and i must eat them.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
