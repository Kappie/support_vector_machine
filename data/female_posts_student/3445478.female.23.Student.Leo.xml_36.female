G'ma Lu was laughing like crazy and having so much fun with Nick. I took KeKe to the Hacienda Del Sol-My favorite place to eat-while my mom and Billy went to his parents to visit. Keke ordered hot chocolate and beans! ;) Yep...Beans! That's it! Awesome combination Keely! We had a blast! This afternoon was beautiful. Nick and I walked down to the lakewalk and over to 21st and back up home. It felt good to work up a sweat!
