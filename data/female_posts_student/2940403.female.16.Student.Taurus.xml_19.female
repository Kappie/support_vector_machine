Her deep breaths made a rattling sound deep in her throat as she tried to breathe in through her clogged nose.  Poor kitty with a cold.  I then took a shower, and went through my morning routine half awake.  Then drove to school, and walked 5-10 minutes to the school from the Community parking lot up the hill.  I started my new class today, Survey Art C.  I'm glad I was able to switch from that shit dance class, except when I learn from Courtney that they made new rules stating that you need at least three trimesters of Performing Arts.  What total bullshit.  I want to take the kind of classes that interest me, not what my peers want me to take.  They don't know me, and don't know where I want to go or where I am going in life.  And I can tell you, dance classes will not change my outlook on who I want to be.  Then I went to second hour Math, to have to get shit from my recently-married teacher.  What a grouch.  Then my shit third hour History, where I know very few people and the rest are vainglorious and annoying as all hell.  I have to say that my worst class today had to be Math, though.  I was talking to JT, who just happens to be another Democrat (woo!) and we have lots of good conversations regarding Bush and his shit administration.  While we were discussing our political beliefs, Lance kept making moronic comments and mocking us.  He would say that Bush was great, but he never had anything to back up his opinion.  So JT and I would inform him of what his faults are, and he'd continue to be thick, saying that Bush was the best.  All I can do anymore is shake my head in frustration and mumble under my breath, "Don't you love our generation?" ::rolls eyes::  I'm not entirely against anyone who might support Bush, because people have rights to their own opinions, just as much as I have my right to support Kerry.  What bothers me most is when kids my own age laugh about it and say that Bush is the best, and that the war in Iraq is 'totally awesome,' or they even go as far as to mock Iraqis and people of Middle Eastern cultures and run around in circles screaming about bombs.  It's disgusting, and I fear for when these people will be holding higher offices in our future, making our decisions on whether we go to war or not, and what is important to the true American society.  Makes you think, doesn't it?   ::sigh:: Don't you love our generation?   Here's a fun activity that will only take a minute or two.    Go to www.google.com, type in 'miserable failure,' then click 'I feel lucky'    See what happens!
