The Arendales' oldest daughter Katy was supposed to fly in yesterday, but she got there "late" (an hour before her flight) and they gave her seat away. But she got to fly first class today, so that's good.   Lesse, what did I do yesterday?...Taught Dad how to upload pictures with  urlLink Hello  from Picasa, so he's been having fun posting pictures. All day I pretty much just hung out in various outdoorsy places and edited the manuscript of a fanfic I'm writing. Tanning and editing at once...I  can  multitask!   urlLink SHAMELESS PLUG SHAMELESS PLUG   Sorry; had to do that...  But I did go swimming at one point, with Lizzie n' Ben n' Avery. OK, I know I definitely spelled Avery wrong...Hey, her stuff's right over there. Lemme see if she's got her name on any of it.  *goes through Avery's stuff*  Ah-ha. It IS Avery! Score one for me!  We had green enchiladas for lunch yesterday, which is worth mentioning because they're So Freakin' Good. A wee bit spicy, but hey, I like spicy. I ate three. ;-) I think that was before I went swimming...but I don't remember. Who cares? There's no schedule here.  Dad's been trying to get everyone set up for their classes and whatnot. He's got Ben all scheduled for guitar lessons, but Lizzie and I are still in the dark. I'm trying to get into a private creative writing session (whoo, big surprise there) and Lizzie wants to do jewelrymaking or something. She's only gonna be here till Wednesday...huge bummer. :-(  Dad also decided that we're going to have "Christmas in July"...or, as he calls it,  "Feliz Navidad en Julio."  Notice that he always says  feliz  Navidad, so it's actually "Merry Christmas in July." Again with the whole "I'm too relaxed to care" business...  Well, apparently, it works like this: Tonight, or sometime soon, we each draw an envelope that contains a small amount of money and a person's name. We use the money to buy the person a gift, wrap 'em all up, and have 'Christmas' on the sixth. Hey, it works for me. (Note: For whoever gets me, I appreciate gifts that I can eat.) I have no idea what I'll buy no matter who I pick, but that's alright. The market's got lotsa variety.  What else? Hm...Oh, yes. Last night around eight-thirty or nine, Alafair (that is how you pronounce it; PLEASE don't ask me how to spell it) and Ben were going out to Charrock (spelling?...), a bar down near the Jardin. They invited me to go, because...well, I don't know. But we went, and I sat around on the third floor with all of the crazy drunk college people, listening to Pink Floyd and trying not to look bored. I did try a sip of beer, since it was two-for-one night on everything, and I actually liked it. But because I liked it, I didn't drink any more. Does that make sense? Not really, but there you go.  So the college folks drank and were stupid and drank and got stupider, and I watched the lightning off in the distance and the fireworks that someone shot off at one point. Our "group" was a dozen people at four of those little round tables set down in a row, and they christened one the  Isla de las Cervezas:  the Island of Beer. Every time someone emptied a bottle, it would be "dubbed" as a famous person and placed in the appropriate geographic location on the island. I couldn't possibly remember them all, but they included: Dave Letterman, Robert E. Lee, George Bush Sr., Michael Jackson, Fidel Castro, Jim Morris, Howard Taft, Chewbaca (the big hairy brown thing [Wookie] from  Star Wars ), Napoleon, and (the one I named even though I didn't actually drink the beer) Elvis Presley.  But for me, the evening was really boring. People just drank and smoked and talked politics that were way over my head, and all the smoke gave me a headache. I did get beer spilled all over my leather sandals, but I didn't really care; I've had experience with leather sandals and they can take serious liquid damage. But I decided to leave at ten because I was just bored...and had that headache. Ben escorted me home, and I went up on the roof and hung out with Laura and Lyda (Lida? Laida? Lie-Dah?) for awhile before going to bed. And that was yesterday.  Today! Woke up, ate breakfast with  la familia , showered, met Katy when she showed up, and edited part of some legal thing for Mr. Arendale. I have to finish editing that, actually...it's open down here on my menu. He gave me my first-ever editing advance of 50 pesos. Additionally, Mrs. Arendale promised me last night that she would throw me my first bookstore signing party whenever I put out my first novel. Add that to the fact that I'm slated to get in touch with a couple of people's friends and relatives who are writers/majoring in creative writing, and you might as well just give me my Pulitzer Prize right now and call it a day.   I'm joking, of course, but this is the first time I've ever been taken seriously with this whole writing thing. I like it. *basks in all the glorious head-inflating compliments*   But enough about me--let's talk about San Miguel! I think I summarized it best when talking to Jessica online last night, so I'll be even more egotistical and quote myself. She asked, "So what's it like down there?" and this is the only way to answer that:   "Freakin' awesome. Weather's perfect, house is gorgeous, food is excellent, schedule is nonexistent, everything's cheap and you're 21 whenever you want to be."   Seriously. This place is the best thing to ever happen to me. I feel like a different person here; it's home and better than home because I'm actually happy and content. I'd just chalk it up to the fact that here, your biggest concern is trying to decide which of the numerous beautiful places you're going to relax...but there's something else, too. I don't know. The atmosphere, I guess. I know for a fact that I never would've even considered going out to a bar in Lake Jackson or Houston, not because I'm morally opposed to it, but because I just didn't have the self-confidence. And while I didn't have a 'good time' last night, I didn't have a bad time, either, and I'm glad I went. It was interesting. And I got B33R!  I can't put my finger on what I'm trying to say. I just...Here, I'm so much closer to being the person I've always seen inside myself than I've ever been before. It's like my soul is being rejuvenated just as much as my body. (Which I am trying to tan, by the way. I mean, it probably won't do much, but as long as you can't see every single vein that's even vaguely near the surface of my skin. I'm creepy-crazy-pasty-white, and I don't like it.)  But seriously. This place is...awesome. Awesome awesome awesome. And I think I'm gonna stop now, cuz I do have to finish editing Bruce's thingamabobber, and then I'm gonna keep editing that manuscript I mentioned. And then I'm gonna...Aww, heck, who knows or cares? You don't make  plans  here.   End of Post...
