I have a kick ass job and I'm just doing the whole teenager thing like chilling with my friends and drinking a lot and nt doing what I should be doing. I need to be doing summer reading and start work on college applications, but I haven't even finalized my college list. I thought I made up my mind but new ideas keep on popping up in my head and it confuses me so much that I don't even know direction I'm going to take my life. For the past four years the plan for me has been to go to college and then go to law school and become a lawyer. This has been the plan, but I don't know if I like this plan . There is something about that seems just too mudane and not the life that is truly me. I'm seek of the boring and the predictable and I want to become someone different and cool, but I guess that is every seventeen year old's and me saying that shows how boring and predictable I really am. I have such conflicting ideas about college, that center around my major, the types of people I want to meet, and my possibe carrer path. I have small liberal arts colleges to large Big 10 schools on my list. The List is forever shricking and expanding, also every school I want to go to for a completely different reason, person, or cause. This whole college thing is slowly giving me a headache and I can't believe that it is almost Septmeber and that is when the real drama is truly going to begin. Thank God I already made the choice not to apply early.
