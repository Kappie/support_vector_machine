I think I probably spent too much money, but sometimes you just need to spend a little on yourself...that doesn't really make sense considering most of my money is spent on myself, but I think most of my money goes to movie tickets, food, and other little things like that which I usually don't think about.  I bought myself a CD, Dilate :) I've been wanting that for an extremely long time but for some reason have never bought it.  So now I have 15 of Ani's CDs. Obsessed? Me? Never.  And I bought a new bag for school, it's the best bag in the world. Seriously.  From Anima's...so it smells nice too.   I'm painting a picture, I'd say I'm almost done, but it's still missing something and I have yet to decide what that is.  I'm slightly proud of it but I'm sure soon enough I'll wake up, look at it, and decide it's ugly.   I was planning on reading in Wheeler park today...but for some reason that didn't happen...whoops.  I really need to read my book.  Tomorrow.    I'm exciting...
