To crack a walnut, you must be sneaky... Not all walnuts have the same shell-smashing withstanding capacity (sswc to be short). To test this capacity, lightly tap the walnut on the desk to see if minimal pressure produces any crackage. If it does, than your in luck! You may be able to crack the walnut in under five minutes. If the walnut fails to produce even the littlest of cracks, I would recommend that you move on to step two; that is, to lodge the walnut in between your desk drawer and your desk.   Shoving forcefully with your palm upwards, begin to drum the drawer into the desk. Hopefully, this action will cause your walnut to begin cracking and/or to crack completely!  (Watch out for flying pieces of walnut shells. I recommend you wear protective goggles at this point.)  Sadly, this procedure has been known to fail. If you find yourself at a breaking point, and have only cracked a total of two walnut shells in the past 30 minutes, I suggest that you move on to step three.  Look around you- are there any "mini-crow bars" nearby? If so, begin to wedge the edges of the walnut open slowly. I think you will find the mini-crow bars to be very effective. When unable to wedge the walnut open gently, change your method slightly to incorporate large amounts of pounding. That usually does the trick.   WARNING: Walnuts contain small pieces that are a choking hazard for people of all ages. Make sure to completely chew your walnut before swallowing.   Wasn't that an awesome tutorial? I mean, not even the "Dummy's Guide to Dummy's Guides" could come up with something as good as that one. Really though, I have to thank Arturo for the inspiration. He was the one, after all, who was having problems with walnuts last night.    I leave you with this... "You raise my satisfaction with life up to ten times it's original height only to send it hurdling back down again, where it implodes upon impact. You then pour water on it and do you know what's left? A hot steaming pile of cold black ashes."
