However, Vicki doesn't have her keys, so I can't collect my winnings :(  She did in fact give me a talking to because of the Advance Medicinal Exam incident.  Apparently Peter Scammels told us last year that we weren't meant to take our exams with us.  But if he had told me that, I wouldn't of taken it, so he obviously forgot (I'm trying to be gracious - but now I won't).  So, I gave all of my honours notes to Sammi to help him study, which just so happened to include the Medicinal Exam, which just so happened to be the same exam this year because those morons over at VCP were too lazy to write two exams or to even write on the front of ours that we were to leave them, like is standard procedure at Melbourne.  Bloody Monash morons.  Anyway, I'm a little riled up about this because when I went to get my winnings from Vicki she told me to come in and close the door in an ominous voice and I thought that she was going to accuse me of something much more sinister.... not that I have done anything more sinister ;p  Made lifetime membership at weight watchers today.  Don't have any good after photos yet, but  urlLink here's  a before one.
