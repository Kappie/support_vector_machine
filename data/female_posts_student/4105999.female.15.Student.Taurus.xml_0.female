They brought Lauren, Kelseys 4 year old sister. Im gonna be babysitting Lauren next wednesday morning.. that girls so cute me and Lauren watched full house while kels and my sister hung out until 6. Then i went to vbs with lin and kels. Lauren wanted to come too but wed have to get her car seat and stuff and her mom said maybe enough time when we had more time to get it all in..so i told herr she can come over whenever im home and i will hang out with her. lol..well vacation bible school was uhh interesting lol...lots of hard work ill just say..ud think working with the 2's and 3's would be easy not when it takes like 4 adults in there along iwth like 7 kids just to keep them under control..there fun tho.. they just get out every little thing possible. it was cute tho cuz all the kids were trying to help clean up today tho when it was over. we got to make pciture frames haha. Then when i got home i talked to amanda on the phone for TWO HOURS  until about 11 or 11:30..lol that was fun we just talked about who shes inviting to her 16th birthday..then i called emily and told her an interesting story about vbs..and that was my day, Now i just finished working on my webshots picture thing and getting ready to work on my buddy profile well imma go!!!
