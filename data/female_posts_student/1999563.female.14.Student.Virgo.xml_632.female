Hahha. I don't have much else to say except..  I told Karsen the wrong way to work our shower. Hahhahaha. I feel SOO bad. I told her the wrong directions. I told her to push the handel to the left for hot and to the right for cold, but it's the oppisite!! :( I hope she is okay...   I hope you all have fun while i'm gone!! I'm gonna misss youuu!
