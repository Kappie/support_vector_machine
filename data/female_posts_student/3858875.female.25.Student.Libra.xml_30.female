If you click on that 'comments' link, you can say whatever you please without being anon or a blogger member. i apologize in advance for the little ads there - it's a free service.   thanks, will, for alerting me to the comments issue.   in the meantime, my linking abilities have disappeared. i hope it's not a result of hooking up to haloscan.
