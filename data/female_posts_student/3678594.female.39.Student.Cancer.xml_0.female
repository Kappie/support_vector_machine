All was going well until I ran across a Nigella forum ...... a couple of hours later, I'm still egrossed in the forum, my pen idle and my paper blank.    I would feel a bit guilty about frittering away the morning if I didn't adore Nigella Lawson. I am thrilled, quite frankly, to find this wonderful forum, not only because I can chat with others who adore Nigella, too, but also because the site posts some of the recipes from her books that I am not lucky enough to own at present.    Of Nigella's cookbooks, I own three: How To Eat, How To Be A Domestic Goddess, and Forever Summer. I actually have two copies of HTBADG - both paperback and hardcover. I purchased the paperback copy just recently. My reasoning being that the hardcover edition, along with FS, is packed away with most of my cookbooks at my house in Ontario and I don't have access to it at the moment. I justify my actions with the rationale that when I do get all my books shipped here, I can give the paperback copy to my cousin.     When you are a compulsive cookbook addict, any little excuse will do. Hehe.    I am now looking forward to getting Nigella Bites and her new book, Feast, which is coming out this September.    If you love Nigella as much as I do, check out her great forum -  urlLink Nigella's Kitchen .
