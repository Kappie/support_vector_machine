My mom and Emily just went on a walk so now I'm home alone. Why would anyone want to go on a walk in Prospect? I would be afraid that I would be molested by the perverts at the bar or something.  I like Allister. They are a good band. I'm listening to them right now.  I have SATs on Saturday. I'm nervous. I hope there's someone there that I know.  Prom is Saturday. It should be fun. I'm going back to Mike's house after prom. That should be awesome.  I'm looking in Oneonta College. It doesn't cost much and I could come home on weekends. That would be really cool. Plus they have the 2 things I want to do with my life. Music and Phsycology. Weird combination huh?   I've got green permanent marker on my arm from study hall today thanks to Ned.  And I'd also like to add a congrats to Gavin for  finally  getting his car on the road.   Speaking of cars...I'm going to apply at Wards this summer so I can buy a car. Hopefully a cool one. Maybe I can find a used Mini Cooper. That would be friggen awesome. I love Mini Coopers!  Wow, I'm messed up. Well, that's all for now. Maybe more later (?).  Song: I'm writing this song to tell you that I'm sorry Because I know you never thought that I'd be away so long I know its unfair to ask for you to wait for me But I don't have a real job and youre ready to move on  And its hard to keep my balance when you look the other way So I'm letting go with every breath I take in  So many reasons I need something more to believe in The time has come to turn and walk away Through all these changes, mistakes There was time now its too late There's nothing more that I could say to you  I'm writing this song to tell you that its over Your jealously took you way too far this time Another day comes, I'm better off without you So now take a deep breath and get on with our lives  And its hard to keep my balance when you look the other way So I'm letting go with every breath I take in  So many reasons I need something more to believe in The time has come to turn and walk away Through all these changes, mistakes There was time now its too late There's nothing more that I could say to you   So what good is today If there's not gunna be a tomorrow?  It's too much for me to take I know you don't wait forever  Just remember that life without us won't be the same   So many reasons I need something more to believe in The time has come to turn and walk away Through all these changes, mistakes There was time now its too late There's nothing more that I could say to you - Better Late Than Forever - Allister
