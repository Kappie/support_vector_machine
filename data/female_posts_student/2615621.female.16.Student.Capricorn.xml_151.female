Today i went to church for the last time in tenn. yays. my hottie wasnt sitting beside me..dammit. lol then i changed into my pink and black converses and wanted skater shirt and kept the black skirt w/pink dots on..i looked like some skater chick. i then went out to pick up skaters. lol  I just got off the phone with mom and she fuckin pissed me off. she was talking to me and my grandparents and john were sitting there waiting for her to get off the phone. i asked her about the concert and she TOTALLY played stupid in front of them and said how she forgot and i said "well u do know im missing the one here to come home" and shes like "We'll talk about it, but i cant compromise over a concert" WTF DOES THAT MEAN?! hello. she fuckin pissed me off. she NEVER tells me yes in front of other fucking people and when she goes say yes she acts like i forced her too. well im not compromising with this damn concert either bitch.   Anyways..many exciting things happened today, but im just too damn lazy to type it all...oh and i hung out at some rock stars house LMAO hes on tour with Josh Rouse in Europe, his name is Curt Pirkens. He was in some band called Stella for a long time and then went solo. His cd was number 1 in europe for like 3 months straight. yay curt. i hung out with his cat and listened to his cds...his dad and my dad are good friends...that would explain why i was in his house haha.   *much love and fondu*
