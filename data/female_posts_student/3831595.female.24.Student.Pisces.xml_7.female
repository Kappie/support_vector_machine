And the stupid thing isn't even actually in the apartment!  So I had to pick my dad up at the airport yesterday.  I saw something interesting while I waited for him: An old lady chased her suitcase all the way around the baggage claim.  Seriously, she went around it and then some.  Why didn't she just stay in one place and wait for it to come to her?  I could have helped her. But I didn't.  On that note, I shall go to bed.  Gotta rest up for the alterations brawl tomorrow.  Oh, and HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAVE AND STEPHANIE!!!!!
