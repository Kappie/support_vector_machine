Sadly after school on wednesday i have to drive to bradford aka the hic capitol of the world aka bumble fuck. Its a seven hour drive and we're leaving at three o'clock in the afternoon, how much does that suck? Very much. Yeah so while i'm in the black hole that is Bradford PA, i won't be able to undate here. So from Wednesday to Sunday no updates, sorry kids. On a brighter note i spent an entire period on friday talking to DTL aka the guy i am like in love with (ps dont try to figure out who it is, those aren't his (or her) real initials) lol anywho it was amazing. alright more to come but now i have to pick up my sis from school
