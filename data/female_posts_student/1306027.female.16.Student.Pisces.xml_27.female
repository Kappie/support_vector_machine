I got to do my first real driving yesterday- without crashing the car. WOOHOO~!. Im so proud. My father, however, was left with more than one white hair after that ordeal. You see- I tend to drift to the center while making my turns, and I tend to take them fast(well if you call 15mph fast...). It was an almost abandoned parking lot near a taco bell. My father was definately sweatin it though- he acted like I was going to careen into a curb going 50.    Driving is fun, learning about it isn't.  The classes I have to take are 3 hours long! Plus- the driving school isn't all that nice either. Were talking- metal folding chairs. Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is to sit in a metal folding chair for three hours?! I didn't until I started drivers ed. I also didn't know people get impalled by guard rails almost everyday.    Last night's class was especially unbearable.  Why? Because of the morons in the back of the class chanting my name. I ignored them- which seemed to edge them on to further chanting. What was the deal??"The world is populated by multiples of stupid people" I told myself. I then began having daydreams of groups of half-witted idiots running into parked cars and I felt much better.  So- Im bored.  It's friday and I have absolutely nothing to do. Maybe I will blog several times today... who knows?!
