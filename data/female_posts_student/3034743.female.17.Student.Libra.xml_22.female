Tomorrow I have to go to my uncle's bday party or whatever. I swear, people in Lake Oswego have too many parties. They aren't even fun. I don't really like my dad's side of the family too much. They all have their noses in the air. Whatever. The only one I really like is my cousin Andy. He's cool and only 4 months older than me. He's a senior. He's going to go to the college that I want to go to (PSU). Marty and Josh think I should go somewhere better...but PSU is close to home. I don't want to go somewhere too far away. I dunno. I have a lot of things to decide. Oh well. Damn, I still have some homework to do. I procrastinate too much...
