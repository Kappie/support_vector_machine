All you have to do is look straight and see the road, and when you see it, don’t sit looking at it –walk.”   ~ Ayn Rand    Morals; motivation based on ideas of right and wrong. Ethics; A set of principles of right conduct. In my life I have made some mistakes.  I have lived immorally, treated myself like shit, given in to temptation on more than one occasion, and not always followed the word of God.  So I suppose you could say that while I do now have a sense of moral and ethical right and wrong in my own mind and within my chosen actions, that hasn’t always been so.  However, since gaining that strong sense of my own moral mind I have grown very aware of how each and every action will affect my moral beliefs.  I am unwilling to compromise!  Okay let me get on with it, most recently I have been asked to do something that I felt was morally and ethically wrong.  The obvious answer to the question would be no, except in this case it took some thought.  In this case, violating my own moral beliefs would have given a friend the opportunity to live a better life and get a better job.  Violating my own moral beliefs would have seen that she could make more money, get some much needed insurance, and generally be a happier person.  All of these being true, I had to put a great deal of thought into this particular predicament.   When is it right to knowingly and with forethought violate your own moral and ethical beliefs?  I personally believe that the answer to this question is, never.  I personally believe that if you pick and choose what to spend and break your morality on, you will loose a sense of why you adhere to morals at all.  In the case of my friend, I decided that I would not do her that favor she required to make her life better.  I know it may sound cruel, but I choose to adhere to my morals.  If she had lived her life in correlation with her own morals and ethics –or even knew what she morally believed for that matter- then she wouldn’t have been in the predicament to begin with.  If she had lived by mans law, or in accordance with her own health and safety, she wouldn’t have been in that predicament.  So in the end it came down to weather or not I was willing to give in and break my morals to make up for a series of bad choices on her part.    Another problem was, once I cut through all the bullshit, that I knew that if I did this one favor for her, if I helped her out, nothing would change.  She would go on doing that thing that got her into the predicament to begin with, and other lives could suffer for her problem.  Again I was unwilling to risk others for her problem.    In the end I said no to helping her, and hopefully she will not ask me again in the future.  Still I hope that our friendship has not been strained by this decision, if it has and she is unwilling to understand that I had to do what I thought was ethically right, then perhaps she was not the friend I believed her to be in the first place.  ~Kristyn
