Brandon and I were just talking about having a healthy fear of God during one of our talks in the gazebo at Church Camp, so this reading is timely.  This subject has perplexed me for a while, because as His child, I no longer have to fear condemnation (Romans 8:1).  So why should I still fear God?  I think what God is saying through this passage is that I should have an increased  awareness  of God, knowing that all that I do/think is made plain before Him (Hebrews 4:13).  Apostle Paul knew that he would someday have to "appear before the judgement seat of Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:10), as will I someday.  I will be judgemed so that I "may receive what is due for the things (I) have done in the body, whether good or bad". This awareness of God's omnicience and impending judgement should translate into a turning away from sin.  I suppose, then, that a fear of the Lord is not a fear of His wrath, but a feeling of awe of God's HOLINESS and an awareness of His constant presence.    Do I really see God as a Holy God, awesome and mighty, or do I see him as a benevolent Father who will look the other way when daddy's girl is doing something naughty?  As Henry Blackaby says in his book _Experiencing God_, we are taught  not  to fear.  God is portrayed in Sunday School as soft and loving and as our "best friend". As a result, I have become complacent in my sin.  It's not that God is stern and cold, of course, but I need to have a proper perception of His Holiness.    A reverence for God will dramatically alter the way I worship and how I live my life.  God will be much BIGGER to me if I see Him as the mighty, all-knowing God that He is.  God will become bigger and I will necessarily become smaller in perspective.  A deep sense of awe of God will change my life because I will no longer limit Him in my prayers.  I often pray for things that I think are "do-able", like granting safety on a trip, that a friend will find a job, or enhancing my relationship with Brandon.  Rarely do I pray for someone to be healed from a chronic illness or for our government--things I don't have control over and seem impossible to change.  As the song goes, God really is bigger than the Boggieman.  If I start seeing God as bigger and more awesome, then I will start praying bigger prayers.  The bigger prayers I pray, the more miraculous the answers will be.    Lord, you really are bigger than my view of you right now.  I often limit you to what I think You are able to accomplish, but I now realize that you are able to do much more than I could ever dream.  Lord, you ARE able.  You have searched me and you know me (Psalms 139:1).  This both gives me great comfort, and also heightens my conscience because I know you are constantly watching me.    You are so much more than a benevolent grandfather--You are the creator of the Heavens and the earth and you have the power to create as well as to destroy.  You were that burning bush to Moses and the pillar of fire to the Egyptians.  You parted the sea so they could cross and send them manna and quail from heaven every day.  You FIGHT for me, and I only need to be still (Exodus 14:14).  You are awesome and powerful and I can ask for anything in Your name. Forgive me for being complacent in my sin and taking advantage of Your grace.  I want to see You as You really are--HOLY. Amen.    Prayer Requests:  1)Sue needs a night guard--pray that her insurance will conver the cost or that she will find a way to procure the money to pay for it. Pray for relief from pain due to her TMJ. 2)Brian--pray that he would get out of New York City and come back to Christ--His first love. 3)Jamie--pray that she would cling onto God during this time of heartbreak.  Pray that God would change her through her 6-month dating fast.     4)Pray for the girl's accountibility night tomorrow
