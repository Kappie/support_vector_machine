He gave it to me during lunch, and despite everyone wanting me to open it there, I waited until I got home to open it.   Tomorrow is my first day of Spring Break. Good Stuff. The fact that I didn't have to go to school tomorrow and could sleep in with no interruptions was the only thing that got me through today.   ...Know what's really weird. I woke myself up today. (Usually, I only awake when someone or something else wakes me up.) ..And not only did I wake up on my own, I woke up at  5:20 . Crazy stuff, huh?
