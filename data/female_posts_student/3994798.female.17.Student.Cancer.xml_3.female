Today wuz too awesome you guyz...i didn't even have to GET UP andWALK:D hehehehe excellent. Yes yes...i'm lazy. :P I agree with you tash...monkey should definitely TRY HARDER! But...i dunno..i can't torture him...that's too cruel. Maybe...JUST maybe the balls to the keg of fireworks...but even THAT seems a bit too harsh. Maybe i'll just punch him in the face a few times and pull his hair REALLY HARD! :D That works.    The faking of the doing it with Ryan sounds while he was on the phone was i think BY FAR one of the best events of tonite...or it could have been Janice and Ryan REALLY going at it on ur basement floor tash..that wuz so totally R-RATED! :P *blech* heheheh jokes guys...don't kill me *grins*    I swear tho...stoopid and stoopidette are SO gonna get it tash...the way this guy is treating you...UGH KILL HIM NOW! *anger filled* :P We'll get him...don't worry tash we'll get him. mwahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahhHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHA.

And i REALLY wuz full on my wonderful two slices of red pepper and three smarties...okay so maybe not...shut up :P    Janice's amazing quote of the day "I think we should shove a broom handle up her crotch until it breaks"   Me- what's "it" supposed to be referring to??   Janice-i can't SAY IT!   hahahhah best thing EVER :)    Neways...got home from tash's and lay on my bed listening to the rain...one of the most relaxing things to do in the world.
