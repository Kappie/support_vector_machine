Most toilets flush in the key of E-flat! :-)  Went to church after the conference.   Got a brunch to attend tomorrow so I picked up some muffins on the way home.  Also tried to get dinner out ... Went to Subway and all of the employees were in the back and despite trying to make them aware of my presence, it didn't work.  I left in a huff.  Then I went into the pizza place next door.  They were restocking the pizza and after I came in, two more people came in.  The last one in pushed her way up to the front and placed her order.  Then the guy behind the counter yelled over top, "Who's next?" and just as I went to open my mouth, the girl behind me ordered.  Standing there mouth agape and near tears for being proverbially stepped on by not one but two people, the girl behind me seemed to notice and said, "Oh sorry, go ahead" and I just said, "No, never mind" and walked out before I burst into tears.  I am such an emotional freak.  I was about to give up and just have a bowl of Cheerios but I tried one more, the burger place next door.  Finally got served in there.  More to come...
