I did not know the people in that shuttle, so ok, my deepest sympathy goes out to their families. The space program can go to hell, what is the point in bringing little insects like mice into space?  I have been brought up not to care about much, i.e: I have had to sleep in a broken bed all my life apart from when I was in a cot or whatever it is called. I am told to shut up and put up about it. I have to live with that sort of attitude, so I personally grow up with it.  In case you are wondering, I hit you deliberatly around the head because you had constantly been talking about me in science and playing some card game and saying "Max is the arsehole", not forgetting you threw that thing that Andy had  twice  at me.
