I don't want to do any Homework so I'm just sitting here playing video games.  GRRR!  I'm pissed!  Another thing, are we going to do stuff tomorrow and Saturday?  I might be busy on Friday, so (if I am) I am hoping that you folks will do something Saturday.  Well, um...  Yeah, I'm bored.  See everybody...  Later!
