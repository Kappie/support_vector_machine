Got up early (Ã§ause of some stupid person outside my window with a hammer and a piece of metal) watched Gilmore Girls...spoke to my mum and dad. Thanks heavens ^_^ Found out my dad can't work for a month, and broke some ribs but if he hadn't been wearing his seatbelt he most likely would have been killed. Well...good morning Hannah....  Didn't do much until Carlos came over at about 3pm. Then we made Brigaderio, and a cake. After cake #1 was taken out of the oven, and pryed out of the pan, they decided it was best to make cake #2. (this became a unanimous vote after half the cake snapped when Carlos was prying it up with a knife andlanded on top of the microwave) Gabby came over to do cake #2, while Maju and Carlos made some more Brigaderios....we were in the middle of doing the last batch, when we'd noticed ants had gotten a hold of the first bunch. My god...  I got an e-mail from my mum, birthday greetings from most people on my MSN list, brithday greetings from people I hardly know...and yet, my best friend hasn't come on MSN or even sent an e-mail. *growls* I've been needed to talk with her for ages!! I can't phone 'cause it's too expensive, no one's come online from back home for me to ask them to phone her...It's so frustrating. I can't even send an e-mail because she rarely checks her e-mail.  *sighs*  Well, hopefully we're going to a club tonight. We were going to go last night but then either everyone couldn't afford it, or couldn't be bothered to go. Tonight it's free for the girls, and cheap for the guys...she my fingers are crossed. Ugh, I need something to do. Nothing really happens until the evening.  Robin....Mal....someone....come online.  -Hannah
