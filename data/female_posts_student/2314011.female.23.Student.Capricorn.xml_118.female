In other news, the Idaho House of Representatives is voting in 15 minutes on whether to ban gay marriage via a constitutional amendment.  Sent emails to 6 of those reps telling them how much I'd appreciate it if they voted against it.  Not much, but maybe just enough (gasp!)  And now on to Civil Procedure reading about fee shifting and settlements.  Yay.
