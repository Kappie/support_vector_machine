I got Blink 182's old old old (not that old) cd yesturday at walmart. Ha "High Five To The Walmart!" Yeah so it's alright. But while I'm there trying to figure out what to get, My mom is just strolling around and she's like "Why don't you get Trapt" and I'm like "aaaaaaa, mabey" so to convice me she starts singing it in front of a bunch of people. It was so funny! She's like "Back off I'll take you on!" I was like "Oh man.... just shut up" It was emmbarrassing in a funny way. Like 2 or 3 years ago if she did that I would be all winey and like STOP!! but it was funny... and as she was leaving to let me look by my self she goes "I'll see you later" like he does in the song. it was funny. I think the guy standing near me got a kick out of it, either that or he thought we were stupid. My dad is being such an ass hole. I gotta go bye
