G posted the cast list.  ...I don't think many people were happy...  Taylor didn't get a part at all... I know she's majorly bummed...  Some people who got parts--pretty decent parts--aren't very good at acting, (IMHO), and are not very responsible...  G was actually nice about letting me leave school today. Yay for him having a heart!...   Oh, and it snowed this morning... It's raining now though. :(
