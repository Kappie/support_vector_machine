Without him, I feel his arms around me,   And when I lose my way, I close my eyes,   And he has found me...   In the rain,The pavement shines like silver,   All the lights are misty in the river,   In the darkness the trees are full of starlight,   And all I see is him and me,Forever and forever...   And I know it's only in my mind,   That I'm talking to myself and not to him,   And although I know that he is blind,Still I say, there's a way for us...   I love him,But when the night is over,He is gone, the river's just a river   Without him the world around me changes,   The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers.   I love him,But everyday I'm learning,All my life,I've only been pretending,   Without me,His world will go on turning,   A world that's full of happiness,   That I have never known...   I love him...    I love him...   I love him...    But only on my own...(",)
