For those of you who have never ever been to PixelLand, I recommend you guys to throw birthday parties there for lil kids. Its like a fun lil carnival which is like a circus to me. I had so much fun I think I was worst then my daughter.   I got a chance to see old old old friends and many new faces. I was introduced to this one hot Pilipino girl, we shook hands and I smiled at her. While shaking hands she squeezed my hands so hard I couldn’t pulled away nor could I tell her that she was hurting me. Dude, she didn’t want to let go. My innocent smile became a fake smile because I was hurt. I felt like screaming OUCH but I held it. To tell you the truth I almost slip out a fart because it hurt so bad. Lol.   Didn’t she know that Sakdary is hella fragile? Didn’t she know that Sakdary is just a lil girl? Didn’t she know that she was hurting me? I’ll remember to never ever shake her hands again. I must admit that she was a hottie and she’s probably a meanie too. Come to think of this, I’m getting kinda scared to shake hands with pretty girls. Hey, that was just a silly thought, I’d take that back =D.
