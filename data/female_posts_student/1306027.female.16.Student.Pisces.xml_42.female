Lol.. well, that's not the entire truth. I can name at least five people who I would have loved to read it too and meant it for them. But then they might think I'm so weird freak stalking them.. cause guys aren't ones for poetry. Or at least the ones I know aren't :-P. Onward with tha poetry!    "Where are You?"     By: Meghan     I am in love, With who I am not sure. But I can feel his presence out there, As I whisper my gentle prayer; Where are you?  Patiently I sit, Silent do I stay. Maybe he just walked by, Perhaps he will drop down from the sky. Where are you?  My soul longs for you, Crying my heart does seek you. I long to look into your eyes, Eyes that could never tell me lies. Where are you?  Come fill my heart with childish glee, Please come and never leave. Take my heart and make it whole, Say that you will never let me go. Here I am - But where are you?    Erg Da Jerg (slur for Erk the Jerk)
