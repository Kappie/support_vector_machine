This person might have gone away and not told anyone, or may possibly seem upset, and shut him or herself away from everyone else. Your friend is probably basically OK, and apt to be upset with someone outside the household rather than within it. Let this person work it out in whatever way they see fit. Your friend will share with you when the time is right.
