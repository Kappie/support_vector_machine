Mum told her to  pack lightly , and Casey took her seriously. Hung around for a few more hours, dreading leaving, until we eventually got a move on. We got 5 minutes off the way, and Michael goes,  "Mum, I'm hungry!! When are we going to be there?" , Mum replied in a slightly annoyed tone,  "Michael, we're only in  Belrose !!"  Casey murmurs:  "Ahhhhhh, the Twilight Zone...."  So we're driving along, bout an hour into the trip and there is this big accident on the highway, so Dad decides to take a detour into this back road to get around the traffic. But unfortunatley, everyone else had the same idea, so we were all stuck in traffic in the back streets of "Lebanon" as Mum called it (it was actually Chullora, which is basically occupied bi Lebanese people) Dad was getting really impatient. It was veerry funny. All of the neighbours were coming outside to see what was going on. Here is a dialogue that actually happened that Casey and I created after:   A recipe for a dysfunctional family: Take two young, physco, farting boys, two uncontrollably argumentative parents, and one cheerleader, put them into a car for 5 hours and you have Beth's dysfunctional family. Add KC into the mix and you've got hell! Driving through the streets of Lebanon: Boys: "Fart, Fart. Who pulled my hair? Muuum, Callum's farting again! I'm hungry!" Dad: Look, now we're off the way! A half an hour wait now!! I'll jsut drive up onto the sidewalk so I can get one car ahead!" Mum: Don't you dar you impatient man! You're setting a bad example to the kids! Calm down! Caaalllm down!" Beth: (clapping) Be aggressive, be, be, aggressive! Casey: (singing) We're all going on a (clap) summer holiday! Everyone: Shutup Casey!!   After we escaped the clutches of the evil "Lebanon" and everyone had calmed down after all the excitement, Casey got a message on her fone. It was from Barney (aka. Adrian, KC's bro) The message read: Where are you? KC replied by saying: Canberra you loser! He actually didn't know where she was! Haha. That's Barney 4 ya! And we played "Eye Spy with my big, fat, pussy, bleeding eye" which was  SO MUCH FUN!! Not!!!   After we arrived in Canberra we drove into our accomodation which was "Carotel Motel" which was this really shotty, hole of a place, and I ran into our "Villa House" (2 bedrooms, a loungeroom and a toilet/bathroom, all crammed into like 20 square metres) and started screaming  "It's a hole! Hole! Canberra's a hole!"  While Mum got increasingly annoyed at me! Haha. So Mum, Dad and the boys decided to go out 4 a ride, 2 start the training 4 the competiton that was on on Saturday. So KC and I were left alone. 1 TV station, no radio, all alone, 2 degrees, no food, surviving on gum, bored out of our  MINDS , KC found blood on the floor and we were teriffied, and we had no civilisation apart from my mobile phone. We were in a desperate situation until Luke called mi mobile and saved us! Well me at least. KC was lonered. :p Haha. Luke and I talked 4 an hour (actually 43mins 59secs according 2 mi fone) and it was a great relief from mi boredom! Thankyou Luke! Haha, only I feel bad about the money issue. That's gonna b a big phone bill 4 Luke! Whoops! We went out 4 dinner at Zefferelli's pizza place. It was 2 degrees outside and we saw a girl in a mini-skirt!! When we were walking 2 the restaurant, KC and I were threatening 2 scream out such stuff as,  "Canberra's a hole, Sydney rox!"  and  "Why did they put a fence around Canberra? So people wouldn't fall in!"  But Mum stopped us. Shame really. Haha. The only good thing about Canberra, might I just add, is that it has sooo many bums!! (aka. hobos, homeless people) I love bums! I think they r soo cool! And all the bums at Canberra stand at the traffic lights and wash ur windscreen 4 money. They r soo cool. Mi fave one had orange scraggly hair and a fag in his mouth. He walked right up 2 and past our car as well. Gosh that got us excited. U know I don't actually know anyone who doesn't like bums. Mi family (minus mum and dad) like bums, and mi group at school. hehe. 'Cept maybe hannah, she was chased bi one. But really, Canberra has the coolest bums!! Might i add, Casey and I had 2 share a room with both of my brothers, and the snoring was terrible!! What is it with guys...  Next day Mum wanted us 2 go site-seeing. Oh yay!! We had 2 go to War Memorial first. And we had a 2 and a 1/2 hour tour, with this 85 year old lady. Mum enjoyed it, but no-one else did. I had soo many SMS's while I was in there, and i eventually had to turn mi fone on silent becuase Mum said i was being "disrespectful". Next we had 2 go to Parliment House. Wow, how lucky are we, two of the most boring places in earth right after each other. Once again, Mum wanted us 2 have the tour, because if we don't we "don't learn anything" Mi god, that wouldn't be good would it! It's called a  holiday!!  We're not 'sposed 2 learn! So Casey and I were waiting 4 the tour in this foyer place at the top of the marble staircase, and we saw all these school groups go past, and we started calling out all this stuff 2 them like,  "Don't worry, it'll all be over soon", "We feel your pain!" and "Hang in there, you'll soon be out of this hole!"  The kids and us exchanged thumbs up, but we got many-a greasys from the school teachers!! Haha We had a "pretending Casey was one of the family" day. :D Mel came over 2 nite. Seeing as she was passing through from Sussex 2 the Snow, and she came and visited! And she found out that Mitch was gonna be here (he was staying next 2 us, he's mi famous cycling cuz whom she is obsessed with) and we were sitting outside talking (even tho it was bout 3 degrees) and  we organised 4 Mitch 2 come ova afta he finished dinner. 'Cept Alexe came and picked Mel up and literally 2 minutes after she left Mitch came!! It was soo funny! And he's got a really cool new haircut!  The next day was the first day of "The ACT State (which doesn't really make any sense becuase ACT isn't a state) Road Championships" Veerry boring. The only good thing bout it was that we were literally surrounded by hot, half-naked, muscly cyclists in lcyra!! Haha. There was this one guy who kept on laughing at mi brothers. Ha. Don't blame him, they were being pretty stupid. Callum went alright (15th and 18th) but he has lots of competiton in his divison. Michael went really well (2nd and 3rd) The trip there was the funny bit. It's about a 40min drive from our hole hotel, and when we got there, Dad tried 2 park, and he backed right into this ditch thingo, and then we were stuck, and he tried 2 get out, and all this smoke was coming from the back of the car, then the exhaust blew up and this big fireball of grass shot out and we got out of the ditch. It was funny enuf (espescially since everyone was looking!) except that he  DID IT TWICE!!  Haha. That's mi Dad 4 u. 2nite we went out 2 dinner at ElDerado's and towards the end of the meal, Dad was eating slices of oranges and lemons, and when he ate them, he'd rocket back and make this weird face expression and sounds, and this was called his "Power Boost". It was so funny! He nearly knocked over a waiter! We milked it 4 all its worth, and made him have about 20 "Power Boosts" When we got home Mum made us go to bed early because the boys had  "big day ahead of them" and everyone was in bed and asleep (minus KC and I) by 8.30!! So obviously KC and I couldn't sleep. There were all these phsyco loud teenagers from the NSW soccer team or sumthing running around outside cuz they were staying here too. And KC had a window next 2 her bed that looked outside. So KC and I were sitting there watching the kids outside through the window, and we were waiting 4 sum of them 2 go past so we could say  "Pssst..Hey Kid come here!"  and when they came over Casey wanted to say -  "Apple?!...." and "Bootstrap?!"  Haha, mi gosh it was funni. We got pretty close 2 acheiving our goal. But KC stuffed it up in the end. :P  Next day was the last day of competitons, and Callum got another 11th and he got a 2nd, but they disqualified all the riders, becuase of what one group did. It was a very controversial decision, and a bit complicated, but yeh, basically that was counted as a no race, so Callum didn't get his silver medal. Michael got two more 3rd places, and he came 3rd overall, he got 2 ACT State Champ medals (both bronze) and $40 prize money. Mitch came 4th overall, and got a MUCH bigger amount of money!! Uncle Warren once again displayed how obsessed he was with setting me up with guys (everytime he comes over he says stuff like,  "So do you have a boyfriend?"  and  "Why haven't I met your boyfriend"? ) by saying,  "Oooo, Beth, any guys take you fancy? It's a great place 2 look 4 a boyfriend. There's lots of cute half-naked cyclists here (scary that he was thinking what i was! haha (last part tho) )"  Ahhh...he's a lost cause that one. We passed our friend the bum, but Mum wouldn't let him wash our car! :(  Finally we were going home!!!! Michael asked if  "We were going back to Australia now?"  It was basically a pretty boring trip seeing as all of our Discmans had conked out. I spent most of the trip asleep. Nice interval of Delta music that I enjoyed singing along 2 at the top of my voice. Gotta luv Delta. Constant bickering in the car tho. Espescially towards the end. We were  ALL  glad 2 get home!! And guess where the first place i went when I got home was? The computer.....  A strange trip in the ultimate capital hole of Australia (ironic actually), filled with bums, bootstraps and high tempers.  Blogging off, Beth
