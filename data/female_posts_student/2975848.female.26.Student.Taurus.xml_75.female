I was a lost soul. Meaningless, In this cruel world As the years passed by I grew up, becoming a new person I till carry my scars and sorrows Though… I’ve learned to enjoy little things in life Due to all the pain I knew inside A delicate flower The warm Sunlight The rain on my face A kiss An hug A smile The colours… of life These and many other little things Make me wanna live again tomorrow Giving me the will to go on They’re my treasures They’re my secrets Where I get my happiness
