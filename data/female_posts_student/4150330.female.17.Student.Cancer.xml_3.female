Find a way to get myself through the day Don't know what else I can do Need a way to be free of the pain I'm told its found all in You.  Where is away when away was here Thinking and hoping there's nothing to fear I look and search for the One to come Then I find I am all alone.  Like those times we could play all day The world was full of things to do Younger times we didn't know any pain Before I forgot about You.  Where was I when I was lost Blinded by demons and almost paid the cost I've looked and found the One who came He's never gone because He rose again.            (c)Crystal Joseph
