All 6 lbs 2 ounces, 19 inches of her! She is the first child of my little sister  urlLink Leslie  and her husband  urlLink Zach.  She came two weeks early, and we were very happy to see her. Congratulations guys!  Speaking of babies�there is another one on the way. My mom received a phone call this morning around 3 am from my brother  urlLink Corey  up in Idaho. His wife  urlLink Jenna  was expecting baby Westley in June, but he has also decided to come a bit early. Westley is quite a bit early, but the last ultrasound  urlLink Jenna  had showed the baby to be round about 6 lbs already. His size will be okay for a premature birth, the question will lie in the internal organs, the lungs especially and if they have had enough time to develop.  urlLink Jenna  is in labor this very minute up in Idaho, and my mother has a flight booked for tomorrow morning. I hope and pray all will turn out well and yet another gorgeous baby will bless our ever growing family.   On more of a personal note, �Machinal� performed tonight for the first time in front of an audience. It went really well! I did well, the cast did well, and it was very well accepted by the crowd. It was a preview show, and only two classes of theatre students were invited to attend. Technically we don�t open with a real, ticket buying audience till tomorrow, but it was an audience just the same. It was great for the first show to go well.  More personal good news�I have already been cast in another show. The college�s next production will be �Jesus Christ Superstar�. I auditioned and have been cast as one of the evil priests (one of the Pharisees for those of you who are biblically literate). It is an ensemble role, but just a step above chorus. I am really excited! The director, Mark, has some very different and very interesting visions of the show. It will be a fun experience to participate in.  No job found yet, still looking. I can�t seem to nail anything down. I continue to try though, and again, if anyone knows of anything please let me know. As far as the car situation goes, I received a letter from the DMV letting me know my license has been suspended. It will remain so till I furnish the DMV with proof that I no longer have the medical problems that led to my accident. At this point, even if I could afford a car I would not be able to drive it. Everything happens for a reason�I just have to keep telling myself that.  That�s about it for now. I will try my hardest to write more. I know� promises�promises�but I really will try. I will talk/see/chat with you later!
