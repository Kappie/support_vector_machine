While waiting for the light to change, random rays of light radiated from this huge cloud. That has been me this week.  The light bursting from darkness, as the evil weather lifted so has my mood.  I really don't care about the homework I'm behind on and suddenly I have begun to make progress on the piles of it.  If I didn't have class tonight and Open Mic Night tomorrow, I would even begin cleaning my room.  I'm actually in the mood to open the windows wide, take down my curtains, blast music and then rip my room to parts, just to reorganize it
