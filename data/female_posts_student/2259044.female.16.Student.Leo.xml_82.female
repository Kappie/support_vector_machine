(couldn't tell couldja lol) besides its an excuse to get away from town and to be off away from phones ringing and emails and people and classes, it's like a crazy get-away place, where u can just be w/families, and be close to God and just ahh (breath a sigh of relief)  so anyhow that's where i'm going this weekend, feel free to email me and such but i won't get back to you till sunday evening! much love, changedfish
