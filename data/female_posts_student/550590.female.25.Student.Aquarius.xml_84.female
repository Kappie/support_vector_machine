Today was worse than usual, to the point where I couldn't help but complain about he-that-should-not-be-named all night at court.  When it got to be 24 hours since I last ate (since I was too busy working rather than talking to my girlfriend on the internet when I should have been getting ready for court) and I was waiting around babysitting while he was off getting "interviewed" by some journalism student from UF, I had had enough.  I'm so close to saying screw it, I quit...of course that would require having the money to pay my bills for the next couple months, when I can't even afford to do so this month.  I'm so frustrated I just want to scream.  What an absolute mess my life has become.  In the meantime I'll be content to watch Will and Grace and eat cookie dough.  "I came from a broken home and now I come from a broken gnome."  "I'm the gnome wrecker."
