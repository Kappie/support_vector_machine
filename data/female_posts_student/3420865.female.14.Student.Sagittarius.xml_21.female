(AAAAACK. the love of my life went to see the movie too. aah i was like FREAKING. but he doesn't know me/want to know me. frik.)  after the movie, lana went home, and me, sofija and the guys went to A, and the guys were making sofija almost piss herself... it was amazing. and since we're all SO cool, we hung (loitered) outside A till my brother picked me and sofo up. it was sweet.  today, i went to sofija's at like 8 (yeah that's right. in the  morning. ), lana came over, and we went to taylor evans to see the talent show! and i must admit, i was blown away. truly, madly, deeply. so after seeing dozens of people i've never seen in my life performing at t.e., lana went home, and me and sofija went to gateway! wow. it was so cool. we went when it was lunch time, so we got to see all the cool grade 8's. so since sofija had never been to/seen gateway (EVER), i gave her a tour. and we saw mr. creighton and he gave us chocolate... and it rocked. then we went to erin's house, but she wasn't home, and then we walked to tim horton's. i bought a sandwich, and sofija's friends from t.e. who we had seen that very morning were thurr. and we kindof chilled with them... but i felt out of place, cuz you know, i don't know them.  so after the tim horton's thing, we went back to gateway because sofija had a brilliant idea to give the jacket i was carrying to chelsea. then i wouldn't have to carry it anymore. so we did, but then she gave it back to me...frik. so then we talked to chelsea i swear for like half an hour. it was CRAZY. she's so cool... wow, i wish  i  was as cool as her when i was in grade 8. wow. and then i saw josh and matty and robert and austin for the first time in like 2 years (not really,  but it has been a long time).  so after being at gateway for 279472 hours, we went to ray's house, but he wasn't home, and then we went to mike's house. and me and mike sat and watched his dog lick sofija to death...and she liked it. a lot. it was kindof "sick". and then, after sofija went into mike's room and sprayed his bed with gross-smelling-stuff, we walked him to his band practise at anson's. awww.  and then, came a cool part of the adventure. WE GOT TO WATCH THEM PRACTISE. yeah. i know. it was amazing. we only got in after we begged evan and mike, and obviously after we asked anson. (p.s. anson=my new best friend. he rocks). but then, came the sad part. it took them like 10 minutes to set up, and 5 minutes to play one song, and since they had originally said we could only stay for 15 minutes, we were kicked out onto the street. and, in case you were wondering, i finally got rid of my jacket that was being a loser and that i had to carry. how? i left it at anson's house. *grins.*  so after being disowned by the guys, we walked  all the way back to sofija's house . and i met her mom. she's sweet.  oh, and then sofija walked me to the bus stop... but i missed it. twice. frik.  "hey there's the bus!"-me "aaaah run!"-sofija "no, i'll miss it!"-me "no you won't. he'll stop if he sees you running."-sofija *bus drives by as we run towards it. thanks.*  so i bought nerds to pass the time, and we ate them off the ground and waited (in the shade, thank god) until my bus came. it was sweet.  quotes from last night/today:  "what kindof burger do you want?"-sofija "i dunno, i'll share one with you."-me "ok. i want a grandpa."-sofija "ahah! just a grandpa, not a burger."-me "ahahaha! YES! omg i'm gonna go up there and ask for a grandpa!"-sofija  "my patience is like a pie.. its eaten quickly.. well .. at least in my family. well, no.. patience isn't eaten, it kind of.. disappears, like water evaporating, so it's not like a pie, at all."-sofija  "can we come to your band practise?"-sofija "no."-evan "fine. i'm never wearing my delenda shirt  again ."-sofija "fine! you're not our biggest fan anymore then. kate is!"-evan/mike "sweet!"-me *5 seconds later, after sofija cried in her corner.* "ok, you're our biggest fan again. sorry kate."-evan  "penis is such a funny word."-chelsea. oh man. you have much to learn... aha but you're awesome.  "omg if noah was here, i'd melt!"-me "omg so would i! i would melt into a puddle, and then everyone would slip on me."-sofija *demonstrates what people would look like if they were to slip on her, ends up kicking me instead.*-sofija  "wow. one of your friends said i had pretty eyes... woot. what a sweet day."-sofija  frik. there were so many other quotes... like from when we were sitting at galaxy waiting for the guys to come. it was amazing.  well, i'm off now. cuz i seriously suck at blogging, and need to keep a tape recorder on me or something to record all the things that people say. frik. why didn't i think of that before?  why?  because you suck, kate. you suck.  my life is not my own- it was bought for me.  kayte.
