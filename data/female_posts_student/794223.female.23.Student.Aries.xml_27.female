Foi muito divertido, sim.  One of the funniest moments EVER was when Jessica barged in: Jessica:  I am so high. ::strange, amusing silence:: Everyone in the room, including Joe--our UT professor who taught us in Brazil, burst out laughing.  It was a classic, albeit odd, Jessica entrance.  Jason's photos blew everyone else's out of the water.  They are, hands down, the most beautiful photographs I have ever laid eyes on.  He processed them in slide form, which brought out colors that I didn't even realize existed.  Seriously--I was with him when he took many of the pictures in Brazil, and the photos look better than the actual reality did.  He should seriously consider a career with National Geographic.  Other than the above described Brazilian festa, my weekend was relatively boring.  I did what I usually do-study.  I have one more Oceanography exam to take at ACC, then I'm done with that blasted course.  Stupid science requirements.    I really, really, need to work on my thesis this week.  I swear I'm almost done...
