This is the only song going through my head now, I lovingly refer to is as the "Fuck you song."   Thank you Eamon for making a song angry enough to relate to.   See, I don't know why I liked you so much I gave you all of my trust I told you I loved you Now thats all down the drain You put me through pain  I wanna let you know (how) I feel..  Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now Fuck the presents might as well throw 'em out Fuck all those kisses they didn't mean jack Fuck you, you ho I don't want you back  You thought you could keep this shit from me You burnt bitch I heard the stories..    I broke up with A .,  hmmm...I wonder if he'll check his email first or this blog....if this is A.- read YOUR EMAIL.   Bratislava was cool, but an incident almost, damned near demolished my weekend.  On top of that, I have a raging case of Bronchitis and had to ride on the damned train for 7 hrs.  More on Bratislava shall come later.  For now, I need to lick some wounds and recover what shamble of pride I might find in the dark hidden recesses of myself.  A fucking waste, thats all my now ex-relationship was.  A waste of my time, and an apparent benefit to him, he had a puppet's emotions to manipulate.  No more.  My reasoning:   I am finished with his willful misrepresentations and outright flagrant lies, which he had deviously masked from me.  I know A.  You weren't "asleep" when you stood me up that first time, you were with her.  You were also with her, or at least trying to be with her outside the second time.  You didn't "forget" or "forget the time".  fuck that.  I can't believe that in an effort to dispel quarrels I actually said "I'm sorry" or "I'm sorry, too."  WHY.  WHAT THE FUCK DID I HAVE TO BE SORRY ABOUT EXCEPT I WAS A CUCKOLD TO A WANDERING EYE, AND I TURNED MY BACK.  I could also be called pitifully permissive and easily deceived. YES I AM SORRY THIS TOOK SO DAMNED LONG TO END.  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TIME YOUR SORRY ASS MADE ME WAIT ALL FUCKING NIGHT LONG, ALL DRESSED UP ON MY DAMNED COUCH.  I was actually worried, is he in an accident, is he alright.....YEAH YOU WERE FUCKING ALRIGHT, YOU WERE WITH ______.(name omitted to protect the innocent.)      I bought your pussy explanations, and even though instinctively something said, NO!!!, I acquiesced.  I said I was sorry too, for getting mad at you, no, no no no, Thats mistake number one= being mad was the correct state of mind, saying "I'm" sorry, was ass-backwards.  There is also the issue of two morally based topics thats were discussed between myself and ______(she whose name shall not be dragged into this shit).  1.  The non-disclosure of topic "a" to me, his girlfriend, but he rattled that shit off to _______, and is something that damned sure should have been brought up.  lets move on to topic "b"  this is great, I thought I was having the most appropriate relationship ever at 23, you know the old saying, "don't do something you wouldn't do in front of your mother."  well.....that would have applicability here.  But, no, there seem to be differences between the manner of relationships in his harem.   Three things, that one should not overlook.  I went to the vatican to get a rosary blessed for him.  Well I guess he'll need it.  Three big things, two so big they are not posted explicitly on here, for fear an unprepared person might read this.  BURN BRIDGE BURN.
