I'm lucky because I don't need to rely on something amazing in my life to make me happy.  Life doesn't have to be spectacular to make me content.  I don't need everything to fit together in life.  That's part of what makes it so exciting for me.  Is knowing that there are still things out there that are just waiting to go right for me.  To know that there are opportunities waiting to be grasped...but maybe not just yet.  Not right away.  I'm lucky because I'm patient.  I don't need the prospect of "love" to fuel my happiness.  Or whatever.  People care too much about their fantasy life, where everything is wonderful and dream-like.  Well, wake up.  As amazing as that would be if it were true, life isn't like that.  Tiny parts of your life may resemble dreams, but you have to live in reality.  And I am lucky.  I've got my ducks in a row...I feel freakin' great.  My life isn't perfect, and it's got it's quirks that I could work out, but I just don't want to.  Because without a few quirks, life wouldn't be nearly as interesting.  And where's gonna be all the drama when they do my story on E! ?  Haha, just kidding.  But really, in retrospect, I want a damn good story to tell when I write my memoirs.  Damn right.  And it is for that, for the imperfections in my life, that I am truly fortunate.  The fact that I can accept it puts me on a different level.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* My family and I were watching The Apprentice tonight, and we were discussing who we thought should be fired, etc etc...and I realized that no one else in my family ever has good reasoning.  I hate to insult them (my parents just threw a huge fit a few days ago because they thought I was insulting their intelligence), but they never put reasoning behind anything. It's always, he's wrong, she's wrong, and never any explanation.  I seem to get the same treatment from them.  When I argue, I always make sure I have something to back myself with.  But when I argue with them (and this goes for my dad especially), they tend to just throw out these wild arguments with nothing to support their case.  And of course, even if I throw an amazing case out there with undeniable backing and evidence, because they are my parents, they will win by default. Can you tell I have plans for a career in law? It's something I excell in.  Even when it comes to opinions, which was the case tonight.  When I explained to them who I thought should be fired, I had firm reasoning and an undeniably good case.  They even took to my side after I presented my argument. Unfortunately, Donald Trump didn't feel the same way.  But who can blame him... he  didn't hear what I had to say.  Well, I'm sure I've bored you all significantly, so if you feel it necessary to find a gun to shoot yourself, or me, I'll let you go tend to that now.  Au revoir, crazies.
