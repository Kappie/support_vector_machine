Stealthy, annoying, and as a common as air, the little vermin make havoc of any otherwise enjoyable Summer's night. Everyone is farmiliar with the itchy welts they leave on human skin, after having extracted their vampiric quota from our innocent flesh.   But truly, greater than this messup was nature's idiotic endevor aimed at correcting it, the skeeter-eater, or cranefly. Oh yes, promises of mosquito bodycounts per unit the size of summer tempratures themselves were the pledges of the skeeter-eater, but in fact they turned out to be one of the most defunct creatures ever produced.   The cranefly is probably the only hunter in nature that can be foiled by  dust.  DUST, people! Constantly you see the poor miserable flying defects caught up in a stream of dust that has attached itself seemingly inextricably to one of it's overlong, ungainly legs, causing it to fly around clumsily and frantically, hitting itself into things and generally making a colossal embarassment of itself. I've never seen what eventually happens to them, but judging by their charecteristics as creatures, one would have to make the assumption that they die in some isolated corner after crying their pitiable compound eyes out and cursing whatever cruel twist of cosmic fate left them to be the Tony Danzas of the insect kingdom.   What's more, the useless sacks of insect guts rarely, if ever, curb actual mosquito populations, judging by the stream of the diminutive draculas that swarm unemcumbered by nature's white knight in the cause of unmutillated skin and unravished banks of precious, life-giving blood.   If any other creature in nature possessed the sheer ineptitude of the cranefly, PETA themselves would not stand in the way of its accelerated extinction. Imagine a tiger gallomphing around the jungle, knocking itself into trees and finally dying in a shameful heap because a chunk of dust became ensconced in one of its paws! Who would question the wisdom of executing such tigers of the misery of their own absurd, Camusian existences? It would, in fact, be the most compassionate thing to do.   Moreover, the skeeter-eater has become such a colossal failure at hunting mosquitos, it has desisted even trying, and in one of the lowest survival strategies ever attempted in the light of biological day, the contemptible mis-machinations actually consume gunk to survive!  GUNK, people! The cast-off of the universe! The bottomest of the bottom-feed! Literally the most useless, repulsive, filthy substance known to have been created is the so-called skeeter-eater's filet mignon, the one thing in the universe which the sad, useless wastes of space can manage to consume.   In conclusion, we can only hope and pray that the undeterrable machinery of evolution works as expediently as possible (most likely through dust-related methods) to utterly extinguish the flame of the skeeter-eater from the universe, leaving the only knowledge of its short but excruciatingly pitiful chapter in the book of life to be a long-forgotten parchment squirreled in the recesses of a library devoted to such unbelievably boring subjects.   -Theo
