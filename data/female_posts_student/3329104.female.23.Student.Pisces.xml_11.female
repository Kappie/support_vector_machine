I am really glad she went and can't wait to hear from her.  Everything is cool at work. I am not letting things frustrate me anymore at the job. It's just a video store, you know? I think I bombed my last geology exam. I am not looking forward to seeing that grade. I got a 4.0 in Social Problems so that is good. Oh I got a scholarship! Yay. It's a Chicano Education Teacher's Scholarship. I wonder if they know I am not Mexican. I am Puerto Rican. It would be like giving someone from Idaho the British Citizen's Scholarship...or something along those lines. We may speak the same language (Spanish) but we are different countries. Whatever. It's 900 dollars. I really need to take a Spanish class so I can refresh my memory.  Talya
