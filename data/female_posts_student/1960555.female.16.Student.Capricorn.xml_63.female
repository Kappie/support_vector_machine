Glory Fades x Brand New  Mood:  Analysis Mode    She hits the lights. /This doesn't seem quite fair. /Despite everything he learned from his friends, /he doesn't feel so prepared. /She's breathing quiet and smooth. /He's gasping for air. /"This is the first and last time," he says. /She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his. /He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. /He's holding back from telling her /exactly what it really feels like.   That's the lyrics to this song.... Yea, totally didn't get what it was really about until right now.  I was just so intent on listening to the crazy sound I completly overlooked the lyrics (shut up, I know it was wrong... it's like music fan creato to listen to all components of the song, but people slip up once and a while.) Would people actually do that just to finally have sex?  I find that kinda sad (pathetic) and it's sad (sad) because half way he starts to regret it.     It used to be the reason I breathed/ but now it's choking me up.    the station where the act becomes the art of growing up.   Is it like you can't be an adult without first loosing your virginity?  This is so messed up.... (my bad... just stole a line from the song)  Why do people (guys usually, but not always) feel this way.  It's sex, what's the big deal.  If you look at it from a religious point of view, then it's a big deal, but otherwise it's just a thing.  Why do people wait their whole freaking lives for one moment.  Guess what kids, the first time is usually the worst time.  No one knows what they're doing and it's just.... not good... (so I'm told... so I'm told).  I do not understand people.  I don't like any of you... actually there are a couple I like... but besides them you're all nuts.  I don't understand humans at all.  We're so weird and different and nothing is the same about people, yet everything is the same.  It's just plain crazy.  And why is it okay for guys to have random, meaningless sex but it's practically evil for a girl to do it.  I hate double standards.  Will someone please explain this world to me.  I don't get it.  I wish I did... then maybe I could live in it peacefully.  And what's the deal with age.  Age is just a concept... and an overrated one at that.  What does it matter?  Why does it matter....
