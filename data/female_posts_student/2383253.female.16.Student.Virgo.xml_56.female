Today was so awesome with Insha at the beach, plus, I got a little more tan and some good exercise from that 30 minute walk to the mini tidepool area. Also, I think my Mother's Day gift for today definitely takes the cake: instead of your ordinary gift such as cooking up a nice breakfast or making some homemade craft for my mom, I spent an hour cleaning up cat shit this morning. That's right--cat shit. My cats have issues and this whole year they've been turding outside of the litter box in the garage, so as a gift to my mom, I cleaned up the entire garage floor and vacuumed and mopped it until it was spotless. I won't go into graphic detail about the sights and smells I had to endure in there, but I think I should win some kind of award for courage under fire. Needless to say, this made my mom very happy.  I'm done with all my AP tests for the rest of the year (since I decided not to take the Physics one tomorrow, good luck on that shit), but I'm not done with all the stresses in my life. As of this moment, I'm procrastinating on my score for my music composition final project due tomorrow, but it's actually coming along quite well. I basically used an old music box I had and extracted the melody from it, only to find out that it's Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers" from the Nutcracker Suite. So upon said discovery, I decided to transpose and arrange the waltz in a shorter version with some minor alterations. I arranged it for a trio of violin, viola, and cello with a small consensus, too. Sooooooo...I hope it turns out OK. I still have to mush it all together into one big thingy-ma-bob, so I'll probably be up purty late tonight. Better get cracking.
