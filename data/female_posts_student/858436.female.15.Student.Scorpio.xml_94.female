Today I worked 11 - 2. Nice. Then Sarah came when I got off work and we layed out for a while and talked with Riley, Bill, Flaker, and this new guy that moved here named Joey who I thought was pretty cool. And Jenni, Taylor, Madeline, and Meridith were all there too. But we hung out with the guys lol!   But it was good because I really needed to get out of the house.. plus all the paint fumes were giving me a headache. We'll be finished with painting tomorrow! Yeehaw.  And about all the stuff in my previous post... yeah I'm just trying not to think about it because it brings me to tears. I'm not going to call anyone at Nationals until sometime next week when classes start, because I do want to know how everyone is doing and how much butt they're kicking. I'm happy that they're down there, just unhappy that I'm not.  Sara might be able to come to the concer with me! :-D  So.. guess that's it peeps.
