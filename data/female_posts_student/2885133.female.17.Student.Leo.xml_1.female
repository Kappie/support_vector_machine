Anyhow, we got back late at night so I got to witness crazy, insane drivers. On one of the major and rather deadly intersections, someone drove through the intersection about two seconds before their light turned green. Isn't that how accidents happen? Impatienly anticipating the light?  Anyhow, my leg reminded me it was going to be June soon since it started to spasm. It happens every year, usually right before swim team. The good news is that it does that and I grow about half an inch during the summer... yet the doctors say I won't be growing anymore. Humph.  Ah, and just when I was about to clean my college files, I got more. The fact that so many "elite" colleges are sending me the "interested" letters are making my ego quiver in a very bad way. They make it seem easy to be accepted... but then again, how many "interested" letters do they send out and how many students are actually accepted? And of course, to add insult to injury, or vice versa, Harvard's office of admissions sent one of those letters too with the conclusions being something like "of course, getting into a college like Harvard is a competitive process..." making me feel insignificant. One good day on my PSATs suddenly make me "smart". No matter what the colleges say, test scores  are  highly important. And that makes me whimper since my English grammar is dismal... Chinese doesn't have a thing called tenses so we don't need to conjugate and worry about keeping the tenses straight. Grr.  *** and I am still trying to persuade my parents on that national convention program. Really want to go, but costs are kinda high. For a person who hates fundraising -- asking people for money, basically -- I feel like I am sitting in boiling water.
