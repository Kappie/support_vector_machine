MS won't kill me, and brain cancer could have, but now i have to live the rest of my life waiting for the next relapse to impair me just a little bit more.  i'm so angry and full of rage about this that i can't even think of anything appropriate to write.  i feel like i'm on some sort of pendulum swinging back and forth between wanting to cry myself dry and wanting to put my fist through the wall.    ---  my grandmother just called.  i love her dearly and think she's one of the truest and kindest and most amazing women in the world, and the sound of her voice did well to diffuse the mood i was in a few minutes ago.  we cried together in our conversation.  i've never really cried with her before.  perhaps i've been too busy being "granddaughter" to actually let myself be vulnerable to the one woman in my life who has seen way more than i could possibly throw at her.  i feel brokenhearted right now--i could barely speak to her through my tears.  and her tears?  i just can't handle that.    i think this is all i can write for tonight.  i'm a wreck.  i should probably get some clarity on this before i try to write any more.  there have to be some positives--i just don't see them right now.
