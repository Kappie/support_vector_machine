I took a new way that I've wanted to for a while, and surrounded by clouds of wildflowers and birds singing (I even spotted two birds making love!) I felt such a powerful sense of self love, that I knew I was strong enough to do what I need to do to take care of myself, just for today. The walk lasted a little over an hour, and I was able to watch the train go by, and I always feel better after that. I did not do as well with my eating habits, though. My candy bar total was four by nine am this morning, darn those 2 for a dollar sales to heck! But on a more positive note, a good friend made me dinner tonight, and I listened to my body, because I was sated, and if I'd have eaten more, I would've felt sick and full, and when I am tired and on a low ebb, like lately with all of these weird combos of shifts I have been working lately, (first, second, and third all in one week!)I am likely to feel sick easily if I am not careful to moderate what I do, including eating. I have been making an attempt to drink the 100 or so ounces I am supposed to aim for (I did some research, and a person should divide their body weight in half and drink that in ounces) and I toss in a few cups for exercising too. I spent half the day in the bathroom, I hope my bladder adjusts soon! I am trying to live in today and not get too down on myself for my little backsteps, although it is hard sometimes. Tonight, for example, I play on a horseshoe pitching team, and my back started twinging really bad, from old injuries, (also I am sure from lack of sleep and poor self-care) and the "evil committee" in my brain (mean self talk that tells me how much I suck and all that I can't do) started in about all of the damage to my body that I have done, and would have been quite satisfied if I had felt like crap about it, but I shrugged it off, thinking to myself how I can't take back yesterday, but I can take care of myself today. I am reminded of this by the words of William Allen White, when he said "I am not afraid of tomorrow, for I have seen yesterday, and I love today." This says it for me, for my yesterdays used to be so hopeless and my spirit filled with self-loathing and fear. I am not perfect (not yet, hehe) and I still have bad days, but I care about myself enough to stay sober and work on getting past my hangups to achieve a weight healthy for my body, and that feels so good.
