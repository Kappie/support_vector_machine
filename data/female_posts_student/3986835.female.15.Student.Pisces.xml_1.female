Horrible cafeteria food (because the nearest damn McDonald's is, like, a million miles away...):uh...ready...?, bitchy girls mad-doggin' me: so ready! More stupid guys (more than El Paso):ready. Being the best lookin' chick at this school: damn ready! Okay, no, not really. But I'm ready for everything else. I think that the only good thing about starting a new school is that you basically get to start all over. So no one here knows anything about all the damn Richard rumors, therefore no one thinks I'm a slut. And no one knows exactly how I am, so I could act like a total "Plastic" as Amy would say, or I could just be really mean, or I could be really nice. It's like, I could choose my personality and if I play it off well, I could get away with it. But I think I'll just stick to myself. Shy but friendly but honest but flirty but slightly stuck-up but overall just me. Because I would do a horrible job trying to be anyone else. My acting skills suck. That's why I'm takin' Drama, baby! I've always been told I was a drama-queen, so, I figured hey, why not? Right along with Spanish 2 (again! grr...), Algebra 2/Trigonometry, English 2, World History, Anatomy, and ROTC twice, both semesters. Pretty boring schedule, I know. But, I do wanna graduate with pretty high honors, and so that's how I'm supposed to do so...well, without Drama...I had to take a fun class! OKay, so I'm gonna go figure out what I'm wearing tomorrow.
