It was today, and someone told me it was the 30th or something, and the thing is, I was supposed to come home yesterday but we decided to come home a day later which I am actually very VERY happy for, because my last night there was absolutely AMAZING. haha. Such good times. The whole trip was just, so much fun, I think it's the most fun I've had up there ever. Basically, my uncle has this cottage, and we go up there the second week in July every year and then there's like, this strip of cottages that are connected, There's like, 5 little cottage suite things, and then there's what we call the honeymoon sweet, and the efficiency bellow that. And these things are all connected, and we rent out the whole place. It's just what we do. The owner knows we do. It's sort of a dump place, but...it's like tradition. People have been staying there for as long as I can remember, and it's pretty cheap partially because my uncles take care of a lot of stuff there and clean out the pool and whatnot, but yeah, we rent out the whole place and it's tons of fun. It's called the Terra. That's not where I stay though. I stay at my uncle's cottage which is really really nice, and the beach is right there, and you can go down anytime you want and whatnot. So, everyone in my family comes pretty much, 4 uncles, 5 aunts since one of the aunts divorced her husband who is actually my blood relative, but I haven't seen him in years. Heh, kind of funny how I keep in contact more with his wife and kids than with him considering his wife isn't blood related and stuff, but yeah...Then there's my mom and dad, and my brother even went up this year, and then I have all my older cousins, Joanna, Diana, Paula, Patrick, Chris, Brian, and Erin Chris' wife, and then friends of the family, the shantas, Sam and them, and then Meghan and Chelsea and Nicole. Chelsea and Nicole are like...fricking demon spawn, but....perhaps I'll get to that later. Meghan's really really cool though. I'd never got to know her before this trip, and it was awesome. She's so so nice. Then there's Shalane, and heh, I think that's it for older people up there. Haha, wow sometimes it amazes me how many people all go up there. THEN, heh, there's the kids my age, my three cousins who are all within a year and a half of my age (I'm the oldest in that little group, yay) Sara, Lauren, and Max were all there, and of course Max brought Conor up who he's been bringing up for like...six years now. And then finally, there's the younger kids, Daniell, Sara's little sister, and Peter Max's little brother, and then Peter's friend Dieter. Heh, I think it's cute how they're best friends and their names rhyme, but I'm weird like that. SO, that's all the people I think haha. Wow. So many. But, Max, Conor, Lauren, Sara, and I all hang out together and whatnot. I've got so many more inside jokes after this trip with them...  TJ the Taliban job, bus or butt slut, FS the boat slut, opperations abomination, anialation, and denomination, chillin' in the 'ator, walking into invisible glass doors, the mother, the prude, and the drunken cheerleading slut, Theo, Red Dragon (did we FINALLY see it?) evil bumper boats, yokels, creepy old lady checking us out, Chhhhrrriiiissss, 50 back rubs, loner? pepper? Sara's plot to kill Conor, drills, someone's in the kitchen with Dina..., "I love you guys!" Steal the dear, step one...get regina girls, go-karts, and what's scary is that this list could probably keep going a lot longer...  We just went over to the Terra every night basically and hung out, and did stupid stuff, and kept getting told to get up and go actually do something because all we would do would be sit around. The beach was awesome too, going on the jetskiis. That was SO sweet. I went on with max, and I got up to like...63 mph, and I did a bunch of pretty difficult turns. It was awesome because I don't always get to talk to Max much, and we spent a good two hours out on the water. And...we only fell off once, and that was because I jumped off because I thought we were going to tip over haha. Sara threw Conor off THREE times. It was crazy.   Wow, it's hard to even explain what a good time I had. I mean, it just rocked so much, and then last night was the best of all, but I don't want to write about that in here. Haha. I'm not sure if anyone will know about that. I'm trying to decide if and who to tell. I'm listening to Sara, Lauren, and my song right now.....actually, we have two, haha. My neck, my back....whoo, such a dirty song. That and Colt 45. So great. I LOVED it. Maybe I'll write more later as I remember more about this week, but I just really thoroughly enjoyed myself, and I can't WAIT til next year. Oh yeah....Sam's little talk with Lauren and me....haha. So great. "I'm SERIOUS. Don't until you really love him..." for a half hour haha. And then that guy at the go-karts getting annoyed with Conor.   *Sigh* I'm kind of sad I couldn't stay til tomorrow when everyone else is leaving, because tonight would have rocked too if I could have. Plus, I wish we could have stayed overnight at the Terra more often, Sara Lauren, and me. I guess they're worried since Conor isn't related to any of us. I guess it's understandable, but...we're going to really try to change that next year and talk them into it. We never left before like....2:00 in the morning anyway. Last night, or this morning we didn't leave til 4! But, that was because of the blackjack tournament Oh gosh, that was so much fun too. I kept like....doing really well, and then I'd have to bet it all to keep up with Dieter, and I'd lose. That happened two out of the three games I played. And that stupid pink flmingo lamp my mom bought haha. I love it. Man, there's just so much to remember I don't want to forget anything so I'm trying to write it down but I still know I'm forgetting LOADS of stuff.   OK, I swear...I'm going now. My neck, my back, lick my.....  Wow, what a dirty song....
