I'm going to go see the musical, Bells Are Ringing. This week was pretty long  but not too bad. The ACT's weren't as bad as I thought they were going to be but they did make me think a little. The PSAE's were a joke. The math section actually insulted my intelligence or lack thereof. If boxes of envelopes cost .09 cents each and you buy 12 boxes, how much do you spend?  And whats funny is that that was the longer of the two tests. Then, today I took the SAT's which weren't too bad. It was all just vocab and math.  Really not difficult stuff. I didn't even have my calculator and I felt fine.   Last night, I babysat for these three kids under 6. Vinnie, the littlest one who's almost two is so adorable! Oh my gosh! He's such a sweet little boy. Then Angela, who's three is...well....ugh. She's going through that stage where she's like, "I'm not getting what I want so I think I'll scream." I was just like, nuh uh, you're not playing that game with me sweetie. I know you and your games. I WAS you. I know your tricks. And then there's Joey who's...really a very nice kid. He's 6 so he's a little less difficult to take care of. He can kind of handle things more on his own. It wasn't too bad I guess but...I don't know, it was stressful. Plus, they have a nine month old puppy who's teething. Gah. That was sort of annoying. Oh well, At least I made some money.   I think Jewel is, A. slowly killing me or, B. slowly taking away my soul. I want to quit so much but something's keeping me from doing it. And one of my many, many bosses, Sharon is an extreme...erm.....bitter woman.  Oh well, I'm not talkjing about Jewel anymore in here...until tomorrow when I have to work 9-2. Gah. Oh well.   Anyway, oh...I also asked Nathan to prom. I think we're going. I have to make sure but I'm pretty sure we are. This should be an interesting experience...  Anyway, I'm off to shower, eat then go out with my friends for the first time in like...weeks!! :)
