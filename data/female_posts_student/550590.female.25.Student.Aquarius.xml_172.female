If you want kids, it’s a privilege to be the one to make sure they’re properly raised.  6) For some reason there is a male-bashing requirement to join that club…Guys rock…without them we’d have to change our own tires, open our own doors, and pay for our own dinners…I  can  do these things, but I   don’t want   to.   7) There’s nothing wrong with being a girl! Okay, I hate my period as much as any of them, but I’m not going to go around announcing it to the world out of anger.   8) Feminists think there’s a double standard between men’s role and women’s roles. I say there’s a double standard between claiming we have “role overload” and wanting to have so many roles. Here are some double standards for you: why are there women’s studies but not men’s studies? Why does the court arrest men for not paying child support but not arrest women who don’t comply with visitation? Why can the courts force men to pay child support but it’s a woman’s “choice” whether or not to have the child in the first place?
