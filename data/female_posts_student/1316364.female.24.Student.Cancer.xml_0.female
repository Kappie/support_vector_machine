The funny thing is that his eighteen month leave didn’t officially start until December 7 so I guess that is the date I should count down from or maybe I should wait until the day he gets overseas, the I can start counting a year from then. This whole thing is so unorganized I am beginning to wonder why these people are in control of our nations security. Everything has been so last minute, which makes me; wonder if I can truly trust them with the health and welfare of my husband let alone 435 other soldiers. How am I going to make sure that he is getting the care that he needs? I guess it bothers me to think that complete strangers are going to be in control of my husband’s life for the next year to eighteen months. I have spent the last six years of my life being in Jesse’s life in one way or the next, we lived together for a little over two years in the apartment that I am slowly packing up. That task has to be the most depressing thing I have had to do ever. I am packing up our life together and stuffing it all in an 10x15x9.5 foot storage with this big steal master-lock to keep it safe. It’s sort of funny to think about it, two years of two peoples life packed away in a storage unit, in just a matter of a few weeks.   I guess I am just really scared. I mean at least the last time Jesse had to go away for military duty he was still in the U.S. which made it a bit easier to deal with him being gone, but now he is going overseas, a place where there is fighting and mass violence, a place where children have semi-automatic guns and women have no rights, a place where Americans really aren’t welcomed. Why would they send our children, husbands, wives, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, parents and cousins to a place where they aren’t wanted? Its just scary to think about it.
