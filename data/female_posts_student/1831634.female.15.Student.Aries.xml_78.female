Which means it'll be four weeks and one day before we can talk to each other again!  =OOOO  DON'T FORGET TO GET ME GIIIIIIIIIIFTS IN CHINA!  HAHAHA I AM SHAMELESS.  I don't know what to say now.  Nothing happened today except that I slept and I ate and I talked to Kailing on the phone for four hours!  Or almost, anyway.  =)  I HAVE A 94 IN ENGLISH HAAAAAAA!  At my rate of improvement in English (3 points per semester), I should be getting an A+ next year!  Hopefully, I'll get a good teacher.  Golden would be lovely.  I WANT TO KNOW WHAT JACK GOT ON THE WORLD HISTORY EXAM DAAAAAAARNIT.  >=(  I should end this on a positive note.  KAILING, I WILL GET YOU LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS FROM CHINA!  INCLUDING BoA CDS/POSTERS!  AND BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGS!!  HAVE FUUUUUUUN!  TALK TO YOU JUNE 24!
