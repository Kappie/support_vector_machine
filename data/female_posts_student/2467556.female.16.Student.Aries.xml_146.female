It was fun, Jake taught me what "snuggle time" was according to the people who went on the mission trip.  I think i'm liking that lol.  Everyone in the whole hot tub decided to have mission trip snuggle time.....i don't think i've ever been that close to people i don't know in my entire life.  The last time i hugged someone i didn't know was when Coppell won State freshman year.  Oh man did Jordan Roach look hot!!!!  He's really really sculpted because he plays soccer i suppose.  I got to talk to him and tell him that i hoped to see him at the World Cup someday, he didn't think he was that good...psh whatever.    Song of the Day: "Penny and Me" by Hanson (yes, the girly boys are back.....but they've grown up, become more masculine and really hott....especially the one named Taylor!)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
