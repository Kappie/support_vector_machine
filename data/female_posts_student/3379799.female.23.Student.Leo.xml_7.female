After a slew of "Shut-up fools," "Girl Hush ya mouths," and "Are you serious?'s" we get off the phone and the thought process begins.  Two diffrent days, two diffrent cities, two diffrent men, yet the madness is the same.  Why do men think that it is okay to do whatever, but can't comprehend a woman who thinks the same.  Let me digress, and further explain myself.    Here we are posed with two men.  Both who seem to think that if the "plan," is not going as they intended, it ain't happening.  "Gal"-ing up hoes in public, sleeping with random people, yet they do not understand why a girl is not trying to hear the "relationship" word.  This is just plain tom-foolery(LOOK IT UP!!).  I mean really, in my case, did you think that telling me you loved me was going to pop the elastic out of my drawls.  At least get a n_gga a burger too.  And for my girl's "jewel(Razzle Bedazzle)", did you really think that bringing a chick to a bar was going to WOW my girl.  Come on.  She has her limits, and you definitely crossed that.  Any way, my Do Better!! for the day is, why would I buy a car I have not testdriven.  You have to make me want you.  I need to check your milage(past realtionships), your miles per gallon(how much does it take to get you going), your speedometer(slow down for me, well u movin too fast!!), and most importantly, how you feel when I'm drivin ya(you fill in the blank).  If I can't get a try, why would I buy.  Show me something.  DO BETTER!!!
