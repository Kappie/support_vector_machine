I was at the music school at rehearsal and lessons from 8 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon, and then had a recital at 5:30.  I made one mistake on the first piece I played. That is, one wrong note, which I corrected right away. I talked to my mom after the recital:  Me: Mom, what did you think?  Mom: You messed up.  Me: Yeah, but it was only one note and it was probably because I was tired.  Mom: You shouldn't mess up.  Me: ...  Mom: I'm going home, you drive with Nikita.  I didn't think too much of this, because this is usually what happens after performances...if she says anything, it's "you messed up". I don't really mind it though, because my teacher gives me the real feedback, and I was happier than usual with how I performed.  When I got home with my brother, I looked around the house for my mom, and found her in a room downstairs lying down. When I asked what was wrong, she said "I'm very depressed because you don't practice enough and you go up there and make a fool out ofyourself."  I don't know if I should have, but I just left the room because I didn't want to argue with her. I went to my room and slept for a few hours and I woke up around 10...my mom had gone out by herself. She just got back about 40 minutes ago. I tried to talk to her but I don't think it's any use. I told her that I was sorry that I messed up, but she didn't reply...about 5 minutes later she told me to go away, so here I am.   Sometimes I wish that she would be proud of me for things. I'm know that I'm not. I always feel that I need someone else to be happy with me no matter what I do. Somehow I'm not yet capable of being happy with my actions or accomplishments (or lack thereof).  I honestly wouldn't stress about the stupid recital if she hadn't done that. I don't know. It's too late to call anyone and I don't know what I'd say anyway. I don't think I can sleep. I might go to the beach in a few hours if I can't sleep. I need cleansing bad.  I'd rather be angry than whatever I am right now. At least anger can be directed at someone. I don't know what this mess is and I don't know how to deal with it right now.  i need a hug...
