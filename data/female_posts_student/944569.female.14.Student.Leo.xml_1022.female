    
       I had a very boring Take Our Kids to Work day too, Adam.  I sat through 4 meetings and a job interview and we had to leave the house at 6:45!!  And now I have a very important announcement... TOMMORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY!!!!  Locker 96, everybody, hint, hint, especially you, Adam!!  I'm pretty sure you'd be reading the blog tonight so if you're there right now, go make me a card!!  Heehee...  SO EXCITED!!
