Give me go-go boots. now  As of now my halloween costume consists of: white mini-dress with bold neon orange and pink stripes, chunky white gaudy plastic necklace and clip-on earrings (sad, I know, one of my many goals in life is to get at least four piercings as soon as I turn eighteen), opaque tights of some kind or another, and fake eyelashes. All I need is a huge headband and go-go boots, *sigh*  In other news, my grades continue to make no sense, now that I've aced the last four things I got back in chem, and got Cs on everything in Bio.  I'm hoping that the ADD test dealie says there IS something wrong with me, just so I know it can be fixed......... lalala   Anyways, I cut my hair, and everyone says it makes me look like an eighth grader, even the supposedly devoted boyfriend is less than thrilled.  All this animosity towards my hair is urging me to screw it up even moreso, just as a protest of sorts you know? So this means, dye it snot green and get a pseudo mohawk. I'm sure the guys would just flock to me.  I've noticed that guys have no taste in girls, what's up with that? They pick these really ugly ones, and also decide to like me, so by process of association, I am offended.  Especially when people have really weird old crushes or exes... it makes me wonder if I fit into the category of bad taste girls.    I say that I'm smart but people just think I'm a moron, but judging from what I just wrote, maybe they're right.  lalala  This was a stupid post. yaaaaaaaaay
