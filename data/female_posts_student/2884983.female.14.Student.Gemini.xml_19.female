I am whining, I know but I think I deserve to be able to whine. argh, my wrist hurts, my ear hurts, my neck hurts fuck it all I just hurt.  You see this is how I really am. I am a bitter old thing that doesn't like anything but animals Illenips and music. oh and pens. but other than that I hate everything. well right now I do. gaarrrr.
