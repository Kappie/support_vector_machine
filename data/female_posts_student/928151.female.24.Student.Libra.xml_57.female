What bugs me is that you believe what you're saying What bothers me is that you don't know how you feel What scares me is that while you're telling me stories You actually believe that they are real  And I got no illusions about you Guess what I never did And when I said When I said I'll take it I meant I meant as is  Just give up And admit you're an asshole You would be in some good company And I think you'd find that your friends would forgive you Or maybe I am just speaking for me  When I look around I think this, this is good enough And I try to laugh At whatever life brings Cuz when I look down I just miss all the good stuff And when I look up I just trip over things  I've got no illusions about you Guess what i never did When I say When I say I'll take it I mean I mean as is      Willing To Fight  Lyrics  The windows of my soul are made of one way glass don't bother looking into my eyes if there's something you want to know, just ask I got a dead bolt stroll where I'm going is clear I won't wait for you to wonder I'll just tell you why I'm here  'cause I know the biggest crime is just to throw up your hands say this has nothing to do with me I just want to live as comfortably as I can you got to look outside your eyes you got to think outside your brain you got to walk outside you life to where the neighborhood changes  tell me who is your boogieman that's who I will be you don't have to like me for who I am but we'll see what you're made of by what you make of me I think that it's absurd that you think I am the derelict daughter I fight fire with words words are hotter than flames words are wetter than water  I got friends all over this country I got friends in other countries too I got friends I haven't met yet I got friends I never knew I got lovers whose eyes I've only seen at a glance I got strangers for great grandchildren I got strangers for ancestors  I was a long time coming I'll be a long time gone you've got your whole life to do something and that's not very long so why don't you give me a call when you're willing to fight for what you think is real for what you think is right     Used To You  Lyrics  I'm still here because I've got nothing else to do you're an asshole but I'm getting used to you I like the fact that you talk incessantly I got a thing for assholes who tell good stories  I think that drinking is the only thing that you do right you're gonna self-destruct I think that's what I like you like me so you try and make me feel like shit I think it's kind of funny yeah I kind of enjoy it  if you're gonna do it, overdo it that's how you know you're alive go ahead, take yourself a coma nap take a puddle dive  you said, this is my bedroom window you said, this is my view you said, lie down here with me and see the things that I do like you were trying to tell me something about the way you live like you would give me something if you had something to give  and for all your talk you don't say much that's real I think I know more than you about the way that you feel I understand your anger and your apathy I think if I was you, you're who I'd be  I'm still here 'cause I got nothing else to do you're an asshole but I'm getting used to you I could love you, yeah I've entertained the thought but I could never like you so I guess I'd better not     The Waiting Song  Lyrics  your basic average super star is singing about justice and peace and love and I am glaring at the radio, swearing saying that's just what I was afraid of the system gives you just enough to make you think that you see change they will sing you right to sleep and then they'll screw you just the same  but I will wait yes, I will wait for the truth  they think I make a big deal about nothing but they still think I'm kinda cute they joke about the staus quo to break the ice once the ice is broken I hope they all fall through 'cause this is no joke to me they don't fool me with their acts of sensitivity they too shall pass just like everyone who's only here for my ass  and I can't wait oh I can't wait til they get their due  baby I've only got a minute baby I have to go a minute is all my life will ever allow let's grow old and die together let's do it now because you'll do all the jobs no one else will do and you'll step aside and you will let me come through you have all my respect I'll leave it here when I go maybe I never told you, baby maybe you don't know  but maybe if we wait if we wait things will improve maybe we just wait and things will improve you know, they've got to improve  your basic average superstar is singing about justice and peace and love and I am glaring at the radio swearing saying that's just what I was afraid of the system gives you just enough to make you think that you see change they'll sing you right to sleep and then they'll screw you just the same  he says I know you have to go you have gone before we are fighting on two different fronts of the same war but no matter what else I will do I will wait for you
