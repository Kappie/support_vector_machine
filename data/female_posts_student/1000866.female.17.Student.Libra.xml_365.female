Anyway, tonight was fun. I went out with Kathryn, Chris and Nikki. It was cool.  And, the BEST thing of all....ok, my mom was all like, "No, you can't go out until you finish cleaning out your room." I was supposed to do this like a week ago haha, but anyway, my mom's NEVER like that. She's really laid back and she never keeps me from going out to do chores and stuff, and so I figured I'd be inside all night, and then my mom's friend called and was like, "yeah, your mom called and left me a message that she needed a ride somewhere so, can you call her cell phone and figure out what's going on and call me back." So, I called her and she was like, "I'm at the doctor." And, I just seriously completely freaked out, because usually when parents don't tell you these things, it means something bad. I just kept thinking. "Oh my gosh, my mom's seriously sick, what am I going to do?" And so I ask my dad and he's like, no, she's fine seriously and all this stuff. They are SUCH  good liars. So, my mom comes home and I go down, and they're both acting ALL serious, and then they give me the keys and ahhh!!!!!! It was seriously the best surprise ever, and even better, I don't have to pay for my insurance because the insurance my mom found is SO cheap. YaY!  Anyway, I guess I'm going to go sleep now.
