I also only got a 3 in psychology. But hey on the bright side I did pass.   I had a lot of fun last night. I stayed up until three, which is actually the latest I've stayed up all summer. Weird. Moving on now, I got bored last night. I was looking up the meaning of names because I can, and then I'd put my name back together from the meanings so my whole name means laurel (tree) by a lively running water. I had some time on my hands because after that I did almost all my friends if I happened to know their full name.
