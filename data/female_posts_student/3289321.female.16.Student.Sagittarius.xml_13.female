I'm going on a mission trip to Pineville, KY in June, going to the beach at some point (maybe with Megan), and moving to Charleston probably in late July.  I'm not exactly looking forward to the last part, but it'll be alright.  I feel like God's telling me that it's where He wants me and my family.  It really is a good situation for my rents and Bo.  We've got a game today (at home) against HHS...we'd better win, haha.  They're horrible.  Hey, maybe I'll actually get to play today, that'd be a nice change, lol.  Well, I'm gonna go for now being as I am in computer class at the moment.  By the way, happy birthday Benny B!!  :)  Later
