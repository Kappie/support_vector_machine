( ive finally managed to find pics of a golliwog.. with an interesting article to go with it .. http://www.ferris.edu/news/jimcrow/golliwog/    i mean, who was the china doll to fall in love with this golliwog anyways?   okay lah.. i better stop now before i get too 'jiwang'. but sayang.. i will miss you TERRIBLY .. and in a way, at least i will be kept occupied with preparations for the dreaded finals. and yes, you are right .. thank your lucky stars you wouldnt be around during this coming next few weeks.. the monster in me would probably emerge way before the 'crimson tide' season and kill you before 'orang itu' does .
