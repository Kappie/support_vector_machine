I am scared I have never had two guys like me at once...That I have known of! One of them I know I would NEVER date but still I thought we were friends! Well maybe both of them I would never date but I don't know! I kind of just want to have a guy friend I can talk to about everything and not worry about them thinking that they never have a chance or they are jealous of some other guys.  I had a jealous boyfriend once and it sucked because he hated my best guy friend!!! I really don't know what to do about all of this.  Why are crushes or boyfriends or whatever so hard to understand or  talk to! It's like now that I know they like me its like they don't want to talk to me or something! Its so weird! I am so not ready to grow up.  I think I am going to stick with being just friends with all the guys I know so that this doesn't screw up anymore friendships. I also found out the other day that my BEST GUY FRIEND woulnd't mind being more then friends.  Now what do you do about that? I am spending the rest of my summer with him and I have kind of had feelings for him since I met him two years ago but this is so hard! I never know what to do about guys! Mostly this one because we both said that we didn't want to be more because we were scared that we would hurt our friendship.  I have so many mixed emotions about guys right now I don't know what to do or say........I really hate this!!! Crushes SUCK ASS!!!!! They screw up everything!!!  I also talked to a really good friend of mine from the 3rd grade today! Man did I miss her! Holy I talked to her and her family and her have changed so much! I even invited her to my 16th birthday only 3 days away!!:D Michelle I am so excited for you to come! Your birthday is tomorrow so this should be great!!  Later Gator.
