I was very reluctant to get ready for work and the bus ride there seemed to last an eternity and its only 10:41 and I have only been at work since 10:00. My alarm was set for 7:00 am and I was rudely awoken by my mom’s jerk of a boyfriend because supposedly my cat “barfed” (in his words) all over the kitchen floor. Now even Jesse and my mom know it takes me a little while to get up in the morning, especially when someone and not my alarm are waking me up. So maybe 5 minutes later I am still in my bed trying to regain consciousness. Now My alarm clock is set so that the time is 15 minutes fast, so in actual reality it was probably 6:45 when he came back to my room and banged on my door for the second time… telling me this time he couldn’t get ready because of the cat barf all over the kitchen floor…. About 5 minutes later I finally get up, this time he is yelling at me from the kitchen… I get some shorts on and sluggishly drag myself into the kitchen to see what the big deal is about… I say all but 3 words to him “Where is it?” Looking around the room there was obviously not barf all over the floor… and he told me by the birdcage. So I walked over to the cage and sure enough there was a hairball, but not from my cat it was from my mom’s, just trust me when I say I could tell the cats are 2 different colors, any way I said to him, “This isn’t even from my cat it’s from Nash” and all he could say was “oh.” I cleaned it up and drug my butt right back into my room where I went back to sleep, waking up around 8:00. You see I haven’t been sleeping well due to my allergies/cold and the fact that it has been getting more and more like summer. I really didn’t need to start my day like that and I did wind up telling my mom all that had happened. I just can’t wait until this whole thing is over with because I am slowly but surely being reminded why I moved out in the first place, Mike. He is such a pain in my arse and I really do wish that he would just leave and never come back..  Well I am going to make sure that this is not how my blog will end today so I plan on writing again later, maybe at lunch.
