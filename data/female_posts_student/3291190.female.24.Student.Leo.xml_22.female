Sooo...Rob, Evan  I went to watch some music at Newby's. Around midnight we all went  crashed back @ Evan's place. The next morning I woke up to knocking on Evan's wall. His neighbor was yelling "call your sister!!!" This really confused me b/c he doesn't know my sister. So I went out to find Rob (he was sleeping on the couch) only, he wasn't there anymore,  neither was my phone???????? what the hell! So I went over to the neighbors house,  he told me that I needed to call my sister right away b/c my Dad was in the hospital (he has blood clots, diabetes, high BP, etc.) I freaked out...went back to my apartment  found Rob asleep on my steps....w/ my phone. He had wandered off in the night,  eventually found his way back to my apt.  Soooo, I am waiting on my dad to come out of surgery to find out if I need to go home. Finally I decided that I should just go home. I call my sister to let her know what I am doing  she tells me that SHE is on her way to the hospital!!!! she is passing kidney stones.....SHIT! So i decided to stay here  make sure that she was ok. At this point I have started to get sick with a cold that Rob  stress has given me. (***I do have to pause to say that I am fortunate in all of this b/c I am not the one suffering in the hospital****) So last night, Rob, Evan  I are all cooking dinner. I am still worn out from my cold  decide to stay here. While Rob  Evan go out to watch a Jazz band play. I am woken up @ 8am this morning, Rob knocking on my door. He told me he lost Evan last night, slept on a park bench  then walked 7 miles back to my place! I was furious! I couldn't believe that Evan didn't watch out for him. Well...around 10am I get a phone call from Evan....hes in jail.....
