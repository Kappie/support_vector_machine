I'm going to New York this weekend!  I got my oil changed this past weekend.  Ummm.  I did my laundry.  And went shopping.  A week from tomrrow, I'll be in Charleston (followed by Orlando, Miami, then CRUISE!)  Then I come back and start surgery.  At that point, I'm sure I'll have a lot to say, but I'll be much too busy to say it.  I had an idea yesterday, but I forgot what it was...  I'm giving up carbs for a week.  I think this diet works simply because there is NOTHING TO EAT.  I went to the  urlLink state psychiatric hospital yesterday .  It looked like a college campus.  Suppose that's some sort of indication of college life?  That's all.
