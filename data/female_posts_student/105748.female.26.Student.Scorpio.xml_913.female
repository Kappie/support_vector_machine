But dad, if you are here, do not click on the link!  I'm gone for a few days and look what I missed!  This is crazy, crazy stuff.  I mean, I can see the teacher being doubtful if you were the only one who was late because of that wreck.  They've probably had their share of excuses -- but to have six people with the same experience?  Obviously it happened.  I think they need to show some compassion and flexibility.  Let me know how it goes.
