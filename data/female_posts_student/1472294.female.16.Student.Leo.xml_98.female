We watched T3, a bit slanted and not focused, but other than that, I am able to watch and understand the movie. Except, I don't like the ending, it is like X- Men 2, where Jean Grey died just like T 101 died. ... ...  Hiaz... I am supposed to wait for my tution teacher, but where is she? I have not idea... (-_-)ZzZ  Today, Thanksgiving a.k.a Speech Day started at 9 am, I think they are finishing soon... Feel a bit lost, maybe should have gone to watch them....
