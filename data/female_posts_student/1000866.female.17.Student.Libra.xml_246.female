Be more independant, be less...I don't know, nerdy?? Seriously, what loser stays up until 2:00 in the morning to read. This loser. That's who. Poo!!  Hmmm, I think I'll call Joanne tomorrow. I want to help clean up after Rib Fest for Young Life tomorrow night.   Tra la la. OK, so, what makes me even more nerdy, is before I go to sleep, I have to come online and see who's on. GOSH, I AM SUCH A LOSER! Ah well, I guess there need to be losers in the world so that cool people can feel cool, and the cycle of life continues. Which reminds me, I want to watch The Lion King. Hmm, I wonder if my tape still works.   OK, now I'm just typing stuff for the sake of typing stuff, because I have fun typing, and because I don't know. Because I'm just continuously typing. Hehe. Wow, I'm so werid. Seriously, I feel bad for my roommate in college, and my husband, and....yikes. Poor guy. I know living with people before you're married is a sin, but I feel like I owe it to my future husband, so that he doesn't want a divorce two weeks after we're married. Haha, funny what you think of at 2:19 in the morning...  Haha. Wow, I'm being weird. I'm talking to Alex. He's usually the only person I talk to at this time of night. But, we're talking about lots of stuff, mostly my scary family. Haha, I love my family so much, but...it's scary. Or, it would be to people outside of it. Haha Man, I can't wait for Michigan.
