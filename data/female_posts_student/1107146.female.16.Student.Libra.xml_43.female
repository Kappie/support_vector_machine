Every time I bring up the point that you've said something along those lines, she's like "You really believe her?" and actually...I do. Most of the time I think it's just me clinging on to a crumbling ledge, but maybe you really are right. Idon'tknowIdon'tknowIdon'tknow. I don't know. I think she does myself.   But then I tell myself, that's just what you want to think, not what really is.   I wish she would just find one she could confide in, that would make things a lot easier for me.  But who said it was going to be easy?
