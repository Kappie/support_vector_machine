It was a really good time to watch it and see where all of the young new talent will be playing in the coming years.  I am still a bit disgruntled about Eli Manning and the San Diego Chargers incident.  Though the fact that Eli went to the NY Giants is a good thing.  Kerry Collins is a average QB at best and I believe that if the Giants are to make anything of themselves in the coming year and subsequent years they will need the fresh talent that Eli Manning brings to their ranks.  Not to mention that just by having the “Manning” name he is expected to be a great!  I know I have high hopes and expectations for him, I only hope he is man enough to live up to the challenges!  On another note, school is drawing to a final end for the semester. This week and one day next week and school will be over for the spring ’04 semester.  Thank the heavens!  I am ready for a break.  My drive to attend class is zip, zero!  I just can’t seem to want to go and it’ going to cause my grades to suffer now, at the end of the semester, and for one reason or another I am having trouble caring.  I am so ready for the summer break to come it’s not even funny!  I am however taking one class in the summer, and I am taking it over the Internet.  I would just like to add that I am not taking one class out of laziness but lack of financial aide for the summer.  Matt’s taking two, both Calculus II and Calculus III.  I have pity for Matt.  There is really not much going other than that.  As I said before we are awaiting the Football season eagerly.  My favorite team of the past has gone rogue on me so I am thinking about taking up a new team, though I am not sure which one yet.  All I can say is “why would you do this to me Jon Gruden!”  To all my friends out there, please email me.  I miss hearing from y’all.  I will be emailing all of you in the next few days.  To those I sent pics to did y’all get them?  I know it’s been a few months but I always like to know if my mail got lost between here and there.  Going…  ~Kristyn
