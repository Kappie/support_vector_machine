I'm happy that I'm not there with her right now cause I'd be snapping out and forcing answers out of people. Fuck this 'I'm too busy right now for you' attitude they've been carrying around. GRRRRRRRR.  Gus is out and hiding my socks. I feel like I want to die. Hopefully someone will go for coffee with me, I feel like a hermit. My legs hurt so bad I want to cut them off. At least my fish and ferrets are still alive.   I'm going to read now.
