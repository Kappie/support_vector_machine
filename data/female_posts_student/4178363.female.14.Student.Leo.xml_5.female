Like when you wanna say, "I had always liked you." or "Go ahead, make my day, go and die if you want to, migrate, change school or what lar..." Okay... Maybe SMSes have their bad points... as in coz they can allow one to talk all sorts of mushy crap or harsh crap without making facial contact~! Whee...      Today...   ...I was sent to the "detention room" (well, not the detention room itself coz there were no girls, only boys in there, and things can be dangerous in those situations, if you know what I mean) and I had to spend 2 hours in there doin' nothin' at all... Boring... Yeah, I know it really doesn't seem like girls get into much trouble, but I guess I'm different in a (-ve) aspect *dratz!*... I kept lookin' at my watch, counting each second as the clock went on tickin' and I just kept starin' and starin' and starin'...... and stari.... n'.... *snore*... I got so bored at slept awhile, I guess... Then I woke up and it was still an hour more to go *>.   5... 4... 3... 2... 1... YES! =D 2 hours completed! I almost tripped myself from jumpin' outta the "detention room"~ I still had to wait... CO [Chinese Orchestra] wasn't over... and I sorta promised my "jie" that I was going to wait for her until CO finished (don't ask, I was bored)... bo liao or whatever... that's me...   And so, there I was waiting for "the Chinese Orchestra room" *There's no such thing, it's the Art Room. Chinese Orchestra doesn't even HAVE their own room XD unlike band!* door to open wide so that I could go home with my dear Jie who's hands were so painful, they probably were about to drop off, literally (Ahhh!!! Drop-hand girl! Nooo, the hand is wriggling!!! Argh! *pukes*). Anyway, so there I was, minding my own business when so many ppl passed by me and I was so paiseh, standing there doin' nothin' at all (///O///O/// *blush*)...   At around 6 they were released and my "jie" came lookin' for me (so touched!! *Jie: Eh, it was u hu ask me 2 look for you leh... -.-; lll  ) and we both left the place, the dreadful, dreadful place called school...And that's just about it... =)       ©2004 LeoVYN.
