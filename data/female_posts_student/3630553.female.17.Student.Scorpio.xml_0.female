Unfortunately, I still have 2 essays to do. Hay... I barely had time to do these acad-stuff over the weekend. And now I'm squeezing my brain to extract some ideas for my reaction paper.    Arggh!   Studying really sucks!  ... Sorry, nerds.   My weekend was so restless!   My cousin just celebrated her 18th birthday with these bunch of teenagers who speak like Heart Evangelista and Kris Aquino. Ah, and did I feel out of place! Anyways, the food was good, plus the loud music and the disco to end the formality of the program. I must say, it was a cool party after all.    Hay...   I'm really tired. I feel drained.  Ugh!  And a few hours from now, I'd be packing my stuff back to my bording house in the campus. Phew! Don't I ever get a rest? Anyways, the thought that I'm restless - keeps me smiling in a way. At least I'm getting my life in action.    *Yawns*  Good Morning, people!
