(london thinks she is ready for tall buildings.)  i understand that you could use a little extra space and besides covering the thames with concrete (or riding yourself of the tate modern) you have no were else to go but up.   but let me let you in on a little secret: all of the people who knew how to build in your country, their great-great-great grandchildren have long since rotted away in your soil.   to put it simply,  your people do not know how to build  if they knew how to build it was a recessive trait which has long since ceased to be in the gene pool.   any building you've built since the last century will most likely burn in the next round of city fires, or fall apart in the near future.  hell, the building i lived in when i resided in your beautiful country, caught on fire whilst i was living there and i still wish it had burned to the ground.   it was a building designed with major electrical and heating oversights, as well as additional exits in case the off chance ground floor would've caught on fire. (which it did.)   and all of this occurred in a recently built building.  also your people can not be trusted to design a beautiful building.   i say you use a psychic to contact christopher wren, if you must build anything.  lastly, why must you taint the square mile of historic london?  why must you plan to build things that would conflict with st paul's cathedral?  couldn't you build your tall buildings over by the stupid stupid millennium building?  far enough away that the sky around beautiful london will not be raped by tall buildings.     central london, you are not ready for tall buildings.  nor will you ever be.
