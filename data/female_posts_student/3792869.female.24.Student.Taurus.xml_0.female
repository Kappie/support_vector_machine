He texted me, saying I should ask that girl out or hang out with her or something. He added, he better stop daw "kasi ayokong maging *current love interest* part 2." How do you think I was supposed to interpret it? From what I understood, he was referring to himself and he didn't want to be another unrequited love interest of mine. Diba??? I texted him and told him ang kapal niya if he assumes I'd fall for him (he has a girlfriend kaya, although they hooked up after chatting endlessly and they haven't seen each other for the past 9 years). I added that I would never fall for the girl he was teasing me to because she has a boyfriend and no-no sa 'kin ang taken (ano ako, kabit?).   Robert apologized but said he never meant to assume I'd fall for him. Sa susunod kasi, linawin niya. He's still affected, though. I told him okay na but he kept explaining himself in his text messages. Whatever.  * * *  I'm happy I got to spend a bit of time with another close friend, Sr. Dinah, who will be making her first profession of vows (yes, as a nun) on the 4th of July. She stopped by my apartment to return my CDs, and I ended up accompanying her to the nursing home and community center where she does her ministry. Judy, the old lady to whom Sr. Dinah gave communion, was so charming and sweet. I feel bad that she's really lonely, though. My heart just went out to her when she cried after telling us that being alone wasn't funny. (It's humbling for people like myself who get so caught up in doing their own thing.) So nilambing ko siya. I have a soft spot for elderly people and it's coming out now.   I took pictures of Sr. Dinah "at work." One of the sisters wants to use those pictures for the congregation's website. At least I was able to help out. I've journeyed with Sr. Dinah over the past year or so. Parang ako tuloy yung nag-novice. She has also journeyed with me. We have such a beautiful friendship going. We listen to each other, connect so well, and take turns being big sisters to each other when we have to. I'll be so happy and proud when she says her vows. That's my baby!  * * *  Johnna, my "best Chicago friend," just called and said she was gonna stop by my neighborhood and grab a drink at the Pumping Company, this bar near where I live. I had planned on doing laundry tonight, but maybe I'll squeeze in a drink or two, in between. Oh well. Something to cheer me up and celebrate the end of the day.
