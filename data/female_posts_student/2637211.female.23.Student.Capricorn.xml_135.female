He was at his mom's house, and they got me to pick up Jerm's sister and we all had dinner there in Orinda. It was pretty tasty, but I was so tired after my night of 3.5 hours of sleep (all in daylight), that I was pretty woozy. Jerm and I came home and went to bed by 10:30pm, which I think might be a record for us. And then we slept till 10:00am. It was awesome and I feel well rested. Jerm and I read and screwed around for a while, then we went to a park in Alameda and just laid out on the grass and ate and talked. We watched the sailboats out on the bay, and I realized how lucky we are to live in such a beautiful part of the world. I really do love northern California, especially the bay area. It's just so pretty and pleasant. I need to do some laundry and tidying around the house, then I'm going to make a chicken soup for dinner. I'm feeling very happy and domestic today. Maybe it's all the knitting. I think the only thing that would make me feel more domestic would be if I were knitting baby clothes. But that's a while off. Jerm and I were talking and I think 26 is an ideal age for that. Oh, fat little babies, with pink cheeks, blue eyes and baby breath. Babies smell so good and sweet... I just need to hold out for a few more years. Hmm. Speaking of which, I need to go take my pill. Eek!
