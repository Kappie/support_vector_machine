So stupid...its prolly the damn principal who makes us leave early like that. My legs hurt...so does my left arm for some reason.  Bill got new bunny rabbits! They are soooo cute. We were thinking up names like dumb and fuck lol and shit and head...or bend and over but we decided to call the black one satan. I was like....he's not satan...just black and bill was like...here nigger! lol I might stay home tomarrow....i didn't want todo my homework so...we'll just say its 'religious' reasons lol.   Man...i woulda wanted to hear the colors in Latin lol. I prolly woulda been laughing more than ryan lol. And...ryan..how was i flirting with him?!   Countdown till Yellowcard concert!
