You are probably all wondering why I chose to do a topic on “why I hate girls” even though I am a girl myself. Well as I go further into my presentation you will come to understand why, and you may change your own point of view as well.        In the past, I have had my share of friends and enemies many off which were girls. After so many years I have finally come down to one point...I really dislike them. Of those who I befriended, I only have about four friends who are girls and for the rest have disappeared simply or became my enemy all of which were because of very stupid reasons. When I speak about girls, I do not make myself an exception, I only speak for every typical girl out there. First of all, if you’ve ever sat down and had a decent conversation with a girl, you will notice that everything that comes out of her mouth is gossip, nothing but.  I guess gossips are fun for a little bit when you join a group of girls and laugh along making mean and nasty comments until you realize that you are the star of the rumor, you are the one they’re talk about, the one they bring down and the one that has just been stabbed in the back. If that has ever happened to you before you have all of my respect. Also, it is almost guaranteed that any rumor that has been spread around the school about you or anyone else, was started by a girl.        Have you ever shown a girl a picture of your puppy only to find yourself plugging your poor ears trying to drown out the bloodcurdling shriek coming out of her mouth? Tip: never show a girl something cute if you want to spare your ears. Well.. becoming deaf could be good and bad.. it goes both ways. I mean, you would lose your hearing but at least your days of listening to a girl talk is over. If you see a bug on the street prepare to plug your ears, but if you kill it for her.. umm ..plug your ears once again. That’s right no matter what you do you are never going to satisfy a girl. After all, she IS a princess or that’s what she thinks.       If you have ever insulted a girl you will never hear the end of it, not after many many years, she will forever hold a grudge on you even if you apologize a billion times, and shower her with gifts she’ll always bring up that time you might have accidentally called her fat. That’s just how a girl is, even after many years I don’t know what it takes for her to forgive and forget and finally move on. I guess with a girl she will only ever give you one chance but for her you are suppose to give her many chances or she’ll cry till you give in. Don’t tell me you have never given in to a crying, sobbing female. Yah that’s right. Never piss a girl off, you will never hear the end it. However, if you chose to give her a compliment..  you might want to be careful with that as well. If you call a girl pretty, they sometimes run to their friends and tell them that you have a crush on her and eventually you are going to get called a stalker. Be careful! You’ve heard the line a way to a girls heart is to make her laugh. Because some girls cannot take a joke, you might want to be cautious while doing so. This leads us back to the fact that girls will hold grudges on you even though you were only joking and explained that many time to her, she is too ignorant to realize that since she thinks the world evolve around her and only her.       Some people say girls make great friends, I on the other hand have concluded that girls are great backstabbers. One minute they’re your friend, the next they will be talking about you behind your back or ditching you for the popular girls leaving you all by your lonesome wondering why. I’ve had my experience of backstabbers and it is not pretty. They tell you lies, and they tell you things you want to hear when really they mean the total opposite. If you ever tell a girl a secret, prepare for everybody to know about it the next day. If you ever come to her feeling down, hoping she’ll give you some good advice you might want to reconsider. She’ll either be too busy spending 5 hours on her hair just to go out and walk her dog, or she’ll be too busy dressing up her Barbie doll to really even care what you have to say. Somehow though, you’re suppose to care for her when she comes to you with a problem... shows how great a friend girls are huh?            Last few tips from you to me: Never take a girl shopping. You will have to wait for her to try on 50 different articles of clothing but only to find her buying nothing in the end. Never tell a girl to open a pop can for you.. she might break a nail and once she does you’re done for.           So if your reputation is ruined by rumors, you became deaf, or backstabbed by a girl don’t tell me I didn’t warn you. If we were to wipe out all the squeal, annoying, gossipy, grudge holding, backstabbing females in the world... there’d be no girls left.
