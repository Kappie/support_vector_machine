If I could just see You Everything will be alright. -Lifehouse, "Storm"  Maybe someday I can learn to trust You And just stop thinking with my head Cause maybe someday I could learn to let go I lose control but that's okay with me I lose control but tell me what is wrong with that   Why do I have to know everything And why does everything always have to make sense Why do I always have to have You figured out Cause I just want to take Your hand    Cause You say if I fall I will Fall straight into Your arms Should I trip over my feet And if I start to slip I will Slip right onto my knees Into the center of Your hands.  -Lifehouse, "What's Wrong With That"
