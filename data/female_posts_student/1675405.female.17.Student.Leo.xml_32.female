Wade asked me, and in doing so, I assumed that he'd care enough to even talk about it. He's paying, at least I hope so, and therefore I do not think that I am entitled to make any choices. Him not talking about anything is telling me that he doesn't want to go with me, and you know I wouldn't be too surprised if that actually was the case. I should have known that this is his way of practically going with Heather. But I swear to God, if the 18th comes around, and I have no fun, I think I'll pull all of my hair out... I have spent entirely too much time hoping things will work out well.  Things around here are crazy, and I hate to complain, but it gives me bad feelings to even think about it. There is so much tension between everyone, and I don't like being here. I'm much more comfortable at school, and that is crazy! I'd much rather be around those strangers than my own family?! That's is wrong, but I can't help it; it's how I feel.  But on a more positive note, Mrs. Payne gave me (along with 3 others) a lovely thank you note and a $30 gift certificate for the Ashtabula Mall this morning, which is absolutely wonderful because I really need that money for some stuff for homecoming. There it is again, that dreaded H-word! I need to stop, I think it's all this nervous energy flowing through these fingertips of mine.
