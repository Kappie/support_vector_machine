Actually...its not so much as an address as it is a rambling.  I think Satpreet has passed her writers block onto me. Maybe its like a cold (writers block, that is): it just travels around person to person.   ho hum....  Why do I have to be such a procastinator??  Its 9:30 and I still have to pack.  I need something to occupy me....I need to find my niche in life.... Can I borrow someone's?  Also...this entry is going all ADD on me.  Random thoughts running through my crazy mind: ~ I need to read those two books mom gave me. 'Waiting for Snow in Havanna' and 'Second Glance'. I have been considerably behind in my reading, but I did finish 'The Catcher in the Rye'.  ~ Houldin Caulfield is possibly the best character ever. ~ Seth Cohan on the OC is second place. ~ Wait...no...its a tie... ~ The blog I found today is really interesting....it again makes me realize how much more I need to learn. ~ Jack Johnson's voice is soothing. ~ I bet Kelly is freaking out right now at 'The Secret Window'. ~ Note to self: Try to overcome the fog known as writers block....Lists are BORING.  I suppose that is it.  I sincerly wish everyone a happy, sunny, liberating Spring Break!   Song of the Day: 'Taylor'- Jack Johnson
