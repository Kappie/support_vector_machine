I guess I should write that this is my first entry into this blog in which I have no idea why I writing in it. Oh well, I guess things could be worse. I could be completely drunk and have no idea what I was writing. That would definitely be worse than not knowing why I'm writing. Which reminds me... I'm just joking for all those concerned or I am... Life is good at the moment, things could change though. Sleep is good and that's what I'm gonna do. I have to go play golf tomorrow and need all the sleep I can get.   "The doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live." -Flora Whittemore
