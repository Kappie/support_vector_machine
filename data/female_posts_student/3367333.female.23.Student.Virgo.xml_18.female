"many recovered memory narratives resemble the heroic narratives of men, while introducing different protagonists, plot structures, and denouments. in the sexual abuse recovery movement, the subtext is mourning a lost male protector [. . . .] and a felt absence of adequate restorative possibilities" (Janice Haaken,  Pillar of Salt , 56). why is a male protector necessary in the first place? not only for me, not only for other survivors of abuse, for anyone? the very necessity casts us in the role of the victim, before we are even victimized. and the 'feminist' heroic narrative? so, instead of a hero there's a heroine. does that change the way story functions -- it's propagandistic social role? if the heroine behaves in the traditional way, she is acted upon; if she refuses that role, she replicates the traditional heroic narrative, acting upon others and upon the world, colonizing the other and the world. i don't want to write that story.  (but what other?)  how, i wonder, is it possible to write story otherwise. and, dr. h., what does it mean to replicate a narrative form -- the heroic narrative you cite -- while introducing new protagonists, plot structures, and denouments? does that not constitute a new story? and is such a thing possible? is it possible, for example, to write a heroic narrative and have the heroine be less heroic? is it possible to write a human as heroine without eclipsing her humanity, without romanticizing her? would the narrative remain recognizable? do i want to read a recognizable narrative? isn't my distaste for therecognizable the reason i gravitate toward highly experimental texts? do i want to write a recognizable narrative?  the correct answer is, only if you want people to read it ms. em.
