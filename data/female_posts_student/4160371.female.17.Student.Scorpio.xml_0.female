My last  phone call over the speaker to the whole store  where I mess up and say ummuuhhhppaaaaahhhhuhhhhhhhhh p---paaaa---pPacker Please!!!! ---and slam the phone down not wanting the guy to come help me pack the groceries at all anymore, no matter how long the line and how grumpy the customers. My last goof-up where I say  $2,000.00 DOLLARS PLEASE --- oops I must have made a mistake somewhere ---and then the lady shrieks while I peer over the reciept and find where I typed in a price to one thing, didnt press enter or whatever and continued putting in prices making a long string of numbers.... not good.... I only worked at the IGA a little over a month. I never even memorized all the different pops! (whether they belong to the pepsi or coke price category). I'm still puzzled about Squirt. Hmm...  Last night I had a dream about this guy. This guy  I knew in high school . HA. That sentence comes so naturally yet I feel like an old person writing that. (Come on though---I just graduated!) In my dream he had an "I WISH I WAS IN ADVANCED CALC" personality and I had an outgoing, laid back personality---in real life its the total opposite. I like to think I'm laid back---and I am out of the school/work scene---but I  DID  WISH I WAS IN ADV CALC last year!!! ---->>>In the dream we also fell in love, blah-biddy-blah.  Today went pretty well at work (surprisingly). Although I did find out that there is a set time people are supposed to have lunch break when they work the 11-7 shift. MAN. Today was the first time the girl on the register next to me didn't say, you can go to lunch now----so I didn't go till 2:45. Geez!!! NO ONE TOLD ME!!! Man, was I hungry! Instead of telling me, I asked her and she made me feel stupid saying, you were supposed to go at 1:30...  My roomate hasn't emailed me in 3 weeks. And we move in together in one week. AHHHHH. I've sent her 2 emails since she last wrote me and I'm not going to write anyMORE till she writes me! Hopefully we get along along better in person.
