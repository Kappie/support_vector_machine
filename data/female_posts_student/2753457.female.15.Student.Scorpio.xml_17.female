And you can see the Radiohead lyrics better.   Hahahahaha, I had a dream about that song the other night.  I was in the Baz Luhrmann version of "Romeo and Juliet."  Well, actually, I was on the set.  And they were filming the elevator makeout scene.  And the way that they filmed it was really cool.  They actually did this in real life, according to the DVD.  They built a little space in a warehouse surrounded by these wooden panels that you can lift up.  They had to keep lifting up each panel of the little space so that they could film inside, and then make sure it was down again so that you wouldn't see the other side when the camera came back around.  This way, you get that spinning effect.  Looked really awesome.  Team effort, 'cause if one person screws up, they have to start over.  Bet Claire Danes didn't mind starting over.  Anyway, wow.  "Talk Show Host" was playing, even though I don't think the song is in that scene, but oh well.  The dream didn't actually revolve around Leonardo DiCaprio.  Only the camera did that.  Oh, my, that was a bad joke. But then, I was at the Capulets' wild little costume gig, and Mercutio was dancing around in drag and singing "Young Hearts."  And that's all I really remember.  God, I LOVE Luhrmann.  Definitely a role model for me. Well, now that I totally bored everyone, I'll pretend to be normal. Ugh, still recovering from the effects of secondhand smoke.  We went to the bowling alley tonight.  I didn't bowl.  But it was still fun.  I split a salad with Becca at Brothers, and then had ice cream at Cream and ('N'?) Bean. Yay, my dad finally burned me the Dandy Warhols cd.  I don't remember what the album is called.  Something about monkeys.  The cover of the cd is pretty sweet.  A banana with a frickin zipper on it, and TDW written somewhere, I can't remember that well. I'm tired, I'm going to sleep.  Maybe I'll have another good dream.  Oooh, if I listen to BDB right before bed, maybe something will happen.  Hope so.
