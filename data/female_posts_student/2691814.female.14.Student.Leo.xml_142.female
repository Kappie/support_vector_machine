Found out i dont get my schedule till August 4th!!!! thats a long time. I dont like the highschool...its kinda weird...but weird could be good...uhh hmmm i dont know. I just wanna go to a school of the arts...i coulda gone to one in Manatee, but the parents hated the area. Oh well...just another year of torture right? I think everyones just been through too much and we should all do away with school. but then again thats like my place to get away ya know?...well sometimes..other times its hell.  Pangi,Dad, and I went for a walk last night...talked..family problems>not going into detail, cuz its no ones buisiness.  hmm..seems things are really fucked up right now, everything i think might have a potential to be good, always turns out to be bad. Story of my life. I still dont have my guitar back :( i need to play that thing cuz its like the only thing i did when i was bored. Now i watch tv...send e-mails on the computer..those huge quizzes and such.lol I've noticed that i've been very observant lately...i see everything that goes on nowadays. Ugh and i do that because im bored also. I got the Gary Jules cd...its good...kinda weird tho..i really like that song Mad World. oh god..the Lizzie theme song is playing *stop the insanity!!* im crazy. and loving it. i think im going psyco...i wanna dieeeeeeeeeeee, hmm not really but hey, its worth a shot right!?!?! lot more fun then being here and doing all the things listed above. YAWN...all this boredness is making me tired.  Night Night!!
