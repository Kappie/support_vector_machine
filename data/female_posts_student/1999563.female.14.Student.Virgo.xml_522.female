[i got anew journal!] and I haven't done anything really good this summer. not one thing. I NEED TO DO SOMETHING. That is what summers are for!! Doing good things for others. I don't want to waste my three months sleeping in till 11 everyday. I would wake up, september 6 with only one day of summer leftand I would relaize how I wasted all the free days God gave me. That would really suck. It seems like I can never do anything good. I can never change anyones life..I can't do this..I can't do that..  Hmm. I wish I could just be somebody, somebody important. Maybe I want that for all the wrong reasons. Maybe I just want to make myself look good...i guess i just want everyone to look up to me and be like "Look! there is Laura, she is an amazing person, she changed the world"  *sigh*
