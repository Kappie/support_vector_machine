Working and going to class are taking up most of my time nowadays, in addition to sitting on the porch screaming obscenities with Jess in the late evening-it's a wonderful stress reliever! (don't ask) Also, I've started playing tennis again...I'm no Serena Williams, but I manage to have a good time and get some exercise, while enjoying myself.    Honestly, I don't have much new to report: my life nowadays is remarkably drama-free, consisting of school, work, going out, and occasionally playing nintendo.  I'm currently home for father's day-last night I went out for margaritas and Shrek II with some friends,  and it was fun enough.  Today I worked, then headed home, and currently write this after an evening of catching up and drinking margaritas with Alisha.  Now I'm getting ready for bed...and I don't have much more to say except that the only downfall right now is I'm not sleeping in as much as I would like to.    More later, 'cause it's time for bed.
