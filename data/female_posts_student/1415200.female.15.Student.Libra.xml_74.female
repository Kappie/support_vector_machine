Everyone is basically over, it's gonna be a party! w00t. Yeah, I had  that track meet this morning at like 7:30 til about 6-ish. That was so not fun! But, I didnt get as burned as I did last weekend. Thats a good thing. Im still in a crappy mood from last night. But Im kinda better now. I guess. But not like that matters. I dont care anymore.  I have the get up kids stuck in my head, I really want to talk to somebody in perticular, and I can't which makes me mad, but im not a home, so that makes me un-mad....just a little. Im gonna go. Prolly be back later.  Somebody Save me.
