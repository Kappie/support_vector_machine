Coy and I broke up because it wasn't working out. In August, Scott asked me out, and we broke up... exactly a week later. (7days) He sees me as his little sister, even though we are only 8months and 3 days apart from eachother... He said that he is not ready for a girlfriend, and promised me that he wouldn't go out with another girl, until he was ready. Well, now he and I aren't talking. He won't talk to me. He won't talk to Liz either. Liz says that when he is ready to talk to her, she will talk to him, but when he is ready to talk to me, I am NOT going to talk to him for a while, just to let him see how it feels. He doesn't get it. I will listen to him, but I won't talk to him unless he mentions Rachel, because she went out of her way to help me... But then there is the issue of all the other guys, I mean, seriously! What if one of them asks me out? What should I say?!? I mean, I can see me going out with Jon, but defenately not Brian, or Centure. I can possibly see me going out with Coy or Scott... again... but I am still thinking about it. This is sooooo complicated! Why do I have to go though this, I mean, I found out that 2 more guys like me! There is Robert, a nineth grader... and he has an outline of a 6-pack-abs! Then there is a guy who sat next to me in Science, Zak. He and I aren't going to be in the same science anymore because I am getting my schedule changed, but that is besides the point! Well, I have to go, my bother is calling me to finish dinner!          XOXOXO     Luv Ya Bunchez,     Geneva     XOXOXO
