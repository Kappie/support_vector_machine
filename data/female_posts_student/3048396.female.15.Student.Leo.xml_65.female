Which its still being gay but yeah he got a ton of junk of our comp. But yeah...yesterday...*sigh* Well it started off really bad...I realized I forgot to wear my watch and bracelet. I about died. First time I ever forgot to wear the bracelet. Made me sad. But yeah. Then I had to take my oral test in Spanish and I got an A! a 99.5 percent. Woo. I was super happy about that. In the middle of spanish Tori came! I hadn't seen her since Christmas. But she kinda ignored me for awhile but later we got to talk. So science was gay...so was Algebra. Eh. Then in choir Tracy and I sat there again doing nothing. Fun stuff. Then in band Tori came and sat by me and we talked a lil bit. Then I came home and Kim came over for awhile and then Greg came and stayed 8 hours. I was sooo bored. I didn't have the computer. *sigh* Plus my wisdom teeth are coming in and that gives me killer headaches and I swear my mouth is like swollen. Gur. It sucks. But yeah. Then today not much happened in the morning. Tracy and I went to a choir lesson for our exit test. Holy crap, I didn't know I could sing so high. It was scary. Mrs. Ewen was happy tho. LoL. So then stupid spanish...was boring since ppl were still testing. But we're gonna have a party tomorrow. I have to bring Finding Nemo so we can watch that. Then Science and Algebra was all reveiw today cuz we had big tests tomorrow :$ Eh. I don't care if I fail or pass the algebra test. He said it would only affect our grade my 3 percents. So I'm still gonna stay the same. So yeah. Im not really gonna worry bout it. Then today in Choir and Band I took Tracys phone and she told me to text Jimmy so I did. It was odd. LOL but hes just kinda dumb. LoL then I had to bring my trombone home so Jimmy n Tracy gave me a ride...so yeah...Thats all that been goin on.. Ive gotta go to Sheldon now.
