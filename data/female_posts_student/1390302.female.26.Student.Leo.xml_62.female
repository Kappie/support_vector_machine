While I enjoyed the holidays with my hubby, Matt, Christmas still turned out to be a pain –Literally!  Now don’t get me wrong, we did all of the Christmas “stuff,” gave each other gifts, had a really nice time together –unfortunately this was only after the car accident which totaled our Crown Victoria LX!  AAAHHHHH!!!    While driving home from dropping a friend we had a really, pretty bad car accident, on Christmas Eve!  It sucked, really sucked, and we spent Christmas in some serious pain.  Matt couldn’t move his head from left to right, and his shoulder couldn’t move. My neck hurt, pretty bad!  GGGRRRRR!  We’re feeling better now, thank GOD!  So we had a pretty good New Years.  A friend from Austin came down and spent the week after Christmas with us, which was really, really nice.  He’s a nice guy; we all had a good time hanging out.    On a much better note, school is starting on January 12th and Matt and I are SOOOOO very ready.  We’re both really looking forward to this semester and come May we’re both transferring to a University here in Texas, wish us luck!  I’m going to be an English Major with a duel in Fine Arts.  Matt is going for Physics and Mathematics.    Otherwise, life is good!  I hope y’all had a good Christmas holiday and a Happy New Year!  I must say that so far 2004 is looking up, it should be a better year than 03’ was…hopefully.    ~ Kristyn
