But I don't know how to get out of this slump.  I know what I need to do to lose the weight, but I come up with excuse after excuse...well lately, they have been real excuses, I haven't been feeling well with the vertigo and headaches...  I don't know how I got here...I want to get out though.  I hate being heavy.  Anyway, I am done.
