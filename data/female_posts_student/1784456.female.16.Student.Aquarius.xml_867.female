So meet up today aargh to see MIB2, I wonder if any one will actually come... We did kind of arrange it last minute didn't we! Not like any one would come any way, or would they? Ok... so erm Izzy isn't coming... I might as well phone Claire and cancel seeing as no one else is gonna turn up, be funny if they did though! Herm, to cancel or not? Aaargh, I need more sleep! Hmm... I'll go figure bubi.
