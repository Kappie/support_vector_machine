Then we went to my house and drank what we had left from the other night, then went to DQ.  After that I took him home and I went home because I thought I would be able to take a nap, but I couldn't so I took Bugzy for a walk, and took a longgg bubble bath.  Then NATHAN was  suppose  to call me but he never did so I found him on AOL chitchatting away.  Hmm..let's see...oh ya, after I talked to him, I went over to his house, Only to find the X Box Junkies (Mike, Chad, and Nate) playing away at their game.  So I sat there awhile and annoyed Nate because he was only paying attention to his GAME and not me!  Oh well, you know how guys and their games are, I guess...lol. After that, I went to my grams and spent the night.    As for today...   I'm waiting for Natron to finish getting ready.  We are gonna go eat @ Hardscrabble, and then go fishing, because he is DYING to go, even though I think it is gonna rain! Ooooh well.  I'm in a good mood, ONLY because I don't have to work today!!!!! ((And because I'll be able to spend some time with Nathan, since he IS my husband and all..lol))  Well, I'm gonna go "freshen up", and hopefully Nate will be ready to roll, or I'm leaving, without him!                                                 -:- Courtneyyyyyyyy -:-
