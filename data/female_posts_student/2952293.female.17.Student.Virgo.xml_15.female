Anyways, this year has been super busy, as all you fellow unicorns know, but we are less than a quarter left to go until May Program and summer, and then... SENIORITIS BABY! I am really excited for that.  So last night the scariest thing happened. I was talking on the phone and suddenly the lights started flickering on and off very quickly. Then, the TV blasted on and it was VERY loud! So, I put the phone down and shut off the TV. When I came back, the phone kept making clicking noises and when I looked at the caller ID box, it was in a foreign language! Then my mom suddenly arrived home and screamed out my name, all causing me to go into hysterics. I asked Doc about it today, to see if there was any scientific reason that all that stuff would happen at once, his response: "I think God hates you!" Well there you have it folks, my genius chemistry teacher is crazy! I am really excited because I'm going with Meghan to see j. rev on Thursday (for all you crazy kids out there who don't know, that is Junior Revolution), but I'm tight with the band, see? So I am able to call them j. rev. I've titled myself their Columbus spokesperson, so everybody check out http://www.juniorrevolution.com and listen to their songs, they are really good! But I am a little nervous since I have two tests the next day in Pre-Calc and Chemistry, oh dear I'm pretty much done. I've been preparing all week so I won't leave my major studying until Thursday, but alas the stress of a unicorn is much to handle.  I'm freaking out for comments which are coming soon, I have figured out what all my teachers will say:  Dr. Doden: "Allison, geez, what can I say? She is always hanging around me trying to get in my good graces, but I'm sorry, her lack of an ability to reach a thesis is just too much for me to like her. Oh and even though I told you on your last paper you had a thesis, I LIED! Which was evident when you got your paper back and it said 'thesis is WEAK'."  Mrs. Potts: "I'm not sure if Allison is just tired second period, or if she is really that slow. I ask her simple things and she can't even follow them. She needs to work on that, because it's embarrassing for herself."  Mr. O'Grady: "Oh Allison, even though I know it pisses you off when I call you a Republican, ha you are! Yeah that is right, you are shame to your whole family, did you guys know that? Allison's great uncle was the President of the Ohio Senate, yeah that's second to the governor. But he's rolling around in his grave out of disappointment for the lone Republican in the family. Oh and by the way, who took the Kennedy class?"  Doc: "EEEEEE! Oh AllEEEEson. Funny girl, but a little slow in chemistry."  Senora Chaves: "Oh Jorge is a girl very especial. She is okay at the espanish, but she lacks in the area of burbaarry and coach etc. She should really espend her money on epointless things asuch as designer clothes, because that is how you get an A in my class. P.S. Everything is just so beautiful!"  Well there you have it. Now I must go study aka watch tv. BYE!
