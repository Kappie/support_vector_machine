Tearing thru boxes of Oreo's with teeth only, no hands  2.) Rubbing Porkchops on my underarms  3.) Orange Juice Slip  4.) Spelling out words on the floor with Squeezable Jelly    I said:  1) Take all the lobsters out of the tank and snip off their bands so they could have "Lobster Fight Club"  2) Set up all the TP and Papertowels at the end of a aisle and go cart surfing into the squishy pile  3) Spray the floor down with pam or butter and slide around ala Risky Business  4) Create sculptures w. squeeze cheese and various assorted things that would stick toghether.  5) Create a giant people sized litterbox with the cat litter 6) Chopped meat sculpture    The Don adds:  1) Set up all the TP in the store and sit atop a giant castle to rule with an Iron 2ply Fist.  2)Take all the bubbleicious in the store and chew it and make the biggest gumwad ever  3) Tampons plus bottled water pluss rubber bands = Darts on the stores front glass dont need rubber bands really jsut a good toss  4)fill garbage can with pudding and then sit in it  5)New Ky with heated action slip and slide  6) chicken or turkey bowling wiht liters of milk set up as pins  7) mop sword fights  8) last is conveyor belt treadmill  Now we turn to you, our jungle friends...what would  you  do given free reign in the supermarket??
