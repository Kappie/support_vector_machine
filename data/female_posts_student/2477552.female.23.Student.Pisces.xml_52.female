To my chagrin each and every person that I passed yesterday had to look at what exactly it was that I was carrying. Even by the clock tower one guy trying to collect donations goes  "Hey. Cool. A terrarium!"  Boy I felt like a huge dork/nerd/nerd. lol. And then he says do you have any money to make a donation. Um no? I'm carrying a 15 lb. glass jar/terrarium, my arms  can't hold it anymore, and no one asks if I need help.   So I continued to walk my way across campus, it only took 20 minutes. Which is great timing when carrying such a bulky item.  I sat it on the desk, took tons of notes on roman civilization and made the guy in my class walk with me to our next class. So that I wouldn't look dumb carrying the damn thing around any more. We walked over the bridge and made it to class. Not once did I drop the glass lid, it did not break into shards.  Nor did one guy ever ask if I needed help or asked if he could carry it. I need to ask  where is the chivalry? Where is the common courtesy? People nowadays are soo ignorant.  Weren't they taught any manners?  Apparently that answer is no.  So I gave my presentation in my gpy 353 class. Got interupted by random incoming students, couldn't show the web page that I had created (because the prof decided that we were going to sit in a circle), and she interrupted me and cut me off. She used up the last two minutes of my presentaion time and then her timer goes off and she goes "thank you Amy that was very good. Now everyone clap for Amy." Ugh. Atleast she wanted to look at my terrarium. I had like tons of awesome creative ideas for a high school geography lesson unit.    And then I got to walk home by myself carrying the extremely heavy glass terrarium. I really do hate ignorant West Michigan people, with a passion.
