Then about 6 me, Tregory, and my brother went to Choctaw Lake for Fireworks Over The Water, which really doesn't start till like 9:30, but they tell you to get there early. So we get there, nothing to do but walk around and eat. Tregory's cousins weren't there so he had to spend all day with me. Lucky Him. Teeheehee. Anyways then about 9:40 the fireworks started. It was very cool especially over the water, and with Tregory 3Cherry3'sTregory3
