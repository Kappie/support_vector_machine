OMG story time. everybody knows i love my fun coffee drinks, so when chris picked my up this morning to hang out and we were sitting at the stop light and i decide to take a sip of my coffee at the exact moment chris decideds he is gonna go! so coffee spills all over me and i freak out! so there is a big coffee stain on my shirt right now, and when we got to ROTC col. and MSgt made fun of me for it!! hehehe any wayz chris and i hung out with jared after we went to ROTC.It was fun we played a bunch of pool. I've improved alot ( i think)! when mom was driving me home from jared's i saw that miree's car was at the pool so i jumped out and went to talk to her and i ended up staying there till like 9:30!!! but it was fun miree and i went to kroger's and sonic!
