Came home via April, then called Chelsea. We talked for a while. I'M HAVING CHELSEA WITHDRAWAL!!!! I MISS HER!!! My mom hasn't let me go over there all week!!! It's so unfair *cries* umm...anywho...We didn't do ANYTHING in ANY of our classes today! It was great. Mrs. Hamlin came into our class to talk to us about setting goals. I've been thinking alot lately about what I want to achieve in life. I'm still not sure what I want to be when I get out into the real world. I was thinking about teaching American Sign Language and/or Spanish. I think that teaching in a deaf school would also be worthwhile. Basically, I want to make an impact on other people's lives.  I want to help others. That's why I do Girl Scouts, though in all honesty it helps me even more, I think. I know that the people who usually read my blogs already know that I want to leave my mark on the world. I suppose I just....I want to be needed......Is that being selfish? I feel so, for lack of a better word, useless. I feel as though I don't do anyone any good whatsoever. And I don't want to feel like that anymore. I suppose this blog has kinda went downhill in the amount of cheerfulness, and I apologize for that. I just have to express these feelings, and this is the only way I'm comfortable doing so. Tommorrow will be more cheerful, I promise....well, I hope it will be more cheerful anyways.
