Jennifer Garner played a good Electra, Michael Clarke Duncan was great as Kingpin (even though, Brian insists that he should have been white, but I counter that you cannot find a white guy actor who will fit the role better than the guy that was chosen -- he was perfect) and I loved Colin Farrell as Bullseye.  As far as Ben Affleck goes, well you know how I feel about him (whiny ass)!  LOL!  He was okay.  The effects were great.  Nice cameos from Stan Lee and Kevin Smith.  Great movie!  Will definitely add it to the to-buy list!
