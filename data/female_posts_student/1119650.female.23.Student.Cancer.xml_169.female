Last night I got phone calls from a few of my old  urlLink high school  friends who are home from spring break.  People I thought I'd completely lost contact with, but everything was just the same as it'd always been.  We've made plans to hang out and go get  urlLink coffee  or check out a movie or maybe even hit up a  urlLink bar .  Hopefully it should be a good time.    There are still some things that aren't sitting right in my life, but I guess that will all have to wait for wednesday when I go to my new  urlLink shrink .  I've also realized that I have an extremely dark side to me.  This might seem unusual as most everyone knows of my affinity for bubbles, afroken and piglet, but this other side scares the crap out of me.  I have very detailed and morbid thoughts, some are extremely violent against myself, some against other people.  Thats not to say I have dreams of killing myself or hurting myself, but in my dreams many people are trying to chase and kill me.  I can feel it if I get shot, punched or stabbed.  They're so real, its scary!  I really don't want to be at work this week, like somehow thats any different than any other week, lol.  I have a bunch of stuff I need to get done, but I'd just love to be napping.  That could be really great.  Maybe I could find someone to build me a bed under my desk like in that Seinfeld episode.  Then I could call in a bomb threat and I could sleep peacefully or sneak out the back door.  Working for a living is silly.  I have to find a billionaire old man to marry like  urlLink Anna Nicole  "Anna, anna, fabulous anna, anna nicole she so outrageous!"  (Yes, I'm the person who keeps watching crap like this so networks will put more of it on, sue me!)
