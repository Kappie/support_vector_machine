Either I end up lookingabsolutely stupid or extremely mad aboutsomething. Luckily this picture just makes it look like I'm mad about something instead of looking stupid---or I could look stupid and mad in this picture.   Oh well, I guess this is a *major* step (lol yeah right) because I've always been afraid of someone I know finding this blog and then knowing 1/4 of everything that I think about daily instead of knowing nothing. Here I am rambling on again... I must shut up and think for a while...      Darn...   I just realized that I look strikingly similar toa deer in the headlights. Ah, life!
