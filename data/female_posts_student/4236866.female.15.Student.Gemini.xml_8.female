This character, to me, seemed more human than others like Spiderman, Batman and stuff like that; I think it was because of Berry's performance, she was really great! Although I wasn't so crazy about the outfit, she could pull it off! I think she could wear a sweatshirt and she would still look hot. In the movie she looked so pretty! Even with the short hair and leather pants, she looked amazing. She stole the entire movie! She even outstood Sharon Stone and that's a lot to say.  Overall thougts, good movie, great performance of Halle and a new perspective of cats...(Even if I'm allergic to them hehe..)  "A girl like me, lands on her feet"
