Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.  --Abraham Lincoln  In short, be wary of power.  There's a reason they say "absolute power corrupts absolutely".  Sorry, just had to wax philosophical for a bit, now that I'm getting an opportunity to work with some of the most important state officials, good and bad ones.  What else...I'm sleep deprived. I wish I could take afternoon naps. I OD'd on caffeine yesterday morning and ended up sick.  Not only can I not hold my liquor anymore, apparently I can't hold my caffeine, either.    Not much else is going on, except the weather is growing worse by the minute. And I have my most boring class of the week tonight-my state government seminar. Ugh. Other than that, things are good.  More later.
