So, yeah.. my life the last few weeks...  Well, for those of  you comletely out of the loop - I'm up in Maine with Daddy this summer.  He's working at the MeadWestvaco plant till October, then he has a couple weeks off, then he goes to Maryland for a few months.  But this isn't his blog, so moving on...  I'm just getting over mono.   (Don't ask me where I got it - I haven't seen Tom since April (and we're not together now, anyways) and if you knew the boys at my school...  *shudders* yeah.. not an option.  But I read that sometimes someone'll have the virus, but never develop the symptoms, so they can still pass it on to someone unknowingly, like by sharing drinks or coughing or something like that... So I imagine that's how I got it.)    It kinda sucks that I got it during the summer, cuz I was basically holed up in the house for an entire month.  Not that I really have a problem with that.  I'm prefectly fine staying home all day doing nothing (as long as I have a computer with internet) but I wanted to hike and do other outdoor stuff this summer since I don't get many opportunities to.  Oh well, I'm better now, and we've been cramming a bunch of stuff into my last month, to make up for lost time, so it's all good.  But if I had to get it, I'd prefer summer instead of during school, cuz that would've seriously sucked.  Ahh, yes, almost forgot about this.  Daddy and I had *quite* an adventure the other day.  I'll just paste what I told Pete about it, so I don't have to type it all up again.  ok.. yesterday afternoon, daddy and i went kayaking... started out as a really nice hot pretty day.  then after we'd been out like 45 minutes... we notice this big gray cloud in the sky... and hear this long, low, rumbling thunder..  so, we start paddling really really fast trying to find a nice level spot on the bank to get out at.  so we do that, and we set under some trees... and it starts sprinkling... and then it starts raining... and then it starts pouring... and then it pours harder... and then it pours even harder... and then we start getting pelted with hail.. really hard.. for like five minutes...... then it stops hailing.. but keeps pouring.. so we're sitting up on the river bank for like an hour and a half, and the rain lets up some, so we get back in our kayaks, and we have to go over to the other side so we can get up by the highway.  and it's much steeper on that side, so we have to struggle just to get up the bank, not to mention dragging the kayaks.  then we have to walk around this big long wheat field.. and we get to the highway.. and we have to walk two miles back to the house... while it's still raining, mind you, so we run in and change clothes, and get in the car and daddy gets out where we left the kayaks and i drive back home.. and he brings a rope and ties the two kayaks together and finishes kayaking to where we initially left the truck... and.. yeah.. i was absolutely freezing.. it was quite an afternoon.. i don't ever wanna get hailed on again... but it was pretty funny     Oh yeah, I kinda sorta halfway got a webdesign job.  Daddy was taking me to the doctor a couple weeks ago, and we had a little time to kill, so we went into this  computer store and daddy told the people that I liked computers and made webpages and we so we started talking about it.  So I made a few layouts and went over there a  couple times to show them what I'd made.  I mean, the stuff was obviously pretty amateur, but it looked pretty decent.  And of course,  the more I make, the better my Photoshop and CSS skills get.  They particularly liked this one I made with a really cool picture Pete took.  (I'll add a link to it when I get it all set up - they gave me a subdomain on their site,  and I'm working on uploading all of them and making the main page that links to all the layouts, but I'm having trouble with transparent  .pngs in  IE...  anyone know javascript...? *hopeful*)  Anyways, they'd obviously only use me for a small project, and those just kinda come as they come, so I won't really get to actually do any work for them most likely, but they said quite a few times that I could set up my own little business starting with like friends and  family, and I could contact them if I needed any help.  And they got my number here and in Florida, so I'm pretty happy with it.  Just hope I can get something actually going...  I think it should work out tho.  Cindy's parents are here this weekend.  They got here yesterday, and they're staying  for a few days then driving to some places around then coming back here for a few more days, then going home.  They all went to Mt. Washington or something in New Hampshire, but I stayed home since I don't feel well.  So it's just me and Sam (Cindy's dog) he's laying in here on the floor and I'm laying on my bed and we're both just being lazy... fun stuff
