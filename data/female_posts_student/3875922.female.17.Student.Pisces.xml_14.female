BUT NO NO NO NO NO  he said i over complicated the whole matter, ok maybe i did... but that doesnt let him say  "Rory warned me 5 days ago that you all ways pass the debts on and confuse it all. And now you have gone and done it. And you have been extremely inconsiderate to me. Rory owes andrew 130 pounds. NOw you have confised the debts which means rory owes me the tenner.Hes hardly going to pay me back straight away when he owes andrew all that money. I wont see my tenner for months and months and i need that cash"   and i love the last bit: "DONT DO IT AGAIN, accept it. you have done the wrong thing"   FOR FUCKS SAKE who the hell does he think he is! yes ok i was wrong, but "dont do it again"???????????????????   pah   i guess the culture and backgrounds we come from are far more different than just that "little bit"   xxk
