Soo for those who haven't heard about Creed's big breakup... alright wasn't so big... here ya have it.. POOF.. there they went. Dear Scott Stapp has been left behind to pursue writing songs for an album devoted to The Passion of the Christ (ooohhh we didn't see that coming!!!) and Scott and Mark have moved along and created.. dun dun dun..  Alter Bridge.. mwah.. its fantastic stuff guys (coming from the die hard Creed fan.. err former.. die hard fan..) They picked Brian back up! and no.. I have no idea who this Myles Kennedy.. is hehe.. but he seems to sound alright.  Listen ta the single and such.. 'Open Your Eyes'... good stuff guys... you may have to listen to it a couple of times.. but -I- fell in love with it..   urlLink  Alter Bridge     I have a lot more I could say... but you people pay way too much attention to this thing... so I won't for now...
