I play my part to be a perfect girlfriend to you but you fucked up big time. All you wanted to do was to keep me in a lock down. I cant change you and you'll never change.   Why the fuck do you care so much where I am at, who I am with, what I am doing? Its none of your business for all that I care is my freedom. Between you and me, its sooo over, its history. You know that the past will always remain the past. Nothing can be changed. Over and over I let you lead the way, but you've lost me because of your insecure and you're too over protected love.  Instead you try to control my life. That isn't how I appreciate how I want to be treated.   Whats yours was once mines, whats mines was once yours, but those days are over. I'm grown now, I don't need you.  I hate you more than anything in the world. Why do you still want to play little kids games? Why cant you see that I don't need you anymore. I'm doing better on my own, no need for your shoulders to cry on. I don't wanna shine when you shine; I've got my own path to walk now. Don't ever think that I will forget what you did to me. I was hurt and I shall remember my wound. Just fucken leave and never come back to me.   I rather walk away then be with a person like you. I don't want to bring tears to my eyes anymore. Never again that I will shed my tears for you. Never again will I talk about you. Never again will I say your name. Leaving you was what I needed to do to be okay. I made that move years ago. I don't need you next to me anymore. Don't talk about future plans with me, don't call me, don’t come back to me with a fat diamond ring. Its not worth it, you’re just wasting your time. Just leave me alone. Go to hell for god's saint.
