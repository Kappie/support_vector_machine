Yes, it's a complicated feeling.  So...hm...we had a band practice on Snow Day...dudes....we totally owned everything within at least a three mile radius, and the ownage tremors could be felt several counties over. Presently, and because another band is called Pariah ( urlLink click here and throw rocks at them! ) already, we've changed our name...to what, is not certain. It could be Daniel Krikorian's Suicide Death Machine, it could be Moose Carcass, it could be Cousin It, and it could be Trapeze Act. We don't really know as of yet. All we do know is: we BRING the  death  to the death metal. Excitement overflows.  Hoo! I'm really wired I believe. Wyler's just put out some green tea with peach flavour and I'm sort of anxious to try it, so I think I'm going to, but before this I was having Purity tea, which is the BEST of the non-flavoured teas, and caffeine+me=REALLY PERSONABLE! But that tends to get old. So...I wish you all the best until next time.
