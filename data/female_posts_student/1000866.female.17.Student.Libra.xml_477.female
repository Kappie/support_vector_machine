Oh my gosh. It wasn't cool. I had the window seat, and obviously she had the aisle. Well, I drank a bunch of water before I left and I have like...the world's smallest bladder so I kept having to get up. But that's not even the bad thing. The bad thing was this lady was like...90 and could barely walk or stand up so I felt reallllly guilty for having to make her get up. Why didn't I just switch seats with her you ask? Well, I tried. I was like, "Would it be easier if we just switched seats?" only to find out that...she doesn't speak a word of English. UGH. It was not cool, not cool AT ALL. I also didn't sleep for the whole eight and a half hours, but it's ok because I'm here now and it's awesome.  We have this apartment here and it's really neat. It has two bedrooms and a kitchen with a microwave, dishwasher, and refrigerator. That's pretty handy. It's also got a TV with like 60 channels. So, we turned on the TV thinking we could find CNN. I mean...you would think...but no, no CNN., So, we look through all the channels hoping to find at least one English channel. Lo and behold, we find one...heh, MTV. Seriously, MTV with Italian captioning. Ugh. No CNN but MTV....it just made me laugh for like, ten minutes straight. I suggested to my dad that maybe we can turn on English captioning and watch one of the Italian news channels so he's trying to fix that right now.   Seriously, I just love it here. I could live here. I'm just kind of online winding down before I go to sleep since we just got home from the pantheon which is BEAUTIFUL at night, and dinner was SO good. I guess I should go sleep now though. Big day tomorrow. Ah, I love it here. :)
