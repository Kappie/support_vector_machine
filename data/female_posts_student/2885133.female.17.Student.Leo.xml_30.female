Of course, that was rebutted when I took a college English course and proved meaningful fluff gave me a very good A for the class. Hmm... Maybe you should lather the generic "it" thick like the Baroque artists.  Meh... 5 hours of sleep and I've been drowsy for the entire day. To think, I was able to handle that during the school year. Oh well, perhaps this had to do with the fact that insomnia is back and I am not used to it. I need to get used to it soon though. I can't always cling on 10 hours of sleep... *wail* I dun wanna grow up!
