Well, apparently they're still there but you have to pull these freaky magic tricks to get them to work, and I'm computer illiterate so I don't know where they are. If you want to try and help, I'd appreciate it. Anyways... today was pretty funny. Heywood is crazy in class and gives us tons of homework. Dodie doesn't give his class anything! Flag football was fun. I wore really manly shorts, and want to wear them the rest of the time, it makes me feel bad ass. I was throwing with Blaire and Sarah Bloom, and I told them how I was convinced that I was a hermaphrodite at birth, they laughed. Blaire said everybody starts out as a boy, do you think that's true? Pryor complained about his razor burn again today. My team won, woo no thanks to me! Pryor made me do the kick off, but I was really scared. It was slippery and bad outside, so I ran towards the ball, completely missed it and fell flat on my face! It was priceless! Then I hit it, but Ann was mean to me and told me I wasn't a threat anymore. FINE! Hartshorne is so aggressive. He completely knocked Blaire straight towards the ground. He was blocking me and I got pissed, so I started to beat him up and then he yelled. Pryor pulled up his shirt one time too, it was gross. Then I was talking to Doden, who crossed the field, and I asked to see inside his satchel, and he starts screaming and yelling, "You want to PEE inside my satchel?!" NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID! We had to discuss honor 7th and 8th, boo boring. Trisha and I were flicking around a piece of paper, and I flicked it and it flew off and hit ZAZU! It was so funny. Well I'm done with this. Bye.
