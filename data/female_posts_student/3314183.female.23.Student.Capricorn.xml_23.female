To pray for you and help you grow. Thats what you've asked of me.  I've opened up my heart, my life to you once again.  Please lie no more. For even if you fool me..you can't fool God.He knows.. And this time, if you decide to leave, I will be sad, no doubt. But I am prepared. I'm so tired of fighting, of struggling with you and with myself.  If it's God's will that you'd leave. You will. No matter how hard I try, how hard I fight. Its all gona be fruitless. Go if you want.  I've hidden in the shadows long enough. I want to be in the sunshine. If all you can offer is late night trading then forget it. I dont want you.  Trust. Such a crucial factor. Yet I've lost all of it in you. How can we possibly have a start this way? When all trust has been lost even before anything has even started. They are all persuading me to leave you. Not to even have you as a fren.  Not to ever bother about what happens to you cos ur jus not worth it.  Cos ur an unstable guy. Not to mention spiritual maturity. Even the basic requirements of trust and stability you can't provide. They are afraid you'd hurt me again. That I'd sway away from God if we ever got together cos ur not really a Christian to many. Your heart isn't with God. But I'm always giving you the benefit of the doubt. That maybe this time ur gona change. Maybe this time ur not lying. Maybe this time ur serious about turning to God.   Disappoint me no more.. will you? Help me to help you. If you don't even want to help yourself, how do you expect me to help you..  Or maybe I'm just not in the position to help.. cos i'm not even ok myself.  Praying..
