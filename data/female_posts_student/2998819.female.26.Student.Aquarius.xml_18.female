We knew we went the right way because we passed them on our way back (out and back). I tried some new things. I wore shorts again, I think I need to find another pair I have been wearing biking shorts and they don't breathe. I had a peanut butter toast for breakfast and it didn't bother me at all. I wore a hat, the hat was the best thing. It kept the sweat from dripping in my eyes and made me feel cooler, if that makes any sense. Lastly I had my water! I learned my lesson from last week. Water saved me this week.    My goal for this run was to make it under and hour and I did with five min. To spare. My partner and I did our 5 miler in 55 min. Not bad for a Saturday long slow distance!    Enjoy your runs this week.
