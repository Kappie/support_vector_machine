Liz got home tonite and i called her and we talked for like an hour and tomorrow we're hanging out and might spend the nite at one of our houses. yays!  Today i went for my surgery Pre-op. funnnn stuff.  I first went to the dr and talked to the PA a little bit who turns out to be my neighbor, and he explained the procedure and all that good stuff. Next stop was the hosptial, i registered in and got my wrist band printed up and ready for me monday morning. Then i went to see the pre-op nurse and she asked me a bunch of ?s and took my blood pressure...gawd it was sky high, im soo stressed out over this. so we laughed about it. Then i went to talk to the dr who is gonna put me to sleep and she was soo nice, i wish she was like my everyday dr. well, she started talking about the IVs and meds and stuff and i went into panic attack mode, i tried so hard to control it, but i started shaking and my blood ran cold and soon shes asking me if im ok and changing the subject...But im told they actually numb ur hand with a "tiny needle" before the IV. great..more needles. I did mangage to hold in my tears until i got in the car and then some came out then they all came out at my grandmas house when she said "gosh julia, u can control that" ..no i cant. Panic attacks cant be controlled or people wouldnt have them!! the drs are well aware of my issues and they were really understanding and will make sure im comfy. I then went and got my meds so i'll have them for monday, i got like a huge bottle of pain killers and a bottle of Perkaset (sp?). good narcotic stuff. lol oh and i also get a morphine pump. stylin there.  I have decided to get my nose pirced..i REALLY want it done. :p yays Anyone wanna watch? im already gonna take kaela and liz. lol pop some pills and go get it done!! :D  Thats basically been my day...I'll update you prob tomorrow..or sunday...but it might be a while next week cuz i'll be in bed and stuff.  *much love and red roses*
