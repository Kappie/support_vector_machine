I don't remember girls doping up, shoplifting and having sex with high school guys (okay, perhaps one of the three, but not all in combination).  Maybe it's because I grew up in rural Kentucky.  But wow, it makes the thought of having kids really scary.  I mean, what's the world going to be like in 15-20 years when my kids are 13?  I shutter to imagine.    So I have become that which I hate.  An email slacker.  But when nothing is going on in your life, what can you do?  I mean, I get up, go to class/the museum, study for prelims all day, and then get on IM and/or talk to Matt on the phone at night.  No big news there.  I guess I should be less harsh with others who are slow with their replies.  Quote of the day: "Things have a life of their own.  It's simply a matter of waking up their souls..."  -Melaquides, from One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
