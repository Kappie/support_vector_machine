I think that my skin is probably still recovering from the lake water or I got a little wind burned today... hmmm.  I don't think I'm going to write anymore about Senior Skip day, since I already did at my blog.  The community blog is for community things.  You know, like SARS.  So at the moment, I'm smelling my hair.  Yes, it sounds wierd, but it perplexes me.  I used a new conditioner for the first time today, and so my hair smells differently than it normally does, which is kinda wierd.  I'm used to having the same old smell circling around my head, this new foriegn smell will take some getting used to.  *sniff* Oh well, at least it's clean, right?  I can't believe I don't have any homework.  Hell, I can't believe I'm done with school.  This is so surreal.  That's my catch phrase for the whole graduation experience.  I'm extremely prepared to leave this town and it's football jocks behind, but I've been ready for this day since about 8th grade... and now that it's finally here... I don't really understand.  The clicky things in my head just aren't clicking the way they should be clicking.  I'm never going to see a lot of these kids again... *devilish grin*  I'm literally waiting by the phone now.  Well, it's just coincidence that the phone is sitting exactly 1.5 inches away from the computer desk, but I am awaiting a phone call from monsier Giles.  *dramatic reverb*  You don't know nothin', Manda
