They indulge in some toilet and bidet humor, apparently. According to the  urlLink Washington Post's Leslie Walker , when  urlLink Toto  presented their high-tech toilet, the crowd, which included Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, and Steve Jobs, erupted into giggles.  I don't see what's so funny about it. The  urlLink Neorest  is a must-have for any ultra-hygienic OCD case. The Neorest's features include a seat warmer, a sensor that opens the seat as you approach, auto cleaning for both the toilet and the user, and the  urlLink Cyclone Flush . There are so many features, it comes with an lcd-equipped wireless remote so you can control them all.  I'm hoping that Toto comes up with a porta-potty version for outdoor concert venues.   Watch the   urlLink Cyclone Flush in action .
