I'm in running shorts and an old t-shirt and I don't know what else to do. Am full from lunch. Probably will make more notecards and listen to music.   But it's almost like you keep things down on purpose because you've had something so good and you just tread lightly so you don't disturb that kind of peace. I don't want to clean up my room. I just want to leave everything the way it is. For now, at least. I'm sure after spring break I'll start working upstairs again, but I need the media room now. I wonder where all my study materials went after last night.  It's Austin's birthday today, but he doesn't seem to be having all that much fun. It appears that it's just another spring break morning spent at the computer. It's almost tragic: his away message is something about a "somber birthday." I don't remember turning 14. (thoughtful pause) Yes I do. It wasn't all that great. I just wish I could sneak him out somewhere and make him happy? but he's having dinner with friends on...Saturday.  Things to do, maybe, on Saturday. Hah, I just remembered. Colburn. Earth Day activities.   I need to delete AIM, I really, really do. Or maybe I'll keep it on and just delete it when it really matters. or just stay invisible for a very very long time. I don't know what to make of it: I know it's not as good as a face-to-face conversation and usually you go on to make small talk and pretend you're doing something amusing. And sometimes you stay up until 5:30 talking to people. Ahem.
