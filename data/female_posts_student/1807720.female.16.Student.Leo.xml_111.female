I am really hoping that my average will go up before the final because it would really help me alot.  Besides I worked hard enough that I really know that I deserve my average to go up.  I am so glad finals will be over soon.  I just want to get them over with, the thought stresses me out but I am going to put EVERYTHING into studying for Chem.  And well actually I already started studying for Chem and did some math review but I am not going to worry too much about math until after I am done with the Chem and Social finals.  After school ended, Sarah, Me, Chels, Mat, Alex, and Lenny all went to Swiss Chalet for lunch and we got soup with chicken and fries, and then pie afterwards.  It was soooo good.  I think starting tommorow though I am going to try eating healthy again, if I could loose 40 pounds once, then the last 20 I want to loose I think is definetly possible.  So yeah - Eat healthy tommorow Vanessa!  Oh and I confess.  I like the Chem teacher.  I know I always complain about chem, and at the beginning of the year I really didn't like the way she teaches.  But you know what, I really think she is really nice and actually really cool.  Although sometimes hard to understand, I really feel like after that day we had a "talk" she has put alot of effort into trying to help me understand and after "talk" I haven't heard her say anything rude to me or anything that would make me feel bad.  She is like different from ANY other teacher that I have EVER had, and I think she has the most coolest and most diverse wardrobe on the face of the planet cause her style is outta this world.  I would kill to like dress like her - I think her fashion style is really cool.  And she owns like 20 million types of high heel shoes.  Especially the ones she wore today when you could see skin, they were classy and I sooooo wanted them. But Mrs. J will always be my most favourite teacher in the entire world and will ALWAYS be number 1 on the list of my favourite teachers, but the chem teacher comes in second place, which in my books is extremely high.
