[SECRET]Hair dye![/SECRET] -Goddess Din  Yesterday my mom felt a very strong abdominal pain at around 11.30 PM. She said that it hurt really bad so we decided to go to the Methodist Hospital of Dallas. My aunts and I went with her, and my dad and brother stayed home. As we were driving to the hospital, I could see that she was about to cry, but I didn't look, 'cause I hate it when people cry.Ijust feel terrible, and I'm sure other people feel that way when they see one of their family members cry. The good thing was that my aunts kept making her laugh and stuff. We arrived at the hospital's emergency roomat like 11.45.  We had to sign in and stuff. I hate hospitals, they're such sad places to be in. All those sick people and all. It was so fuggin' cold in there, but I was feeling warm, surprisingly. They called us twice to put my mom's data and all that crap, and we had to pay quite a few dollars just to check. My mom didn't have the money that they were asking for, so she just gave the lady the money she had. Then we went back outside. I think it's really stupid that they ask you your data and all that crap when you're just dying of pain. Isn't it called  emergency room ? I mean, my mom was really suffering from the pain, but it was quite a few hours before they called her in to check her. Fug that. I know that they attend the other people who are worst thanyou, butheck, if you don't crywhen yougo in that emergency roomthen you have to wait. Bull.    Since it was extremely cold in that place, it was making my mom feel worst. I was getting soft so I asked the lady if they had a blanket. They didn't. So I called my dad to bring a blanket for my mom. I waited outside for my dad and whileI was waiting a made a little conversation with a doctor that was outside. Nice. About five or ten minutes later my dad arrived with the blanket. He gave it to me then he left. I came back in and I noticed that they still hadn't called my mom. Blasted morons. My aunts still were inside and kept making jokes and laughing, but then my mom told them to be quiet since they were the only loud ones. Then thirty minutes later my aunts couldn't stand being silenced so they went to grab some coffee then went to the car to "sleep," but they were just talking and laughing. I sat next to my mom to warm her feet since they were really cold. Know what's stupid? She was feeling better already. See, this is what I'm talking about. A few hours ago my mom was dying from the pain, and they were asking her questions when she was feeling really bad. Fuggers. Now that she had gone through the pain and a bunch of stupid moronic questions, she feels better without the help of any doctor. Ugh. I mean, there was this lady that just by seeing her face you could see her agony and that she had a really bad abdominal pain, but they took a really long time before they called her in. Once they called her she was feeling better (w00t for eavasdroping). _ _;;    At around 2 AM they called my mom, and she didn't have the abdominal pain anymore. They took us to this room and a few minutes later this nurse came in to ask her more questions, then she left 'cause they were gonna get a doctor or something. It was even more cold in that room, so thank goddess that we brought a blanket with us. My mom was lying in this bed with the blanket while I was sitting in a chair. She kept asking me if I was cold but I told her I wasn't. A while later this doctor came and didn't ask that many questions about the pain, but he told my mom that she was going to have to take stronger medication because the one she was taking wasn't helping. He said he was going to write a prescription so we had to wait in the room until he was back. A couple of minutes later my mom noticed I was cold so she made me sit next to her with the blanket. Forty-five minutes passed and the darn doctor still didn't come with the prescription. My mom was getting desperate and kept sneezing, 'cause you can't imagine how fuggin' cold it was in there. So I kept roaming the halls to see if I could find the doctor that had attended us, but since I didn't see him I decided to ask the nurse who had come inside before. She told me we had to wait for it to be written, and that's all she said. Err.    It was almost 3 AM and still no prescription. I went outside again and found the doctor I had talked to before while I was outside (he called me Ms. Spongebob 'cause I was wearing my Spongebob PJs). He asked me if I needed anything and I told him about the prescription and all. He told me that it was already written, so they were gonna take it to my mom's room in just a few minutes. The nurse came and explained everything, then we went back to the car. The whole ride back was just a whole bunch of laughter, but I couldn't laugh because every time I did my stomach would hurt. Once we got home and we were going to the apartment we couldn't walk because one of my aunts was just making us laugh so bad. We had to sit down for a while. Holy crap, it seemed as if though we were drunk! Hilarious stuff. I didn't go to sleep until 6 AM and woke up until 3.45 PM. Great night. Since this was yet another long entry, I'll write about the quarter finals of soccer tomorrow, even though no one cares except me. =P Hehe, 'tis all.
