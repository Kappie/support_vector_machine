No, i'm not tt rich to fly SIA...anyway, amos snatched the window seat as usual [big baby] and i ended up craning my neck to see wat was outside. U know, i dun get to sit on planes often. By the time we reached the Kota Kinabalu [KK] Airport in Sabah, it was already 8pm. Blame it on the stupid transit at Brunei...2 hrs 50 mins waiting...thank goodness i brought Angels  Demons along. Anyway, we reached the KK National Park at 10 plus, then quickly checked in to the moth-ridden, forsaken hostel tt we had to share with 6 other peeps. YuX. Moths just gimme the creeps. But i surprisingly slept fairly well tt night...at 12 midnight though.   #Day 2   Ok, now at 8:15am, we started our super-long journey up Mt. Kinabalu. The trail is 8.72km long, and for today, we were supposed to finish 6km of it to reach the rest house, Laban Rata. It was an enjoyable climb, cos i didn't carry anything...haha...and also the air was very cool [but dry and lacked oxygen]...then u see weird caterpillars wif red caps on their heads and funny-looking plants. Anyway, the journey seemed to drag longer and longer and me and my bro were starting to wish tt Josh had followed us :( But we finally reached Laban Rata at 1:15pm...a whole 5hr climb! It was cold up there, i tell u. Dunno how many thousand feet. Air was very thin too...caused me to haf fever and headache. *bleh* We then checked in to our rooms, bathed wif hot water [tt was shiok] and then slacked the whole day, cos a helluva time awaited us the next day...   #Day 3   Woke up at 1 plus am to start to climb to the summit...DAMN COLD!!! Last night was like 9 degrees already and now even colder. Armed wif a few layers of clothes and about 4 litres of water, we started our climb to the summit at 2am. It seemed easy at first, but i was light-headed and all from the fever even after a panadol...then after the easy part came the rope part. It was all rocky...no soil at all to step on, so we had to cling on to ropes...in the dark!! We had no idea how steep it was till the return journey. It was pitch-dark, and we were only armed wif torches, which some of them conked out along the way. Sigh...the unreliability of technology. Anyway, the climb started to get more and more monotonous and tiring...cos it was getting colder and colder...everyone's hands were numb...feet aching...aiyoh, in other words it was torture. The summit seemed to be sooooooo far away...but finally, when the horizon showed signs of orange, we had finally reached the summit, in time for the sunrise. But poor me, so freezing cold tt i didn't bother to stand up to see it, juz hid behind a rock to block of the wind. Ok...then when the sun was up, it was time to come down. Then we realised how steep everything was. What can I say? It was REALLY steep. At one part, i wondered how i managed to conquer tt steepness in the dark...i tot i was sleep walking. LoL. Anyway, we took a scenic walk down to Laban Rata, where we rested there for awhile...cos stupid me got fever and a severe migrane. Then, 1 1/2 hrs later, we set off...this time, all the way down. I tell u, our knees and toes and feet were aching so bad at the foot of the mountain. But we were glad cos we had conquered the tallest mountain in SE Asia! Yay... But then, we still had to stay at the moth-ridden place...yuX...i literally had to close my eyes to bathe...but we were so exhausted we all slept early and well.   #Day 4   Woke up this morning and couldn't get outta bed!! All our legs were SO pain and aching...i nearly collasped when i stood up. But today was the day to rest at Shangri-La hotel in KK town!! Finally a sign of civilization. Our van drove us all the way to Shangri-La and 2 1/2 hrs later, we were enjoying the luxury of the hotel...well, not that it was 5-star or anything, but basically anything is better than that moth-ridden place in the national park. After resting some more, we went shopping...wa...got lotsa shops and clothes leh...delicious food too.   #Day 5  Today, we went to explore the flawless beaches of Pulau Sapi, one of the 5 islands off the coast of Sabah...haha...quoted tt from a tourist pamphlet...anyway, we spent the whole day there...the sand was so white, and the colourful fishes [stupid too] swam right up to shore...they were so close to us...some even banged into ur goggles. My bro used a "magic coral" to attract them...tot it was food...so dumb...haha. We were all burnt tt day. Abe looked like roasted kampong chicken. LoL. At 4 plus pm, we took a boat back to the town.   #Day 6  Today was beach day again...this time, we took a pubilc bus no.16A to Tanjung Aru Beach...a flawless beach too...but no fish...i used my sarong to cover my sunburns cos so pain...haha..then built sandcastle...after that, the clouds grew so dark and from a distance, it looked as if a typhoon was forming...like Day After Tomorrow like tt...so scary. We quickly packed all our things and cao man...the wind blew the sand up until in swirled into our eyes...damn pain but we managed to make it to shade when it finally poured. Scariest storm i have ever seen. After the storm cleared, we took the bus back to our hotel [no more Shangri-La, by the way] then wash up. Then At night went shopping and spent $300++ RM worth on clothes...haha...then went to eat famous char kueh tiao and went home contented wif new clothes. But then, we had to squeeze into 2 single beds throughout the whole night and stupid amos push me off the bed to the floor. Argh.   #Day 7   We went back to the countryside via express bus and i tell u, in the bus, i had the rockiest toilet-going experience of my life. Nearly fell into the toilet bowl. Ok...with grose things aside, we then headed for Poring, where the hot springs were. The hot springs were not wat i imagined them to be...cos they actually already channelled the sulphur [and burning hot] water through pipes into individual pools. I tot it was jus a rock pool where u juz jump inside and get wet and burnt too. The water was soooooo hot! I was like going "ooh" and "aah" and jumping up and down like a xiao lang...but after tt, u get used to it.  We spent a night there at a 2-storey chalet...shiok right? It was a nice place to stay in. But the next day, we had to leave. Oh yeah...i forgot...we also went to the canopy tree-top walk...quite high lar, but the distance so short one. My little bro freaked out...but he made it to the other side anyhow.   #Day 8  This was another day of rest...we went back to the town again and sleep i think...forgot wat i did...haha..maybe shopping? i dunno.   #Day 9  Anyway, as our trip approached the second-last day, we went to stay at another island again, called Pulau Manukan. This island damn nice man...beaches so clean, water so clear, fishes so big and greedy...haha...when we went snorkelling, we saw all kinds of stuff too, including starfish, blue ones...so cute...too bad we didn't have underwater camera. TT day, we stayed one night at another 2-storey chalet made of wood...it was on top of a hill and facing the sea...downright beautiful. U hear the sea from every angle of the house. Sigh...i miss it now :(   #Day 10   Ok last day now...time to go home...sigh...the boat ride back was miserable...cos Manukan is such a nice and laid-back isalnd. After reaching town, we met up wif my mum's long-lost fren for lunch and went to her house. Sayang-ed her 4 dogs for the whole afternoon b4 heading to the airport. Enjoyed the fllight back cos the food was nicer and i got the window seat!! Hahaha. By the time we reached Singapore, it was 10 plus pm already...then we all so shack, reach home only, never bathe go and sleep already...haha  Oh...how i miss Sabah...so fun...so memorable :) Now i all sunburnt and peeling...HeeHee
