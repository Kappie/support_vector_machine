Hello, did you get the memo that this is America and in America we speak ENGLISH!  What's our national language again: oh yeah, thats right....ENGLISH!  Maybe they didn't tell you that when you jumped the border or your raft washed ashore, but here in America we speak English, not Spanish when getting a public service or while out dealing with the public.  I wouldn't go to Mexico, Guatemala, Columbia or wherever else you migth be from and be ballsy enough to  expect  the person I'm speaking to to speak english with me when clearly its not the national language.  I don't care if you English is barely comprehensible, at least you're TRYING to speak the language, and with practice it will get better, but this is not your country, and you left said country for a reason so get used to how it is here....Rar!  **Yes, I am really this insensitive...**  Also I want to welcome  urlLink Gary  to the blogging community (his link is also in the sidebar) and he buys me kick ass birthday presents!  Also I'm really getting into  urlLink Blu's  blog.  I've seen her comment's on Boz's site forever and just never got around to reading it, but I'm loving it (so she's in the linkbar now too!).
