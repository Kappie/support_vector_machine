I hate "constructive critisism"... especially when it comes from someone who knows less than me!  -starts grinding teeth- Honestly... it just pisses me right off.  Anyhoo... well I'm peeving, I have decided that my most hated movie line of all time is "You had me at Hello."  That little piece of sap comes courtousy of Renee Zellewager in  Jerry Maguier .  I don't know what it is, but I cannot stand that line.  Maybe it's the context of the story, or maybe it's just the movie... (Come on-- "Show me the money??"  wth were they smoking when they came up with that bit of pop culture?)  And me and Amy are watching The 6th Sense on Friday, because in a moment of sheer and utter wisdom, I decided that I haden't been scared in a long time and that it was about time.  I was thinking about what movie scared me the most, and this is what I came up with.  I'm concerned.  I hate the movie.  It scares me so bad, but it's a good movie, sooooo.  And I'm watching it with only Amy... yea, some comfort there with her not being scared of that movie and all.  :p  I'm screwd.
