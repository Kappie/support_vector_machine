To staying up late at night...taking a shower...;)Though it seems to get harder each time to say goodbye. I seriously have not stopped crying since he left. I stopped for a bit, until I came home and smelled my Gir doll :( But at least my parents are going to let me go up there for a week or so by any means possible. So that's always nice to think about. And they said he could stay with us anytime, at Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc. I'm glad they like him so much, I knew they would, what's not to like? :) Right before he left I gave him my class ring to show him how much he means to me. The sentimental value it worth so much more...Well I wish I could just type out everything detail, but right now I'm just sad and tired. I'll post more later. I love my Davey :)   And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby
