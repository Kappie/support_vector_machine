Last night i went to see 'I have 5 daughters', a take off of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice'. First of all i arrived at the play 10 min late, no surprise there really. (i was with dad). To make things worse when we got into the hall (all the lights off) dad took me down the middle of the isle only to find seats that were marked 'reserved'. Everyone was staring at us. I went to the back to sit in the seats i saw earlier, dad followed. I didnt understand much, at all really. We couldn't hear anything. We were right in front of the teachers, and when my dad dropped his phone on the ground with this echoing bang, Mrs Douglas gave dad the biggest greasy. Stuff her. I focused my attention to lipsinking again as my dad put his head in his hands. I bent over him and whispered "...only 3 more hours...". Excellent. The second half was not as bad. I decided to ditch dad and sit with Morto and Han. Dad didnt mind though, infact he insisted. I could actually hear from there. Although the play dragged on for too long...Today i did my review on it, the review itself is boring, but bloody brilliant coloured paper.  Cya 4 now, CM
