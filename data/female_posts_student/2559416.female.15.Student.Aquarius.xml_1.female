(as if he was real jajaja)   gives people is just shit...At least for me it is...If anyone could ever want it..Hey its yours...Its not like I'm gonna use it in anything better...I feel as if I didn't need it...As if there was no use in having to live...Living was just meaningless...I was..And am, gonna die anyways...So why not just do it now?.....Why live anything more?.Some say life toughens you by experience...Bad experience...But I don't want to get any tougher...No more experiences...No more suffering....No more life...Please I beg you...Take this away from me....Take my life where I cant ever find it again..Take it somewhere else...Hide it....Disappear it....Make it fade away...Put it in a box...Lock it away...Lock everything I once had away...Feelings..Memories...Thoughts....Wishes...Dreams...Take it all away...I don't want it in me anymore...I just want emptiness...I want to feel nothing..At all...Just to be empty inside...So that I don't have to go through anything that could harm me...Ever again...Just to be hole...Empty.....Useless....
