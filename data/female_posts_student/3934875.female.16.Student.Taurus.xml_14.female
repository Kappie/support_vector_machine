Didnt update lately cos my bloody brother had to conquer back this computer and i cant use it while he's around. Argh~ Nvm.. My weekend..Has been very relaxing. Slept alot. On Saturday,had PFT in the morning. Woke up at 7 and by 9.30 was back home. Washed up.. and went straight to bed. Woke up again at 3. Went back to sleep at 10. Wow. M.R.T. aka Makan,Rest,Tidur.      Didnt do anything today.Woke up at 9.30 and went back to sleep after having breakfast. Hehehe. I didnt even bothered to wash up. Woke up again at 2. Boring day. Watched Spiderman and Shrek 2 today. I love Puss in Boots!! So cute!! =)      Friday nite... Khairul smsed me. And I didnt even bother to reply. What a waste of time. To hell with him. And other guys. Most guys i mean. To hell with u.      Rite now, im desperately looking for songs. Seems so difficult to d/l nowadays. The servers are often down. Oh btw.. My mum asked who was amirhadi when she saw my album on Friday. Just told her it was some guy I like. And she just kept quiet and then suddenly stared at the picture and asked " asal dekat2 nah?" Hahaha.. I just laughed. So did she.. Guess she's understanding.       Well... that was my weekend. Very boring. This coming Friday,Im sleeping over at Nyai's place cos on Saturday evening,we're having a kenduri for Allahyarham Yayi. I had a dream the other nite abt him. Cant remember everything but certain details are for me and for me. Im keeping my sweet dreams to myself. But it'll be good if i get to dream abt Yayi almost every nite. Goodness,I've been saying that all the time. Im so sorry.       Ok..So now, I have to excuse myself. I don't know what homework I have actually. Quite clueless. God.. Well,thats it then. I'll update tomorrow or whatever ok.. See ya arnd! *Loving You Yayi Dearest*    ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~
