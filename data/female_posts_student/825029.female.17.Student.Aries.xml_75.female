(*winks at sb*)  pet peeve #1- homework in BCIS ... what the heck is that about?!?!?! i have to fill out a stupid paper about my "interests and skills" and find a job in the technology/business field that fits me... boooorrriiingggg- any ideas??  pet peeve #2- homework in challenge... that is absolutely unheard of.  i am thoroughly disgusted at the mere thought of it.  i cannot believe that i am being forced to complete a "Maycomb Map" for TKAM.  who cares where scout lives in relation to the post office?!?!  good grief.  well im outta here... 10 bucks blog freezes up as soon as i post this and i have to rewrite it.. oh welllll. goodbye all!
