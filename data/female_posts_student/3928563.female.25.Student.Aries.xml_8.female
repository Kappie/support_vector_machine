I think I need to get tested, but I'm nervous about going to the doctor. What do they do? What do i get tested for? How do I find a good place?   -------------------------------------------------------    Getting tested  for sexually transmitted infections is a bit scary at first, but you gotta do what you gotta do. It's important to be informed about your visit and know what tests to ask for, because you can't assume your doctor is actually giving you the full meal deal every time you go see her. In this case (and every case, as far as I'm concerned) knowledge about your bod is power over your health.  Some symptoms should definitely send you running for tests. These include: blood in your juices or urine, pain during urination or sex, soresblistersrasheswarts or other "growths" on your genitals, abnormal or stinky discharge from your genitals or anus, and tenderness, swelling, or itching of your genitals or anus. That said, MANY STIs, including HIV, are symptomless for a long time after they start doing major damage to your body.  To get an STI check up, make a doctor's appointment somewhere you feel halfway comfortable. Many Canadian hospitals have STI clinics. Most urban areas in Canada have sexual health doctor's clinic, like Planned Parenthood. If that doesn't work, any old doc should be able to give you the tests, as long as you halfway trust them not to give you any shitty attitude. In Canada, the doctor's visit is FREE and the tests are FREE.   The appointment will likely include a sexual history, an external examination to check for syphilis, herpes, or warts, then swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhea, and blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis. Then you'll need a follow-up to get your results. Need more detail?   When you get to the appointment, the doc or nurse will ask you about your  sexual history  (including number and gender of sex partners and activities you've engaged in). This is to determine your level of risk for different types of infection.  Then comes the  physical exam . This is the part where you get naked, put on a paper getup, and spread your legs. The doc should check the outside of your genitals for any suspicious sores, blisters, or warts from  herpes, syphilis  or  human papilloma virus . Doctors can't read minds, so you have to tell them to check out your mouth and throat if you've had high risk oral sex (if you didn't have vaginal or anal intercourse with those people), or to have a look at your anal area if you're a back-door kinda person.   About the  herpes virus  and  human papilloma virus : these are both incredibly common. More than 50% of the population has been exposed to either Herpes type 1 (causes cold sores) or 2 (causes recurrent genital blisters) or both. Probably about 75% of the population has been exposed to human papilloma virus, different strains of which cause warts on different parts of your body (including your genitals and anus). Some strains of HPV have been linked to cervical cancer in young women.   You usually need to see the doctor DURING AN OUTBREAK of herpes or warts for a 100% correct diagnosis. If you are seeing strange blisters, sores, pimples, or soft, cauliflower-like things on your genitals, and have not yet been diagnosed, you need to call the clinic ASAP. Say something like, "I think I might have herpes and I'm having an outbreak right now. Do you have any emergency appointments available in the next couple of days so I can get diagnosed? If not, do you know where I CAN go?" Do not wait for the infection to go away, because these things have a way of popping back into your life.    On to the rest of the physical. If you're a gal, the doc will then do a couple of more things; first, she'll use a speculum, which looks and opens kind of like a duck beak, to have a peek at your cervix. That's a little protrusion tucked up at the end of your vagina. While she's poking around in there, she'll take some swabs (with special Q-tips) from your cervix to look for  chlamydia  and  gonorrhea.  These are sent to an outside laboratory to be analyzed, so don't expect a diagnosis on the spot. The doc might also do a pap smear, which is basically another couple of swabs. If you are sexually active,  you should have a pap smear every year  to check for the beginning stages of  cervical cancer . See the notes for gals below for more on getting your pap smear done.   The doctor will probably also put a finger or two inside your vagina and palpitate your abdomen at the same time. That's to look for swelling and pain that could be pretty serious symptoms of something gone wrong in your reproductive system.  If you're a guy, you are spared the speculum, but you DO have to get tested for  chlamydia  and  gonorrhea . In some clinics, this test is done by swabbing a thin Q-tip a little bit into your urethra. In other clinics, the test is done by peeing into a cup. The doctor will send your swabs or urine to an outside laboratory to be analyzed. It'll take a week or two.   Ok guys, I know which test you'd PREFER, but I hear the swab really isn't that bad. It's momentary discomfort, not agonizing pain. And really, did you SEE what girls have to go through? I think guys who refuse to get tested because they don't like the swab are inconsiderate assholes who don't give a shit about exposing their partners to infection.    About  chlamydia  and  gonorrhea : these are both REALLY contagious bacterial infections. Thankfully, they are both curable with antibiotics. Guys, if you do have symptoms (technicolour penis pus and feeling like you're peeing shards of glass) you'l know it. But, 50% of guys with chlamydia and 10% with gono WON'T have symptoms. Not only that, the vast majority (75-80%) of infected women won't have symptoms either. This is especially troubling because chlamydia and gono can cause serious health problems, including infertility, in women who don't even know they have the disease.      On to the  blood tests , which are the same for girls and boys. The doctor likely won't take your blood right then and there. Instead, she'll give you a piece of paper (a requisition) to take to a special laboratory techician who's trained to take blood. They don't take much (less than a tablespoon of blood) and it's 100% safe. In Canada, you can usually pay to get your blood taken at a private clinic or you can go to the hospital and get it taken for free. The blood lab sends the results back to your doctor in anywhere from a week to a month.   Many clinics routinely do blood tests for three sexually transmitted infections:  Hepatitis B ,  HIV , and  Syphilis . In many urban areas, you can find anonymous testing for HIV and sometimes even Hepatitis B. Ask your local sexual health clinic (like  urlLink Planned Parenthood ) about it.   About  Hepatitis B, HIV, and Syphilis:   Hep B  is a virus that seriously fucks with your liver. It's 10 times more contagious than HIV, but less likely to be fatal. There's no cure, but most people recover from the virus--although some go on to be carriers, able to transmit to others without having symptoms themselves. There is a series of vaccines for Hep B (often free to IV drug users and men who have sex with men). Most young people in Canada were vaccinated in school, but I highly recommend buying the vaccines if you weren't.    HIV  is a virus that attacks your immune system and eventually causes AIDS. It's an incurable and hard-to-treat infection that used to be an automatic death sentence. New treatment regimens are allowing people with the virus to live longer in good health. But there's still no cure, no vaccine, and taking a bazillion heavy duty pills a day just isn't fun. Always use a condom, right?  Warning:  It takes about 3 months for HIV to show up on a blood test. So if your boyfriend only started cheating recently, you might have to wait three months to get an accurate result on your test.   Syphilis  is a relatively rare, but contagious and NASTY bacterial infection that is on the rise in Canada. Remember how people used to go crazy and die from "venereal disease?" That was syphilis. One of the first symptoms is a painless sore or ulcer(chancre) in the place you contracted the disease.   Finally, you have to make a  follow-up visit  with your doc to get the results of all your tests. They MIGHT call you beforehand if you have an infection, but are you really going to trust those overworked clinic staff to pay attention to your result? Plus, they will NEVER give HIV results over the phone. So you have to come back. Do come back. It's for your health and safety.    Do get tested on a regular basis if you've been sexually active. It's the decent thing to do for yourself and for your future partners. Getting an STI is never fun, but there ain't no shame in getting one, either! Lots of people have them, seriously! Normal people, people you work with, go to school with, and who officiate at your church. Most STIs are either curable or controllable, so don't let shame or fear hold you back from making that appointment.   Special note for  guys : don't pee for, say, two hours before your appointment. That's because pee is a nice way to temporarily wash bacteria out of your urethra, which can hide the fact that you're infected with the chlamydia or gonorrhea bacteria.   Special note for  gals : If you are planning on having your annual pap smear done when you get tested, plan the appointment for midway in your cycle, or two weeks after your last period. Don't douche or use vaginal medications 3-4 days before your pap smear. (But just don't douche at all. It's bad for you.)   Also, ladies, if you are sexually active, it's  very important  for you to get checked out regularly. Here's why:    Women are more likely to infected by men during vaginal intercourse--especially unprotected--than men are to get infected by women. One reason? He's spurting liquid out, away from his body, whereas you're taking liquid in and wallowing in it for a few days.  STIs often have more serious health consequences for women because our important reproductive organs are a lot closer to our vagina, anatomywise, than his are to the end of his penis.   STI symptoms are often more subtle, nonexistent, or harder to notice in women. So we can go for a LOT longer before realizing something is wrong.   If you'd like to more about STIs, check out the  Planned Parenthood  website. They've got lots of good info:  urlLink http://www.plannedparenthood.org/sti/ .  Ciao!
