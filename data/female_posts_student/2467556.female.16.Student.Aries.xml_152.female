I rode the Titan for the first time ever and it was sooo intense!  i was sooo scared because it was so frickin high....i went into hysterics halfway through the ride and grabbed onto Barney/Daniel's (britty's cousin) arm and wouldn't let go.  he was like "aah let go!" and i was like "aah i can't!!!".  lol.  Thanks again britty for taking me!!!  Then afterwards, we swam in Britty's pool and played pool basketball.  I guess i took on the role of defense subconsciously because i was rushing after the ball and fighting Barney for it.  In fact, he did a few flips while i was holding onto him trying to get the ball.  Totally intense.  Of course, our team of 3 totally beat Barney's one man team down.  Then we had a war for this raft float thing.  I took Barney down 3 or 4 times using my body weight and Britty and Jess also took him down quite a few times!!!  Of course, we won the raft and Barney wouldn't admit that we won the raft or basketball...psh such a guy lol.  Jess had to leave early and i chilled at Britty's house for a few hours either watching her make signs for our wicked awesome Tampa Bay Cup Finals party or watching Degrassi with Barney.  Her signs for the party are sooooo awesome!!!  And she's going to try and get balloons and streamers etc etc!!!  Its going to be tight.  I still can hardly believe that we pulled a Game 7.....Martin St. Louis is a god.    Tomorrow....our fair hockey season ends and the stupid NHL politics take over, possibly deciding whether our 04-05 season will happen or not.....please pray that we get a season and that Tampa Bay will win the Cup.   Oh yeah! and David Ciminelli is coming back to play for our 04-05 Coppell Cowboys!!!  yaaay!  alright i gotta go....i'm soo freaking tired!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
