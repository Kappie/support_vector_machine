Her name is Naoko, she is 17, she lives in Saitama Ken, Japan and she likes art, like me! ^^  one question: what the fuck is mutton (type on food)? ....nevermind. Okay, I feel stupid.. my sister just informed (with a lot of "DER's" might I add) me that it is sheep.. =_=;  Joelle: What the fuck is mutton? Akira: ER.. it's sheep! DER der der der derp!! hahaha. *snort* Joelle: *thwack*   Yeah anyway, she look like Gogo from "Kill Bill"  (the exchange student I mean).
