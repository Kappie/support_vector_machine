(you know, like the ashes...their always black...so yeah)  rite now im in computer apps. just typin some things like, what we want to change bout this class, and yeah...its....yeah.  damn me! im getting so confused now....i dont kno who i like, or who to like, or if its jsut one person i like so yeah...  i still dont kno  bout going trick or treating... and the halloween dance on november 1st...i think im gonna go, since my mom is a chaperone (Kill me now! :S) but i dont wanna be a loner. i havnt been able to talk to my friends to see whos goin....and nobodys asked me, haha, im so freakin dumb, no ones gonna ask me, plus theres no reason to ask someone since theres no fee for couples, its just 5 bucks w/o a costume, or 4 bucks w/a costume...how gay. i dont think im gonna dress up for that at all...i dont always like dressing up, specially for halloween, unless its worth it :p   well i wanted to type more, but i gotta do my assignments now, and by the time i'd be able to type, the bell will ring.  damn! he jsut caught me
