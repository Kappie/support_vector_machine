I am 5 feet 5 inches tall, my weight is 55kg. I am slim,very tall for my age, i have short hair, i wear specs my skin complexion is tanned and i have very sharp  attractive features! As a person i am very friendly,humorous,kind,understanding,reliable,artistic,sincere and logical or down to earth! My worst qualities are my dishonesty and my lazyness, these qualities have created loads of problems,misunderstandings in my life and also has created a very bad impression of me. I mean sometimes previously i did not even know half of the time what i was saying!!!!!! Just because of my utter stupidity and dis honesty, my classmates and friends in my school dont trust me and have a bad impression of me.But today i am proud to say that, i have changed a lot, i have stopped making stupid,idiotic tales , i have stopped critizing people, i seldom lie and i always think twice before doing anything!!! Due to god's grace, i have changed a lot for the better, have become a honest person now!Anyway i am studying in std 8 this year at Delhi Public School International Singapore.My schoolstarted  few months ago this year, 19th of april to be precise! School 's cool! I like all my classmates except some of course! Most of my teachers are o.k, prettytolerable, even though some are absolutely weird, all teachers teach really well, clearing all the doubts, they sure know how to teach well even though they are totally nuts!!God, i have loads of homework to complete and there is so much to study , that i dont know where to start and wher to end, life sure is weird!! I will write more tomorrow bye !!
