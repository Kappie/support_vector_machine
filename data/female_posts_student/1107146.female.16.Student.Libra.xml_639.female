And I think a lot of this has to do with Scott, so why don't we attack him instead? We'd probably feel a lot better, and we wouldn't be sitting here beating each other up and taking this situation more places that it shouldn't be. But that's just me.  And he deserves it. Y'hear that Scott (if you're reading this)? You deserve it. Seriously dude. You wanna talk about hypocracy and "sawdust in your neighbor's eye versus plank in own", you should really think more about who's eye the plank is in. And whereas Linds and Abby do have the rage but can keep it to a level passive enough so as to not make any damage, I cannot make such promises. I get unchecked pissed-ness. It annoys me when you attack me behind my back. It INFURIATES me when you attack my girl. Like the kind that actually hurts me until I catharthasize it. And contrary to popular belief, it feels GREAT when I do it.  So if ever again I hear this misinformation being leaked, or that you've been saying some un-nice things about my relationship with Abby, or her,  especially  her, consider yourself a house in the wake of a California forest fire. Kablam goes the last minutes of your feeble and feckless life.   On that note, an excellent night I wish to you all. I started my Poe essay early and the verbosity is simply tenacious upon my nigh-possessed functions. Har Har.
