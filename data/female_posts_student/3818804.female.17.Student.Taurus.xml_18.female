Yeap. Then we swam, dove, and slid into and around the pool. Karen and Anna left and then Denay and I went out. We went to drop of some film at Costco and then we went to Mcdonald's for some grub. I got a parfeit! yum. then she dropped me off at mi casa.   While lounging around poolside we happened to conjur up old memories....it was fun. Like ***** looking like she's lactating and pissed her pants. It was perty funny. And the TJ Maxx lady...yeap. Good times good times...It was cool to go out with Denay too. We don't really hang out one on one so it was cool to talk to her and open that friendship up.   Tomorrow I go to the beach...beaches!!! lolz...  P.S. my uterus hurts again... :(
