On Civilitas, it advertises for Iraqi Dinars (CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT AN IRAQI DINAR IS??), although I'm pretty sure I haven't typed the word Iraq or Iraqi in there. Maybe it thinks..."Bush. What goes with Bush automatically? IRAQ!"  So let's just see about the journals I go to, hmm? All right.    urlLink  Ryan   , he protests against the movie because it sucks in comparison to the book, has an ad for "I-Robot" movie wallpaper, etc. Plus an ad for the book. Which he already owns. So ppshaw. And   urlLink  Urza's    blog has ads for a "simple depression cure" and "gothic poetry." I don't know if you're depressed or what, Urza, but it really doesn't seem like you are. And from what I understand, you are DEFINITELY not Gothic. Er.  One of my other blogger friends,   urlLink  Lor   , found a clever way to block the ads. I had one of those on my old journals, they rock but are hard to place. Too bad I don't get to find what she gets ads for :) foot fungus? Machine guns? THE WORLD WILL NEVER KNOW! :D  And   urlLink  Catfish     has an ad for protecting marine life in the Georgian straight. Might this have something to do with his second post, the Penguin Quiz he took? I guess they had to do that, or use an ad for urinals, as his first post calls blogs the urine of the internet. Like I told him last night, very vulgarly I might add, "everyone must urinate :)"  Thanks again Grant for pointing the ads out...I'm selectively blind and tend to ignore a lot of detail. ^_^
