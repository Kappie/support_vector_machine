In Sikestown there's a restaurant called Lambert's Home of the Throwed Rolls. It is a really fun place to eat. Well the wait to get in was like an hour or more, so we passed the time by going to the gift shop, playing a game called King Toad, and throwing super balls through the parking lot. It was really fun. Well, they actually do throw rolls at you. They came outside and started yelling hot rolls and if you held up your hand they'd throw you a roll. It was so funny. Well, while we were eating, Karen, Courtney, Ashlynne and Me realized we had gained southern accents by being in Missouri too long. Then we couldn't stop talking like that and it was hilarious. So Courtney and Karen decided they were from Texas and that their new "texan" names were Cantaloupe or Cantie for short, that was Karen, and Courtney was Aubrey cuz we had met a girl from Texas who was named Aubrey. It was so funny though. And somehow it came to be that Karen had impregnated Jeff and he was having twins and they're all texan so Karen decided they had to have 2 names cuz everyone from Texas has two names. Courtney suggested Jimmy John but Karen named her twins Tree Frog and Kiwi Banana. We were so tired last night from being at the water park all day that we were just slap happy so everything that came out was so dumb and we just laughed the whole time. And then today somehow we decided Jeff was Saudi Arabian and his name was Jafar and his mom was Jamal. I still don't fully understand that but it was sooooo much fun!
