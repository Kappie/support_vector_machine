Arik makes me soo happy. *sigh* Its unbelievable...what he does to me. Just to hear him breathe....make me flutter inside. Ive never been so happy and so in love in my life. Arik is my world....without him Id be lost. Hes awesome...and Im soo very glad I have him. I thank God for him every night...And I love him soo very much. I don't think anything in life could measure up to what I feel for him. Im having the time of my life...being in love. Thank you Arik....I love you. And Im not going anywhere...I mean it.  -Tara
