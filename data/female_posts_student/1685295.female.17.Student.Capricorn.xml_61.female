It really sucks that the leaders of Hamas are having their assets frozen, while the Israelies are walking away with a little slap on their cheeks. Shouldn't President Bush ask the United Nations to raise some sort of sanctions against Israel; I mean it's understandable if they attack once, but they've been doing it for the last thirteen years.
