I'm still not speaking to my father and my sister just came back from uni but bar that i'm fantastic. (cough*sarcasm*cough)  I can't even have a convostaion with my sister anymore, yesterday i was watching Busted's new video "Thunderbirds" for the new movie and i was like it looks pretty good and then my sister sat up in her chair and was like "well actually kirsty, it's all americanised and they have updated it way to much. The original writer of the comincs (insert name here) hardly had anything to do wiith it and was very dissapointed, blah blah blah" it went on like that for about 10 minutes. She was spurting crap becuase the person who wrote the comics has legal rights.  And  i told her about when i watched a bit of Kill Bill 2. i watched the first 4 minutes and turned it off. It was soooooooooooooooooooo crap. All she was doing was talking about basically how great she was.  Then my sister was all like "well you have to have watched other Tarentino films to appricate the way he changes the perception of certain things blah blah blah" another 10 minutes of crap.   Sorry aren't we supposed to have a opinion now, so what i'm sure you hate some of my favourite films and ever since she has come back from uni she has had this superior tone to her voice whenever she speaks to me like she's better than me.  If i have to listen to one more thing she tells me about "the lightening effect features in this scene are okay, they don't bounce it of the trimordial beams enough to give a good picture of what it would really be like if they were infact inside the beast but there not which is completly flase...Blah blah blah." i might have to use a line from MOM from futurama and say  "Cram a squirrel up your ass" Mom's great:D  Enought ranting, i'm doing a update for Arcadian Rebellion and mum is really thinking about letting me go and transfer schools to america. super:D  I can't wait, it'll really be a fresh start which i so despartly need.   Anyho i'll leave you with a quote from Luke (Joan of Arcadia) from the episode Drive, He said.  Joan and Luke see a figure walking along the road towards the car. Luke:(panicked voice) Go around him, he's got a chainsaw.  Later:D
