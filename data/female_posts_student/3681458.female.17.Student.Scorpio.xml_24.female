Work today was okay... Krystle cracks me up. She's awesome.  Saw Jason tonight. Went and gave him a massage after work, and took him a rootbeer float, a chocolate covered strawberry, and a couple PB buckets. Heh. I'm nice =). I guess we decided that we'd be friends, but that sorta went up in smoke. Don't really know what's happening. Eh.  Saw Amandaat work. Gosh I love her. She's awesome, and I can talk to her about anything. I'm glad we're getting to bebetter friends. Especially recently. She's beencoming over alot.  Talked to Nathan tonight. Seems that we can never really get a conversation going. Something usually happens. Blah. I hate that about him. I really want to be better friends with him. I can't maintain a conversation with him.  My sister is dumb. She thinks I can't figure out the mileage for the car, and whether or not she put gas in it. Good lord. What kind of an idiot does she think I am? I'm not. I've had phsyics and all the simple math I need to figure out how much gas you would need, how many gallons were in the car. etc. etc. I can't wait to have my own car. Oh gosh, I can't wait. She's such a slob it annoys the piss out of me.  But moving right along... I think I"m going to go to sleep now. But anywho. Have a good'n.
