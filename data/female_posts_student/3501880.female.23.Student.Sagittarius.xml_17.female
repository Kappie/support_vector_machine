Listening To:   iTunes Party Shuffle--Radiohead's "Paranoid Android"    Watching:   Definitely NOT  For the Love of the Game  with Kevin Costner    Mood:  Gluttonuous...I slept in until 1pm today!!!   _______________________________________________________  This last year, I have established a new standard of living for myself: I do not want to have a roommate unless we are fucking. No, this does not mean that I want to establish that kind of relationship with my roommate just so we can still live together (Ew!). Simply, if I have another roommate, it will be a live-in boyfriend arrangement.  I guess I have just come to a point in my life where the economy of having roommate does not outweigh the benefits of living alone. I feel too old to continue to have the same disagreements about doing the dishes, who took out the trash last, or when I can have guests over to the apartment. If I am to have these arguments, it better be offset by regular sex.  I have paid my respects to the Gods of Bad Roommates with the following roommates:   Chewy and Slappy:  My first apartment was at Utah State. I shared an apartment with five other girls, having only a bathroom with a shower and another with a toilet. I got along fine with most of my roommates, except for a pair of sisters that I soon dubbed "Chewie and Slappy".   Chewie got her name because she looked like, well, a wookie. A huge mane of pubic hair extended from her head, and had a propensity for leaving "Little Chewies" around various places in the apartment, namely the couch, the kitchen counter, and my least favorite place, the shower drain. One of my other roommates, Melanie, and I asked Chewie repeatedly to clean her hair out of the shower drain, and she would let out a low, mournful groan (a la Chewbacca), which we took as a sign of compliance. Yet, morning after morning, I would groggily make my way into the shower and find a "Little Chewie" greeting me in the drain. Melanie and I took a more drastic measure and made a sign that read, "Please clean your hair out of the drain!", posting it on the bathroom wall.  For greater emphasis, Melanie artistically embellished the sign by drawing little tufts of hair along the borders. Chewie either choose to ignore the sign or simply could not read, because a colony of "Little Chewies" continued to reside in the shower drain until the day I moved out.   Slappy originally proved to be more tolerable than her sister. She had been genetically blessed with a lack of fur, and actually was rather enjoyable to engage in discussions of literature, history, and philosophy. But Slappy could be moody. In fact, she had a wicked case of depression, and you never quite knew when it would make an appearance.   One day, Melanie and I decided to go over to our neighbor's apartment and make a prank call to our apartment. Slappy answered, and we conducted our prank, which cleverly consisted of us screaming "Hey! Shutup!" into the phone and hanging up. Okay, so it wasn't that clever, but I guess you had to be there. As Melanie and I sauntered back into the apartment, feeling very pleased with ourselves, Slappy (who had answered the phone) cornered me, administered a good slap on the face, and stormed off towards her room. Partly out of shock and partly not sure if she had been joking, I yelled back, "Hey, don't hit people, you hussy!". Slappy yelled something about our lack of maturity (well, she was right), and slammed her bedroom door.    I filed a complaint with our Resident Assistant, and Melanie and I wrote up a statement of the incident. As a result, Slappy got "a stern lecture" and was forced to write a letter of apology.  ******   Kathy:  When Kathy and I first moved in, we had been the only ones living in a rather large house that rented out rooms individually. Kathy had a strange look to her: she was about 5'3" and roughly 100lbs. I could not tell if she appeared to be either 35 or 12 (at the time, she was 24). Her favorite things included: Scooby Doo, Days of Our Lives, Sweet Valley High, Pepsi, chocolate cake, Lays potato chips, and large hunks of cheese. Her dislikes included: her stepmother, personal hygiene, telling the truth, and homosexuals.  Kathy was passionate about Days of Our Lives. I got the impression that she might have thought that the characters actually existed. One time, she came home about 10 minutes before the start of the show, and I was watching an episode of Maury.  Kathy: Are you watching that show? Me: yes Kathy:(looks shifty and nervous)Oh... Me:(silence) Kathy:(looks at her watch) Me:(pretending to be innocent) Is there something that you were wanting to watching? Kathy: (looks relieved) YES! (jumps up and changes channel to Days of Our Lives. She rocks back and forth to comfort her nerves.) Me: Oh, I hate Stefano! Kathy: That DAMN Stephano...Always ruining the lives of others!!!!  Another time, Kathy came home and engaged me in this conversation...  Kathy: Guess what I heard on the radio today! Me: What? Kathy: There is a SONG about SCOOBY DOO!!!! Me: Really? What did it sound like? Kathy: I don't know, it had something about Scooby Snacks! Me: Oh, you mean, LFO's "Girl on TV"? Kathy: I guess so! Me: Uh, that song isn't about Scooby Doo.. Kathy: I am pretty sure it is! Me: sure, okay...  The next semester, more people had moved into the house. The other girls became just as freaked out by Kathy as I was. One girl, Heidi, took up the habit of rummaging through Kathy's things for tangible evidence that Kathy was psychotic. During one of these snooping sessions, Heidi found that she had piles and piles of paper towels that she had rolled up and used as sanitary napkins, but never threw away.   In a way, I sort of felt bad for Kathy, as her mother died when she was a teenager. Her dad remarried and her stepmother treated her terribly. I had a theory that sometimes when people have a traumatic event in their lives, they sometimes get stuck in that time and never seem to progress emotionally and physically from that point on. That is why we have so many 50 year old women with large bangs and blue eyeshadow. I always thought this applied to Kathy. When her mother died, she became physically and emotional stunted, and that is why she loved her Scooby Doo, Sweet Valley High, Babysitter's Club, and Days of Our Lives so dearly. These things reminded her of happier times.   The last I heard of Kathy had been that she had been visiting the cemetery to try to talk to the dead. I am pretty sure she got this idea from Days of Our Lives, but the act landed her in a mental institution. Oh, Marlena would have been proud...  ******   Nora:  Nora had been one of my closest friends in college, and we ended up living together several times throughout the years. She really hadn't been that bad of a roommate, but sometimes her lack of common sense was irritating.   The most classic example was when she kept clogging the toilet. It wasn't that Nora took impressive dumps, but rather, she seemed to use about a half roll of toilet paper for even the littlest tinkle. As a result, she perpetually clogged the toilet.   The first time this happened, all of us had been caught completely offguard. We had no plunger, and no of us knew about the valve at the base of the toilet to shut off the water. Thus, the urine-filled water overflowed onto the floor and carpet in Nora's room until we procured a plunger from the neighbor boys. My favorite image burned into my memory is Nora standing in the tub trying to unclog the toilet with red, hot, tear-stained checks moaning, "Why did this happen to me?!?!?". She then asked if she could use some of my towels to soak up the carpet that had been saturated with her urine. I winced, but then brought her some of my crappiest towels.  Nora: I will make sure to wash your towels. Me: Don't worry about it, just keep them!  I would have thought that Nora might have learned from experience, but it hadn't been more than a couple weeks later when my other roommates and I stood in the kitchen chatting, and Nora came out crying, slammed her door, and said, "Why does this KEEP happening?"  Me: What keeps happening? Nora: The toilet! Roommate 1: Did you clog it? Nora: Yes Roommate 2: Did it overflow? Nora: Yes Roommate 1: Is it STILL overflowing? Nora: Yes Me: Want me to go get the plunger from the boys? Nora: NO!!! Me: Why not? Nora: Cause I don't want them to know I clogged the toilet! Me: I am going to go get the plunger... Nora: Just don't tell them it was me that clogged the toilet.  I walked over to our neighbors. My friend, Chad, answered the door. The first thing I said had been that Nora clogged the toilet. Chad replied simply, "Again?" and handed me the plunger that had been waiting by the door from the last time. Back at the apartment with plunger in hand, I surveyed the damage. This time, the overflowing toilet had chucks of fecal matter floating in urine-spiked watered. Also, because of Nora's inaction in resolving the situation, the mess had seeped out into the hallway and part of the living room.  Nora: Can I borrow some towels to clean up the mess? Me: Not a fucking chance.  I made Nora call our landlord to inform him of the problem and to clean up the mess, thinking he would have the carpet cleaned. Instead, a few days later, he shows up with a large fan to dry out the carpet. Call me crazy, but I am pretty sure that if I had rental property, I would not want to merely resolve fecal matter that had soaked into the carpet with a large fan.  ****  As a result of Chewie and Slappy, Krazy Kathy, and Nora and Her Magical Overflowing Toilet, I feel that I have gained the necessary life experience of eccentric roommates, and have come to the conclusion that the only eccentricities in the apartment should be my own or the person's whom I'm fucking.
