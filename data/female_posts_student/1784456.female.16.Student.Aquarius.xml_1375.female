I've lost my English book and I need to type up coursework! AARGH! Ahh don't worry... found it! It's Great Expectations coursework, kind of interesting actually. (Well it's better than history's - copy but rework homework) Erm... just remembered I haven't cleaned my teeth. (Crappy excuse to leave aye?) Better than Emma's 'baby sitting' one.
