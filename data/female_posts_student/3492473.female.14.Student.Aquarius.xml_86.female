But it's crazy because he feels the same way I do about our family. The less we see of them, the less we care. And it's really strange for my brother to say that or talk about growing up and everything else he was writing about. I guess the thing that separates me from my brother is that  I have hope.  Hope that everything will one day be as good as it was. Hell, I know my parents are never gonna get back together. But that doesn't mean I can't pray every night that my mom allows us to see my dad or the rest of my family. Like I was telling Maura, once I'm 16 and I can drive, I'm not gonna be hanging out w/ my friends every chance I get.  I'm gonna be with my family.  Hanging out w/ Katie and going to see my dad. Catching up on all the years I lost. I mean when it comes down to it, family means a lot. I used to think I didn't need any of my family. Boy was I wrong. There's something about losing the ones you loved for years and wondering what you did wrong that they don't wanna be in your life, that's makes you realize,  you do need them!  7 years is a really long time and let me tell you...I cried a lot during those 7 years. I was angry at the beginning and didn't care but then, as I got older, I looked at the "big" picture. And I realized I was angry because he wasn't there. I missed him and wanted him and loved him and needed him to be there for me. I feel the farthest from my dad compared to Eddie and Margaret. I mean Margaret lived with him for 2 years (when she was 16-18) and Eddie had a longer time with him than I did. I mean I was 6 when my parents got divorced. How was I suppose to have a solid relationship with my dad then? My parents are two completely different people and I love them both. Despite major flaws. I forgive but I don't forget. I guess part of me is scared to face reality. I honestly don't know if my dad has fixed his drinking problem. Both times I saw him he just kept throwing back beers but he didn't seem fazed by them... I dunno, my dad is a sensitive subject with me. Forgetting all the bad crap,  he really was a great dad.  And, here I am crying over him again, because I want to be his little girl again. I still wonder if he'll be at my graduation or if he'll see me go to Prom. I just wanna know if he's gonna be there for me. I just wanna know for sure so I can stop killing myself worrying about this. I just want to be make everything better. I just want to be a happy family again...
