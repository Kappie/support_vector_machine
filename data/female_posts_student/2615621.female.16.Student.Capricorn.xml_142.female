So far this has happened...  I came home saturday and mom and john were taking the wallpaper off the walls in the boy's room. mom didnt act too excited to see me..she hasnt seen me in like 2 months, but still, john is like number one in her life. i totally blew up at her cuz i mean, hello..she first told me i could go to the GRAHAM COLTON BAND concert, and thought it was a "wonderful" idea, as im sure you've read many excited posts about it and her reaction..but john said it was up to her if we all went, and u know..she always has to be the mega bitch, and says "i dont think we're gonna do that.." her excuse? "i dont want to make john pay for it" well umm..he'd only have to buy HIS ticket, and yeah, he'd offer to buy urs, i saved up my damn money, but noo..she doeant want him to spend ANY money on ANYTHING i might enjoy. but she doesnt mind if they go shopping or to Hondorus, or even out to some restraunt...wow...anyways, i totally threw a fit and i wasnt even gonna ask about the conecert, but hopefully Lauren and her parents will take us :D so theres still hope..even though i dont have my hopes up, just my fingers crossed. Saturday nite kaela and i went to eat dinner together, TCBY sundaes..yummy!! then we went to walmart and the mall, thats another story in itself, which will be told in a few mins, then we went to zack's house and saw lauren, andrew, and katie..oh and yeah..zack. lol fun stuff. i ended up inviting lauren and katie (haha i started to type zack..) to spend the nite. well i invited lauren, but katie asked if she could come, i dont remember her exact quote, but im sure lauren can tell u. haha They all came over at about 11..and thats another story that will be told sortly. But the point is, when everyone was gone sunday morning, i spent the whole day again by myself..mom and john went for a ride in the convertiable on the parkway...leaving me all alone in my house cuz the boys were off playing at a friends house and whatever they do. so once again, a day of my summer is spent completely alone. when i brought it up to my mom she said "oh i didnt know that would make u so upset" no, u just didnt care. So, while im yappin about my mom, today we totally get into another fight. i wanted to go bra shopping and get some jeans and i asked while we were in the car after dropping glenn off at a friends, and she said "i wanna go home" so..we went home..and i was like "oo werent we gonna take grandma to the flower place?" and she said "yeah, later.." so then im driving along and asked one more time.."well, can we stop at the mall later?" and she finally says is "i have lunch plans" okay..lunch plans with john..yeah...always something. so then im like "what about tonite?" ..."we're going to dinner tonite.." and i have to babysit because roberta is also going out. dont get me wrong, i love babysitting and getting extra cash, but i also like going to the mall and actually getting outta tha house, without people outside my family..friends of mine are like family, so they dont count. but u know..neighbors shouldnt have to be apart of my everyday breathing life. but who cares..im using his computer right now lol BUT my mom did mangage to tell me i was going to go live with my dad and to call him up..i told her he was at work and stormed outta the room, well, im not going to live with my dad, do u know how many times shes used that one? anyways, she told me i was a bitch and jealous of her having a boyfriend, u know the same old shit she always says. and how shes done her job, which includes "providing you with a home and food" well, my responce was "wow mom, i thought love and caring weren't in the job discribition and u just proved me right" so since her kids can now walk and talk she doesnt have to do anything at all..great mom right there. dammit, shes the biggest bitch ive ever met. And she wonders why i act mad at her..hmm *read everything in this blog and maybe u'll find the answer*  Now, back to kaela, lauren and katie. they spent the nite and we had a great time. kaela was kinda pissed at me at first cuz i invited them over and before we went to zacks we went to her bfs house..she ALWAYS sees her bf, she was like more excited to see him than go to the mall with me. whats new? so anyways, after i sat around in his living room for like 45mins watching COPS on tv i finally said KAELA LETS GOOOOOO she got all pissed off and was like FINE! so we went to zacks..and according to kaela "inviting lauren and katie..julia..come on, u were about to die at justins and we werent there long, now i have to see ur friends all nite" THERES A DIFFERENCE IN SEEING MY FRIENDS AND UR BF. i told her she sees justin all the time, and i havent gotten to see lauren or katie at all. well..she said it was the same thing. hmm i dont think so. its my damn house, i'd invite the damn pope over if i wanted and paint his nails black. anyways, she shut up after she smoked a few cigarettes, which by the way according to her are "so stupid, julia if u smoke or drink..i swear..." and she was eyeing the vodka all nite and smokin. umm u damn hypocrit! anyways  We went to walmart before all of that, and we dressed up in this police oufit, with the huge dark sunglasses, handcuffs on our jeans, hats, nite sticks, whistle, and play gun (we left in the car). we ran around yelling RIOT CONTROL!! yup.."u make em, we break em" and we went up to strangers and asked them to break up their riots before we had to interfere. lol it was soo funny. then we went to the mall, where i attempted to arrest the security guard and we handcuffed someone to those things they pull down over the store entrance when they close..it was fun. lol we looked cool. lmao!  Hmm...anything else i need to talk about? let me think...oh yeah  At zacks house he did our tarrot card readings...one of mine was like "ur nieve, childish, and pretending to be someone your not"...well...im sure uve read the post about me being a "poser". whatever, i have tried to be a lil more mature and try to be "myself" or what kaela and ashley think is "myself" but that doesnt make any sense..how canu PRETEND to be URSELF? hmm oh and my love reading told me i was on a manhunt, and the "romeo guy" im looking for "aka mr. perfect" aka..danny...aka the list...isnt gonna work out cuz he does something de-seat-ful(sp?) and i break it off or something..i dunno i forgot that part, but then in the end i do find the mr perfect im looking for. yays. but dammit, i hope someone else comes around that is my mr perfect and knocks danny outta that spot, so i can like be with danny...lol cuz he seems cool. anyways...yeah...so once again, tarrot cards are true. i wish i had remembered what mine said back in 8th grade when zack did them.   Sarah called me the other nite and we talked about funny stuff..and how yea, lauren is gonna hafta to come to her house with me. we're gonna hang with jordan (girl), andrew, clement, gary and sarah..and prob jordans bf devin. but hey..they ALL might spend the nite with sarah..never spent the nite with a dude before..esp messed up ones LMAO. yays lauren! haha  I think ive covered it all..and if anything excited has happened that i left out, im sure i called u lauren and told u...so tuff stuff random readers :p  *much love and magic beans*  ps: im cool cuz i like to wear spiderman bandaids for the hell of it :D
