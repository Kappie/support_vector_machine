Their competitive streak makes them prone to closing-time shot contests. They're sloppy, fun drunks, and they get mighty flirty after a couple tipples. Getting Aries people drunk is a good way to get what you want out of them, should other methods fail. Aries can become bellicose when blotto, but they will assume that whatever happened should be forgiven (if not forgotten) by sunrise. They can be counted on to do the same for you -- so long as you haven't gone and done anything really horrible to them last night, you sneaky Gemini.  Trademark cocktails Aries, born under the hot-stuff planet Mars, is the ruler of spicy food and red things -- and for balance, astrologers recommend they eat tomatoes, onions, olives and greens. That's right, Aries, you were born under the sign of the bloody Mary. Aries also rules grapefruit, and they've been known to kick back a salty dog and a sea breeze or two. For extreme hotcha, try a concoction with cinnamon liqueur in it.  Drinking buddies Marlon Brando, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Al Gore, Thomas Jefferson, Elton John, Eric McCormack, Rosie O'Donnell, Sarah Jessica Parker, Reese Witherspoon   My Response: ARIES ROCK!  Loved this, cause sadly it’s just true.    Competitive? Check.    Sloppy and Fun drunk? Check.    Flirty?  OH MY GOD YES, EMBARASSINGLY SOMETIMES!  Didn’t you know everyone wants to get with me when I am drunk!?  J  Do things I shouldn’t do when drunk?  Check.    Do I think it should be forgiven come morning?  Check.    Forgive what others did the night before?  Half the time I can’t even remember… so check.    Have to disagree with the Bloody Mary… after the Vodka Night in Boston… um no.  I’m sticking with beer and gin.    Cinnamon Liqueur?  No.  Gross.    And then we get to the drinking buddies?  Um, why do the Aries guys make out in this situation? SMG, SJP, RW and well RO’D but still… and I get Fat Ugly WEIRDO, No idea who Ferlinghetti is, um former VP who claimed to invent the internet, DEAD GUY, Gay Guy, and Plays a Gay Guy on TV?
