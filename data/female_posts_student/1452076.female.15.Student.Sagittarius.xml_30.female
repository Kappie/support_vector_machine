Do come and show us your support! This fiesta will be showcasing the Top 10 bands. 5 tomorrow and the other 5 next week. Besides NYCB, St. Patrick and River Valley will be performing too. I can't remember the other two bands.  I had a hell of a time at church today. I never knew church could be so much fun. Now I'm looking forward to it more than ever! I was still wondering what will I have to look forward to to get me through the school week after the Youth Day celebrations. I shall make it point not to be late for Sabbath next Saturday.
