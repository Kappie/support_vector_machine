Must of come from days of seeing Izzy! (Aaargh!) Hehe, so fuuun! I've been on a creative day today! I tried to tidy my room but I ended up making it into a creative mess! Yeay! I had ska music on, my red light and I was actually cleaning up my room - it was madness! But no one's phoned and saved me from myself! :'( Usually I have to answer the phone about a billion times and it's never for me any way! Oh well. Mmm... now I'm halucinating the doorbell and the phone! Oh yeay! ...without even taking drugs, god aren't I admazing! (Not amazing!) Better go sit downstairs so I can pass the door and make sure I'm not going crazy!
