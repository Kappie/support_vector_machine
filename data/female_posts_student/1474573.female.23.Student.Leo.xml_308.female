I mean, it's the same feeling of rushing home to watch MTV because they're going to World Premiere the new Duran Duran video.  It just  has  to be seen.  Tonight was disco night and unfortunately Jasmine sounded like she was ripping her throat out singing, she was so hoarse.  I tried to vote for the other three these past 2 hours but the lines were all busy.  Good to know.  Thought about throwing in a pity vote for Jasmine, but then I remembered the Jennifer Hudson 'nobody voted for the right people' fiasco and put the phone down.  24 was off the hizz-ook and I worry what I'm going to do with myself once this season is over.  Fa-sniffle ma-niffle.  On a totally random note, I finally used the  urlLink Gazelle Freestyle Trainer  we bought and it kicked my ass.  Owwie.
