Chelsea spent the night last night, so she went with me. lol, she sorta got frustrated with having to wear a skirt. Then we came home, changed, watched Grease, ate, and Chelsea went home. I still haven't straightened up my room. The trundle bed is still out. lol! *ish a lazy bum!!!* anywho..... I couldn't sleep at all last night! It was driving me crazy! I stopped talking to Nick online last night, then I went to bed, (Chelsea had already fallen asleep) and then lo and behold....I couldn't go to sleep!!!!!! but ah well, I got to think of Nick, so it wasn't all that bad. lol. Actually, I think it was probly Nick's fault I COULDN'T go to sleep until maybe 2 this morning. but don't worry about it darlin, it doesn't bother me.   Anywho, after Chelsea left, I didn't do too much. made a meatloaf, watched The Sound of Music with Inky. pretty calm day, if ya ask me. actually, it was rather boring. Glad school is tommorrow. ANIME CONVENTION IS FRIDAY!!!!!!! *can hardly contain the excitement* I get to spend 2 days with Nick! and with other people too...but still!!!! I can hardly wait! hehehe...must be going now. Love, Shannon "If masochists like being tortured, then wouldn't the best torture for them be not to be tortured at all?" --(dunno who said it, but I thought it was funny)
