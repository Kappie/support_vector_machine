I think we should all vent at Starbucks this weekend.  Laugh and cry like an old eighties movie and I'll be the pregnant star who dies in child birth after the discovery of my breast cancer.  "goin to the chapel, and we're gonna get married.  gee I really love you and we're gonna get married, goin to the chapel of love."  Gee what ever happened those good old oldies songs.  I miss 'em.  Man I feel like listening to the gay musical stylings of The Producers.
