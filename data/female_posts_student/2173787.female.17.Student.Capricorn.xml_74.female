Lately there have been so many reminders that life does not go on forever and I can no longer hide from them.  The recent death of Angela Stapelton and what should have been Dukie's 18th borthday have finally gotten into my thick skull where they are gathering and brooding.  In time both events along with countless other heart wrenching tales will be swept away and forgotten, just a single stone marker, somewhere, left behind.  Kanata is dedicating a building to Dukie, but over time it will be like the picture that hangs in the lodge, something to remember a kid that no one truly remembers.  We all do stupid things, why is it that only some of us die for them.  And what of the innocent, who did nothing, but still are gone?  I hate thinking of dark things, and instead choose to tell myself that there is some logic to all of this, but i cannot fathom what it might be.  Why is it that so many happy, good people are gone while the world is filled with bitter people filled with hate?  why is it that we can capture tyrants alive and unscathed, yet children die just because they rode the bus to school? I'm angry right now but i don't know what at.  Surely it cannot be G-d, because that is where my hope resides; so maybe its people, even though i believe that they are innately good.  I don't know who to blame and that bothers me greatly.
