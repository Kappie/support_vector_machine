MAJOR issues. i think i need help. like brain help. or just help in general. whatever. oh yeah, remember that "route i took as an out" a little while back? turns out that route was only a short detour. now im back on track. and thats all i have to say...     There are times I swear I know you're here When I forget about my fears Feeling you my dear Watching over me, and my hope sees What the future will bring, When you wrap me in your wings  And take me where you are  Where you and I will be together Once again, we'll be dancing in the moonlight just like we used to do And you'll be smiling back at me Only then will I be free, when I can be Where you are  And I can see your face  Your kiss I still can taste  My memory awaits  Ohh, I see your star,shining down on me  And I'd do anything if I can just  Be right there where you are  Where you and I will be together Once again, we'll be dancing in the moonlight just like we used to do And you'll be smiling back at me Only then will I be free, when I can be Where you are  And baby there are times when selfishly  I'm wishing that you were here with me So I can wipe the tears from your eyes and make you see That every night while you are dreaming I'm here to guard you from afar And anytime I feel alone I close my eyes and dream of where you are  Where you and I will be together Once again, we'll be dancing in the moonlight just like we used to do And you'll be smiling back at me Only then will I be free, when I can be Where you are  Baby, I still believe, Oh, I've got to believe I'll touch you that sweet day That you take me there where you are   jessica simpson  nick lachey - "where you are"
