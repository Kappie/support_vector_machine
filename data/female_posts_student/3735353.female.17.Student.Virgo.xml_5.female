I didn't write yesterday cause nothing really happened. I spent all day with CM and then came home and read last night.  I started this new book called "The Secert Life of Bees". It's really good.  Cm called me last night and said he was going to Craig's and they were just gonna hang out over at Craig's house. So I told him to call me when he was on his way home.  I fell asleep about 1:45 and then at like 3:45 my cell phone rang and it was Christian.  He said that he was so pissed cause he went to Razoo's (after he told me he wasn't going to go there. He said he went to meet Craig...not sure if I believe that or not.)and Jackie was there and then they left Razoo's and went to some bar and then CM and Craig went back to Craigs and this guy named Ivan (HAHA-Like in Theatre I, Ivan the great!)wanted to start a fight with Christian cause Jackie told Ivan that CM was talking shit about him. Whatever.  Turns out that Jackie told this guy that Christian was talking mess when in reality Christian didn't say anything and he thought that him and this Ivan guy were cool. But then they almost got into a fight and then CM found out it was Jackie talking mess and so they let it go and Christian went to confront Jackie and she ran inside her house so that they couldn't talk.  UUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH. It's all so much fucking drama. I hate it. It's the stupidest thing ever. I just want her to go away and ruin someone else's life for a little while. Christian says that he's not going to be her friend anymore, but I find that very hard to believe. Everytime something like this happens, he always says "I'm done with her. She's a psycho bitch...blah blah." But then he always ends up being friends with her again.  Like the other night, I got home from vacation and I went over to his house. Well while I was there, jackie called him. And as far as I knew, he wasn't talking to jackie. Turns out that he hung out with her and Craig while I was gone on vacation. And he didn't tell me because, as he said, he was affraid I was going to get mad. THATS SUCH BULLSHIT. Did he think it was a better idea for me to find out this way than for him to just tell me in the first place. GOD! Its like nothing that involves Jackie is ever easy, or completely without alternative motives.   It just sucks thats all. And I'm getting so tired of it. ITS OLD!  Whatever. Well, Christian is supposed to be here any minute (I actually exapected him long before now) but I guess I will let you go.  I'll try my hardest to write tonight if anything worth write about happens.  *whitney*
