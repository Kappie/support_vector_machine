I gave my hair a hot oil treatment, and took a shower for like an hour and a half... well at least until our hot water ran out and then I just took a cold shower for about 15 minutes, so ya know. I've been online  way  too much today. I wish I had something to do, but I'm stranded at home, and nobody is here, and I don't my license so I'm stuck! Well I don't really have anything to say. I need to free-write for Johnson's class as well. So Ciao
