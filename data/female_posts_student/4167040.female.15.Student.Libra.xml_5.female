We are seriously at the point where we can like finish eachothers sentences, no joke. If I'm trying to say something...but I don't know how to say it...Jeff can explain it for me, and I can do the same for him. It's sooo cool to have someone there for you like that. He's like my older brother, watching out for me, teaching me everything...he's the coolest and most amazing person you will ever meet. I just wanted to say how lucky I feel to have Jeff as my bestest friend in the whole entire world!
