I'm having a hard time connecting with the LORD the last few days - probably because I've been spending so much time at work.    But tonight was my last night at Russ's Market!  Woo!  If I wasn't so tired, I'd be doing the happy dance.  I had a really weird conversation with two guys that I work with.  These are two guys that I've spent a lot of time talking to/investing in.  I don't normally talk to guys about relationships, but every once in a while I get really surprised by the fact that the  guys  bring it up.  So tonight I fielded all sorts of questions, like "when was the last time you dated someone?"  "what kinds of things do you look for in a guy?"  "have you ever had a one night stand?" "you like older guys, don't you?" etc.  Obviously these two guys aren't believers...but it was an interesting conversation.  I'm always intrigued when God gives me a little window into the male psyche, even if they aren't believers.  They're just so  different  than girls.  Duh, Captain Obvious, right?  But I'm so used to thinking like a girl that it's a huge challenge to try and think like a guy.  Or even to understand the way a particular guy is thinking.    Anyways, the reason this whole conversation began was because I found out today that my ex-boyfriend is getting  MARRIED .  The only guy I've ever had a significant romantic relationship with is getting married.  It's just a weird thought.  I still don't know how to react to that.  The two guys that I work with were intrigued by my flabbergastedness (I know that's not a word, but I like non-words).  After all, aren't you just supposed to know how things make you feel?  Well, I don't, not in this case.  It's just  WEIRD .  One of the things I'm kind of frustrated about in my relationship with God is that I know He's giving me dreams - I can remember them momentarily in the morning when I wake up - but I can never remember them long enough to write them down.  I know that He's speaking to me in the night watches, and I want to listen, I want to remember.  I suppose He just hasn't released that gift to me yet...  LORD, I pray that you would unleash the gift of prophetic dreaming in my life.  Make me receptive to your Spirit as I sleep, and help me to remember what You speak to me while I'm resting in You.  Give me discernment to understand.  You are good, LORD, and your purposes are true.  Don't let my frustration be a barrier between us.  Help me to trust in Your timing and Your mercy.
