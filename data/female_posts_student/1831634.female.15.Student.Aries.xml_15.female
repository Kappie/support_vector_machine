(but of course I didn't just say that.)  you know, I think having ppl telling me 24/7 that I like jack is making my mind twisted.  Now I'm not sure if I do or don't.  -___-;;  (though I still think it's mostly a big fat NO)  (but my mind is being twisted.)  (I hate a twisted mind.)  (AND I have no clue what it feels like to like someone... so I think I don't.  because I think [from what I've heard], that if you like someone, you know you like that person.)  (so... happy verdict.. I don't like him.)  see, being up at 2 in the morning on a freaking annoying laptop is getting to me.  I really really hate laptops.  oh, and if you feed me any of my own words from up there ^ later today or tomorrow or whatever, I will categorically deny EVERYTHING.  hehe.  (I can be impractical at 2 in the morning.)  but he's reaaaaaaally pretty.  for a guy.  "pretty", notice, NOT "hot" or "cute" or god forbid.... "sexy".  geeeeeez.  that is SO disturbing.  and he's nice.  kinda.  once he stops being impatient.  which is... almost never.  -____-;;  he's a lot nicer in person than he is online.  imho, of course.  kailing is rambling on about mints.  right.  IT'S 2 NOW!!  ++sunny
