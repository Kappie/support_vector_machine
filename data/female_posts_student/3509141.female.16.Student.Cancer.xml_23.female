I would like to say, however, that this blog is as serious as it gets. What I write here is, in truth, for my personal benefit. It's like a reality TV series, where the prize is better self understanding.  Now, Max, u seem like a smart person and ur depiction of how someone like me may end up living is, by all means very plausible. I even respect ur decision in not living the way I've chosen to live. Except, I've never made this choice. And I can't change the way I am. At least, not without help. How can I choose the other road if I don't no how far back was the last fork? Unfortunately, ur comments recognized many of the things that r "wrong" in the way I think and live but does nothing to help me change.  As for whether I want to change, I don't no. The one dominant thing in me seems to be a transandant laziness. Not just the kind of laziness that makes me not do hw simply because I don't want to go get my backpack from downstairs. It's the kind of laziness that shapes my personality and attitude toward an easy lifestyle. However, this laziness of mine contracts my yearning for greatness. One side will eventually win out but I just can't be bothered to make a decision right now.  The desperate question is this: When I do choose a path, will it be too late to go down it? Time and the world won't wait for me as I let my desires decide for me my fate. I'll graduate high school and go to post-secondary. I'll grow up. The further u go down a road, the harder it is to turn back. If it so happens that by the time I arrive at a decision, it seems incredibly difficult to turn around, will I just go alone the same path as before?  All this make it seem that it's all so urgent. I'm a procrastinator. I leave stuff off for tommorow. It's a bad habit but in a case like this, is it so wrong? I don't no what career path I'm going to take. I don't no what kind of car or house or anything I want. These r life-long decisions. I've been told this too many times by too many people. Now, is the decision on how to live my life the same? Or is it so important that it is made now that it will shape the rest of my life?  I simply don't care. I don't no what to do. I don't want to make the decision. I'll prolly do the same thing I do with everything else--Leave it for tommorow. Who nos when tommorow will actually come?
