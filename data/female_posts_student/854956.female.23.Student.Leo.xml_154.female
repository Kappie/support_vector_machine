Minus the fact that I have TONS of homework this weekend, I'm ready to relax on Sunday and Monday!  :-)  I think I'm gonna get the rest of my evil homework out of the way in snippets.  I have like, 5 pages of Music Theory homework... BLAH!  Then I have a bunch of math homework.  I also need to go out and buy some Zip disks for my music tech. class.  I have to study for my quiz in that class, too.  Anyhow, I'm gonna go back and lay in bed for a bit more til I have to jump in the shower and eat some lunch before going to campus for lab.  BLAH!  :-)
