ROB,SELIN,CARMELLA,CHLOE,LIZ. hehehe. i actually have more but you know, i cant be bothered to write more. my rebellion, is what made me cause this website to be made, cool name huh?  REBELLION For enfield scouts only... im fed up of martin, our group leader, he is sexist, and he has more hair than a thousand gorrilas put together. im sick of him and his son george. he practically dotes on the kid, we might as well give him a crown! All the games he picks FOR US, are the ones that HIS son can do best! IM SICK OF IT! and im sure you are too. so here is the plan. AND WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING AGAINST THE RULES!!!!! we are going to do exactly what he wants us to do, but with extremes, here is martins list of what a perfect scout group is.........(OPINION)  MARTINS PERFECT SCOUT GROUP 1) Works as a team.         SOLUTION: We play cards 2) Is quite and sincere.    SOLUTION: we dont laugh, and we speak like robots. all sad:( 3) does not fight or quarrelSOLUTION: we are only happy if we lose something. 4) Wants to learn           SOLUTION: WE only want to do scout work NO GAmes   It will be hard comrades, but i feel that after a few weeks of utmost misery, martin will be asking us to be the way we are now. Im not trying to get him out of the group, im just trying to make him realise that his perfect scout group isnt that perfect at all. MInd you i would like him out, but that is not the object of this rebellion.  PLEASE POST A COMMENT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE PART OR SUGGEST A DIFFERENT PLAN............
