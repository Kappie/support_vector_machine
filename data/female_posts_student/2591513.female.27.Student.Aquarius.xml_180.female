LMAO  That is exactly how I feel but I know i have to get some things done because my house is in desparate need of some attention.    I want to pain the house.  Seriously, I want something other than just white walls...they look so BLAH!  I want my room to be some sort of tan color and make it like a beach theme....that way my bathroom would kinda match...what do you think?  I don't know.  I love the beach, I just hate being under the sun and well the ocean, being in it.  haha  The one thing I LOVED doing was going to the beach in Santa Cruz and watching the sunset.  I loved how peaceful it made me feel.  I always wanted a house near the ocean.  I think that is why I miss Oceanside so much.  Our housing was relatively near the ocean.  One day I will be able to buy a house out there and live a happy life...a happier life.
