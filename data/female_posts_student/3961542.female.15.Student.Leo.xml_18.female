The only down side to the day was that i had to get up early to be dressed and ready to walk down to the station to get the train.     I nearly fainted though which was quite scary.Im not sure why.     It was just shopping for school stuff, but it was something different, and i now know what i want to get my ickle fwendies for crimbo.It might only have turned August but it doesnt hurt to get some ideas.Lol.     In the...um.. square bit in Nottingham with the big fountain and stuff there was this bloke.     Im not sure what you would call him.Weirdo,Preacher....insane loony.....but he was shouting at the top of his voice 'You have ten minutes to live!'.     I suppose this was his idea of causing panic....     But it does make you wonder, what would you do if you had only ten minutes left on this crappy little planet of ours?        4 hours or more of shopping later we headed back to get the train (and by 'we' i mean moi and my muther who seemed quite generous today).     Now my French is really terrible and most people should know that.My teachers obviously didnt as they kept me in top class and then gave me a rubbish report last year, which i think is rather rude .    'Lauren will not achieve a GCSE in French if her attitude remains unfocused' (or something along those lines).Why the hell put me in that class then!God dam them........     Anyhoo, on the train there was this group of Frenchies and i managed to work out what they were saying...which is quite an achievment for moi.     Well at least i think they were talking about a long....house........something about a...erm....dog maybe.....ummmm     Maybe not.     Nevermind.        Blimey, if i carry on writing i will have myself a novel.     I'd better go and rest my weary feet now.          Goodbyb.             Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
