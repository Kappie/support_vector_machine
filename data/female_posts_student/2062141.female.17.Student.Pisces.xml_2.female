I don't know who it's by, it's on a mix I have. If you were here with me I'd sing it for you.   ***************  Sometimes I think no one knows me. Like really knows me. Like each person knows a different side of me that the others don't. I guess everyone's like that. But does any one person know all my sides? I don't think they do. Or sometimes, I'll be thinking they know me so well then they'll go say something like "oh but you don't like that" or "you wouldn't like that" .... and I'll just think... "how could they think that about me? don't they know me at all?" sounds dumb... it's hard to explain... i don't know. It's like that song The Stranger by Billy Joel. I think I posted the lyrics on here a ways back. Anyways I was just thinking about that because I just had a fight with my mom. She doesn't know me hardly at all. She knows that one side of me. Actually, it's that horrible side of me that I hate, that isn't me at all. That side of me that's like, rebellious and mean. Which is weird because I'm not at all like that. But they would never believe that because that's how they see me. It's extremely frustrating. You know what, I just wrote a paragraph all about my family and shit but I just erased it. It's very complicated and you guys wouldn't understand, because you don't know that side of me, or of my family. Makes me wonder what really is me.... not that I need one side to define me. A person is incredibly multi-faceted... Well, I'm the happiest and most content when I'm with my closest friends. Then again that's why they're my closest friends.  I was thinking about this the other day too. I'm a compulsive liar. I just all a sudden realized that. I'm very good at lying, which is how it started. Don't worry, I don't lie to you guys. But to my parents. It's gotten pretty bad. I gotta stop. But then, of course, my worst flaw is my procrastination. It's funny, that word is just giving a name to something to make it sound like it's some sort of disease that you can't help. "I'm not lazy, I'm a procrastinator! I gotta problem!" But that's the trouble with procrastinators... they know exactly what they should be doing. And they're not lazy, they just do stuff instead of doing stuff they HAVE to do. I'm not sure how to explain it, but I know I am one. And I know how to stop. Eh, I'll stop tomorrow.
