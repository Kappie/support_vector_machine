I had a strange experience with my old stalker Brian and one of his friends. They were staring at me through the door while I was in class. I turned around and saw them, and they were just focused on me, and they waved. It was freaky. I bombed a math quiz. That sucks. I have homework I should be doing soon. Ick. I need to stop slacking off.
