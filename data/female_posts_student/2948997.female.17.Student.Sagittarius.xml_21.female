This has been an awesome oppurninity to connect and establish friendships. There are a couple people here at Encounters that remind me of people from back home:  Jeremy: A major liberal supporter and plans on becoming PM one day, all he does is talk politics, and he debates with the facist which is very interesting to watch. This kid reminds me so much of our dear Alan, who would be proud at the liberal representation here in Ottawa...and by the way...there is a kid here who looks exactly like Alan. It seems that I've been followed...  The Facist: This kid is wack. Hello?! Did anyone hear that facisism...is  Dead? *Gasp* Anyways, this kid and the liberal are fun to watch combat each other.  The E-feminate boys: the ones who you question...the ones who make you just tilt your head and ponder...are they, or aren't they. It doesn't matter...I'll let them correct me.  Alright, so I had some serious fun adventures yesterday:  I went shopping in this marketplace, free of tax to support our artisans and now I come home with a new purse, a beenie hat, a buddha, a princess box, a couple of rings, and an assortment of other fun interesting stuff. I figure, I saved cash for nothing in particular so I've spent a good chunk.  I saw this belt yesterday with a chainsaw and I thought of Jamie...and his sick obbession with the TCM (TexChainMass). I didn't buy it...too damn expensive and we're going for sushi when I get home again...this time there will not be 104 spent.  Oh! So, I've travelled overseas twice in the last two days...I've been to Japan and to India. Thats right folks, it makes me proud to say that I've been to the High Commission and the Embassy. It bothers me that the Americans have an entire block dedicated to their HUGE embassy...which is full of CIA agents who read other peoples mail. Oh shit. They are probably reading this as we speak ******transmittion CUT*********** ******RESUME**************  It's 5:36 in the morning Ontario time..so thats 4:36 Manitoba time. It's early and I'm getting slighty sleepy. When I get back in to the city, it's time to shower and start studying along with call work and find out the damn schedule. Ah hah! An entire week off work...and come May long weekend, we're going to Westerns...another plane. Hells yes!  And By the way...Paul, I have dibbs near you...if I can get it.  I encourage any of you that are still under 18 to grasp this opporunity and seize with vigour. If your over 18, too bad *laughs* (no, sorry)... You can all see my pictures when I get them developed....  And...I'm still alone. There are people here who "met the love of their lives" and become a couple. I know I'm not the only person who realizes this doesn't work because it seems that the couple is made of people from different ends of the country. PEI dates BC... does that work? NO  And...I'm making cabinet of the HoC...it's the goal.   Alright... I had a fabolous time...spend some time with me and I'll tell you some amazing stories.  I missed you all....  and I can swear in french...  always
