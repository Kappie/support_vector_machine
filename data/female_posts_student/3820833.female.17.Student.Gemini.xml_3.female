Pre-marital sex is getting more and more common in our society nowadays. People used to make it a sign to symbolize the loves to his/her partner or to represent the trust that lies between he and his partner. But, are we 100% guarantee that he/she is our life partner? If unwanted pregnancy occurs, will they responsible to it? Besides, if unluckily the “he” is still a teenager who does not have the ability to make a living, how could he responsible to the unexpected matter?   Secondly, I do agree with my teacher who implied the dangers that we would be exposed to when we have pre-marital sex. The main danger we will face was the infection of the AIDS. We do not know whether our partner is one of the HIV-carrier. For me, I definitely would not risk myself to such a danger that will affect my whole life. What’s more, unwanted pregnancy might be happened too. People are saying that they are having safety-sex. However, I do not want to elaborate on it anymore, It’s just scary to imagine that a teenager was pregnant and she has to stop her study just because of the accident. It’s really frightening.   I strongly agree with another teacher of mine who remind us that loves can’t be represent by anything, especially sex. True love does not need anything to signify the sincerity or to prove the trustworthiness between the couple. I believe that whoever who asks for sex so that his/her partner’s love is signify is definitely not the one who treats the relationship sincerely and seriously. Don’t you agree with it?   P/s: You are welcome to voice your opinion here.
