Miss Low began her humanities lesson at 7 in the morning and as usual, it was filled with laughter and her interesting experiences (when she lived in a kampong in M'sia) kept me awake.   NPCC training was a bang. I looove trainings, it makes me feel so disciplined and proud (of my CCA). We did some basic drills and Sir Kiwi informed us that he and the other CIs and ICs would access us for our promo test based on today's performance. Jess (Pui Yoke) and I were the flag bearers so compared to my other mates who were carrying the rifle, we were mucho luckier. So we just practiced marching in and out again and again and again, from 8am+ to 12pm+ with all the other uniform groups. At one point, Mr Lee pretended to be the Guest of Honour and everyone cheered for him. Haha. He is an incredibly nice teacher. :)   After which, Val, Xiong, Edwyn, Yati, Jess and I wenta' Seoul Garden at JP to celebrate Edwyn's birthday. Laugh until I almost vomitted. *Teehee* :P We met Beng and his GF and we all gathered near the MRT station to chat for about an hour or less, then went home, beat. Hehe. It was a rather tiring day, cos after the other uniform groups have been dismissed, we still had to change to our full U for the continuation of the our promotion test. Good luck to everyone when the results are out! " Endure !"
