But anyways.... Yeah so welcome to the most miserable week of my life... I had all my wisdom teeth removed and one of my molars, and now my face is all puffy and my mouth is so swollen I haven't been able to eat normal food for 4 days.... Well there are other reasons I'm upset but I don't need to bore you with the details of that because those who know already know. And I've been holed up in my room watching movies on my bed and I am going crazy. I feel like such crap. And I don't want to leave the house or do anything but I don't want to be HERE. And I go to camp on Sunday. Which I love. But when I'm feeling this shitty it's hard to imagine I'll be having fun in a matter of days.
