I think it explains a lot   11/2/2003  I'm BACK!: your mindset your thinking.... you tear yourself apart Lizard: b/c i don't know what I am... I don't know what i stand for, how i see things, what i want, or what i don't want. I want to be independent, i don't want to have to rely on ppl... yet i crave someone to take care of me.. i don't want things to bother me, but i can't let things go until they've already cut me... i have too much faith in small people... i love idleness but i hate feeling worthless    I'm BACK!:  sounds like you've got a lot figured out about yourself already  Lizard :  maybe... but i don't understand it, i just recognize it  Lizard:  i love myself but i hate myself too... same with everyone else.. i can't stand someone but i can't bare to see them go, i'm angry but i'm sad, i'm happy but i'm not... i'm nothing but a mix of emotions... they contradict themselves and make no sense... the only thing that I know... that stays the same through out... is that i want to be a better person a better friend,... THE best that I can  Lizard : but that all those different, contradicting feelings... make it so complicated  Lizard:  i need to go to sleep  I'm BACK!: agreed   I'm BACK!: concurrable  I'm BACK!:  you should sleep more and think less.... because you think so much you put yourself in vicious think cycles and make you go bananazaas.
