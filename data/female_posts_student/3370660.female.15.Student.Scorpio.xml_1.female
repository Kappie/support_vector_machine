I just don't know anything. All this time was in preparence for this- for finding this whole endevour was a "sincere attempt" on his part, and I wasn't an experiment. And for saying goodbye, in advance.  Something is coming, drastic changes are bound to happen. He gave me a taste of the future, but no deffinate plans to come.  In a few months everything he said will make sense, in a few months nothing will make sense.  I hate being in the middle of this- of knowing nothing is certain and anything could be true.  alone we stand together we fall apart   Current music:  The end has no end | The Strokes {in other news- i rather like this song}
