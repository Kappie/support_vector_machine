It was so much nicer than sitting in classrooms all day. Yeah, that's about it...woo...I love peace project, Amethyst and I are working on a rape recovery scene, I typed up an idea for the dialogue, i'm so proud :)  and maybe if you want to read it i'll let you, I'm so proud, I'm not a good writer...but I love what i've just written.  Today was wonderful.  But I have to return to school tomorrow eh. Ah well...because I am in a good mood.  Go hiking, and then go to peace...it will cheer you up a bit.
