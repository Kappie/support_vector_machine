What I do with my present life will result to what could happen in the future. But, there are times when I believe that everything happened because it’s already been written somewhere. Still, I wonder what that book could be and where does it rests?   Lately, things have not been favorable to me. I haven’t done anything that could jeopardize the one thing I am careful of, but, it seems like I’m heading to another catastrophe. You know, this “gut” feeling some people talk about, is really true. No matter how hard I try to deny it, there’s just something scary about “gut” feeling, because it really blows you hard.   I know I tend to self-destruct, but, I’ve done nothing. I mean, maybe before, I lost my chances in happiness because I self-destruct, but, what happened now? I wonder. Were all these, just trials to test me out, on how strong I can get, or how tough am I even when “the wind howls”.   Come on…help me out here. Don’t leave me in the dark! Confess all! I am tired of assuming and presuming…just come out clean and be honest. I may have been a lot of things, but I don’t think I deserve this. I won’t beg you. All I ask is your honesty.
