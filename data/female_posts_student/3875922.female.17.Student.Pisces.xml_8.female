FUCK.   i couldnt feel it until later, but..... my god.....jonathan started feeling it when we were sitting down in the eating area bench place in camden...bu i felt it whenwe got to shepherds bush green. and when i got home.... oh my god. i was completely fucked. in a good way. giggle giggle, smiley smiley. all was good. THEN my mum got back.shit shit shit. it was such a tricky moment. - a long moment really.i think i had to be in her company for about 1 hour and a half before i had to say that i was feeling "ill" and had to go to bed, which is where i am now. i still cant coherently put together a sentence, without sounding like an infant, which i cant do even when im sober, but its getting better.   i think my "fuck me" shoes are too overlywhorish.... shit....im such a bloody slapper wanna be.... i actually want a corset though.... i think they're quite kinky  anyway. i'd better shut up   xxxk
