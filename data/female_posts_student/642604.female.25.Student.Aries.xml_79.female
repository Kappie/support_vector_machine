The bitch is in the office and giving me the runaround ON MY LAST FRICKIN WEEK! As if I have any clue as to what the other people in charge of shows I DON'T WORK ON are doing... COME ON! Now I have to investigate all this crap that I have no clue about and people are tired of answering my redundant questions because they are all like can't this wait till next week when the others are back? Well one would think so since those shows are far off. But no, the woman who is in the damn office for a total of five hours a week and has NO FUCKING CLUE as to what goes on in this office feels the need to stick her nose in and tell us all what to do. I AM SO GLAD THIS IS MY LAST WEEK!
