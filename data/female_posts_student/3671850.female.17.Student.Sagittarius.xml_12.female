FRIDAY:  Jessica, Nikol, Chad and I went to eat japanese fast food and saw Princess Diaries 2.  The movie was good, a little corny, but then again it is G rated.  We also went to Applebees to see Sarah and watched Earth Girls are Easy at Chad's.  They're Aliens!!!!  ANNNNYWAY friday was fun.  I don't think I can handle many more  Friday the 13ths ... Jessica hated me all day... sry :( muahhh.  SATURDAY:  The crew went out again, well just to Chad's to watch Kill Bill vol 1  2.... muy bien...clase repita, muy bien... okay i tried.  We ate pizza and oreos.   *Note: my apoligies for making ANYONE uncomfortable, I am still in recovery. It won't happen again, pinky promise... and I keep my pinky promises... ahem....*   We later got in the hot tub and Jessica and I (the brave ones) jumped in the pool (while reinacting the scene from Titanic... it was lots of fun).  SUNDAY:  I went to church, ate at Smithfield's with mom, came home, attempted hw, and back to church.  After church (which was very good, i might add) Jess and Kol and I went to Joe's for some  Ice Cream, Ice Cream .. lol.  And now... here I sit... alone in my room... sigh.  Thats okay, I'll get over it.  I love my friends.. and I just know I'm gonna miss them sooooo bad... I wish I could just stop time right here... with Jess, Kol, Chad and Sarah... :(   Song of the day:  Cannon ball , of course.
