So if that isn't dramatic enough for you.... it gets better -major sarcasm- I look around myself and, I like where I am, I like who I've become, I like where I'm going, I like the freedom......  I don't like the fact that my Mom isn't here to see me. I don't like the fact that Michael won't arrive on my doorstep with roses to whisk me away to the Banquet like we always planned. I miss them. I've been in tears all afternoon...  I'm going to go do my makeup and put on my dress and start crying all over again..... as Dad said after I 'recieved' my diploma.... "My God, We Survived.".... 6 years ago I didn't think I would.... Hell.. 1 year ago it seemed impossible.  And here is where I'd like to put my formal thank you. My thanks to everyone, all my friends who have supported me through my problems, those of You I've known forever, and those of You more recent, all Your love and support has made this possible, and while it sounds absolutely ridiculous considering we've never met - most of all to Kris and Kelsey. Thank You to everyone.  Okay... back to crying...
