Oh well. there've been quite a  few opportunities for me to roam outside (I had to walk to a nearby hospital a  few times to take pictures of doctors). But it was rather foolish to eat  lunch at my desk. but I've not yet had 30 minutes in a row to eat it, so  I'm eating it slowly over several hours.              Ernie's been such a nice dog lately. A bit spazzy, but nice  nonetheless. Tonight he gets to run around the yard for a long, long  time.              I have been on a picture taking kick lately. It really makes  me happy to take pictures of people (I'm a huge fan of skies, but otherwise, not  too interested in landscapes) and I love taking candid pictures of people doing  things that they love, because their passion is so evident on film. Ann,  my boss/friend thinks I'm A Photographer. Which makes me feel  weird.              Okay I'm getting slammed at work, I have to  go.
