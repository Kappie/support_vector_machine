I don't believe that I evolved from an ape or that there was a little spec of dust that exploded and bam there are the planets. Oh and it just so happens that instead of there being life on all of them its just on the one but still from the same speck of dust. If that were the case then there would be life on all the planets not just one. As for evolving from an ape. Where are all the half apes. They wouldn't just disappear or anything. And being that it would have to occur over a long period of time it would be reasonable for someone to argue that we are all that's left but it would be decimated or we would find proof. I mean we have all this stuff about dinosaurs altogether IM not sure if I believe that they existed either. So we have the skeletons. You know since things can evolve and all maybe we just had some really big big ( I was going to say something else) elephants or something and the scientist but the skeleton together wrong.  I believe the whole bible theory. God made the world in 7 days. And was lonely and made us plus we got to name the animals. Oh yeah buddy. True reason for our being to serve and be with God. And truly that doesn't make sense either. He could make the world and us but where did he come from. Easier said for some then others. He was just there. But every thing ash a beginning and an end. God doesn't? It makes no sense. A couple of days ago in class you said that in some cultures life lines are a straight line and some where circles. Well my life line is neither as well as Gods. Mine is a ray. I was born and that was the starting point ant it will continue forever, weather in heaven or hell. @-----------------------> that's my life line right there. Continues for all eternity. They arrow showing when my time ends on earth. I guess IM saying that if a culture can have a life line that is a circle then why can there not be a God. If someone can die and come back something else ,and I don't believe that's possible either but what the hey, then who is to say god does not exist.     Gods life line will, it will last forever. It will be there when we aren't.    that's gods life line and the closest I can come to find how I define philosophy       1:26 PM Wednesday, January 14, 2004 Im sitting in class waiting for the 12:10 bell to ring. Its 12:05 now. If you get out of class just on time slipping thought the crowed of people in the hall then you might have time to eat your whole meal. 12:07 our lecture finally ends. Three minutes and the blue hall will be filled with people. Three and a half minutes and the commons will be invaded by students pushing and shoving. Slipping through the door pass whoever is checking the ID's today (because they don't have theirs)trying to get in line. The bell rings and just as I described it everything falls into place, everyday it never fails. I hurry to the lunch line and reach in my pocket. I pull out my ID, I remembered it today. Then to decide what you want to eat. I always pick chicken. The wait is long. It seams like the line goes on forever in front of me, I look back and am thankful that I made it so close to the front this time. I step forward. Again and again till I reach the front and pay for my food. I hurry to the lunch table where I now sit with my boyfriend. Everyone is already sitting. No one there eats except me and another girl, I have yet to learn her name. All the others have early release. They sit around ant talk and I listen to them. The words slipping through there lips, I don't catch everything, and never talk. I also watch people as they steal chairs from others as they sit in them. Many people stand. By third lunch I am very hungry and need to check with Mrs. Blunt about the art show. I eat the chicken piece by piece but chew quickly. My jaws move up and down. Teeth grinding against either the meat of themselves. I that's a quick drink of water. The wetness in my mouth is stewing but there is no time to enjoy it. I decide I am finished. And give away about half my lunch, keeping the water. I walk with speed down the hall to room 505. Talk to miss blunt and the bell sounds. I jump at the sharp ring of it still speaks but I have to cut her short being that my class is on the other side of the school. I yet again hurry thought the halls back to my class to make it there within the five minutes that I no longer have. I always make it.
