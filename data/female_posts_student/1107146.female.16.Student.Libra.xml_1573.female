You should have seen me trying to drive in Nashville today...it's a really good thing I have a gun. It's amazing that Abby's parents trust me so much...heheh, ok I'm not that bad but still. Dumb people anger me.  So cool...I'm pretty much recovered, give or take my throat which still hurts a little...nothing some drugs can't help. Again, whenever thou all wanteth to partaketh in said event, I shalt await ye.
