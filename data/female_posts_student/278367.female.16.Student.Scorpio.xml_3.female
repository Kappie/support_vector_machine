The writing is full of wit and dry humor, chacteristic of Jane Austen's style.  The language is in the style of that age (late 1700s, early 1800s), of course, but it is not hard to read.  I say this because many are scared away by books that use an older style of language.    The story centers around our heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, and mainly around her interactions with her family and a man named Mr. Darcy.  The narrator tells the story from the views of Miss Bennet so the reader is as mistaken by first impressions as she is.  As one reads through the book, the reader comes to new revelations about Mr. Darcy's character, whether mistaken or true.  Full of charm, Austen also pokes fun at the different types of people of that era -- the proud, rich elite, the wreckless soldiers, the simple "country folk" -- but one finds them all both endearing and amusing, despite their flaws.    This was Jane Austen's first written book, although it was not published until the early 1800s.  I would say this is my favorite of her many (Sense  Sensibility, Emma, Persuasion, et al).  For those looking to get more of a feel of the story through a movie, I would recommend the  urlLink BBC/A version  because it seems to be the one that captures the spirit of the book best.  It also is, in my opinion, closest to the book.  It is, however, about 3-4 hours since it was first aired as a mini-series.
