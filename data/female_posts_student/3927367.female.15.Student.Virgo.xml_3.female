Or not.... We've run into a million problems, not to mention my family is being stupid about it. That and I have only gotten about 7 hours of sleep since waking up on Monday morning. That's an average of about 3.5 hours of sleep a night. It is messed up! Oh well, I'm thriving I guess. So, my parents pretty much hate me right now because painting is taking so long, and my little siblings aren't handling the change very well or whatever. It's all retarded crap. Moving on, tomorrow my family is having a family portrait done, then we come home, I get to work on the drums for about 2 hours, and then hopefully I'll get to go to my boyfriends house and watch band of brother, or at least part of it. Then on Friday I'm leaving with one of my best friends and we are going to the ocean. Newport to be exact. I've never seen then ocean in my life!!! I am so excited. Well, I got to get back in the garage. Some of the drummers make me nervous. Laterz.
