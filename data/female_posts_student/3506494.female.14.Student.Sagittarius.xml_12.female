I noticed Bruce had made some Life Goals and since that's way too cool, I couldn't have him showing me up, no could I?! Haha, so I made some of my own  better  Life Goals. =P  - Be accepted into an Ivy League school - Maintain at least a 3.8 GPA throughout High School - Keep in touch with a large majority of my friends from Jr. High/High School throughout my life. - Learn HTML - Finally learn the guitar.  - Become fluent in another language, preferably Latin, French, or Japanese - Visit Italy, France, Japan, and London at least once. - Publish a book - Kiss in the rain. (=D)  Heehee, Bruce seemed to like them. ^_^  Hush T3h Silent (5:25:48 PM): My life goals >>> Yours Hush T3h Silent (5:25:49 PM): ^_^ WheresMyFangirl (5:25:57 PM): PSH WheresMyFangirl (5:25:57 PM): whatev WheresMyFangirl (5:25:59 PM): lol WheresMyFangirl (5:26:06 PM): i like that kiss in the rain one.
