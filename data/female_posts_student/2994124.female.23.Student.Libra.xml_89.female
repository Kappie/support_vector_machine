This might be ok, or even good, if coming from a young, handsome, trendy man but the GP is like in his late 50s and probably wears slippers and knitted wooly jumpers at home! Must make mental note to listen to young, hip-hop and happening station tomorrow! Yeah right.  At Navs last night ruth had to organise this meditation thing on the things God's given us. She had found some verses and wanted people to sit and 'meditate' on them, but I suggested that perhaps not everyone could just sit there and ponder a verse for a whole 15 mins, and that diff people find different ways more helpful. So we had an art area; a soft cushioned area for people just to chill in; lots of paper and pens for people to write the verse out in their own words or to write a letter to God, or just to note their thoughts, and then tons of candles! It was great. Well I found it really helpful anyway, and it was nice to be able to get invovled in organising something.  Back to the working world.....
