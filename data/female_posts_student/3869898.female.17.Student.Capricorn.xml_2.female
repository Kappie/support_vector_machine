I fell 4 times nut it was fine...I had to stunt with a girl i didn't really like and she kept naggign at me about eveything..but whatever...i didn't kick he in the head and she didn't drop me..so o well...I just hope for a diffrent base next time! My body hurts again...sore and now i feel like i need to go work out today!  Ok so let's see I joined the thing on myspace..it is so crazy..like a million new people and i can not even keep track of them...dirty old men..horney lil boys...and guys who think that just cause they say i am beautiful they are going to get laided!! I dunno....well i mean i guess it is a good palce to meet new people! And the boy...oh he made out with the dirty whore...and ok i am over it...he was a lying lil boy anyway and will one day realise he let the best thing go that he will ever have...but high school love never lasts..boys just care about their little head....and are lacking an important organ..a heart..o well pish posh!! Ha ha BOO!! over done wiht can't change the mistakes in the past just got to learn not to make them again! No news on my grandpa...still just waiting..then i wonder is worse knowin someone is going to die or for them just to die?? Well i can tell you both hurt a hell of lot...and all i cna wish for is the best...he stays with us happliy..for as long as he can.... until later
