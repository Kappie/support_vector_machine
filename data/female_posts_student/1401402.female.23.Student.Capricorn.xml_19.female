For the last five years I've tune in to channel 20 the WB, every wednesday night at 8 o'clock just to watch this show. Friends was teasting me for some reasons. So what if I like a teen soap. I have a total concept potential you wouldnt understand. I've waist so much time in a bubble. This show puts me in a very emotional position. I'm just so touched rite now. :)  I was pretty thrill with the ending. The love triangle waves became a square. Dawson (James Van Der Beer) was so perfect for Joel (Katie Homes). They were soulmate. At the ending Joel choose Pacey. I was alil disappointed but it was a happy ending. I cant be sad over this but its just perfect.   Love Love is a concept that everybody goes through. Why? I dont know! I wish that I've never fall for people I'm so attached to but some how it just developes. I cant stop myself and I dont know how. The only way is for that person to hurt me really bad in a cruel cruel way as much as possible. Sure I'll be hurt along the way but it WORKS. Love is so short and forgetting is eternity. Jumping in with your heart and jumping out with your head. Jumping in and out isnt wise. Making decision with yourself is difficult. But just be honest and be true to yourself. Its hard, who am I kidding? If decision are made dont look back. Dont run away from yourself either. We're in this fancy world discovering life itself. Sometimes I asked myself "What the hell am I doing?". Life isnt perfect, nobody is. The value of time is what counts the most. Is it or isnt it? Mistakes were made. Be sure to make mistakes, makes lots of them. Because there is no better way to learn. Love to the tip of your fingers. Who ever you choose dont run away from it. Dont chase it either. It will come to you when you lease expect it. Just be patience.   Friendship can never be over estimated. Forgive and forget thats all I can really say.  Belief I believed that god put us here for a reason. But how many of you believed in god??? I personaly dont even think god exist. But I do believed in Buddhism because their there for me to feel, see and capable of many things. Everybody should believe in something rite?    Birth is the opposite of Death. Life is the opposite of nothing. Doesnt matter who ends up with who. Just as long as your happy rite? Rite.  Dreams Everybody's dream car would be, benz, h2, navi, anything expensive that flashes people eyeball to open wide. Dream bike would be, yamaha, sasuki, honda, etc, dont they all realized thats the most dangerious shit to be on??? I dont want all of that. No way...my shit has to be a private JET. Yep yep yep, while everybody's going crusin, being stuck in traffic, I'm flying high in the sky. Looking down and the best part of all, I can sit and enjoy my ice cream :).
