There was this hawt guy at the park, his name was Billy. He was really cool, up himself a bit and he said I talk to much!! I know, what the fuck is he on about!? At night I only went out for a bit, saw Paul, Sarah, Roslyn, Steven and Stuart, just briefly, I got annoyed cause I found out that Paul used to "like" Sarah, I think he realised I was mad...maybe cause I locked him out his house and forced him to walk me home :)  I went home and went on msn, I managed to convince a guy from Canada that I met on BenFolds.org to call me, it was fun. I'm totally playing him cause he's a prick. Then I went to my Dad's house and stayed there. My parents have been divorced, well at least seperated since I was about four, it doesn't bother me. My mum said the only thing I was concerned about was wether or not i would be allowed to take the rabbit to my dad's house ( i was, score) . Anyways, I stayed there. Called Chris and we were talking for ages :) aw, I love the guy. We watched tv together basically, it was fun! Then I felt I should call Paul. So I did, yeah it was cool, but I was too tired to be bothered. So i fell asleep. I'll post about today later on tonight. Peace and Empathy Love and Huggles, Rhona xxx
