Dad called and told us that if we didn't do all of our points then we would be grounded, I haven't done much so I guess I will be. I have been working on a wiring harness, except when the emchanic took it out of the car it belonged in, he accidentaly cut an important part off so the whole thing is just one big mess, not to mention, my dad doesn't have the correct book information for this harness so none of the wire colors are what their supposed to be and everything is really confusing. Our friends who are staying at the campground didn't stop by at all today. Usually they come over and are out on the lake all day, but they didn't make an appearance. Maybe that's because it was raining all day. At the moment, there is a little sun shining on the lake but there is probably just a hole in the cloud because everywhere else looks shitty.
