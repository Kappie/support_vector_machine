I was going to stay in SC because I wasn't ready to make a commitment to settle down just yet. I didn't want to say i was going to stay here in NC unless I was totally sure I would stick to it. There are three big reasons for this, and they are my adopted little bros and sis. These kids range formt he age 9-13, and I am really close to them. They would be mega upset if I said I would stay them left because I've already donw that a few times in the past.  I came up to NC, intially, because Gayle needed me to watch the kids while she went to florida to pick up a cadilac she bought. The week went great, and I was starting to think maybe I shouldn't leave.  Things in SC are different. If you read just a little through my blog, you can see that for yourself. I really want Sky to have a nice life. I really do.  I decided to stay.  And so I am here, still, a couple of months later.  I have rededicated my life to God, and I am actually INTERESTED in learning about the Bible. I'm reading this awesome book right now called learn the Bible in 24 hours. (you actually learn through 24 chapters in hour increments)It sounds boring, I know, but it really isn't.   There are so many things I didn't notice in reading the Bible in my past. The guy that wrote the book has mad insight into what the Bible is actually saying. I'm halfway through the book.  Anyway, so now you are caught up so I can begin blogging again!
