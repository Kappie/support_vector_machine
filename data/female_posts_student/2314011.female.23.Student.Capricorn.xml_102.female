I thought as I passed three police cars parked near the said-tenant housing complex shortly after my turn onto Levick street, headed to my building after a less-than-enchanting visit to the movies.    But the two police officers walking up the stairs and into the hallway leading to my apartment made me wonder what was really going on.  Were my neighbors embroiled in a brawl?  Did I have terrorists living next door?  Was I going to see an actual police-performed eviction?  Repossession of illicit or unpaid-for property?  My excitement waned when I realized they could be headed to my apartment as easily as they could be after my neighbors.  As evidenced in the last few posts, a certain anniversary had been weighing heavily on my mind the last few days, which was the last time a police officer had visited my humble abode.  The coincidence was a tad unnerving.    So was finding two officers standing at my door when I entered the hallway.    "Can we talk to you for a second?" one said, with nary a smile or formal introduction.    "About what?"  I asked, threading myself between the two blocks of men to protect my vulnerable front (and only) door.  "Who lives here?"    "I do."  I answered, trying to remember if I'd put my bags of green vegetable matter away and locked the cage in my bathtub holding the kidnapped young heiress to a Greek fortune.  "Anyone else in there?"  Again, like we know each other.  "No; I live alone."  "Well, we received a report that crying and yelling was coming from this apartment."  "Oh thank god!  You boys really had me scared there for a minute!  That's just the ghost of an Asian maid who visits me.  She doesn't actually  live    here, see.  She doesn't like it when I see movies without her.  But when I tell her how bad this one was, she'll quiet down, I promise."  "Can we take a look inside just to make sure?"  I thought for a second about refusing; after all, I'd spent a month writing a memo in support of a motion to suppress tangible evidence acquired as a result of an illegal police entry.  But, if the ghost really had been throwing a fit loud enough for the cops to be called by a neighbor (I'm choosing to believe she didn't call them herself, which she's threatened to do on occasion), she may have also let loose the Greek heiress, who's a bit of a hassle to deal with once the gag is removed, in which case, I'd like a bit of police protection.    "Sure," I said.    They stayed in the hallway while I took the first few steps in and looks around to make sure everything was safe for human consumption.  Once I was confident the ladies hadn't betrayed me, the police asked once more: "Can we come in?"  "Oh sure!  They're...I mean, SHE's fine; doesn't seem like she's here anymore.  It's cool."  And, seeing as the situation was under control and I was clearly alone with my demons, they departed, still having never introduced themselves, the inconsiderate pricks.
