Let me tell ya, they will fight until their eyes are all red and practically closed.  Anyway, I am watching the Iron Chef.  Ed and I love watching this show.  I would love for ne day to be able to cook like these people.  You know, to just be able to whip something up together without having some recipe to consult.  Oh that would be wonderful.  Although most of the things I do cook now wasn't through some recipe book, but from just throwing things together and well they aren't as bad as I make them out to be...MOST OF THE TIME!  I was a little sad today.  Depressed, more like it.  The baby would have been close to being here...if not here by now.  =*(  I know that everything happens for a reason.  I would like to have one more child.  People are going to read this and laugh, but I think that when I have a stable job I wouldn't mind having more children.  I don't want to sound like that si all I want in life, it isn't.  I just love children and I love watching them grow.  I also knwo that my parents love children adn have loved being grandparents.  I think my kids have kept my mom fighting and allowed her not to give up on life.  I am happy to be able to give her that.  Plus my children are the reasons why I am who I am today.  They have each taught me a strength that I don't know if anyone else could have taught me.  I love those kids.  I was thinking today how lucky I am to have Ed.  I love Ed.  He is such a wonderfula dn loving husband...so he isn't as romantic as when we were dating, but he loves comepletely and with his whole heart, not only to me, but to my entire family.  WE are so fortunate to ahve him in our lives.  My dad evens sees him as a son and not a son-in-law.  I am starting to feel that with my mother-in-law.  We will be up in the Bay area next weekend for Ed's brother's graduation.  I am excited to go up there, it has been a couple of years since we last went up there.  It should be nice.  Ed was telling me the other day about his brother's prom.  It is funny how things change.  We also learned of his college plans to stay up in northern California.  I feel bad for Ed, he was really looking forward to his brother moving down.  He really misses his siblings.  I feel for him.  I know that I would be lost without my sisters, no matter how batty they may drive me.  I love them and they complete my life.  Well anyway, I think that this is where I should end things.  LOL  I am so sorry to go on and on...I just had some time to write and well, I took it and ran with it.
