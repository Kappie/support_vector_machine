I really feel like I've recovered and it feels overwhelming but at the same time, absolutely great. I remember back in January actually feeling scared of living without an eating disorder; as if it was part of me and no matter how much I wanted to let it go, at the same time I wanted it to stay with me. I've overcomed that though and despite a couple setbacks, I'm really doingwell.        What's also great is I actually enjoy eating again. I remember about two summers ago,I was counting all my calories, watching everything I ate, recording all my exercising and weighing myself like 15 timesa day. I was obsessed with it. Now, I weigh myself maybe once every couple months out of curiosity and I just eat when I feel like it and what I want... just in moderation of course. I never thought I'd EVER get here but I am. Oh man. =)        I love going to the gym in the evening. It's more peaceful at night compared to the morning when everybody seems to go. I like the atmosphere better at night. You know what though? If you asked me last year if I was a night or day person, I would say a day person without a doubt. Now, for sure, I'm a night person. Although, I can handle both if I must... like now, since I'm working.        I do have a point... and now I'll get to it. I was looking through a photo album today of my aunt's wedding back in 1980. She hasn't changed! She never changes one bit... physically I mean.She's always had the same hairstyle, the same style of clothing, the same way she does her makeup, etc. Some of my close friends... who I've known for years, haven't changed either in my eyes. Whereas others most certainly have... and myself included. I change DRAMATICALLY each year. I'm not sure why exactly but it's just the way I am. I think I've come more into my own this year though... who knows what I'll be like next year but I'm pretty sure I won't change too much. It's because I can honestly say I like myself now. In previous years, there's always been something missing; a certain aspect of individuality maybe? Just certain things not exactly MISSING... just hadn't developed yet. I really feel like my own, strange person now.        Albums in Rotation:    Smashing Pumpkins'  Adore     Led Zeppelin's  IV     Pixies'  Surfer Rosa
