I didn't think they were going to be okay, and in a way I guess they weren't at times, but you can't have it all, I have to accept it like. Back tomorrow. Double header tomorrow night, I hope the practice went well last night. In a way I wish I could have been there. I don't like them, but you can't make the best of it if you can't come. I hope he got it. Probably. Either way I guess it doesn't matter that much. Very laid back. In fact,  too  laid back. I had fun today.  I fell down a lot today. Maybe it was one of those days. Maybe it was the sun. Maybe it was the jello shooters. Perhaps. lol Total face plant in the sand...very very  very  embarassing! Slipping in the boat, standing up and turning around? More so funny rather than embarassing. It's a falling day.
