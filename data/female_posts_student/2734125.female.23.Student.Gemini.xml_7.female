We were to ask a question for Reading and Writing Online Texts anyway, and that seemed like a question that was fairly relevant to my life.  In this blog I am going to try and approach this question.  I plan to look at the history of diaries a little bit, the histories of blogs a little bit, talk about what some other people are writing about this internet event, and then discuss if my experience in this medium matches those theories that have been proposed.    Before I dive into this let me first orient you to my online life a little bit.  I spend a fair amount of time online.  I don't think that it is over much, but likely more then I would admit to on a survey.  When I am in the lab, writing papers or doing research, and the internet is right there, just a link away (in the virtual world that I enter called "Computer Land"), well, I dash back and forth quite a bit.  I check my email, I look up movies, I search for random things on goggle and see what I can come up with (like "Duck Billed Goat" which got 9,150 hits) and just generally mess around.  I post to my blog, I check the chat boards that I have recently gotten into, I explore.  In my mind, and I would hazard to guess the minds of many others in the techno age, the language that I use to approach the internet is that of a virtual location.  I "visit" a site, I "explore", I "move"; I am traversing a world that is, in my language and mind, another reality.  This is a place where there are communities, personas, businesses, information, directions, sign posts, addresses, video feeds, made-up realms.  The internet, the world wide web, has the sci fi feel of so many movies that have pictured it.  I see bright blue highways that lead to miniature universes taking up megabytes rather then miles.  When I step through a link I am traveling into different plains, rooms, spaces created out of nothing.  It is strange to consider, stranger to live.    There were always computers around my house as a child, but they were for writing on and playing with the paint program.  We got internet when I was in high school.  I can't recall my first time online, but it must have been in grade school.  In high school I had email, that was checked rarely, and I occasionally went on live chat boards.  These boards, however, took time to be in.  I lacked the patients to sit around as a quite observer and get into the discussion, and so often just left to surf.  College shifted my online perspective, opening the internet to me through fast feeds and a school email account.  The internet began to take on body, began to gain weight in my reality as a world unto itself.  I am still not super computer literate.  This project (which will later involve some linking I think) will be the most technically inclined I have ever been.  (I was overjoyed when I began to play with the code of my blog to change the colors that appeared. I felt so in the know.  Thats how out of the loop I am.)   So, I think that it is important to stress, I am computer literate, but not computer savvy.  I can navigate the internet, know the basics about my computer, can create a blog, but could not construct a website yet, am not an "elite" hacker, and really just got on board this crazy internet ride.   My exploration of a blog is based on my own experience, my own attempt to understand this new "push button publishing for the people" (quote from old blog website... now missing from new site.  Damn fluid mediums.)What does this medium have to do with the way I write, the way I share my writing, or the way I write myself?  And if I'm curious, other people must be too... Maybe they'll find this page...
