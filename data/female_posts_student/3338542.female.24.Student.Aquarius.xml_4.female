I didn't really have anything with me to start a fire so I just perched myself further down the beach...  i laid down in the cold sand and looked up at the stars in the sky.   I wanted to walk down to the water... but i didnt.. I was afraid it would just bring on too much emotion.. one of the things i remembered was standing there kissing Isaiah and then... a wave came up and got us wet up to our ankles.. (it was like a scene out of a movie)   I got there and stayed on the sand.. and at this point i was so overwhelmed.. i got down on my knees and prayed.  I know at this point all that i have done makes it seem like i am the worst "christian" in the world.. I guess thats what happens when you start to fall away from God... But i prayed.. for all the pain to stop...(again) for Isaiah.. and then me if it was in his ultimate plan.. Iprayed for his family (even though they hate me).. i prayed for his life (future success).. i prayed for all his friends..(that they guide him through this tough time).. and i prayed for...... (i havent thought of names yet for the baby.. if there is one, but I am pretty sure.. they say that you just know...i think i just know..)  I must have been there for hours and hours.. because when i started driving back.. i could see the sky getting lighter from the sun getting ready to rise...  it dawned on me... I love him... (almost too much for my own good)... but God would take care of me because Isaiah wasn't... right??  Isaiah.. still has my necklace.. deep down inside.. i wish that he was just keeping it because a part of him that isn't being controlled by this growing hate.. still realizes that he loves me...  Ive never been so hurt by a break-up... maybe its because i know that Isaiah would never normally break-up over something like a misunderstanding (knock vs call) like this... i dont even know the most unstable of couples who would... thats why i know this isnt like him.. (its hard to remember that sometimes..when i am at the doctor's offices alone.)... i think id better run away soon.. as soon as i start to show... (i dont think praying will help how i feel about this...)
