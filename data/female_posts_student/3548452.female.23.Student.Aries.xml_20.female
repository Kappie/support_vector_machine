Anyhew, so all this stuff happens within the span of one day- kinda makes me wonder what i did to deserve all this at once. Friday continues in the wierdness. I'm confused, wondering what I'm going to say to David, because I think we have the potential to be something really great- only because we have such an open and honest friendship and I know that if he put his mind to it, he could be the kind of person I want to be with. He's already half way there.... Just need some nudges in the right direction. Friday morning though, I get really, REALLY pissed when I think about the whole situation with Rodney and his new bitch. See, most ppl know that I hate chat drama... but they dont know why. I've been chatting since I was 16 or 17, met quite a few chatters even way back then. I started chatting really heavy at 19 and I met most of the regulars that I know now. When I let people into my life, they got ammunition. Ammunition for what? To hurt me... I actually had some guy tell me he was God, and that he was sorry for giving my dad a heart attack and he'd try to not let it happen again. I had no idea who this guy was, he wouldnt tell me, but that's what made me want to keep my private life to myself. I will tell stuff now that I dont care about, maybe even tell some good things that have happened- and since I made this blog, I tell it all, but, I've grown up a lot. My thoughts and ideas are my own, and if somebody doesnt like it? I really could care less anymore. Well, when I was in school, I didnt really get into drama either, but if I didnt like you, nobody liked you. Period. I was that girl that everybody knew, but I wasnt in any crowd. I made my own. I was popular by association, an outcast by way of life, and a nerd by birth. I was part of every group and a lot of ppl loved me. Very few hated me and I made sure to be nice to everyone because I am totally empathetic. I put myself in their shoes all the time and I wouldn't want to not be loved, so I make it a point to love everybody. That's just me. At the same time, if you piss me off, I know myself. I am a bitch, very sneaky and manipulative, and I will get you if you cross me. Paybacks are a bitch- paybacks from me are a 7 foot tall amazon bodybuilding bitch. So, I dont like getting involved with chat drama because I dont like that side of myself. I try hard not to get in any mishaps with people I dont particularly care for- and that isnt many people at all. But, when somebody deliberately tries to get me caught in some drama (I dont know if they want to make themselves look or feel good by acting like they either a-are a really close friend, or b-are somebody I'd drool over) The evil side of me comes out and takes over and there's nothing I can do to stop it anymore. I used to be able to just let stuff go, but lately, when I get mad I get really really angry. I guess maybe I've just had enough of people walking all over me, who knows. But I think I got it covered now. And the wierdest horoscope just happened to get sent to me yesterday. With all the stuff with David, I have been so confused. My horoscope kind of coincided with the situation and let me know what I should do- which was wierd. It hasnt been wrong yet so.... *shrugs* My horoscope for Friday, July 23, 2004: "They arent asking for all that much. Think how grateful they will be if you go along." Wierd huh? Love, Me
