Does he think that I've been  trying  to let him occupy my thoughts? And how fucking trite is  that  line, as if I don't know what I deserve and want? He just keeps re-surfacing like a bad, difficult-to-kick habit.  Of course  there is someone better or someone more suited or whatever one calls this particular complementarity that we all seem to seek.  But sometimes it's about what you want and not about what you need. Sometimes what you want is not always what's best. Sometimes, you just wallow in the depths of despair before things go back to normal and life is good again. For me, life is already better - I've been processing this whole thing for a while. Unfortunately, I've let myself become lazy at the same time: I'm just waiting for things to happen - school, sex, sex, work, sex instead of laying clever plans, crafting evil deeds... In the meantime, my thoughts drift to those  urlLink O'Charley's  moments with the boy and its locus - you know, at the corner of good food and good times.  Hey, he used to think the joke was funny.
