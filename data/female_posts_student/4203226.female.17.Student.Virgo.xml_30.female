The best part is, we can all comment however much we want. We can pretty much do whatever we want with this thing - show pictures, link places - it's all good. I don't know whether or not you will like this idea, but it's worth the try!  How it works is each post will be shown separately and will be tagged by the person who wrote it, so it'll go "posted by krystal at X:00" or whatever and stuff.... if that makes sense!
