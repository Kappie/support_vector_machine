There was also a Slash solo somewhere in there....forgotten whereabouts that was (think it was just before Sweet Child O' Mine).  1. Nightrain 2. Its So Easy 3. Live And Let Die 4. Mr. Brownstone 5. Outta Get Me 6. Pretty Tied Up 7. Welcome To The Jungle 8. Civil War 9. Rocket Queen 10. Knockin' On Heavens Door 11. Sweet Child O' Mine 12. Paradise City  After the tribute - the band members got down from the stage. Matt and I shook hands with 'Axl' and 'Matt Sorum'. Yeah! Matt patted 'Izzy' on the back and gave him the thumbs up.  Ah yeah, another impressive thing to see was the fact that Slash had forgotten his glass slide to play the middle solo to Rocket Queen. Instead, Axl asked the crowd for an empty beer bottle....and so he used that instead :D.  Afterwards the DJ's played some good songs including: Alice Cooper - Poison Bon Jovi - You Give Love A Bad Name Metallica - Enter Sandman Radiohead -Ace Of Spades  I will be going next time of course :P.
