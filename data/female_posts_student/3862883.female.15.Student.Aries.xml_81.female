Durante's journey through the desert was described as a hellish experience, where he is beginning to suffer hallucinations.  When he came upon Tony's property, it was like finding a safe haven in the midts of hell.  The house represents sanctuary from the rest of the world (that being the desert), which is trying to kill him.  The author described Durante as being so happy to even see the windmill that it looked like a sacred item to him.  Just seeing the containers of water made his body break out in a sweat.  For Durante, just being fortunate enough to see this haven in the middle of the desert was like a holy man who finally reached Heaven after trying so hard to get there in the first place.
