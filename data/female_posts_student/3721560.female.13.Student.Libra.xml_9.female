I worse some pink chuck taylors and they were hurting my feet soe  I took them off and walked around barefoot. it was great! we stayed up till like 5 in the moournin. It was soe funny cause everyone was like," Doe u hear the brids?" and we were really hyper, but emily had to go to sleep cause she had to baby sit. Well thats all I wanna say except for I'm realy tired now. bye.
