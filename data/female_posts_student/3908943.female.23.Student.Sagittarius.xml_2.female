One of my friends (well actually most of them from school) love to give me grief about the incredibly dry sense of humor of the British. However, my little story below sounds more like something that my friends would try to do.      My cousin in England was getting married. At the beginning of the reception afterward, he friend handed keys out to about 20-30 females and 3 guys (this is all without my cousins knowledge). When it came to the part where he was supposed to give a speech about the newlyweds, he said that since my cousin was married now, all his 'girlfriends' had to turn in their keys to his house. So one by one these girls came up to the front and turned in their key in front of the married couple. At the end, the guys came up to. His bride didn't know what to think, probably something along the lines of, "what have I gotten myself into?" Too bad I couldn't have been there at the wedding though...      Well more stuff later
