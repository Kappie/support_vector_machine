I opened up the garage this morning to head off to work, and found my driver's side car door open.  Apparently, when I got home on Sunday night, I was so preoccupied with dragging stuff into the house that I just forgot about the door.  I didn't have anywhere to go on Monday, so my car just sat in the garage, door ajar, for a good 32 hours.  Needless to say, the battery was dead as dead can be.  So I called work, and I know I've already said this, but I'm so lucky to have the friends I do.  Britt from work came over, jumper cables in hand.  That girl is something else, I tell ya.  Heart of gold, bright, good sense of humor, and very attractive.  22 and single, to boot.  She would be exactly the kind of girl I'd love to have in my life, if it wasn't for the fact that the poor girl's got enough issues to fill a lifetime subscription.  So it goes, though - she's still a good friend.  As I pull into the strip mall that houses my place of work (and only 40 minutes late - sheesh,)  I noticed that the skate shop had a whole crapload of kids crowded around the entrance before the place even opens.  This is not a good sign.  And so, all day, in they come in groups of three to six - skaters.  Carrying their boards all around the store - skaters.  All over the parking lot - skaters.  Giving me attitude and not leaving me a tip with the money their parents gave them - skaters.  Turns out that Bam Margera of "look at me do crazy shit to myself" fame was over there signing stuff, and so every 10-to-13 year old boy with a deck in the area went to worship their idol.  Skateboarding may not be a crime... but can't we do something in the legislature to amend that situation.  This is clearly a sign of old age on my part.  So, the big event today was after work.  Going downtown to audition for this thing at Fox Sports Net.  For 10 White Sox games in July, they're featuring an "alternate" broadcast team, one member of which will be a Sox fan picked from these tryouts.  When I got there, they auditioned us in a group of 6.  We were numbers 119-124 to try out, me being 123.  First, they had us sign a waiver and do a brief quiz/survey.  Questions as basic as "What year did New Comiskey open?" (1991) to things like "Which Sox player led the league in home rums in 1971?" (Bill Melton, I said Dick Allen, oh well.)  Other questions were personal, like "Why are you a Sox fan?" and "What's the craziest thing you would do if you knew there would be absolutely no consequences?" (feel free to ask me.)  There was alos a pop culture section, asking us pop music and current events questions, along with identifying pictures of celebrities.  I got George Clooney, Carmen Electra, and Vince Vaughn; however, I had absolutely no clue who Jessica Simpson was based on her pic.  I think I'm a better person for this.  After that, they led up to a waiting area next to an office, where we were taken in one at a time for interviews.  Since they were doing it in numerical order, I was 5th on the lineup.  As the rest of us sat outside, we heard those in front of us definitely doing play-by-play a little, as they promised us we would be doing.  One staffer was waiting outside with us, and as number 122 went in for his interview, she went in with, and came out with my paperwork in hand.  She then led me to the other side of the cubicle land, to another office.  This is where I received what I'm pretty sure was a courtesy interview.  I was asked a few questions and sent on my way, never asked to do the play-by-play that the others were.  Now, I don't have any delusions about myself when it comes to my appearance.  I can dress nicely andclean up and straighten every conceivable part of me, which I did today.  But when you get right down to it, I've still got a face that, well, is better suited for radio.  My impartial opinion tells me that I was the least physically attractive of the 6 guys there, so, one look at me, and those in charge had already made up their minds.  I will be more surprised than anyone if I get a callback for the second round of interviews.  But it's not the end of the world, right?  Far from it.  There's a job fair I have to go to before work tomorrow, and I'm starting to get some ideas as to what I'm looking for in my new place to live.  Sure, the Sox thing would be an absolute dream, but I knew going in it would be a million to one shot.  In the meantime, I've got more important things to do.  Like lobbying for an ordinance to ban skating in Orland Park.
