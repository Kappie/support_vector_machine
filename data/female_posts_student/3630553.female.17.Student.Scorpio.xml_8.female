Although a variety of definitions extracted from different languages are set into being a Christian, I keep questioning the genuine meaning of this. Is Christianity more to this form of nomenclature and belief?  As a Catholic, I’ve always thought of myself living as a Christian. But for recently, I’ve started to appraise my Christianity not simply by religious classification but also by the ways of living. Like most classified Christians in this world, communal discourse and religious teachings molded my concept on Christianity and Christian living.  Religious ironies are not atypical to every radical mind. Even an innocent child may start to question who created her, how did the universe began and who is her real Father in Heaven. For one, why do we need to reiterate every prayer in the rosary? I’m sure the Blessed Virgin Mary needs to hear us only once. Unfortunately, a lot of people seem to miss the thought. Once but sincere makes more sense than a hundred times but contemptuously idle.  And how does the society define a good Christian anyway? Is it someone who goes to church everyday but corrupts on people just to fund his illegal machinery? Or is it someone who doesn’t even read the Bible but opens his house for people in need?  Honestly, scribbling all these queries gives me the scorch as though I ought to be forked by some demon. But for quite a number of times, I stop and question a lot of things about my faith. By the way, the definition of faith is "something we believe in, even without any proof." I even thought of reading the Bible, going to church everyday, joining worships, and even spreading the words of God. It had only made me feel guilty because I lack time for all these. Is Christianity too demanding, anyway? I used to feel frantic about the issues of devoutness, but I realized that God, probably, does not really require us to be absolutely religious.   This world bears the intolerable, meaning things happen out of evil persuasions, and we must not lock ourselves as though we are living in paradise. This world is never a paradise, if ever Adam and Eve were true. To live as a Christian is not to be apathetic but to get involved. I think that, as long as we are living our lives without aggravating others, then we are living a Christian life. And as long as we know the concepts of right and wrong, and put it to practice, then we are Christians.  And from all these, let me clarify that I am not defying Christianity nor am I denying the significance of religious practices. I only suggest that we ought to know what we believe in. We cannot demand for a perfect world because the world is made of imperfect people. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that none of what we believe in or what we practice would matter unless we are sincere. I stress that – unless we are sincere.
