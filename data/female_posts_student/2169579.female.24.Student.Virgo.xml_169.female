Categorizing and classifying are important parts of analysis. Your curiosity takes you deeper and deeper into the channels of some great mystery, and you are enjoying the hunt. Your innate curiosity leaves you fascinated with others. Keep you finger on the pulse of the underground.~~  this was my horoscope today.  not even funny after an 8 hour day of putting toothpaste into boxes!!!  sum1 has a sick sense of humor!!!
