Well, they are buying the tickets with their aeroplan points, I should say.  I"m greatful, don't get me wrong.  I am however, very pissed at Aeroplan.  Its August, early August and I cannot find a seat out of Newfoundland to Calgary from Jan. 1 till Jan. 14.  I can't arrive that late.  So, with 40,000 points in hand, my parents have bought me a business seat out on Jan. 8th.  I'm so royally pissed because Newfoundland once again gets a raw deal. There are only 4 seats per selected flight out of Newfoundland dedicated to Aeorplan members.  Now, if I REALLY, REALLY wanted to get out, for an extra 12,500 points Aeroplan would MAKE seats available (not in this case, even THOSE slimy seats were taken). This small number of seats out of Newfoundland is appalling!  If I lived anywhere else in Canada, there would be twice or three times the number!  However, no one really ever complains and like everything else in Newfoundland, it will go on unchallenaged.  But I would like to state, that I"m pissed!   And since I"m on the wagon of complaining, I would like to state that for the millionth morning in a row, I"ve been woken up at 9am by construction going on outside my window.  My basic problem isn't with the construction going on outisde my window, its the total lack of disregard for the citizens of St. John's that seems to have permeated EVERY construction company here.  They tear up streets at 2pm in the afternoon, they cause lineups miles long, they take their lunch breaks at the height of traffic.  Now, I'd like to suggest that St. John's city council take a page out of Dublin's book.  When I was living there in 2002-03, there was MAJOR construction on both the Spire (what a waste of Dublins money!) and the new tram system (specifically in St. Stephens Green).  Did construction take place during the normal 9 to 5pm hours?  No usually.  Most of the work took place after work hours, so as to cause as little disruption as possible to the citizens of Dublin.  I"m sure most major citys employ this strategy to deal with difficult construction.  But not St. John's.  Hell, block people out of their homes.  Who cares?  Their only citizens of St. John's....they only pay taxes.  Grrr...  On a much brighter note, Jason Greeley has passed into the Top 7 of Canadian idol.  Good old home town boy from Upper Island Cove (I won't pass judgement on a certain politian from there....even if he is a LIBREAL).  I"ve fallen in love with the young boy (hes 18, gezzz, I"m getting old) from Medicine Hat, AB.  Can't remember his name, but hes a charmer.  And a good singer.  Why do I watch this show, apart from supporting Jason?  I really don't know.  Maybe I like to think that I could do what they are doing, be a better singer...Ha!  Or maybe I just want to see the girl with the glasses get out (cause she ain't special) or once again see Ben Mulroney put on some flashy leather dudes and outdo his father in the public speaking category.  Or maybe I should just get out of the house more?
