I'm 24, and I'm honestly not all that excited about it, but I do love a day that's devoted to just me...and the kazillion other people who are probably born on this day.  Anyway...I'm a little older, but I know I'm not wiser, probably a little fatter, maybe a little happier (than my last birthday!), but yeah...I'm 24.  I am not going to go on and on about how old it seems to me, because in reality, it's not, but I guess I am 24 and I don't think I have my shit together, and I seem to be too old NOT to have my shit together, you know?  Maybe I'm just hallucinating.  I did have a lot of toxins this weekend ;)  It's just that I'm still making the same mistakes that I was making when I was 19, only now I'm in law school and in a lot more debt.  It's scary!  I have to clean our house, eat, and get jumping on homework.  I didn't do anything all weekend, I've just been celebrating.  So I should get to that.  Happy 24th to me!
