BTW, tina i am forever grateful for the everlasting image of you and a dog making love that is now imprinted in my head!!!!  I burnt my finger trying to light a candle - i've been trying to convince my mum, it's a frist-degree burn and needs urgent medical attention!!!! It's not my fault if i won't be able to write for the rest of my life (don't ask how i typed this blog - u'll wreck my story)  Anyway, i know ur all wondering what the title's all about.... well i met someone very special! He's male..(that says it all)..a good dancer, on channel 9 every weekday, can sing and has a gorgeous smile!!!! If you guessed Tim Harding, you're so wrong and so far from the truth  It was Nathan Foley!!! I got his signature - and he smiled this killer smile - i'll never forget that moment - i think we saw into each other's soul I know it's quite hard to sink in - but it'll hit you soon guys, is Shrek 2 better than 1?  Take care, and if ur name is Tina, stay away from dogs!  I love Brando!
