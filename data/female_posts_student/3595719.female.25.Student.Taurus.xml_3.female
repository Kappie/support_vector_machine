Why try to explain, when no one really cares.
Why put effort, when no one understands.
Why not keep silent, no one is really there.


What is that smell?
My thoughts rotting inside.
Why not set them free, 
For I do not know how.




Empty, are its contents
Long, are its meanings
Sad, are its feelings
Weeping, all it knows.


To leave, is all I want.
To love, is all I care.
To feel, I have no choice.
To let go, what else is there?
