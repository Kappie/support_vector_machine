I think I've really got to change this habit of mine. However, Yesterday was a better day. Hahax.. went to catch a movie. Then hang ard. Aint that bad~ Hmm...at least much better than stayng at home and trying to get something done yet can't. HAIX~ I seriously have no idea why some ppl just dun like being more direct and would rather go ard ppl's back. Kinda weird. Oh well~ Since they dun wish to heed the advice of being more direct, they will soon regret i guess.
