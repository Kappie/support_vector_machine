So i was 7 (yes only 7) minutes late to bells.... and not in a good mood.  That afternoon i went shopping with my mother, and then with Chad to help him pick out presents for his sisters.  We went to barnes and noble and he was very good at picking out presents.. he didn't even need my help.. once i got him there anyway.  He brought me home then i left again for hy-vee... no one is as good at prolonging grocery shopping as me.  Then Sean called me and we talked till 1 with MK walking in and out of my room.  By one o'clock MK had finally gone to take her shower and when she got back and i had already gone to bed she walked in appaled.  "what??!?! why are you sleeping?  no don't go to bed."  this is the same loopy girl who was saying "elizabeth, it's time for bed" and hour before.  crazy girl.  Well today.. get this.. i overslept.. and i felt HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was supposed to go pick up laura at 10:30.. and she called me at 11 asking where i was.  UUUUUUUUGGGGG two days in a row... what is wrong with me?  So i rushed as quick as i could to her house picked her up.. then we went back to my house to get my dress so that we would be able to leave straight from the wrestling tournament for my alterations.  well we got there literaly 5 min after he had wrestled... and get this, we left 10 min before he would wrestle again.  it was very frustrating to say the least.  So then we had my dress altered.  The lady had this fun eastern european accent and her name is elvera.  So we were downtown anyway and decided... it's time for lunch.  (it was 3:20)  So we ate at Pizza and Pasta... it was delicious.  And of course, b/c you can't go downtown without visiting Zanbros, we stopped in for icecream.  it was a delicious afternoon.  I tried to take Laura home.. but after about 20 min of sitting in traffic, we decided she could just come with me to bells.  However in doing this we were 20 min early.. i am never early... it would be unnatural.. so we went to Sean's house and said HI... then got to bells 20 min late... that was more like it.  Oh well.. it was just pizza.    After i took everyone home and took MK shopping yet AGAIN... we topped off the day with the NEWSIES.  oh i love that movie.. who doesn't?  Well now for some deep thoughts.   I don't think anything said to me has ever been any more hurtfull than being told i wasn't worth being friends with.  It's the kind of phrase that has just stuck with me.  I mean, it's obvious that I have a lot of friends, and a lot of friends that really care about me, but it's so sad that you can be inside the most beautiful scenery of your life, and something as stupid and insignificant as a bug bite can make it miserable.  I can spend a day with some of the coolest, sweetest, and most caring friends anyone could ever ask for... but when i remember that there is someone else that thinks "you're not even worth the trouble of being friends with, you're not worth it to me" it's enough to make me want to cry myself to sleep and then never wake up.  I know that i'm worth it, i know i'm worth it to you, so why should one voice matter?          I hate the mental tape recorder.  It doesn't kick in until your lowest point of the day.. then what do i hear?  "It's your fault... You're not worth it... you never have been."  And it always seems no one is there at those times... when the tape recorder starts up again.  So then i sit there listening to it, and all that was said over and over.. the 2 hour tape runs out and i'm crushed again as if it was said this morning.  All i want if for someone to turn it off.  Right now is an I-need-mona day.  And then tomorrow i'll wake up thinking.. "no, everything is fine.. i don't really need her"  and that's how it will be for several days.. until late one night when the tape starts again.  Well.. the tape's been running for about 30 min now.. maybe it will turn off before i go to bed?
