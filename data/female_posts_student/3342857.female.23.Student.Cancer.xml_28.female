What made me think so now and not before because, even he had stepped down as a PM (a post he held the same year i was born!), he is stil engaging in those dictator type of style trying to be the chairman of this or that.......i bet he had more than enough to feed himself even if he decided to live luxuriously as a tycoon.....his wealth will never drain as he probably F*******ly eat up a lot of taxpayer money.....can't he just shut his mouth and stupid ego and just 'rest' at home......somehow, i now started to feel ashame when anyone mentions that he's my great ex-PM.....i feel like puking...........
