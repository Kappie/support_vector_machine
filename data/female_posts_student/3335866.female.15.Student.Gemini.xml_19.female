Strangers. You would think that. And you would be wrong.   Okay, maybe I did compulsively delete any mention of Blogger in my web history. Maybe it's true that I told no one but Henna the web address. Maybe it's true that I changed everyone's names. But, moronically, I still neglected to mention to Henna that I  wanted this to be private . Web strangers are different. They have no perspective on my life other than the one that I give them. They can't judge, really, or correct me about events I discuss. They know only what I tell them. It's a lot of power, actually.   I should say  you , I suppose. I changed the address, and now no one but 'web strangers' can read this.   Today I was in a buddy chat with Henna, Natalia, and a heretofore unmentioned fourth girl, Renee. We were joking and being stupid, talking about 'dancing air' and typing the lyrics to 'YMCA'. Blogswere mentioned, and it occurred to me to send a private message to Henna telling her to not, under any circumstances, tell anyone the whereabouts of my blog.   Too late. You probably guessed that. It was Renee who was told, by the way. She's nice, but completely not someone I'm close enough to for her to be privy to my innermost thoughts.   My reaction wasn't anything other than typical dramedy fodder. A quick 'g2g bye', a bunch of quiet " Fuck "s in succession, a frantic change of my blog settings, and then a mildly outraged phone call to Henna.   At the moment I'm a hormonal cocktail, and you know how paranoid about this thing getting seen I was, so at first it was just a long, hysterical rant. I knew nothing really bad was said, so I knew when I calmed down I'd be okay. But Henna, poor Henna, didn't know this. I think she thought that she'd totally ruined my life, or at least completely screwed everything up for a few weeks.I feel bad now, actually. Really bad. It's total shit to feel like that. I still haven't forgiven myself for dumping tomatosoup on my mom's four yearsof  Cooking Light  magazine. (All the screaming onMom's part didn't help, though.)   So, yeah. I mean, it's crappy, but there's no harm done really. Renee did want to know who 'Emma', the girl I'd badmouthed briefly, was, though. As for that, I really should have corrected it before this. It's notso much that I dislike her as it is that I have conflicted feelings about her, and it bugs me that I shouldbe even slightly less than ambivalentabout someone for no reason. It also bugs me that it bugs me. Whatever.   One thing that does help fix this is the fact that Renee told Henna that she really likedmy blogand I could 'totally' be a writer. I am a compliment glutton. With me, flattery will get you everywhere.   And on a completely unrelated note, Henna wants everyone (and that's  all  the numerous people that are reading this) to know that she's Indian (Asian), not a hippie. She feels that calling her Henna gives the wrong impression. The name was at her request, though. On here, all names are at therequest of the person, or they're middle names.   The moral of the story: Be prepared. Likethe Boy Scouts. It doesn't mean censorship, just an awareness that this can be read by anyone at any time. Don't lose your shit and don't be surprised when it's seen, 'cause if you are, it's your own friggin' fault. Kapiche?   Tee hee.
