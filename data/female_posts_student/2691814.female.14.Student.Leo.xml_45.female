I'm watching music videos on Fuse. ya...just really bored. Bill is apperently still sleeping. And i've been wanting to go to the book store so i can get a BOS but my parents said later later later later.....every time i asked them. And if i go later then everyone will probably be at bills house so whats the point? Also knowing my luck my parents have already forgotten about the yellowcard concert and then when i ask if i can go they'll be like...no we don't have the money right now. its only 17.50 to get in so they wouldn't say that anyway. Im so bored!There is absolutly nothing todo. or no one lol. I have never been this bored. well actually i have. its so pretty out but i don't go outside right now. andwhen bill finally gets his ass out of bed..which will prolly be at night...i prolly wont be able to go over there dammit lol. maybe for like 15 mins and then my mom will call and tell me i have to come home like on thursday.....sigh. ...........................................sigh........................
