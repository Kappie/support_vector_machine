We were sitting around, me, jess, adam, tony, owen, nic, and brandon...plus a few extras, carrying on multiple conversations. i love that kind of thing, being involved in so many things at once. we went back to owen's and played cards...uno..of course, i won! :D but yeah..and owen has galaga in his basement. he rawks hard at that game, me on the other hand...eh, not so much. tony, nic, adam, and brandon were watching some weird ass pink floyd movie...so strange...but it was funny, cuz a coupla times that we would look over, it was like, flowers having sex and stuff. i was like OMG! but it was funny. A lot of ppl showed up later, like Eli, and Dan, and Jared. they are pretty cool cats. N e one ever notice how i used ... a lot? eh...o well. So this blogging thing is pretty calming, and fun, tho i kinda wish that other ppl would read it, and maybe comment. tell me that i'm not crazy or somethin. or even tell me i am. it would be nice to know...    p.s. the title comes from hangin out tonite...for some reason the conversation ALWAYS turned to Star Wars...Brandon and I couldn't decide if there was a name for star wars fans, like u kno, trekkies....
