Seriously, so far I've unpacked and cleaned out like half of my closet, going through clothes and getting rid of just some old things. But now, I'm kind of tired and I know I can't win this fight. So I'm going to face the fact that we're not together. But, I do have Kiera tonight so that's worth something :)   And another night begins But I know how this one ends
