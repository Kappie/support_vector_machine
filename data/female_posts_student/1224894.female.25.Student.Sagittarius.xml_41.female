We've missed you Uncle, there's no doubt about that...but we'll have all the memories that we've shared, and whenever we need to relive them again, they're always on hand.  I've met some of my classmates getting our documentation ready for submission since it's already signing of our clearance for the most part nest week. Some teachers are willing to give their final exams next week though, so we need to get this done, just so we could extend our vacation much longer.   Summer classes will start again on the 12th of April and on the 15th i'll be going to Bohol together with my co-lectors until the 18th of April. (I'm crossing my fingers that I'll be excused)  Today, i'm feeling a bit groggy...the late nights that I had simply came back haunting me. I need to get some sleep...Argh!!  And tomorrow, i've arranged the necro in the gym and in church...hopefully,everyone will come.
