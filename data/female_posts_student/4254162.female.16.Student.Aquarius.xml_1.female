My names Rachael if you didn't know, and Im on dance team, and I play soccer (the greatest sport ever invented) for my school. Speakin of that shit, I have to go back in about a week, this summer has flown by. So many memories too, not just good ones, but some bad ones too. Quite alright though, the good ones make up for the not so peachy ones. I work at hell on earth...a little place called pizza king. I work for this old Greek bitch and she makes me go insane everytime I work with her. I don't know why I still work there, money I guess. Chris, if you're reading this, sorry...haha, not really, sorry that your related to that woman. I'll tell more stories later.      Anywho, tonight I went out with Aileen which was really nice because we haven't hung out in forever maybe because she is always out of town...But we went and got some DQ first then went and saw little Christopher. His mom wouldn't let him come with us to caitlin tho. Ruby ended up being there which was nice I got to say bye because she is leaving for Iowa tomm. I watched this video cara made for her and it was depressing, because this year it kinda was weird seeing people who I have gotten to know leave for college, even I know they are coming back, just the initial good bye. It's different then my freshman year because I wasnt really friends with any of the seniors. But ivy never been good with goodbyes so either way they suck ass.       I got to hang out with Alex nate nick and Andy tonight too, its been awhile, but those guys never cease to make me almost piss my pants from laughing so hard. Love you guys..But im done for now, ill be back later....Rach
