Six Flags was a blast, but I don't feel like writing out an entire synopsis of the trip, so if you want to hear it in complete detail, you can go to Azaam's LiveJournal and read his summary of it here:  urlLink Six Flags Trip . In other news, STAR testing this week is a BITCH. What a complete load of rubbish. We sit around and answer lame-ass questions that don't have any benefits for us whatsoever except for some stupid API index rating, which won't even be happening this year since only about 60% of the students showed up to actually take the test. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. So today, we had testing until 12 for some asinine reason, so Matt, Robin, and I left an hour into it and went to Einstein Brother's and UTC for two full hours. (And Matt bought some nice clothes, right, Matt??) We made it back in perfect timing for first period. Hey, it's ten times more productive than  sitting around in school.  Also: Happy (Belated) Birthdays to Leela and Annie!! Congrats on turning seventeen, you guys--now go watch a raunchy, violent movie! Oh oh oh and here is Leela's  BEAUTIFUL  prom picture from the RB prom:     Doesn't she look like a model?? Leela you are sooo pretty, my Indian chica! I hope you had a great time! ;)
