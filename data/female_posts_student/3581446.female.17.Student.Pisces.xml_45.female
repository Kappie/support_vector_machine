Since I got a fair bit of cash recently, I decide to take my brother, sis, mom and pop out to dinner at a nice resturaunt. So we get there, and we learn it'll be a half-hour wait... OK, not bad.   My bro decides to take off and pay a visit to a business associate at a coffeeshop just down the street. OK. Sounds like fun, and it'll pass the time. As we sit there talking to him there, though, it begins to POUR rain outside, one of those terrible, torrential Avril showers.   What's worse, my pop comes knocking on the window, informing us that our table is ready. He has an umbrella- my brother is wearing a coat-  I am in a hawaiian shirt and cargo pants.    Yeeeeah. Recipe for success. I get totally soaked, head-to-toe, and of course that pisses off my mother, who wasn't too enthused at the idea of me and my brother going over there in the first place. OK. Not so bad.   But on top of all of that, my mom, pop, and sis complain that their burgers suck, even though mine, strangely, is juicy and delicious. So I drop $60 on a meal I and maybe my brother enjoyed.   But you know what I say.    Eh Bien. C'est la vie. C'est comme ?a va.   I said that repeatedly, until my pop declared in frustration,  AM I DOOMED TO LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH MAURICE CHEVALIER!??   Sigh. Eh bien. C'est la vie. C'est comme ?a va.
