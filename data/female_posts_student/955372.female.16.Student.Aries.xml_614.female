I had the pasta salad (which sucked ASS, but i am fairly biased since i don't really like pasta salad to begin with) and like a bag of chips. sigh. But mallory gave me my cd. YAY. it's lovely. I don't know like who does any of the songs, i'll have to ask her. but anyway, steven(stephen?) lynch = hillarious
