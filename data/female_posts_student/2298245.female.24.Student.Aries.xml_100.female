I don't even know who some of these people are, for which I hold the Cinema Studies department at NYU personally responsible.  But then again, the whole current course of my life is pretty much their fault.  But that's the subject of a whole other post.  Meanwhile, here are my results for the quiz...    You are Michel Foucault! You wrote groundbreaking histories of prisons, hospitals, asylums, and sex. Interestingly, you thought basically the same thing about all of them. Your historical accuracy is a bit dodgy, but that was never really the point. You were very obsessed with power roles - so obsessed that you frequented gay S clubs, and died of AIDS in 1984.    urlLink   What 20th Century Theorist are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    For those of you unfamiliar with Foucault, I cannot express to you how depressing it is to be compared to him.  I'm sure he was a nice person and all (well, actually, I'm not sure of that at all, but I'm willing to give anyone the benefit of the doubt), but as someone who was forced to read his dribble in college, it saddens me to be told by some silly quiz that I have some affinity with him and his theories, which, being inside my own head, I know is not the truth.  Those of you familiar with Foucault probably understand.
