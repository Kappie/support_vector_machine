Another part will be on the ways that we create an audience and a community.  Then there will be something to cover how I find blogs to be a new space for self creation/construction/expression.  This post is kind of like the intermission.  You can get up and go to the bathroom if you want, maybe stretch, get a beer.  You could go and pet your cat for a few minutes and make a tortilla with cheese on it.  Hopefully you don't smoke, but if you do, now would be a good time.  Its here that there is a break in the thought process. I suggest you go to this link for a break, but time yourself, cause otherwise you wont have time to read the rest of this paper, you'll get trapped forever on this site:  urlLink its that amusing . I've been writing for a while (as you could likely tell by the dates that are sitting below each of the posts.  Long day... maybe I need a break.  I was really focused till this point... Now I am not so much.  Still, that's one of the ways that this medium is good... And bad; I can publish this post even if it doesn't mean anything at all.  I can write and say nothing about anything and still the button on the bottom of the screen will let me put in the imaginary world of the internet for all to see.  Amazing.  I find it utterly incompressible some days.  All the people that could potencially see this (though I doubt that they will).  My writing, me.  Maybe this is a bit of a self centered medium, but who cares.  In the list of self centered things to do, this hurts very few people. Any who, maybe I will go stretch and walk around and maybe smoke, and then I can continue writing.  I just started this post to let you know what was coming up.  Cool.
