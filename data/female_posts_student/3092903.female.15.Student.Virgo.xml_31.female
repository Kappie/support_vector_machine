I love it when people think they've put one past you and they actually havent and when they realize you've found out, they piss their pants but when they find out that you didnt have a stick shoved up your ass about it, it blows their mind. I love throwing people for a loop and keeping them on thier toes about me.   And by the way, for the last time, I CAN KEEP A SECRET. I'm not a little gossip fairy. If anything ever slipped out  it seemed like it was my fault, (which sometimes it is, i will admit, i do screw up..a little..i know, i know, its hard being perfect) there's usually more to it and other people involved that put me in a bad position. So there, once and for all, b/c i'm sick of the 'big mouth' crap.
