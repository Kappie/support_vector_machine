(( not to mention carla cancels the trip to galveston tomorrow b/c of judsons dumb ass caught drinking last night.. yeah nothing gets past my mom.. )) so i finally get home and mom wants to cry when she looks at the reciet from office depot.. so i have to go return a few things that she said she could get free from her work and there was no sense in me buying them. so i get bitched out.. and now i have to go BACK to office depot and return some stuff..  then i went to books-a-million and of course they don't have the book i have to read for AP Am. history so i have to go to the mall and see if walden books has it.. yay they had one left and i bought the bitch.. b/c yeah it's pretty big and i have to read it! fyi i finished my last english book! woohoo.. (( kim pats herself on the back)). now i just have to finish the 3 papers i have left for that class.. then read the killer angels ( am. hist. ) and write the paper on that. yay i'm almost done... uhh kind of?  tonight i didn't do much.. hunter called and asked if i wanted to go hang out at ramseys.. so i went. and i won 5 times in a row at pool!!! woohoo i'm the champion. well i mean the only reason i won is b/c they either scratched when hitting the 8 ball in or hitting the 8 ball in too early.. but hey winning is winning no matter how you won :o) so yeah i'm saying that i'm the champ at pool even though i'm not that good!! lol so i was pretty freaking excited.  oh yeah i found out i have to get my wisdom teeth out not this coming monday but the next ( aug. 9 ) :-/ yeah my cheeks are already HUGE now they are going to be soo abnormal.. yikes! so i'm going to be drugged up for like 4 days.. so that puts 4 days off my working schedule for the summer assignments.. so i'm having to make up for that by cramming more in a day then i normally would.. being the procrastinator i am. oh yeah and not to mention mandey told me the reason harrahs hasn't called me yet is b/c the next interview isn't till not this tues but next.. so uhh yeah i have to go interview drugged up b/c the next one isn't till next month ( sept ) and i definately need a job before then. the people are going to be like holy shit this girl's cheeks are huge. but hey maybe i'll get bonus points for going after having surgery-- thinking i'm a determined girl or something. ;-) but that's if i'm not in bed passed out.  bed time.. i have to wake up and go work out ( yeah dude i'm going work out.. it's a freaking miracle or something. ) and plus i have soo much shit to do tomorrow so i need to get an early start ;-) ( that's another miracle.. kim getting up before noon or 1pm! ) make a document of this shit. later.
