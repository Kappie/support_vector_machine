I find myself retreating into my imagination because to be perfectly honest sometimes life is too overwhelming.  Someone once told me that I was too delicate for my own good.  I don't have the appearance of a delicate woman, I don't have the shape or the size to fit that mold and the saying was let go.  But for whatever reason I am revisiting the moment in which this was said to me and I think I finally understand.  My heart, be it not shown very often, is too delicate for my own good.  Not to be taken literally of course, it beats over and over again healthy and somewhat new, but I do not handle heartache very well.  Perhaps then, I am a complexity in and of itself.  Perhaps then I am not the right vessel for this "heart" simply because I am a beacon for the dramatic, I begin what I simply cannot end.  My "heart" can not handle the situations I rapidly throw myself into or simply attract by the personality I've adapted.  Perhaps this is why I shelter it so often or hide it from so many.  Perhaps this is why I push away when someone begins to affect it too greatly.  I'm not sure of the reason or the end result but I do know that I follow a pattern I wish I could reject.  Reality can be too overwhelming for me, too painful to endure.  I find myself wishing for the simple and in my imagination the simple is proactive and for all purposes... real. ~Erin
