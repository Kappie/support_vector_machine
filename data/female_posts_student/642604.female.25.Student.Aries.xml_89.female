"But you and I, we've been through that  And this is not our fate  So let us not talk falsely now  The hour is getting late" ~Watchtower (Bob Dylan)   "Some night there'll be nothing more to say  When life is seen as the dance of the seven veils  Each teaser reveals the beauty that was always there" ~Body and Soul (W.P.)   "Take your sleep  You will dream anything  You know you will  Because you've lived  So many dreams before  Take your sleep" ~Dream Song (W.P.)   "Climb to safety  After all that I've been through,  You're the only one that matters  Climb to safety  You never left me in the dark here on my own  Climb to safety  Feel the water rising. Let me be your ladder  Climb to safety  I promise you'll be dry and never be alone" ~Climb To Safety (Jerry Joseph)        [ Mon Aug 12, 10:46:38 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] In This Room...  This song is always one I think about in times of death. It is nothing like a Widespread Panic song but I always find it appropriate. The song is written and performed by Leslie Tucker.   In this room  Lives the sweet ghost  Of a love gone away  It comes to me  Whispering  The things you used to say  Between hills and valleys  Was softness where we lay  In this room  It's lonely now   In this room  I can barely breathe  This air that speaks your name  It flows through me  From each corner  And from the window frame  Where we'd watch together  For the sun to rise again  In this room  I miss you   In this room There's a place on the wall  A picture of you and me  In this room  I can still recall  The dreams you shared with me  And it felt like a castle  Now it feels more like a tomb  In this room  I remember   They say true love never dies  Sometimes lovers do  And few ever realize  The kind of love we knew   In this room  There were flowers  Sent to ease the pain  And I prayed for hours  Trying to understand  How one life passing  Could mean this love was through  In this room  I miss you  I will see you again  In this room   [ Mon Aug 12, 10:29:37 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Another Sad Day Has Come...
