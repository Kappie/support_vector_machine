I haven't been working during the week b/c school's out... and so I'm around them more now.  I'm not used to being around them for more than 2 or 3 days at a time.  I dunno... this means that vacay for a solid week with them should be REALLY interesting.  I'm thinking that there will be several fights, judging from today.  I dunno... I've also been sorta sad... internally.  If that makes any sense, lemme know.  What I mean is... externally (as far as Steve and all goes) I've been really happy.  But then internally, I'm really missing my friends and all.  In the past I've gotten so used to seeing them everyday... and no guy could ever fill the void I feel when I don't get to spend summertime with my friends.  :-(  I dunno what I should do.  I could hang out with Steve more... but that's not gonna fix this sad feeling.  I need to spend time with my friends...!!!  UGH!  I don't wanna feel this sad feeling inside anymore... I need to figure out when I can go visit the group in Austin.
