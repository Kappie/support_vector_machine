Well last night i went to go see Little Black Book, which was so cute, Andrea and Phil showed up which was ok bc we are all friends now, which is awesome,, u never realize how much u love someone till they are gone, which is sooo true. Andrea and i used to be best friends and then we just lost it, and now we are getting closer, Now that she knows i dont want her bf lol Man that was such a drama filled fight that her and i had. Well ne ways, tomorrow im gonna be going to k-vill, yah! lol i have to bring rara tho bc my moms weird lol o well rara and i have the best times in the car together lol shes my fav. co-pilot!
