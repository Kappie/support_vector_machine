The first day wasn't that fun I have to admit, mainly educational. Bowling was okay too. Just wish it was 10 pin instead of 5. Second day, really educational. Going all over these science related places. I was sure that I was going to die from too much information going into my brain. Third day, I would say would have to be the best. The ocean view was so clear and peaceful. I was out on the deck the whole time. I needed some alone time, that's what I guess I'm trying to say.   The whole trip would've been really fun for me. Because it was to everyone else. I was just trying to look at the bright side. But sometimes I can't, even though when I try my hardest, the light just comes to slip past me. All I see is darkness no matter how hard I try. I don't know what's wrong with me, really. I just can't get my mind to be in focus. Everytime I would want to be fine I wouldn't be able to. It's like I'm somewhere where I can't escape. I's so stupid. I was down and I made my friends feel that way. I made the trip bad for them at times. I feel so bad. I guess all I can say is sorry. I truly am. They were having so much fun, but I complained. I ruined it. I'm so sorry. Sometimes I wish I had no friends. I don't want to hurt them. I really don't, but sometimes I do, even when I try my hardest not to. Somehow I do. But when I rethink it, without them I'm nothing. I wouldn't be human. I wouldn't be..me. I would be someone else I can't even recognize.   I really want to just walk around screaming my head off saying.."I'm okay" but I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I tell myself I'm happy. I tell others I am, but really, deep inside of me I'm not. It's like I was torn apart, and I think I am now. So much happened.   On May 25th, I talked to him after school. Because the days before that we wanted to get back together, but after what I've seen and what I've heard from my friends. It doesnt seem like he did. I said during our walk that we shouldn't plan to be together if he wants to be with someone else, I knew he wanted to, and I'm not complaining. I've lost something, and that's it. He said that he only wanted to be with me and was trying to now to fix his problems before we go out. I really trusted him. Again. Even after I knew he liked other people. I trusted him. I don't know what made me, but I did. Someone told me that he was holding hands with her that day. And I asked him, what did you really do? He said he talked to her and that was it. Then the trust was lost again. He lied to me again. Again. He said he had to go to Shahin's, so he had to go. I just walked away. All I wanted was for him just to think about us, for once. But he couldn't, and I accept that.   Sudbury days was like torture days. I don't know why. I really thought he wanted it to work, but I guess he didn't. He didn't talk to me at all. I guess that's what he wanted. I wanted to see if he really cared. Joey said if he really loved me and cared about me, which he said he did, he would be the one taking intiative and go up to me. That didn't happen. I was alone at times, he was with his friends. He pretended I was a nobody. I guess I really am a backup, a person he goes up to when he needs someone. And I always will be, but, I don't want to be treated like I was. I know I'm selfish, but it's how I feel, and I felt like that. Like he didn't care..  The dance, was the most hardest for me. I felt the most sorry then. My friends saw me depressed, and they became that way too. I don't know anything anymore. We didnt talk the whole day. I was talking to Nima and it took so much out of me just not to let a single tear fall out. I said that, it was over, I have no hope left. It was absolutely over. But then Safee asked me to the dance, I said I didn't know, but I don't think my brain said that because I was already on the dance floor, putting my arms around his neck. What was funny was that I almost tripped during the dance. At the end of the song, I don't know how but we hugged, and walked together by the back, but said pratically nothing. When the dance ended I didn't know where he was, I guess he went to his friends. I just ran to my room. I remember telling the o4 that I wanted to go to our room during the dance, but we weren't allowed to.   The last day, was the day where we were on the boat the most of the day. And all I thought was, perfect, I can tell him what I always wanted to say, that I still loved him. But I couldn't, he didn't come to say anything. I guess that's what he wanted. I was down the whole day. I tried to look happy, and I caught a few people. All I was thinking was, I guess he made his decision. He did. Yasaman told me everything. He really didn't care about me. He cared about her. He danced with me out of pity. It was okay. I was okay. I was fine. I had no reaction. I remember when we were at mcdonald's for dinner, I wanted to buy him something because he didn't buy anything. My friends thought I was crazy. But I wanted to, even through everything I still cared about him. I came back from the washroom and Erica told me that he had no money that's why he didn't buy anything. I ran to the cashier, but she caught my hand saying, "no". I didn't care. I didn't know what was wrong with me. She said that Vincent already bought him something. At the end she told me that she bought him a pie telling me that I bought it, but I really didn't. That's when Yasi told me. I guess all I could do is say I was fine, okay, normal, whatever word you describe for it, but I really wasn't. I kept it in. I feel like a liar, all this time, I told people I was okay when I wasn't. I wanted them not to care about me, but they do, I'm so sorry.  Now, I'm really moving on. I'm sure he doesn't care, and I've accepted that. There IS more to life than this. All I know now is that I love my friends and family, and my heavenly father.
