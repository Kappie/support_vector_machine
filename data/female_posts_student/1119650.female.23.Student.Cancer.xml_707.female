Friday night I had to  urlLink work  until 8:30, but we had a good crew workin' so it was lots of fun (gasp, did I just say working on a Friday night was fun).  After that Andrew and I went to see the Bourne Supremacy.  I enjoyed it.  I thought it was well done, left it open for a third film and of course there was plenty of Matt Damon-y eye candy.  My only complaint about the film (aside from the fact that there was probably eleventybillion people in the theatre with us) was that as Andrew put it, "the camera was a little BlairWitchy", which made me kind of nauseous, but after we'd been home for a bit my stomach finally settled down.    Saturday I came home and I watched some of the Bourne Identity with my mom (who'd never seen it and suprisingly enjoyed it) and I got ready to go to the  urlLink 311  show at P.N.C.  I was excited to see the show as I do like 311 and their opening act was the Roots, which made me all the more excited, but it was nowhere near as close to being as excited as Andrew as they're one of his 2 favorite bands.  Needless to say when his boss stumbled upon 4 V.I.P. tickets for free in addition to the 3 regular seats we'd already purchased he was pretty amped for the show.  Todd, Andrew, my cousin and I headed down to the show to use the new tickets (they also entitled us to some tasty bbq before the show and 3 free beers, even if it was just miller lite, it was free, so it tasted a lil better) and my brother and his chick headed down to use 2 of the tickets we'd had before.  The Roots were pretty great, the bassist tore it up and they really just put on a show that got you amped.  The seats were awesome, you could see everything that was happening on stage with out the use of the monitors and you could even make out facial expressions and stuff...good times.  When 311 came on it was just nuts, as I said earlier I knew I'd enjoy the show 'cause I do like the band, but I wasn't anywhere near as amped as Reg.  They came out, played a ton of songs I knew and loved (Down, Beautiful Disaster, Eons, Random, All Mixed Up, Love Song, Amber, Uncalm) and one new song that I hadn't heard before which was pretty kick ass too.  They kept the crowd's energy up which was cool and it was just a lot of fun, a lot more than I was expecting to have and I would easily put it in the top 5 shows I've ever seen.  Good times indeed.    Sunday Andrew and I grabbed a quick breakfast at the diner than each of us headed of to our own respective jobs  naptimes and met up again later that night.  All in all it was a pretty great weekend.  I certainly had a blast and as if my weekend wasn't good enough, I had a dream sometime last night/this morning about meeting Jake Gyllenhaal in some restaurant/ice house in like Minnesota or Alaska or something and he was broken up with Kirsten Dunst and wanted to hang out with me 'cause my friend Adam met him in Japan and told him I was cool.  Wishful thinking?  Sure, but it was nice while it lasted.  (c:  That'll do it for now, catch ya on the flipside, childrens!
