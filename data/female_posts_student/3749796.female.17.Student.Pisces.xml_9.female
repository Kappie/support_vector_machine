Get to know many new friends in poly, they are fun-loving and friendly... but i still missed my ex-classmates...whatever!  Had a wonderful sleep last night,guessed that i'm too stress over things recently...  Dunno why, but it's like life kinda weird to me nowadays... guess i'm still under the stage of adapting to things...  That's all for now!
