He's going after some OTHER girl now! He just said he wanted me to break up with Nima. Gosh, what an idiot! Loser! Capital L!  Went to Wonderland with Jordan, Mark, and Nima. It was fun. Had ice-cream, corn, fries, etc. Nima thinks his mom knows about him having a girlfriend. Not sure what to do about it.  Oh my gosh... now he's boasting about his "Persian". Geez, idiot~! Annoying! Ah! Leave me ALONE!  Probably gonna get together with Ioana, Nima, and Martin to work on drama assignment. Probably will need to practise again on Monday too. But I'll have to go try on my grad dress before I show up on Monday for after school practise for drama.  Wednesday  Thursday! Band practises! MUST! For the contest~! My mom's gonna go drive the cassettes to the radio station after school with me on Friday. FRIDAY'S THE FREAKIN DEADLINE!  Yesss! My mom just came in and said loudly that she needs the phone and I hugged her. THANK YOU MOMMY~! She saved me from Marcos! Phew! She didn't really need the phone but just said it to save me. Hehe~! My mommy knows how annoying he is. Muahahaha~! Suckkerrrrr~!  So yeah... as I was saying. I'm thinking of asking Jae is he wants to go golfing with me this coming weekend at the Eaglequest Golf Dome. Dunno if Nima's okay with it if I go golfing with Jae. I'll have to ask Nima. Maybe he can come along. I haven't practised golfing in a while so going to the driving range would be cool. We could either practise outside in the sun or indoors with air conditioning. Probably indoors 'cos it might rain this coming weekend. In the summer, Jae and I are planning on going on course to play together! Total coolness! ^^ Haven't played on course for a while! I wanna go to golf camp again but yeah... Iunno. Meh, I'll see. I wanna beat him! Muahahaha~!  Got Alice an ELMO from Wonderland. I hope Nima remembers to give it to her. I hope she likes it. LOL! 'Cos I remember she Elmotized her AA page so yeah. Meh, gonna go practise guitar. Blog later... or whenever. I'm off.
