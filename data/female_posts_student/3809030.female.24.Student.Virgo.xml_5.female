What to do after summer school is over. Janette is planning a camping trip, but we'll see what happens. The last time I talked to her, she wasn't sure if she wanted to go through with it. I hope we go, it would be so much fun.    Jason called me two nights ago, I missed the call. But, I called him back last night and had a long talk with him. I feel better that I got it off my chest. It wasn't so much that I had things to say, but more things I wanted to say in Yvonnes defense. I'm glad that, that's over.    Oh my goodness, Melissa is gonna have her baby any day now. I am so excited, I can hardly wait. Wow, I think she is due in like 5 days. But then again it can come a little early or a little late. I'm hoping a little late, because I don't really get out of school until the 28th.I have my hardest exam coming up on the 22nd. So I guess as long as she has the baby after that it wouldn't matter, because I heard the final exam wasthe easiest of all exams. Ihope!! I know this sounds soselfish of me,but I want to be available full time to help her out. Seeing that she might need melook over her and the baby for a couple of days. Hmmm..... I have to go to theKorean market too. I have to buy some seaweed and meat for soup. I guessI will make a trip tomorrow.
