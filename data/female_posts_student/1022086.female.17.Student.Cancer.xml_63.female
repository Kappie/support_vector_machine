Shall be fun trying to study for AP exams during every break we get (lunch and dinner)... Mrs. Stallings is  driving us  down there. Oy me. Bizarth will come Friday instead of Thursday, which might be a yay in my case.   Well, at least Hinkle will be there... and Sara is cool, too...   And at least I'm having a very good voice day. On that note, I shall, perhaps, sing a bit ( in my range , I hate stupid stuff not in my range) and then get working on the pile of homework and studying that there is to do. *Sigh*  I like this song a whole lot:  "Float On"  by Modest Mouse   I backed my car into a cop car the other day Well, he just drove off, sometimes that's ok I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say Well, you just laughed it off, it was all ok  And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on anyway  Well, a fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands Good news will work its way to all them plans We both got piled on sadly the same day Well we'll float on, good news is on the way  And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on   Alright, already we'll all float on Now, don't you worry we'll all float on Alright, already we'll all float on Alright, don't worry, we'll all float on  And we'll all float on Alright, already we'll all float on Alright, don't worry even if things end up a bit too heavy We'll all float on  *Sigh*
