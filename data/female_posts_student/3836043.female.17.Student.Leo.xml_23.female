We had to go in with Tina when she went to work, otherwise we would have been stuck at home :p  So we loaded everything up, and went to town.  Tina had a flat tire, so I aired it up at the shell station.  While I was doing that Bill went inside to get us some burrito's breakfast, sandwiches, mountain dew, and pepsi.  Then we were on our way, and we went to a fishing spot right behind Bill's Aunt Kelly's house.  We were going catfishing, but we didn't have any luck.  We caught 15, but they were too small to keep :S  During the time that we were there, I ended up going to the shell station 3 times to get Bill and Zach something to eat or drink :p  I was watching the watch and waiting very patiently for 12 o'clock to come around, so that I could walk over to Kendall's house :)  I ended up being delayed for about 20 minutes, because Zach got his fishing line into a big knot, and so we just put some new line on it because the   line was a few years old :p  After that I left for Kendall's house :)  I got there at 12:40, and rang the doorbell, but nobody answered :p  Kendall was still in bed.. I think she was sleeping, but she said that she was just reading a book :)  I got to see Kendall's room, which is cleaner than my room at the current point in time :p  Even if she said that it was a big mess :)  Oh and I saw some pictures of Kendall when she was younger :)  Then Kendall and I went outside and talked for a little bit.  Oh, and by the way... Grass has a heart and soul :p  We ended up making out,:)  I don't know how long we were outside for, but by the time we checked the time, it was 1:56. I was supposed to meet Bill and Zach at 1:30 so that we could go to his Aunt's house, but I was a little late.  They asked me why i was late, and I just told them that I was preoccupied :)  When we all got home, we went down to an old abandoned house that is just about half a mile down our back driveway.  We brought wheel barrel's down there a  loaded up a whole bunch of wood, because we are going to have a fire, and stuff :p (It was Bill's idea) And then we had our fire, and all I could think about was wishing that Kendall were there to enjoy it with me :S
