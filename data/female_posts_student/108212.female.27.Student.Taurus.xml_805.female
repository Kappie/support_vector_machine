My mom told me today that my Tito Neils killed himself.  He was my uncle who I used to hang out with Saturday mornings when I was still growing up in the Philippines.  I would go to his house and help him make model WWII airplanes and tanks.  We would modify Revel's prefabricated plastic models and make them more real looking by sodering holes on the panels and air brushing black and silver paint to make burn effects.  I remember one time he wasnt home and I started working on this Sherman Tank he was making.  He entered the room as I was playing around with it and broke a piece from the gun and he got upset.  I ran home crying and finding answers to why he got mad at me?  Thats the day I learned not to mess around with peoples things when they are not around.  I am still trying to figure out why he would do such a terrible thing like killing himself.  He is survived by his wife and 2 kids who live in a place called Marikina.
