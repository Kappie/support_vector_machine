The different personalities and how people just blended in and complemented each other in ways we didnt know exist. It's amazing, how bonds can be forged, how friendships can link people over oceans, and how memories will forever be etched in the heart.   To each and everyone of you, thank you for being part of my life. No matter how small or big, trust me, somehow, you've influenced it in some little way. May the spirit of 4s2 always live in our hearts even as we all grow up into our dreams and future.
