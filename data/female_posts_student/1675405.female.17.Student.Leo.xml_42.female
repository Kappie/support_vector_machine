I haven't called him back after Tuesday because he really didn't want to talk to me then... we were supposed to do something tonight but he hasn't called me. What? Have I, yet again, attracted the wrong guy and getting my hopes crushed is completely inevitable? Probably. God I hate being this type of girl- so completely placing my heart in his hands, and if he doesn't call I'll believe that it was my fault, when I know that it is his fault but will refuse to believe it.
