Also, I promise I will get you my piece Very Soon. Just not right now. I'm working on it. I'm not just sitting here with a blank document and a whiff of an idea. Really.    Oh, about the party. How is July 31st for everybody? Anybody? I have a cute house and a cute backyard. I can shoot for being unpacked by then. I live in Decatur, off of College Ave. down towards Avondale. if anyone else wants to volunteer, it's cool with me. What kind of party should this be? Should we have a theme? Should it be meal food, or just snacks? Who brings what?   And one more thing. If anybody need boxes for a move, I have a bunch of very clean sturdy boxes that need a new home. Pick them up and they are yours.
