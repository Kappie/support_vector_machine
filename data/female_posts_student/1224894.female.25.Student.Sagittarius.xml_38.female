For the past couple of days, i caught myself watching melodramatic, feel-good, Tagalog movies...which is by the way...a very weird moment since i don't watch Filipino movies at all cause i think they're just too predictable. Maybe i'm caught in the Valentine web...still, i really don't think it's that it...since i've spent every Valentine for the past 3 years alone.   Hmmm...first, i watched "Till There Was You", then "Kailangan Kita" and now, i finished watching "Ngayong Nandito Ka"...and to top it all off...I cried.   Huh!!! This is really getting weird...this ruins my reputation...:-) Nga Chin, sobra!!! This is not me at all Brum...must be catching something really, really toxic...  Anyways, i'll be updating my Blogs maybe this week...or the next...or next month...
