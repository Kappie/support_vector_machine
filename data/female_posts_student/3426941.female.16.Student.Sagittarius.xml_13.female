I am excited because tomorrow I am heading down to Georga and I get to finally be in a bathing suit. If you know me well, I don't really like to wear coats in the winter and socks on my feet, so when I finally get to wear a bikini and lay out  in the sun I am very happy.   Ryans' sisters are having their dance recital today and I am really pissed that I can't see them. They are younger than I am but have been dancing for way longer and therefore could woop my ass in any competition. I left a message on their machine to wish them good luck, except my mom picked up the phone and began to talk to me even though I was telling her I was leaving a  message on someone's machine. When Mrs. Sextro picks up the messages later, she'll probably be either very confused or extremely entertained. Either way, I did eventually wish them luck and I know they'll do well. Ryan if you read this, let me know how it went.  So I have been thinking a lot about the camp I went to last summer. I literally lived away from my family for two months and I must say the freedom was amazing.  As much as I loved it there, there were many things which are keeping me from going back. There was this guy, of course a guy, but fuck it, I hate him and don't want to talk about him. Ryan knows, so, yeah. I hated myself for it for so long.   Then there was this assbitch director who hated my guts... don't want to talk about him either.  I left so many emotions there that I feel somehow like I'm really going to miss something this summer. I wont miss the food, becauseit was craptacular (Ryan I'm using your word.) I won't miss most of the people either, except for a select few, one of which I owe my life.  Still, at the end of the day, I love home. I love the people at my home, and I love my bf.  Things can change so quickly and it is amazing how one day, one choice can change a person's life.  I only have a few regrets and that's okay. But the funny thing is, the choices I've made the past year or so have been some of the best ones of my life. Even the bad ones have made me become a better person, especially the choices I made at a certain local boys school.  Its funny because I'm almost dreading the summer. In the fall, I thought I had so much time, and it's dwindled down to almost nothing.  I'm hoping weekends next school year will be good, and I have faith that they will be.   He'll be around.  Until next time I feel like having a bitch session or updating y'all on my drama.
