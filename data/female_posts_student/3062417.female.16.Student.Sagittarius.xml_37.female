Then I came home and watched Cheaper By The Dozen and Mona Lisa Smile. Today Carol, Jon, and I were gonna hang out but Carol had to go to Kayla's b-day party. So now I'm here and I'm bored and wishing I had something to do.  It makes me sick thinking about how the vacation was such a waste of time. I had so many plans and didn't do any of them. Oh Well, I don't ever regret anything I do. And I don't regret anything I have done in the past. I have made stupid mistakes, I'll admit that, but I do not regret them.  This is the way my life was supposed to be and I just have to learn to accept that.   Well, anyways, right now I'm talking to Jon and listening to Allister.  Anyone want to do anything later? I'm free all day now.  Song: it's late at night and all i can think about is how i went to work and just sat around and wasted my whole day  time goes by  and soon we forget about the way we looked the dumb things that mattered as  our lives just slipped away   i mope around like there's nothing to do another day and i'm looking for something new i can't understand why i'm feeling this way memories come but they just fade away  it's late at night and all i can think about is how i went to work and just sat around and wasted my whole day time goes by and soon we forget about the way we looked the dumb things that mattered as our lives just slipped away  i mope around like there's nothing to do another day and i'm looking for something new i can't understand why i'm feeling this way memories come but they just fade away  and i'm looking for something new i can't understand why i'm feeling this way memories come but they just fade away -Moper- Allister
