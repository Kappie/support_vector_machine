I didn't update on what has been happening at school yesterday. it was helluva' amusing because my  spare tyre ,   jason   (weihoong) is right beside mah.  ms halizah  probably decided to put him and i together because she thinks that i am the only person who can tolerate his wackiness! i love sitting with  karen ,  jeremy ,  jason  and  eileen ! our mouths never get to rest. dang, i love to talk! don't you??! hmm. no wonder  amily  and i got reprimanded by potato head  mrs chen  after bio lessons. * tssk.  anyways, we deserved it, we weren't even cooperating with that poor lil' soul when she was trying to make us focus and understand the chapter. anyhow, we apologised. that made me feel  really guilty . on a brighter note..  (:   HAPPY BIRTHDAY EILEEN!!!   :)   P.S:  he called!! haha. like  OMIGAWSH!!  * faints * lmao..  P.P.S:  i can't wait fer' tmrw! yeehaw!
