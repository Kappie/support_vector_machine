Anyways to the article:        A few years back I was watching the news when the main headline was "Japan invents Digital Pet". What's this? Sounds interesting! Tamagotchi was its name and it hit the world hard, everyone wanted one, So I did some homework...            A digital toy capable of simple Artificial Intelligence that acted jsut like a real pet, It got Hungry, It shitted, and had moods and toys for it to play with, OUTSTANDING i thought, they must cost a few bob, to my surprise they didnt, so i bought one. It kept me entertained for a few hours, Then i got extremely pissed off by its annoying none stop bleeping for attention, I cleaned I played and what did i get in return? No stroking licking or loving, jsut more shitty mess to clean up as I watched it grow another pixel bigger! Eventually I ended up trying to play fetch with it but it never came back, no great loss.        So 5 or so years later when Tamagotchi Connexions was release I was relcutant to say the least, But my girlfriend wanted one and I wanted to see the new infrared capabilities so I bought one too, to be honest it is alot better, Tamagotchi are crap at advertising, I bet by the end of the next paragraph you will want one? Why because its no longer a Toy but a Game.        Yes this New Line of incorrectly spelt Tamagotchi Connexions has more to offer, same old crying, pooing 10 pixel high gimp, but theres more styles, to the uglyness of your digital friend can vary, 2 Different Sexes are available, and using the IR communication, you can make friends, offer each other gifts, play games, become lovers and mroe importantly Mate.        No I'm not a dirty Tamagotchi Fetish man, its just that the mating is the main part of the Game, Allow me to explain...        The reason I am actually interested in this New Tamagotchi and why I am plannign on keeping the little darling is that its now a matter of endurance, When you first turn your tamagotchi on you are a 1G tamagotchi, a First Generation, If you find a lover and have babies, you are a second generation. and so on and so forth so the idea is not to keep the fella alive, but to keep it alive long enough to shag and have babies.        I didnt realise how enthrauling this was until I was talking to my mate Jam and he mentioned he was on the fourth Generation, now he's had his longer than me but Jesus I want to get into competition and make my digital friend fuck like a horny virgin.        And so I conclude you should all buy the new tamagotchi and all get competitive as I have its fun honest, they cost just over a tenner and unlike the real pets, you can be interested about them having sex without out sounded like a pervert and when you get bored, just do as Jay did and smash it with a hammer.        Warning: No Tamagotchis were harmed during the writing of this article!
