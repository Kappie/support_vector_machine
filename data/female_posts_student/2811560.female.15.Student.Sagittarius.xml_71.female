I got a C+ on my algebra scantron, dammit. I was so close to getting an A in that class. Oh well. There are a lot more important things in my life now than algebra grades, wink, wink :-). I've just been laying around lately...doing a whole lot of nothing. I have to work the concession stand at Springfield Park tonight. Thats an easy $15. Yeah speaking of jobs and stuff, I'm giving a 6th grade girl trombone lessons this summer. Her Mom said she got my name from Mr. Snoeck. That will be good for me I think, since I'm thinking about going into music education. Meh. I don't know how that will turn out, but its a steady $10 a week, add that to my babysitting money, $132 a week, thats a good $142 a week for Liz. I am going to be soooo rich this summer, lol. Too bad my Mom's making me put half in the bank. Oh well. Last parade for the year tomorrow, yay. Thats definitely something to celebrate.
