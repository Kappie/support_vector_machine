And if I could put that last sentence in very small letters so as to denote my sarcasm, I would certainly do it.  If you want to know at least thirty more reasons why I should never have any opiates, you should have been at Vandy Out-patient today. The first thing I said when I woke up was, "I need s'more of that shit."  Actually, I said that more because I woke up during the proceedure and all the meds wore off. Oops! I don't think there is a pain quite like the feel of a giant metal tube in your guts. So, of course, they had to give me more to counter-act my waking up...heheheheheh. So I've been sleeping all day and am probably going to go back and get s'more right now (sleep, that is).  gnite for now, all
