They are supposed to be helping and welcoming us not attacking us!!!!! But anyway, we will get our way eventually. I had a goodish day today. Lessons were fine. Here is a small question thingy for everyone to do:  1) Best lesson/subject? Why? 2) Worst? 3) Best thing about Sixth Form? 4) Worst?  My anwsers: 1) Geology because we have such a laugh with Seward. For example I wore my top with the sticky letters and we wrote 'seward.com'. Then changed it to 'seward rocks' (get the joke there..geology...rocks) which was highly amusing. Then using seward rocks we were finding the anagrams of it. LOL.  2) Probably English with that lady teacher I have. Its boring. We all fall asleep. 3) Free periods. You can chill out in common room, go on computers, do work in libary, go to shops, do schol service. Its so cool because most others are in lessons. 4) The upper sixth being prats and not seeing people as much like Jackie.
