I really shouldn't be making this post, considering he's under the influence. But still, he says "hi". And he says KTHX! to Linds for being at the hospital yesterday, and so do I, again. Linds is awesome, everyone of us (even me, especially me) should be giving her money! He says: "It really helped to see her smiling face after the fact." He remembers most of yesterday...whoops! But I don't think he's going to remember much after he comes up from this. He's actually on oxy codone , which is percocet. Not that anyone cares, I'm just rambling.  Yeah, I think he fell asleep. I'm going to stop now and make sure his heart is still beating.
