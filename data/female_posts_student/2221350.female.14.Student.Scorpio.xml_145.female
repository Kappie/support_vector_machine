I'm feeling it in my stomach, which has been in a state of perpetual indigestion for the last 3 days. Some have supposed meditation, antacids, but I am supposing a quick brick to the head would do the trick.  saw Spiderman 2 yesterday afternoon((against the advice of tr0y, but with the advice of Steven, who said Anchorman was a stupid piece of shit))((sorry tr0y)) the bleach blonde Baptist church PTA bitch directly in front of me seemed to think her cell phone was more important than the comfort and enjoyment of the other 30 people in the theatre, letting it chime out "Yankee doodle" 3 TIMES AND having pleasant conversations without leaving the theatre. The nutcase directly behind me was some sort of nervous psychotic old biddy who kicked the back of my chair when something exciting happened. I politely cleared my throat at the cell phone bitch and turned around to glare at the old biddy, who NEVER payed attention to me and seemed to be totally unaware that her feet were doing some sort of annoy-cait jig. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the height of rudeness. The reason I come to a theatre is to sit in a cold, dark, quiet room and enjoy a movie that I paid 5 bucks to enjoy, YET for some reason they think they have the right to fuck it up with cell phones and footsie!!!   bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch.  and now that I think back on that movie melee, I wish it were the bulk of my problems.   later that night: mom is acting crazier than usual, being an outright bitch from hell. I'm doing my best to ignore her. She sways into the kitchen and begins picking at the leftovers((because she wouldn't eat with us)). All the sudden, she's gagging into the sink, yelling for my grandmother. mammaw gets there just in time to slow her descent to the floor. Our neighbors arrive, one of which is a fireman and EMT. She floats in and out of consciousness and gags occasionally. Someone finally calls an ambulance and Devon and I are shooed out of the area. She's carted off the hospital and we((Devon and I)) are left home alone.   I sit at home, awaiting a call and making a few calls of my own((thanks nick, Johnny, and Donna for talking to me in freak out mode)). I'm unsure of what to do and Devon is being an absolute fuck, so I go to bed and fall asleep around 1AM.  at about 2:30AM, I am awoken from a very deep, medicinally enhanced sleep to find my mother, who is supposed to be at the hospital, and my sister standing over me and yelling very, extremely, unbearably loud. For the first 20 seconds I don't know what mom is talking about, so I try to ask her how she's feeling, and I get more yelling. Finally it clicks that this woman, the one who was unable to stand up without passing out, the one who had me scared to death, was yelling at me because I had thrown away the cheese and herb grits that she had made for dinner. Apparently Devon was told NOT to throw away the grits, but let me do so as she watched me clean up the kitchen.  so I lay in bed for a long while. I listen to mom scream at Devon about the grits and how she's an awful child and things like that. When she quits screaming, Devon comes banging into the bedroom and turns a bright light on my face. From there, she smacks me in the head and yells at me for throwing away the grits. I am half asleep and spent, so I take her verbal flogging without a fight or completely opening my eyes.  at this point, I was all done. I was... Done. It was the feeling you get when you falter and your heart gets caught in your throat. I threw out my arms, looking for something to grab hold of, and found blankness. I layed still and whimpered as my guts folded over and over on themselves, and was too afraid to get out of bed and check the scene.   once Devon leaves, I listen to mom belligerently meander into the kitchen and make more grits while mammaw exasperatedly tries to get her back to bed. Finally I drift back to sleep.     I awoke to the sound of unfamiliar voices and crying children. Out of bed and fuzzed, I came to find a young woman who looked creepily like one of the dixie chicks, and 2 toddlers wandering around our livingroom. The girl's car had broken down, apparently, and so I watched these strange kids while mom and dixie chick went to check the car. The younger one didn't stop crying, and the older one didn't stop smiling at me.  mom seems to be doing fine, she hadn't had anything to eat for a few days and she was terribly dehydrated. She's gone to get her nails done now, and left me to worry about her passing out and running off the road.   poor mammaw. Poor, poor mammaw. Mom has been a bitch to her through the whole ordeal and it's just... Been a really bad day. I offered to buy her quizno's and ice cream, which is our thing that we always do together, but she has to take her brother to the doctor. Apparently since the death of his father-in-law((grandmother's brother's wife's dad)), uncle bobby has been getting worse and worse.      now I'm here, and my stomach hurts.
