I was pissed at first, but now I'm thinking that it might have been a good thing, because I was so angry and frusterated when I was typing before.  I wrote alot of shit that would probally hurt alot of people if they ever read it.  I have a really bad habbit of pissing people off when I'm in a bad mood, just because I don't think before I say something.  That's what happened the other night.  I said some shit, not meaning any of it, I was just trying to get some feelings out, and one of my friends that I was talking to got really pissed at me, because I said that I felt like breaking my promise to one of my otherfriends.  The promise was that I would never cut again.  So I told him that and he's like "Fuck you, don't ever talk to me again".  I couldn't belive it.  I was so depressed when he said that.  He didn't even get a chance to hear me out, or even talk to me about it.  He just left...  But I mean, now that I got over the sadness part, I'm starting to get really pissed at him.  What kind of friend gets pissed at someone when they say that they want to cut, or hurt themselves?  I would expect him to be mad because I said that I would never do that again, but to get as pissed as he did?  That's just not cool.  Not to mention a horriable friend.  He just blocked me, with out even asking if I really was going to do something.  Not woried about me at all.  There was only one feeling that was presented to me, and that was one of anger.  Lots of anger.    The only thing that I could phanthom was that he was angry because he thought that I was only pretending to want to cut again to get back at him for liking and kissing one of my other friends.  But even that's a strech.  I don't think he would come up with something as crazy as that.  But I really don't know.  I just can't belive that he would just get so mad, and not even talk to me about it.  And belive me, I tried to talk to him one night online, and I asked him why he was mad at me.  I also said that I saw no reason for it, and that he was being weird.  That got him pissed and he blocked me.  I sent in reinforcements, but they just got fried and burned.  So I gave up for a while.  Thinking that if he had some time to cool off, maybe he'd listen to me, and would be able to explain a few things to me.    But one thing he's gotta get straight, is that just because I don't understand the inner workings of his mind, doesn't mean that I'm stupid.  And if he just assumed to know what I was feeling, then that was the first mistake that he made.  I don't think anyone, not even the person who knows me the best could figure out what I was thinking, and how I was feeling that night.  I don't even know.  That's because I don't think it was me talking.  I mean, I was always discugsted and appaled that anyone would want to harm themselves by cutting, or comiting suicide, but look at the shit I did.  Now that I look back on it, I cringe, because that's not me.  That's not how I act, or think.  Everyone that remotley knows me knows that I'm not like that.  What I did, I couldn't control.  It really wasn't me doing those things.  It's taken me a while to accept that fact, and come to terms with it, but I think it's going to take even longer for my friends to accept that.  I think that they are gonna want a reason for why I did what I did.  I used to want a reason, but I don't have one, and that's ok with me now.  I lived everything out.  Got wise beyond my years, and put it behind me.  I suppose that with out the experience of actually going through, and living what I lived, it's harder to understand and accept.  Whatever.  Hepefully I'll talk things out with him tonight, and it'll all be better.  Besides, he still has both of my PS2 games and my skateboard, plus he owes me like $70!!!  He better not be ditching me just so he doesn't have to pay me back.  If that's the case, I'll really be pissed!  Well, off to dinner.  I'll write late tonight, or tomarrow to tell how it all goes.  With my luck, I probally won't even get ahold of the bastard!!!  Anyways, ta ta untill then!  ~ANI
