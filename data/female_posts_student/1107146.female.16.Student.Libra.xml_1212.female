The only other person on the face of this earth who might actually no that would be Abby...like I said, almost freakish.  (Just kidding.  I luv ya!)  Rosie, don't kill Phillip.  Then you'd have all those legal complications and such, and I don't think we're prepared to handle that right now.  Maybe senior year.  And what did Alex do???  When you post stuff, you're supposed to give background info.  And no one was apalled by "genatalia!"  I'm upset!  *Sigh.* I'm going to go watch Oprah.
