You know when you first wake up and don't realize where you are or what day it is or even what you have to do that day? It was like that because for about 3 seconds after I opened my eyes, I was completely happy. I wasn't worrying about Kyle or what I'll have to say to him today. In fact, I even *felt* better. That is, until the harsh reality of my life came hauntingly back, slapping me in the face and I realized that I *do* have to talk to Kyle today, and that, today very well may be the day that I get my heart completely shattered. But I'll always have those 3 seconds this morning where I was completely at ease, carefree. And maybe, just maybe I'll be able to go on for another day.
