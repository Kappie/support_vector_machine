It was good to see matt again, feels like its been forever. then i went to the movies with peanut. we saw mean girls. i believe that if i lived there i would fit right in with the plastics which kind of makes me mad and thrilled at the same time. lol   i went to bed early with a migrane then woke up with a headache. this morning i took a nice refreshing shower while BLARING my yellowcard cd.   im peeling on my shoulders and it is extremely GRODY! oh yes and my ear is peeling too. (had to add that one in there for peanut) im not going to ballet this morning b/c i was sposed to get a ride but failed to do so. (boy dont i feel all rebelious) the truth of the matter is that im not a rebel. sometimes i wish i could be but rebelion just isnt in my nature. come on if u grew up with a family that expected nothing less than behaving ur best all the time ud be feeling the same thing. thats probably why so many of us church girls (ahem me and peanut) are feeling so rebelious these days.   well this is kind of a longer blog entry for me so i believe im going to go pack for wilmington...oh yeah i forgot to talk about wilmington. its memorial day weekend for those of you who are already caught in the summer days of not remembering wut day of the week it is. im stuck in wilmington with the family and katie. ughies. at least we'll get to go out in the boat where i will continue to get burnt.   alright well im seriously going to go now but before i will sing to you...  jk i wont put you through that horrific experience
