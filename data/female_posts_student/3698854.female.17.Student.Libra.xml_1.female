She remade a promise that has been broken numerous times. i did not expect her to fulfil it regardlessly but she made it again now and this time... i dont know, i dont wish to believe it because i dont think she means to uphold it and because it was completed before. i dont think i can rely on her to follow through, even though i dont want to admit that or seem to doubt her. I am not doubting her, i just think she has made a rash promise without realising what she would need to do were she to keep it.        "Will you live with me the darkness as i die?"         She does not have the strength to do so, and i dont want to let her....she ought not waste her life in this way, in a worthless pursuit.      ~Aine
