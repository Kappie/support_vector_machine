Whatever it is though, I know I'm in it. I know, the fact that I'm young is a good reason to believe that I'm naive and have a lot to learn about love and I know, love is blind. Well shit I guess I'm blind or something. My boyfriend brian is exactly what I wanted to find in someone and he tells me the same. He's funny, cute, has sensitivity, he's good with kids and I can talk to him, he's my best friend. The thing I noticed is (and this is in my opinion) that every woman on earth is looking for a guy like him, but I'm like his first real girlfriend, he's shy, kinda nerdy and he's not outstandingly good looking (once I got to know him he looked so much better to me). The point I'm trying to make is that all these woman all over the world are trying to find the perfect guy but the perfect guys are the one's that none of these woman pay notice to, they're the fat one's, the ugly one's, the poor one's, the shy one's and the nerdy one's. I'm not saying that all of these types of guys are like that but what I am saying is that in their lives they probably never had a real serious relationship because of their very noticeable flaws and if they did ever have one they would cherish it as much as they could.
