Some Old Hippy Caught Another Hippy Tripping On Acid. I told angela that last year when we were learning it and she still remembers!  which means that it actually works.  =D  anyhow.  I'm tired.  I don't want to do homework.  I have chinese school tomorrow.  I hate chinese school.  with a passion.  but at least I can quit violin.  after school lets out in may this year, I'm done with violin for good.  yay!  I have enough art credits already, anyways, so it's not like it matters much to me anyways.  jack's coming over tomorrow after chinese at... 3, I think.  so I've gotta go and make sure that all potentially embarrassing items are out of sight.  my room is... a disaster area.  gosh.  I hate cleaning.  I hate jack for making me clean.  but he's bringing his other homework cuz he thinks we're gonna get bored and tired with biology, and then we can do our other homework together.  which gives me a reason to procrastinate some more, so perhaps I don't hate him, after all.  anyhow.  he keeps signing on and off and it's really driving me nuts.  -__-;;  I've been talking with him on and off since noon, and it's almost 10 now.  and I don't think his window's ever been closed because he keeps IMing me.  hweaoithowaie .  at math today I kept having spazz attacks cuz epiphanies kept happening.  and then I came up with a way of patting kailing's head that won't kill off any of her precious brain cells, but then it causes my shaking of her head to be kind of... strange.  I have to shake VERY GENTLY, which kinda ruins the point of the whole thing.  beD XTC (7:59:50 PM): I hate coloring beD XTC (7:59:58 PM): I want like a little sister that will color for me dilapidatedshack (8:00:27 PM): ..... dilapidatedshack (8:00:31 PM): my brother won't color for me beD XTC (8:00:51 PM): sisters will beD XTC (8:00:55 PM): cuz they like art dilapidatedshack (8:00:57 PM): they so will not dilapidatedshack (8:01:05 PM): if I were your sister, I wouldn't color for you beD XTC (8:01:12 PM): I"M saying the sister was 7 dilapidatedshack (8:01:21 PM): ... dilapidatedshack (8:01:23 PM): she still won't dilapidatedshack (8:01:29 PM): 7-year-olds are freakishly annoying beD XTC (8:02:02 PM): ...no MY sister will beD XTC (8:02:09 PM): so there dilapidatedshack (8:02:16 PM): you don't HAVE a sister beD XTC (8:02:24 PM): ..... dilapidatedshack (8:02:29 PM): do you? beD XTC (8:02:30 PM): well you didn't have to be so plain about it beD XTC (8:02:36 PM): no I dont'  isn't that funny?  I've already told meng on the phone... but still.  it's funny.  oh, why does everyone think jack's weird?  it's so strange.  but I guess...  it makes sense.  he's too... HAPPY....  scary.  freaky scary.  okay, I'm obsessing again.  that's okay, though.  no, it's not.  alright!  let's talk about my AMC filled day.  I got up at 11.30, ate breakfast, and then got online.  two minutes later, had to go downstairs to do AMC.  and thus it started.  AMC AMC AMC... gosh.  I hate that thing.  you're supposed to do one AMC test in 70 minutes... but I kept going upstairs and downstairs and doing ANTZ and stuff... so it took me 3 hours.  more or less.  less, probably.  then I went to math class.  learned... math.  ning was so wrong.  =D  but then again... I was, too, on some stuff.  (not that I just admitted that.)  wheee.  I'm bored.  I still have... hum reading alg bookwork eng reading studying french workbook left to do.  not bad, I guess.  WATERCOLOR STILL LIFE IN ART....  gosh.  the stupid water won't DRY.  .twoaithwaoeithoawie.  I've got problems with watercolor.  aaargh.  but alcohol is really cool when it's used with watercolor... really really cool.  =D  bah.  I feel bad for not doing homework... haweiofahweoi.  I'll go finish algebra and english reading and french today, then, I guess... all easy busy-work.  ++sunny
