It was my duty, of course, to make certain the Jello creation - a lovely "bavarian" of lime Jello infused with heavy cream - was not poisonous. Perhaps it wouldn't have been, had I not eaten half a pound of it. To make matters worse, my mother is currently enamored with a no-bake cheesecake recipe which requires copious amounts of unflavored gelatin. She made another one last night, substituting high-fat for low-fat cream cheese, and insisted I sample the thing despite my near-death experience with the bavarian. Thank goodness I wasn't at that baby shower today, or I might not be here to speak of it.  Oh my poor stomach.
