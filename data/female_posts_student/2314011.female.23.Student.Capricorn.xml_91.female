Yay!  Slept late again today.  Don't think the 9 a.m. mornings will be sticking around.  Although, I do have a hair appointment tomorrow at noon, so I'll at least have to be up before 11.  Done a lot of thinking so far today.  Wrote three morning pages, the first in about as many weeks, which felt good.  But there appears to be more to say.  Thought I'd post what was happening across the pond last year today, and I probably will get to that on account of the feeling I have to just sit and write and write and write.  Initially, thought I'd just fiddle around on the fast connection here, sip on my gourmet Mocha and read a bit to fill my afternoon.  Then I talked to Lorraine.  And now, all I want to do is write.    We'll get to the conversation in a minute, but I'm more anxious to explore the thoughts the conversation's aftermath brought up.  They've been lurking about in the back of my head for a few days now, brought to life by Natalie's observation in Charley's last week:  "Maybe you should try being a bit more supportive" and the discussion Levi and I had the other day:  "It just seems you always have these bleak, cynical conclusions."  "How many times have I been wrong?"  "Good point.  I just would rather have a bit more optimism."  "I'm not usually disappointed."  "True.  I guess I'd rather have the experience and keep up some hope; it's worth the disappointment."  Seem to go through these every once in a while.  And I'd like to think they help me discover a bit about myself I'd rather see handled in a different way and the process of making that come about begins.  But days like this make it seem as though I'm a long way away from the person I'd like to be.  Understanding, patient, accepting, fun and easy to be around.  Not someone to be handled or tip-toed about.  Then I feel completely over-dramatic and self-indulgent in my "Oh why can't I be who I wish I was!!" self-analysis.  Maybe what's bothering me the most is the feeling that I was on my way to being all those things all the time during the first part of the year.  As has been referenced before, the London trip taught me a great deal about letting go, having patience, etc. and I made an effort to apply those lessons upon my return to everyday life.  Once school started this fall, though, and time and energy became sparse, I think I may have slipped back into an old routine.  My critical eye, honed for any indication of red-flags or warning signs, did well for me in the classroom, but perhaps not in terms of my attempt at becoming a more centered, balanced (see the adjectives above), individual.  I tell myself that looking at my thoughts, actions, etc. is a good sign in itself, but I'm hesitant to be too self-congratulatory.  Sigh.  Processing, indeed.  That's what she's been doing since reading Saturday's post.  Had about 20 minutes to talk about it this afternoon.  She doesn't recognize me anymore.  She hadn't seen this side of me.  She didn't think I'd be this pissy once we began speaking again.  Told her we're in very similar places because I haven't recognized her for months.  Talked more about what the last 6 weeks meant, that they were about letting her go, being okay with her absence in my life; letting the connection we've shared for so long become something new by releasing the grasp on what it's always been.  On my birthday she told me the time apart taught her about self-control, patience and faith; that it was harder than she ever thought it would be and how incredibly relieved she was that I'd finally called her because she didn't think she could make it through the day without emailing me a "Happy Birthday" wish.  Today she told me the break eventually felt good; she began to enjoy the lack of contact and at some point quit missing me.   "So why didn't you tell me that when I asked?"  "I don't know."  Last week, before she knew how I felt, it seemed like nothing had changed, that I'd undergone a process of...well, processing, but I'd left her in that October place.  Today, after she read how I feel, it sounded like she'd arrived at the place I've been waiting for her, had always been here, and why am I so pissy now that I'm here too?  I just wish I knew which one was the truth.  Wish I knew how much of the situation is me and my bleak, cynical conclusions.  Wish I could use that razor-sharp analysis, which seems to oh-so-accurately pin-point the crux of everyone else's problems/incidents/etc., to asses my own life's wonders.    At the beginning of the conversation, she asked if I'd like to meet her if she came to town Friday.  The thought initially made me hesitate and pull back.  Now I'm thinking it may not be a bad idea.  Assuming she still wants to, that is.
