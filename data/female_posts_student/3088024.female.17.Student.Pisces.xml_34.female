I am...actually I don't know how I feel...not really happy not sad...just in the middle...Well today went well I guess...but I have not written about Sunday yet...My pastor prayed for me specifically in Sunday morning service that the Lord would help me with all I am trying to do...it was the most moving thing ever...I cried...then Sunday night all these families came up to me and said they were praying for me in their devotions and I wanted to cry again...i love my church...everyone is so nice...Well today I woke up with no voice and a wicked sore throat...well i tried to speak and i could speak it just hurt alot and my class told me that my voice sounder better and deeper and more manly...well i guess that is sort of a compliment but my voice is going to go back and what then???
