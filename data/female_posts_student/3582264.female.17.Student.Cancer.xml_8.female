All these people were there, from school, my family, my mom's co-workers... anyway, so yeah. I was getting married to Brett, and I was wearing a red dress, which was a little odd. But there never was a ceremony it was just like, i'm getting married, and now it's the reception, but at the reception, i was kind of ignored. So i got food, and sat down next to Brett, and he said something like, "well it's not like we're actually married, it's just a fashion show." and then i woke up. Weird hu? I think i need to start watching what i eat before i go to bed....   -Ali
