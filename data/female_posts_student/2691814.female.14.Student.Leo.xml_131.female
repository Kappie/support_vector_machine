I was so happy to hear from her but the weird thing was i was going to call her today to tell her i was moving and stuff. Well when she called I told her that i wasn't going to Dr.Phillips and that i was moving. She was like 'THATS INSANE!'...I reallllly don't wanna move. I'm gonna dread this last week of school :( I mean...my parents might even make me stay 'home' on the last 2 days of school. My house is pretty much packed except for some stuff that we need. My room usually has a bunch of stuff on the walls...its all down. And I don't even know what school im going to...or what house we're living in. Ok..now im sad lol. I really wish that i didn't have to move....im gonna miss everyone so much. And Franny's moving toooooo...NO! *sadness* It was really hard for me to move last year...when i got down here...i went to my room and sat for about 2 hours alone. Now i gotta move again just when i started to think things were going ok now. I know im gonna cry the last time i see everyone....god dammit im crying now just thinking about this. I can't believe this....only been here for 1 year and im moving.
