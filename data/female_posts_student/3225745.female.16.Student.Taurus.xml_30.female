The funny thing is new comers really do think he is my dad. They say we look a lot a like and that we act like each other. So now we pretend to be father and daughter.     The other day, not sure when, I went to fort worth to unload 5,000 signs from a truck. Half way through we decided to take a break. I offered to go to Seven-Eleven to get drinks. Before Dorr, my "dad" had to clean my face. He licked his fingers and wiped off the dirt that was on my face that had gotten there from the signs. I just laughed. Ever since someone asked if i was his daughter, I have felt like I have had a dad. He does such fatherly things. It really makes me miss my dad, or having a dad. I didnt think i minded that much only having my mom. Now i know i wanted both parents. Part of me hopes my mom and dorr will marry. Dorr is really cool. He was in the military, and is teaching me how to drive a tank. He has lived such a life, i dont think he will ever run out of stories. I could listen forever.     I feel like a 5 year old kid that wishes their parents would get back together. It will never happen but wouldnt it be cool? id finally have a dad.     Anyway I guess I have rambled enough. I m gonna try and get some sleep now. Nighty nite        Jenny
