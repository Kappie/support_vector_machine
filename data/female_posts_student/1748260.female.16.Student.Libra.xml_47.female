Goodness Chelsea..... she's so obsessed with LEGOLAS.... her ORLANDO BLOOM.. faints...it's all over her blog.. Sad to say.. today's another boring day... only the uncle  auntie.. plus their son came... and we didn't go out... plainly boring... *sigh* .... Oh yah.. another thing... did not know that their gonna change band conductor.. Mr Tan L.C.'s no longer the conductor for CHIJ St. Joseph's Convent Military Band..Seen the news from Jacqueline's blog.. Sounds sad huh... heard that alot of people cried. Man why did they hafta change again? In my 4 years with the band, they changed for like freakin' 3 times? Now they wanna do it again. I think their mad. And wait.. why did the conductor hafta do with Jasmine Tan? Can somebody please enlighten me or something? Glad I did not choose to stay in the school. What if it's another one like Madam Wu... I'll scream! Now I even wonder whether I should or I will go back for a visit .. Juz imagine.. another conductor.. who does not even know you.. go back for band  you look as if you're some "musical" stranger? How awkward can it be! :x
