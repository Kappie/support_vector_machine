I always wonder why Do I get so lonely day after day,  Sometimes I even wonder  If I exist.  The only one that ever cared for me  Has been taken away from me. Sometimes I feel so lonely  I just want to break down and cry.  Sometimes I need someone  To talk to, to laugh with,  To share my dreams and emotions with,  But there's nobody there for me.  Sometimes I sit all alone in the dark wondering if I'm always going to be so lonely I have worked so hard to change my life But it seems my loneliness is here to stay
