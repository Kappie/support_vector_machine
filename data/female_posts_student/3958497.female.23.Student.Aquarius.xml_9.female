FiNallY *add however many  blueberries you so desire-1/2 c -1 c ish ;). (this recipe doesnt originally call for blueberries, but my family has been adding our own homegrown blueberries for years and it's really good with them). spread batter in pan. sprinkle with topping-1/2 c packed brown sugar mixed with  1 1/2 t cinnamon. *bake 25-35 min or until toothpick poked into center comes out clean. serve warm (or cold!) with butter/icecream :) -my mom likes to double this batch to make it worth her time..it's amazing how quick one batch of this stuff goes..barely, if not, enough to feed a family for breakfast.
