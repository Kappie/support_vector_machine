Thats the thought that came through my mind. that in two months i'm going to go shopping again... And i am sick of it. I love clothing. Who doesn't? But i dont want to put my imporantance on it... I have a question... I love praying with people. But its different when i am praying and singing, and listening with people... When  its just by myself. Is that right? or not? Just wondering.. Cause i love praying with people. But now that i'm not. My prayer life is going down. Thats what it seems like to me... I dont like that
