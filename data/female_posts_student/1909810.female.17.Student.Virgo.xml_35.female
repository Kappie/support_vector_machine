I am trying to do this stupid little worksheet for my english book so I can take the test/write the essay in class tomorrow and I'm having a bit of trouble so I'm just sitting here staring at the paper.  I hate thinking about what the theme(or themes...) of a book is, our english teacher has taught us that it must be in an if/then type of statement, and no where else have I seen that. And for every single essay or book that we've read so far that we've talked about the theme has been " If  you fight for what you believe in you'll gain freedom and respect"...every single one, no joke.  It gets a little old, and I'm trying to come up with a theme for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and I realize it's about rebellion against authority, and repression, and freedom and all that exciting stuff. But I can't think of a sentece to put down on this shitty little piece of paper that I am tempted to shred into tiny pieces right now, gahh! I like English, but I think I'm too dumb for it. Chemistry too, I am understanding nothing in that class. Oh and math! I am really excited about finishing up a test tomorrow because I know the material...I've complained about school enough, I should stop. But I don't think I have ever hated school this much in my life. Maybe I'm just exhausted...  I need a hug.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY ERICA!  I did have some fun this morning, I got to eat breakfast at Macy's, the freshman and sophmores had to take a test so we were on a snow day schedule, after eating breakfast with Leslie and Sarah we took the disposable camera that was in my trunk and we had a lot of fun...unexplainable. I need to get them developed...and maybe...just maybe you will all be privaledged enough to see some posted on here :)  that was the fun part of my day. And fuck do I hate my part in the play! It seriously sucks..i have this hatred towards brittany now because she got the part I wanted and I don't want to sound all conceited..because I'm not, but I know I could do it SO much better than she could and she pisses me off and she won't stop being...stupid. It's just like calm down for 5 fucking minutes so we can actually get something DONE in the short rehearsal time that we have especially now that we've lost 3 weeks of rehearsal..but whatever, I'll get over it, it just would have been nice to have that part because I could have fun with it and I'm not having much fun with anything else.   I think i'm going insane.
