Anyway, I'm using my new computer as we speak. ^^ The only problem with it is the CD-RW drive, which for some reason chooses not to work. I'm gonna have to take it out and get a good look at it, but for now I've just installed a CD-ROM.  Bah...my brain's too scrambled right now. I'll try back tomorrow and give a more thorough update.
