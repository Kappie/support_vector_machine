On a sad note, I never got together with Justin and Amanda... something came up with the family or something and so we had to postpone it.  It's okay, I'll see them soon enough.  I got some mystery call on my cell phone... still have to figure out who that is/was.  And I emailed Greg about Scuba Steve to get some advice on that situation.  I've come to realize that I will probably have to bring it up and say something to Scuba Steve, because I don't think he's forward enough to ask me out.  But we'll see... he may surprise me.  ;)  I'm excited, though... because my brother and Kathy are coming to town next weekend and Dave and Jana are coming too!  My Dad's stock broker gets him tickets to the Rodeo every year.  This year my Dad got tickets for 2 shows... On Saturday, Rob, Kathy, Dave and Jana are all going to see Robert Earl Keene.  They're going Saturday because my Dad had invited them... and forgot that I can't go on Saturday because I have lab....  So, Sunday afternoon (2nd show my Dad ended up getting tickets for) my Dad, Mom, Uncle Scott and I are going to see Neal McCoy.  It should be fun.  I'm excited to get to spend some time with my brother and all and to see Dave and Jana again.  Maybe we'll all go out on Friday night, depending on when they get in town and how tired they are.  I mean, Dave and Jana are parents of 3, ya know?  A boy and 2 little twins.  And they're only a year apart.  So I'm sure they're always tired.  It'll be nice to catch up with all of them... and I've really missed my brother and Kathy.    Okay, on another note...  I really should re-highlight my hair.... my hair has grown out about an inch... and it bothers me.  Maybe I'll do that tomorrow, since I don't have work.  Okay... I've typed enough and I think I'll stop rambling now... Off to daydream about a very wonderful and cute guy... :-D  Leave me messages and stuff... I'll get back to ya...
