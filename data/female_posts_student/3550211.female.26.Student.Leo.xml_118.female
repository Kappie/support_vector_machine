He's 24 today, but in my mind, he is still my annoying 16 year old brother who's main enjoyment out of life is to bug the crap out of me.   Luckily, things aren't quite like that still. In fact, the two of us have an ever growing relationship, one that is now, very good. I'll post a pic of him later. But in the meantime you can check him rocking out with his band  urlLink All Or Nothing H.C.  His name is Jared, and he plays the bass. The beautiful blonde singer, Renea, just happens to be his fiance. My soon to be sister-in-law. We're a rocking family, let me tell you! ;)
