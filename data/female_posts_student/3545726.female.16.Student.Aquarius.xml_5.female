I, personally, didn't have a Quinceanera, but I had a party when I was 16. I didn't want a Quinceanera because my parents couldn't afford it. My sister doesn't want a Quinceanera, she wants a Sweet Sixteen. There are so many things involved in doing a Quinceanera. For me, there's too many things to do, and it's too hard to organize it. First of all, you need the Damas and the Chambelanes.
