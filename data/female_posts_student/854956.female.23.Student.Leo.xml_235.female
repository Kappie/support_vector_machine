Thank you to everyone who wished me well today, it was quite nice ofyou! :-D I had a very leisurely day, my Mom baked me a cake, and she came home from running a few errands with a new down comforter for me... it was very nice. Then my brother called to wish me happy birthday, and then after awhile, my Dad. Well, when my Dad got home, we alldecided after seeing the weather report (which said it was going to poor in about an hour from when we saw it) we decided to head over to Reb Lobster then. Plus, we were all hungry. So we went over, and I ordered up a pina colada/strawberry drink... it was delicious. Then when the gal got back with our drinks, we ordered dinner. And, since it was my birthday, I decided to try some lobster, because I never had and well, my Dad was like, "If you don't like it, it won't go to waste, I'll eat it..." So, I got popcorn shrimp and lobster tail. Oh, man... everything was delicious! The lobster was VERY tasty. I found that I like it with a lot of lemon... and no butter. Odd... although, the butter was better when I added about 1/2 a lemon's worth of juice to it and made lemon butter. YUMMY! It was good... my parents and I shared it, because there's no way I could've eaten it all on my own. In fact, I didn't finish my food... I had most of my rice left, and about 1/5 of my shrimp. But, it was good! Well, so then we came back home, and I went over to Jennifer's to get my scarf she made me... it's BEAUTIFUL! Thank you so much Jennifer... I love having things that people make me! While I was there she played some violin... that was pretty enjoyable, and rather funny... but not in a BAD way. Anyhow, then I came back home, and my parents and I ate some cake. And now, I'm going to go play some Age of Empires II and then head to bed. :-) Night night all, thanks for making my birthday absolutely wonderful. And more is to come Saturday! :-D
