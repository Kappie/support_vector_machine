Of course, this sucks because no one's staying in Austin this summer... well... by no one I mean Melissa and Ricky... and it sucks because I always look forward to the summer and spending time at Ricky's house.  But this summer... nada... :-(  I guess I'll just have to go visit Patty on my own, or something.  Patty and Trinity... *sigh*  It's a sad thought... not seeing them like, every night.
