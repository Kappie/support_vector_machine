'You' being me, the person I write to when I journal, and 'you' also being you, the person who finds me in blogspace and reads my postings. 1. I have always been an articulate email writer. In most of my emails, I feel like I am writing in a more authentic voice than I speak in most of the time (being generally too shy for my own good, and too afraid of other people). As a writer, I am constantly trying to recreate the authentic voice of my emails in my essays ('creative nonfiction' my literary category of choice-- what a wonderfully vague distinction). I intend that this blog be a space where I can have the best of both worlds, finally be able to write and publish writing, in my own voice, as if they were emails, that feel private when writing, but are wonderfully public when finished. I am excited, and hopeful that my commitment to blogging will remain steadfast with time.   2. I have been a journaler since 2nd grade, and I think that predisposes me to being a good blogger. I have always been good at talking to myself. That being said, I am also secretly, terribly afraid that blogging will take over my journal-writing practice, and I will become terribly addicted to typing, and will no longer feel like journaling is worth my time. That being said, I know this transition has already begun, as I have been journaling less over the last few years, and find more and more satisfaction with email writing, and all of my creative writing (even poetry, the most ink-hungry of all writing genres I think) generally happens on a computer screen.   3. I have a few peculiar quirks that we should get out in the open early, namely: a difficulty in committing to long-term relationships, a need for friends who write/call me first, a penchant for deep ennui, existential depression, boredom, social anxiety and lack of sexual desire. I am basically afraid of any kind of extreme emotional expressions, most especially anger; I get scared easily by its intensity and although I secretly envy people's ability to express it, I avert my eyes in fear and embarrassment when it occurs. It is not personal, and I don't judge you at all for it. It is how I am, and I'm working on it. On the upside, I'm a great listener and am diplomatic in my dealings with others, even if I don't like you. I never hold a grudge and you are unlikely to find a more compassionate and thoughtful witness when you need one.  I have more, but will pause to come up for air for now.
