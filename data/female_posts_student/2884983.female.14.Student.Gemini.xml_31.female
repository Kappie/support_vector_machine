I want to type 1000 words but I am not sure if I can do that without driving meself insane, not that would be hard...well I guess I shouldve said without driving meself sane. cause I am not sane I am insane. like alot of my brothers friends. they scare me. I am afraid of little children. well not really afraid I just dont like them. because I am not a nice  person. :) I had  someone tell me that yesterday. I took it as a compliment...well I did after I thought about it and decided I dont like being really nice. yes. yes yes yes. *nods head agreeably.*  spelling does not come easily to my fingers. nope they dont like spelling rightly or even having  good grammer for that matter of fact. lol one day a long time ago [not reallly that long ago.]  I was  talking to a friend and I said something about something and then I said and that is a fatter of mact! and then I tried to correct myself but I said and that is a mact of the fatter. and she laughed at me, and I clamped my hand over my mouth and growled at her. it was...interesting. lol you know what is  fun to do when people are typing?? press the  ... button. :) cause then it  looks like t...h.i....s... only it is difficult  to do it by yourself..it doesnt work to well.  yays for pointless blabbering and licorice. I am a licorice fanAtic. yay for fanatics :) yay for INU Yasha. I had to tape the last episode cause  the  'rents were watching something...I havent  watched it yet..I am too lazy even though I love the show to bits. I am leaning in my chair and my back hurts, :) yes yes it does. but I can handle the pain for I am wonder woman!! *flexes nonexistent muscles.*     wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  I like balloons :) and cake and licorice and chocolate easter eggs. wow that was almost  SIX  full lines of wheeeeee do the pumpernickle for random bolding!!! *does pumpernickle.* you know sometimes I wish I had a life...then I stop and think why? I dont need a life? I am perfectly insane without one thank you very much :) if I got a life I might....*shudder*.....become....*violent shaking* dare I say it?..... HUMAN?!!!... THAT would be  TERRIBLE!!!  sometimes I wish I were a vampire..or an elf...cause then I wouldnt be a homespun. cause being one of those is  baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad....hey maybe I could be a sheep :) lol. ole ole ole. weeee alll smmmeeellllll liiitttllleeee pppiiiggggiiiiieeeeeessss lol someone who didnt  know me might be disturbed by my oddity.....:) I think I made another word....but then that might already be a real word. I am a duck hear me quack. *quackquack*  BE RIGHT BACK!!!...........................................................alright I am back. :) dont worry I just wanted to flop around the house llike a rabid worm..oh god...maybe I should stop acting like an idiot. lol it is true I do actually have to  ACT  to be an idiot :) lol not it isnt true i really am an idiot. I have to  'act'  to be a smart being. I have 567 words, well not anymore....i have more now but anyways I dont think I am going to  go up to 1000 I think I will go up to 600, because it will be alot easier :) I am thinking this is the most I have ever typed for nonsense, you know who is a really good nonsense  typer??
