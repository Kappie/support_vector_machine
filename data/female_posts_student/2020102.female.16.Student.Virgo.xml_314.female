Is not that God's voice - a voice that will suffice thee in the meantime till the full disclosure comes? Has He moved not from His place to help thee? Well, but His stillness makes thee still, and He has something better than help to give thee.  -George Matheson   This so-called tolerance, which, in my opinion, is nothing but a huge indifference.  -Alexis de Tocqueville   Humanism was not invented by man, but by a snake who suggested that the quest for autonomy might be a good idea.  -R. C. Sproul   Death is not extinguishing the light from the Christian; it is putting out the lamp because the dawn has come.  There is no pit of hell so deep that God's love is not deeper still. -Corrie Ten Boom  No myth is filled with such life. -Albert Einstein on Jesus Christ   When Jesus died on the cross, He was giving "all He had" to pay the price for all the wrong things you've ever done. In your heart, for just a moment, would you walk up that hill the Bible calls Skull Hill and stand quietly at the foot of that cross where the Son of God is pouring out His life for you. Look at Him dying for you! You are not worthless! But you'll never know how valuable you are until you give yourself to the One who died to buy you back. Which you could do right now, right where you are.  -Ron Hutchcraft    I have known many people that do things that they know are wrong. Then when someone that cares about them tries to talk to them about the problem, they get mad about it. Always remember this - When you do something that you know is wrong, you give up the right to get mad.  -Hugh Troyer   God loves us the way we are but He loves us too much to leave us that way.  -Leighton Ford
