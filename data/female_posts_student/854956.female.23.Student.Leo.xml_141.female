Because I closed the deal on my CAR!!!  :-D  I go pick it up tonight after I get off work... it's going to be beautiful!!!  All the peeps in Austin will see it this weekend when I go to Madrigal Dinner... :-)  Anywho... I'll think about putting up a wacky wednesday later, but I just don't know if I'll be home long enough to do it... I may decide to drive to Mexico in my new car... :-)
