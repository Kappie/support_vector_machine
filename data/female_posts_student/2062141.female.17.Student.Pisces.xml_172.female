Right now I'm headed to the mall, I'm gonna go get a new skirt and pick up some more applications.... so far I have one from PetCo and Papa Murphys. I'm thinking that I should get one from Nordstroms, and try to look into some waitressing jobs. My mom says that's a good job just for experience sake. Then I'm hanging out with my boyfriend tomorrow, :D and then on Sunday Charlotte's spending the night, and on Monday we're all gonna go see some movie... YAY then only 14.5 more days of school! I wish it was sunny... but oh well! The rain makes me all cozy and sleepy. Well bye bye!
