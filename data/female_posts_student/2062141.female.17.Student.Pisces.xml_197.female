Well actually not really, right now I believe that I am probably the stupidest most horrible excuse for a person to ever walk the planet. ... I lost my iPod.. or it was stolen... I'm not sure. Either way it was my fault, if I didn't lock my car. I don't know if I did. I always do. ...Yeah, just say it. I'm fucked. I'm not sure which is worse... that i don't have my iPod anymore or how mad my dad will be when I tell him... which will probably be after dinner... Sigh. The most ironic part is that when my dad gave it to me, he said "I put your name and number on the back because I know you'll lose it." If I get a job, (which I need to anyway), I could get another one... Sigh they're $300 dollars and it was my only 17th birthday present and it was so cool ...and I hate myself so much right now I can hardly stand it.  It has been quite a shitty day actually. Which is weird because I got a new guinea pig and it's disgustingly adorable and blond.  Woah. You know what I realized just now? Woah. On Friday Shanice did a Tarot reading for me, I don't believe in them but they're fun anyways... but... it kinda came true. The question I asked didn't come true AND she also said that something bad would happen that would be hard to deal with... EEeRY no? But she also said that it would eventually be a good change. Maybe this will inspire me to get a job. Hm. Interesting. A Pet-Pros is opening soon by the Baskin Robbins by my house... I should work there, I've always wanted to work at a pet store, it just makes sense. I should go get an application right now. Sigh... the wrath of my dad awaits.. he'll tell me I'm stupid and flaky and forget everything and that I don't deserve any of the things I get and that I'm a horrible person. It's all true but I don't need to hear it from anyone but myself. I was having such a good day yesterday too. Who knew running in the rain and being pushed around by crowds of rude people and getting hopelessly lost everywhere you go would be so fun. Later on in the night there were times where I would forget, that I'm in such deep shit, and everything was wonderful and happy. ...Then EARTH TO ME it's not.  Sigh...God I'm dumb.
