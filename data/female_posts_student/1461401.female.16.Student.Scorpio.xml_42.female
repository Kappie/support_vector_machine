I'm listening to Kari's voice drifting through the speakers. Damn her, I thought I was the one with the nice voice in that family. I don't like being proved wrong. Another bite of coffee-cookie and all is well in the life of Kristin. I got a new phone yesterday, which is very good cause I needed one. Ben's coming up to visit me. :-D Good times. This is the last week of school. We might go see Nemo tonight (I hope we do) That would be fun. Well then, I think I'm about done here. That was just a bit of an update about me. So yeah See ya'll around on the other side
