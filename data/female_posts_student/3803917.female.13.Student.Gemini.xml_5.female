Someone broke Mr.R's cup in the frenzy of trying to get a computer. Heheh.  That'll teach him for leaving cups on stairs. Muahahahahaa.  :;Note-I did not break the cup;:  Reports tommorrow. Uh oh. Judging by my tests I doubt they will be very good. :o  Anyway, I think I should go as some VI formers are prowling for computers. Tarara.  xx
