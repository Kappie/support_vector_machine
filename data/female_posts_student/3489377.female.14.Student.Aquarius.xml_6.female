I mean I love him with all of my heart, everyone can tell you that but...Im just so scared of someone walking by and taking him away. I was the wrong one to go and talk to a computer screen and fall in love with a computer screen. I should have gotten my ass up and told him what was wrong with me..I want to take all that back so many times. I always wonder in my head what would have happened if I would have did the right thing. But, it was my fault and I was the one who messed up comepletely. I mean at the time he was yelling at me and I got a little scared of him but I should have told him something. I hate myself and I always will. No one can make me love someone else. I loves Terik the whole time I was broken up with him. I told him I hated him because I was mad..I was too childish to speak up for myself. Im always sorry for myself and for others..I need more backbone..Well, a lot more backbone. I need to speak up to my mother every once in a while. Im not a child anymore so I shouldn't be treated like one. I always do better on paper than words..I don't know why though. I love to write and read. Anyway, back to Terik..I wish he could see how much I loved him because I don't think he knows well enough. He told me that he was unhappy..He also said that he tried telling me...I don't remember anything like that. If he did, he didn't tell me better. Im only 14..I may not know somethings like he does..He is 16 and a lot mature than I am. But, fighting Babe..It's not going anywhere..I don't want to break up. If we do break up, it would be you breaking us up because I don't want to. I love you..
