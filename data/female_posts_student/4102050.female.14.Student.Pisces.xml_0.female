I wrote the poem a couple months ago and I liekd it then, if you like it tell me so... Well, here it is... It doesn't have a title...  To all my friends I want you to know I love you all So never let go  To all the guys Who said they cared I want you to see How well I've fared  To my family Who I hold so dear I hope to hear from you Year after year  To my best friend Thank you so much I'd of never had fun Without seeing you at lunch  To my best man I love you the most I'd follow you From east to west coast  And to myself I'm glad you're still here I'll comtinue to help you No matter your fear  Well, that is it I hope you liked, If any one actually read this that is.  Well I have to go now. I got soccer practice in about twenty minutes. So, I will talk to you all later.   ♥Jeanne♥
