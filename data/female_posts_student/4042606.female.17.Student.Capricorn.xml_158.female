I also happen to notice that the dress I am wearing was probably worse than the one that showed off to much cleavage. It is pressing my breasts together so much that it hurts, and it makes them look even bigger than they actual are. It will be a mirical if I get through the night without having someone grab at me. As for Jackie and Ian's idea of taking a picture and posting it on the website, you two can go to hell. I want this night to be over, and I don't want any evidence of it actually happening. It's bad enough that I am going to have this dress hanging in my closet.
