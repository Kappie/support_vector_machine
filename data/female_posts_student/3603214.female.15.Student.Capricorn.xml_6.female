Once I got on the bus there were like zero little kids n it was like just me, Tim, Clark, n Michelle so I broke out the chorus part to "Get Low" n that was the theme song for the weekend I think...well, the theme song that wasn't one that we sang as a choir. So we're on the road for a while...Aaron raided my seat when I went to the very back to visit Clark n Tim. I made an Out of Order sign and on the opposite side it said NO NUMBA 2! And a little girl was like what's number 2? So Clark put the 'ghetto' version of number 2 which is puping *don't ask* and yo cuse! was the phrase of the day...he has spelling issues. We stopped at one of those places n it said no smoking so I was kinda upset for no given reason and some of them thought I smoked and I was like if I smoked, would I be here? So yea...madness w/ smokin. After our long 5 hours on a bus, we got to the hotel and Katie ended up w/ the wrong duffle bag. It was Tim's. We found these orange swimming trunks. We went to his room and waited for like 15 minutes to give him these trunks and we thought we'd surprise em on the elevator so whenever the doors opened, Katie jumped in front of em and was like "Do these shorts look good on me?" But we scared this one lady and a few guys. Joel ended up getting us. We caused them to b 10 minutes late from leaving to go get pizza @ Giordano's. So we ate, went back to the hotel. Got crappy news that our curfew was 10:15 so we *me Katie n Megan* unpacked and started watching The Others. After a while, we went to the pool but we were kinda freaked w/ the movie. We were on the tenth floor n the elevator stopped on the 6th and there was like NOBODY there. We just looked @ each other like OMG and then this dude walked around the corner and got on. And we busted out laughing and explained to this confused man that we just got done watchin The Others. n he offered us pizza...Weirdness lol So nobody was at the pool and we needed towels for our rooms. We went to the front desk and asked for towels and we found the sacred computer. So we talked and just got off b4 curfew lol. So we went up to our room, bounced on the beds and went to sleep.
