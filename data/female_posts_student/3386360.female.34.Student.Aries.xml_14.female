T.'s sperm donor James has moved out of his state where he was living and has informed T. NOT to tell me where he is. I am not to have the number or address. To top it off he wants T to stay longer then agreed. BULLSHIT. I refuse to send my son back if his biological sperm donor is going to suddenly be so secretative. FUCK HIM. excuse the lang. This is the man who demands to know my every move almost. THe man who insists that we have to "work" together to raise T the best we can. Umm excuse me ? He's so fricken full of himself. He stopped child support as soon as T. said he didnt want to live with him and now he has moved and told T. that "mom will get all the information later" T said in a threatening tone. T. thinks that his dad is thinking of not sending him back. Horse PUCKY. I'm furious. I could.. grrr.. So Mr. I dont want her to know nothing can just suck on a sour lemon and twitle his thumbs he might be lucky if I grace him a visit IF he agrees to MY terms. At this point in time would be to visit T. here in Washington state ALONE (no wife and kids)... No I will allow T to go back on a few conditions. A. *I* get a phone number and address and explaination on why he was attempting to make it a secret and B. he stays for the agreed amount of time (July 19th thou Aug 20) no later. C. I call T when I want and D. T has the right to come home sooner if he feels he needs to.  If that scum sucking pond dwelling bottom feeding parasit doesnt agree well then he can kiss my lily white Italian rear..     How I wish A.C. was here to make sure things would go ok. I know it's my responsiblility but it would be nice to have someone else here at times to lean on even if it was in e mail. I wish he would e mail me and let me know what is going on even if it is to say "Good Bye".. (sigh)     Well I got the place. I'm so scattered brain not even sure I wrote that. Yeah I did cuz I wrote A.C. and gave him the new address. I was suppost to help Robin move today but it's almost 1 and still no word from her. I'm not going to wait around for her. No offense but that pisses me off becuase she is so worried about getting out of there and moving into her new place and yet she spends her free time with some guy who is treating her like crap. But it's her life and she has to live it and I support that I just wish that she would pull her head out of her butt and do her priorities...
