When i was there, i saw a girl from my dance class.  After i left, i went to Barnes and Nobles to get a few books with my sister.  Some of them were The Clique, GOSSIP GIRLS (so excited), The Insiders, The Devil Wears Prada...yes i read very deep, philosophical books.  Surprisingly, my dad didnt question me about the appropriateness of these books like normal.  Finally, we got to the register line, and this rude lady goes, "Don't you want to be standing where you're SUPPOSED to be?" Oops, i guess i was standing in the exit place instead of the enter.  I'm sorry i ruined your day, little old rude grandma.  Speaking of grandmas, next i had to go to my grandparents condo in Southport to pick up food (they love supplying my family with food...).  That was pretty uneventful except for my grandma telling me for ther second time in a week that shes glad i am skinny because you can die from being obese (completely normal, i guess?) Then i came home to start working on my english essay outline, math final stuff (yes beispel our plan is the best), and other boring stuff. Much love...until later
