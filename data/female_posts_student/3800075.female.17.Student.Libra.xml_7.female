We were on the way to butte to see farenheit 9/11. thanx to some people and their damn kids (aka casey and samwel) we were 20 mins late and never made it in. It was ok though i spose- id already seen it in missoula. Jury is still out on this one....  So were sittin in butte with nothing to do and its just me nathan casey zacher and stez ended up going to hastings and wal mart-yay heh- it was ok though. We came home it was a lil after 12 1230 maybe and me case and nathan chilled here for awhile. watched some of tyson and phillips band on caseys cam- i want to go see those guys. i bet they are good live. Jaclie and adam came for a lil while but everyone pretty much had to go home so a lil after 1 they left....except nathan. he and i hung around till about 230. I felt kinda awkward almost- i was glad he was there with me but i didnt really know waht to say. we went out in my backyard for a bit while he smoked a bowl then came back in and watched part of freddy vs. jason. God damnit! I havent seen this kid since he graduated pretty much and now he comes strolling back into our lives. Great timing. I cant let my feelings get the best of me this time.... but hes just so... different- beautifully different ( in a very good way- not like Mr. strange ass mormon man- now that is different to the extreme-bad) Even if i did let my feelings through i know what his answer is. "i just want to be friends" fuck that phrase and all it stands for. That has been my moto pretty much since i discovered the male species, and now ironically and hypocritically ill have to use it soon with Mr. morman. How terrible is that.  How strange is that. that i would actually find someone who liked me. maybe there is hope for me yet. Pff not after i have the 'friends' chat with him. Now i know how jacklie felt with Tony. But anyways  Yesterday i had a party here. Nothin big- kinda tame, really. i had fun though. Nathan brought his guitar and we just kinda drank and chilled in my backyard while he played (what is it with the musical men?) Aww Sam was so funny! i think it was his first time ever being really drunk... he has always been kinda goody goody about it- but he was funny. He bonged 2 beers after he was already wasted and shit just got funnier. but all in all i had a good time. After everyone cleared out it was me jacklie stez and nathan. we talked till about 330-400 then i drove him home and stez left. Ohh and that sweet kid jacklie. I dont know anyone as caring as her. I had to get up early to go sing the anthem at the tourney (which i royally fucked up, being that i was hung over with 3 hrs of sleep and a shitty throat) but when i came home i crashed and jacklie was still here and she cleaned up all the cans and bottles we missed the night before and even washed some dishes- crazy kid. She left 10 dollars too, i dont know why she didnt owe me a damn thing. but i slipped the 10 back into her coat this afternoon :)  Ha well now that i have blabbed for fucking ever I shall retire. Until Time Next
