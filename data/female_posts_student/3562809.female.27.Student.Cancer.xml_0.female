Some people take awhile to warm up to new people, easing into new acquaintanceships slowly, like one might inch into an icy lake.  They aren't unsociable or rude, these folks, they just have a more reserved nature.  Likewise, there are people who will behave amiably enough right away, but prefer to keep things on a slightly superficial level.  They may be very deep on the inside, but they are more comfortable engaging in very light small talk.  Pleasant enough to converse with for a spell, but you don't get a real sense of substance.  Then there are those rare people who, from the first time you meet them, completely engage you.  They cannonball into friendship with unabashed enthusiasm, embracing you with both arms and taking you along for the ride.  From the moment you meet, there are no awkward silences or contrivances.  They insist on seeing right to the messy core of you,  celebrating each quirk along the way, and returning the favor.  They challenge, delight, and stimulate each cell in your brain, and leave your soul feeling overflowing, alive, and happy.  After spending ten minutes in their company, you are already looking forward to the next dozen times you will spend together.   Thank you, A  N!
