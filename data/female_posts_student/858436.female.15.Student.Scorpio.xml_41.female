Just have to write the paper on it. Geeze. Monday we have a vocab sheet due and quiz and poetry project due, and Tuesday we have a rough draft, plan, and brainstorm due for our hobby essays. Man!  Tomorrow I'm going shopping with Virginia and Mamaw. In Carbondale and Marion. There's a skirt in Hollister that I really want and I might get it. I dunno.   What's up with everyone going to bed? Geeze. Nobody's online. Lol.  I got my nails done hehe. They're pink. I'm so in love with this color. "Pink-ing of You." It is so pretty! It matches me. I think I might buy it lol.  Hrm.. don't have much to say...
