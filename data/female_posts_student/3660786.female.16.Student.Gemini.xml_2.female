It's the small one with the unkept lawn, children's tricyles, and a battered Datsun in the driveway. It's the one house small children make up stories about. Lengends about my house:  Myth 1: Anyone who walks by the house is cursed for life.   Truth:  Anyone who walks by the house can hear an enraged woman screaming at her kids in Greek.  Myth 2: "The Witch" comes out at two in the morning at hunts down small woodland creatures for her lunch.   Truth: "The Witch" comes home at 6:30, and eats a half done TV dinner and comlains about having no money.  Myth 3: There is a small child locked in the basement, and you can hear it clawing the walls as it's fingernails break off.   Truth:  My twin brother is locked away in a youth correctional facility, and there is a large lizard in the basement, that tries to scratch it's way out.  There are many more just like this and it is rather funny, but now my mom is mad because I have a dance payment due, and I could only pay $100.00 of the $203.00 payment due and now I am screwed because I dont have a job, and my mom wont pay it. Anyone need a 16yr old Greek, Catholic nanny?
