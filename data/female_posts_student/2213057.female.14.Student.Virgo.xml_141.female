Rebekah:  yea, they have playboy... *awkward silence* erm... i mean playstation   Mom:  *drops her toast* what are you thinking about!?    after i told mom to do her dishes before her nails:    Mom:  bossy, bossy girl   Rebekah:  foolish, foolish girl   Mom:  you're funny, trying to tell me what to do   Rebekah:  *raises eyebrows and leaves the table*    heather (friend) and i took pictures on friday night, after seeing one on the computer:    Rebekah:  heather's really pretty eh mom?   Mom:  yes... that's why i don't get why you call her chubby all day   Rebekah:  *smirks* no mom, i mean my friend heather, my sister is chubby   in conclusion, i will never have breakfast with my mom again. it was funny though.  also, i'm IN LOVE with thunderstorms. i was listening to it last night while trying to sleep. i was kept awake until 4 in te morning. i went outside yesterday night and i stodd in the rain for a while. i love it!!!!!! anyways, i'm off, rebekah.
