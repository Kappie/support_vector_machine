(good logic, right?)    i quickly decided that i would have to get my legs waxed, because i believe shaving to be stupid and knew i wouldn't want to bother with quick stubble and nicks that go along with pressing a razor up to innocent skin.  and whilst i procrastinated during the 6 months of knowing i was hawaii bound, i failed to do any lovely stomach crunches and i failed to really do anything about my growing leg bush.   unsurprisingly, i ended up not doing anything until the dead last minute, so instead of finding myself a nice salon to rip my leg hairs out for me (and having someone else to curse out whilst in pain) i found myself struggling against the sea of holiday shopper crowds, and stores that didn't stock wax or anything to remove hair.  at the 11th hour, i found the only tube of peach (ick) scented wax.  i got to work at dusting myself in a cloud of baby powder, in hopes of lessoning the pain of ripping skin with hot wax.  i nervously dallied with making sure the wax was the perfect temperature, and allowing myself to be in a zen-state where pain doesn't exist.  pain is all that exists when you're quickly ripping up strips of cloth which contain a fascinating display of hair follicles and orange colored wax.   every time the second hand hit the 3, a ripping sound could be heard.  i turned the ordeal into a strange mathematical problem. maximizing the rectangular strips effectiveness over my non-rectangular legs.    but eventually, after sharing the waxy stickiness with the rest of my apartment (some of which i'm still discovering weeks later) i discovered my legs.  hot damn, i'm pale in that  unexpected translucent way.  i mean, i could always see my hair follicles after a shave, but with them all temporarily sitting in the garbage can, i am really fucking pale.  i wonder if i can glow in the dark, i'm so damn pale.  with the leg hair gone, i was completely unsurprised when my grandmother (who several years ago questioned me if i was going thru "a faze" slightly hinting that leg hair automatically equates lesbianism) made a comment about seeing my legs.   the additional bonus of not having leg hair was that it was one less place for sand to stick.  which is a good thing when every shower produces a sandbox quantity of sand.
