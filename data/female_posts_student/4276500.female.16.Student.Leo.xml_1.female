And...I think my blog is real boring...so i figured thinking of a topic every week and we should all comment on it...and the theme changes every week. So i think this week i'll give the topic as.."What do you think about Singapore idols?"yep..either comment or tag your comments ;). Oh and I bought BoA's new album today!!Though her new look seems intimadating...too matured and wild...but it's alright..her songs are great(of course).Still can't find Diana Degarmo's single probably haven't sold here yet..
