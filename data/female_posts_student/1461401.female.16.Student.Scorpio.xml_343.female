I'm still rather ill today, but feeling much better than yesterday. Now I can actually stand up, and if I'm lucky, eat! Isn't life grand? Katie comes up tomorrow so of course I have to clean but then dad comes home early today and says he feels like poo so what now? I can't have katie over here when people are sick. I would feel awful if I gave her this. There are only a few select people I would ever wish this on! (it's really that bad) So yeah... I dunno... Katie darling, if you're reading this, you Need to call me. As for anyone else... ta.
