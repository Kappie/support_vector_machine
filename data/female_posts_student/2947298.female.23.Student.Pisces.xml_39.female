A white gold necklace and Opal pendent with a cute little diamond on top and a design on the side. It is very delicate and elegant but is also good for every day wear, well cuz I want to! It is my first Opal necklace and it is very beautiful. Seeing  urlLink Cirque du Soleil  this weekend and going to this great reasturant on the west side! If you ever have seen the  urlLink south park episode  where they make fun of this event, well it's hilarious! But still I like going and this will be my Fourth ever show of Cirque du Soleil. Ross wouldn't be caught dead there, something about it sucking, but my sister mel really wants to go so I'm bringing her next time!  Naota:  When you're in a town like this all covered with smoke, you forget that there's a world outside. Nothing amazing happens here. And you get used to that, used to a world where everything is ordinary. Every day we spend here is like a whole lifetime of dying slowly. But now Haruko is here. That's how I know there really is a world outside.  urlLink -flcl  Ross, my only hope out of here. My Haruko...   Darkness:  It suddenly struck me that from that day my life has stopped. Everything keeps moving but life for me has stood still. I try desperatley to make it move again but it won't budge. I guess when you are moving so fast so high you have to come down some time, but man how do I get myself back up? Wake me from this horrible nightmare. "Anxious to get the pavement moving. Happiness is not having, to lie on the floor... dead... alone..." - poison the well  'meeting again for the first time'  Is it possible for a person to be comparable to a drug? That's what it feels like... you were.
