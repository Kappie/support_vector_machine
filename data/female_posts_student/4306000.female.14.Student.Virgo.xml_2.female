What The....? it's not liike she's Paris Hilton or something.. rich is rich.. but not famous... what's the big deal? is someone going to pop put of nowhere  kidnap her? no! she still looks ordinary, like the rest of us..      it's when i see ppl with this problem i feel thankful for my parents (technically, father)... i have no limits, because i know mine, i know what i'm not supposed to do
