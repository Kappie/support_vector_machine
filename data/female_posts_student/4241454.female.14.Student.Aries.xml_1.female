I haven't had a lot (only ones in the last month, I'm on my 3rd) but they only last like a week. hmmm. all great guys though that I still like (just not crush) Ok so now I'm on this guy, who is a complete sweetheart. and umm, really likes me back like alot. I think, unless he is a good lyer, which he very well maybe. but who cares
