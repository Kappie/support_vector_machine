I don't know when or how or why we split off from a community where factions were being formed and chaos was pitting people against each other just to form a new, smaller one which has broken down more rapidly.  I say that I dont like drama, yet I often find myself awash in a sea of it.  I have a tendency to care too much about what people will think about me so I take to a group mentality.  Thats wrong, I am a free thinking, intelligent individual and I am capable of thinking for myself.  I know I don't have to like everyone and I know not everyone has to like me.  I'm not a bad person at the core, but I've become very ugly on the inside.  Its fun having close friends and I love them dearly, but I've also made some quick personality judgements becuase of it.    I know I am gonna catch hell and mockings from some people for this, but I dont care, if you were a good person you would respect me for being an adult and for recognizing my mistakes.  I would like to offer an apology to several people: Liz, Matt, Maria, Amy, Joe and I'm sure there are others that I'm forgetting: I am sorry for not taking the time to get to know you before I judged you and I'm sorry that I may have treated you harshly out of going with the group.  I'm sorry that I let what other people had to say influence how I treated you.  That was wrong and I know an apology is too little and often times too late, but I hope you will at least recognize this as an extension of an olive branch.  I'm not asking that we become best friends nor am I asking that you even try and give me the time of day, thats entirely up to you, but I hope you will at least realize that I am sorry for how I treated you in the past.  That was petty, childish and othewise wrong.  The pot shots that were taken are not "my style" and I'm embarassed for that, alot of what I know (or rather don't know) about you is all based on things others have said, and really, who am I (who is anyone) to judge someone else.    To my friends and others with whom I am NOT fighting.  I hope you won't hold this against me.  This is all getting very petty though, and its not fun anymore when we have to walk on eggshells.  I'm not saying I want to be best friends with everyone, nor do I expect all of us to get along and hang out, but I hope you will all start to realize the path we were collectively headed down is wrong.  I want this to continue to be as fun as it was, like back in the Hard Rock Farewell party, that was a fun time.  We're all adults so lets take one anothers hand and all climb out of the sandbox.  I love you all, but I can't stand the fighting.  Its really starting to get to me.  I am blaming no one and I hope you will all see that, I just need to take some time away and "unplug" to sort myself out.  I'm not expecting everyone to get together and sing and be happy, but I do hope some of these rifts can be mended as truly, there is no need for them in the first place.  If we all got to know one another before making these cursory assesments of character we'd all be a lot better off.  Who knows, we could be missing out on knowing some really great people.  I am in no way resigning from the babies board or this blog nor am I calling anyone out on anything.  I just felt I needed to get thsi all off my chest.
