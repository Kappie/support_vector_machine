My parent's understand that i'm a good person.Which i LOVE.  My parents really are awesome. THey understand that i'm a teenager and i will be a teenager.   I've really changed the last like 2 months and they see that.  I've actually put forth effort on being a family member, cuz i realized that soon i'm going to be away to college. and that made me really sad cuz i have to leave my little brother who is going to be 13 in a few weeks and i realized that i barely know him. That just made me really sad. It's hard when you have a 4 1/2 year age difference. Back to being grounded...   at least i haven't been completely grounded...i still have my car, i can still do stuff after school, i just can't go out tonight..and tonight is FRIDAY. bah. Well it's kinda okay cuz i have ACT's tomorrow..yeesh. I made a 26( i think?)  both times i freakin took that thing..yeah i'm stupid...my dad's like you better make a 30 this time. No pressure there.  I absolutely HATE tests! But tomorrow after i take the test, i get to go down to Hot-lanta to visit my bestest friend in the whole world, LISA! i'm so excited! it should be really fun. I still can't believe i'm sitting at home on the computer on a friday night. HA. Oh well.  Maybe i should just get used to it. I never had any hot dates on friday nights anyways. Speaking of hot dates.... "HE" still hasn't called. But i know why....because he's WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. gah.it's okay..it's okay i'm cool, i'm calm. I feel like such a loser today. I don't want to be a loser..PLEASE DON'T LET ME BECOME A LOSERRRRRRRRR
