( www.xanga.com/vociferous24) but that does not mean ive forgotten about my little blog over here. well now that that's out of the way, my life lately has been boring and hectic at the same time. now how is that possible you might ask?? well ill tell ya. Mostly ive just been sitting around doing nothing, and then going to water polo practice. same old same old, but at the same time, i was planning on getting warped tickets, and then they stopped selling them, so i was bummed, then they started selling them again, so i was happy, and all this stuff surrounding the warped tour has been going on. yep so that's the hectic part. hmm what else? oh i saw the notebook! (the movie, yeah right like id be exited about seeing a notebook during the summer. arg school) anyways it really REALLY and i MEAN really good. but sad too. it's very romantic and pretty funny in some parts. almost every girl in the theater was crying. i amlost cried, but i never cry in movies so i kept my composure. (is that how you spell that??) oh well. yes but if you like romances it's a must see. and if your a guy that's seen it and your saying it wa sstupid, you know that SOMEWHERE in your mind your thinking. why cant i love someone like that or be loved like that. yeah you know you are. hmm what else? well i went to tahoe and took pics and stuff. fun fun. yeah i think that's pretty much all that's really happened lately. please forgive me if ive written something 2 times. i don't remember what my past posts are. i think ill go back and read how, ummmmmm "guy" obsessed i was. or more like how obsessed with one guy i was. oh and just for the record i wasn't really OBESESSED. it was just something that i was thinking about and decided (reather stupidly) to talk about it on this. oh well i wanted people to know what really went on in my head. oh im rambling buh bye -drea
