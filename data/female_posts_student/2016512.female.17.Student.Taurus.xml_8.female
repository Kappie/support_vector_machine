I'm uber excited to go mindlessly shopping tomorrow.  Yesterday we had our first Speech meet. That was fun. I got first. *gleeful noise* However, it was also kinda warped. It was Valentine's Day and I spent most of the day hanging out with my  ex -boyfriend...and we spent most of it shamefully flirting with each other. :s eep? Yeah...if you guys are interested, I'll fill you in later regarding the rather...um...intriguing conversation we had last night while MSNing. Weee! Two thumbs up for raging hormones, eh?  I'm quite enjoying having a Sunday where the emphasis of the day is not centered around finishing my homework for the weekend. No no...that's tomorrow night's business. :D Yay!  That's about it.  ~Me~  PS: Do you think we should have universal "code names" for ourselves/people we know on this? Because I know we all call each other different things on our own blogs, and that could lead to confusion on this one. Yes? No? Maybe so? Input, please! 'Cause you know, if I wanted to say, "I hate Lilah, what a whorette...you guys may be confused as to who I'm talking about, huh?" hehe ;)
