It all happened because Daniel has made a friend at work, Jarod. Jarod used to be a professional jockey and together with his girlfriend own a huge (and I mean HUGE) horse named Bobby. When Daniel came home yesterday he asked me if Lachlan and myself would like to go and see the horse, perhaps even get Lachlan to have a ride. I was surprised at how big horses actually are. Bobby is taller than I am and his eyes are like big saucers either side of his head. I patted him cautiously but each time Bobby moved, I moved – about a foot backwards. Lachlan went for a few laps with Daniel holding onto him and Jarod steering Bobby from the front. It took only a few seconds before Lachlan felt right at home on top of the beast and decided he wanted to go for 5 trots around the ring. After Lachlan finished, Jarod asked me if I would like to have a go. I said yes before my brain had a chance to remind me that heights are not a strong point of mine. Daniel helped me onto Bobby and as I held on for dear life, Jarod led the horse slowly around the area. There was another rider in the exercise area with us, and she rode next to me. I think it was her that suggested I try steering Bobby. I SHAT my pants!!!! "You want me to steer the horse?" I said, all shocked and awed. "Yeah, its easy, just pretend like it’s a go cart and pull slightly on the side in the direction you want him to go" said Jarod and Miss calmly rides a horse. "Um, ok" I said, real convincingly. So off I went, almost steering Bobby into the other girl’s horse a few times, but other than that I did pretty well. " Hey Dan, what do you think? Pretty good for her first time on a horse!" said Jarod. I rode around once steering Bobby all on my own until he decided that he wanted to be in front of the other horse and started to speed up. "Um is the horse going FASTER??" I said, trying hard not to squeal but failing dismally. So that ended my ride of Bobby the horse. Daniel also had a turn, but almost steered poor Bobby into a fence so he lasted a big 20 seconds before asking to get off – right. Now. We watched Jarod take him for a gallop around the paddock and of course, he made it look so easy. His dog ran along behind him excitedly and as Daniel said, it was a real ‘Aussie’ sight. So now I’m thinking that I would like to learn how to ride a horse and one-day own one. Daniel new that was going to happen so he asked Jarod earlier in the day how much it cost’s to keep a horse so that he could tell me there was no way I can get one. Oh well, I will always have Bobby.
