Jason Mraz is playing in DC on May 27. ...That's the night before finial exams begin... :(  G said I don't have to start coming to rehearsals for  Mockingbird  until sometime in May.  I got the feeling today that I wasn't actually needed at all, which doesn't bother me at all.  G said that Ben is doing sound also (I was so excited about doing it by myself and not having to put up with anyone's crap) and that there are only a few sound effects plus some stage mics that we'll be using.  Two people are defintely not needed. I'll ask G sometime if he actually needs/wants me.  Being unneeded does not bother me at all... Especially when it means that I will have more free time than I can shake a stick at.  I'm bored. Bah.  ...Save me?...
