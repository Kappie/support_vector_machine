We couldn't get into the car park, we had to park miles down the road, and then there was so many people in there it was dangerous!!! I nearly lost a toe, being run over by a mad old woman and her trolley. Safeways is a much safer place to live. Plus, they have all their xmas sweeties reduced already. Big Bags of chocolate coins for 39p, and HUGE drums of xmas-tree marshmellows for only 99p. Bargain. Plus 10% off, makes life so much more fun. My mummy got £47 off her shopping in double discount weekend, twas very cool! Meant that the alcohol i pursuaded her to buy was only £3.20- bargain! Anywho, must go now! Things to do, chocolate coins to munch!! Bye!
