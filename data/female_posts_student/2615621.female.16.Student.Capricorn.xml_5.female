Lorne went for the weekend to Charoltte for a West Coast/Orange County chopper bike show..i bet he was really excited, he loves those things. He didnt tell me he was going, his friend did. I missed him all weekend, just not talking to him. I haven't talked to him since like Thursday. I thought about calling him yesterday but decided not to, i just honestly wanted to hear his voice. Well, comes to find out, it wouldnt have done any good, he went to California. And again, he didnt tell me. I have all these thoughts in my head i want to tell him, i  NEED  to tell him just so i can get it all straight in my lil head. I want to tell him that i still have feelings for him, and no matter how hard i try to push him away i just end up chasing back after him. It's like kicking a ball around. You kick the ball as hard as you can, and if it had feelings i'm sure it would hurt (lol) and then you want it back so you run as fast as you can to go get it..but only to kick it again. I want to stop playing ball...i don't want to chase it anymore. I decided that if i really was over lorne then i would have stopped caring so damn much and he would be outta my head. But there is that little angel on my left side that tells me "if you get him back you'll turn around and do the same thing all over again, and hurt him more" and then the lil devil on my right side says "get him back, you want him for the MOMENT". this may sound against all i have ever said or thought about him, but the best thing that could happen would for him to say "julia, i gave it a chance, but i just dont want to try it again with you" Him saying that would settle everything, i would get it through my head that he doesnt like me anymore, that he doesnt care, and knowing that would FORCE me to stop caring and to stop liking him. I wouldn't have a choice. I want him to say that...but then again, i like him. I want him to make the decision, do we try it again or do we stop and go on by ourselves. Wow..i was just honest with myself.
