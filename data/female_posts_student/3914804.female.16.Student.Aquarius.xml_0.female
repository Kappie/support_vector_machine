(perhaps not if you're a recovering alcoholic, etcetera, but you get what I mean...) My addictions include: Texting, eating vast quantities of icecream, listening to music, speaking 2 people, reading, etcetera etcetera.   Addiction- i define it as needing something, and suffering from some sort of withdrawal symptoms if you are deprived of it (and yes, I get that with all of the above!!) My small banana-covered dictionary (I'm damned if I'm disturbing the precariously balanced books in my smallest bookcase to get the huge one out...) defines addiction as "the condition of being abnormally dependent on some habit." Excuse me -   abnormally??   I may be abnormal in many ways, but i defend the rights of addicts everywhere (at least, those whose habits do not excessively cause harm to others!! Like smokers    So must go, STILL got some packing to do!
