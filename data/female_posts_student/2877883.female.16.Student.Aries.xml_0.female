So, I've decided to make a list of all the things that I'm excited about that shall be happening in March.  1.  John Mayer in Concert Saturday, March 20, 2004, Providence Rhode Island, 8:00 P.M. with special guests Guster with the fabulously awesome also-John-Mayer-loving cool kid Sar  2.  The entire day of March 20th in which we shall make a day of the concert and go to Providence Place and eat at one of many restaurants, possibly the Cheesecake Factory, which is pure excitement in itself  3.  Visiting Parker for the second year in a row for National Dresa Visits Parker Day  4.  St. Patricks Day for the pure joy of wearing a lot of green and the funny thought of dancing little men  5.  MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY March 31, 2004 (and to be precise, 3:59 P to the M)  We all know how super excited I get about this day, and I really don't care if people get annoyed with this fact because I l-o-v-e my birthday  6.  The weekend before my birthday during which my absolute best friends who are the coolest kids in the world and I shall literally have a fabulous par-tay in celebration of the fine day that will follow on the following Wednesday, the thirty-first of March  This month is going to be super uber cool.     To bad it is the longest month of the school year and I have way too many things to do that I am extremely not looking forward to.  These include:  1. My History term project- due Monday, March 15th  2. My English Critique due Thursday March 18th  3.  John-Jacob Jingle Hemier's Baptism  4.  Working on my year-long bio project  5.  Another English project  And I'm sure even more things than what I am aware of right now.    I love March  Also, if you are one of the many cool people who enjoy being enlightened by reading my blog, want to leave me a comment?  I think it is super cool when people read this, but I have no idea who does.
