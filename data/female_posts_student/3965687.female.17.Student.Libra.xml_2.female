It wasn't anything special; it was actually very commonplace...the normal,emotionless sex that we always seemed to have because it never mattered to me whether or not we did. Every time we were together, that's what we did, regardless of my desire to do other things. I'm glad he's gone; but the sound of him crying and whining on the phone to me, and the memory of our relationship before it all became wreck and ruin still hurts. Today at work, I was pensive and slightly sad because of it. My silence and the absence of customers gave me some time to think, and I tried not to dwell on that specifically. I thought instead of the times before I dated some of these fools...when the guys in my life were almost completely comprised of those I knew in martial arts. Back when I used to have fun with the guys I knew. Especially when Mr. B wasn't there. The lesson would be taught either by myself or Tommy, and mostly would be spent sparring amongst ourselves. There is nothing better in this world than lying in the warmth of the afternoon with friends after physical exertion, skin pressed against the coolness of the grass, feeling the heavy heat in your muscles and knowing they'll be sore the next day and loving it. Our belts and do bak tops would be thrown to one side due to the casual nature of the lesson, and I'd be nestled in the shade while everyone else was in the sunshine-- about twenty minutes in the sun is enough to burn me pretty badly, and after the painful process of peeling, my skin is just freckled...I can't tan-- making sure that everyone was hydrated, that Wes's nose was okay, that the crack I'd taken with the staff was reallyonly a bruise. It was even better when Kyron was still there, because behind his perverted immaturity     he was my intellectual and physical equal. Every one of them was my rock in some capacity. I counted on them, on their sweet, brotherly honesty, and I thought that I could get that from any guy; I thought it was a given, took it for granted. Friends and neighbors....times like that, men like that....are so unspeakably rare. Next to men like those I've been friends with, those I've dated hardly bear mentioning. It's not often you can beat the hell out of a guy, have him knock you on your ass, and then hug each other like nothing happened. At one belt test, when Wes almost liberated one of my teeth and busted my lip, I think we even shocked our grandmaster by hugging afterward. Men like that aren't made for dating, sadly. I wish they were. Axyl
