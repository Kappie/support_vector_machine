Cinema on Wednesday, 12.15, Grants, Peter Pan. Come if you wish, bring who you want.  Question / topic to discuss this week:  Guns.  A policeman was killed a few days ago from a shooting. Should we be allowed to carry guns? America have a death rate of over 11,000 people a year being killed by guns. Your views?
