It was kinda funny actually!!  so yep 13 school days til Grad but 12 school days til I'm gone cuz on the 22nd is my last day of school cuz im not going on grad day. No way cuz i won't have ANY time whatsoever to get my hair done, my nails, makeup etc. and have my dress on and ready and take pictures n crap and be ready for 3 to leave at 4 and get seats at the church for 5 cuz that's when it starts... tres confusing and tres lame... but oh well.
