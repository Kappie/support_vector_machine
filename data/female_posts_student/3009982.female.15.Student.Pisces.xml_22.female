I don't think its bad or sinful or anything, its just I feel uneasy or rather like I've no control over how I feel or act because you: the person who understand me- knows what I feel, what I'm going to say and how I will act.  For me especially, I don't like to mix with people who are you could say the same type/kind of person I am. I need to be with someone of the opposite side. Well, that sounds so extreme, yeah maybe that's an exaggeration but it's sorta something like that.   There is one person who I entirely surrender to, though. His name is Jesus...like the fragrance after the rain. Yeap, He knows me totally. Even if I don't like it, He does. And don't worry, I don't mind one bit. He's the only one I that I let Him know me and I talk to Him knowing He knows me inside out. He's part of me anyway, so how can He not know me if He's a part of me?   But once in a while, when a friend surprises me with something I never thought she knew, its nice to know that friends understand you, that they're concern and they would like to know you more.   The other night, at a sleepover, my friends were saying that what I am isn't how I portray myself to be (??). As in, you could not guess what kinda person I really am by just looking at me. Not that I'm a wearing a mask or anything, its just there's this deeper side to me. Hmm, does that mean I usually portray myself to be shallow? Whoa, nah I'm kidding. Btw, yeah I think I'm like that too, that you wouldn't know me unless you know me, you know?   That's spooky, eh?.. Your best friends saying that there's more to me than what they already know.   Oh I don't know. I've many different kinda friends. A lot of em close, but I don't know what goes on in their minds. I seem to have underestimated the surprises my friends can give me by sharing a lil bit more of their deeper side, perhaps? It's wonderful you know, discovering people. I love it. Though it does get shocking sometimes, it gives you a sense of warmness, that 'hey! I know that fella better.'  Man, this whole thing is so self-centered. Everything's about me. That's not good you know. Everything I think about shouldn't be me. But I still am thinking about me. That's a sin you know.. Knowing something is wrong but still continues doing it. Sigh, I'm sinning just thinking all these stuff bout ME.   I read last night on Jared Anderson's (the keyboardist from New Life Church) website: "Question. How was teenage life?  -An adventure. A blast. The real answers are illusive. A process. That's pretty accurate. Adolescence is where you figure out who you are, what you like, and what you dislike. It's a game. And you never find out what you've won until you've lost."  Yeah discovering your identity.. Sorting out your personal issues. That sounds so like me. I always thought I wasn't a typical teenager.. rebel against parents, peer pressure, do drugs, go with the fashion trends, like hot guys blah blah. It that sense of typical teenager, yeah, I'm not one. But in the emotional sense, yes. No no, not struggling with anger or violence or thoughts of suicide  I just think a lot, bout life, bout God, bout me. Yeah, about ME. Woohoo. Hehe. I live with a OT teacher/pastor and I came from a Presbyterian church, not much room for that kinda stuff, don't  you think? Goodness, I seriously think so much that sometimes my mind could just explode and all the tissues and blood will just fly all over the walls and stain the ceiling. Eh, but the mind isn't an organ woh. Only the brain is. Hehe  Anyways, sometimes I wonder whether when you're older, settled down with a job, married and a few kids.. Whether at that age, you'll still wonder bout your identity issues, problems with best friends and all. I guess not since you won't be having sleepovers and wondering about how the future is going to be (hey, I said wondering not worrying).  Hah, so for now, I will have to accept that I am a typical teenager (urgh I can't bear that word, so overused) and that I have issues with my thinking and attitude. And I have lotsa to tell but I will do that later cos I need a break from this selfish sinful thinking of my self.   Goodnight. Love,  Mary-Ruth
