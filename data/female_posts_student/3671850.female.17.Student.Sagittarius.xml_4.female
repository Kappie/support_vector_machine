I really hope everything will be okay, but if its not then at least I know that I still have a wonderful friendship.   I also passed on my mustang- georgia man  to Jessica--which satisfies me greatly--no more redneck grammar, whew.  Anyway, I have also given up on the job search.  Does ANYONE realize how bad the economy is right now, hello???  I hope its not this hard to get a job when I'm older--I'll just have to run the  corner .   Today I only had to work from 11:45-1:45.. okay so i made like what, 10 bucks, after taxes.... ohhhhh yea, rollin in the big do' now.  After work I went to my grandmothers to help her with some paperwork and then I came home to get ready to see Chad... first time in like 20 something days!!! I really, really missed him.  I gave him his New York shirt and he bought the  Alice in Wonderland p urse for me--the one that I wanted soooo bad in Florida.  We went to Sticky Fingers with his family and his grandmother told us how onions, and tomatos, and blueberries... etc were good for you.  Then back to his house to watch tv and look at prom pictures that I still had not gotten (and listen to the true confessions of Papa Smurf.. pew pew pew), and last we came back to my house to play with Morgan (while she played dress up with Chad).  I had a really fun time today with Chad, I just  haaaate  that I have to work tomorrow.. grrr.
