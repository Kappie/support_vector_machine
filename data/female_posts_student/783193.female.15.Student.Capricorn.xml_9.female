Lindsay, Sonali, and Alysia said 'No clothes'.. perhaps they will all run around nekky when the grow up.. Then Ro was being all specific, like 'A long black and white scarf that is approximately two miles long, with one millimeter fringe on the sides, found at Banana Republic for $85.' Hmmm.. I won't even mention mine. Heh. heh. heh. (Hence my mood.) And then there was the whole "Don't tell!" thing. My goodness, who knew that gift giving would be such a hassle? Speaking of gift giving... I can't wait to go Christmas shopping! Yay!
