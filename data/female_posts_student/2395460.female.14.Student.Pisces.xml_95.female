While  urlLink much more impressive camera phones are around the corner, the 1.3 MP 8920 will be a marked improvement over what is availableon cell phones today. You might actually be able to make decent small prints with this. The phone also has a built-in flash, a timer for those self-portraits, and an 8x digital zoom (not a real optical zoom, it's just in-camera enlargement) as well as a macro mode . It's a decent phone too, with a built-in speaker and almost 6 hours of talk time (with 10 days standby.) All this and it's tiny, under 4 0z.    The phone is $300, but new customers to Sprint PCS are eligible for instant rebates up to $150.    Read  urlLink CNET's review .
