Actually, the funny part is when you do realise.  I'm talking mutual recognition here. Like..when you brush up against someone or talk to someone. The one that gets me the most, though, is when two peoples' eyes meet. It could be purposely or accidentally, willingly, or not. Whatever the reason, or lack thereof, it happens all the time.  Forgive the cheesy names, but for example:  Little Tommy could be looking Little Dorothy in the eyes, telling her how lucky he is to be with her. Of course, he was staring at Little Cindy's ass five seconds earlier, but that's completely not the point.  Or...  Bored Student could be optically wandering the room while Mr. Tohkaloht's voice sings on without her. Longing for something to indulge in, Bored Student's eyes wander up to Tired Student's eyes, and for a moment, their eyes lock. Bored Student is also a victim of Social Anxiety Disorder, so the moment is not quite a moment, but a quarter of a second.  Or...  Suzie could be sitting in her room, thinking about why she had re-decorated the newly painted white kitchen walls with landscapes of greem and orange crayon. Hr cat walks in the room and stares right at her. Suzie takes this as a sign that it's time to play Princess Fluffy, and pulls out her doll clothes and nail polish.  What about...  Ms. S could be in a black-walled chamber with Mr. M. She smiles as she looks at him, his arms chained to the wall, and she takes out a whip.....You know what? We're gonna skip this one...  Well, I was thinking about what is actually going on when people's eyes meet.  By my looking you in the eyes, I would sort of be recognizing your existance, while at the same time, you're recognizing my existance and the fact that I'm recognizing yours. I'd recognize the fact that you'd recognize the fact that I was recognizing your existance, and...  Restrain yourself, Maddie. New paragraph.  ...you'd...  Now.    Anyway, it's pretty cool. It's like...for that that moment, however long it may last, both people are kind of reading each other's minds. They're kind of thinking the same thing, and they both know it.  (You know the 'they'...those people we always talk about, but never see?) They  do  say that eyes are windows to the soul...
