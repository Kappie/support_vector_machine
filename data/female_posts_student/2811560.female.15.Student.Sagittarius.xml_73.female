And we weren't wearing the same shirt like we did last week, so that was a plus. I have band tonight, boo. Really don't want to go. Oh well. Just band tonight, babysitting tomorrow and then Catchstone concert! I'm super duper excited for that. It should be really fun. Its close, and they have a 2 hour set. Its gonna be one big party, lol. I have to go get ready for band now. Boo!
