And for all the garbage I have put him threw I am sorry, profoundly sorry. I do find it easier to write than speak. I don't know why, but thoughts just flow better in more concise and clear manners when put in text instead of arbitrarily spat like tobacco, usually misread and harmful involuntarily. At any rate, there will be no way of truly telling him how I feel for him. My feelings are as strong as they can possibly be. I have never been able to fully trust someone the way I can with him. He makes me feel at ease as he talks about "us" in the long term..which is stranger than fiction the way things are these days. It's one thing to know that sex isn't going to happen until we engage in a binding social contract and enter an institution, but to make me feel like it's the right thing to do, makes him special. When he lets me tell him all the insignificant goings-on of my day and takes the most genuine of interests makes him special. The way that every story I tell that makes me open up old wounds, he understands my tears makes him special. Putting up with me not seeing these things, makes him special. There are countless other reasons why I am lucky to have him in my life, but these are the ones that have been floating in the sky which is my head like hot air balloons traveling around the world. And for what it's worth.. I think that with Robert I can put my guard down and let him in... which is so difficult.
