Then I drove the SHO there WITHOUT STALLING and met up with Caitlin Eckenrode and her mom. We threw some stuff in their trunk, went and got water, and then headed down to the field. It was great to be around a bunch of girls with hockey sticks again, even if half of them didn't know how to hold it :) Everyone was good by the end of the session though, and I even learned maybe half of their names! That's an amazing feat for me, by the way. I suck with names. Anyway, then Jos√© and I went and biked 15 miles on the rail trail... and now my butt hurts. It was nice though, and I did have the padded, bouncy seat, so I shouldn't complain. By the time we got back to Indian Rock's parking lot we were starving, so we drove over to Subway and lo and behold - Matt and Justin were there! Amazing! Matt entertained us with his talk show host banter and such, and the three guys got to drool over some "hot" "girls" who walked in. Mmmhmm...  Now here's the annoying part of my day. I was actually going to go to York Arts, being the very civic duty minded girl that I am. Except I didn't. But I tried really really hard. Joe drove me down, but construction sort of impeded our way, so he dropped me off at the corner of Beaver and West Market. I tried to walk down Beaver to the York Arts building, but was stopped by this annoying construction dude, whom I'm sure had nothing better to do than make people's life complicated. He told me that I couldn't walk down the street, and that I should walk around the block and come up the other way. Uh huh, yeah. I walked around the block, and came up the back way... which made no sense because there was more construction down at that end. So I walked up to the YA building and kinda peered in the windows and knocked and stuff. Eventually someone caem and told me that they had left already. So I'm like "Shit." and walk back up the street to where Joe had dropped me off, and called him to tell him to come back and pick me up. By now they've opened the street again, and people are walking and driving down it. That alone pissed me off. Then, this ghetto kid on a bike rides up to me and calls me "One hot bitch" and wouldn't leave me alone. I think if it had been dark or there had been less people around I would've kicked him off the bike or something and started running. He was creepy, and kept circling me. Finally, Joe calls and tells me to come meet him on Beaver again... and that the YA people were walking down the street. By this point I'm just like wtf and screw this I'm going home. So that's what we did. And Jeopardy made things better. Heart Jeopardy.  Then Mom made us dinner, we went to Weis to get good (albeit crazy expensive) Starbucks ice cream, and we watched Star Trek: Nemisis. Joe has Laura and me hooked on Star Trek now. It's both sad, and cool. Heh.  Gotta get up early for hockey camp again.  Cool.  :)
