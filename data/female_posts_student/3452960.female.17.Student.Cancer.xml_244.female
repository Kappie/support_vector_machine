(Entirely rhetorical. Don't answer.)  Rob told me to blog. So I am.  Look! Blog! Isn't that great?  What's going on then? Tomorrow, I have an "Industry Day", where I get to spend the whole day in school doing... Hell, I don't even know what it's meant to be. What a load of shit. What's that Mr. Mathieson? I just suffered the most boring week of my 6th form life and now you're telling me I have to do even more shit? Thanks a fucking lot.  What else? I'm bored. I had a bacon sandwich earlier on. I liked it.  What else? I had some skittles earlier too. They were also nice.  What else? Somebody phoned me lots of times. And my house too. If you wish, I will tell you the number and you can see if you know who it is. It is very disturbing.  What else? I have induction training at Waitrose on friday. That should be fun. Once I start, I will be on Â£3.90 an hour, thursday and friday nights. Plus, if I do overtime I get more money. PLUS, if I work on sundays I get "time-and-a-half", meaning I get all the money I earn that day plus half again, in case you didn't know.  Anything else? No? Good. That's quite long enough. Congratulations for surviving my post. I like them long, as you can tell.
