We left Wednesday and were at the work camp until Saturday morning and then we went to Bluff Falls Water Park all day. I've had sooo much fun these past few days. I've met a ton of new people and got to know a bunch of people that I already knew a lot better. It was so much fun. Its going to take me a few days to remember all the fun stuff that happened.Let's see, on day 1 we got set up in our rooms, met our work crews, figured out what we'd be doing, etc. In my crew there were 6 people counting me. Two adults, Bridgette from Florida, and Mark from Nebraska. Then there was Kelsey, she was going into 8th grade and was from North Dakota, Jordan, he was going into 7th grade and was from Kansas and Robert, who was going into 9th grade and was from Oklahoma. We got an assignment to work at an elderly man's house on a job. His name was Leonard and he had parkinson's disease and was the sweetest old man. He asked us if we believed in guardian angels, we said yes, and he was like "well me and my wife think that you're our guardian angels." We finished his job by like 1:30 that day so we moved onto working with crew #40 that Jess G. was in. I was so glad to see someone I knew! Her crew was awesome and we spent the next day and a half having a blast painting a house. These past 5 days I will never forget. But right now, I'm in pain because of my lovely sunburn so we're going to have to take a break on this.
