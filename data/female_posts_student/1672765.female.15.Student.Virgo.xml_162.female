I really hate myself when I do it. And I always do it.  I actually said something to my family that I think I had a problem. I think they think I'm kidding. I mean, come on. I actually tryed to talk about a problem I had to my FAMILY. This is not something I do often and they practically blow me off.   Whatever.  I came up with a plan last night but I broke it this afternoon. I'm so stupid. I hate this.   Though it's not that big of a deal I guess but I hate it so much that it is a big deal to ME. It's not healthy either... I was looking something up about similar problems on the internet and it was saying it is a problem and everything and that anybody who said "yes" to three or more of a series of questions should get help (therapists and stuff) and I answered yes to way more than just three.  So anyways, I don't want to go to a therapist or anything because I know exactly what they are going to try to get me to do and I don't want that at all so I know I need to help myself. I have my plan I just have to stick with it which is the hardest part.  I need something...that'll help me stick with it...I can't think of anything though. I'll have to really come up with some sort of help.    In other news. I'm so out of this fight. I'm getting out. I have to get out. "Into the darkness is where you're dragging me and into the dark is where I never want to be."  That came to me just now and it's how I feel.  I've never really been in this situation before and it's an awkward one and I want to badly to get out and not be in it but there's that one thing that keeps pulling me in, making me stay. I hope it blows over because I hate it.   Something else I'm avoiding too... I'm doing a pretty good job of it too *knocks on wood*.
