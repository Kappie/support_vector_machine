We lose as much to life as we do to death. -Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey, 'A Woman of Independent Means'  Nothing is as far away as one minute ago. -Jim Bishop   My goal for tomorrow: Find the perfect book.  I don't want a book with words on the pages, but pages and pages of nothingness.  I have never owned something bound and substantial for the express purpose of writing.  I have jotted in spiral notebooks, typed on this blog, even stood in a boathouse and written on the walls in paint, yet none of that is permanent.  Those things are meant to fade overtime.  I want a place to store profound thoughts, some that might even be my own, mainly borrowed wisdom.  I change every moment that I breathe and what I value changes too.  I want something that reflects that, that mirrors my progression.  So tomorrow I will take the first step in that and try to find a book that I am willing to commit to keeping.  It will most likely be simple, something that I hope to become.  I doubt I will find it but we shall see.
