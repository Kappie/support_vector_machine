I have never stayed up all night, but I probably will tonight. Bill has Lee over, and I can't get to sleep. I've tried. I'm still trying to find a Blog Skin for my other Blog, the private one that nobody is going to read. I dont even think that anyone reads this one..hehe. I hope not, but Oh well.   Things are shitty between Ashley and I. I feel so akward around her now, and its like..I dont know. It's just so weird. We really have nothing to talk about anymore, and it seems like once again I am pushing everyone away. Not saying that's neccessarily a bad thing.   Hmm..lets see what happened today. Well..I went to school and then I went to Bills. Bill and I watched House of 1000 Corpses. Well, both of us fell asleep during it, but after that we watched a Rammstein DVD. It was excellent. They put on a great show, and are insanely talented. I never really liked them as much as I do now. Bill really does listen to amazing things. Odd...but amazing.   La la la..I have nothing else to say. I think either I am going to TRY and go to sleep, or I'm going to try and find a Blog Skin. Either way..I'm not going to be doing much. Goodnight I guess..even though I'm not really say that to anyone. hehe..so BYE BLOGGIE!
