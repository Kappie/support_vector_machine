I don't like him. He is arrogant, almost. I still find him attractive, and find myself staring at him during socials, but I mean, I always stare at the sexy people..o.O.   I used to think that Adam wasn't someone to pull at ye-olde heart strings. And he is. It's like a sudden bang, and I'm attracted to a new person.   I've had a dream. Me and him are swimming at Thetis Lake, my new favorite place, goofing off, and splashing at each other, riding on his back. Then we go off and lie on the beach for a bit, snuggling close to each other. It's a cloudy day. Slowly the night falls around us, and we are naked! swimming under the stars...  Damnit.....
