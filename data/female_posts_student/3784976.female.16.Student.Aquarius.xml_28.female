They wouldn't let me go t.p., and my mom's reason was:  She didn't want me out driving around late at night, and if I had to drive back by myself to meet curfew, she was afraid I would get a flat tire and I would be stranded all by myself.  But of course she  wouldn't mind if it was Ben because Ben is a boy, and I am a girl and apparently I can't stand up for myself as good as he could.  (I was like, "mom, have you checked out his muscles lately?  Well of course you haven't, there is nothing to check out!")  I am stronger than him, he is a twig.  I could snap him in half.  Anyway, this morning Ben came up to me and asked me if I enjoyed not going T.P.ing last night, in a real smirky tone.  Buttminch!  Haha.  I seriously crack myself up.   And now I really am looking forward to the end of the week because I really need that paycheck.  I just bought clothes from Hollister on-line and I need to pay my momma back now.  She'll just have to wait, now won't she?   Oh ya, now I am really confused, which doesn't happen that often, but you know.  First I thought Krystle was quitting, then I thought Amy was going to be fired, and now I read Kayla's blog and it seems like she might be quitting.  Well, you know, if anyone wants to help me understand this a little better....feel free to.  Ya, so now I am bored and hungry and I still don't know about Saturday night Nicole, but I will let you know as soon as I do know.    k-
