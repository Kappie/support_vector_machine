It had its ups and downs. first of all I was not in a very good mood today, but so lumpkin was talking and she just made me mad i dont think it was what she was saying it was how she said it i guess, anywayz so she was talking to us while we were at attention and she put her hand on my shoulder. normally i wouldnt have cared, but for some reason it pissed me off.  so very nicely and calmly i brought up my left hand with my water bottle and just pushed her hand off, i didnt say a word, and i didnt break bearing!! i dont even know why i did it!!! i dont think she liked that!  oh and during the warm-up while i was taking pictures a sign came up and said "not enough available space" so i went and put it away cuz i would deal with it later. so as i was putting it away i remembered how it only had about 20 mins. left so i took it back out and plugged it in. so i went outside and did drill  then right before sports i ran inside to get the camera and it wasnt in the box!! i was freaking out! i looked all in the logistics room and i started to cry i was like "OMG i lost the camera, chris is gonna kill me." so i walk outside and Kayla's flight is re filling their water and i go up to kayla and i'm like " umm kayla have you seen the camera" her eyes get real big and she is like " you lost it" and i'm like i " might have misplaced it" then she was like go ask chris somebody might have used it. so i double time it over to the volleyball net and chris is giving instructions so i wait, then he comes down off the ladder and is like what and i'm like " umm Jordan i dont know where the camera is" he starts screaming " what? where is the camera" it was horrible cuz then amy heard him and is like "you lost the camera"  so chris  starts just going over with me where it might be, and then i am like "oh i know where it is i plugged it in to recharge it!" chris was like go and get it! I thought he was pissed. it was a simple mistake anybody could have done the same thing!
