Nooo... im gonna miss it =(  Unfortunately played in the semis on saturday and lost 2 nil. I swear we were kicking their asssses all da way to timbucktoo in the first half, grrr i dun wanna talk bout it, it jus makes me mad. So that was the last game we're gonna play as a team cuz we're losing Beck and Jenna next year. Y do u have to be in year 12?! nah i'm kiddin... its not ur fault ur old =) We'll miss ya HEAPS!!!  Overall it was a great season, finishing 3rd ain't bad guys!! a whole lot better than last year... haha 'challenge cup'?? we didn't even win it!! We'll be even betta next year. Jus like the Hockeyroos!!! Can't wait til the hockey dinna, be there or be square.. whatever that means...  Today at skool was fun. Hip hop was mad, everyones getting betta and betta. Haha we're gonna burn da floor at the senior dance, which u girls ARE going to!! After that was lunch. We spent it inside the Campbell hall cuz it was coooold outside. Luckily the piano was there to keep us entertained! Being the Brady bunch family we are, we had a group singalong round da piano. Corny, i know, but who cares its fun!!! Sorry i ran outa songs to play, write me a list of 'special requests' n i'll learn them for ya. Newaiz halfway through Louise got all sad. She started to thinking bout how things would be like 2 years from now, i think... where would we all be? Would we still talk n act like total retards together? hey i could be wrong. Either way dun be sad babe!! There are many more cold, wet lunchtimes to come =)  newaiz hope u like the pictures!!! i'm off! - luv ella
