I don't want to talk about it with anyone in my house because I don't want to bring depressing feelings out even though I know everyone's thinking about it. I'm just scared I'll get upset at school. I mean, it's one thing to cry when no one can see you, but when people are all around you. Oh well, I'll just try to keep it all bottled up. Haha, that's what I always do. I honestly think that's the best thing to do sometimes, well, for me at least. Oh well, whatever happens will happen whether I want it to or not.  On a happier note though, I went car shopping tonight. I think I'm getting a VW beatle. It kind of depends on stuff, but I'm almost positive that's the car I'm getting. Pretty neat. It will be nice to be able to drive and not always ask everyone for rides.   I'm not feeling so great right now...
