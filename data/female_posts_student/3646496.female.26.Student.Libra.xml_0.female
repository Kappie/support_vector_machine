It seems that she has had a hard shake at life and she always complains about her illnesses.  Everytime I come into work, she uses me as a sounding board to dump all of her problems on and in a way I feel bad for her, but then there are times when I just want to hide from her. Anywho...enough about my boring job! Today is the first day to vote in Canada!  I am very excited about this years election.  I encourage everyone to vote!
