     
       Two women of dramatically different social, economic, and ethnic circumstances find themselves locked into a bitter child custody dispute in this emotionally powerful drama       Jessica Lange  at her very best in this strong drama from 1995, a year after her Oscar winning performance in ‘Blue Sky’. ‘Losing Isaiah’ also stars Halle Berry in one of her better works of the early- and mid-nineties, though the experienced Jessica Lange overshadows her.   The moral  dilemmas and questions of wrong and right is one of the key features in this film that never received great reviews when it was released, which comes as a surprise when one watches the heartbreaking scenes when Lange and Berry battles for the custody of Isaiah.
