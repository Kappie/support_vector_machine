Michael was working, and he basically hung out with us the whole time. it was so much fun. i miss tara. and i miss michael. i love them both with a passion. i wish tara could hang out with me... thats so sad. almost ridiculous, actually. but whatever. people will be people, and i will be the scapegoat when there is no other. anyway, all the other Carino guys were working too. it was good to see them all. im going to put my application in today. last night Eli was introducing me to the manager David and he was like, "i know who she is. she didnt turn in her application." haha. so im going to do that today. i'll make sure to give it to David himself. lol  this morning mason was having a really hard time with how he was feeling... so my mom stayed home. which i doubt i'll be able to leave because she "needs help". we'll see. i hope mason gets better soon. im sure he will, but this isnt soon enough. its been 6 days now. my little boy...  its official, aaron is a jerk. love the kid to death, but he is a terrible, terrible person. haha. ask no questions.   well so she'll stop bitching, im off to clean the bathroom. what a wonderful day i have ahead of me.
