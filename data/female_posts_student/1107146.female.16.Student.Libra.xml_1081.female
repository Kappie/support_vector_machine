And if I did ever break up with Linds, She'd kick my ass. (not like I have any plans anyway)  I take it from some of the posts that Leigh Anne is the manipulative b**** of the group.  We've got some of those in Indiana.  I heard one girl say that she liked this guy, but he had a girlfriend already.  Her friend said, "That's not a problem, I can show you how."  Isn't that what friends are for?   Will sounds like my kind of guy, except for the soccer part.  Our football coach swiftly kills any word of a soccer team, and for good reason.  The former rival school added a soccer team, their football teams's record last year was like 1-10.  Hey Linds Why does that have to be a rhetorical question?  Maybe you'd better email me that answer................................................ Oh, and which one of your hmm, good friends, shall we say, told you to break up with me for April Fools?  That is the definition of medieval torture.  Love you too.
