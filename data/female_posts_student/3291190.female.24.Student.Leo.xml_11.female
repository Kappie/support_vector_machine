I will always be alone with those memories. I know what it feels like to be on the other side. To have shit taken away from you  to see things that are fucked up happening. Its like you are so powerless. I should have known not to watch that movie. I should have known that it would have disturbed me. I lay there  tried to talk to Evan about it, but he started to fall asleep. In that moment I felt more alone than I ever have. Its strange how you can lay next to someone  feel like you are a million miles away.
