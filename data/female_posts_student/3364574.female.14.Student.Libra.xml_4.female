I keep giving in but I should know better ‘Cause there was something ‘bout the way you looked at me And it’s strange that things change But not me wanting you so desperately  You looked me way and said, “you frustrate me” Like you’re thinking of lines and times When you and I were you and me We took our chance out on the street Then I missed my chance And chances are it won’t be coming back to me  Oh why can’t I ignore it? I keep giving in but I should know better ‘Cause there was something ‘bout the way you looked at me And it’s strange that things change But not me wanting you so desperately So desperately  Oh why can’t I ignore it? I keep giving in but I should know better ‘Cause there was something ‘bout the way you looked at me And it’s strange that things change But not me wanting you so desperately  I want you so desperately I keep giving in but I should know better I keep giving in but I should know better So desperately I want you so desperately
