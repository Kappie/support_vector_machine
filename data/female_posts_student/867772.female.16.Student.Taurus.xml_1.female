The only question is, where does it exist? In the physical world? In knowledge, or an idea, shared with others or kept to ourselves? In the cyberworld? Now I have a question. Where does happiness exist? Can we truly be happy, or do we only believe we can, making it real to us?   "...We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men were created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalieanable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness..."  Notice how they said "the pursuit of happiness", implying that you may never actually be happy. Is there actually a point of complete happiness and bliss, a point where you believe you couldn't ask for anything more? Or is there one thing someone might want, that dominates all other things, and if that one wish was granted to that person, nothing else would matter? If this IS true, wouldn't you think that the less a person cares about, the happier they would be? The people who don't care about much are usually labeled as unhappy people. Maybe this is because their one wish is so hard to grant, that they will never reach the point of total happiness.  "Ignorance is a bliss."  The less you know, the less you want. The less you want, the greater your chances are to be happy. This way, you don't have to give up what you truly want.  Everyone wants. If you ever find someone who is entirely happy, and wouldn't change one thing about their life if they had the chance, please introduce me to them. Please.  Unless it's not worth it. Unless you figure there's no point in wanting anything but what is. But...who doesn't dream....?  Love you all. Goodnight.
