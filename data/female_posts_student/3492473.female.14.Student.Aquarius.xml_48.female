Not to sound bitchy, but for once, everyone else has problems and I'm okay.  Most of the time, I'm the one with the issues.  It's kind of nice to have the roles reversed. I have a goal for myself. I have to read onechapter of Lord of the Flies each day. So I should finish Thursday but if that fails, myother goal is by Saturday. Then I get to spend  the rest of my summer reading  Tom Sawyer. Oh joy! Gosh,  school is coming up so quick.  It's almost August. Isn't it all crazy? In ways, I'm super excited for high school. In others, I'm super frightened. Everyone is gonna change and I'm worried it's gonna be  for the worst.  I'm concerned people will make the  wrong choices  and bad shit will happen...  I worry too much...  Oh and you wanna know something? I think it's funny how I always give people such amazing advice and then when it comes to me, myself, needing advice,  I don't even take my own advice.  How screwed up is that? Well, I already know I'm one crazy chick. New topic... I got the Ashlee Simpson CD. It's cool. I like her. Sorry to you people out there who think she sucks and she's only famous because of Jessica. You're entitled to your opinion and I'm entitled to the same thing. Well, it's 12:25 am and I need to shower and shave and finish reading Chapter 7 of LOTF and do Mark. orders....  Exciting how I spend my nights huh?  Well Annie called me tonight and we were talking about stuff. Then she asked, "Why didn't you go to Chris'?" me: "I was reading..." I have no life! Well, sweet dreams! I hope everyone's problems turn out okay! And as usual, I'm here for advice, someone to vent on, or just someone to listen! Happy Birthday's go out to Kevin Dowd and May Vigil!
