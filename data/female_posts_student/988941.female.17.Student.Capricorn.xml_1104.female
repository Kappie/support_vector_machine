And in general studies Max and I made a very sucessful presentation about it all. We came second in the polls. We voted for the communisits. I say send them to France simple because France - I dislike. Thats not a decent reason to say that I know but hey, thats me. Like I say before, I don't know that much about it all. I don't mind the seekers who happily pay there way and live quietly without causing problems. Thats fine. I understand about war countries and goverments pursuring people and stuff and yes its horrible for them which is why I say with the amount we'd save on the illegal ones being kicked out we could help those countries. Thats also a better way than sending in our army like Iraq. But hey, I don't really know what I'm talking about. I don't know all the ins and outs. I have no need to know really. Only time it bothers me is when I'm in Croydon and they're all around and its like ah get away. Yea, I guess what I'm saying is we should send the illegal immigrents away somewhere, anywhere, else and find another way of helping them.  Tomorrow  Jo  will be choosing subject/question.
