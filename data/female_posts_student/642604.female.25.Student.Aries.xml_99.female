Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends, as for phrophecies, they will pass away, as for tongues, they will cease, as for knowledge, it will pass away. For our knowledge is imperfect, but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child, when I became a man I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood. So faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love." ~1 Corinthians 13:4-13   "I think I can, I think I can...." ~The Little Engine That Could   "Spiders are not insects, they're arachnids. Insects have 6 legs, spiders have 8. Also insects sometimes have wings antennas, spiders don't. Which is good because flying spiders with bobbily antennas would be frickin way scarry!" ~The oddtodd.com website   "I saw Geraldo reporting from Afghanistan. He was wearing rose tinted sunglasses and a blue neckerchief in a very successful effort to look ridiculous." ~The oddtodd.com website   "It's like the wind, I can't see it, but I feel it... I feel wonder and beauty, joy, love, I mean it's the center of all things...." ~A Walk to Remember (the character of Jamie on Faith)   "Of all the lessons I have been fortunate to learn, the single most powerful, most important one is: Hate No One!" ~ Dave Pelzer    [ Fri Jul 12, 12:03:04 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] AHHHH!!!   So last night on the way home from the gym I'm starving and thinking that I cannot wait to cook my vegitarian pizza so I decide to just swing by Burger King and grab a veggie burger. I order it plain, no cheese, we go through all the motions of repeating it back to me so that I've made sure the order is right and then I pull up to the window. I check the receipt, vegi burger, and I begin to drive off. The thing is hot, which would make sense since they had to make it plain and that always requires them to cook it on the spot, so I wait a few minutes before unwrapping and starting to eat. I didn't pay ANY attention to what I was eating, I put my faith in the fine employees of Burger King... BIG FREAKIN MISTAKE!!! Bastards that they are had managed to not only give me the vegie burger the way I ordered it but they DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME AT ALL. I had taken two bites and was like, something isn't right, so while driving on 66 I open up the sandwich to realize that I had eaten MEAT! RED FREAKIN MEAT! AHHHHH! I'm only like five minutes from home but I just begin to freak out completely, images of dead cows in the slaughterhouse come back to me and I can't seem to gain control of myself. I throw the rest of the sandwich out of the window, by the way my apologies to anyone it may have hit, and then drive at lightening speeds to my house. I then fling open the front door, run inside and quickly learn how to be bulemic (sp?), okay well that's a lie since we all know I've gotten good at making myself throw up when I drink too much... BUT DID YOU ALL KNOW THAT IT'S HARDER TO THROW UP WHEN YOU'RE NOT DRUNK! Oh it was way too gross, but I got it all out. I think I actually got it all out and then some. I don't how people make themselves throw up on a regular basis, I still hurt from it... my throat, my stomach, this all reminds me of when I had that messed up stomach virus for three months straight and couldn't keep anything down, but at least then I wasn't MAKING myself do that... my stomach decided to do that all on it's own. So finally I get it all out, I jump in the shower, I feel absolutely disgusting and not just from being at the gym, from the idea that I ate meat, and then proceed to not only use mouthwash, listerine tabs, and brush my teeth six times over but I drink salt water and gargle it. I think I'm finally recovering now but it's been over twelve hours since I ate it... I then proceeded to eat a piece of pie and was starving again by like midnight last night, woke up hungry, have been hungry all day, and still shiver every time I think of it. All of this because of some damn employee at Burger King who is either an idiot or did it on purpose to be funny... I SO WANT TO CALL THEM AND REEM THEM OUT! BASTARDS!
