Well I've almost finished assignment #1 - i've written the 3000 words but haven't quite finished what I want to say! I am going to see my tutor about it on Tuesday. Have started assignment #2, so it's all going to plan at the moment.  Feel like summer is on its way. We've had 2 good days now and on Friday I even let the kids have the water tray outside! The kids took off all of their clothes and paddled in the 3 inches of water!  Paul and I had a deep discussion about how we mustn't waste water because of the many people in the World who don't have water.  He got very frustrated when I said we lived in England though - insisting that we didn't live in England, we lived in Birmingham!!  Have just been to a concert Lizzy was singing in - it was really good.  I especially enjoyed Carmina Burana (?spelling?) it is so passionate and emotive.  I took my journal and sat drawing and writing throughout - the lady next to me didn't look too impressed but who cares!  I can think really clearly and rationally when listening to music like that.  I've decided that tomorrow I'm going to go into town and go to the coffee shop - was going to go today but was rather sweaty this morning after playing basketball (even worse (sorry Melanie going to gross you out again - it wasn't my sweat - but James'!! I fell on him and got covered in it! urgh yuck!) I'm going to take my book and spend Sunday afternoon there - what a great way to spend a Sunday! Shame I can't take my card making stuff with me too. How cool would that be? A coffeeshop/second hand bookshop/card making place all in 1!! (Apparently I am always using double punctuation according to Katelyn - sorry!!)  It's the Eurovision Song Contest here tonight - have you heard of it in Canada? Did you know that Celine Dion won the Eurovision Song Contest once - for Switzerland!!!  Not quite sure how she managed that (both to win and to represent Switzerland) Don't know who has won this year though. The UK used to do well, but as with most things, we don't anymore.  Ok, well I think I've redeemed myself with bloggage - your turn guys......
