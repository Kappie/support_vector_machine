I was at a friends birthday party, and my best friend was tackled by another friend of mine, and we had to take her to the hospital because she hurt her knee, it turns out she was just being a weeny, they did x-rays and all that and it turned out it was just bruised, they gave her pain killers and told her to ice it for the next few days. She's fine though she's even going out to Denny's in a few minutes. I was going to go to the hospital with her, I called my mom to tell her, and my mom said no, and then I got pissed and left mt friends birthday party and went home, only to get in a huge fight with my mom. Not fun. But things are okay now. So I called the kid who tackled my best friend to let him know that she was okay and to not feel to bad. Well he knew because they went back to the party (yeah, I know weeny). And I think he tried to ask me out on a date. My best guy friend in the world, just tried to ask me on a date. It's okay that I'm weirded out yeah? He asked me what I was doing tomorrow, I told him nothing, then he asked me what I was doing tomorrow night, and I said nothing (curious as to where he was going with this) and then he asked if there were any movies out that I haven't seen. I told him i didn't know (completely freaked out by this point in time) and then he asked if I wanted to go see Alien vs. Pretator with him tomorrow. I asked who all would be going and he said just you and me...That's not normal for me and him, yeah we hang out one on one, but we never just call each other up and then go see a movie with each other...A question for all the guys out there,   did I just get asked out on a date by my best guy friend?     -Confused in Washington
