Everyone works and works, generally undesirable and drab jobs, to get by in the world, yet when do we take time to stop and smell the roses?  If all we do is work, when do we enjoy the fruits of our labors?  If all we do is spend sun-up to sundown droning around mindlessly hating our lives, when do we take a moment to enjoy the better things in life?  All of these questions have occurred to me recently.  Perhaps its because my life has suddenly become terribly busy!  I just started school for the Fall Semester at  urlLink MCC  and I have been going endlessly for almost 2 weeks now, yet I have had very, very little time to enjoy the things I love in life.  I haven’t had time to pick up and book or work on my PbeM postings in weeks.  I go to class, work 15 hours a week at work-study, and study. Matt goes to class, works and studies. We run our errands, grocery shopping, cleaning our house, cleaning my in-laws house, sleeping less than 6 hours a night, and though it all when do we have time to enjoy our lives?  We only live once, I only regret that our lives are full of the hustle-bustle of “getting by.”  The average human life span is about 75 years give or take 10 years depending on your health, sex, etc. and we spend 55 – 65 years of that 75 years working.  We spend the best, most active years of our lives slaving away for someone else’s benefit.  All in all, I am less than enthusiastic about the prospect of life in the fast lane.    How can I neglect things I love, how can I deny myself enjoyment, how can I put my husband aside for a lack of time, how can I justify not calling my mom enough?  All for a crapy $6.50 an hour work-study job?  Life has grown gray.  When I move so quickly and neglect things I love everything seems to grow dark.    I suppose the largest examples are the fact that my PbeM group –to which I am one of the group leaders- has begun to fall by the wayside.  This activity involves writing for a “group-oriented story” once every two days or so, yet I can’t seem to make enough time for it and its something that I have committed myself to doing.  So life and all of its creepers have grown over my ability to actually live.    It begs the question: What the hell is the point of life if we never actually live?  ~Kristyn
