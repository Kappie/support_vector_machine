I studied for 30 minutes yeterday and said "fuck it, it won't help my grade" and I still know I did well. A wnderful feeling of  not  wasting time, for once. But now I am worried for Trigonometry, Spanish, and possibly Chemistry. I have a Trig grade right on the edge, so I am a little sketchy as to where it will end up going. *crosses fingers*  Raise the roof!!! (hey hey hey) I am having a major music lapse, you guys. I busted out the Jock Jams mp3s and CDs. Someone needs to buy me the Pulse CD. Haha, well, actually, that could cause some majoe brain damage. Eh, well, as if there isn't enough already.
