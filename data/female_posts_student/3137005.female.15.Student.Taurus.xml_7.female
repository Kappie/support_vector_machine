Hello once again readers of my blog, today's blog is dedicated to SUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Despite the Penguin above. Summer is here, well at least for this weekend it has been! Which of coarse means that I will (finally) be able to wear my summer clothes!!!!!!! Which I have way more of, though I'm still going shopping for more once I get some cash!  Anyways hmm time for my mindless babble section, today's topic is related to the overall one, Wasps. Arrg, who created these winged monsters, whose only aim is to interrupt my sunbathing by slowly alking across my belly like some kind of weird belly walking over thing. They are feinds sent by the devil himself, they're evil, I tell you, Evil!!!!!!!! Anyways that's quite enough of that for now, pasrtly because I have no idea what I am typing because I'm v.tired and have switched to automatic pilot mode where I babble e.t.c Which I'm proably doing now due to the distinct lack of punctuation, well there was a comma at least. Okay I'm gonna go to bed now, but not before I introduce my Guestbook, because nobody can leave messages here otherwise. oKay It's not working never mind. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Dani
