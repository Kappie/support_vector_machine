I also    didn't sleep    well last night. I went to sleep at   2 o'clock  , and woke up at   6 o'clock  . I woke up during various times in the night and had 2   weird dreams  . One of my dreams was about   my boyfriend  , I can't remember what happened exactly but I think we'd not seem each other in ages and then we just   split up  . Possibly to do with the film I saw last night, called   'Down To You'   with Julia Stiles and Freddy Prince Junior in it. I really fancy   Julia Stiles   when she's in 'Down To You' and    '10 Things I hate about you '  . I think she's just really   pretty .  I have a   Science   question; "   If Homosapians are homo's, Is that why they're extinct   ?"-Joey,Friends. Sorry about that, Just watching it right now. Erm, so anyway, I    didn't    Go to Town to be support for   Melissa   when she got pierced, I    didn't    hand in my   CV  , I    didn't    go to   Adam's  . Damn It hurts :(   Stupid   Stomach.
