Whereas I tend to pick apart people who I do not know well, I naturally shy away from looking objectively at my friends.  So in an attempt to do something about this I began to think and what I discovered is that there is no way for me to be objective.  We have all become bound together and no way to determine where one begins and another ends (I just wish I could put this all into words better).  We seem to all have a really special group friendship, and while there are loops and circles within it we are all interwound.  It's amazing how lately even my mood seems bound to the group.  I think somehow I am afraid to analyze those around me, afraid for my perceptions of us to change, but that is a thought for another night.
