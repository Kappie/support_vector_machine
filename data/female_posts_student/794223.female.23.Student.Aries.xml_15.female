I don't just really like a few songs, or even half a dozen--I love ALL of them.  Every single track is fantastic, and I could listen to them over and over and over again.  THAT'S when you know you've got an excellent CD.  Today has been my day.  I was running errands on campus until 3~turning in last-minute things for my Fulbright application, and processing my study abroad credits. (FINALLY! After an entire year, my Cuba grades are at last being processed!)  Afterwards I went to Texadelphia, enjoyed a sandwich and a Dos Equis.  Mmmmm...it had been so long since I'd had a good beer.  Then I treated myself to a bit of shopping at the Woman's Co-op on the Drag, and came home.  I'm floating around in my new Longhorn flip flops that are as comfortable as air, and listening to good music.  I'm going to watch Bill Maher tonight on HBO, go to bed early, and at last get a good night's rest.  I have had the longest and most difficult week ever, and dammit, I'm ready to enjoy some R  R, at least until later on this weekend when I have to take another Oceanography exam at ACC.  But that shouldn't be too bad.  I think I'll go take a nap :-)
