I ended up either getting pulled around or being left behind.. n_n;; I got this drawing there, but unfortunately it's missing right now, so yeah.. We got the idea to cosplay, but I don't know if we'll really end up pulling it off. Rivermaya was there. I'm going to buy one of their CDs on of these days. Anyway, when they started playing, (we were sitting on the floor) everyone just suddenly got up and left to watch. n_n;; I really felt like crap at that moment. And they were playing that song.. "Umaaraw Umuulan" (LT: Basically a song on trying not to be sad and how life is "sadyang ganyan") I couldn't exactly go and watch too; I didn't want to leave their things just  there . Especially because they bought this stuffed toy that cost 500 pesos. So when they came back, I just left. I really just couldn't take it.  We saw Imelda Marcos that day. She was inside this Japanese candy store. They wouldn't let anyone else in. She had like, 7 bodyguards? Ugh. Frick her. She should be rotting in jail, that old hag.  Afterwards we went to Camilla's house. Ordered pizza and watched Weiss: Gluhen. It was more like a violent soap opera where the person you vow to protect dies, you get used by the bad guy, and the old man you end up killing is actually your grandfather. And that was only the first four episodes. So yeah. Then I went home.  Anyway... I got thinking again. And guess what I started thinking about! Guys. Ugh. It's the file in my brain that reads: "Don't Open". But stupid little me; I obviously don't know how to read. I got to thinking about it because of out junior prom.. which is only one month from now. crap. Well, my friends all have dates, so they said I should have a date too, because they'd be busy with their dates. And I wouldn't be busy at all. But unlike them, I don't know a whole class of boys or have a kuya or even have a partner from our interaction. I don't even have a guy text mate. Tuh! The last guy who text messaged me text me for only half a day and never text back. So yeah. My social life with the opposite sex is very happy. Actually, I'm having second thoughts on going to the prom. I mean, I'd only end up being 'the pretty little wallflower' like my mom says. That's what happens to all the occasions I go to. Besides, if I don't go, I won't have to buy a dress. I could just give my invitation to a classmate (who's bringing two dates) and she could just pay me back.  The whole prom seems like such a hassle now.
