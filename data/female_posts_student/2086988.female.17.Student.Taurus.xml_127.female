Get up, tan if it's sunny, go to practice from 1:30-3:30, come home, watch some tv, pack and stay up all night. Then wake my parents up at 5am and leave at 6am...hehe they're going to kill me. But at least I warned them ahead of time :)   She's dying to survive Don't know what she's made of I would like to be that brave
