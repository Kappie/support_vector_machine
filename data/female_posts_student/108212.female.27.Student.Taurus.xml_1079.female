His name is ashley and he's eight. yup, that's how long he's been alive and i didn't know... he's one of the reasons i'm going back this pasko.   i was terribly stressed about it because i think mom knows, yet she didnt say anything. i dont wanna tell her aLtho she was asking if i "noticed" anything wyl i was there. yup... iono what to do about that. i did tell my sister, who could care less about my dad and the whole thing. i hate family secrets!
