It shows both how wonderful life can be and how hard it can be. It's so great. You should read it, everyone should read it.   ...Apparently some kid that recently graduated from our school killed his stepdad. That's just about all anyone was talking about today. The stepdad came into the kid's house or something looking for drugs. They got into an argument. And the kid stabbed the stepdad.... That's most of what I picked up... Here's the  article  on it. The way people were talking about it seemed like he killed him out of anger or whatever, but the article makes it seem more like self-defense, maybe. It's amazing how in 10 years this area can go from being a small, quiet, farming county to having murders almost daily -- I know, that's not a big deal to anyone from a city, but compared to how this area looks, it's shocking -- and finding bodies of people in rivers and along the Applachian Trail and C Canal and having some huge drug busts--not in some run-down house in the shitty part of town, but in the fooking parks!  ...Sorry, rambling wasn't I?...  Oh, A thunderstorm is beginning. :D Yay!
