It truly has been the best year of my life, mainly because of the freedom of a car and license.  I've been able to do so much more out and about with the car and for that I'm grateful.  This past year has also been one of great stresses and scares. Unfortunately some of my goals for the year didn't happen and I hope that they will soon.  So many thoughts and no way to express them.  When I was little I couldn't wait to be 16.  Sleeping beauty found true love, and i believe Cinderella too, at 16.  All of the cool kids on TV were 16 and they were all so happy.... Unfortunately the clock striking on my 16th birthday did not turn me into a maiden with long flowing blonde hair free to roam the woods and discovering I was a princess.  Neither did it bring along my prince charming.  What it did bring were new experiences and even better friends.  No matter how bleak I may seem at times I am grateful for such things and have loved this past year.
