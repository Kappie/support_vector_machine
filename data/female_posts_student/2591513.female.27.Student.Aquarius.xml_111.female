Despite the rationalization that these actions are done to scare countries into listening to them...but why do such barbaric acts?  Why anger the global community, why make your people look like savage beasts with no compassion...maybe that's why.  The world lacks in compassion.  I am not saying that America has a lot of it, maybe it has very little compared to other countries, but from the actions of the "terrorists" in the Middle East lately, it shows just how uncompassionate people can be, it doesn't matter what race.  Any one person that performs such horrendous acts do nothing but show their weakness in character and their lack of human compassion.  For it takes a dark soul and a person void of human decency to kill another person without regard...in a very ugly way too, through beheading.  I pray to God all this stops, but fear that the enraged "terrorists" will not stop even if foreign militaries leave the country.
