For god's sake man! If I walk past your table every five minutes to pour you more water, don't say "nah I am fine" 15 times and then two minutes later say belligerently "miss! can I get some water!" It is just rude, sorry. And for the love of god, if you need separate checks, tell me before I print out and bring the check. Is this really difficult to do or something?  ok I will stop ranting. (but really, it sucked.)  Seriously i am a better waitress then I anticipated. no really!   I miss my friends when I am working alot. that's the bitch about cell phones, when you are working, take a smoke break and check your voicemail, and you get  this  message:          "So, (insert any friend's name here) and (other friends}    are ,like, headed to (any random, yet cool, interesting destination). Wanna go?  To which my response is one of these three things:  1)sorry(random friend)no cash whatsoever   2)I wish, but it would take me at least two days to get there                       or  3)no response at all because i used up my breaktime listening to my voicemail           Such is life.  I am taking a mini vacation next weekend to the coast. Nothing fancy, just a little road trip. I will post some pictures for sure. I'm getting tired, and if you are still awake after reading this post, you must have had to much caffeine today.  And yet, she goes on ladies and gentlmen!   Please dont think you  have  to read this thing, i post mainly to keep my own journal, but you are welcome to read it.  Audience groans, why didn't you say so?

(Side note: if you are someone i dont know reading this, i am married to a copyright lawyer who is a bodybuilder and i have a dozen pitbulls.. with lazer guns on their forheads. ...oh yeah, and a moat with leeches and alligators.. with nightvision! yeah.)  Now that ya'll have read the disclaimer..   You are allowed to stop reading now, it can only get worse.
