You're the current Prime Minister of Israel, responsible for the killings of numerous Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli army and police forces, not to mention the illegal destruction of Yassir Arafat's HQ. But check this! You were also the Minister of Defence in 1982, when Israeli forces brutally massacred Palestinians in two refugee camps on the outskirts of Beirut non-stop for over thirty hours. Regarding your current actions against the Palestinian people, you recently said: 'In wartime, you don't have to expose everything to the world, to stand in public and reveal everything, in the name of that hypocritical and lie-filled concept known as honesty.' In other words, you're not going to say what you're doing, and you might even lie about it. Spoken like a true genocidal maniac. [People criticising Sharon and the Israeli regime are often accused of being anti-semitic. As intelligent people will know, a comment on a country is not the same as a comment on a race of people or a religion. Our criticism is purely political, and this test was written by someone with a Jewish background. We hate racism, and we thank you for not falsely accusing us of it.]
