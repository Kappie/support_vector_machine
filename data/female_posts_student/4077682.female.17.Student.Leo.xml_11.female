Today (technically yesterday) was an important day for me, and the one person I really wanted to see was my boyfriend. He had work in the morning, so we all went to jenns and swam in her pool, it was fun. But then later I didn't know what to do. I had it planned to go to my boyfriends house, and have a chill night with him, but when I finally talked to him, it seemed like he wanted to have some time to himself. I really would have rather spent the night with him. But I went to the fireworks. They were amazing, but I really wish I was with him, especially today.       Sometimes people are hard to read, or maybe I'm just super bad at it....? I dunno. It was just one night out of the whole summer, but its such a crappy feeling.
