I talk to Puff everyday and everytime it makes me miss Florida more and more.  Hopefully I'll get to see all my homies [Like Ana, Meghan, Amanda, Kristin, etc.].    In case you dont catch what I'm sayin, I need to get the fuck out of Ohio for a while.  Sorry all my homies in Ohio, but I gots to go.
