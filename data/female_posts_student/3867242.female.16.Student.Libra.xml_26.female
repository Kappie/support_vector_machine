Which is the first time since I had driving lessons awhile ago. I watched A 2 Z "Sixteen Candles"..and I must say that it was funny :). ANT even though I hated him on "Last Comic Standing" (not because he's gay..he's rude and annoying)..I loved his impression of Jim Carrey. Apparently, Jim Carrey was supposed to play Farmer Ted in the movie..but it ended up being Anthony Michael Hall instead. Anyways Rachael and I baked brownies. I wish I would do something with her today, but she's heading for work for awhile, plus it's Lucas's birthday and she's doing stuff with him later. So here I sit in front the computer with nothing better to do. Sigh...I have to work tommorrow..and Satuday..and Sunday. So I have a busy work weekend coming up. The Meadville Medical Center pinic is Saturday and I'm sure it's going to be a living hell! Sigh..I hate my life lately..but's that another story I just don't want to go into detail right now. I just hope that things will better soon..I'm sure they will..I'm just in a flipping stump right now. I think it's the weather gets better..I'll be happier...and when I finally get my linese..I'll be even more happier! But yeah..I'm alright..I'm just being a brat..so don't mind my constant complaining that I do quite often on this blog. I need to get to together with my friends soon. I haven't seen Rachel, M-dawg, Craig or Mike lately! I saw Daylin and Ashley on Sunday (see Kennywood!) and that was fun. Sigh again...this blog is going to be long since I have nothing better to do right now. Again much randomness and complaining about how my life sucks lately. Except my hair is better now..haha. Anyways another random thought..I want to see "Princess Diaries 2"..why you ask? I've read all the books..even the movie doesn't do the books justice..I want to see it. The first one was good and I'm sure the second will be better. I also want to see "the Village"..even though I am a wuss when watching scary movies (I remember Jodi grabbing me during "The Ring"..or Craig coming behind the couch at Mike's b-day bash during "Gothika")..so yeah you've been warned if you might see "The Village" with me. Alright..I'm going to shut up now..I must look for a backpack for school. Sigh..we must clear ones now thanks for a few dumb ass individuals that go to our wonderful school. Geez...I am swearing today..I'm sorry about that. I promise I'll do some praying after I get off the computer. See ya :)
