Are you ready? If not look away and scroll down to some of my boring stuff. There's plenty down there so you should keep busy! And now for the funny story:    The Day I Was Hit By Toliet Paper   Times were good back then, quiet and hardly any objects flying about this way and that. Jokes were being cracked here and there- mostly by me, and mostly about my brother. I was being annoying, I won't deny it, but I hardly think I deserved the punishment I would soon recieve from my mother. After I cracked one really good joke at my brother, my mom ran into the bathroom. Originally I thought that my joke had moved her to pee her pants, but I was horribly wrong. Little did I know that my mother was in the bathroom, armed with a roll of toliet paper, and ready to fire. I was unaware, so unaware. Out of nowhere a ball of pillowy softness flew towards me! I tried to duck, but it was to late. The sting of the pillowy softness hit me like a ton'o'bricks. "I been hit!" I screamed as I fell to the hallway floor. Shocked, I layed there until everyone stopped laughing.  And that was the day I got hit by toliet paper.   Other than that  I passed my driving class exam! Woo-Hoo! That means in-cars here I come. I can't wait... although, I hope I don't scare the instructor dude.    I have to go because:  I got homework to do, and I got to get ready for alex's early bball practice. (ACK THAT SUCKS!) This means I won't get to see cute basketball guy... *tear* it's so unfair.    Chow Ma
