Then you'd be in the gutter" "Then you'd read about me in the newspaper" "In what?!" "The death notices"  They apparently shut up after that.  But his rents have decided to take him out of school and make him work in their business to help pay off the $15,000 in fines/damages etc....oh and his car is getting repossessed. Yay for him.  I went and bought the ball tickets today, they are very flash....all professional and we get given little gold hearts that you can pin where ever you like. Woop.
