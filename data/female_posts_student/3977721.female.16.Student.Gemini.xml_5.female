Feel like want to cekik the person who put that song. Luckily they didn’t put that song last Friday. At least they played “The Reason”      Today band was fun. One of the instructor gave us a “new” instrument. It’s like one of those traditional instrument. You have to put it in ur mouth (disgusting! I wonder it went in how many mouth. I’m washing it with chlorine) and sort of pluck it. Don’t understand? Never mind. I also don know how to explain. All I know now is to make a different tune u have to “open ur throat”, that’s what the instructor said. How? Get a knife and cut it…. Just joking! We are to bring that instrument home and practice it. Toink toink toink……      I’m thinking of getting my motorcycle license. Too bad nobody in my family got a bike to lent me. Spity. It will be fun to be able to bike around. Ha ha ha….imagine me going to school with a bike…. So cho lo. By the time I reach school, my hair will be like a porcupine. Forget bout if first la.
