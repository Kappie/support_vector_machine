The other night I dreamed that I had finished it, and was dancing around in it while my sister took pictures for me to post here of the finished object. Maybe it was a sign that I will figure out how to put pictures on here? Anyway, it was a pretty good dream. Until a guy friend of mine, and his girlfriend, came over to my house and his girlfriend and I walked around naked and he got confused (that last sentence was a dream, if you happened to miss that part).
