Really missed them,esp the times when we all worked hard to prepare for the 'o' levels and everything else which happened in class. Wonder if they think that way too... Had been thinking about the many things which happened to me last year... Left the sch which i had studied in for 4 long years, spend lotz of time with my choir mates, having the SYF 2003 thingy whereby everyone cried so hard... Is it so impt that it will be in our memories forever, or is it just part of our life whereby we willl forget about it one fine day? I really wish to know the answer...
