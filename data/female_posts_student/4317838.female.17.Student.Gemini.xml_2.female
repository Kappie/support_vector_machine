Anyway, I'm getting to be a bit of a concert whore, it may not be apparent thanks to the serious lack of concerts but I think it's true. Since going to the  urlLink Space  concert at the  urlLink Academy 3  I've realised that concerts in smaller venues are absolutely brilliant! So no more M.E.N arena for me if I can help it. The past few months I kept checking the updates of  urlLink ticketline  to see if any of the bands I like were playing... But no... And then I check this week and  urlLink Keane  and Franz Ferdinand are on at the  urlLink Apollo ! Unfortunately Keane have sold out, but hey, Franz Ferdinand are far better, and I doubt I could convince Gordy to come all the way down here to see Keane :p    A bit of a gaming session was had today... I've been playing games on and off for a bit now, but not half as much as I used to. Now the  urlLink Gamecube 's in Ryan's room I seem to have decided to play it more. Must be the big TV and surround sound :p I started off with  urlLink Re0  which as I said in an earlier post, I have been playing anyway. From there I progressed to  urlLink Eternal Darkness  and got the past the bit I was stuck at :D Soon I'll have completed that fully :D Then I decided to restart  urlLink Skies Of Arcadia , as Mumbo had been praising it quite a bit the previous day. So there you have it, let's hope my gaming streak continues, I do quite enjoy it :p
