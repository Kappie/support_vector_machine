Why do people hit you with things that you arent expecting? I don't mean hit as in literally but you know, hit you with information that confuses you in the worst way and keeps you awake for ages at night. I'm really confused at the moment. I know I shouldn't be but I am. I don't know how to get rid of my confusion...thoughts anyone?  You get back to me.   Bunny Custard
