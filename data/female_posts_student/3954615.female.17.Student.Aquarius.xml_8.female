IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT I AM BUSY. there was no need to ask. *duo1 chi3 yi4 ju3* i have never seen such a dumb guy before. this is my first encounter with such an irritating guy whom i can't wait to get rid of. he is a thorn in my flesh. the sight of him irks me. if only i didn't get to this super smart class, i wouldn't have to meet all these weird people. my class sux to the max. it is so boring to be in this class. everyone is just not participating and not being enthusiastic.   and there is ms lim, forever giving me unnecessary loads of things to do. sometimes i really hate her, and i used that pissed-off voice to talk to her. i guess she is not very happy with me already. this lands me in a dilemma. i want to be a good and responsible chinese rep. yet i want to be part of my class. if i were to be on ms lim's side, the class would definitely hate me. yet on the other hand, if i were to be with the class and oppose to ms lim, (which i always wanted to), this would not do me any good. i still want my pearl's points. no matter what i am still the chinese rep. if i were to make ms lim detest me, things will be very awkward if she wants me to do something for her. she is actually not that bad afterall. i can understand her good intentions. but the class don't seem to be able to see her point of view. i have no idea why but it seems that chinese teachers are meant to be detested and hated. well.. the world is unfair isn't it?
