In the robot world, you are a bit of a lightweight in the colossal death league, but you do mutter "kill all humans" in your sleep - and after all, it's the thought that counts.

You're the right stuff.   urlLink     urlLink Which Colossal Death Robot Are You?    urlLink Brought to you by Rum and Monkey
