But at my age, there becoming a neccessity. I need ot get a job. Ive applied. Its been one day. So im applying at rite aid today. I need a car, but in order to have a car, i need to have my license, and in order to have my license, you guessed it, i need to know how to drive. All these things are starting to become neccessities in my life. Need a job for income so i can buy a car to drive myself places when my mom refuses to, but i need a license to drive, which leads back to the whole driving thing, which mom also refuses. Ive driven once. woohoo. I need more. So i just have all this on my mind today....blah blah blah....So you know what im saying right about now? "HERE YOU ARE, GOD, TAKE CARE OF THIS FOR ME." just have faith is all im saying. Another thing thats bothering me is that my report card hasnt come and i need to know my gpa and my final scores....THERE YOU ARE TOO GOD, DO THAT FOR ME TOO. hehe. FAITH>>>>>>   HAnging on to life by faith,  sam.
