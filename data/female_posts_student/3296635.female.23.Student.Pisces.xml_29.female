The UPSR takers are the twins (Akhbar and Abidin) and Fahmi (the 3 stoogies and believe me when the three get together alahai mcm nak pecah rumah) and da 2 PMR takers are Fatin and Syakir (yg ni pulak nampak ja pendiam but when they start to talk, non stop and syakir is da pak lawak guy...dah la muka cam Mr Bean)hope they excell in their studies and get good grades for da upcoming examinations...man..i miss studying,i miss da exercise books,i miss school life,i miss da sound of school bells,i miss taking tests(i never thought i will miss this part),i miss da blackboards and lots more but most of all i miss all my friends...lots of love..."pEAcE brOthEr"
