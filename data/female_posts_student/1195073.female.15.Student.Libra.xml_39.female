You just want to be loved.  You really value your friends and your family, but more than anything, you value your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/person you are stalking.  You don't necessarily value yourself very much, but it's ok because you will find someone else to value you.  Sad, but you're oblivious, so it doesn't matter.   urlLink Take the Which Led Zeppelin Song Are You? Quiz     That was always my favorite LZ song, so it's all good.  Besides, it's a little true right now.  I'll be posting with new Molly news later.
