But There is no way to do it, Cant let nobody know, But one day your going to have to let it all out no matter what you do, You have to yell it and maybe you can get on track, but again thats may never work, Your just a waiting time bomb just ticking waiting to pop. I know this is totally me, I have so much to say but never know when its the right time to say what I have to say. I wanna tell Jon, I love you, But thats just a waste of my time and words. He will never care like he used to!. Or Tell someone I have a huge crush on them and I cant live without talking to him, My live is better when he is around But I dont know if he feels the same, maybe I should just tell him howI feel. I will always be there for him no matter what! and To the person who dont know who he is I love you w/ all my heart and I cant stand not talking to you for a day!:)
