(cant have it all)  wow. school starts way too soon. how depressing. not to mention i dont have another job yet. crap.  adding onto my latest entry... dont always assume you know what im talking about. i have a lot of similar situations in my life, and you'd be arrogant to think you are safe in considering yourself correct in your assumptions. like i said... im vague. for a reason, i think.  not up to much today either. mom's not working so i dont have to babysit. but what else is there to do? i took a shower. that counts for something, right?
