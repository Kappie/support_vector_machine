I can write just fine (even better than some people i know, i dare say XD), but whenever I'm explaining something to someone (as, just now, with my knee problem and the GP) it all comes out as a lot of "like" and "ermm...uh". It's really embarassing, actually. So now I am resolving to get my conversation up to my writing standard ^_^
