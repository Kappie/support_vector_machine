When will Love be through with me?  Why live life from dream to dream? And dread the day when dreaming ends  One day I'll fly away Leave all this to yesterday Why live life from dream to dream? And dread the day when dreaming ends  One day I'll fly away Fly, fly away  "One Day I'll Fly Away" Moulin Rouge Sung by Nicole Kidman
