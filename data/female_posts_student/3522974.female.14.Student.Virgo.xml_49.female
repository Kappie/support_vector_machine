That just makes Mr Mackay more angry. Ellen go away,  FAR, FAR ,  away ! You too Roadkill, follow the devil,  just go, go out the door, dont turn around now, coz ur not welcome any more, u were the one who tried to make my marks go down, do you think i'd crumble? Do you think i'd lay down and fail? Oh no not I! I will reprogram! I will make you  self destruct  untill there is nothing left!  Well that didn't go with that stupid song but i just want it to hold Ellen's hand and walk off the side of the earth (if that is possible!?). I shall no longer be captain of this  N*E*R*D  squad who is made to make  killer robots . Hannah, wanna swap electives with me? I think you will find this class alot more  fitting . First period this morning, i swear it was humping my shoe like the lil chihuahua in  American Wedding .  It will pay . Meridith made it follow me around-something to do with the colour of my shoes, it is attracted to them.  Aaahhh!  I hope i dont have to see it again 2morro. It gives me the creeps. I hate picking it up! When i want to turn it off (thank heavens that is possible) i have to pick it up by the body (while it's wings and wheels are still moving) and press the button. I dunno, it sounds easy but (*literal chill down my spine*) i just can't, i can't.  Arghh!  I g2g.   Blogging off,  kCMai
