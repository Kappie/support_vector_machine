Oh wait a sec *plans to get high on lucozade and kidnap someone who can change the layout* Much better. :( The Real Big Fish / Goldfinger tickets are sold out! They're the best bands ever! *waaah!* Guess I'll have to go see Hundred Reasons instead *sigh* Ahh well, they'll rock my lame ass anyway. *or should it be arse?* Never really got that. Oh wait... I found the tickets! Yeay! Now I just need to get a lift there and back and money for a ticket... umm... anyone offering? Sorry, I've been reducing to shopping on the net cause I feel sicky and no one's here to throw up on! *mind you, if i was you reading this bright pink freak blog i think i would want to throw up on me* Go download some Jeff Buckley, you don't really need to resort to shoving fingers down your throat.
