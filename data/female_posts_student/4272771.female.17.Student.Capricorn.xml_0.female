It was just this tiny thing with traditional crafts and foods and then there was a stage set up with a few chairs in front. He bought me this really yummy soda (i forget what it's called...a weird porteguese name) i guess he used to drink it in the phillipines. But anyways then there was this band singing on the stage with a dancer in the front in traditional clothing. It was actually really good music i liked it! It was so fun because everyone that was there was mostly Brazilian so they were dancing up a storm practically everyone there was shimming their hips and jumping up and down and clapping. It was so alive. So we ended up being there like 4 hours just dancing and having a blast. Then since we had some time to kill and he knows I love Broadway we drove there and went to a little book store and just went around reading the funny books (since it was a quirky, whole-in-the-wall bookstore) It was just nice ya know? Nice and simple but so fun. I met his parents too that night. I have to admit that I was very very scared! I mean they are missionaries so i thought they would not like me in my little jean miniskirt and that they didnt like anything superficial and that they would be uptight and ah! It was just intimidating but they turned out to be actually really comfortable to me. I know that isn't usually a word used to describe people but that's how they made me feel I guess. So it all ended well and they goodnight kiss could have been my favorite part.
