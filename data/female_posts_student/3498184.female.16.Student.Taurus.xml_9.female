Today I wrote the longest thing I've ever written in Chelsea's yearbook... Damn it! My nose just started bleeding and my dad is taking a bath. FUDGE! Oh well, anyways. I think my longest one will be for Stina Tomorrow...I don't know when or where i'm gonna have time to write it, but hey. It's not gonna be too deep. It will have its deep moments though.  Well I'm avoiding my homework, so I better get to that. LATERz ~Bay
