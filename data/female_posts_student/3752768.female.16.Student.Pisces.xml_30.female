Atleast Iam actually making my own money and not laying on my ass all day bumming money from my parents..(I wont tell who that is directed toward...) Pizza jobs arnt for everybody... But anyways I got a new pair of ETNIS shoes they are soo cute.  Then we left at around 9pm and we went to eat. Ryan didnt go home til around 2am. It was an awesome day... I had fun.
