There are a great many changes that are taking place in my life. Tommorrow, I will become a mother to a tuxedo cat named Demeter. In two weeks, I will be starting graduate school, embarking on a life-long journey into the world of academia. My friend, Julius has joined the Navy and will be shipped off to basic training next week. Lots of changes.  So, this space is a reflection of those changes, the need to write and think beyond the traditional weblog, livejournal, or daily journal. This space will be composed of ideas, broad themes, academic pursuits, and the occasional antedote about graduate school and life, in general.  There will not be an archive section, because the purpose of this space is to write and live in the present and not rehash the past nor to dwell on the future.   Right now, I am walking in darkness.
