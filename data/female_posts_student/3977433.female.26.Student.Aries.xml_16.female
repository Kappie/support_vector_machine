Laura is stopping by this afternoon, and I'm thinking we might go for a walk, or a drive to the beach. That would be charming.  For now, I'm going to give Wish and Gus their baths. Then maybe, just maybe take a shower myself. Fuck I'm a pig.  ...But a beautiful pig.     just when everything was making sense. you took away all my self-confidence. now all that I've been hearing must be true. I guess I'm not the only girl for you.  but that's what I get.  why does it come as a surprise. to think that I was so naive.
