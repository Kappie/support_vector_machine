Don't think I'll ever be able to watch that movie without remembering that first night out.  Even watching it in the Pullman theater and now on the futon, still can't get passed that smell, taste, feel of London.  Random days of adventuring flashed behind my eyes as the movie carried on in front of them.  Making our way out of the house around 11 each morning, bracing against the winter chill of the Atlantic.  Wandering through Harrod's food halls and bookstore.  Feeling the stomach clench with emptiness as the shutter clicked, taking "such great pictures" of blurred celebrities.  Bumping around the white room each morning; turning in circles getting ready, hoping his towel and my hair would dry in time.  Only Starbucks tasted the same as it always does.  But it fit in perfectly in the new adventure.    And now I find myself missing it more than ever.  Sam's speech about the great stories will always do me in, but Aragorn's dream sequence with Arwen is what I end up remembering that I didn't want to forget.  He's accepted his duty/role, knows he will follow it wherever it may take him, but has no idea why or how he's going to pull it off.  Sounds very familiar.  And her reply is finally spot on.    And then there's Cate and her damn Galadriel.  If all the hype and that little place deep within us are to be believed, this third round will mirror just as much as the first two.  We won't be able to understand entirely how right away, but we'll have some idea.  We'll return forever changed, knowing the story's finally been told to its end and will carry on, almost as usual.
