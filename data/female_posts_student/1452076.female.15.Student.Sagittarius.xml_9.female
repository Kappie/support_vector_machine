And here is one of them:   urlLink My First Remix   It's nothing much, only 8 seconds worth of my fantasies, and some have already heard it before. A little short, but do enjoy and give comments. I think the remix factor injects a little more rock to this recording. It's not quite perfect yet, but I hope to improve my skills as I go along. And as if you don't find this jarring to your ears, more works will be up when I finally get my new acoustic (which will be a few months later), while others are still in the making. Sorry, no electric guitar clips until I figure out how to get a nice, clean sound amidst all the distortion.
