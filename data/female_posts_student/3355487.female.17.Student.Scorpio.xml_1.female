Yet when the person who is loved does not return the love that we express, when our love is unrequited, our love sometimes turns to hatred… We need to know what love really is in order to understand and truly love others. By doing so, we may heal ourselves and continue loving for it is by loving others that we find meaning and purpose in life. It has been said that no man is an island. We all love in order to have a reason to live… The first lesson is that you must know the ultimate thing that everyone seeks… love? no! not love but happiness.. So, if you want him to come back to you, you must have happiness within and he will come back for she will be seeking that which is within you- happiness… You must know that happiness is found not outside of you but within you... Try to detach yourself from your emotions. Remember always that the greatest love of all is to love yourself first for you cannot love others when you do not have it. Otherwise you will be just using the other person to make you happy. This is how we heal our heart. We use our mind to heal our heart… The next time you fall in love, know that you’ve nothing to prove to the one you love. There is only everything to express for love means that the love that we give to others is what we surely receive. We do not expect or demand others to give it back to us. Love is not blind. Love sees every shade and color of the light. When someone we love does something wrong to us, we should correct it in a constructive manner without anger or hatred and without the feeling that we are better than the other but because we know that it is the right thing to do. Love is about something, we give and express love to others simply because we want love in return. We want the other person to express love in a way that pleases us and makes us feel good... So, what should we do to truly love others? Let it begin within... love begins within ourselves. When we love others, we must be willing to set them free if and when they so desire. No one belongs to anyone. Each man has his own personal path to follow and a destiny to fulfill. We may be with each other for a short or a long while but in the end, we will leave everybody behind and move on our spiritual journey. What matters most is the experience of loving. Our life is simply the announcement that there is love in our hearts. This is the same reason why love eludes us when we seek it because we are absolutely sure we do not have it. We attract only that which we have and what we have is what we are. We attract every person that is in our life through our consciousness. What we are and we have within is what we will attract… so, if you want to attract a handsome, honest, and intelligent person, first you have to be the ideal that you desire to have and you will attract the kind of love that you are. To love others is not to use them when we are sad, lonely or depressed or when we are having a problem. To love others is to love them by being with them without demands and no expectations. When others do not return our love and goodness, let us not feel bad. Its spiritual purpose is for us to know how it feels and we will never ever do it to another. Just give without expecting something from someone and just let the universe return the love that we give… let us therefore stop seeking love for love is everywhere. Just a motto I want to add: Dance as if nobody’s watching. Sing as if no one is listening. And love as if you have never been hurt before…
