Last year, she moved back and into an apartment next to her Dad and Cyndi, her step mom. She is probably the only person who I can tell enormous secrets too. Well, Two people, Her, and Sarah. Those are the only two people that I trust not to reveal my secrets. She's cool,  I'll probably type more about than anything else because lately I've practically been living with her.     C.J moved out. I thought I wasn't going to miss him when he moved out because he was an ass monkey when he lived here, But I miss him. I miss the cool music of Alkaline Trio, and Coheed and Cambria blaring from her guitar and from his surround sound, and I miss the rude, but needed comments that he makes towards Megan. I went to the theater sunday with Sarah to see the Village and C.J gave me free popcorn and a free drink. Seeing as how he never has done that before, I was utterly shocked. Wednesday was his birthday and mom made him a Broccoli Casserole cake. It was good. Ha, He left it here, and I ate it...he was suppose to take it home.  Oh well. I would of gave him a large amount of money, say a fifty but mom gave me a twenty and told me to give it to him instead. For his graduation present, I gave him half of my savings. It took forever for me to save up. But, I made the big decision to give him one hundred dollars. Now, How I have it, I saved up two-hundred-thirty something.    I'm out like a lamp, Later Donkeys.
