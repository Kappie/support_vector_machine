Then after that, I'm gonna come home and probably go back to bed for a while, only to wake up and study some more, woohoo!!  LOL.  Speaking of studying, if anybody's taken physical science EOC and wants to give me some helpful hints in what to study, it would be GREATLY appreciated, lol.   Lyrics stuck in my head:  With a fresh sense of purpose and direction We cannot hide now from ourselves In disguises all our own Still we can't escape at all We run from things that can be seen... I won't run from this world Only our faces hide The quiet defeat inside Only our faces show Reflections of so much more  "Only Our Faces Hide" - Beloved   Later :)  >
