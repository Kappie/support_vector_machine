With this money, I intend on buying this awsome bed set from Ikea.  The bed set is blue, white, beige and red (It looks so good!).   My pretty pink room will be changed into a "more grown up" blue room.  Heh, I can't wait.  Jasmine  is going to buy me this "bambu" blind that goes up on the wall.  I am going to finally dispose of that old raggady cat poster and replace it with the bambu blind.   The frilly pink curtains are going to go down and will be replaced by dark blue curtains that will be about the same length as kevans (perhaps even longer?).  Last but not least, I am going to move my room around (hey, you guys can help if you want!).  One day, I hope to be able to paint my room to make it look nice.   *The title was not suppose to be gross.
