Happy happy happy! *DISCLAMER DON'T BLAME ME IF YOURS DOES TOO* Just kidding...hehe... Hmm the colour's mucked up, we can only get 16 bit not 32 bit which is a bummer! So at the moment every thing looke ladode. (La-do-d-e) Fun! Ehe. Oh my New Year was spent at home with my cats, depressing huh? Not really, I was running around screaming "Don't panic!" Because the sound of the fireworks seriously freaked the cats out. Hmm so of all the interesting junk mail I got none of it was interesting. Confused yet? I know I am! I got one about me becoming a baby sitter in America! Uhuh. Even though I'm what, 13? nearly 14 and live in England they still wanna get me to be one. Hmm...guess some one's gotta do it. But...maybe not me, today at least. Hmm oh and Izzy all that stuff I told you you're telling no one otherwise...otherwise...! I give Vincent your mobile phone number! HAH! Oh and by the way I don't want to be a American baby sitter so don't ask. Happy new year and hope you don't catch a bug! Oh, sorry, I was talking to your computer. (Not lost it aye?)
