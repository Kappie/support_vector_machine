All the fucking construction going on here at the apartment is driving me out of my mind. It's like living in a GD third-world country. I swear, it looks like a tornado hit and left debris lying all over the place. These construction guys don't pick up their shit. Case in point: I get home at 6:30 tonight. I pull up and notice that no one is parked in front of our building. I think, "Cool! I'll park up front." Then I realize- no, the dumbass construction workers, knowing that people come home between 5-7 every day, have their fucking shit lying EVERYWHERE and orange extension cords are lying around so you can't park without landing on one. So I call out to this guy working a sawhorse, "Can you move your cord so I can park?" because there is literally NOWHERE to park. And the guy- who is an older white gentleman, so he does not have the excuse of being a dumbass Mexican day laborer who lives in a three-bedroom apartment with 10 other families and does not speak a word of English- sorry, I had to get that out- looks at me like I'm speaking fucking Russian and just goes back to what he's doing. Ooookay. So I get pissed and I park right on top of his GD extension cord. Then he deigns to look at meand yell, "Do you mind not parking on that cord?" So I yell back, "Do YOU mind MOVING the cord so I can park my car here, IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE. I mean, I just LIVE here." And he very snottily moved the cord, and I very snottily tried to run over his fat foot. Oops. My bad. :)        They touch my car, they are fucking dead.        And when I get inside, I have another surprise. They had cut off the power today, AND they left a note saying that Alabama Power is going to cut it off b/t 9 and 3 tomorrow and their only sop to us RENT-PAYERS is "Oh, don't open your fridge." Yeah. I know some apartment bitches who are going to be replacing a lot of Atkins meat if they don't get their shit together.        And the noise, noise, noise, noise, noise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't handle all the noise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        I so seriously did not sign up for this shit. "Construction crackhouse" was NOT one of the community perks listed in the Apartment Guidebook.        And I'm not even going to discuss how I feel about work these days. I have enough on my plate dealing with asshole day laborers.        There needs to be an Unkymood for ENRAGED. She could have steam coming out of her ears and a look of pure, unadulterated rage on her face. That's what I'm seeing right now when I look in the mirror, anyway.        Happy place... gotta find my happy place...
