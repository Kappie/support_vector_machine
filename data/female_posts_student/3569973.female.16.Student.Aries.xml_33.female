Hmm...I'm pretty sure the last day that I wrote was tuesday and now...its....FRIDAY! Okay well wednesday I took my app. to Hallmark, got my pay check, and went to Jake's house to hear Brandon and him jam out on their guitars. lol. Then later I went over to Jessica's to get ready to go to the carnival. So then me, Jessica, Sarah, and Lauren went to the carnival and I rode all the rides...and also felt like I was gonna puke for the first time in well...for the first time. Well then we realized that we were hungry so we left and went to go get a tent from Jessicas sister. Then we went to Mcdonalds to eat. We ended up running into Steven and Chase where, Jessica and Lauren got Steven's car with some red window chalk. LOL...it was soo funny. Well then we drove around and Steven came over to help set up the tent. We ended up not going to sleep until like 1:30 in the morning. The next day was....thursday...oh gosh...oooook...i remember. I took Lauren home and headed home myself to clean the house for the week and to take a shower so that I could leave whenever Jake got there. Well nothing really exciting happened...just heard him play his guitar and then we left. Came home and ended up leaving like 4 times, for I'm guessing just no reason...lol...but I did. Then waited for Jake to get out of practice so that I could go to the carnival. I made Jake ride the Zipper and he got sick and brought me home...so we ended our little adventure earlier than expected. I came home got on here and went to sleep, because I was soo tired. I was suprised when I woke up at 8:30, ran...(which I couldn't believe) and now I gotta clean some more and stuff so that when Jake gets out of practice we could go swim or something before I gotta get ready to go out tonight with ALL OF MY FRIENDS. Which I haven't done all summer. Its gonna be great. I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. So well I guess thats all I have for now...I'm sure I'll write later tonight or sometime tomorrow. Till then, Later Days
