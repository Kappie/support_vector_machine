Those of you who have/had babies or babysit know what particular stench I speak of.  I thought it would be cute/fun (and other generic words) to get the Baby Powder scent in my car when I got it washed at the Boat Car Wash on Hamilton.  BIG MISTAKE.  Instead of a nice powdery, fluffy scent, it reeks of aged feces.  My weapon of choice: Febreeze.
