If you are really dumb, then you probably didn't notice that I have been pretty busy. I've been running around everywhere, doing things for everyone. Even the school secutary ( I probably didn't spell that right, but I have no time to spell check [have to eat dinner]) has me doing work for her. It really sucks, everyone and their whore is having me do stuff, not to mention that I have to get my program changed. Peace Out for now.
