So jump in the shower, call Cox and find out there is an outage and there is nothing to be done, pack, call Beth to make sure her modem is working... get her cell phone voice mail, leave message. Drive to Hallmark. Liz calls, can't find invitation and her cat has gotten out so she might be a little late. Beth calls, I can get online at her house! Go to starbucks. Meet nice lady and discuss the benefits of Soy Milk. Get in the car. Drive to Beths. FINALLY find directions and also get directions to hotel. Go to Liz's sister in law's and pick her up. All is good till we are well into Maryland and realize, no one has the invitation, no one knows what the church's name is and certainly no one knows their way around Wilmington. So call Toni and aparently now the Gods are smiling down on me because Toni finds the invitation and gives us all the info we need. We get to hotel and cannot check in so we walk around and find out that NOTHING is open on Saturdays and NO ONE lives in Wilmington on the weekends. Dead city. Would never recommend Wilmington, DE to anyone... Wilmington NC on the other hand is a whole different story. So FINALLY find a sub place and have the BEST subs but are full and then walk back to hotel. We check in. Order wine. Start drinking and getting ready. Go walk to wedding. Liz and I are both wearing shoes that hurt after about fifteen minutes, fortunately the church is only three blocks from hotel. Wedding is LONG and church is not airconditioned. Even though the weather is beautiful outside, inside it is hot AS HELL! Anyway, wedding is GORGEOUS! Marshall gives all three of us a big hug when we walk in. We are so excited for him! We go to our seats and run into same girl we ran into earlier in elevator after checking in and again in coming back down to lobby with her boyfriend. Paula and Kent. We sit through long ass boring (no offense) wedding and then go back to hotel. We drink more wine and kick up our feet. Then decide we should go to reception. Wait for hotel driver who takes us to beautiful manor style house for reception... OH TIME TO GO HOME... Will finish the story later.

All hotels are booked, took me all morning... I think nothing really happened this day... and Friday was pretty much the same. I hung out with Toni all night watching television and QAF. Did nothing spectacular. Had fun though.  [ Mon Sep 30, 04:29:50 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Wednesday   Well back to the week... So Wednesday rolls around and hello, boring as hell day... the slow turtle like time left at old job begins. DAMMIT! But whatever. So get through the day, nothing eventful happens. Finish up work, get ready for class. Go to class and Leigh calls me on the way, asking me when exactly I was going to tell him that we GOT PHISH TICKETS!!! AHHHHHHHH!!! WE GOT THEM!!! Aparently the time the server timed out it just didn't show me the screen but the SALE WENT THROUGH! We got Phish tickets! I was yelling into the phone I think. I was on a high. I called my dad and was all excited, that's when he told me he was just going to get them for me for Christmas anyway! So nice! But it's all good cause now he doesn't have to spend so much money! It takes everything to get through class and afterwards I go meet up with Leigh and Kelly. WE WILL GET KELLY A TICKET! SHE IS GOING WITH US! But LEIGH AND I HAVE TICKETS! So yay! Anyway, so I hang out for a while and then head home. Of course I walk in the door and find someone (who's name I will not mention) in a comprimising position on the couch with a guy... nothing X rated, not even R, maybe PG13... but always an annoying and awkward moment for me when this happens. So these two "people" are coming up with lame ass excuses as to why they are in this position and I, not really thinking say 'hey "guy" don't worry about it, this is nothing' or something along those lines. That's all I was gonna say but aparently "said girl" thought I was going to say more and SNAPPED at me. I laughed. So then I go into my room and change cause I am frickin tired! And I get ready for bed and the next thing I know "said girl" comes into my room asking for a cigarette. She's all hyperactive on speed (not REALLY!) just on a natural high and I am all tired! Too funny. [ Mon Sep 30, 04:15:43 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] So Saturday Night...  So Saturday night, after NOT getting Phish tickets... (this is still 9/21) I meet up with Eric around 10 PM at Borders and head out to Nation. Dressed in red (after all it was the Red Party). Since it's a gay club I highly expected to be around gay men all night, what I didn't expect was to be one of like 9 women. And it was fairly obvious by the way they were probably all straight girls there with their gay male friends, same situation I was in. We had the best time. Got drunk, danced, had a blast! What really shocked me were the straight guys who would come up and just totally invade your space. Oddly enough I didn't mind when the gay guys did it, maybe cause I wasn't threatened, but when the straight guys came up I almost felt annoyed! It was way funny! We had THE BEST TIME! But we didn't get out of there until around 3 am and by the time we got home it was LATE! So I crawl into bed and decide to NOT set the alarm because I know I'll be up by 1pm at the latest! WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! So the next day I roll over and decide I should probably get up because it is probably around 1 in the afternoon... UM NO! 5PM! What the hell! I jump out of bed, realized I wasted the ENTIRE day and freak out because now I have to try and go back to sleep in like six hours. NOT GONNA HAPPEN! So I watch Charmed since I am staying away from the Emmys. Not all that great, pretty bored, finally go to bed and CANNOT SLEEP! So I pull out QAF and start watching it and try very hard to sleep again. NOTHING! Needless to say the next day I was drinking caffeine all day! Which leads you right back to Monday.... [ Mon Sep 30, 04:05:45 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Back Track  I completely forgot about the weekend before (9/20,21,22)! So Friday rolls around and I am feeling really good and I go home and Toni is getting ready for her date. So I agree to watch the dog and hang out at home. I had a big night the next night and I wasn't too excited about the idea of going out two nights in a row. So I curl up on the couch with some DVDs, Panic Room, Kissing Jessica Stein, Death to Smoochie, etc. I am doing fine, loving spending the time alone... until a certain someone calls. I think all of you know who that FRICKIN certain someone is. So we talk for a while about virtually nothing and when we hang up I am all depressed over talking to him and so what do I do? Grab the Gin and pull out Bridget Jones. Everything seems to be getting better, I am drunk after 6 straight up shots of Gin and the movie is making me feel better about life... only I forgot one thing... at the end of the movie HER GUY MOVES BACK FOR HER! Whatever... needed more Gin. But eventually I went to bed because I needed it and because I had to get up early to get PHISH tickets! So... Saturday morning rolls around (Toni didn't come home so Erin got up early to walk the dog) and then stayed up to get the tickets. At 10 on the dot, I get up and start calling ticket master and getting on the website. Well I think I finally get through on the website and come to find out that the server timed out... no biggie, there are three shows and I still have plenty of time. WRONG! I finally get through on the phone and they have me on hold for 15 minutes before they tell me it's the wrong phone number and I need to call a completely DIFFERENT number. BASTARDS! So I get on and start calling them. Finally get through again online and come to find out that all tickets are sold out. I decide to continue trying on the phone because maybe there is a hope in hell that I can get them still. So after the "line is busy" line over and over agian I give up around 11:30 p.m. (1 hour and 30 min after I started). So I try Cheap Seats or Event USA or whatever it's called... tickets are starting at $600. So then I go on ebay... again, starting around $500-$600. So I give up. I'm not going to Phish. I am sad and since I have been put in charge I have let numerous people down.... [ Mon Sep 30, 12:23:50 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Tuesday 9/24/02  Tuesday, I wake up... get stuck in traffic... late to work... again... call JoAnn to let her know I am going to be late... we discuss how traffic sucks and that I am eternally late to that office even if I were to leave like four hours before I had to be at work SOMETHING would stop me from getting there on time! I happen to mention (as a side remark) that maybe I won't be working there much longer. I don't truly mean it because again I have put no stock in the fact that I might actually get a new job. She and I laugh. So then I get in... FINALLY!... and get an IM from Jess saying I've got the job! No interview, no resume, she is just hiring me! So right away I yell scream and dance with joy before handing in my official two weeks! YAY!!! So all of this goes down and then I head to the Cardiologist... And YAY! They fit me with a heart event monitor... for CHRIST'S SAKE! It has got to be THE most annoying thing I have ever had! So I wear it and whatever but I have to continue to wear it for the next 30 days! WHAT FRICKIN LUCK! [ Mon Sep 30, 12:18:18 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Monday 9/23/02  Monday I get a cryptic IM from Jess saying that I absolutely need to call her when I get home that night... well what is my first thought? Some major crisis going down. I am all panicky cause it's only around 2 in the PM and I am stuck waiting till 7 to make sure that she is okay. So I get home, call... no answer... more panicking.... then she IMs me to tell me to call her in 10 min. So I do. No crisis, but she may have a possible job for me... but I don;'t get my hopes up because I am never getting the hell out of CMG. Right? And besides things like this don't just fall into my lap.... [ Mon Sep 30, 09:12:06 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I had written out this long ass post about my (well now two weekends ago) weekend and I LOST IT ALL! I'll try again although details will be lost since an entirely new weekend has also come and gone.   Erin
