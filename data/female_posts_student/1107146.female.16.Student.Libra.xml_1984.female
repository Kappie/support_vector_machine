My brain might be just a  little  discolored, but that wasn't ever damaging. What's that? Brains don't change colors? Get out!!!   I'm not sure any hospital would take me...I do know a few good sanitariums, though! Altho I did like, bust all the tendons in my arms after that last one so, good call on the hospital, nonetheless!  Alright...let's do an experiment. Starting next Monday, on all BLogs, I'm going to type very very very terse responses. Let's see if I can do it. Mark those dayplanners, December the 8th.  Doublesigh.
