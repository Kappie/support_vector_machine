I've been overrun by my male cousins, and if they're not playing the PS downstairs, they're playing the computer. n_n;; I get cut off from using the internet. :P But I'm back! Back for now. :)    I took a quiz.        What Is Your X Japan Ballad?      *sigh* Love, it's so... thing! XP Ergh. Nevermind. n_n;
