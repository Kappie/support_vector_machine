But, it will pass soon.    I'm really excited about common ground tonight!  I get to use randys VIP tickets to go see Montgomery Gentry:)  Its gonna be fun.. im just starting to get into country but i have seen them on TV and heard some songs and they are pretty cool.  My friend Tania is going with me, and luckily i got a wheelchair too!  This is so great because now i dont have to worry about not being able to walk around or walking from the parking lot.  I'm just a little bummed though because i really was hoping that Andy was going to be able to go with me.  I know he likes country and i havent seen him in a long time, so i was really hoping he could go:(  I miss that guy.  I talked to him a couple times today though and we both agree that we need to get together soon.. so hopefully we actually will.  Unlike how me and Christy always say that and never actually do..lol.    I took a nap this afternoon and i was sleeping SO freaking hard!  It was unreal.. at one point my dream was so scary and real i tried to wake myself up but i couldnt!  This happens to me sometimes.. its really scary.  Then later the phone was ringing and i tried waking myself up again but i couldnt.. finally i did though and i felt exhausted like i had just did so much work..lol.  Weird shit man.  Well, guess im gonna get to bed here real soon.. im hoping i dont have a cracked out dream again cuz that is really scary sometimes.
