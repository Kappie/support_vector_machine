Dunno what happen to people whom I used to chat with. An e-mailed from somebody would really make my day. No e-mailed means no smile. Dont feel like bothering anyone. What ever comes comes. No bigges! Its hard and very tough to keep things inside and not letting anyone know exactly how I really feels. Its a good thing I got myself a journal :). Now I can really blast everything out.
