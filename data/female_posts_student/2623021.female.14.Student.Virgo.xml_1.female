My friend, the one with the hair, (Suzy) thinks that I am obsessed with ae... come to think of it, it's probably true too.  I could live off of ae stuff alone, and basically do... I have shoes, shirts, pants, a purse, a wallet, a necklace, perfume, and other random things from there. In LA at ae they have skateboards, and sandboards, and snowboards, that you can get painted and designed by people who work exclusively for american eagle. The ae nearest to me is around an hour and a half to two hours away. (depending on who drives) It serioudly is the best store, you should all go there! *Cheers*
