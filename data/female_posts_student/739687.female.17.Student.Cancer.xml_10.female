CrAzYLikeThat87: i'm supposed to be letting go! CrAzYLikeThat87: but here i am CrAzYLikeThat87: holding my emotions in the palm of my hand CrAzYLikeThat87: and i'm letting everything get to them CrAzYLikeThat87: why why why? CrAzYLikeThat87: nope...i'm not going to care... CrAzYLikeThat87: not...going to... CrAzYLikeThat87: i'm sitting here listening to dashboard sulking in self pity CrAzYLikeThat87: i'm pathetic  Yes, and there we have it. I need to go to Braum's. Ice cream always has a way of cheering me up. Especially Peanut Butter Hot Fudge Sundaes.
