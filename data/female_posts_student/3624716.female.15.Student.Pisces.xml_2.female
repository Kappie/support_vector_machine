(ha.) -but thats not the case either, the case is that you are stupid.- my cousin michelle, so true so true. haha. anyway, my friend tiffani, ya you, thinks that if i don't answer her when she calls the first time that she has to call 5 more times and leave 5 messages and they all say, are you mad at me? why aren't you answering me? i guess you're mad at me.. call me later or i'll call you. and then she does, at least 2 more times. ok, i may be exaggerating a little bit but seriously, come on! i was on the internet last night and i signed on and i was helping my dad get a light bulb and when i came back she/you imed me and when i did answer she said," hey, are you there? are you mad at me? well i guess you are. bye" i was like.... what?! but it's not just her, everyone is just stupid. people are fighting and they don't even know why. and i'm just easily annoyed lately. but mainly just by a few people. like you... ha. jk, well for some of you.... ;) well, yea.. that's it. (this is going to be something i'll do in all of my blogs)     *~*bellybutton*~* if you want to know i'll tell you the story later but you won't think it's that funny. :/ -doublepants-
