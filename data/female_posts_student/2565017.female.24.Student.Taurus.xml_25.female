Tomorrow I'm going to school to scan my very own "signature" and an ornamet that I drew...   I'm hoping to somehow turn them into proper images I can use on my website with this program (Macromedia Fireworks MX 2004). And I have no idea of how it works... oh shhhh.... it. Just realised that my thumb is covered in ink, lol! That's what you get from using a real ink calligraphy pen... But my ornament kicks ass :D It's worth the thumb.  Remember  NOT  to copy it :P Just reminding you in time...  I didn't remember how much time writing code can take! And it's a very simple code for that matter! But it's fun.... nice figuring out what's not working there and how to fix it...how to do things creatively, so that everything looks just right... This is the type of brain activity I like.... *sigh* maybe I should have become a programmer instead... lol. Nah, I like this as a hobby, that's all :)
