His legs twitching Back and forth Is he running free? In a field of dreams? Soon he calms The only movement is his soft chest Moving up and down As he heaves in and out I could go to sleep But I like watching him So peacful, so cute I choose to sit here, in bed Watching him sleep Watching him dream   I miss him I miss watching him sleep And I miss the way his small legs Would twitch back and forth When he slept, running in his dreams I miss the smell of him The look in his eyes I miss watching his chest Move up and down As he breathed in and out I miss his nose And his ears I miss Tobi
