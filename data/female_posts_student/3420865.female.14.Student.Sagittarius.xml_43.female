(and the kid spilled it everywhere when he was pouring it...poor guy.) then we went to my house, and i showed her around. it took so long, cuz she had to absorb everything in each room before she could move on...aha it was funny. then i made spaghetti...just for the fun of it.aha.then we hung out in my crib yo, and i showed her pictures of me when i was little (and fat). then, for the first time in my life, we went on my roof. (cuz no one was home...i'm not allowed to go on my roof, but whateva.) then we went back inside, cuz it was hot/sofija thought my dad was going to come home and hate her for being on the roof.   anywho. then we went on the ledge above the hall (which is hard to get on/high/scary, for those of you who haven't seen it) and just sat there and talked...then my brother came home, and told us to get down. so then we just hung out in my room and stuff...then we sat on the stairs for like an hour, talking and stuff. then my dad came home, and my mum's friends made pizzas...so we ate them, obviously. then my mum came home from work at like 8, and drove sofija home.   then i went on msn for like half an hour, played the sims, and talked with my parents and their friends and stuff...then i went to bed at like 10...cuz i was tired.   so yes. it was a sweet day.   *awkward silence between my brother, sofija and i.*  "...so...whaddup."-me  "ahaha you're so mean."-sofija  "..."-me  "oh you said whaddup. i thought you said shut up."-sofija   *after my necklace fell off...*  "ahahahahahahahaha!"-sofija. laughs for like 10 minutes.  "..."-me  "ahahaha oh man. that was the best part of my life."-sofija   "i'm going to go get some spaghetti. and put it all over your ledge, and call it art."-sofija      "will your dad hate me if i go on the roof?"-sofija   *ten minutes later.*   "will your dad hate me if i go on the ledge?"-sofija   *continues like this for like the whole time she's at my house.      "hey kate. how you smellin'? i am oficially [scratches out oficially, writes cool] the awesomest person ever parceque i'm the first person to write here. THAT'S RIGHT! [heart] sofija."-something sofija wrote on my wall...it's so cool.      anywho. that's all, folks.      2 days! aaah i can't believe i leave on monday...wow. this weekend=packing for kate. i'll miss blogging...and of course, my friends. and my dad and brother. but anywho.      herei am watching clouds from your bedroom window,   as weâ€™re laying here.      kayte.
