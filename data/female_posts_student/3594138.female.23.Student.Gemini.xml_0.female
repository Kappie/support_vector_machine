I like their clothes because they fit really well, and the material is really good. The lady at the cash register tried to get me to open a Banana Republic credit card, and I was really tempted to get one. She could see me wavering. But no, I had to be strong. I have too many credit cards and not enough money, hehe.  Maybe we'll go back to the outlets tomorrow! ooooooooooh.
