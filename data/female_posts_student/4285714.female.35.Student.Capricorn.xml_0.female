Let's just say.........if he's cheating,  he really sucks at covering his tracks and he should be a pro at that after his former marriage. C came in from work today.....did you  hear  what I said? He came  in  after work today and emptied his pants pockets on the bathroom counter and there sits a piece of paper with "her" full name, address AND home telephone # on it? All I can say to that is hmmm.....! So for right this moment I am going to push that thought (cheating) to the side and when we are on  a first name basis again I will tell him of my suspicions. It's kinda hard to talk to him when  we aren't talking ...lol.  It really BITES big time that everything I see reminds me of or makes me think about sex! Maybe my hormones are a little TOO good considering the state of  my relationship at the moment. ( now is when I need to go hunting for some of those little smiley faces you can use in your blog).  So I'm at the courthouse today dropping off some paperwork that I pulled out of my ass by the way. Like  I know  how to write a response to a civil summons without a lwayer....RIGHT!! But that's what I did AND I turned it in. Nope, no DUI or manslaughter charges.... just a hearing with the ex about child support issues. anway...back on track..................  There's a girl there, couldn't be more than 15-16, she's with her MOM and she's wearing a lowrise pair of jeans with a thong that goes halfway up her back, if THAT doesn't SCREAM "see my thong" I don't know what does. What the hell is up with kids these days and whats up with wanting everyone to see their underwear?? We ALL have them and most of us don't want to see yours. I'd kill my daughters for dressing like that and the bad part is this is juvenile court and it looks as though she's getting ready to go stand in front of the judge. What the hell is MOM thinking??? Geez loueeze!  So anyway.....a good day for the most part. My papers are filed, my husband is actually   in  the house and he even went to the store AND before he left he asked if I needed anything. Progress. Progress.  So tomorrows a new day......I have tons of stuff to get done AND...get this!! My income tax return came in today so now I can pay for those classes without the guilt of using his credit card to do it and I can even buy the books.  A few comments on the comments.............. Have I already said that I appreciate the input? :o)  Geez, it sounds really bad when you say "I shouldn't kid about a divorce". I really wasn't kidding about it, if things didn't look up in our relationship I  was going to pay a visit to my lawyer. Just mentioning that the thought had crossed my mind was taken as a threat by C, and a threat he felt he needed to act on. I think maybe I DID mean it as a threat and jsut didn't realize what his reaction to that would be. Bad me. I totally see where you are coming from in what you say (man it's GREAT!!! to get a man's persective on this crap). I know I said I was bluffing about the divorce...and I was! (and I realize now from what you are saying that it was a bad idea) my intentions though were to toss the idea around with him and see what his reaction would be to it. Guess I know now.  I made a few calls today about a part-time job., but first things first (I've been putting this off way too long now) I've got to get enrolled in classes so I can give them my school schedule to work around. I'll let y'all know what comes of that.  Chatted long enough for one sitting as usual, I think I may need to hide part of my posts so they don't take up so much room. Looking forward to any and all comments.   Check ya later....Dawn
