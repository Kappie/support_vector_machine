So I just left and cried to Kyle and Amanda!  I'm sick of Mark!  Everyone likes him better, except for Ashleigh and Amanda because they assured me that they don't!  It made me feel a little bit better, but how about everyone else?  There is Frank, Lani, Karina, Lori, Ryan O'Connell, Sean, Kyle, Kyle, Rachel, Shandi ... the list goes on forever!  What is so likeable about him?  I don't understand!   ... So you must be wondering what sparked this ridiculous fight, go ahead, ask!  Me taking my AFI CD back from Mark because I got mad that he took it without asking me!  Then he accused me of stealing his shit all the time!  So I asked him what I took, and he called me a name and I left!  Ahh, I don't like him at all!  There is a deffinate chance that I won't see or talk to Alex this weekend, which is sad!  Because Rachel is going to be with Brittany all weekend!  Well, what does that have to do with you seeing Alex?!  The only time I see him is when I'm at her house!  And it's not like I call him or anything, so there isn't a way for me to make plans with him!  Ahh, so call him!!  But I can't because I get nervous because there are always those awkward silences and Ahhh, I hate them so much!   After school today, actually after 3rd block I went home with Karina and we hung out in my room for a long time!  I finished my CapriSun purse and it made me really happy because I've been wanting one for so long!  Yay!  Then we went to Karina's house and she tried to hem my dress, but it didn't work becuase the fabric is weird!  So I had to come home and hand sew it!  It was a pain in the ass! On my way home I practically got attacked by 2 dogs, it was scary because I don't like animals at all!  But then the owner came and saved me!   Oh, my dad was about to drive my car over to the place to get it fixed today and it wouldn't start!  Dammit, I'm so sick of my piece of shit car!  It makes me miserbale and it only leads to problems!  I need a new car!  Ahh, and he tried to blame it not starting on me!  He told me that I should have tried to start it every couple days to make sure it was still working!  How the hell was I supposed to know to do that unless he told me?
