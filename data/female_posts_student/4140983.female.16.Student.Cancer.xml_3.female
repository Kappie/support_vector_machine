I packed for the mission trip, I have NO IDEA what to bring, so I brought everything. I'm not Miss Most Prepared 2002-2003 for nothing. I did ALL my laundry. That's something that's been plaguing me all summer. Because I only wash what I need, I ALWAYS had clothes that need to be washed.  My pole is like my penis. I mean, if I had one. I'm insecure without it. I compare poles with the other girls to see who's is best weighted and nicest. We're happy because we're one of two schools with six-foot poles. I like it because it makes me part of a group. Yeah. I play with a six-foot phallus. This Intelligent Thought of the Day has been brought to you by the Jasmine is a Perv Foundation.  In other news, Lauren linked both my website and my blog in her blog. Ha, it's cool because I don't know any of her friends, so I don't have a problem with them caring about my life. Ha, Lauren's the only person I've told about my blog anyway.  My mom's home, and here I was all afraid I'd be late for practice!
