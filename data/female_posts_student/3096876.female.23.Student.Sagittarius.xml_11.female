I thank my Catholic high school edumacation for jading me so fiercely as to be absolutely repulsed any time I see any hooray-god bullshite.  There's obviously no point in rambling like this, but it's my right to do so, just like all darn theists.    Here's something though: so many are talking about Jesus and quoting this or that part of the Bible, and yackity yack. Who's been doing any real self-motivated learning in religious studies?  Especially  comparative  religious studies.  Kamenetz wrote a great book, should be on everybody's list:   urlLink The Jew in the Lotus.   The point is not Judaism vs Buddhism, rather a look at pluralism (sans the cultural relativism.)  What's important here is not about how we are different, but about how we are the same in our differences.  It's not about a nihilistic absolute truth, but the plurality of truth s .  When a delegation of Jewish representatives went to see the Dalai Lama, they thought they could go there to teach 'em a thing or two.  What they found when they got there is that they had a lot of learning to do themselves.  We are the same in our humanity, in our suffering, in our ability to be compassionate, in our need to receive compassion from others.  No need to quote that stuff, it's all pretty basic.  It seems that religious holidays bring out the zealot in us all.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all about having a paid day off, (read the previous blog, I spent it drinking and fornicating.)  But it's when people maintain their fundamentalist, literalist leanings that I get a little antsy.  What university taught me, other than how to be a snob, was that there are simply too many people on this planet, heck, there are too many people on a square block in the Dot, to ever stake a claim as if it were infallible.  Pointing to this paragraph or that chapter, or this line or that reference is meaningless.  I'd sooner site truth out of a cookbook.  What the world, and especially Easter weekend, seems to be lacking is honest insight. Too many cling blindly, and falter,while others (like myself) choose not to believe, to withhold that commitment, until something really genuinely inspired comes along.  The Passion is just a movie, the Bible is just a book.  Stories, all fake.  What's real is what we believe, because it guides what we do.  Look not to others for guidance and instruction, but deep within yourself...if you're looking for the truth.  And if all you're looking for is someone to negate your guilt, to reassure you that you're good and loved, and to give your money to...then I guess organized religion is right up your alley.
