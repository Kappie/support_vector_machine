They like speeches and demos because they are told what to think. And they are with a lot of other people the same as themselves, which makes them think they're thinking for themselves and doing something about what they think. But they aren't. It's all a trick, a con. What they're really doing is giving themselves up to somebody else who is just using them.  喔, 差點忘了, 今天是林惟萱的生日. Happy Birthday!
