It hurts not being able to do anything to make the pain go. I miss her so much. i'm wretched with guilty conscience because i never really treated her that well. I'm sorry .. i was too stressed out i didn't mean to lash out you.Forgive me. I won't ever take my loved ones for granted anymore.  Woke up 2dae..did all the housework.. sweeping..washing clothes and etc. Damn tired. Yuzry called..chat for a while. As usual both of us talk crap. he kept giving me compliments..gosh i'm lyke blushing all the way. Thanks ya. It was my ex zai burfdae today. He's 17 this yr. He was shocked i still remembered his burdae. Of course i do, i never forgt my frends burdae. May all ur wishes and dreams come true.   Someone actually a guy frend said why i never really try to dress up or look pretty in school. I replied politely saying unlike some drama queens who wear short skirts,use make up,fanciful earrings/earstud,showing off their branded bags..hahaha eh to all those who ''terasa'' too bad uh.. my purpose of going to school is to get a good education. u dun have to show tht u are pretty. I suceed actually. I look diffrent when i'm in school and when i'm outside. Yes,people claimed i don't know how to dress up, wear make up and stuff. hey they had their last laughs when they saw me last sun at esplanade. Suprised eh? I saw u all looking at me and for the fact that ur frend actually asked for my number,serves u right gerl. I'm not that thick skin. Words can't and will never bring me down. Get that in your head.
