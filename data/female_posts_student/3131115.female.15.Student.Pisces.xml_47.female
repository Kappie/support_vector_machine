These are the times when i wish I had a nice razor blade in my hand..cutting my flesh..but that's all over. No more of that.   I babysat Korah today. It was fun, but she wouldn't sleep. I finally got her to sleep after a long time, but then she only slept for an hour instead of two. Oh well, I had fun with her anyway. I think I might be getting paid, I dont really care about it..but it would be nice so that I can pay for the paint for my room.   My dad wont let me paint it the colors that I want...but, maybe I can work something out with him. I wanted to color my walls black, but I think that I'm going to end up with red or something. My dad said that he'd look up a guitar for me on the computer which is cool. Bill is getting his drum set in a couple of days, so Im going to get a guitar..and then bill and I are going to be in a mini band and I'm going to end up playing drums and him guitar and singing probably. Okay, we'll never end up doing it..but oh well. Bill said that he'd never be in a band with me..but I think it'd be cool.   Anyhow, I'm going to go make a movie. I'll write more later maybe.
