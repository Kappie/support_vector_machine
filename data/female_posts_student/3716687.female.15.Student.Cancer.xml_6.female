Tomorrow I'm cleaning all day until about 2:30, then I'm meeting up with Michael and his mom at starbucks so we can catch up, I mean it's been 2 weeks or so now since I've seen him.      Then I'm off to my lesson, and back home to pack.      Tuesday I'm going to warped tour all day long. Then waking up  early  wednesday morning to go back to Nags Head with Nicole (what a mess that was to work out between our parents).      I come back from that on saturday or so, and sunday is church.      I'm home until next friday, and then I leave again for another 10 days to look after my grandmother again.       So....guys, I'm not really gonna be able to hang out with anyone for the rest of the summer. I'm really sorry, and I hate not being able to do anything with anyone, but I guess that's just the way that life goes.      Well, I need to get some sleep, it's been a long week, and I don't wanna look like a zombie when I see Mike tomorrow :)      Love you all,      Allison
