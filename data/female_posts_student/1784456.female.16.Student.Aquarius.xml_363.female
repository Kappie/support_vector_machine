I just think cannabis should be legalised. I actually think that smoking should be banned instead of cannabis! What's wrong with that opinion? Ok so I'm stuck in moral rambling mode... I'll type a bit about fox hunting after this! (Oh whoopie I hear you scream in horror) Yeah, I'm mad. Must be Quasar effecting me!
