His wife will welcome the company.  urlLink  Gawain  : I see. And where will I be?  urlLink  Lancelot  : Wondering as is your good fortune why all your children look like me.  urlLink  Gawain  : Is this before or after I hit you with my axe?   [hello children! i am in love. i joke you not. yes, i will someday be bed buddies with all the knights of the round table... arthur included. eee err eee err goes my rocking bed.   [yesterday was most definatly a hoot. me and amanda walked to tillicum (bilsters and all) to see king arthur. it was so good. so good that i saw it twice. i went at 1 with amanda and then later with my parents at 7:10. haha you know it 's a good movie when i go twice in less than 12 HOURS! hahaha good times. i laughed my ass off, i cryed my mascara off. all in all i had a good time. after me and amanda went, we headed over to tillicum heckled val at work. "Hi, can i get 87 cheese burgers... without the cheese." and we walked around, tried out mens calogne at london drugs, oggled the creatures at petcetera and stalked a guy to winners (it's a long story...), oh and we stared at this guy at the watch stand when we were on the escalater. he had the prettiest eyes! omg, you could see them a mile away. seriously fun day. then i went home, demanded that my parents go and see it, they brought me with them, and then i missed canadian idol. so i all was fab except that i have no idea who was voted off.  (leave me a comment if y'all know what happened last night on canadian idol! thanks)  i honestly had like 4 litres of coke and/or pepsi last night. i feel ill. felt ill. now i'm all hopped up on porridge. mmmmm brown sugar.   [so today.... i decided that i wanted to get some books, so i went to the public library and learned about all the new features. oooh, it's almost all internet accesable! fancy! i can do everything but actually get the book, all from the comfort of my own home! yea dude. oh, so i get myself a new card and all that, and then i went on my book hunt, and came out alive with into thin air, finnie walsh and king arthur and his knights. (I.T.A. and Finnie are for my parents, seeing as i've read both in school.) i'm so obsessed with king arthur now. my learn more about my boys, tristan, boys, dag, gawain and galahad. lancealot and arthur are a little overrated, but that's okay, they're still super duper! and now i'm eating porridge and getting ready for the lake. should be a grand time getting up there, seeing as it's 32* now. gah, so warm. what is it a low of, like 21 or something... i think that's what it was yesterday. gawd. anyway, i should skadattle and help my mum pack up the truck. tootles.... oh, and carlos, you're a wank. you couldn't even call to say you wouldn't make it? wtf mate. you have my number, use it! gawd, stand me and amanda up much.
