I can't tell you who everyone else is, but I can tell you that I am in my tenth day of not smoking! Isn't it great! I am so charged every day with joy, love and withdrawal symptoms that I am very capable of shoving my trackball up your ass.  Hey, can I cuss here? Sure I can. Nice to meet you all, oh fellow doomed net dwellers.
