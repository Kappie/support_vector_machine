I have three reasons why: 1:Our comp broke down for a while. 2: I was tired and busy 3: Nobody has ever seen this sad excuse of a blog, but me, so I figured: "What the heck is the point -__-;"  Anyway; I was struggling to find a good FFX-2 walkthrough with ZERO success. I found one good spoiler-free walkie, but it didnt work...it was broken -_-; *psssht*  And I want to find some good FFX page too X) With lotsa fun pictures *nyuuum*   I shall go seek those out. *dashes away dramatically* Sha!
