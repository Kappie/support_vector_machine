I was like, wow, the gpas drop fast.  anyway.  she said, "sunshine, you're famous!  my mom's friend's knows all about you and your grades."  and lisa, who came up to work with us cuz she didn't have a book, either, said, "Yeah!  my friend's mom knows about you, too..."  and I was like, "whoa.  fuh ree key."  ya.  other than that, french was totally boring.  as usual.  except for erica [from algebra] and catie kuisis.  they're so funny.  I actually talk to them in french.  it's kinda strange.  today in orchestra, they did auditions.  but I didn't know that they were today [b day does them before a day?  unfair!] so I didn't practice the music AT ALL before today.  so I was like craaaaaaaaaap.  so I hurried up and practiced and practiced.  and I actually got it down!  but then the conductor from PWHS came to talk to mrs booth, so that took up like 45 minutes, and we spent 20 minutes getting ready, and then some other junk happened, so only 2 or 3 violinists auditioned today.  -whew!-  then the stupid lab prac... don't even want to think about it.  then I got home, and chuan started telling me about his nefarious plans.  he is going to bribe kailing with BLUE RASPBERRY JOLLY RANCHERS.   BLUE RASPBERRY.   man.  that is just... beyond evil.  but maybe I will have a coupe and... interfere with his operation!  puahahaha.  hopefully, he has not talked to jack about it.  that would just be beyond embarrassing.  then my mom came home and we went to hobby lobby and got some art paper.  then we went to walmart so I could get some canvas... and then I got a book!  and I also got lots and lots of yarn.  yay.  so... yay!  I still have my commapps references to do.  so, ta ta, my bonny lasses.  =)  kailing - your ramblings... you ramble about everything.  hahaha.  but I was referring to your rambles about jack and chuan.  the whole "bugger off, you prats" kinda thing.  but not in those words.  and now you're gonna bother me about exactly what it was you were saying about them that would qualify as "rambling".  man.  meng - EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE??  that's HOOOORRIBLE!  but if it makes you feel better, I'm going through hormonal imbalances right now.  most because of chuan.  grr.  wait.  not ta ta yet.  yesterday, jack came over to work on flower project.  we were walking along outside looking for maybe replacement flowers, and he went into this huge ant killing spree.  he went and dug into the ant hills... like, there's a hill.  above ground.  like this: /\  and then, he took the huge shovel and went dig!  dig!  dig! [all the while cursing them for always biting him], and when he was done, it looked like this: \/.  he did that to three ant hills.  and then he got tired.  haha.  and he thought yesterday was HOT.  man.  he has not lived through a texas summer.  I will be in china laughing at him this summer.  so then we came back home and we pressed flowers.  then my parents decided to come talk to jack.  man.  if I were jack, I'd be scared to death of my parents.  they're freaking psychotic.  so jack is pressing flowers... he sees a box of tictacs.  wintergreen, in case you were wondering.  so he goes and eats like... the whole box.   lots of wintergreen working there.  and my dad's outside barbequeing stuff.  and so he comes in, cuts off a bit of steak, and sticks it on a fork.  he tries to feed me with the fork by sticking it in front of my mouth.  I say no.  dad looks crestfallen!  jack is innocently [ha!] pressing flowers.  theeeen, dad sees jack!  dad has epiphany.  "jack, want to try some steak?!"  jack, "no... not really, thanks."  goes back to pressing flowers.  dad goes and jabs steak in front of jack's face.  jack looks up, startled.  I shrug at him.  he looks like o__o, but of course he is smiling.  so kinda like... 8)?  not quite,  anyway.  he's like, "uhh..."  my dad senses jack weakening... he moves onto final attack!  "come on, jack!  don't hurt my feelings by not eating it, like sunshine."  jack gives up.  [poor jack.]  he opens his mouth and my dad stick the fork in his mouth.  I look on.  it is quite interesting when your dad is spoon [fork] feeding your biology partner.  dad looks on.  jack chews, but still smiling.  dad says, "do you like it, jack?"  jack mumbles, "mmhmm!"  dad goes away, satisfied.  ["see, yang, jack says it's good!"]  jack waits until my dad is outside before saying, "it tastes interesting with a tictac in your mouth."  I almost die laughing.  then my brother came down to watch us, and we confused him with strange kant philosophy.  poor stephen.  he got so confused... he couldn't win!  then we started talking about dimensions.  first is a line.  second is square.  third is cube.  fourth is time/space.  fifth, according to a wrinkle in time, is a tesseract.  sixth, jack and I made up, is pocahontas.  [because, you see, pocahontas was an indian.. and she had to go to england.. which means she was in two different places.. so in the sixth dimension, you can be in two places at once!] seventh is sun.  [haha.  sunshine and jack sun, get it?  hahaha.] [so in seventh, time is basically folded.  you exist with every form of yourself throughout time simultaneously.]  there was some serious psychological thinking going on in there.  =)  and then we waited for the flowers to get pressed.  so of course, we went and played super smash brothers melee!  and at first, it was only my brother and jack playing the computers, but then they got me to play with them, too.  I TOTALLY SCHOOLED THEM WITH KIRBY.  ha!  it was puh-ritty awesome!  hehehehehe.  and then we were like, maybe we should go check on the flowers.  so we did.  then we played more ssbm.  I schooled them some more.  puahahaha.  and they said I sucked at video games.  then it was eight and jack was like holy crap!  and he called his dad and he came to pick jack up and then everyone went home and we were all happy peachy.  for the first half of the afternoon, though, I was thinking "die, jack, die."  hahaha.  hormonal imbalances, indeed.  then today in art, I realized that I was sooo behind... I mean, I was supposed to be done with newspapering and manilla papering my armature by last tueday, and today I was still finishing up newspapering and just began on manilla paper!  I was supposed to begin painting today!!  but the good thing is, lots of other ppl are behind, too.  and our halfway is due next class!  I'll probably just be lazy and watercolor.  cuz that's fastest.  lol.  I'm so lazy.  SO!  wow.  this is a super long entry.  so you better have some nice, insightful comments for me.  >=O  haha, just kidding.  now, I'm off to go read some books!  and do the rest of my commapps hw... man.  toodles, bonny lasses!
