But she's still a big ol' hoochy mama.  I know, I know, it's not nice to judge, so I'm not, just casually observing.  I think she needs help... maybe a sesh or two with Dr. Phil?  Better yet, she should read some SARK.  She's like Liz, but 40 years ahead of schedule!     While I'm being horrid, can I ask why Friendster is so painfully slow, even on a cable connection?  Ah well, at least it's free,  I do love the whole concept.  If you know me  you're not on it, feel free to email me  demand to be put on.  It's TEE-riffic.  As it turns out, I don't actually have that many friends, but once you get 2 or 3 degrees away from me, you can meet some wonderful people, all over this land!   And what is the DEAL with only PC-ers being able to upload photos to this blog site??  If I can figure out a way 'round that, I'd love to spiff things up around here a bit.  In the meantime, you can pull up my pic in another window  position it alongside this one for that lovely effect of me blabbing straight at you.  Isn't that better?
