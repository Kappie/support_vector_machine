Well, I was bored out of my mind a few minutes ago so I turned on my Avril Lavinge CD and went to "(So Much For)My Happy Ending." I dunno why, I just clicked a track, and it was that one. And I started writing. And I got this. Tell me what you think or if you want me to post more. Thanks!   You Never Knew Me   You never knew me, Bits and pieces were just scattered on the ground, Picked 'em up and put them together. Wasn't too difficult, It was just fill in the blanks. You never saw through the lies, Always believed the fake smiles. Never knew what was hidden beneath, Almost caught me once. But you thought you knew me, So you believed me after I put up a fight. If you knew me, you should have known. I've been in love with him from the start... It wasn't your fault, I loved you too. But the love I had for him just came first, Because he was everything I ever wanted...
