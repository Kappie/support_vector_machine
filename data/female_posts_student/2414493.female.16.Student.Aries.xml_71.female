I have a piano master class Thursday that I'd better prepare for: it's the Ravel and hence the possibility for crazy mixed up notes, tangled fingers, etc. And it's Nancy Bricard. Sigh. I hope practice for the rest of the week won't mimic what happened this afternoon: after a shower, I decided I was tired. And slept until the piano lesson, no time to warm up. Sleep is good. Even when your hair is wet and you know you have to wake up in half an hour.  That was deep.  But I'm better now, albeit tired. Tutoring lasted longer than I expected, and I think both teacher and student were tired by session's end. Yawn.  And sometimes you just start talking to people and everything they say is a rebuff despite your crystal clear good intentions. It just has to keep you on your toes, I suppose. And some people are just positively down, and I have no way to help it. Some people are way too happy for their own good and you just can't match their bubbliness. Some people will use you and they will only demand.  I have yet to meet a pensive type like me who rarely talks. That's a good thing, though...it means that I'll have some sort of conversation wherever I go, and as the quiet one I can regulate it. It's just a matter of keeping up, of changing pace, of dealing.  Sadly, I think I need to start assigning numbers to every person I overanalyze so I can just keep track and remind myself how crazy this all is. It's all mental, though, which is what kills me: there will be nothing palpable I can stare at and investigate. Even that is scary. Even worse is that now I toss around something that doesn't even exist, and I make a game out of it.  So now I really wonder what I do in my free time. Either I spend it on the computer making worthless conversation that probably fuels my wild imagination, or I fall asleep. Or I do homework, or eat...speaking of which, I should start watching what I'm eating. And then there's that perennial if: IF I COULD DRIVE/had a car, I'd pop in the Postal Service and...go to Barnes and Noble. Yes, that's a safe choice.  And Mom starts doubting my college abilities. Maybe I thought I was too invincible in the past, but she's starting to get on my case again about APs and that 6-year med program at USC and blah blah blah. The only gem from that conversation: I love the Cheungs. I'd pay good money to have a family like that.  Sometimes I think I'm missing so many things.  Listen to the Postal Service.
