BTW Abby, do I need to send in the Cooking Contest thing, or will you?  If I do, then I need the brownie recipe you made up.  Also, did we decide to do it in the desserts category?  I think we did, but just making sure.  Oh, and what's Travis's e-mail.  Something like iamfrag or something like that.  As for Travis and Gaddis, well...duh. Also, they kind of rhyme.
