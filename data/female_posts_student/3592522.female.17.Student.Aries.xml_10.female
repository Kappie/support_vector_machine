Everything around me is part of him  Every song played, joke told, places I go  Can be traced back to when we were one  My heart sings tears of pain only for him.   My soul is crying out in sorrow  Like a lone wolf howling in the wind  I want nothing more than to feel his touch  And a simple goodbye, to be released.   I am jealous of the love everyone shares  Feeling cheated, Why am I left out?  His emotionless "love" has cut me  So deep that even my shadow bleeds.
