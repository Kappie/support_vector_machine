I went over to a family friends house, hes basically family to my dad, and i was gonna get him to tune my guitar because ive tried numerous times and im about to freakin smash it!! lol anyways, we go over there and he starts tryin to tune and yeah..he looked like he knew what he was doing. so anyways, after that he starts playing a song on it and his (im gonna be poliet) "brain damaged" 13-year old granddaughter comes up and pulls at one of the strings...the thinnest string....and it snaps. ugh i wanted to SCREAM OMG WHAT THE HELL ARE U DOIN LET HER MESS WITH OTHER PEOPLES STUFF, I KNOW SHE DOESNT UNDERSTAND BUT HEY!! THATS MY GUITAR STRING SHE JUST FUCKIN BROKE! i finally get the damn thing in tune..and then i cant play it. SO..Charlie (the family friend) says to me "well usually when u get a new guitar the strings arent that great, they give you the cheapest strings so they break easily. you need to really go down to the guitar place and have them put some medium strings on there and re-tune it and pick ya up a book about guitars." he didnt even tell his granddaughter "no" or "dont touch, its not urs" hell, sometimes i wish i was retarded and could run around breaking things too. okay..so maybe i dont mean that, because trust me, i feel for her and i understand myself that she doesnt understand. it just takes a few minutes to get over the intial anger. WELL...my dad figured charlie knew what he was talking about and we deiced to get better strings put on the guitar. cuz after all, charlie knows everything about guitars. We go to the guitar store and tell the guy a string broke and the story about how we're lookin for better strings because we were told mine werent basically worth shit. (i'll use my terms) and the "expert guitar" dude looks at it and says "well, these are actually expensive strings and they dont get much better than this" wow..my cheap ass strings that arent worth shit turned out to be good strings charlie. We paid a whole $5 to get one string replaced. Then i asked him to make sure it was in tune. Was it? dammit no. it was tuned too high and "that makes the strings pop" UGH dammit charlie!!!! lol While i was in there i got this book and cd he recmmended and he offered lessons and all and i told him i was from outta town. he asked me if i went to UNC..wow that made me feel good. everyone has always thought i was at least 2 years younger than i really am. pisses me off..but here he was askin me about college. haha i was wearing a unc colored shirt..so maybe that was it. I did tell him that i want to go there one of these days. I decided to pick up a guitar strap while i was in there also. I could either get one that tied onto the guitar or get a lil screw thing to hold the one i already have. Same price. I decided to just buy one that ties on to the neck. I could get a solid color..so i got blue. I wanted pink..but u know, they didnt have it of course. and i can always upgrade lol There was a hot dude about my age workin in there tuning electric guitars. I was like..dude..whoa ur hot..i didnt say that of course, but i sure thought it. I didnt realize he was sittin there and i walked over to look at this awesome pink electric guitar and i said.."hey dad! theres a hot pink one kinda like this online but it has glitter!!" haha the guy looked up at me and im like..i bet i just sounded soo stupid. HEY MAN I WANT A HOT PINK AND GLITTER GUITAR!! hahahaha omg..i need to stop sayin stupid shit.   Then we went to O'Charley's for lunch. i got a salad and these 2 hot college dudes from down the road at MTSU (near the house). One had blonde wavy hair just like a hot surfer dude would have. He was very nice to the waitress i noticed. She was young, but not attractive in my opinion. You could tell she thought they were hot! haha just seein her face. I was surprised he said "please" and "thank you" and called her "ma'am" even when ordering his cold beer. lol   I went to see the movie The Terminal. I love Tom Hanks! but that has to be the worest movie hes ever been in. 3 outta 5 stars. I give it 3 beacuse i felt bad for his character and i liked how he made friends and how much they supported him in the airport. There were a couple of laughs, 2 really hard laughs, no tears, and a handful of smiles. The ending sucked ass. lol   Did you know that Napoleon gave his wife a gold necklace with a locket on it and inside he had "destiny" written in it. That's the only quote that stayed in my head from that movie.
