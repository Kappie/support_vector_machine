Today a nurse in the unit called me that and she said that she didn’t know my name but because I was always smiling that should be my name.  I think for my optimistic outlook in life I have always been called strange names bubbly one, are you high on something, and now sunshine.  The third one is the charm.  I supposed is good to wake up in a good mood most days but it really sucks when you are having a bad day, everybody knows and then I get all the questions, what is wrong with you?  How come you are soo sad (even when I am just too tired to smile, people assume I am just upset).  But sunshine, that is winner.  However I did feel high today.  I was trying to secure my bike rack to bike today and the bolts were covered with silicon, so being the smart person that I used to be prior to the following incident, I decided to burn the plastic off the bolts,  I placed the bolts on the stove and proceeded to put the temp at the highest setting possible.  The bolts now secure my bike beautifully but I am afraid the plastic smell has ruined my lungs, who would have though burnt plastic smelled so bad? Silicon can’t really be all that bad for you, some women use it for the breasts, other for their lips, I just happen to take a skin deep approach to beauty and place it in my lungs.  I bought the bike rack before the bike, as I had already bought my rack I saw a street sign advertising a bike sale.  I was just going to take a look when I tried all the bikes and the one that felt the best was this hot pink bike.  So, now I get to ride my hot pink bike, I will be stilling in pink, if I were to have a pink biking shirt, the entire I wish I was still 8 years old look would be going on strong.
