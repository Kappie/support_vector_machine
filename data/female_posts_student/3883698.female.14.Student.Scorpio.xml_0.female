Of thousands of years gone by  I’ve gone down every road crossed every bridge  And still I live like I have more time   Immortality  Is a funny thing  A lifetime passes  And still I dream  Of being someone else  Not I  Flowing on the wind  Soaring through the sky  Amid all the laughter  Amid all the joy  Apart of the sorrow  In every girl or boy   Death is another level  Another goal to reach  Spend some time in heaven its  Just another fort to breach
