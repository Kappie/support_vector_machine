I have so much stuff I have to make up for school. I'm never going to get caught up. Plus, a lot of people are stressing me out. I'm kind of glad break is coming. But, then I feel like I wont do anything all of break, and I wont get to hang out with people I want to.   Last night actually went really smoothly. I was surprised, but I was so tired by the time I got home. My mom let me go in after first hour since we weren't playing in Wind Ensemble anyway. It was nice to be able to sleep in, but once I got to school the stress just started all over again.   Bowling was like...the only fun part of my day. Actually, bowling and lunch. But, I sucked in my first game of bowling today. Wow...I just...wow. I don't want to talk about my 55. Haha. The second game I got a 103 though. That's three days in a row with a score above a 100. YEAH! Who's the bowling queen?   Erica gave me the greatest present today. Wow. It's amazing. It's this duck on wheels with a pull string, and these three push buttons that are different colors and have different letters on them, and it plays thirty different songs. It's SO amazing. Erica's like...my hero. Whooo!   So, sixth hour was fun. I was playing with that. :)  OK, I'm finally getting to finish this. I just got home from my trumpet lesson. YaY? I just sort of realized something too. I tend to tell all of my stressful problems to Stephen, and I don't even realize I'm doing it until halfway through the conversation, and then I feel really bad. It's terrible. I feel so dumb too. This is why I don't usually complain to people. I feel stupid when I complain. This is why I sort of complain in here, but like tonight...I culdn't have complained about what I needed to talk about in here. Oh well. I give up. I'm just making myself more angry. I think I'll go read some of The Taming of the Shrew.
