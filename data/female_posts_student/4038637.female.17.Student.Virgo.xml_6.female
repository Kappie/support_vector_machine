It's Not How You Make A Person Smile,      But Whether Or Not It's WorthWhile.        It's Not In The Conversation,        But In The Way You Listen.        It's Not In The Laughter,        But What Comes Before And Everything After.        The Key To Friendship..        Is Not In Two People Relating,        But In Two Hearts Communicating.        Thank You For Being That Very Special Friend,        Who Understands The Key To Friendship,        And How To Unlock Everything Within.
