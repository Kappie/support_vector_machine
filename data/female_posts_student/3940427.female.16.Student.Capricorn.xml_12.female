I can't wait to go and see them in September!! ^-^  I went to the Pet Expo at the fairgrounds today and I got to see a corgi there. There were lots of dogs. Hamlet the Great Dane was there, and I think I saw an Irish Wolfhound there that I'd seen before at the PKC. There was a Borzoi that kept leaning on me, so kyoot. X3 The Ferret Rescue was there too. FERRET!! *hug*  Aaanyway... I'll just shut up, hey?
