And... err... you promise to give me every second square of chocolate! *now  that  is evil!*) Well anyway... er... sooo I went shoe shopping! Yes, I hate it, it's the most boring thing! Yeay! And totally fruitless *pointless* because nothing was in my size... *god damn feeeeet!* I hate feet, believe me, if you had seen my brothers feet you would too! How do chiropracters do it? Do they all have their own personal psychiatrist or something...? I wonder if that's a special brand of psychiatry. But really, chiropracters should get paid loads!! Err anyway... well... I recon we should all be communist anyway :D Be a lot more fun! *Mind you the whole happy holdy hands and sing thing doesn't go too well with the vampires* *sigh* Oh well, we can only wait...
