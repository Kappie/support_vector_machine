On the 4th July, we're going to Malta (any fit Maltese boys out there?) and we're going to be there for like a week.  Then we're going to some crappy Indian wedding on the 18th July (my birthday.  It's bloody brilliant.  I'm going to have to wake up early, sit in a car for two hours, then pretend to be happy for two people I've never met :@ and I wasn't allowed this reeeeally purdy pink dress I saw in New Look).  My dad has to be a witness at this court case (truly crappy - I thought it would be some murder or something, but it's a sodding money fraud or something like that), but we're going to my mate Kit's house in Boston (can't wait - she's got a swimming pool, a "really cute" mate, it'll be really hot, America + summer = good times, and ... wow, I just can't wait).  Then we go to Santa Rosa to see ma grandma and grandpa.  And the Hello Kitty merchandise, and this really cool shop called Hot Topic (go on the webby, www.hottopic.com, it's really cool) but ... we're there out of love for my family ...  Oh God, I hope there isn't another family reunion again *glares at computer* that was REALLY dull.  It was this party thrown by these really rich cousins of ours, well, my mum's cousin, and it was soooo hot were they were.  They had a swimming pool, though, so that was cool.  But is it really worth being told by trillions of old people you haven't seen since you were a baby that you're taller, and by your first cousin's girlfriend of two years that your accent is really cute? (Grrr ... yours is cute too, Amy ...)  So anyway, yeah, can't wait for the summer!  It was sooo funny in Latin today, cuz some guy was "iratissimus", so Miss James goes, "What emotion was Marcus feeling?" and I whispered, "He was PISSED OFF." And she heard me, hahahaha.  She goes, "In polite English, please ..." She's such a goon.  She can't teach at all, lol.  Well, I suppose she can ... she just spends too long on some things, when we should be doing other things.  And I HAAAATE those stupid, stupid vocab tests.  There's no point!  She thinks we don't cheat, but every single time I'm telling Pooj all the answers.  Pooj, WHY won't you come online, I need to ask what Andrew's addy is ... and Clare's driving me round to blinking bend ...  Shut UP, I couldn't care less if Billy threw himself into a quarry, so WHY do I want to know how well his parent-teacher thing went?  Get over it, school isn't everything.    That's a good point, actually.  Parent-teacher meetings.  I allowed my parents to see Mr. Tightass, Mr. Hyde, Mr. Dougall, Mrs Marchant and Miss Imber.  I didn't even ask what the last two said.  According to Mr. Tightass, I could be in the top five if I tried (well, that's likely. *Snorts.*) and Mr. Dougall was very interested in this essay I wrote, that was just taking to mick out of my classmates and his homeworks.  He didn't know I read so much.  I just put down all the intellectual books that I've read, like Jane Eyre, Emma and Wuthering Heights ... blah blah blah.  Then Mr. Hyde spoils it all, by saying I'm doing "okay" but I talk too much.  Damn straight!  I'm crap at Science, and I'm crap at being quiet, so you can shove it where the sun don't shine, honey!   (Is this really wise to be putting on the Internet?  Teachers don't have lives do they?  They wouldn't find this, would they?  Oooh, I'm getting paranoid.)  Meh.  I'm going to go now.  I can't be arsed to write anymore.  Lool, has anyone seen that Kenan + Kel episode when they got that pen that says, "Time to write," when you click it, and it got stuck and it kept saying that over and over and then in the middle of the night they break into Kenan's parent's room and wake them up, and they go, "Do you have any idea what time it is?" and they've got the pen and it's still going and they go, "Um ... time to write?" It's sooooo funny.  *Clears throat and looks away sheepishly.*  Okay, I really will go now.  I expect you've all had enough of me.  (Who exactly reads this?  I know Sean and Pooj do, but I can't give the address to Clare, Charlotte and Mel, etc.  So unless random members of the public read this, then it's just us three against the world.  So why do I bother?  Oh well, it amuses me and it certainly amuses Pooj, lolol.  Pooj, remember, I gave him my best last night ... HAHAHAHAHAHA that is the the proper way to talk about your Maths teachers *tuts*.)  Ciaw darlings, see you all later. *~ Jools, mwah mwah ~*  Sean, are you on anything illegal? Love dollars?  You're ker-azee.    Hasn't anyone else noticed how freaky Zack de la Rocha is?  He scares me ...  Check out www.toothpastefordinner.com.  It's funny.    I truly am going now!  I swear! No wait, hold on, lemme paste some lyrics in ...  I wish I could drive away to the sunset Back to the day that we first met Only believe the things I wrote I'll put it in a note, yeah I'll cross my t's and dot my i's Better say hello, don't you dare say goodbye I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name P.S. I love you forever and today  Okay, I'm done.  I'm going.  I just love that song!! (Hint ... get the All-American Rejects album.  It's good!  Honest!)
