Pat came over to visit me while i was alone tonight. it was nice even though i look like a wreck. oh and josh came and visited for awhile. it was nice to have a little visit where i didnt get all bitchy and crazy on everyone. im proud of myself.  i have a good feeling that i will be able to sleep tonight! i dyed my hair to get rid of the memories of you and now im different and over it, or at least that is what i am telling myself. i am no longer going to dwell on you and what happened. ive had my share of heartache and remorse and ive had my share of dwelling for too long on those things. i am sick of letting myself get so caught up in you and yet i cant seem to let go. there is a part of me that makes me think that you will change your mind and suddenly everything will be okay and it will all make sense again. but i know im wrong, the more i think of the things that could happen the more unlikely they are to become true. i just wish that i knew why, i wish i knew what was going through your head and i wish i knew what is keeping this from working. and at the same time maybe it is all better off left unsaid and me not knowing, but the less i know the less likely i am to get over it. im trying to change myself and who i associate with to help me forget but its harder than you think, its harder than anyone thinks. some people move on quickly and some people can forget and i cant. i get attached easily, but not often, and once i am i cant let go... not until i get what i want out of it. you helped me get over my last problem with someone and now you become the next, its funny how that works. i just wish you would have given us a chance because i know that you cared and that you wanted it to, but something held you back. what? i dont know, but i wish it wasnt there i wish that i could have worked. but it didnt and i need to face that fact and move on. im trying. just give me time. goodnight -gabby --- its funny how i have conversations with people on here.
