My grandfather on my dad's side died last March. He was good for a few good laughs. He wore his pants up to his armpits. He used a walker and would always scrape it against the wood floor as he walked, so you could hear him coming from far away reminiscent of a horror movie soundtrack that foreshadowed impending doom. Also, he almost drowned me at my baptism when I was eight. My grandfather on my mother's side resides in Montana had occassionally drives down with my grandma to visit my parents. He likes to make comments about the damn environmentalists and how I will make a "real, good wife" some day. So, in spite of a sense of the obligation to love one's extended family, the bond is somewhat lacking.  A saavy business proposition would be a store called "Rent-A-Grandparent"...It would have the same premise as a "Rent-A-Center" in which you can rent televisions or furniture with the option of owning. A person could choose a grandparent to suit his or her own mood. Let's be honest, sometime one fancies the jovial grandpa reminiscent of Santa Claus and other times, one desires a bawdy old fart.  I already have my eyes set on my potential grandfather. He "taught" my Contracts course. I use the term "taught" loosely, because the course consisted merely of his anecdotes about how the best haircut he ever received took place under a tree in Nigeria or how he has all his suits custom-tailored in the Phillipines.  More intriguingly, I reveled in the stories that my fellow students related to me. One of my classmates happened to pull up next to our professor at a stop light, and they ended up drag-racing together. My professor, with pipe in mouth, decisively won the match-off.  Another time, my professor had been walking into class carrying approximately eight bottles of wine in his arms (Keep in mind, we have a no-alcohol policy on our campus). All of a sudden, the bottles slip out of his arms and all but one crash onto the floor. My professor stood with a disappointed look on his face and remarked, "Aw, my wine" and walked into the classroom, leaving others to clean up the large pool of glass and wine.
