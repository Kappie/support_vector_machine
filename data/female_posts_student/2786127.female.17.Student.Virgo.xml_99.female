I'm tired.   I'm tired of juggling people around. I'm tired of worrying about hurting anothers feelings by talking to someone else and i'm tired of walking on egg shells to make sure someone is not mad at me. I'm tired of having to fight for someones attention and getting to much attention from someone i don't want that much from.  I feel like everytime i turn around my life does a 180 on me. I've never had a stable life, a stable home, stable friends. My friends slip through my fingers like sand...it's so much work for me to pick them back up if they won't help me. I've tried for so long to keep all that stable, and, I'm tired.  I've never had a stable home. In the past five years i've lived in 5 different houses. The first home i miss. The second one my mom was drunk all the time, tried to commit suicide, and she was embarrassing. I hated that home. The third one my mom reclused to her room all the time, i had a stupid dog named Jerry who never got house trained, and it was the house where i saw my mom for the last time. The fourth was my dads rental house. It had amber in it, who eventually stole many of my things. The fifth one is where i am now, and i hate this house. its to manly, its to much my dad, and it doesn't feel like home.  along with all these different houses came so many different feelings and different friends. I'm sick of change. I just want to be stable.  I'm tired.  I want school to just start, then end, so i can get away from this place. I need to go start my own life, with my own rules. I want to be able to mold it the way i want it. God i need that so bad.
