I had an okay day considering I failed my spanish test. But.. track was good too. I hadda good laugh actually when I found out about something that went down on Friday. A RELE good laugh. But... yea now I'm talkin to Mickey about Notre Dame. OH YEA!! I didn't get a chance to tell you, my dad got the ND vs. FSU tickets!!!!! I can't wait! And what's gunna make it 10x betta? Mick is gunna be there!!!! I can't wait to see him you have no idea. Like we talk all the time about camp and stuff and its awsome I'm gunna get to see him in 29 days! AHH! lol... so yea.. I should be studying for my Chem test... but I'll do that inna bit. Track today was pretty good. I felt a lot better then I did yesterday. We did a really good 30 min with like no stopping and then some strides. Had PSAT class today, and that didn't go too well but not bad enough to really disappoint me. I had a great dinner so that's what probably boosted my spirits to make me happy (chicken cutlet, sald, mashed potato, and some spaghetti). Okay, that's it. I'm out, gonna talk to Mick and Ange some more and then go to bed. Night! x0x0x0x0x
