Madonna’s fame  was at its peak in the early 90s, with the release of her best selling greatest hits album “The Immaculate Collection” in 1990 and her infamous “Blond Ambition World Tour” that same year. She became even more notoriously famous with the release of her photo book “Sex” in 1992, which totally overshadowed her album release that same year.   “Erotica” was automatically  linked with her book “Sex” and was slaughtered by critics all over the world. “Erotica” was Madonna’s downfall and, though over 3 million copies where sold, considered a flop. She mustered a successful worldwide tour, based on “Erotica”, in 1993 named “The Girlie Show”, but yet the album was looked at as her worst effort so far, only surpassed by “Bedtime Stories” in 1994.   But “Erotica” was  too harshly treated and prejudged by her ventures outside the record studio and was never given a fear treatment. “Erotica” is perhaps Madonna’s most truthful artistic statement and though the title might seem a bit dubious, it has many qualities that show what she is good for. Only 4 out of 14 tracks is explicitly about sex, most of the songs is about love, understanding and the overall theme is about being non-judgemental.    The album  is also her greatest tribute to the gay community, maybe not in the style of the music, but in her lyrics. “Why’s It So Hard” is a song about mankind’s difficulty in accepting people who think and love differently. She addresses the issue of loosing close friends to AIDS in her highly personal ballad “In This Life”.    The very style  of the music is a bold choice for an artist who is famed for making streamlined pop and in retrospect one can see that “Erotica” was a sign for what was to come, her extraordinary comeback album “Ray of Light” in 1998. Madonna was experimenting with music in ways she had never done before and this was done quit successfully. The album is not “easy” to approach, it is an album one has to really listen to and let it grow on you. The main problem with “Erotica” is that it is a bit too long, all songs except one (“Bye Bye Baby”) goes on for over 5 minutes which can be a bit tedious in the long run.    “Erotica” is  like a good vintage red vine, it gets better and better as the years pass and is a hidden treasure in Madonna’s vast back catalogue.    urlLink The Official Madonna Site
