I remember feeling contempt for a certain boy when he dramatically wished for his old girlfriend back, saying those exact same words. I mean, people don't change, they grow. And it's the bane of the world to try and stop someone from changing, because then, they aren't growing, they're trying to get away from you.    I realized as soon as I'd said it that I really didn't mind that people change, it's just the initial shock that gets you in the beginning.     What I'm really feeling is a little jealous, that I really haven't grown socially in a while, and still, I can't see myself being very sexual at all. Am I going to be trapped in this androgoneous state forever? Honestly, when Grace tells me about her adventures, I'm part horrified, part facinated that she is so driven by this need that I don't have. It's frusterating to feel this way. I mean, I like guys, but I don't want to go out and "fuck everyone". I just don't feel it. Other girls, when they like somebody, they like them sexually too, but me, well, yeah. I don't want to complain, but what the hell, WHEN AM I GOING TO FEEL NORMAL?
