Drugs... drugs drugs drugs, like the pot in ricks coat. Nothing is ok, no drugs, no smokes... and the fact, i will probably end up having sex with a married 25 year old IS NOT OK! also... i think i may be developing a 'crush' persay on someone that i shouldnt. Whats wrong with me? i dont know how i feel, i think im lonely. I cant help but like anyone who may offer me some kind of attention. Like the guy at the butchers. Im not attractive, nor am i nice. Datable. No. Im me. im nothing.   please come now, i think im falling im holding on to all i think is safe...     But how can u convince someone who is so great, not to hurt themself. They dont realise how much they are fucking themselves up. Its not just them they are hurting. Me. Her friends. Her family.   it seems i've found the road to nowhere   and im trying to escape   i cry out "heaven save me" but im down to one last breath   and with it let me say... let me say...     Why do i push away people? sarah, lauren... now, reflecting back to canada, what the fuck was i doing to eric? oh my god... they took me in, cared for me, housed me, fed me... all for nothing, and yet, i fucked it all over. I want my journal back. I am a slut. a whore. Paul scott matt colton paul craig dave... dave with the big dick... big dick dave... scary eh. Memory sucks.   hold me now... im six feet from the edge and im thinkin   maybe six feet, aint so far down...     Well, i think thats about it from me. I dont believe anyone aside from me is reading this, and i think it should stay that way, but i dont know what to think. Damn you heart, cant u not care???    it would be easier to be heartless and not care, than to care this much and suffer the pain
