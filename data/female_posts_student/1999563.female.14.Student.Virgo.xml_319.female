Some times I get caught up in worrying about money or getting a new amp- since I don't have one, and I just waste all my energy on this stress and concern. And I'm telling you, it's empty and fickle. And no matter how much I ignore God, or try to write my own life, he's always there when I realize my blind eyes."  Joe is SO coool. Thats like my motto.  Today at school was mondo yucky. I didn't like it.  It was NOT FUN!  I was like, GET ME OUT OF HERE!  Then I went to tennis. It was pretty goood.  I made good friends. She told me her life story. It was sue-wheat. I love when people tell me things baout themselves. That may seem weird but everyone is like a closed book with thousands of locks on it.  I just want to know about you. It makes me think that they don't trust me with information about their lives...and that makes me sad.  Tomorrow I ge tot see falling up *yay* I get to meet Joe. Wahhoo!  I am kinda excited. But for now, I want to SLEEP!  Tomorrow I also must feed the poor so I am going to me gone for abit after school so I can't go to tennis. I hope it rains or else I will miss a game which is BAD!  Hmm...  Im trying to think of something somewhat inellegent to say, but alas, nothing smart has come from this lifeform today.  At least my english poster was pretty. And thats really all that counts in life, eh?  Speaking of Eh, my brother is coming back from canada tonight, Yippee!  Yeah. I think I am going to go to bed in like 20 minutes.  Oh! I talied up the scores for our NCAA comp. and Sara and I are tied! Moohaha! :)
