Mr. Weiss      :( I don't wannnaaaaaaa...I really like the book I'm reading now, and I just know that if I start that one, my mind will go *boom!* Especially because it looks really boring. But hey, I guess you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. (Sorry, that was dumb.)  Today was a pretty good day. The girls' retreat lead team filmed the commercial today, and I must say that I am no actress. I just can't wait until Sunday when we can see it! It's gonna be great. I've been talking to a guy from Alaska on MySpace, which is a friend network thingy. I saw that he was atheist, and I was just interested in understanding him, so I added him as one of my friends. We've sent a few e-mails back and forth, and I am pretty sure I understand him as much as I want to. I'm pretty sure he's one of those that is the way he is because he doesn't want to agree with anyone else. He wants to be unhappy. He wants to kill himself, because he thinks it's a beautiful thing. I know you're thinking, "Wow, Lisa, why would you talk to him after hearing that?" I could never do that... stop talking to someone just because of all that. And if they live in Alaska, that's far enough away for me. And he doesn't make me feel bad, he doesn't make me doubt my beliefs. So, why not? Okay, I guess I need to read :P I wonder if I could do it all in one day? Maybe... tomorrow? Tyson wants to see The Village with me tomorrow night, and I really want to see it to.  Right now I'm listening to Celebrity Jeopardy, and ....What is Light Urple? I'm gonna go. Bye Bye
