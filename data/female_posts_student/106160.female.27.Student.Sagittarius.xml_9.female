I ended up dropping one, adding another, dropping it, and adding yet another in its place during the drop-add period...but it's all set now (ARST1070, RGTE0199,  WMST1110...the RGTE is required :/). The only current hold up is the student loan. I was approved and they sent out a packet of stuff for me to sign, promissory note and such, but I went to their office that same day and signed duplicate papers instead to help expedite the process (supposedly). However, it keeps getting delayed. My check was supposed to be mailed on Monday at the latest but when I called today they said it would be mailed out on Friday. I'm just hoping that they did as they said and broke it up into 2 checks and that perhaps the one for fall will arrive first since no deductions are being taken from it (they are deducting the ~$500 I still owe for summer from the other one).  On a health-related note, I find that lately no amount of sleep seems to suffice for appeasing my perpetual weariness. Perhaps it is the weather...so horribly hot and sticky...it makes me feels as though I'm having an asthma attack at times when the air is so heavy that I struggle just to breathe. Then again, I suppose it could also be that I acclimated myself to napping in the midst of the afternoon over the brief break between semesters. Ah well...off to bed I go.
