We are storming all day, and while normally this would be cause for excitement at a day spent staring out the window (seriously), today, I would rather go to work than march. On the off chance that the sun does come out, it's already rained enough to make it hell with the bugs and mud and humidity. Mr. Taweel doesn't believe in coming in for a little rain, either, so unless there's a tornado or lightening strikes a Guard girl, we'll probably be outside.  I'll bet if it's lightning, we'll put down our poles and practice marching. Joy. And if we go inside, we can't practice in the band room. Mr. Gay replaced all the ceiling tiles we knocked holes in, damnit. I was proud. I had like three holes right in a little line! I knocked a piece of insulation out! You can't just erase my legacy! Anyway, since I'm pretty sure basketball camp is in the gym, that relegates us to the library, and last time we were there, Amanda broke a light. She totally killed it.  Ha, I know I was right, though, when I put an extra set of clothes in the Guard room, because now I don't have to be soaking wet, at least through lunch.  All my friends are starting school now, and it's depressing. It's a reminder that soon it's my turn. At least I've discovered the big secret: in order to have friends, you either have to be in band or go to church. Good thing: there are people in band I like talking to and stuff. Sad thing: there are people in band I want to smack on a daily basis. I always hate myself the day after I'm forced into a social situation. I do stupid, stupid things around people. I'm going to cut myself off...I don't want to start.  No emails. Again. I wrote Lauren yesterday, but she never replies until at least three days have passed, but the lack of reply from Dae is astonishing. Because I wrote her two days ago, she's had two chances to read and reply but she hasn't. Maybe she's been busy? I hope that's the case.  I think I'm doomed to be one of those people who's never happy. I only hope it's just with myself and not with other people. Which so far, is entirely correct. There are exactly two other people that I could never be (seriously) mad at, and when I'm around other people, I'm completely nonthreatening.  I need to start wearing more black. Or something. Because what happens is I get around people, go completely stupid and ditzy, I live very superficially, and I save all my emotions to write down...so I don't actually show any personality. Wow. I never thought of it like that, but that's exactly what I'm doing, I'm living vicariously through myself. Because of my obsessive need and want to remember what's happening in my life ten years down the road, I've stopped myself, effectively, from living.  My journal is way different from my blog anyway, here, I voice more insecurities and I tell more things, in my journal, I write exactly what happened and how I felt about it, nothing more. Because a journal is a physical object and can be read through by anybody, with a blog, only selective people even know it exsists, and I can get rid of it easily, as opposed to cutting it into pieces, burning it, and flushing the ashes.  So I should stop bringing it to school, focus less on writing it down and more on actually living it...but I still want to remember. I know SOME people hate high school, but I find it generally tolerable. I don't slack, I offer more than I should, I take on extra projects, I make cynical comments with my critic pal, who unfortunately got accepted to genius school. But while I want to deal with myself alone and live without stupid rules, since they're what I've got, I can't express dissatisfaction unless I know the best way to bring it down. I still haven't decided, though, if it's easier to get away with things as a good student. I mean, I can break MAJOR rules and nobody says anything, and I'm never anything more than reprimanded for smaller rules. Ha, I mean, I skipped art class to sit in the bathroom with my friend who was upset. I walk in during lunch and explain, and she changes the roll sheet and buzzes the office to tell them she just overlooked me, when the secretary there knew damn well what I was doing.  Wow. Tangents much?
