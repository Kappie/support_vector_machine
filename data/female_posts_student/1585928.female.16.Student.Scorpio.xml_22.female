I was on the phone so Julie went and asked some nigger if they had it and he was like 'nahh we done sold out of it' and so she was like 'ohh, ok' and I was like yea right! they have to have it! so we went and asked a different nigger and she was like 'yes its right over here' and she went and got it!, we were like wtf?... so we went and checked out in that line with the guy that told us it was sold out! and he was like 'did yall find everything ok?' and I was like 'yep, we found the "sold out" movie we were looking for', and he was like 'ohhh yall found one?' and we were like 'yea, sitting with the other 30', haha but anyways! OmG!! guess who called tonight? JOSH!!! yea... Josh Wilkinson called me! it was extremely odd!!, He was askin me what happened betweeen us and what he did wrong and all this, and I was like,' do you not remember the rodeo incident?', and he was like 'yea', and I was like 'ok, well it don't much matter to me anymore, I'm over it all!, and I still want to be friends with you', and everything was fine and then he was like 'so why didn't you come and see me any while I was down?' and I was like 'cause I thought you hated me' and he was like 'no I just figured you didn't wanna talk to me or see me, cause you had that other guy' and I was like 'um.... No! I didn't have any guy!' and so we argued about that for a lil bit! then I had to go so he said he would call me tomorrow and we would talk about everything, and he said he didn't hate me!.. so I guess things are a little better, at least we are going to try to fix things!~*...  but anyways.. so after Wal-Mart we went up to the bowling alley, LOL!!, we went up there to see Brenton and Jarrod(FaTtY)! it was actually pretty funN!, I love those guys!!, we met Jarrod's brother, Jeremy, he was cool too!.. oh today is amanda's birthday!! Happy Birthday!!! I love you girl, I can't wait til Friday night, we're gonna have sooo much funn!! ...but anyways I'm about to go, byee!~*
