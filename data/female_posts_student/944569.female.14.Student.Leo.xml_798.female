No, the blackout did not affect minden because of camp magic. I got my Bronze star in swimming and level 1 in widsurfing, level 4 in archery and more. I am now obsessed with making hemp bracelets. Camp is magical.The unecessary swearing, the throwing of knives... I came back yesterday. and i find out i have something to go to tonight and a wedding to go to tomorrow night. But hey, an extra week off of school. bye for now
