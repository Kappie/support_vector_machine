INSOLENT! mom, I was weeping! and you call me insolent! i felt and still feel so VERLETZLICH. i would like someone to support me, be nice to me, hug me when i need it and say "everything´s gonna be ok. don´t go to school today, you look horrible, darling." *smile* "go back to bed. i´m gonna call the principal and tell her you´ll be absent today." BUT YOU SAY: "get up, take a shower. you´ll feel better." then when you came back you said "if you stay at home you´ll miss lessons. how are you going to make it up? just tell me how? and what about the matura? you´ve got to think about your future. i just don´t understand how such behaviour is possible."  i´m crying as i am writing this. truly am and i just can´t understand how a person can be so...is there a word that describes that? some kind of materialistic maybe?  you hurt me even more, i wanted to get out, just get out  be far away from you. i prefered to get a bunch of bad marks than stay one more minute with you. i just don´t understand - maybe you didn´t see that i was crying? maybe you thought i had red eyes because i was tired? they call them TEARS and SOBS, mom! i feel unbelieabvably hurt. i have never felt more hurt in my life before. never more ashamed of my behaviour towards s.b. i was revealing my true feelings in front of you and you hurt me even more by saying "that i was as insolent as usual the night before." how could you?  this is the worst day of my life so far i think. i hate my ugly character - the things an ugly, weak character causes make people hate themselves and regret. this is what i feel now.  what hurt me a bit more - actually: did it really hurt me then? it was a bad definition of my behaviour - was before you left for upstairs. YOU said: "this strange behaviour yesterday night [when you wanted to go out for a walk] and this morning makes you unberechenbar." I was..i duuno, first couldn´t believe what i heard so i found that the only objective, non-provoking answer i could give was: "if you say so." but then she said: "it´s the truth." i just looked at her and left. i didn´t know what to answer to that. it was too...how-to-call-it...too much for me.
