In my mind, I believe that Willard does judge Kurtz in numerous ways. One of the was in which he judges Kurtz is when he was first sent on the mission to find and kill him, Willard thought to himself why would they want to kill an officer who was one of the best there was. He thought that Kurtz might have gone crazy from being in the jungle too long and it was not safe to have him around. Kurtz was building a society which worshiped him. Another way in which Willard judges Kurtz is when he sees a bunch of dead beheaded bodies laying around and thinks why would someone do this. I also do judge Kurtz because of what he did. He was one of the best in the military but he chose to lead a group of people in Cambodia instead. He also sacrifices and beheads his own worshipers which does not go well with me. So I believe that Willard does judge Kurtz as I do.
