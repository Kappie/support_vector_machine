He took my breath away. Dear Diary, I can't get him off my mind and it scares me 'cause I've never felt this way. No one in this world knows me better than you do, so diary I confide in you. Dear Diary, Today I saw that boy. As he walked by I thought he smiled at me. And I wondered does he know what's in my heart? I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe. Should I tell him how I feel or would that scare him away? So Diary, tell me what to do, please tell me what to say. Dear Diary, One touch of his hand now I can't wait to see that boy again. He smiled and I thought my heart could fly. Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends? Yeah oh, I've got a feeling we'll be so much more than friends. oh yeah.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Isn't that beautiful? How i wish i can put this song in this webbie.. but unfortunaly.. i don noe how to do it...  so if anyone noes how to put songs in this website to be heard.. please tell me how... Thanks!
