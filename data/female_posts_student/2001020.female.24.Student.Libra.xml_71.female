I just know that I'm heavy.  I went to hang out with J and B to watch some Monday night football with them.  It was nice to talk to some guys who respect me and care about me, and would never hurt me intentionally...or even unintentionally, for that matter.  Why is it that my friends are so good to me and I have so many friends, but there are those few who fall outside of the spectrum and they just can't treat me the way I deserve to be treated?  My friends at school treat me like a queen, and I, of course, treat them accordingly.  I treat everyone with such respect...and that's what I get in return.  But X, why doesn't he see that?  Why doesn't he see what everyone else sees?  On Friday, I asked him, "C tells me that everyone in the school seems to want me, and yet, you have me, and you don't want me."  And he made this face like, "Are you crazy?  Of course I want you," and I think he said something like, "Whaaaat?" maybe.  I don't know.  I just can't expect much of him, I can't.  I knew what I was getting into and I can't expect to be the girlfriend.  But can I get something?  Why am I agonizing over this?  It's nothing and it never will be anything!  I knew that from the get-go!  So why?  Why did I willingly entangle myself in this?  For lust?  For hopefully one day?  If someone would've told me this was where things would be 2 months later, I honestly STILL wouldn't have done anything differently!  Why am I so damn self-destructive?
