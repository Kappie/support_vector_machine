We stayed like 10 minutes and left. The DJ was too "down" with our "scene", the people were uptight and had gel in their hairs, and the punch was suger free and made from jello mix. We went to the portal where we saw all my homies I know through Josh Wakemen.. whom I met the weekend before.  So we talked there for an hour or so, then went to Denny's and talked for an hour or so. Then a few of us went to a park somewhere, and Daniel assembled his Arabian Water Bong with the exacting mastery of a sniper deconstructing and reconstructing his boom stick.  Speaking of boom sticks, I watched Army of Darkness again last night. AWESOME MOVIE. Josh Moore came over after bible study and we gave it a whirl... one of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when a demon infested chick starts going crazy inside of the S Mart, and Ash gets up on the counter with a shotgun and goes:   Ash: "Lady... I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.."  Demon-infested chick: "Who the hell are you!?"  Ash: "Name's Ash... Housewares..." - cocks shotgun  *boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom*  Awesome, completely ingenius.  Tonight I met Daniel again, a bunch of his church peeps were at the portal and we went and saw Kill Bill. I now have this fear of being decapitated through unnatural means. I don't know the phobia name for it.  This week has been less then so cool. I'm really tired when I wake up in the morning... jogging at 7am now- its getting old. I'm supposed to be doing it with my dad, but he's not even there 1/3 of the time. So like, this morning when I got back from jogging, I took a nap. From around 9am to uhh... 1:40pm. Yeah. Very bad. So I called to cancel my voice lesson. Very very very bad.  My sister Chrystal is down here. She's going to see my sister Bre in cali. My dad left too, and my mom's been gone so naturally, I've been playing Counter-Strike with my fellow clan CareBear teammates. BREANNA: thank you for the CareBear theme song you sent me! I've been playing it into my mic when I join servers. People say it sounds like crap! Its precious.  Umm.. as long as I'm being random, I found some software to help me structure my Novel. It's cool...  pretty cool ... it has a bug though, the company hasn't emailed me back about it.  Also, I really hope my new band thing glues together. If its going to happen, then I have to be the glue.   Life is about to get painful... I can feel it.  I'm not seizing enough of my blessings.  Duck and cover!! OH well, I have to write a shallow entry now and again.. if only to keep contrast.  ------------------------------------------------------------  "Good... bad... I'm the guy with the gun." - Ash,  Army of Darkness
