Thats petty and juvenile.  Personally, I am above that.  When someone is a different person every day of the week, or when its convenient to be something different it makes it hard to maintain a friendship.  I've learned that the hardway through a couple different friends.  I dont turn my back on them entirely, but there comes a point where I need to tell myself: enough of the bullshit, its never gonna right itsself no matter how many eggshells you walk on or how involved or indifferent you act towards it.    I am finally happy in life: I have great friends, I have an amazing boyfriend (who oddly enough is a friend, not just some random fly-by-night person who came out of nowhere), my family surrounds me and I have a job, which while I don't always love it, pays the bills.  I'm in the midst of starting my own business and the last week has seen gigantic leaps and bounds on that front, so that it  WILL  be a reality by January.  Thats not a wish, its a fact.    I also heard some awesome news about  urlLink one of my favorite Ohesians  (Congrats, hun!)  Finally I'd like to share one piece of advice I've learned from my Nana, and I've discovered as of late its true.  Now I can't word it as eloquent or sagely as she did, but I can give you the gist of it:  If you're going to be miserable and spend all your time complaining, bitching and just being miserable to people, you're going to find yourself surrounded by nothing but misery and poop.  If you take all that negative energy you're spreading and try to make it positive you'll realize that eventually all around you will start to become positive.  Take charge of your own life, don't bitch that you're victim to circumstance and you'll be able to "become who you were born to be"(my Nana didn't say that, but it fit with my schpeil).   Happy, Healthy, Safe  Lovely Thanksgiving to all of you guys and your families and friends.  May you be blessed with full bellies, warm beds to nap in afterwards and a delicious array of pies and deserts.  Take care, smooshies!
