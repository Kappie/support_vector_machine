Water kisses her freckles, sand hugs his hair She glances over, just as the sun turnes a ruby red His eyes glimmer with sun and love. She nods, and agrees- it is beautiful. She takes her small white hand, and squeezes it. Laying her head on his shoulder, she breathes in. Dont forget to fall in love, she will later tell their children, don't forget.
