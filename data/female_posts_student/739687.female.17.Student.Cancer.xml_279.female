It is plain, in it's monotonous hues of black and white. I fall asleep to wake up on a bare mattress in a dark room, as a result of my own laziness and lack of concern for anything around me. I sit around and reminisce about the past, and it's vibrant colors that used to illuminate this empty world I'm living in. I am not depressed. I am not sad and discontent in the world. I'm just looking for a little more excitement.  I think I'll go open the curtains, and let some light in.  I found some old memories in file cabinets near the windows.  I let some color seep through the blinds.  There is optimism in the sky today. But I don't feel very lucky. Maybe tomorrow I can match the mood of the rest of the world.  Maybe the vibrant colors will soak through my skin.  Maybe I will mix into the palate of blues and greens.  And my world will not be so grey.   Bye crazies.
