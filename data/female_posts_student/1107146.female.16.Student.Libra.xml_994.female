May not even go to San Antonio for Spring Break, which would totally suck.  And my mom is insisting on staying home with me next week, even though she was supposed to go to Florida with my dad.  I feel like I'm screwing everyone's life up.  God, I shouldn't have gone out to eat last night.  I got so much worse.  Today I slept until 6:15 pm or so.  But I do know Algebra.  My daddy caught me up to where I should be.  Now I only lack Chemistry, Euro AP, Spanish, English, and Choir.  Yay.  And I can't even sit up for more than five minutes.  Sorry.  I'll quit complaining now.  It's just that I'm out of the loop socially and academically, and it's really frustrating me.  I don't know what's going on anywhere.  I'm a people person and the only people I have seen in the past month are my family and Abby.  I think I'm going to die if I don't get some social time soon.  Which could be a big problem considering I can't leave my house, especially since I went out for like 30 minutes last night and wound up bed-ridden.  Ugh.  Josh, thanks for checking the blog out for me.  Appreciate it.  I only get like 5 or 10 minutes on the computer every day because it's exhausting.  Yeah, I know, I know. I'm sitting down, so what's the big deal?  I don't know.  It just happens.  Anyway, so I don't want to spend all my time trying to fix something that I don't know anything about.  So anyway, I don't know if I'll actually see yall this month at school or not.  But you're welcome to come visit.  But yall have lives, so you don't have to.  I'll see yall later.
