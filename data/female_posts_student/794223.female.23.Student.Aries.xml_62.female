I've been having severe burning and cramping for about a week now; at first I was really confused, because when that happens it's usually the result of my tummy being in the tropics ;-D I hope that it's not an ulcer, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was--we've all been under quite a bit of stress these past couple of months.  Maybe it's a delayed reaction to my very stressful last semester at UT, and not just all this mess with Brandi.  Speaking of my cousin, she came home yesterday.  She's doing great, but is suffering from some severe headaches.  (For obvious reasons)  The nurses assured her that the headaches were normal due to the fact that the surgeon had cut through so many nerves; that, and the head brace they put on her to keep her head in place while in surgery.  I've got the student ILASSA conference this weekend, where I'm going to present my thesis--but I'm planning on heading down to East Bernard (or as Opa so affectionately calls it, East Barn Yard) some time after that.  I've got a doctor's appointment later on this afternoon.  In the meantime, I'm going to go lay down and try and get some rest.
