Of course, I have no idea what is considered "Average", but I guess I have always felt I was above average. It's nice to know I may be correct in that assumption. *GRIN*   "Congratulations, Dana! Your IQ score is 131   urlLink    This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others. Your Intellectual Type is Facts Curator. This means you are highly intelligent and have picked up an impressive and unique collection of facts and figures over the years. You've got a remarkable vocabulary and exceptional math skills â€” which puts you in the same class as brainiacs like Bill Gates. And that's just some of what we know about you from your test results. "   Of course, because it was one of those advertisements that pop up, I have to pay to get my "FULL" test results and what they mean, but I don't really care to know all that much. But, you know, it's nice to know that my neverending quest as an eternal student has paid off in my intelligence! *GRIN*  On a different note, I AM ALMOST DONE WITH SUMMER TERM! Hallelujah and pass the popcorn! I just have to take one more test and submit 5 more online assignments by Monday and I can take a breather until fall starts on the 25th. Yea.
