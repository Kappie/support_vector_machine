So I got up at 6 am after having 12 people from Singapore at Barbieri my hostel last night, who refused to follow the rules and chose to talk in rather loud abrasive voices around 4 am when everyone else is supposed to sleep.  Actually they talked all night long, repacking bags, turning on lights, apparently telling jokes from the raucous, incessant laughter.  I´ll give you one guess whose room they were in?!  Lots of fun, so after I got up at the crack of dawn to do the dean a favor, and while I was entirely exhausted I waited at the airport, at the right gate and everything after riding the metro and changing lines three times.  By 11:30 they hadn´t shown from their 9:25 arrival which was apparently on time.  I met a nice older taxi driver who waited with me and agreed to cut the rate.  At this point I was so worn down even I couldn´t have made it to the damn train station to get out here.  So I left, and paid 100 euros, horrifying I know to get here from Barajas Airport.  It was wretched.  The cab driver was nice, but the situation sucked for me.  I waited and did all I could and had signs and all.  I got here and they were like where are Amy and Karen?  I told them what happened and I had waited and nothing.  The people running the show from St. Thomas were nice and understood but the woman at the front desk was less than nice.  She said they had a cab driver for me when I arrived today the 29th of May.  I was like dude I got her days ago I never said I was going to arrive at the airport today from the US, you even have my itenerary.  The cab driver they ordered was all mad I still hadn´t slept but a couple hours, and I explained i was supposed to get the girls from the airport per request of Dean Piatt, but to no avail.  Nobody ever asked to hotel/program to order one.  So apparently they had assumed alot and after making assumptions even with knowledge to the contrary, they acted on idiotic proven wrong assumptions without telling us.  When they tell you, you have to find your own way to San Lorenzo, why would anyone in their right damned mind think a f%$·ing cab was ordered for them.  I told them to yell at me tomorrow I was too tired today.  I think being nice is going to be a trait I seek to lose asap.  I am fed-up.  So genius me, I unload all my stuff and decide to take a walk and wander a bit.  Oh, wait, the best part is the stupid girls don´t arrive until tomorrow, their plane is for the 30th!!!!  Wow can´t believe I forgot to mention that before.  Anyway.  I am already just about at my wits end.  At least the cab driver was really nice.  I got to talk about my boyfriend alot, he was like a sweet little old daddy-kind of man.  And, he carried all my stuff inside for me and was particularly careful with my wheelie, he whispered that this bag had my laptop in it and so when we got inside he made me stand by it.  Anyway my room is pretty nice, I dunno if I would call it three stars, not really sure it deserves any stars, especially the front desk, but at least I had a nice walk although the rain started and idiot me forgot an umbrella again.  Oh well I just heard someone in this internet café say they were from St. Thomas, apparently all the people in here are from there, ahh the light at the end of the tunnel has shown itself, I was waiting. I miss you A.
