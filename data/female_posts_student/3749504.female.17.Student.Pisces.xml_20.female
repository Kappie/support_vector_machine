We went to see The Terminal, which was very good, but I found some parts a little long (although, in retrospect, they weren’t long  or  boring; I just had to pee really badly at the time and my kidneys hurt). Some aspects were quite amusing, and Spielberg certainly played to his abilities, but it wasn’t a new masterpiece of his. However, I highly recommend this movie as Hanks and Spielberg are an incredible team, no matter what the premise.  After the movie, it was 9:45, and the closest fast food place – Arby’s – was just closing as we drove by (I preformed an illegal U-turn in order to discover IT WAS CLOSED, what a waste of a useful spy move) and all hope seemed lost…until, nearly out of Bend, we discovered a vastly unknown Taco Time sitting in a little-known strip mall. The brazen lights just barely grazed my eye line as I realized that no more innocents need to turn to dark, sordid McDonald’s Adult Happy Meals at 10:30 p.m., as Taco Time is open until “1:00 a.m. Or Later.” Two complaints only: Pepsi products. Who the hell wants to drink Pepsi products, and if you’re going to have  only  Pepsi shit in your “restaurant” at least stock DR. PEPPER, the only good Pepsi product. My other complaint is regarding their “Cinnamon Twists,” which are in reality stale styrofoam corkscrews of pale taste and no flavor.
