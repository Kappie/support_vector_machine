Catherine Zeta-Jones looked beautiful and very un-pregnant, I just hope I have as much money has her when I need to lose the fat after a baby Best Supporting Actor - Tim Robbins (Mystic River) loved the end of his speech about all victims of abuse getting help!  (And by the way, the commercials during the Oscars are very much outshining the Superbowl's commercials... what do you have to say about that?)  Love Ian McKellan - hate the hair cut Love Return of the King - my favorite front runner, although I love all the movies this year  Angelina Jolie - still one of my favorite actresses - looked amazing... and happy for once Art Direction (they should do this during the pre-awards show - I know they all deserve credit but your average viewer doesn't give a crap - I hope my mother never reads this....) - Grant Major (LOTR Return of the King) Three guys speaking... don't care... get off the stage  Billy Crystal and small man hiding behind him... ROBIN WILLIAMS!  Love him.  Cracking me up! Best Animated Feature - Finding Nemo (I am writing this before they announce the winner so I could be wrong...) I WAS SO RIGHT!!! HAHA!!! I AM A GENIUS!!!  Love Andrew Stanton - loved him playing Crush.... Loved that movie... I need to buy that movie....  Missed a few things... Pizza came....  Rene looks great - Costume design - LOTR Return of the King  In case anyone was wondering... this pizza is really good  Nicolas Cage looks... like he always does Saw Master and Commander on the plane to L.A., it was okay... decent, Russell Crowe is always really good but I am really glad his arrogant ass wasn't nominated this year  Chris Cooper - weird guy - good actor Best Supporting Actress - Rene Zellweger (Cold Mountain) was her dress cutting off her circulation?  Cause she sounded out of breath the entire speech  Tom Hanks... love him... love him... love him... Is this a tribute to Bob Hope to the Forrest Gump theme?  Interesting... and a tear jerker....  LOVE OWEN AND BEN TOGETHER!!!!   Best Live Action Short... again... who the hell cares.... Two Soldiers....  Alan Silvestri worked on this?  I love him... amazing movie composer.... Haha!  First guy to get kicked off stage with music... AND... the other guy never got to speak... and did he do some mention of war or something... I hate that....  Still Owen and Ben... still funny... Best Animation Short - Harvie Krumpet (don't care) Oh he thanked his boyfriend... I love that....  Liv Tyler has looked better Allison Kraus looks awesome, sounds awesome, Sting looks and sounds awesome and I assume is actually playing the instrument in his hand and not just moving his hand around next to it... not quite sure what it is... it looks like a ukelele (sp?) but not.... (song from Cold Mountain) Okay... another song from Cold Mountain... and sung again by Allison Kraus... with Elvis Costello (not singing) and some chick doing harmonies.... very pretty but if I wanted to hear all of this I would've bought the soundtrack.... but definitely the first time (at least that I can remember) that mechanism was fit into a song... and stood out... and sounded bad.... mechanism is just not one of those words you put in a ballad Annie Lennox - Into the Mist (LOTR - Return of the King) - beautiful song, beautiful voice, ugly woman....scary woman  Mrs. Billy Crystal... so funny....  Will and Jada Pinket Smith - beautiful and beautiful Special Effects - LOTR - Return of the King  Jennifer Garner - Looks awesome... too bad the new boyfriend isn't around cause he's way hotter! Running through winners of scientific and technical awards.... boring.... did it on Valentines Day... how lame  Jim Carrey is on the stage at the Oscars... have I missed this before???  Oh my God, he's talking about his sister having sex...  ok, I usually find Jim Carrey to be funny but he seems nervous and like a fish out of water on this stage...  Oh.... Breakfast at Tiffanys.... I love Audrey... my favorite movie... whoever this Blake Edwards is... I now love him because he was somehow associated with Breakfast at Tiffanys.  Bill Murray... funny... introduced nominated film Lost in Translation  Scarlett Johansen (sp?) looks fantastic... best makeup or something.... LOTR - Return of the King Again, two guys babbling... don't care... bored... get off the stage  Sandra Bullock and John Travolta dancing onto the stage - Sound Mixing - LOTR - Return of the King Normally I would say I don't care much about this but the truth is I am studying composing and sound mixing from the composer's aspect in Intro to Film Scoring... so this is kind of interesting to me... especially since we just finished studying the music and sound mixing in the first LOTR movie Sound Editing - actually Sandra and John are kind of amusing together - again, this is a category I find slightly interesting... Richard King, Master and Commander - Far Side of the World...  Billy Crystal - It's official, there is no one left in New Zealand to thank.... :)  Julia Roberts looks awesome... as usual  Oh it's the dead people reel.  I hate to say it like this cause the reel always brings a tear to my eye but still, you can't go through an Oscar show without the dead people reel.... okay is this a dead people reel of Katherine Hepburn... what about all the other dead people?  Where are they?  Aren't they just as important?  "All my life I've stayed at parties because I didn't know when it was time to go...."  I like that line.  I like Kathryn... I don't know why I've always compared her to Audrey, probably because of the last name, but I do like Kathryn.... okay aparently there will not be more of the dead people honored....  Oprah... Goddess and future president... and a woman I wish I knew... introducing Mystic River.... and just reaffirming my faith that she is one of the most articulate women I've ever heard speak  Diane Lane and OH YAY - JOHN CUSACK!!! LOVE HIM!!!  And he looks adorable... as he always does...  Best Documentary Short Subject - Chernobyl Heart  Naomi Watts and Alec Baldwin - Naomi looks great... haven't decided my opinion on her though... Alec is one of the best actors I think... he can play almost anything.... Best Documentary Feature - The Fog of War  President of Oscar Association.... messing up his speech.... boring.... move on.... New Dead People Reel...  Gregory Peck, Wendy Hiller, David Hemmings, Hope Lange, George Axelrod, Charles Bronson, Michael Jeter, David Newman, Ron O'Neal, Art Carney, Elia Kazan, Leni Riefenstahl, Karen Morley, Buddy Ebsen, John Schlesinger, Stan Brakhage, Ray Stark, Andrew J. Kuehn, John Ritter, Hume Cronyn, Buddy Hacket, Michael Kamen, John Greggory Dune, Robert Stack, Alan Bates, Gregory Hines, Jack Elam, Jeanne Crain, Ann Miller, Donald O'Connor.... phew.... that took some effort to do that so quickly....  Tiger Woods and Caddyshack Gopher takeoff commercial... quite humorous... I like it...   Sting and Phil Collins... this should make good South Park material later.... Ooooh Best Original Score... I love this category... Howard Shore better win, that's all I have to say.... WOOOHOOOO!!!!  HOWARD SHORE BABY!!! LOVE HIM!!!  BERKLEE ALUMNI!!! LOVE IT!!!!  And that was before they had a film scoring department.... none of you know the kind of pressure film composers go through... as much as I love the idea I don't think I could do it.... I would crack under the pressure.... they, if they are lucky, might have two weeks to compose and entire film's music....  Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore... ehhh... like them.... Film Editing - LOTR - Return of the King  Jamie Lee Curtis... dad's probably gone to bed but if he hasn't he might be very happy right now because it looks like Jamie's boobs are about to pop out of her dress.... Mighty Wind's A Kiss At the End of the Rainbow... nominated Song.... Eugene Levy and Catherine O Hara.... playing their characters Mitch and Mickey.... I liked A Mighty Wind... I kind of like this song... it sounds like something I might sing my kid to sleep with.... if I had a kid.... little William or little Arden.... in my big house with my recording studio in the building next to the house on my Malibu Beachfront lot... oh right, we're talking about the Oscars... not my fantasy world.... I didn't know that Annette O'Toole and Michael McKeon had written this... that explains why I saw them at the Grammys with Eugene Levy... Annette looks gorgeous by the way... much better than she does on Smallville... although I love her on that too.... Bellville Ron de Vu?  I have no idea how to spell this - from the Triplets of Bellville (animated film) fun song... never heard it before... not sure who is singing it.... ok.... I hope this doesn't win.... just cause as much as I like the tune I don't understand a word she is saying and I hate that because I think she is singing in english... it would be one thing if she were singing in french....  Oooh Will Ferrel and Jack Black are coming up!  yay!  Oh a shot of John Cusack giggling at Jack Black on stage... priceless... love him  Oh my God I am cracking up!  Jack Black and Will Ferrel singing the words to the song that cuts off your too long speech... oh this was too funny... Oooh I am crying that was so funny... love them.... Best Original Song - Into the West (LOTR - Return of the King) Howard Shore (YAY!) and Annie Lennox and some chick I don't remember..... Fran Walsh, that is her name.... oh the bastard music director tried to not let Fran Walsh speak... asshole.  Also, I loved that Annie Lennox thanked Michael Kamen... another amazing Film Composer.  Charlize actually doesn't look as good as she normally does.  I think it's the fact that her hair looks like a frizzy triangle Best Foreign Language Film - Barbarian Invasions.... haha... the woman who is speaking is happy LOTR wasn't an option for winning that category...  Uma Thurman and Jude Law.... Just get Uma off the stage... I just want to stare and listen to Jude... what is this category again?  Who cares.... oh Jude is going to leave the stage... wait... Jude... I love you... Come back!.... Cinematography (sp?) - Master and Commander And by the way, what the freak is Uma wearing... did she lose all fashion sense when she and Ethan called it quits?  BRING JUDE BACK!    Tobey Maguire is coming up!  My dog's namesake!  Or not actually my dog anymore.... ok, now I'm gonna cry, I miss Tobey so much.... think of happier things... God Dammit!  Okay, better now, kind of...Jude Law, Jude LAw, Jude Law, Jude Law.... goddammit, now they are shoing a commercial about a lost dog taking a trip across America and finally getting home to it's owners.... DAMMIT!  How is this supposed to make me stop crying?  BASTARD TELEVISION!  I miss my puppy....  Alias and the Practice are all new next Sunday... that makes me a bit happier....  Sophia and Francis Ford Coppola (probably butchered that name too) father and daughter team... playing off of The Godfather... Okay, Sophia should never be a public speaker Best Adapted Screenplay - LOTR - Return of the King  TOBEY!!! Not crying... Tobey Maguire... not my dog... I love his voice... I don't know why but I do.... Introducing Seabiscuit... loved that movie... although Tobey looks bad with the red hair....  Tim Robbins and Susan Surrandon - Love them as a couple - love them both individually... Best Original Screenplay - I do know that LOTR will not win this as they are not nominated :) - Sophia Copola (Lost in Translation)  Nic Cage, I don't think I have ever seen him look that happy before... and her father is so proud!    Okay, this is when the thing needs to just wind down... it's done...  I like this photo commercial with Martin Scorsece (butchered that name)   Tom Cruise... with Nicole Kidman right in the front... nice.... I think Tom is a great actor, like his movies, do not like him.... Best Director - Peter Jackson (LOTR - Return of the King) Awesome!  So excited!  I love him!  I loved the movie!    Adrian Brody... no kissing Halle Berry tonight... like his acting... don't know what else I think about it... haha, restraining order jokes are funny.... loved the binaca move... Adrian is good at making fun of himself... ok I like him.... Best Actress - Charlize Theron (love her!)  So happy for her.  I haven't seen the movie yet but I have heard nothing but good things about her performance.  Oh, and I like it when they tear up... although the Halle Berry crying fest was possibly WAY too much!  Oh!  I loved her speech!  That was the best speech!  I teared up too much when she thanked her mom... if I ever won an Oscar or Grammy or what-have-you I would thank my mom the same way....  Nichole Kidman looks wonderful as usual.... Best Actor... I want Johnny Depp to win although I know someone else will get it.  Ben Kingsley will probably get it, or Bill Murray, oh... Jude Law wouldn't be so bad either but as much as I love him I sitll want Johnny Depp to get it over him... WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?  And Sean Penn was good but I didn't think he was amazing... he kind of paled in comparison to how good Tim Robbins was. Best Actor - Sean Penn - okay so the guy has been nominated four times.... oh JUDE AND JOHNNY ARE STANDING FOR HIM!  I love it!  I love them!  I guess it's okay that he won.  I find it endearing that he didn't write a speech and at the same time annoying... you at least need guidelines, just a few notes... then there aren't any awkward pauses...  Steven Spielberg (butchered name?) - I just love him.  This man could come out, tell everyone to fuck off, and I would still love him.... Best Motion Picture - LOTR better win.... that's all I have to say.... WHOOOOHOOOOO I WIN!!!!!  They took the gold!  11 Oscars that night!  Tied the record with Titanic and Ben Hur!!!  Love it!!!  Love the movie!!!  So happy they won!  Now I feel vindicated that I stayed up and watched this whole award show all friggin night....  Have they had the winners flood the stage at the end before?  Did I just miss this in past years?  Interesting...  Well whatever... goodnight... I am going to bed....
