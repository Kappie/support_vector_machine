If I want to scream with fright I can, can't I? Can I miss someone? Could I actually go that far? Do I really feel attached to that person that I wish to be with them forever more? But feelings change. Maybe for the worse. There is always the chance that you'll be pushed away. Slammed against the walls of rejection. With no mercy for your heart. The person you feel so dear about doesn't even know what type of pain they have put upon you. But you can't tell how they feel. You can't even begin to guess. The only way you know is if they say so. But are you even ready to take that chance? Are you ready to fail?
