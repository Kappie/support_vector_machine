Usually I don't cry when I'm listening to music, especially political music, but I felt like crying my little eyeballs out. And it took me a second to figure out why, but then it dawned on me. I was scared.   I was scared because I was suddenly fully aware that I don't have a lot of control over what the government does. I'm just a kid, and Dubya has the power to blow us up. He's a fucking moron, and usually I laugh at morons. But this moron has an immense amount of POWER over so many lives, including mine, to a certain extent. And I'm scared. What if he get's elected this year, or, like in 2000, he's appointed by the Supreme Court again? Then there's another four years of being scared shitless. Another four years of this moron destroying Iraq, another four years of the PATRIOT Act making it possible for him andhis little minionsto tap my conversations and take things out of context, possibly making me seem like a terrorist, another four years of no (rich) child being left behind. That's why I was scared.   But I've been doing a lot of thinking since them. I'm still scared, no doubt, but I have some hope. Alone, I have very little power over the government. But there are others who agree with me, and if I contribute to their cause, then maybe we can make a difference. But that means I can't be the little 14 year old who types in a blog that no one will ever see. I have to really get out and try to make a difference. I have to team up with people who agree with me on these issues, I have to protest, whether through letter writing or through hitting the streets (although I live in a hick town, so it's not very likely that I'll be able to get to any protests until I have my driver's liscense). I have to spread information, get into debates with people, and practice writing this shit and talking about it so I don't seem like a complete moron. Because alone I don't make much of a difference, but, as those Anti-Flag dudes say, "The people, united, will never be defeated."    That's my ramble for today folks. If I'm feeling particularly angry later, maybe I'll write another.      Soundtrack- From Autumn to Ashes, Senses Fail, Poison the Well
