RIght after the end of school bell rang they were like "this is a real code red drill! everyone back inside their classrooms!"  so we sat on the floor in Tandon's room for like OVER AN HOUR.  It turned out some guy who stole a car ditched it by branham with a bag that had a sawed off shotgun and the police were persuing him around branham and they ended up capturing him in the branham parking lot.  Boy, a day with two code red drill, nothing can beat that but the pain in my bum from sitting on the hard floor for over an hour.  sigh.  what is this world coming to?
