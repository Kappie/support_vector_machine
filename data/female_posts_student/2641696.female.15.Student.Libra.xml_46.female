The chaos theory is basically that disorder can come from order, AND that order can come from disorder. Seemingly entirely random, too. This sudden appearance comes from tiny, tiny tinytinytiny differences in data: a difference of 0.00000000000000001 will, eventually, entirely change the outcome of the equation. Hence the Butterfly Effect: the flap of a butterfly's wing could, potentially, cause or prevent some massive hurricane elsewhere in the world. A near-invisible change in conditions will cause huge differences in later results.    Of course this means that no experiment, of course, is entirely controlled, and that experiment results can always, potentially, be entirely off. You can't control everything in a lab, no matter how hard you try. Everything has some sort of effect on the experiment. Which is bad. Because now we can never be sure if the results were because of some random background noise, or because the cold honestly killed off all the chickens.   Apparently this is called sensitive dependence on initial conditions.   And this takes us into all sorts of other things. If you happen to be absolutely fascinated with how one tiny thing can change the world, you can visit  urlLink Chaos Theory: A Brief Introduction  for tons more information. Or just type 'the chaos theory' into  urlLink Google . So anyways, that's it. Just thought I'd share it with everyone... ^^;   Seeing as I'm weird and all o_O
