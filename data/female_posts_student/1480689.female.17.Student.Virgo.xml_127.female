GPA- 3.857. and damn proud of it. maybe I'll be bumped back into the top 15% instead of.... 19 i think?? most people would be soooooo happy to be in that even, BUT FUCK THAT. f-u-c-k-t-h-a-t. I know i can get over a 4.0 and i fucking want to. this whole thing, school, isn't about learning, its about being the best so you can get into the best college and lead the best life. that's it. And i wand to be the best. i want to come out on top and shine. C's are not acceptable to me or my family. I got them last year, 4th quarter, I wanted to hurt myself. So my goal for 2nd quarter, is to get all A's, a 4.285 GPA. I WANT IT.
