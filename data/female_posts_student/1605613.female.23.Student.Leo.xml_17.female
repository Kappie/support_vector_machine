In 1985 and 1988, Hershiser had seasons a pitcher could only dream about.  In the years '87-'89 he was throwing more innings than any starter.  Hopefully this year he'll be able to save his arm a few times and turn it over to the bullpen which consists of Rod Beck, Todd Jones, Jim Gott, Greg McMichael, and Joe Borowski.  But is Orel going to put up another '88 season?  Supported by such hitters as Shawn Green, Dave Hansen, Mark Kotsay, Eric Karros, Scott Podsednik, David Dellucci, and Brad Fullmer, we'll just have to wait and see.
