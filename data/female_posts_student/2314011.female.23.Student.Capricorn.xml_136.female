You know, in a world in which Bush and Blair can be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, "for having dared to take the necessary decision to launch a war on Iraq without having the support of the UN" I find myself agreeing with Tom Lehrer: satire is dead.   And making sure we know about the  urlLink Bucket Full O' Kittens .  There's something for everyone!  WooHoo!
