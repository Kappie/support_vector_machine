So I think I might just randomly write whatever comes to mind...first of something I wrote while bored...I think it's amusing" In a world where strange produce can be made into bread..." Don't know where it's going but I was thinking about the zuccinin bread that was on the counter. And crap I think I'm getting sick again! My throught is sore and all of my muscles have been acing and I've just felt awful...so I'm either getting sick of I'm just tired and I burned my mouth on soup. Coause I know I've burned my tounge but didn't think I burned the rest of my mouth. Oh yes getting my hair cut soon...I am actually thinking of bangs...which I haven't had for 3 years...So i don't know but I think I'd look better with them so I might shoot myself later but oh well...yeah well that's all the stuff that i had thought of before I started writing! Yeah I actually plot all this stuff all out...who knew...and going back to the search for conversation topics...
