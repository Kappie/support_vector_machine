There is your quote: Je m'aperçus bientôt que l'amour ressemble à la soif : une goutte d'eau l'augmente. Scores: (names in descending order) Alison Michael Olivia Nathan Sarah and Jonah Evan Scores stand at what they were last time but Sarah has 160 more points. yay!  My grandfather is here. He got here around 10:30 am, meaning I was only half an hour off in my prediction. We went to lunch today and then drove and saw mom at work.  Well, I must go now. Sarah will be here soon to pick me up, so yeah. I'll tell you how that goes later.  OH! And HAPPY BIRTHDAY JANE!!!!!! JOYEUX ANNIVERSAIRE!!!! FELICAM NATALAM!!!!!!! 16!!!!!! wOOt!!!!!!  "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."
