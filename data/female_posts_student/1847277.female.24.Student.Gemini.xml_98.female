Bob wasn't around, so I couldn't actually get the Montenegro tickets yet, but I did get my tickets for Detroit-London, bracketing the beginning and the end of my massive trip.  Wheee, fun.  I'm flying into Heathrow because that seemed to be easiest.  We'll see how that works out.    Anyhoo, off to read more about the Philippines at Spanish Contact.
