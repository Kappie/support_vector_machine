THEY CANCELLED LOLLAPALOOZAAAA!!!! *Cries* I was going to go to that...  AHH! I'm leaving in a week!! ... (W00t)!!! And yes, the hair is getting cut Friday. If you wish to come by and see it/say goodbye/get together and do something, give me a call to make sure I'm home/for tentative advance planning as this week will be cra-zy, and it'd be lovely to see you.
