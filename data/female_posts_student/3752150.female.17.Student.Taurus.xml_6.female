I ate some extremely good food, went swimming, and won the sack race. For that I got this hot shirt that says " I won this at Riverside's sunday school picnic". The back is the same except it's a mirror image. After that Sarah dragged me along to Susan's grad party... how fun. We stayed for like 15 minutes.    On the way home I passed glen hill in my car and I was thinking... "Wow, I must look extremely hot driving in my hot station wagon with my hotgood will sunglasses, listening to my hot techno remix cd."
