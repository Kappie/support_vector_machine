He has an 80's perm and looked like my uncle Andy's brother.  I need to erase this from my memory.  This is truly insane- and he's won awards for this!  Hollywood is strange.  Really, truly strange .   I'm not going to Florida. It turns out Diane got the week off to watch Miranda so sadly, I will not be running away to Destin for the week.  I wish I could . I want to go far, far away. Plus I am dying to go and jump into a pool. Even if I'm in all my clothes. Jmac did it at Mishi's! Man that was funny.   Miles and I are terrified of senior year. Truly terrified.  Someone come help us.    I think I am going to go and check my mailbox for my AP scores. I really want them.  Now . Miles, Sallis, and I have yet to get ours. If I get mine, I will go dance in the streets. Even if they are bad.   Perhaps I'll just go take that flight anyway. Meh.
