I don't really have a reason why, I guess its just that I haven't really had anything of any real substance to write.  How many times can you guys really sit here and stomach reading all the inconsequential details of my weekend especially if you weren't a part of it?  I dunno, I personally like to hear the details of people's lives, but that's just because I'm nosy and this whole blog thing makes it easier for me to be all up in their business without actually having to pry or speak to them.    What could I tell you guys that you'd possibly care about?  Hmmm...I saw  urlLink Bobby Bonilla  at Dunkin' Donuts this morning.  Just getting his coffee and donuts like everyone else now that he's back in town after the end of the season.  There is a job working for a production company of a  urlLink big name director  that lives locally that is available, but is it worth a 10k paycut initially?  I'm not sure about that.  I also applied for a job at the  urlLink WWE  as an administrative assistant.  That would be cool if it panned out, but I'm not about to go getting my hopes up.  I mean I'm happy with the people I work with (well with one  urlLink glaring exception ) but I've had a lot of responsibility added to my job duties and I think that warrants a bit more than what I'm making now.  At least put me on the same level as my friend who was hired after and basically does the same thing.  I can't wait for November.  October has been a blast, but its just been I N S A N E L Y busy.   urlLink The boy  and I have not stopped running around the entire month!  We had our trip to Montreal,  the Dave Attell/Lewis Black/Mitch Hedberg show with  urlLink The Fuzzy One  and  urlLink Whitey's Man Bitch , the Crankcase show at the Hard Rock, Six Flags trip, tonite we have a  urlLink Maroon Five  show to go to at Roseland and Friday we have a wedding.  I think both of us really just need a rest.  I dunno about him but I plan to spend all my November weekends snuggled in under the covers with a home cooked meal and a bottle of wine watching all the movies I've never seen (trust me, its a H U G E list).  I think the only time he and I will probably go out is to go see Matrix Revolutions 'cause he's a bigtime Matrix fanboy.  I really miss my bebe,  urlLink Lisa  (Effmeboobs in the pic), she's the bestest and I know she's hella busy with her new job, but if she sees this: call me.  We need coffee or a massage or facial or something girly.  I love ya so much, girlie!  I'm getting excited for the  urlLink Bozzies .  They're only five days away.  I hear the after party is gonna be a good one so make sure you get on the list, pronto.  I'll catch ya on the flipside kiddies, behave!
