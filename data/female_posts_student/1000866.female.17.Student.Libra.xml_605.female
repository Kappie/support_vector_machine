I might actually go do it now or something just to have it done with. Then today, I have a doctor's appointment then work. Blah. I get off at 8:00 though so I'm hoping maybe I can do something after then. I'm determined to do something with like..every single one of my friends over break which means the people who are leaving on vacation next week, I have to do stuff with this weekend. I think only Kels and Peter are going away, so thankfully that's only two people.   Unfortunately though, I have a bit of a cold. It's not too bad though so I should be fine by the end of the weekend and it's not going to stop me from enjoying my spring break. :)  Anyway, I'm going to go do that homework and just have it done with. Maybe I'll write more later since I have a lot of time now! :)
