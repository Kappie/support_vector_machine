There are tons of cool new ones - only snag you have to imput again all the adjustments you made - like links and stuff. Fortunately I copied my original formula so I could refer back to it - cunning hey!  Haven't got the comments bit back in yet, but promise will do so asap. Does anyone know how you do it so that it carries on from the comments book from before??????
