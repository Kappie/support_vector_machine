After a long long rest just after loving and breaking someone, NOW LOOK AT ME! STANDING TALL! lolz  I can say it's no fun for me... TEARS, FAKE LAUGHTERS, MAKING YERSELF BUSY... nahhh I'm over it. KAKASAWA.  But honestly, it really WORKS! Syempre gagawin mo lahat un para makalimutan un... AASAHAN MO PA BA?  Kung babalik pa siya, hell, layas-layas na siya sa harap ko DAHIL DI KO NA SIYA KAILANGAN... fuck..parang kanta e.  Neway, I just realized that getting off that DAMN love... was like, entering FREEDOM. Really.  Pero anu ba yan, another passes by and says, "HI, I LIKE YOU. CAN YOU BE MINE?" Sure, but this time... di muna seryoso. Heh.  E anung magagawa ko? I just want to be happy. Contented na feeling mo free ka pa ren. Kahit na meron ka na namang BOYFRIEND. Sus.  Mabuting single muna but not forever.  I NOW DECLARE A NEW DAY REBORNS FOR ME. :)
