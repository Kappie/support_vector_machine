When watching Ruud Van Nistelrooy No matter what your aim, With eyes like that, one finds it hard To consentrate on the game! My heart is filled with love for Ruud And locker littered with pics, And try as i might not to think about him It's a habit I just can't kick (no pun intended) So who needs David Beckham? Cole, Owen or Henry? As gorg' as they are, and well as they play, Van Nistelrooy's for me!"   urlLink www.ruudvannistelrooy.com/   Ruud van Nistelrooy is one person who can really make me go weak on my knees. He represents utter perfection for me in every sense.     urlLink www.rvn10.com  !
