I do not think that anyone should be allowed to have children until they are financially able to take care of them.      I think that instead of delivering food to the starving people over seas that keep reproducing kids that they can't feed that we should have and should place them on some type of birth control.      Whether or not these take away certain rights I think that they would better our world.
