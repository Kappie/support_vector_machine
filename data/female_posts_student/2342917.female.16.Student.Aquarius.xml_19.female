The first lot I tried on were 16 and they just did not fit so she said to try 14’s- these fitted better but still they didn’t fit enough to compliment, so she said to try a 12- at first I was gona say no cos I thought no way in hell. Ive got no chance, but I thought well might as well give it a try- what hav I got 2 loose. So I tried on this dress and well…what can I say…fitted like a dream :D cld not belive it- I tried on others and they fitted and looked brill- but I felt more comfortable in the one I have got- the price was good as well only £70 to hire and £6 for this necklace- it is like a burgundy red but I cant really describe it- will have 2 be a surprise-lol- there was a serious over load of compliments though- in a nice way though- not in a “im tryin 2 selll u this dress way” in a nice way- shes makes u feel like u can wear anything – yes I know that sounds sooo bloody cheesy- ah still can not believe what size it is though (by the way I went to cinderellas in felpham, have cards if u want 1-lol is really good :D )  Anywayz just kinda telling u about that…u probably got bored when I startyed saying about the prom dress –like the first few lines so im sorry 4 that-lol Drama play is going really well at the mo- has come a long way and we have only just started- got some decent cds as well- muse is mind blowing- purely beautiful-I love the piano- and system of a down- their rare tracks is very very good- download metro- and that is an order if u haven’t heard it- go on- got to ur download thing- tupe in system of a down yes that’s it- and type in metro- and wala!- anywayz im off 2 finish some drama c/w and talk on msn- keeps mooing at me (that’s what it does when some one sayd something) is very weird with system of a down in your ears with the mooing !-lo anywayz hope u r ok if u read this…who ever that may b-lol cya
