First of all, the opening act was Drew O'Doherty (or was it O'Donnelly?). And I was surprised at how good he was. At first I was like 'ohh god another sensitive dude w/a guitar', but he actually had a really nice, kind of dark/shoegazer minor-key sound with nuanced lyrics that seemed to be grappling with loss, mourning and memory. And he was really warm and conversational with the crowd, which always makes an act, esp with singer-songwriters.   I used to be a big opening-act freak: I had to get there early, wanting to hear a new band, hoping that someday I could say 'Oh yeah,,, band XYZ, I saw them  before they were big , opening for so-and-so'... but I gave that up as I've grown older and realized that most opening acts- except when the bands tour together, it seems- kind of suck. Also I don't have the stamina to stand for another whole hour, listen to people standing around me get progressively drunker. The only purposes of the opening act (again, except when the bands are touring together) it seems to me, are:  1. to make you think you got more for your buck.  2. to give people time to get wasted so they'll be less inhibited when the headliner gets on.  3. to give the die hard fans time to push and shove their way to a satisfactory spot for the headlining act. Which gets easier the drunker people get, except for the ones that get more belligerent.  So I came early mostly for reason #3, and was well-pleased. As soon as the opening act finished, I slinked my way right up front and managed to get  next  to the tall blonde who I was afraid I'd be stuck  behind . Being 5'3", I always wish they would instate a rule that forces tall people (5'10" or over) to let short people (5'3" or under) stand directly in front of them. It just ain't right.  So Drew finished and, being that it would just be Hayden and his guitar, there was very little set-up time between acts, which again, always brings me joy not to have to stand around and listen to the house music and watch people get still-more drunk. Because by that time I've chosen my spot for the performance, and every minute waiting is another minute I might have to go to the bathroom and risk losing my spot, or another minute where a belligerent tall person might try to push into my space.   ANYWAY Hayden, in person, seems much warmer and more well-adjusted than one might expect just by listening to his music, which has a very distinct melancholy about it. On the stage, he is actually quite funny, sharing off-color anecdotes and memories of things that just pop into his head over the course of the show. He is by turns charming, flirtatious, sincere,  honest .   He has many story songs which involve the death, or implied death, of his protagonists. On the albums they come off as sort of 'man, can this guy see the bright side of  anything ???'-- in person, they seem more in the spirit or tradition of the murder ballad. You can see him kind of smirking as he sings some of the more tragic, slightly impossible lyrics, for example he has a song about an old love being eaten by a bear. At one point in the song, his delivery led the crowd to laugh out loud, and he said sarcastically  'it's not funny' .  He interacts with the crowd easily, and by the end of the show I felt like he had befriended us all as a unit. There were many moments where our behavior clearly affected his performance- in an encore cover of Otis Redding's "Sitting on the Dock of the Bay", he was unable to finish the whistling part as the crowd was distracting him by trying to whistle along as well; he ended up just laughing and trying to keep his composure. In another song, he seemed to honestly be soliciting our advice about his choice to perform a trumpet solo with his mouth since he can't afford to bring a trumpeter on tour with him. Again, he laughed when he tried to perform it, mostly because we were laughing, too, and throughout the performance there was this real conversation that seemed to be going on between him and Us. This is sadly a rare treat; at so many concerts we are lucky if we get a 'thank you boston'.  And did I mention he really ROCKS, and it was surprising how much intensity and rhythm he was able to create without the aid of a drummer or rhythm section. He was totally captivating and I found myself almost dancing at times, and slightly dizzy watching the intricacy of his strumming technique, trying to learn how he managed that kind of sound all by himself.  In the very last song he performed he gave us the opportunity to sing along, and I was surprised and heartened to hear how many people in the crowd knew every lyric to the song. During the chorus, a sort of 'la la la' variation, he stopped singing completely and let the crowd carry the show. He was so pleased that he had us repeat it a few times ('that was so good, do it again!'), and it felt like such a perfect ending, a way to give back to him some of the joy and energy that he had shared with us. Every 'la' I sung was more of a monosyllabic thankyouthankyouthankyou for the opportunity to actually have a fun, meaningful night.   It's strange, his music has always been like 'music-to-get-sad-to', but in person it all seems to even out. I became able to see how someone can embody a full range of emotions all at once, that being 'sad' isn't this one dimensional thing, that you can be sad and funny at the same time, that you can embody joy in one moment and in the very next moment be able to touch deeply the universality of human suffering. In fact, knowing that we all share this common struggle makes life easier, and creates the context of HOPE, which Hayden expresses much more of live than on his albums.   Amber stage lights reflected off of his polished guitar.  It smelled a sweet musk of vetiver and beer.
