Oh, your gaze is dangerous  And you fill your space so sweet  If I let you get too close  You'll set your spell on me  So darlin' I just wanna say  Just in case I don't come through  I was on to every play I just wanted you   But, oh, it's so evil, my love, the way you've no reverence to my concern  So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love,  to save the pain of  Once my flame and twice my burn  -Fiona Apple, "Shadowboxer"
