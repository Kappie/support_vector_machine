Whenever they had problems, whether it was about school, or family, or their love lives, they’d come to either one of us for advice.  This is my, I can’t remember anymore, nth family.  I had kids in UST, from the UST College Journal, the JCBA Debate Society and the JCBA Chorale; I had kids in San Beda, both from the straight and the gay communities; I have kids in UE.  I think the biggest population of people where I have “kids” can be found in UE.  Everybody calls me “mama” or “nanay” in UE, even people who are slightly older than I am.  I don’t exactly mind, except that, after the breakup, everybody was all upset.  Not that they had to take sides from either one of us, it was just different.  We were together for three years and everybody, and I mean, EVERYBODY couldn’t get used to the fact that we weren’t together anymore.  Mark, from the original batch of Lex Palooza, said we were icons.  Icons?  In Constitutional Law, we fall under the term “public figures”. Really?  Some people were genuinely upset when they found out my girlfriend and I broke up, the “kids” were very much affected.  Others were just waiting for it to happen.  You know how straight people think.  They like you individually or together but they don’t necessarily expect your relationship to last that long.  You know, so they could spit out,   “I thought so,”  I think there wasn’t any real big relationship to watch aside from ours so you could consider us as a source of entertainment in the college of law.  Nothing really big was happening if there weren’t any gigs and the students were tired of studying so they make it their business to meddle with other people’s affairs.   I’m still “mom” to some people.  Well, as far as the kids from UST and SBC are concerned, I’m still their mom. ‘Coz when I assumed mother status, I was just mom and dad could be whoever I was dating at the time so if the relationship didn’t work, they didn’t really need to adjust much.  I was like their friend who was sooo in touch with her maternal instincts.  They like it that way.  I’m big sister, mother, friend ‘coz they couldn’t exactly share everything with their real mothers.  I’d let them smoke and drink for as long as they could take care of themselves.  I just pamper them like a mother would without necessarily giving them allowance, just little things that make you more lovable as a friend but short of a mom already.  And it was sooo okay for me to date a younger guy ‘coz if it didn’t work out, I could just refer him to one of my “daughters”.  They never really mind when I give advice, whether if it’s about business or family or sex or love because they know that I know what I’m talking about.   Especially when I talk about sex.   I usually start with the phrase, “okay, take this educationally,” and a discussion about boys and girls and gays and lesbians and the birds and the bees follows.  It’s all good.  I wouldn’t really start talking if I didn’t know they were mature enough to absorb everything that I said and I censor myself.  I don’t really yak when there are people who are below the age of 18 around.  I don’t assume to be responsible although I try to be, to set a good example.  After all, I’m their “mom”.  I don’t meddle with their decisions although they give weight to my opinions, especially about their love life.  Been there, done that.  Well, almost done everything.    I’m not God. I’m not perfect. I’m just “Ate Bels” or “Nanay Bels”.  I can’t always assume that when I say something they’ll do exactly what I said or that I’m always right.  I can’t always be right.  I just let them know that when they need me, I’m there and if I can’t always help, that I’d at least listen and try to understand what they’re  going through.  Everybody needs a sounding board, a hug, a smile, a hand, anything that might give them hope.  Because I’m not God and I don’t try to be God.  But if I can tell a person that there is a God and that prayer helps when all hope is left (I’m beginning to preach and I don’t even mean to.  Religion and morality is relative.) Then my work is done.  I mean, when I’m lonely or despondent, I’d want someone to talk to me and listen to me whine and hug me and tell me everything’s gonna be okay so why can’t I do that when somebody else needs it?  I think this all started when my own mother died.  Not that I blame her for leaving but I kinda felt the need to share what I had when she was still alive to people who take their moms for granted.  Or it could be my frustration to have a kid of my own (because I always thought I’d have kids but no dad and I thought this way even before I was going out with a lesbian) that I have this insane urge to take care of everybody else.  That or the thought that if you were nice to people bad enough, they’d be nice to you too. I don’t know.  I honestly don’t know.    Right now, I just want to enjoy being “Bels”, whether it’s “ate” or “mommy”, I don’t really care.  I’m just enjoying my life.  I just keep telling everyone to get used to the idea that “nanay” and “tatay” aren’t together anymore, that we may never get back together, and if “tatay” gets a stepmom, to just be nice to stepmom.  I mean, I’m still their friend and as their friend, I’m entitled to find my happiness.  If I bring someone who could be potential stepdad or stepbutch, I’d want them to be nice to him/her too, right?  I want them to be happy and I want me to be happy too.  I’ve always been “mom” to people even before I met this girl and I’ll always be “sorta mom” to people even after she left my life.  It’s like how your friend will always be your friend before, during and after his stupid boyfriend dumps her.   so i am :) urlLink
