Sam dared Philip to eat 3 green chili padis which he found in his maggi mee goreng. If Philip ate: One chili, Sam would belanja him a normal lunch Two chilies, Sam would belanja him buffet at Sunway Lagoon All three chilies, Sam would belanja him buffet at a KL hotel. Too bad tho, in the end the chilies weren’t hot hot hot.  I used to use scissors to cut of the rear end of flying ants. Sam used to experiment pressing fresh lizard poop and also watching lizards tails hopping about. Stephen used to eat cockroach eggs.  I enjoy talking about what I did when I was young. I am extremely proud of my childhood. Though still a city kid, I had more adventures than most.    The Suria House  We stayed in the Taman Suria house when I was 3 to 7 years old, it was small tiny terrace house. (you could see to the back once you stepped in) In front of our house, we had this huge, huge patch of tall lalang, it ran all along the side of a monsoon drain. My brother and I, we would often roam this tall patch of grass, looking for snakes, lizards, stray cats and nice birds. We even spotted a hornbill on the other side of the drain once! I remembered we would find a spot where we could walk to into the monsoon drain (there wasn’t much water, it was walkable) and look for slimy disgusting stuff that any boisterous 12 year old boy and 5 year old tomboyish girl would love. I still remember once, we found an eel in the drain and we took it back home. Oh, mind you, this monsoon drain we’re talking about is huge. 10 feet deep, perhaps? Or not, since it might have seemed bigger since I was smaller. During the very dry season, the huge patch of lalang would always catch fire, and the fire engine would come in the mid of the night and selamba-ly put it out. Then the next morning, my brother and I (you will be seeing this phrase a lot here) would go out and look for roasted carcasses. Heh heh. Chun la. Cat skeleton. Come on, which of you can boast that you’ve found a cat skeleton when you were 5? =) I guess all these experiences have made deep impacts on my life and what I want to do later on. Wednesday was pasar malam day in our area. Most of the stalls were Malay and my bro and me would go around making friends with the stall owners. Hehe. There was this stall which fried chicken, fried cow lungs and our favourite fried chicken backside! They sold them for like 10 for a buck. It was super worth-it. My bro and I would split 20 between us and then we would take the bag to the padang behind our house and sit at the lil atap hut and eat our chicken backsides. Then we’d get rid of the plastic bag and walk innocently home. I don’t know why we hid it but we did. It sounds so funny now though. Oh, don’t worry, we confessed to our parents a few years ago. Hahaha.
