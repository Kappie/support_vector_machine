In fact, a song.  But there's only the lyrics.  Which is okay, seeing as I didn't bother actually thinking up a tune.  But you don't need to know that.  So here we go:  Oh, sometimes she's rather crazy. And sometimes she's rather glum. But I can say for certain That she's not very dumb. For VW, though she's crazy, Is wise beyond her years. She'll share with you the good times But also calm your fears. So bow to her!  I dare you to! You will not regret, For VW, she's an awesome dude, One you won't forget.  Ahh, dripping with cheezy goodness.  And by the way, VW must be pronounced Vuh-Wuh for the meter to work out correctly.  I s'pose now Elm will desire a song, eh?
