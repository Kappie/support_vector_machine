Dave's out of town in Arizona job interviewing and whenever he's gone I don't sleep well at all.  Every little creak I think someone is breaking into the apartment to get me.  Last time he was in Ohio interviewing I slept with the 8 iron by the bed.  There's something really wrong with me.  I had all day to accomplish so much and all I did was get some free software off the internet and create this blog.  Oh well, there is always tomorrow.
