The characters looked so real !  It more like a movie-movie, instead of an animated film. The story was okay. Not really all that spectacular, but the spectacular job they did on the animation made up for it (to me, anyhow).    We (Dave, Donna, Brian and I) attended Logan's birthday party at my parents house last night. There were a lot of guests. Logan came away with so much stuff !  He is going to be one spoiled little boy. I can already see it !  The rocking horse was a big hit !  Logan loved it !  I was really pleased about that.    Mom is having a second party for those who were unable to attend Friday night on Sunday. That's how it is here in Wichita. The members of the Filipino community are so sensitive. You have to make everyone happy. No one must feel left out. Otherwise, you're done for !
