If the evening following each exam is going to keep getting better and better, next week's going to be Out of Control, I tell ya what!  So the Torts exam rocked the cock.  Or rather, I rocked the Tort exam's cock.  Oh yea, don't even try that prima facie case shit on me, sister!  I'll mop the floor with your prima facie case!!    Went to the Alehouse with some comrades afterward and had some dinner, beer, good laughs and inappropriate touching.  Can't get any better than that!  Yoga was sooo our friend tonight.  Instructors in little, loose-fitting cotton tank tops are always our friends.  Plus, the standing-pose practice was great for harnessing all that powerful energy and putting it to good use.  Beer and burger kinda sloshed around, but I was in such a great place that I didn't even really notice.  Yay!  Drove all the way home and only then do I remember I'm out of coffee.  But that just means more time in Harley with the great, uplifting, GRRR music playing and we can always use more of that.  Got the November Mix in the player now and we're going great on Track 4 and not a icky clicky noise to be heard...Rock.On!  Okay, got Jack  Karen hour coming up here pretty quick, so I best be off.  Might just be back in half an hour, though, I dunno!
