I finally totaled points. If you want to know, just ask! I'd rather not post them in here right now. Maybe later though.   Yeah, so I'm not feeling too well. Up until today, I haven't been really nervous about this weekend, but it's hitting me now. I'll get over it after everything is over though. I'm just a bit nervous.   With all that said, not much more has happened here. It's been really quiet, which I guess is good. Chelsea's having her birthday party Friday night, but that isn't going to really be a problem, considering only 1 girl is coming. Besides, I'm going to a movie that night with my dad.  (Hence why I am nervous) Ah well. Again, I'll get over it. I'm sure I'll be okay.   Otherwise, that's about all.   "Shall we go to bed?"
