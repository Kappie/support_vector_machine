We had a four day weekend last weekend, because finals were over... i can't really remember what i did.... oh right i slept over at charlotte's, we had a great time having a disgustingly girly night... we ate chinese and watched pretty woman, working girl, you've got mail... haha almost cliche...  that was great. Uh don't remember what I did Sunday... I think me and josh did something... but what... anyway on tuesday we didn't have school so me and josh went to Liberty to see his luver or should i say who he wishes was his lover... but yeah i thought we'd get lost so we left at 9:30 after tenni shoe registration but we didn't get lost... so we were there way before lunch so we spent an hour or so wandering the halls and being the crazy mutha fuckers we are... so I finally met Danny, he's a cool kiddo! We met a lot of cool kids... it was really weird because we ran into a guy i know from Camp Burton (also named danny) who had a crush on me... meh anyway. Josh tells me that Danny said that everyone was like "who were those crazy kids?" haha that was a fun day.  I started like all new classes this week, because i'm finally out of Altman's class which i'm conflicted about... because while i know i'd fail that class another semester i also know that i'm at a much higher level than the class i'm in now. Oh well grades are the most important. I have Journalism now and it's fun, it's like a team or a club more than a class, and Mrs Dietz is really really awesome. Anyways I'm tired now... i just came back from hanging out with charlotte and it's 11 and i need new contacts and i had to get up at 5 this morning for link crew. so to sum things up i'm tired.
