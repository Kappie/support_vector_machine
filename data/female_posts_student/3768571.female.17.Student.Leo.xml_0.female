I don't like politics, I don't like the way the country is run, I don't like the National Curriculum, I don't like reality television, I don't like children, I don't like adults, you can probably see where I'm going with this: I dislike a lot.   But all of that people can handle. They say "yeah... I see your point."   However, there's one thing that sends people into fits of disbelief, their minds are shunned into dubious incredulity, they take on a defensive stance and tell me I'm clinically wrong in the head. What do I say to get this reaction? "I hate Harry Potter"  THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS!!! I can't stand the little horror.  I was having a discussion with my friends in the 6th Form common room and they were telling me how the books are brilliant, and the characters are great, the storyline is wonderful etc. Then someone told me that I obviously hadn't read the books. Well excuse me, but how could I possibly have formed an opinion if I hadn't *tried* to read the godforsaken thing?! Sheesh.   I tried to read the books and got to about the second chapter and the thought washed over me like a calm little wave on a Caribbean beach; 'my 12 year old brother could have written this'. I didn't like J.K's style at all. To me, it is childish and quite frankly, boring. That's right! I said HARRY POTTER was BORING. HA!   And then the films came out. Loooovely. I'm an avid movie watcher, I do enjoy films. I like the artistic value behind them as well as the storyline. And I can honestly say, I have not yet sat down in order to watch one of the Happy Rotter movies. My brother has acquired copies from his little friends and I can say I have seen parts of them here and there (the movies, not his friends, that is) and I wasn't very impressed. What I like most are the parts played by Robbie Coltrane and John Cleese. What I don't like are the overacted child parts. I'm sure Daniel, Emma and Rupert are lovely people, but the films just aren't my thing.  Although I suppose the thing I dislike most about it is the titanic hype around it. When a new HP book is released people seem to want to queue overnight to buy their copy at some ridiculously early hour of the morning. People claim "these are the best books I've ever read!" "Harry Potter's awesome!" What I want to know is, would they have the same reaction if the hype wasn't so big? Would they still love it so much if there wasn't so much merchandise around it? Would they still think it was one of the best things ever written? I doubt it.  I'm not saying I hate Harry lovers, because that's not true. If it were true then I wouldn't have any friends, but I am proud to say I am not a Harry lover. I just love to hate him.  You know the old saying; 'don't knock it until you've tried it'. Well, as far as Harry Potter is concerned, I have tried it. And now I'm knocking it.
