This  is  a really good game. Alto they just got a TD on their first possession...that doesn't bode very well. The Minnesota game is really awesome too, at least the clip they're showing is awesome. It's just a really good game day, I s'pose.  I have a endoscopy test on Thursday, they're giving me lots of nearly illegal drugs to make sure I don't feel them ramming a big metal tube down into my guts. And if they say "Too much Coke" I'm going to blow myself away.  With a gun!  Well, not really. 1. For Abby, 2. I've been doing alright without it thus far.
