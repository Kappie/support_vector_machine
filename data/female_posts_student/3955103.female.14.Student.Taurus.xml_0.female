I was at Candace's last night. First time in like forever! Haha but anyway, we went out to the Oaks for some midnight swim, but it got rained out. We went to Chili's and ate instead then went to blockbuster to get some movies. We got "You Got Served" and "The Perfect Score" since those are the only 2 movies her mom would let us get. Haha, yeah, sucks! But anyway I might be going to Christy's later tonight.. HAHAHAHA! JJ is scared shitless of her, it's so funny..    Candace told Pat today that he used to much tounge, it pissed me off! But that is like all that I have to say now.. so I'll chat ya up later!
