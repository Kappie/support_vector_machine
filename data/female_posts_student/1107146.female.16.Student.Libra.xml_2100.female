The piece  suggests two things    1) Americans and Canadians are not the only ones who get poor service from  their ISP, cable and/or alarm companies. (NTL is a cable operator in  Britain).    2) The Brits probably write the world's best letters of complaint.    ====================================    Dear Cretins    I have been an NTL customer since 9th July 2001, when I signed up for your  four-in-one deal for cable TV, cable modem, telephone, and alarm  monitoring.    During this three-month period I have encountered inadequacy of service  which I had not previously considered possible, as well as ignorance and  stupidity of monolithic proportions. Please allow me to provide specific  details, so that you can either pursue your professional prerogative and  seek to rectify these difficulties -- or more likely (I suspect) so that  you can have some entertaining reading material as you while away the  working day smoking B and drinking vendor-coffee on the bog in your  office.    My initial installation was cancelled without warning, resulting in my  spending an entire Saturday sitting on my fat arse waiting for your  technician to arrive. When he did not arrive, I spent a further 57 minutes  listening to your infuriating hold music, and the even more annoying  Scottish robot woman telling me to look at your helpful website. HOW?    I alleviated the boredom by playing with my testicles for a few minutes --  an activity at which YOU are no doubt both familiar and highly adept. The  rescheduled installation then took place some two weeks later, although  the technician did forget to bring a number of vital tools -- such as a  drill-bit and his cerebrum. Two weeks later, my cable modem had still not  arrived. After 15 telephone calls over four weeks my modem arrived, six  weeks after I had requested it -- and begun to pay for it. I estimate your  internet server's downtime is roughly 35% -- the hours between about 6 pm  and midnight, Monday through Friday and most of the weekend. I am still  waiting for my telephone connection.    I have made nine calls on my mobile to your no-help line and have been  unhelpfully transferred to a variety of disinterested individuals who are,  it seems, also highly skilled bollock jugglers. I have been informed that  a telephone line is available (and someone will call me back); that I will  be transferred to someone who knows whether or not a telephone line is  available (and then been cut off); that I will be transferred to someone  (and then been redirected to an answering machine informing me that your  office is closed); that I will be transferred to someone and then been  redirected to the irritating Scottish robot woman. And several other  variations on this theme.    Doubtless you are no longer reading this letter, as you have at least a  thousand other dissatisfied customers to ignore and also another one of  those crucially important testicle moments to attend to. Frankly I don't  care. It's far more satisfying as a customer to voice my frustrations in  print than to shout them at your unending hold music. Forgive me,  therefore, if I continue.    I thought British Telecom was crap; that they had attained the holy  piss-pot of god-awful customer relations; and that no one, anywhere, ever,  could be more disinterested, less helpful or more obstructive to  delivering service to their customers. That's why I chose NT and because,  well, there isn't anyone else is there?    How surprised I therefore was when I discovered to my considerable  dissatisfaction and disappointment what a useless shower of bastards you  truly are. You are sputum-filled pieces of distended rectum, incompetents  of the highest order. BT -- wankers though they are -- shine like  brilliant beacons of success in the filthy mire of your seemingly  limitless inadequacy.    Suffice to say that I have now given up on my futile and foolhardy quest  to receive any kind of service from you. I suggest that you cease any  potential future attempts to extort payment from me for the services which  you have so pointedly and catastrophically failed to deliver. Any such  activity will be greeted initially with hilarity and disbelief and will  quickly be replaced by derision and even perhaps bemused rage.    I enclose two small deposits, selected with great care from my cat's  litter tray, as an _expression of my utter and complete contempt for both  you and your pointless company. I sincerely hope that they have not become  desiccated during transit -- they were satisfyingly moist at the time of  posting, and I would feel considerable disappointment if you did not  experience both their rich aroma and delicate texture. Consider them the  very embodiment of my feelings towards NTL and its worthless employees.    Have a nice day. May it be the last in your miserable short lives, you  irritatingly incompetent and infuriatingly unhelpful bunch of twits.              May you rot in Hell, Robert Stokes
