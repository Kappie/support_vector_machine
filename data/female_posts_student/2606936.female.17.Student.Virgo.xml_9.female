They phrase themselves like music, so when someone reads German poetry well, it sounds like a chant. Each syllable, each word, is separated by the breath so that it's all articulated clearly, but there is always resolution. If you know what a periodic sentence is in English, that's the closest thing i can think of to compare it to. But german - !  The inflections of the voice, of questions, anger, uncertainty, sarcasm, all feel so much more natural in german. The sentence always ends, either resolving the entire piece, with a soft, low tone and a crisp cut-off - "Das habe ich noch nie bevor gemacht." or with a question! - the beauty of a German question, carrying the melody to the next speaker, growing in intensity, volume, inflection, ready for the next entrance. "Was denkst du?"  It feels like a crime to interrupt someone because it disrupts the pattern. if you don't allow them to finish their ideas, it takes away from the song quality, because there's no verb, no action, no movement. "Das ist die Maedchen, die ich sehr gut bevor-" man kann da nicht nur - wait - crap - sorry. You can't just stop there, you have to hear the rest, you have to know what happened, to feel the emotion behind the words.  When you speak long sentences, it sounds like a Romantic melody, one long, clear, stream of breath, interrupted only by the tongue. I love to speak in it, just to hear my own thick, loud, obnoxious voice transformed into music.   It seems so much more natural. So many words sound like English, use the roots we know so well, but the way they feel in your mouth are so much easier. "The" vs. "die;" "tanz" vs. "dance"; "that" vs. "das/s" - if you know German, just take a moment and speak. Don't read, don't recite - speak the language, feel it, let it roll off your tongue in swells, and you will feel the resolution. You can feel the connection with other speakers, why any language is so important.   With German, i marvel at human creation, that people were able to develop something so aesthetically pleasing, using only their own minds, their own voices, their own need to communicate and touch others. It;s like, they only needed a way to comunicate, but they gave it these patterns that are just so perfect and so beautiful, and it's entirely human. I feel like if i had been born speaking it, my poetry would flow so much better. German is always crowding the back of your throat, begging to be brought into the world for the joy and enlightenment of other people. it's like when you hear music that gives you chills on your neck, and you try to recreate it with your own poor voice, and the attempt brings tears to your eyes. The emotion, the beauty, the joy and pain, the sheer humanity behind language, is what i love about it. Music creates a mood, creates feelings that are shared by listeners. A beautiful language can both create the mood and communicate concrete ideas.   That's why literature is so amazing. The awesome thing about good song lyrics is that it's poetry - the form of language closest to the human spirit - but it has that untouchable, unreachable music behind it.  this is what makes me happy, truly - knowing that it's possible for a human soul to make something so beautiful, because if someone else can do it, so can i. i want to create beauty, or at least perpetuate it, honor it, reveal it to those who are too afraid to look in familiar places.
