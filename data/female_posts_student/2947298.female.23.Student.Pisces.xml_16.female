Going to the  urlLink Met  to take care of two projects and then driving to stay w/ my Uncle and his wife in  urlLink D.C.,  while there we will be seeing the sights,  urlLink Marching for Womans Rights  and then seeing my Aunt I haven't seen in over a year.  Will be back monday so if you don't see me online or doing this till then...I'm there... Wish me luck! It's not like world trade organization or anything.... we are just a bunch of helpless females!
