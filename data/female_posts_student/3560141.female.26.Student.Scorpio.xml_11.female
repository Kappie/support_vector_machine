He told me how he spent the more amusing portion of his day convincing a set of residents that it truly was a fake, that the craftsmenship was of superb quality, but it was definitely a fake.  He knows because he was accosted his second day in NYC by three young men and the only thing they took when mugging him was his fake Omega watch.  They punched him in the eye, but took a twenty dollar watch.  My partner relived her experience in Dominica, the ease of a Caribbean breeze, the solitary street light that shone above their apartment complex, and a truck load of locals with machetes who appeared as if they were pirates.  She moved three weeks later, but her other two complex resident buddies remained on their patios always armed with machetes with longer blades and a single door to an apartment with a phone always propped open, set up specifically for the getaway.  I have gotten items of value stolen from me, but I've never been shaken to the core before.  That core, the place that houses respect and hope in fellow man.  If I ever came face to face with an addict who had transcended every ounce of civilized living just to get another fix, or a hungry person who would eat my core alive in order to survive I believe I would curl into a ball and surrender to the idea of faithlessness....Just a thought that invoked serious fear and gratitude
