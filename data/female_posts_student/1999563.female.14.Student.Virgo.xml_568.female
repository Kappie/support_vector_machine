     
           Its in my pocket.  I printed it all out.  It burns through the cloth.  I know I shouldn't dwell on what you said  How you hated me.  But I can't just stop thinking about it.  It makes me want to cry.  Why don't you like me?  You said I thought I was perfect  I don't think that  I never have.  Please listen.  I may not trust you.  But we were such good friends  What happened?   I shall never know.  But I know I still love you.  No matter what.   I will never hate you.
