THE HAPPY POEM    Empty hopes and spoiled dreams, that’s what life is made of.              You can wish and you can want           But in the end you’ll just give up.              You can love and you can care               but in the end, no one’s there.              Why do I yearn , why do I pray       When I know I’ll have nothing at the end of the day        You can say life has it’s ups and it’s downs          But in the end, you’ll still wear a frown.              So now I sit here and I cry,         hoping that all the pain will soon run dry        Hoping that maybe someone will come to save me          Knowing that you’re the only thing I need          So stupidly I start to hope and to pray       Wanting the strength to make it through another day     Then I snap back to reality, to the cold hard truth.               I’m alone, what’s the use?
