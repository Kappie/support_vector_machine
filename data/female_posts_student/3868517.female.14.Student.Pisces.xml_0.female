Also, we weren't the youngest and smallest in Forte Clarke so while the 8th graders were picking on us, we would pick on the 6th graders...and boy did that feel great! My teachers were a bit different than my 6th grade ones and the material we learned was a lot harder.....go figure. Well, I also made a lot of new friends like Brittany Filer, who became one of my new best friends. I still kept in touch with my 5th grade best friend, Courtney Jones and even though Brittany didn't like Courtney that much, we still did things together and went places. During 7th grade, a lot of things changed with myself. First, I didn't really care about my grades as much as I cared about how I presented myself and how I looked. My whole attitude changed and I started getting "boy crazy" just like Brittany. You know they always say that once you start hanging around with people too long, you start doing and acting like that person. That's sort of what happened. During the end of the 7th grade year, I felt an attraction between a certain someone and myself...and to all of you who know me, which is probably only the people who read this, you probably know who I'm talking about. Yup...people think he's gay now; and I'm one of them, but that still doesn't change what happened. And I regreat ever doing it!!! See, this certain someone had a crush on me and God only knows why I felt the same attraction but I did and I began to like him too. After school let out, he told me he liked me ever since December and I was like.."woah, really?" and he's all like, "yeah," and so then he kind of asked me out and I said sure......WHAT A STUPID THING TO DO!!!.....because all the girls who fall for him always end up getting hurt or end up hating him in the end. Which is what my fate was. I ended up going out with him for about 2 or 3 weeks WHICH WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO STUPID! I don't know why I even liked him in the first place, he's such a jerk with no heart. And the bad thing was, me and Courtney would get into stupid idiotic fights over him which lead to chaos. After a while I finally realized that he was stupid so I told myself to just forget him and move on. There will be other fish in the sea!!! Corny.....I know! But that's a depressing subject so I will move on.  No other major events happened during 7th grade that I know of, so until I'm in the mood to write another entry in this blog of mine, go shave yourself clean! Thank you!
