I was not as fortunate as them. My mom left my dad because of physical abuse caused by alcoolism, when I was only 3 and they separeted a few years later. Now remember that in the late 60's and early 70's it was not very popular to be divorced. My mom became both our parents since my dad was not very involved in our lives, unless it was his weekend of the month to see us. I went to boarding school and in my grade, I, with another girl named Kathy O, we're the only ones who had divorced parents. Now if you look at today's school and just pick one class, it really would be the opposite.  So in my eyes, the DADS of today, may he be single or married or widowed, may he be a grand-father in place of a dad or an uncle for that matter, for a little child, the role that a father has, in their lives, is a very important one and they should not be missing any part of it because in the long run, they will regret it, as my father did and still does. In my case, my Grandad was the man in my life but was called up to Heaven to become an Angel, in your eyes, to soon, HAPPY FATHER'S DAY GRANDAD FROM YOUR CENDRILLON.   P.S. My mom showed us to have respect for others and specialy to our father, so I did call him for Father's Day.....and prayed for him in church.   Have a great day and let's talk later.... Be good
