So I've decided to write about each and every day so I can figure out why it's so crazy.   This morning was hard, it really was. I said good bye to my best friends, and I wouldn't see them for a week. There was something bugging me too. Yes, I wasn't going to see my friends for a while, but I soon realized that it was because I wasn't going. I wasn't going to camp. I wasn't going to camp. I actualy wasn't going to camp. Any major even in the youth group i usualy come, but I wasn't going to camp. It was so hard to just deal with the fact, especialy when everyone was excited. All today I was going "I waunder what there doing now?" I really wished I went to camp, but then again, I really like having Speedy Reidy. You can't have them all, but I wish i could. Then the weirdest most weirdest thing of all was coming back to the church with Bill. It was an empty bus, no youth. It was fun, but no youth. Wow.  I played hockey today and it wasn't the greatest. I had a poor record (1-2-0) but it was nice to do something to get my mind of camp. I got hit in the shoulder so that kind of hurt. Then a guy took a shot at me with his stick in the arm. When I get home, theres a message saying hey Matt, you got to be at work at 5 instead of 6. No biggie for me. As I'm about to go, Dave Philips calls me and asks if I want to go to work with him tomorrow. Yes! I signed myself up so I'm going to work tomorrow at 8:30 in the morning! When I get home, i go back to work!! Haha! Oh man, crazy week.  Work was ok. I was really tired so I slacked. I made $265 in sales so that was nice! I got home earlier then expected and now bed is in my mind.   Day 1: Complete. Status: Hard, the emotions really got to me.
