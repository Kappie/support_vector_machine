You ask why i am here? I have to do an oral exam for french. Yes me who is half french and half english. It stupid to come into town in the morning for 5 mins.  I know that i will do well. I speak french like a speak english. So i shouldn't have any problems. No one is even on MSN. I think its too early in the morning to be here. There is a total of 6 people in the computer room. Its funny because yesterday i had to wait in line just to check my email. People wait last minute to do there essays. What is that about? why do we as students wait at the last minute to do everything? I had a 15 page paper at the begining of this week. You know what? i started it the day before. I think i need to get my ass in gear and get my papers done before. Ya right like thats going to happened. I always said it but never do it. Just like i said i want to quit smoke. Anyways i am going to go. Have a good day!
