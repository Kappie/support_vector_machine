Though , some people prefer it that way , I am really missing my voice. I cannot do the things which I like to do, for instance sing ( though tuneless). It gives me immense pleasure in irritating someone, though I think I do some goodbykeeping people around me informed about the latest happenings in the music world ,who are otherwise very engrossed in their studies.I miss yelling at Sinha too.  Now something about the March Past. ok, Manav and Abhinav (he is the other guy, Coordinator Mathematics Society) cannot march. They just can't. It was really hilarious seeing them get it right.   Yearning for my voice....... Manisha
