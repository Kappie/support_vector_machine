Heather has been biting my head off this week over any little thing that she doesn't like, and Marie, well she won't even talk to me. Why? Because I told her I didn't want to spend every waking minute of my day discussing her recently ended "love life" with John Green. HE broke up with HER. That's that.    Things are weird in school. All of the boys are bored because Danielle's taken (Alex's little brother, just a heads up), and she is not floating around anymore. Well, at least not as much as she used to. Aaron, well I do feel bad for the poor boy. But, hey, now he knows how that feels. The Melaro's are in stage band with me, and now I have someone to talk to. My classes are pretty cool this year: I am taking VHS too! Um...I'm getting treated differently because I am a varsity tennis player. Today MRS WILLIAMS of all people started to talk to me. And nicely, at that!   Oh, and at Marie's party last weekend, she dared Robbie to kiss me, and he did. I didn't even know he was coming until he was there, to tell you the truth. So today at the tennis match, he was talking to my sister and some of her friends, and was all like "I was thinking about taking Jennica to prom." Yeah right. I would be afraid, number one. I would give him the wrong idea, number two. And number three, no freaking way. He plans on TAKING me? Why not first plan on ASKING me?
