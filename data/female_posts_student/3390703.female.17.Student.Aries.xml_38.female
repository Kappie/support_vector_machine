On our way to/from Jewel she was talking about him and how she feels like his mom sometimes because she worries about him so much!  She hates the drugs and drinking and she said that she worries about him when he "dances" (lol, skanks), because of his heart!  She really doesn't want anything to happen to him and oh, she just loves him so much!   For awhile I would have done anything to break them up because we all know how in love I was with the boy!  But now I can see that he means so much to her, and I will never ever try to ruin that for her ever again!  Today Emilie's dad forgot to pick us up at 1 30 so we were sitting at school until 2 waiting for a ride home!  It was depressing, but fun because I got to spend that time with Emilie!   She brought a happy drink to school, and it made me happy . . . very happy!  :o)  Karina and Lori came over today and it was fun!  We were talking about college and our adult lives and how we want to spend all of it together!  Me and Karina are going to go to ECC for one year and then after that we are gonna go to The Art Institute!  We'll be there for one year, and then Lori will join us!  We're going to live in one of the triple dorm/apartment things!  We are going to go there for 4 years and then move to Sleepy Hollow, or somewhere like that!  Karina decided that we're going to have a summer and a winter house!  We haven't decided where our summer house is going to be!  Ohhh ... We are all going to live next to each other and our kids are going to go to preschool together and it is going to be so much fun!   Me and Karina are going to be cute moms and we are going to wear overalls and those fun peasent tops with bows by the tummy!  We WON'T be caught dead in spandex!  lol
