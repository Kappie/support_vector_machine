I'm just layin low not getting into any more drama before the trip. I dont think i'd be able to handle it emotionally. What I need is some good scandal. That can just get on its way ASAP because I was about ready to make a totally unexpected public scandal today, which would have probably been hott, but not such a great idea. I just thought I would let you know that what I said before was just me, as a girl, overreacting about dumb shit that girls do...Sorry, we girls are retarded, so any of you boys who want to come 'give me lessons' on how, um...not to be, um..retarded, or something like that ;) then come on, because i've always loved being teachers pet, and i can give you more than an apple...hehehe, sorry, its my dirty time of night, but there's no one to talk to besides Sara, but we're talking about toilets so...
