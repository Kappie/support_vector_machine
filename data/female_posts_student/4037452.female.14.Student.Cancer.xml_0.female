Of course, I guess it's no major secret, but in the end of it all I'm someone who values my privacy.At any rate I got a nice big surprise when I found out that three people from a different class no less had amazingly found out about this through their own mysterious and unnamable 'sources'.      Apparently, there's a certain 'rule' in this school. Of course, how should I know it? I'm the new girl. At any rate, once you receive wind of a new secret, you have to tell someone else, regardless of whether or not it's top-secret. Of course there's a rule to it - you can tell anyone you want, as long as he/she is trustworthy and doesn't get back to the first person that he/she knows the aforementioned first person's secret.And this pattern has worked quite well for my 'trustworthy little friend' over here. When I finally asked him straight-out, "Tell me the name of everyone who knows," expecting at the most maybe ten names. But then this same friend said in protest, "Practically the whole school knows!"      Aaaaahh...this whole secret thing was supposed to be tied up in a neat package, for me to resolve today with a simple, "No, I don't want to go out with you," and now everyone knows.    Great. Sheesh. The law of school rumours, huh? It's almost like a fascinating game of Chinese Whispers (you know, that game where you pass on some secret message), except way more annoying, and somehow, people always get the facts right..  .
