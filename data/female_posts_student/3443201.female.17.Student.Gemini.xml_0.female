I just watched and fasten my seatbelt.   >Enjoying they joyride?  Not at all.  Yesterday, it wasn't good.  My mom was crying.  And my dad? working.  I did what my daily routine was set.  Clean the house, watched TV, and so on.    Last night I planned to break my ways.  Instead of sleeping too early,I'm wide awake.  I was thinking of seeing MMK cause I really want to know that Filipino member in Black Eyed Peas.  It's just that sitting, and looking on the screen.  Watching this great Filipino who made his countrymen proud.  But I failed.  I locked my room and assuming that my parents didn't know I'm still awake, they fought.  Even they know, still they would.  Throwing each other harsh words.  I hate it!  I listened, as always.  I wanted to interrupt them but how?  I'm ready of having a broken family.  If it's for the better.  It would be hard though.  After all this year, there is no peace at all! I continues to worn my heart and torture my mind.  It's too bumpy over here and we should be extra careful. Come what may, and so be it.    I know God is at my side  .  Giving super strength and making me feel I'm not alone.
