And then tonight is the recital and my mom had to go to Vancouver so my Little sister and DAD did my hair okay! That's a little wired! But we had tons of fun getting me ready! LOL that night was fun! My friends and I hung out for one of the last times we went out side and watched the hockey game on a hand held TV!!! YAH! LOL it was a good game and brought a lot of excitement to us! LOL we had a blast that night.   We just got off stage on Thursday night and we were in our room talking when all of a sudden there was a bang and the lights went out all we could hear was screaming little kids and then after 5 min the emergency lights kicked in.  It was really scary.  So after about 1 hour and 45 min of talking to my aunt and uncle, watching skater guys and ect. They eventually decide to cancel the recital because the lights never came back on.  I am super tired so  Later Gator!
