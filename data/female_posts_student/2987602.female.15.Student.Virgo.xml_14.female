Ok so this weekend i have no plans so if i u wanna make plans call me or tell me 2morrow b/c u know how many ppl wanna make plans w/ me. But seriously i dont wanna b a loser so if ur not doin ne thing 2morrow please call lol. So today was a regular day, but one thing that was different was my perfect posture. Im telling you (the reader) it really works, when u sit w/ good posture u get like an ab and back workout, i really felt it today. Im gonna have really nice abs by next school yr im tellin you and all of u will be jelous and wish you had sat w/ good posture and i'll laugh at you hahaha. And im still pissed off bout all the fuckin regents they're (NY state govt ppl) makin me take. Y do i have to have 4 in 1 yr and 2 IN ONE DAY thats six fuckin hours of math and french wht the fuck is wrong w/ them have they no heart!!! Y do they give us 2 regents in one day but break up the english for 2 days? That makes no sense, wht us sohpmores arent important enough to get our tests split up but the jrs are? And mine is 2 tests not one so i have even more of a right to have it on 2 seperate days, this is just so messed up. As you can see this has been truly bothering me. Now back to my weekend, lets see...For friday: Chrisitna is seeing Harry Potter, Nicole is gone, and i don't think Dani wants to hang out w/ me so it looks like im gonna b alone. On Sat. Nicole will still b away, Dani is going to a concert, and I'll c if Christina is free. So i'm gonna have 2 see wht all my other friends are doing on friday but i have a feeling im gonna be @ home which really really sucks b/c i wanna go out but i just really don't wanna c Harry Potter lol i already know whats gonna happen so id rather just wait for it on DVD it's just wayyy to xpensive to see movies that i kinda sorta wanna c u know? Ugh so once again let me re-itterate my desperation for plans on Friday (lol) i just don't wanna be home alone so just call me or say something 2 me @ school... later
