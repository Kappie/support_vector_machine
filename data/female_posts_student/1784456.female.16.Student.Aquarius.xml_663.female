My foot really hurts cause my sandles gave me a big shiny blister. :( :( :( Oooh, why do none of my shoes fit! Well I am like size 8 or some thing admazingly ridiculous, but it's really annoying! My fingers and toes are too long! Eugh, enough of moaning, I'll save it for my mum so she'll get me new shoes! Any way, did any one watch Ireland v Germany today? I did! It ended up as 1 all but Ireland were playing waaay better and deserved to win! Yeah! Go Ireland! So any way, seeing as we're totally rubbish at football and we're gonna win (England) who should we back now? The little green men? Yeah, maybe some other random place though! Yeay! Hehe, who would think that every one cares about a little game so much? Ok, so that's why no one's blogged. Nothing to blog about! Hmm... oh yeay! My birthday on the 9th! I think I've said that about one million times already though! I'm gonna go... do Mr Fopple! Yeah! Even though I'm totally stuck! Oh well, bubi!
