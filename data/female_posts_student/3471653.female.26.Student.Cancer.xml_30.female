It's easy to use; you can google your own email if you're looking for something in particular; it has these things called "labels," which are like folders except you can put more than one label on each email (for handy cross-referencing); and it sorts email exchanges into "conversations." Very useful when I want to have a long email discussion with Tim or Jon or someone else.     Sorry to sound like a commercial, if I do.
