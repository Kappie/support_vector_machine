Maybe we need to build a prision in Croydon, maybe in the new Central centre. Drama exam was ok, had to stay at school keep an eye on the lights, got home about nine, some of the art was to a really good standard this year, well done everyone, however i must now urge all art and textiles students to remove their work, as soon as possible, or it will be removed for them, we have a show to do!!!  Talk to you all soon, see most of you tommrow, Dave
