Heather, Marie, and I all got along beautifully on the bus, and we were making homecoming plans! I THINK I HAVE A DATE! Heather called a boy today, and asked him if he knew anyone I could go with, and he said no, commenting that he didn't want me to go with any of his friends because he thought I was better than that. So Heather suggested that he take me, so he said he would, and that he'd ask me! Heather is going to go with Joe if she can, and now we need to find Marie a date. Homecoming is going to be a lot of fun this year!
