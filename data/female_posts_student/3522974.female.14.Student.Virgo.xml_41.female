(*sarcasm*) Neway, i am so sick of Art, more just the teacher,  Mrs. Borger . She is so cruel. If you ask a simple question, she will randomly start screaming and yelling at everyone. It comes to the point where we are not learning anything, because know one has the guts to ask her a question. Neways, also today my neighbour is coming over to give me a present. It's quite funny actually. For the last week and a half mum has been collecting their mail and puting their bins out while they were on holidays. Yesterday they came back, so mum went over with their mail, and Joanne [my neighbour] said  "Oh, thankyou soo much, i will come over tomorrow and give a special treat to Casey..."  and Mum is like  "errr....great".  lol. So now i get a lil prezzie for all mums hard work. I feel guilty, but mum says she doesn't mind. LOluv, kc.
