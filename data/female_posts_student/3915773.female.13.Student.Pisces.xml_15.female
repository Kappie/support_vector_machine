The official definition of an ombudsman is found on this page from the  urlLink Organization of News Ombudsmen :   "What is a news ombudsman? A news ombudsman receives and investigates complaints from newspaper readers or listeners or viewers of radio and television stations about accuracy, fairness, balance and good taste in news coverage. He or she recommends appropriate remedies or responses to correct or clarify news reports.         Why should a newspaper or broadcaster have an ombudsman? To improve the quality of news reporting by monitoring accuracy, fairness and balance.          To help his or her news provider to become more accessible and accountable to readers or audience members and, thus, to become more credible.          To increase the awareness of its news professionals about the public's concerns.          To save time for publishers and senior editors, or broadcasters and news directors, by channeling complaints and other inquiries to one responsible individual.          To resolve some complaints that might otherwise be sent to attorneys and become costly lawsuits.   The New York Times hired an ombudsman (they call him a public editor) after the Jayson Blair plagiarism scandal last summer. Daniel Okrent writes a regular column in the Sunday paper on a subject of his choosing that is not reviewed by other editors, so he can be completely independent. This week he addressed the question of whether the  urlLink New York Times is a liberal paper . His answer....on social issues, YES. He gives plenty of examples.  The column made me think of our conversation on Friday about news credibility and bias. How does this type of bias compare with the bias that many accuse Fox news of having? The answer is NOT to throw your hands up and just declare that all media are biased. What it means is that you must take responsibility to carefully chose the media you will use to form your opinions, understand how those various sources select and present their news, and balance your choices overall. Actively seek multiple points of view, and weigh them against each other. Take the time to stay informed about the important issues facing us as a society and a country. You all have important contributions to make to our future!
