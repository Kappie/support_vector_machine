Sure, they are attractive looking specimens but that is not enough to send a wind of calm in the ravaging fire that has become the subject of my rampage.       Skaters are stupid. I speak for the vast majority of them, but I'm sure at least 1.5% are not as incompetent as I presume. When you look up, past their Converses, past their Dickie pants, past their FOX t-shirts, and past their adorable beanies, you will see nothing but ungrateful, whiney, and corruptible behavior. Generally speaking they are but mere suburbian pre-pubescents who construct a paradise of concrete, rebellion, broken teeth. If anyone defies their "paradise" (i.e. parents, the government, "the preps"), they use their Superhuman Powers of Juvenile Insolence in order to get back at those who don't share their shallow and idealistic beliefs.       For example, I know a young man who went to biology class with me a few semesters ago. Everyday he would wear a navy blue kanga hoodie which had the screenprinted words "SKATEBOARDING IS NOT A CRIME." Of course it's not, you unhygenic baboon. However, skateboarding  is  a crime when abandoned lots and pedestrian walk ways clearly state "NO SKATEBOARDING" and yet you go ahead and do it anyway. Has the numerous injuries of past incompetence limited your reading skills?! Read it, BUCK-O. Don't even bring up the point that the government is secretly trying to bend you into its capitalistic tastes, you are just plain dumb. Use your common sense! Why do you think they posted up "no skateboarding" signs? Because you'll hurt someone!! Just as I'm about to hurt you right now!!!       Bikers, however, are almost as bad as skaters, but I guess the engineering flaws of the skateboard are much more flawed than a bicyle thus causing incalculable contusions and needless deaths of precious few braincells, which I doubt would be put into use even if they were rescued by a thousand lifeguards.       /end rant.       Today was rather uneventful. My sister will be gone for seven days. She's in Chicago right now visiting my aunt (my dad's older sister). That means I get the room to myself! Joyous relief. Now I can stay up as long as I want just as long as I go to sleep at ten! I expect to spend intimate hours playing my guitar and reading rejected books from a local high school. Or dancing.       I have taken a keen fancy to dancing lately. It's sort of like a mix between pop dancing, hip-hop dancing, and having a convulsion. Actually, it's not really dancing. It's flailing around like a monkey.            = Cristie
