But a lot of adults really don't understand what it's like to be 14 these days. They always assume it's the same from when they were 14. I mean I know there are similarities  but there are so many differences  and that's what they fail to see. These days, I don't really think the world is too accepting towards teens. Times change, I wish people would realize that. Just because there is  one  druggie-thief teenager  doesn't mean the rest of us are all druggie-thieves.  And then they play this whole thing on us about how the future is in our hands. Adults...uh! They just piss me off. Then again, most people piss me off but adults more because they are so oblivious by anything. Okay but back to what I was saying. So I've been thinking a lot and I realized a lot of things. One thing kinda became clear.... How many poets are actually ALIVE and famous? Silverstein was the only one and then he died... That's the only one I can think of! And that's not good! So I was thinking there's only a slim chance of me becoming this famous and well known poet in my lifetime. I mean Poe and Dickinson all became famous AFTER they died, and I don't want that. So I'm thinking about taking a different route. I believe a lot of writers have to do this at one point or another. I'm considering trying to write a book or series before I try to write a poetry book. I imagine that will be enough to get me "known." And then who knows? I might be the next Poe...or better yet please let me be the next  me...  Also, I think I'm starting to get over the whole caring what other people think of me thing. Which makes me very ectastic!
