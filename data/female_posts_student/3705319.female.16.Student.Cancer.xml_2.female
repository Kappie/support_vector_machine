Went to hosts house last nite for a bit of a welcoming party, the classic SA meal...baked potato, baked beans and mince!! They shared their prospects for the trip and their own testimony about how they ended up running a school in Capetown.  Early to bed to make up on some very precious lost sleep.  30th July 2004 Weather: wet and windy foggy and dark!! Up at 6:30am (ish).  went to school via one of Viv's famous "i know where im going" shortcuts.  Arrived at school eventually to a warm reception.  children all very welcoming and not afraid of meeting us.  we all met the pastor of the church where the school is held.  Some of us went to actual classes to help out and bond with the kids more with some well earn't football at break time.  School day finished early today because its friday.  After school we went to orphange/ HIV hostle. (!?)  some of us will be spending a few days here helping paint and spruce the place up a little while others do the same at school on monday. weather starting to look up.  Pray for: team time tonight that it will smoothly and that we can come up with some good ideas for camp and assemblies and ministry etc.  Prayer for Katy Ps travel, its a long story if u don't know...talk to chrisby!! Youth festivel tomorrow at church, that we won't make too much fools of ourselves! General preparation and team bonding!
