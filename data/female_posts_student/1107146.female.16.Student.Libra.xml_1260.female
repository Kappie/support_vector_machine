I remember when I was that young, there must have been like 20 billion people who wanted to shoot me.  Anyway, I'm better than you?  Wow, that's really sweet to say Linds.  You know all my bad qualities, yet you still think of me that way.  Awww....anyway, congratulations on math!  I wish I could say the same thing...yeh, right, like that'll ever happen.  Humm....yeh...I would say more, but there is nothing else to say.  I'll see you guys tomorrow.  By the way, did you know that BHS was having the Relay for Life tonight?  I went for a little while, but didn't feel like walking for 12 hours, so I left, but I did get a VERY cool sash and medal.  Boy howdy, are they neato. Peace out.
