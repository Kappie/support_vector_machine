Peppermints go in your mouth and freshen your breath for six seconds.  Peppermint oil is evil.  Last night, at work, I was rearranging the decorative lettuce on the bar, which is soaked in peppermint oil.  I wasn't wearing any gloves, because I was technically off, and helping out the waitresses.  BAD IDEA.  Peppermint oil burns everything it comes in contact with.  My hands started burning (like they were on FIRE) between my fingers.  I forgot once they stopped hurting, and rubbed my eyes, causing those to feel like I had poured tabasco sauce (or, how I envision tabasco sauce would feel like on the eyes).  Then, I had something in my nose, so I rubbed it.  That was probably worst of all.  Imagine pepper spray sprayed straight up your nose.  That about covers it.  I couldn't smell for an hour, just like drug dogs around cocaine.  Did you know that in WWII, the ppl who helped Jews escape would put cocaine in picnic baskets, in the boats, just about everywhere so dogs would lose the scent?  Sorry, but I love everything about the Holocaust and WWII, except the fact that so many ppl lost their lives.  I want to go to the Washington Holocaust Museum soooo badly, and to the one in my state.   Well my mom's been bugging me for the past fifteen minutes to hurry up so we can go to the Y, so I'll leave you confused.  Later.
