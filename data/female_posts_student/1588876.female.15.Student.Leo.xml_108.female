Darren was so kind and drove this little piggy home. they said something about a party last night and/or tonight.  i fuckin' hate it when my mother volunteers me for babysitting. this is why i have no life. i mean, i thoroughly enjoy the money, but when i would  rather go party, get drunk, and possibly get laid ...then i would like to seize the opportunity.  i want to party. damn i'm horny.
