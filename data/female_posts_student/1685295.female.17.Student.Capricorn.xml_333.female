Reminds me of the vaults in Fallout, HUUUGE stronghold with so many rooms you could rent them out for some extra cash. Its located in central Washington.  urlLink Check it out for yourself , all you need to call it yours is like $3'950.000,00. Looks like after paying that, you'd have no choice BUT to rent out the rooms.  I'm pissed off at the server which has my "webmaster" and "hatemail" addresses, so, if anyone sends any mail to either one of these, don't. I'm taking down the page iltrcoma.zzn.com soon too, of I'll just let it expire. I'll set up another account on like Y! or sumthin that I'd post on this site, apart from my OhgodYHerYHer account, which is flooded daily with junk mail. If any one knows any good servers for like hosting and e-mail address with a domain name of your choosing, hopefully free, lemme know.     Nirvana - Drain You  One baby to another says - I'm lucky to have met you  I don't care what you think  Unless it is about me  It is now my duty to completely drain you  A travel through a tube  And end up in your infection   Chew your meat for you  Pass it back and forth  In a passionate kiss  From my mouth to yours  'Cause I like you   With eyes so dialated,  I've become your pupil  You've taught me everything  Without a poison apple  The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student  Indebted and so grateful -  Vacuum out the fluids   Chew your meat for you  Pass it back and forth  In a passionate kiss  From my mouth to yours  'Cause I like you  You (x5)   One baby to another says - I'm lucky to have met you  I don't care what you think  Unless it is about me  It is now my duty to completely drain you  A travel through a tube  And end up in your infection   Chew your meat for you  Pass it back and forth  In a passionate kiss  From my mouth to yours  Sloppy lips to lips  You're my vitamins  Cause I'm like you    Oh great, another one of those "look-for-the-hidden-meaning" kinda things  I'm the Zenman, time down a few cool ones...what those ones are...I don't know...
