I HATE my cousin. ok, maybe not hate, but everything she does seems to fucking piss me off. whats her bloody problem!? she acts as though she owns my house. then her father, my uncle. jesus christ. i know he's an ex-headmaster and all, but he seems to think that everything he says is right, and no one should even dare correct him. i just cant stand it. i just dont think i'd be able tolive if both my cousin and uncle were staying with us for a whole week. 24hours a day, but thankgod. shes gone, and now i have the ex-headmaster and his wife to converse to. FUCK FUCK FUCK. and nearly everysingle people who we walk past, he says, "oh he has a typical indian face" or "oh shes definately from austria look at her bone structure" you've never even been to austria for fucks sake.your blooody japanese. shut up and be hell with it. gawd. stress stress stress. nothings really happening apart from all these family dramas. went to richmond yesterday, went to the pub. and whilst everyone was drinking water or coke, i drank "coke" too. - double JD and coke. hehe. i nipped off to the cemetary to have 2 fags. all is good.   now im home alone. once again. what a relief. mums gone to work. the unclaunt (uncle+ aunt)and cousin have gone to the national gallery before going to the proms to hear some elgar. tomorrow, is my cousin's graduation, from the London College of Fashion. fun  well im tired. and i really want to listen to some music, as ive been bared from my cd's as my unclaunt hate any music apart from classical.   BASTARDS ALL OF YOU!!!!!!!!  xxk
