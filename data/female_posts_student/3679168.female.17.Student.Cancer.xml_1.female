But whatever, then when I get home I have a senior cook out/sleepover for band there is only 20 of us so it's not tons of people it was fun but really weird at first. It was at ang's house so I went over there like at 2 to help her get ready and then people started showing up around 4 and I don't know it was weird. I think it's because I don't hang out with those people anymore and it was hard to relate to them at first. But by the end of the night everyone was getting along really well. We all went to bed around or something like that. Oh My. I lied the camp out was Sunday. What did I do Saturday then. Well it must not have been that important if I can't remember but I had to work Sunday morning and I got burned on top of my burn and now it hurt really bad and it blistering. Ouch! So any way Monday I had to work to and I only got paid 25 bucks what a rip-off. Then Monday we had a senior freshman cook out that was kind of fun but the freshman are really annoying. Well some are. They are loud and annoying. I mean I am too but I know when and when not to be. You know I can control my self. I made some new friends though. Freshman ones. Then after that I went home wasn't all that eventful. Today I had cheerleading at 8 it sucked we did our hour and a half work-out and then we mounted I got tore up cause of my sunbun but we almost have our 360 it rocks. I feel really bad for ang cause she got stuck with deneis and she's terrible and now ang is all like I want to base with Renee or I quite and I want to base with her too but Darcey and I are doing really well together we almost have a 360 with Rachel for god sakes. Rachel is the heaviest flier. Although she sure in hell isn't big! So cheerleading is crazy right now!
