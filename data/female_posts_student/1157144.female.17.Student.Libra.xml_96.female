(just some ideas, since i know we are all very bad at thinking of them.) >.  in other news, i am banned from coffee for today, seeing as i had two frappaccinos (yes, i know that is spelled wrong), which is quite bad... but ooh yummy yummy.... by all means, jessie go for the cabrio!! whooo... or get a hummer... haha, now THAT would be amazing.
