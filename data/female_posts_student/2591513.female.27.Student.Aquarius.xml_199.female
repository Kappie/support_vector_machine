I feel trapped, like I don't have anyone to talk to, but I know I have a few good friends who have told me countless times to call them when I need.  I am too embarrassed or maybe too afraid of losing my friends.  It is the one tough thing about losing two good friends at one time, you become afraid.   like Heidi, my NJ friend, she has stuck by me through some of the toughest times in my married life and she has asked countless times to lean on her.  But I guess all these feelings of anxiety come around this time, at night and I know she has two little girls and it would not be right to call this late.  UGH  Then these miserable migraines have kept me from doing the things I need to do.  I am so  FRUSTRATED !  Anyway, that is it.  I have to talk to a bunch of doctors tomorrow.  Wish me luck!
