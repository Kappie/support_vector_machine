O.O i'm going to be enchalada'd out after this...) AND drop me off at katlins, AND pick me up to make the stupid video.  =/   'sides that, nothing interesting today. again...   TOMORROW IS GINA'S GRADUATION! YAY! as well as THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL... well officially. the next few days are finals =/  gina's going to lv for memorial day. we were supposed to drive there because my parents are forclosing the montefrio house. so theyre going to pack everything up, but with the three day weekend, we'd stay there the whole weekend, and i have MAJOR stuff to do. =/ so they're heading up saturday while me n ry get to stay home...
