How many things did you swear that while they were happening you'd never forget them?  How many of those things do you actually remember now?  The synaptic pathways in your brain may not always allow you to recall offhand just what happened or why it was so damn significant, but there is one ever evolving, ever present, common thread in all of our lives that can bring any of us to those places that our neurons have seemed to forgotten the way to.    Each of us has a soundtrack to our lives, whether we're conscious of it or not, there are songs and artists and entire albums that shape each of these experiences.  Experiences that some of us may have chalked up as lost, things we might have wanted to hold on to, to keep close to our hearts because as those brief minutes of that song passed us by we were living moments of pure unadulterated emotion.  So pure, so joyous or so painful, so real and tangible to us in those moments that no matter how much it crippled our hearts and our being we just didn't want to let it go.  Raw emotion like that is so over-hyped today and yet, so fleeting.    Sometimes we hear just a few chords to a song from our soundtrack and the timbre rises loudly in our ears.  All our other senses cease and we're back in those moments.  Feeling the weather, feeling the pangs of emotion, smelling the air from that exact second that we've captured forever and we dive in and find ourselves awash in a sea of memories we thought were forgotten, our hearts reeling as we try to decide how we’re going to hold onto them this time.    If someone asked me to give a track listing to the soundtrack of my life I'm not sure what I'd list on it.  I'd like to think that my songs and my life would be an entire playlist on an ipod capable of being shuffled and repeated, more vast than a brief twenty songs stuck forever in a predetermined order by a C.E.O. at a record label.  Songs that while they're reminiscent of a scene in my own life aren't tainted by the cliches of a studio movie plot.  Everyday as I add another song to my collection I have this inherent need to replay and revisit those old songs.  Just to linger a few moments in what once was and how I got where I am now from there.    I won't tell you why I've chosen what I've chosen and who knows some of these songs might be on your soundtrack as well, but these are some of mine and each of them is so much more to me than notes and lyrics, they're moments gone but not forgotten. The Refreshments "Banditos" Any Beastie Boys track Debbie Gibson "Electric Youth" Etta James "At Last" Third Eye Blind "Motorcycle Drive-by" Jackson 5 "I Want You Back" Phish "Guelah Papyrus" Any Dave Matthews Band track from "Recently", "Remember 2 Things", "Under the Table and Dreaming", "Crash" or "Before These Crowded Streets" The Offspring "Self Esteem" Lucas "Lucas With The Lid Off" WuTang "Triumph" Green Day "Good Riddance" Any Maroon 5 track Eminem "The Way I Am" Indigo Girls "The Wood Song" Mariah Carey "Heartbreaker" and "Breakdown" The Roots "You Got Me" Grateful Dead "Cats Under The Stars" 311 "Love Song" (Yes, I know it’s a Cure cover) The Get-Up Kids "Mass Pike" The Used "The Taste of Ink" Blues Traveler "Hook" Triumph The Insult Comic Dog "Lick Myself" Fuel "Shimmer" Vertical Horizon "Everything You Want" R.E.M. "Nightswimming" Stevie Wonder "Signed, sealed, delivered"  There are a million more, but I only wanted to offer you all a smattering of what'd be on mine and maybe if you'd like to leave some of yours in the comments, I have some free iTunes songs and I'm looking for suggestions on what to choose.
