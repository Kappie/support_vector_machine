I had a massive  Global Security Policy  Exam this morning, however, as bad as that sounds I'm rather optimisitic about it. Lets see... topics covered were rogue states, Korean Policy towards the West and ViseVersa, China's anti-foreign policy advances, India and Iraq's new governments and types of terrorists and how to profile. Its a pretty awesome class, its just alot of info. The test was all essay, so my hand is now rather tired.   In reading for this class, I have found a rather interesting website written by an Iraqi citizen. Here is a quick exerpt. I found it VERY interesting. It is written by a girl who goes by the alias  Riverbend .   And through all this [bombings, torture cases, shootings],  Bush  gives his repulsive speeches. He makes an appearance on Arabic tv channels looking sheepish and attempting to look sincere, babbling on about how this 'incident' wasn't representative of the American people or even the army, regardless of the fact that it's been going on for so long. He asks  Iraqis  to not let these pictures reflect on their attitude towards the American peopleâ€¦ and yet when the bodies were dragged through the streets of Falloojeh, the American troops took it upon themselves to punish the whole city.   He's claiming it's a "stain on our country's honor"... I think not. The stain on your country's honor, Bush dear, was the one on the infamous blue dress that made headlines while Clinton was in the White House... this isn't a 'stain' this is a catastrophe. Your credibility was gone the moment you stepped into Iraq and couldn't find the WMD... your reputation never existed.     If you wish to read more (and there is plenty) the URL is http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/   Anyway, back on this continent called  Valdosta , life is going well.  Scott  drove through town last night and it was good to see him. He seemed rather "chipper" to me, and it is always good to see friends in a good mood.   However, yesterday was not the best of days for others. I know  Irene  had her end of the year concert, and from what I understand it went well... just stressful.  Rick  had another "incident" with his car... not really sure what yet. I know it involved a ditch.  Eric  ran out of gas and upon returning to his truck realized that he had locked his keys in it, and  Stephanie  had some sort of water pipe break under her house.... I hope that all of you are okay - let me know if I can help.  In other news,  Caroline  returned from her vacation cruise yesterday. Seems she had a very good time.  Gary  successfully defended a client at his intership (law office) so he was excited... good job Gary.  Brad  moved half of his stuff to Peachtree City... to finish next week. Thats it in a nutshell folks: Valdosta.  I'm rather amazed at how pathetic some students in college really are. I witnessed four presentations at the school on Wed. and they all were total shit. I mean, geez folks, this presentation is 25% of your final grade, go ahead and ace it so you can have a good grade... not to mention respect from other students. My presentation on National Security will be on Tuesday... so I'm actually about to get started with that when I'm done with this.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Because I'm bored...
