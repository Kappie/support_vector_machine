Like very fun... Very happy for her...      Just now met Yoru downstairs... She wants to seek my opinion- if I would like to go K-box with her friends... Actually, on second thoughts, don't mind lah but I wouldn't be veri comfortable coz I don't even know her friends... HOWEVER, from Yoru words, can see that she starts to enjoy school life very much... Very happy for her also...      Actually... I know you guys wouldn't forget me... (maybe for your entire life) coz we actually spent quite some quality time together in BN... But don't know why.. Just can't stop thinking about my sec sch.. I don't miss it as much as I do during April (When I started JC) but.. still can't bear to "fang kai".. Can't stop thinking of the classroom...       Yoru.. maybe at this point of time, you might feel that I am toooo obsess with BNSS... Haiz.. its a funny feeling... don't know how to describe.. Friends in TP are good.. but can't stop thinking of you gers... haiz.. don't know lah.. (Write till here, start to feel a bit down coz begun to miss sec 4 even more) haa haa...      Wah.. I like writing compo.. Yoru.. hope that you can just read this post.. I think you don't have to like "an wei" wo (don't know if you intend to a not.. haa haa) coz actually what I have written here is not exactly how I feel too.. I juz can't describe my feelings in words... haiz... At this point, can only say.....      I miss the very fun time we had at BN... Anyway, really happy that all of you guys are fitting well in your schs... Very glad to see that (this is my zhen xin hua)... Forget me Not!!!! Good Nite... Muack...      Natsu
