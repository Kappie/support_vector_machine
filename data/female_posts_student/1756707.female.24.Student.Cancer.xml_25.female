I kept having good ideas, and wanted to stay up all night and think some of them through, write them through as a way of thinking about them -- but I have to sleep at some point.  But I was feeling so brilliant and coherent, it seemed a shame to waste that on sleep.  So I talked to Greg online for a while, and was ranting about my brilliance, and here's a (partial!) list of the stuff I was thinking about yesterday:  *jobs  *options after grad school  *ideas for teaching next semester - moving the literacy journal assignment to the beginning of the semester, talking more about "the bare minimum" on assignments the way Jody does, new ways of organizing the semester, focusing on literacy, the university rather than literacy and language  *revising my syllabus  *ideas for a project/publishable paper on dance composition (choreography) and process and writing       studies *work on the project i'm doing for peter's class on the syllabus for the class that trains new instructors  *work on the textbook archiving project i'm doing for the same class  *work on the paper i'm writing for debbie on literacy in ancient greece and its relationship to ancient literacy and literate practices *new ways to think about the relationship between lit and comp in my department *conversations i had today (with Peter, Paul, Oday, Jody, Nicole and Derek)  So I have much to think about -- and the week isn't over yet.  I love my life being this way -- it's good, productive, intense, packed, moving -- and very difficult.  I can't imagine any other life -- or perhaps I can't imagine not wanting a life where I'm so intensely involved and engaged.  I am certainly capable of imagining a life outside academia.  So yes, much to think about.
