I had almost forgotten... I also forgot how white my skin is and now my hair is so dark that I look like some sort of porcelain doll. But so that's what I did today. And I lost my favorite belt (well my only belt, my studded one) somewhere, I thought it was in the dressing room of Nordstroms but I went there today and it wasn't. That's depressing. It rained today. That's depressing too. And it's only Tuesday. That's extremely depressing. But tomorrow is Wednesday, which means Art Club and Charlotte-and-Natalie movie night (Harrison Ford month continues with... "RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK"! Now Showing in Natalie's Room).  And then it's Thursday!
