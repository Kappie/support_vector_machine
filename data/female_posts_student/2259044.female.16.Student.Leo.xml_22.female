Things happen and im just plain stupid, i take things in a weird way, sometimes im happy, sometimes mad, sometimes big things don't even phase me, but small things, those are wut get me, some how i just over-analyze everything untill it turns into a big deal, that it's not. anyhow, i've been so over-stressed lately that i haven't had time enough to think things thro, but last nite i did some major thinking,  (mainly bcuz i had THE MOST STRESSFUL day) anyhow, each day this week has been busy, crammed, stressful, and confussing, and surprisingly, altho today was about the busiest day yet, i was really calm and collected becuz i'd had my thinking time. u guyz really don't care, i no, but if u really didn't care, then y r u still reading? exactly, i no that SOMEONE out there cares enuf about me to want to know more about me, and how my mind worx, so if u've stayed tuned this long, i just want to say, thank you, and that im glad that u actally bothered to try and figure me out, maybe u can tell me more about me, cuz i sure don't get me. and now that i've confused u once again, i'd just like to let u no that i appreciate u, and everyone else in my life, life's tuff and i've had a LOT of help, so anyhow, thanx, changedfish
