I can't wait. I am so excited.  I hung out with a bunch of friends last night in the crew bar.  Didn't get back to my cabin until after 3AM so I was exhausted this morning.   I just finished for the afternoon so I think I will go and continue watching the first season of 24.  Damn, I am so addicted to this show.  Unfortunately, my friend John bought this season as a rip off in China so the last few episodes are caput. I am pissed about that already. I am going to have to find the these last few discs somewhere!    Meanwhile, work is going fine - just finishing  the last few days of training Linda (my replacement).  I can't wait to hand everything over. I started cleaning my desk today. I took down all of my bazillion photos and gathered all of my contacts from my files. I just need to swipe my email and clean out everything that is not needed. Yippee!!  Tomorrow we are in Juneau from about 1:00pm until 10:00pm.  I am looking forward to getting off the ship and breathing some fresh Alaskan air again.  The weather has been crummy today with drizzling rain and lower temperatures.  It reminds me of the fall in Texas - only this time I can't hear the sound of tires wheeling through the puddles.  I miss those simple sounds, guess I will have an "ear" full when I get home...  Must run for now but I send my love to everyone and I can't wait for the ECI Alum meeting. Smooches.  Shell
