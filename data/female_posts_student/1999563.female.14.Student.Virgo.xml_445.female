At least my cucumber was saved. Yay! Then I am going to a play called "Hello Dolly" It should be muy interesante.  A kid from my church is in it. Haha.    Yeah... Tomorrow is opening night for charloettes web! how exciting!  Haha I think I miught go to the post show party. Its at burger ville and I REALLY want a milk shake. But I don't want (Evan says hi) [He says he is avalible..hmm... *wink* *wink* [That was evans doing also..] Anywho..I don't want to always be at the show because it gets really boring after a while. But oh well.   I am in history right now.  Emily was like "WHY WONT MY STUPID PAPER PRINT?!?!?!?!" And as it turns out she forgot to press the print button. Hahhaha. She is blonde at heart. I think she used to be blonde when she was a little kid.  Today in science we did an experiment with slinkys! It was AWESOME!! We made Melissa do all the work and Daniele and I just played with the slinky. He got it SOOOOOO tangled it was really bad. We thought we were going to get in trouble but then Melissa untangled it. Yay!  In science we switched our persuasive papers and we had to argue against them [Evan wants you to IM him- daredog56] and I had to argue against Tony's paper and his paper was about how dumb keryy is. Haha. So I was like "Kerry rocks!!" Hahha. It was kinda bad..but yeah. Since i went to that convention thing I knew alot of pro-Kerry arguments. Haha.  Now everyone is tlaking about how I am advertising Evan via the internet. Eric thinks its funny. SPeaking of them two...MArc got his braces off and Eric got his cast off. What a dealio. Well, I don't feel like writing ANY MORE!!  Bye!!!  You buddy for ever. [For ever and ever you'll stay in my HEARTT and I WILL LOVE YOU forever and ever]  laura FANTORA
