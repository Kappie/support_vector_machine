The description of Durante and the overall setting greatly contribute to the meaning of the story because. The setting shows a tough time that Durante had faced and how rugged it was. Also, the author really makes a point of how dry it was in that desert by telling us about how people died when they are dehydrated.   The description of Durante contributed to the story because it portrayed what kind of person he was and what he would do to get out of bad situations he had created for himself. When he shot the water tanks, it showed us that he didnt care much about anyone else, but only for himself. The consequence for this wrong-doing was Tony giving Durante a canteen of wine, instead of water. When Durante took his first big sip of this fluid, he realized it was wine and became angry and already knew that he was going to die in the desert like his father.
