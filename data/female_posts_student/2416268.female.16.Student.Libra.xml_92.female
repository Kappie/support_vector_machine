Ok so what day is it today…………ah yes it is a very beautiful Saturday, the sun is shining, the birds are singing and I’m sitting here looking out of the window watching out for burglars. I don’t suppose that makes any sense does it, well I will try to explain in a manner that you can somewhat comprehend. This morning as my mum was leaving for work she caught a couple of people ‘casing the joint’ – they were basically saying stuff like “I think that’s the front door over there – number 9” – that was while the man was looking over the top of the fence to get a better look. They didn’t see my mum however, so I’m sitting here on my todd waiting for them to re-appear, and if they have the balls to do so, then God help them when the try and get in, they will have to kill me first, so if I’m not in for the test on Monday you no why. Lol, nah I’m sure there was nothing in it, but you know what parents are like, worry worry –“make sure you lock up properly, don’t answer the door to anyone you don’t know” as if I would leave the door open and invite them in for a cuppa tea. I mean I know I am blonde, but I’m not that blonde……. am I?  Ahhh yes it is Saturday, today is the day I am getting my haircut, woohoo, I can’t wait, just hope it looks okaledokalee…………..Ooh then tonight is Vic’s sleep over, yay, that reminds me must go out and get some wrapping paper!! I just know it is going to be a funkadellic night!!  Ok shall right some more at a later date  Love ye all Love your Nat xXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxXx
