I'm only going for saturday. -A day trip to  urlLink Särkänniemi  amusement park, located in Tampere. -and anything I can come up with  August: -work ends. I have 2 weeks of real holiday. -traveling back to uni and possibly going to Sari's summer cottage with her. It's located not too far from Savonlinna. -finally going to explore urlLink  Olavinlinna castle  which is located right here in Savonlinna.  Although I have sooo many plans, I'm going to relax as well, as much as I can from work! This is going to be one good holiday... *sighs with anticipation* :)
