I mean, I guess I could have been a smart kid and stayed home tonight and gone to bed at like..7:00 but nah...I ended up at john's house. It was actually really fun. it was Kel, Kath and me of course. Then, John already had some people over. Brett, Jamal, Faisil, Matt Allan, and Sam. So, that was a lot of fun. I don't get to hang out with them much. I played pool and actually won. I mean, my second to last shot, I did take while sitting on the pool table (a classic Faisil move) but still, it was awesome. We tried to watch Boondock Saints but with so many of us there it was too difficult.   Oh, it was hilarious. John and Jamal made these mugs out of wood and...I don't even know...just mugs made out of wood is funny.   Haha, I am so tired right now I can't even like...think straight. Wooo. good night to all and to all...a good night...
