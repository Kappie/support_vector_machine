I just got back from a design interns meeting. The last.  Which made me forget about the paper. Hah. B/B+. I honestly can't complain, since the grade is better than I expected. It's one of those rare, uncomfortable moments when you don't dare flip the comments sheet over and read it. But I did. Nothing I didn't already know, really.  I'm glad I'm here before I have to go into college, so I know what kind of ego-trampling just one difficult class does to me. It hasn't been traumatic or anything, but it's one of those things that irritate you and eventually force you to realize that you're probably not all that great in the real world. I honestly don't expect an A in lit since there are obviously more intelligent people in there who actually deserve good marks. I'd be troubled if I got an A, honestly. I mean, I've done the reading religiously, but there's just something about the paper and the level of interpretation that I have yet to grasp. It's completely different from anthro, where the papers there are mere book reports or compilations of research on a certain topic. Nothing too deviant from the familiar ways of high school work.  It's just weird. I'm not too bothered by that grade at all. Though I think if I continue this attitude into college I'll be running into problems.  Today's been a full day, at least. I was ten minutes late for breakfast, but I finally did practice piano. I learned how to sign in/out, find a room, etc. The music department here somehow reminds me of the one at UC Davis, particularly in the sense that I got lost looking for the practice rooms. But it's really more than I can ask for. I found my room (the rooms are oriented in clusters, like UC Davis's) and there was nobody in the adjacent rooms so I didn't have to gape at someone else's better playing when I wasn't making music myself. I literally yelped out loud when I opened the door, turned on the lights and saw a Steinway grand. It's a bit old and well-loved, as public pianos are, but it still sounded all right. The pedal is more sensitive than the one at home, but it'll teach me to pedal discriminately. I wonder how they fit the pianos in there in the first place. I imagine the pianos haven't seen any other environment than the practice room in thirty years. There's also a mirror to the right, so I can see my elegant slouch when I play. That's sarcastic, of course. I went over Schumann today for about an hour and 45 minutes, and didn't even finish. It was nice to get the fingers warmed up again. I thought, I should do this between breakfast and lunch every day from now on, but...  I found out I have a response paper due Thursday, and the lit paper and the anthro research paper due August 12, next Thursday. I have an idea that the rest of my days are going to be spent reading and writing. It's all right, I guess, but there's just the pressure to produce something tangible, instead of just doing the reading and having the prof assume that you read. But I've been keeping up with that, too, so I hope that helps. Andrew's coming August 8. So much for pure fun.  One day Jenn and I will ride the T just back and forth, not getting off until we wind back up at Harvard again. Jenn wants to go to Wonderland, at the end of the blue line. How great does that sound? "Trains to WONDERLAND." Or, "Where are you going?" "Wonderland."  It's weird. "Wonder," "wonderful" and "wonderland" have different nuances about them. I think "wonder" is German. Or it sounds German. Maybe it's from the word  wunderkind , as in Mozart, stored in the back of my head.  Journalism questions: how does one have a staff exclusively for layout? Should we do that? It'd cure consistency problems quite a bit, but it'd be difficult to communicate on articles and proofreading, etc. Wouldn't the layout people have to finish the layout first? I think we should get better center spreads next year too. Or just better stories.   Pale Fire  is amazing.  Ew, that gets me thinking of my old thesis. Should I keep it?  Let's end on a happy note.  Listen to the Strokes.
