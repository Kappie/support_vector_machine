Connie and Carla was funny, especially if you're a gay man. Goes without saying that Josh liked it. Hehe. Then we watched Kill Bill Vol.1 and HOLY CRAP it's so gory. Wow. But now I have to see the next one. Charlotte's gonna live here for a couple days next week, her mom's going somewhere. I can't stand her. It's gonna be hell. JUST KIDDING! Sleepover every night! Except.. not.. cause like we have school. Yeah. Oh I was asked to make the backdrop for the Battle of the Bands... I also wish I had the balls to try out for it. Dammit. It's not really bands specifically but like a talent show that's just music. So I could sing. Josh thinks I should but yeah... this whole year I've been imagining singing in a talent show but when the oppurtunity comes up I split. Sometimes I hate myself. Sigh.
