Let me explain why:   New Threat: Saturday the 14th  No, I can't have bad luck on Friday the 13th, I have to have bad luck on Saturday the 14th, which in case you didn't glance at your calendar, is today. Work is such a pain, and so it should be when your working for a fast food coffee place. Lets see I....    1. Spilled coffee everywhere  2. Broke a cup  3. Got scolded and  4. Got nasty, nasty looks from customers of all ages.   Your thinking, "Regular day, right?". What is regular?? I am new, I haven't been trained to recognize "regular". *sigh* O well, I'm sure it'll get better. Just in time for camp (I hope I hope). I don't need to be starting camp with a chip or 5 on my shoulder. *cough* ok, new subject.  Have you seen that commercial about the trunk monkey. Dude, I want a trunk monkey.   Quote of the day. "From the moment I wake up, I reach for my smiley face cup..... and pour coffee enough for 2.... forever and ever and ever we'll be."
