NOPE Don't think so. yea but anyways....  Jake was talkin to me today about like grooms-men and bride maids and maid of honnor. I think i know who i want mine to be i just have to get her to agree to it first. (Jessi.....I don't know how to day this but.....Will you be my ...Maid of Honor???)Lol sorry had to do that felt this great urge to. O well u gotta tell me one way or another cuz i only have 6 more years to plan this. God i better get started tomorrow. LOL! J/K. Yea even Mr. Turner says he can't picture Jake's future life with out me in it. Suprise suprise. Hey wow i just thought of sumtin only 6 more days till i get to go to ceader point with my Jacob SWEETNESS.  Ok i got called an over-acheiver by Header. Of all the ppl to get called that it was me.
