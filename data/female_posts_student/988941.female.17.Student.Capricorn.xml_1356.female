I dunno, maybe I'll try it out a bit.  I'm listening to Run by Snow Patrol. Marvellous. I'm also very wet, cos I've just got back from doing my paper round, where the heavens decided to open. Am also a tad stressed about impending exams and whatnot, but should be OK... first one is Critical Thinking on Tuesday.  Gah, I'm gonna be at school virtually all half time rehearsing for the school play. Bah.
