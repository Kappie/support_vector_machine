I thought it you did a very good job considering the fact that you only worked on it in a day or two.      Ching:  When you mean resizing the pictures, you meant resizing it through something like Adobe Photoshop, correct? All of the pictures that I uploaded to Goldensushi's FTP are resized and edited already. Just let me know what would be the ideal size that you normally use.
