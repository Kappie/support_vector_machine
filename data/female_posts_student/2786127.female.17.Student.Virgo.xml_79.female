Lagging around the house, occasionally turning on the t.v., getting bored of it, checking my email (with high hopes, to almost always be shot down) and then sulking around wondering why no one ever calls me? During the school year if I ever got bored after school I could just take a nap...but now that summer is around and I'm getting plenty of sleep everynight I can't take naps anymore because I'm not tired. So in a way its like I'm trapped in boredom hell.  I'm thinking I've become a staci...no one wants to hang out with me anymore. I called Ashley yesterday and she told me I could come along with her today to the job offices to find a damn job...and she said she would call me. She didnt call all day, so i finally decided just a few minutes ago to call her to see if we were still going. First thing i ask her is "whats up?" and she said" filling out a job application."  ...  She went without me. What the fuck? God...if you don't want me to come, don't fucking invite me. Christ. I'm so sick of people. Apparently they're sick of me too.
