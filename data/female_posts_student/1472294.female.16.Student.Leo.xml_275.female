As you already know, or I have already realised myself, I fanatic about dolls. Ha! So a real close-up pic of her. Whew! Thanx for Hello! Oh, the holidays are coming, but I cannot damn feel the holiday spirit. Urgh. My progress report sounded quite badly and negatively. And yes, I still loathe maths. What's the problem if you are quiet? I am very confused... Hmmm... I shouldn't have go to school today, ya know. I could have stayed at home and slack. I missed my friends a lot. Yesterday, we went out for dinner and everything was so fun and we just laughed and teased and well, just had fun! I am currently in the school library rambling nonsense, and students around me are surprisingly, rushing for their powerpoint presentation. Whoa, no wonder I cannot feel the holiday spirit...
