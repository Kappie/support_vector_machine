I guess by a crude calculation, I'd run out of money (and gas) at 19,040 miles, which is a lot. But don't expect me to know the tank capacity of the car or the price of a tank or the MPG. And I really wasn't hoping to spend money accumulated from elementary school hong bao and such on gas, which I only vaguely enjoy, and that's only because it keeps a car running.  Hi, this is terribly spoiled of me.   Mom's a paradox, then. Ok, so she pays for insurance, and I stop tutoring. But if I'm going to generate some money for the gas and I don't want to tap away at savings (I was also planning to use this at Harvard) then I'm going to have to do something about it.   Seriously now, I'm not going to have time to get a job. After AP's, maybe, but that's just about a month before I leave for the east coast. I was planning on working summer after senior year just as a growing-up experience, but that really doesn't help the present situation. It's simply disappointing that they don't get it. I'm not lazy, and I'm not planning in squandering gas, but I really don't have the time to find a means to pay for it. This Saturday, I have SATIIs (which, by the way, Mom confused for the APs--now that's why you should tell her about your life! because she turns around and even messes up the order!) and a piano competition. Sunday's the car wash, Grandma's bday dinner (ick). I'd really rather go to the English review session and go out and have dinner with friends. It's easier, wouldn't you agree? I wouldn't have to dress up (and just stay in shorts all day), I wouldn't have to be badgered into playing violin (I've already declined, but Asian women never stop), I wouldn't have to see the photographer and flash another fake, fake smile, I wouldn't have to see relatives I don't even know about, I wouldn't have to be in San Gabriel until late at night, I wouldn't have to ride in a full car all the way out there...I hate this.   The irony is, after I told Mom that I'd probably have to start tutoring again, she says gaily, "Well, remember to manage your own time well." Thank you, Mother. Either you've finally learned to keep out of my schedule (APs on weekends, etc.) or you're simply using that as an excuse, as you certainly haven't managed to stop managing my schedule.  I just resent that my parents are so two-faced about issues. And the thing is, I can't really fight it or else it'll turn into some full-scale argument which will eventually result in the realization that no, they don't have to feed and clothe and house me, so they might as well just kick me out. It's AP season. I can't afford that right now.
