Now for those of you that are pro-Stern as I am, you will have already set your alarm clock to the channel, anxiously anticipating the morning you'll once again awake to Howard, Artie,  Robin.  Right now, K-Rock is in the process of defining their playlist which would explain why the past four mornings I've been awakened by the Cure, Led Zeppelin, and Billy Squier among other eclectic and highly annoying acts.   For those of you all about the rock, I strongly recommend visiting the following site and answering the 200+ survey that will help the station tailor their format to listener requests.  My friend Amy and I just filled it out a mere five minutes ago, our only comment was a three line plea for Tenacious D  the White Stripes.   Ok, enough about me -  urlLink Take the freakin' survey!
