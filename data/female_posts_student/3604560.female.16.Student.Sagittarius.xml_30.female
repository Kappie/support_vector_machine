There was like a whole day of cable dedicated to the dude, you can tell he was an actor because the funeral was huge, with all the trimmings. I have honestly realized that the greatest amount of pollution this year will have come from the like 10 minute gun salute they had for him,.. i mean really was all that smoke necessary? sorry, like no disrespect to the dead and all but what a huge waste of money, and should i stop now, i don't think this site was for me venting my opinions  good day everyone,  FARSCAPE LIVES ON
