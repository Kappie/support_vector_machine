Alice, Helen, Lucia and I were sitting in the band room hall during lunch. We were talking about last semester when Ms. N was giving a random lecture on STDs. She was going on and on about how people with STDs were not bad people and ended up sharing a bit too much about herself. She told everyone present that she had genital herpes then tried to cover it up by saying, "But I didn't get it from my husband! I got it from school...". Of course, the whole class started backing away from her. I'm not really sure I want to know what she meant by that.  I think I broke myself in Math. Alice, CeCe, Maija and I were working on a quiz together. About 30 minutes into class everyone was pretty quiet and concentrating on the quiz.  I muttered "Father figure sex." without realizing I was actually talking. Leave it to me to disrupt perfect concentration with something absolutely... Different. Luckily, only a few people around me actually heard what I said and we all burst out laughing. Alice and I were practically crying by the end of class. God, don't even ask what I was thinking about.  Tech class was absolutely hilarious, Stephanie and I spent the first 10 minutes complaining about how hungry we were. Finally Steph ran over to Mr. F and screamed "Me and Angela have to PEE!". Surprisingly he let us go. So we grabbed some cash and went downstairs for a snack. We spent ages raiding the vending machines, they're very generous with the free food. I don't know why they haven't been fixed but a dollar can get you  everything   in the machine. It just keeps spitting the dollar out until you have everything. Quite useful. We made our way back upstairs with more junk food then we could possibly eat, dumped most of it in the room and went back outside to find Steph's friend Ben. He was actually in his class for once. Steph opened the door to his class to get his attention but couldn't distract him so she slammed the door shut and we took off down the hall back to our class. She was wearing flipflops, so you hear "SWISH FLOP SWISH FLOP" echoing though the entire hallway. We ducked back into Mr. F's right as a very angry teacher burst out of Ben's class and stalked off screaming about disrespect. Mr. F didn't even notice our absence. How sad is that?  After school I had to go home and put my contacts in. I'm not supposed to wear them at school for the first week and I discovered why today. I was at the mall with my mum when my contacts decided to attack me. Not even kidding, they want me dead or blind or something. It was horrid, my eyes were watering everywhere. Gah, I finally managed to get them under control but looked like a doofus. My eyes were all puffy and red. I decided to find some heavy duty under eye concealer stuff, so while my mum was in the Bon I walked up to a random cosmetics counter and was seized by a scary make-up counter lady. "Hello! Can I help you?" "Yeah, I was looking for an u--" "Under eye concealer?" "Yeah, actually.." Anyway, this lady grabbed my head and applying things to my face. In the end I managed to spend $30 on the smallest tube of concealer ever. But, at least it works really well.
