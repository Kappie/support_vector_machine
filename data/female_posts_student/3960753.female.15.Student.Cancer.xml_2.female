I think that maybe by being an A student baby I could win your love for me. Don’t know much about the middle ages. I look at the pictures and I turn the pages. Don’t know nothing about no rise and fall. Don’t know nothing about nothing at all.Boy its you that I’ve been thinking of. And if I could only win your love. What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be.  What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
