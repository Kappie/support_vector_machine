"Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house. 'If only,' she wrote, 'you had also forgotten your heart! I should have never let you have that back.'"  The only other time when I felt such an acute sense of empathy was in Tender, when Nicole pines after Richard.  There's so many couples walking around Cambridge...  And I'd like to think I'm stronger than that? Well, it shouldn't be important now.
