Imagine growing up with people expecting you to be like some one, some one that you can't be. What if some one died and then a baby was cloaned from their genes. Imagine knowing that you are purely alive because of the person you got the genes off. Cloaning is a way of being 'god' and I'm not sure I agree with it. A baby who has the original genes of a sixty year old will infact have the frailty of their bones, is it fair to do that to some one?  Hmm.
