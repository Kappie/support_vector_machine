It's about this one guy who seduces an entire family, without any of them knowing about the others... it is absolutely hilarious. It should be restricted, but it's hilarious. Something's Gotta Give is funny too -- I'm gonna end up being like Erika. Except not as famous and beautiful lol. And Prom Queen! Inspirational comedic cheesiness! Gotta love it, man. Go see it. It's awesome.   So anyway, I've been doing science study notes the whole day, and I should probably continue doing that. What I'm especially worried about, though, is the music playing test. Ahhh! I can't play the flute, man!! I suck!!! T.T   So I'm gonna go now. Nivbed has got some awesome muzak, check out Pandora.
