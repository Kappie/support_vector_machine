Mine happened yesterday around 2:42 p.m. I sent a very ill timed text message and then slapped my forehead *DOH* now i'm a smart girl. I know better but sometimes? well..... I get impulsive. I pressed send and two seconds later I realized that I had made a horrible mistake.   Something my mom would do. Oh QUEEN of zero self control...  I thought I bit this in the butt with my super high g.p.a. I thought i could reason my way out of an insanity that plagued 9 aunts.. my half sister and my cousin....    After a huge fight with my dad that would include the dessimation of some furniture or wall, or throwing the next day she'd be totally sweet as if nothing had happened as if this kind of behavior was acceptable.  it drove my dad insane....he'd still be simmering needing his space and she'd act like she wasn't trying to kill him the night before   It's pretty awful, especially when you hate her.... What? oh yeah...I have a mother yes...my parents are still married. yes ....they live in the same house but SHE is dead to me that fucking bitch.... and guess what? ............  The impulse to think that everything was ok just because everything was ok with me took over. As if it's ok to fight and make up like nothing ever happened. I've been finding other clues..... such as the names i've been called  selfish,manipulative, self absorbed... this is scary people. I've spent my whole life trying not to be like this woman   I'm the poster child for abortion  I carry guilt for never being enough I blame myself for shit that's not my fucking fault   "breathing sweet you'll never be anything's down her back"  -McS   Happy Mothers Day Bitch
