Neways, back to what I was planning to say. Tommorow, as you conformed S'poreans know, is my school's pre ND[National Day] celebration. Wait, let me correct that, as you conformed Chung Cheng-ians should know.   Last year, towards the end, everything was so chaotic and just outta the world, we had so much fun, hands on shoulder, just running about in groups. There were some moshing as the aforementioned leader of  the groups  kept sudden-breakin. We kept banging into one another.  Ahhh....The fun of self-inflicting pain.... ________________________________________________  Mosh me! ohfreak [dot] blogspot [dot] com
