I'll hysterically post really long crap for about a week, then start posting about one online quiz result every two weeks, with a rant somewhere in between. But I think this will be different, because I'll actually have a motivation... The wrong kind of motivation. BUT I won't say anything about that because if I say everything I want to say in one post then I'll fall into the bad pattern of my previous blogs. Therefore, I shall resist to the temptation of writing all about what 'motivation' lies ahead... At least until my next post. But in this one I'll write a quick intro.  I am I, Gab the First. My name is Gabrielle. I like some stuff and dislike other stuff. The stuff I like includes pineapples, the word "pancr√©as", and online quizzes. Stuff I don't like includes the color brown, indigestion and pepper. I like wasting people's time. And I'll shut up now.  Gab
