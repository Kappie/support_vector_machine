Our front door was being used as a soccer goal, scooters and bikes were discarded in the middle of the road, Stupid Head was screaming that he was going to run over them. The two-year old had climbed onto the roof of a truck and was jumping up and down with ear-splitting bangs as her mother stood six feet away, chatting obliviously with a neighbor. It was sheer chaos. This has been the scene for months, ever since the new neighbors with the three obnoxious children moved in. On top of this, the senile old lady next door continues to scream day and night about her obscene little dogs.     Yesterday my mother snapped. Our neighbor, the Teacher Guy, sat under our window playing his ukulele very badly, which prompted the screaming neighborhood kids to fetch their ukuleles and join him. Stupid Head popped the hood of his car and turned up his radio. My mother sat by the window louvres, white-knuckled and jaw clenched.   So we bought a set of bagpipes.   This morning, as the Teacher Guy sat by his car smacking a block of ice against the pavement at 5am, my mother woke with a wicked grin. She came downstairs, rubbing her hands in anticipation. The bagpipes will arrive any day, and then the neighbors will pay.      Oh yes, they will pay.
