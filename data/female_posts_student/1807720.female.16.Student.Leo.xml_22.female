I am still having some problems with Chem but I am working to understand it and I do understand it a bit better and well the test is on Thursay.  But well there is lots of pressure on myself to do good because I got 45% on my quiz and I know it is not the end of the world and it is just one thing but it is very important that I do good on the unit test.  Anyway Ryan won Canadian Idol tonight so I am so happy cause well even since Billy got voted out I have been cheering for Ryan even though Billy was always my number one favourite.  And well I had a math test today and I am not really sure how I did because I had a hard time with word problems like usual but I mean they are just hard and it's not like I can just snap my fingers and everything will be fine cause it don't work that way.  But yeah things seemed to be going a little bit better today and well I just hope it continues.
