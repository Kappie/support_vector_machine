I'm still happy that I didn't go to Michigan with them, even though I fell in to tears a few times because I wasn't there but it was for the best.  But the one thing I notice about being home alone is - Your more tempted to eat, whether your hungery or not. I never thought that would happen but this stupid head hunger thing is kicking my ass! It really must go away because its not welcome, ever!  Anyhow, I still haven't heard from Mr. Josh! It's going on 3 weeks now! I gotta admit that I miss chatting with him but now that my heart isn't so into him - I finally realize he wasn't as great as I was making him out to be.   Although, there was one downfall about my weekend - There's some balloon shape thing sticking out of my stomach. It looks totally gross and when you lean back, it pops out of my stomach and the fat just sorta falls down. This scares me and I don't go to the doctors until the 13th to find out what it is!  And on top of the whole stomach sticking out balloon thing - I will never eat chicken again or atleast not for a very long time! I spit up chicken/spit for 6 hours Sunday night THEN the next morning I couldn't keep anything down for hours. Ugh. I guess this was pay back for eating s'more crackers when I knew I shouldn't of even tried but I blame this on the whole cow chasing bull shit that happened.  Speaking of cow chasing - I wonder how many calories I burned doing that and stressing about them. Hmmm... The good thing about this is - My dad was calm about my yelling about it and actually AGREES that he should of left some food in the barn. And on a good note - I get a new pair of Liz  Me Jeans for taking care of them and not letting them wonder up to the main highway and cause alot of bull shit.  On that note - I shall go back to bed!  Life is goood! :-)
