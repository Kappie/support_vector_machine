I'm not actually in a bad mood, but I just felt like putting that, because I thought it would be a cool title.  Sometimes that is the only thing I have to hold on to though.  Ya know when your having a really, really bad day your only hope is that tommorow you can start fresh.  Sometimes for me though I get so bad that the only thing that helps me is to tell myself that life doesn't go on forever and I will die some day.  Don't get me wrong... I'm not suicidal or really depressed or anything.  It's just that when I'm in a really bad mood and having a really bad day it's comforting to think that it won't go on forever.  Well, I hope I didn't scare anybody with this post... that's definitely not what I meant to do.
