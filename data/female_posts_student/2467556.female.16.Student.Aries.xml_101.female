We were talking to Nathaniel and then he died or something.....then we talked to some david kid that sarah knows....and then he signed off and then we talked to other people i don't know.....but yeah then they all signed off too so here we are planning to make a music video and we're waiting for the camera to charge.  Hockey game was awesome.  We won 4-1.  Although our passing could've been a little better and Michael's stick was short....yeah it was funny.  We went partied after that at Boston's where i got free ice cream for my birthday from my fave and official waiter, Kenny.  We talked about how his gf totally embarassed him and he told us funny stories.  He said some pretty funny stuff that i have quoted.....see the profile for details.  Lol then we made up this thing called "Anti Dating Points", Sarah was the winner aka loser.  it was funny.  After we partied at Boston's, we went to Sarah's house to pick up her stuff.....Britty couldn't join us because she had to clean her room etc. *tear*  We got "drunk" in the new bathroom of Sarah's house with her mom while we swapped stories.  It was great. Then my brother and his friend hung out in the car while this happened.  So then we got back in the car and went home.  Sarah laid on my bed and fell in love with my star pillow......and decided to make it freak dance to songs on the radio.  We decided to make a movie about it but got distracted.  hey Nathaniel's talking again and he thinks me and Sarah are high/drunk.  go us, acheived life goal.    so the cam is probably charged now, and we can go.  If any of what we just wrote makes absolutely no sense.....its because we are so mentally drained from laughing at our stupidity that we can't think straight.  its like being high on life.  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  P.s- Sarah says we're high on hockey....the non stop hockey love
