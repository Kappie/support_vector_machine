It inspired me to make a list of the self-care tools I now feel like I have at my disposal, that I can use as needed during times of distress. So with no further ado... (and in no particular order)  1. Meditation- including techniques: metta, tonglen, shamatha-vipassana 2. Reiki Self-Healing 3. Yoga Sadhana: Svaroopa, Kripalu 4. Self-Massage incorporating yoga, thai yoga 5. Aromatherapy and 'aesthetic-atmospheric' healing. 6. Accessing Positive Healing States in the Body (Gestalt) 7. Nonviolent Communication (Marshall Rosenberg) 8. Write: journaling exercises, lists, essays, automatic writing... 9. Art: collage to focus, paint to center... 10. Yoga Nidra 11. Sauna (when available) 12. Whirlpool (when available) 13. Fasting (esp  urlLink Master Cleanser ) 14. Replenish energy thru nature- esp walking, taking pictures, laying in the sun. 15. Naptime
