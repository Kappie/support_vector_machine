They're only around for the summer.  Yea, so that was fun, except that Shane was to scared to jack the place mat for me!  Yea, then CISV, which was somewhat of a bust.  Should'a spent the night at Amy's.  That's always more fun than my house.  But hey, what are yea gunna do.  Off I go to watch a movie.  Not sure what one though.
