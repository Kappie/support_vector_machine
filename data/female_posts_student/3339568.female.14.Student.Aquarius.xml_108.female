White wine's alright, but I much prefer the lolly alochol drinks, like Bacardi. Loaded with alcohol, but don't taste much like it. Really sweet. Creamy's good too. I love cocktails. Don't like the strong stuff too much. Mi aunty bought me a margerita or a martini (can't remember which one), and the vodka in it blew me away. Strong taste of yucki vodka, then yummy aftertaste after. I didn't know if I liked it or not. Finished it though. Not too fond of vodka, hmmm...its alrite tho, not that bad. Maybe my alochol tastes will mature with time...
