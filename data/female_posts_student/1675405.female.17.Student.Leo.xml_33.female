       
      I honestly feel as if I'm stuck in this swirling oblivion, screaming, but no one hears me. I'm not going to point my fingers at the world, and pass it off as their fault, and not mine. It is mine. I'm too odd about certain things; I don't like faking friendship, and get upset when things begin to fall, I get hurt entirely too easily, and I hold grudges against those who have crushed my heart. But that's the thing! A smile is much more beautiful when it is follows a tear. I know I can make things better for myself, whether it be to just positively acknowledge what I have been gifted with. I'm a strong person more often than not, and I need to work things out within this twisting mind of mine, because, I'm not going to spill my problems on a friend and burden them with my own insecurities.
