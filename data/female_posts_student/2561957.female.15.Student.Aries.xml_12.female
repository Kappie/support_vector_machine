I hate explaining myself. For those of you in this world who actually give a fuck on what I have to say, this is about as good as you're gunna get. This is generally the only place I'll ever explain myself, unless you have quite a bit of standing with me.      It's Paul's friend Alex's birthday today. They got him Doom 3. Yes. Violence, testosterone, and video game. Does a 19-year-old guy need anything more in life? How about - no?      Oh! There's this guy in my 2nd period. I don't think he knows anyone in that class, because he sits by himself and just sleeps. Anyways, yesterday he didn't wake up at the bell when it rang and everyone was just going to leave him there. I felt bad for him, so I woke him up? Okay. So I find him uber-cute. That means nothing, right? Right.      Anywho, I don't know what to think about Paul anymore - right now. It's like... yes, but just kinda in the grey zone. It'd be so much easier if our relationship were black/white... Oh, well.       Even though I know, I don't want to know. Yeah, I guess I know. I just hate how it sounds.
