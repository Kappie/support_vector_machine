Okay, so Nan kinda gets fired (inevitably), and she goes back into the Xes' house seeking some closure (and possibly get more money).  Finally, after all readers (or at least after I) anticipate when Nan will tell Mrs. X off, she does it.  But into a recorder in one of Grayer's bears?   I dunno, kinda weak.  I wanted a full on face-to-face cat fight.  But even with that scenario, I don't know if I would have been satisfied either.  Anyways, also, what about Grayer?  Will he grow up to be a philanderer like his father?  Or, more crucial, will the fact that Nan left him totally destroy his childhood?  The last we see Grayer he is screaming for Nanny in the vacation "crap-house" (Mr. X).  I didn't feel closure with Grayer.  And then what about this new baby on the way?  Will the recorded message in Grayer's teddy bear affect Mrs. X, or more importantly, will she ever hear it?  And the book concludes with Nan naming her inherited dog Grace?  Great book, but bad ending.   By the way, I just got my senior portraits and they're horrible.   Like I've never taken such horrible pictures in my life.  Now keep in mind, they are the unairbrushed proofs.  I bravely picked the best one out of the bunch.  Brace yourselves...
