I did my chem lab, well what I understood of it but I can't answer the homework questions cause I don't understand what to do.  It is not that I don't want to do my homework, cause I always do homework.  But I feel kind of bad cause I can't really do it.  I think Matt is coming over tommorow and then he is gonna help me with math later cause I don't have a clue of what is going on and the math teacher didn't "teach" the unit so I am confused and she does not seem to understand that not everyone understands.  I think I have a religion project to do but I don't think I really want to work on that this weekend so I will probably do it next weekend as long as it is not due this week but I don't think it is or well if it is I am going to be one busy girl during the week.  Last night was Halloween like ya and it was funny cause my mom was like to some kid "Oh boy you sure look scary" and then he was like "but I am a dog" Lol...She thought he was an abominable snowman.  And then she was like "oh faith day was good" and then like in the night she is like "oh faith day is so boring, I don't like it"  like OMG I can't believe she would say that.  She does not realize how lucky she is cause she gets to go to that.  I can't wait til I am done University and I have a job teaching and then I will get to go.  And well yeah nothing too much this weekend.  I kept thinkin' bout the homework I need to finish but weekends end up being me trying to catch up on everything from the week and I don't ever seem to get a "real" break from things.
