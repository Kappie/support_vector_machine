Other than that I've been burning up because it's so hot and humid here. I haven't really slept for a couple of nights because of this, so I'm kinda grumpy...Anywo, if you're passing by and you have a lot of time on your hands check out: Autopilot Off (although I'm sure all of you know them already. There isn't really an emo following here in Vancouver, so I find all of this out myself.) Small towns burn a little slower, Amber Pacific, Fall Out Boy, and Jinxed. Well, I must go now!
