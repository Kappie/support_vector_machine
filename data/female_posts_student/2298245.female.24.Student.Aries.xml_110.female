I went to see  urlLink  The Cooler   this afternoon (yes, I was at a movie at 4:30 on a Thursday afternoon - as one reader of this blog  urlLink commented once , and her blog can be found  urlLink here  as well as in the links at the side denoted Crossing the Rubicon, this really is the best time of my life), and none other than Mr. Mike Wallace was in the audience.  So my friend is the one who notices him first, so she looks over and tells me, so I glance over all casual and stuff and I see that it really is him.  Except, in some strange way, it doesn't look like him.  And I can't figure out why.  But there's this nagging thought in the back of my head, like he should be taller or he should look different.  Then, it hits me:  I've seen  urlLink  The Insider   so many times that whenever I think of Mike Wallace, I picture  urlLink Christopher Plummer , who plays him in the movie.  Just goes to show, that sometimes movies can become reality in your head, until reality smacks you on the head, that is.  Anyway,  The Cooler  was good.  I really liked it.  Never been a huge Alec Baldwin fan, though he is great in  Glengarry Glen Ross .  But I'd say he gave one of the better performances I've ever seen him give, as well as one of the best of the year.  And William H. Macy is great, but he's always great, and I usually like him, so that was less of a surprise.  I highly recommend it.
