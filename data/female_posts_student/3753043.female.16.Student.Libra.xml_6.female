But last night I was playing Prince of Persia in my room and suddenly the screen turned off even tho the tv was still on [it was weird >_ My little child brother is pestering me to get off.. Little bastard thing *shakes fist*  Oh and yes...   urlLink          urlLink Which Jhonen Vaquez character are you?  By  urlLink EmReznor .
