Or something.  Friday, Massachusetts decided to be unbearably cold, trying to give us all frostbite. Almost every single school in the state was closed, but considering the fact that the highschool was the only one in the town open in the first place, we had to suck it up and go anyway. I took my A and C period exams and went home. Shaina came with me, and we hung out at my house for a while, which was awesome because I haven't really had a chance to just hang out with her in forever. I wanted to go out that night, but didn't have a ride or a destination, so I stayed home.  Saturday's morning and afternoon were both pretty boring. I just sat around, took a shower, talked to people, and oh yeah...one of my best friends decided he hates me. I don't know, he said some things that really made me think that he was just expressing what everyone else thought and was afraid to say. Some of my friends disagree with him. I really have no idea what to think. I dunno, but it hurt me to find out that he felt that way. I guess I have to try harder, and I will.  Saturday Night: I'll admit that I actually wanted to go to the Linkin Park concert, and probably would have if it wasn't sold out. I don't regret not going, though. All That Reamins and a couple other bands opened for Helloween, this English heavy metal band from the 80's. The show was at the Worcester Palladium, and I went with Catie. We got there a little late, and they made Catie take her jacket off cause it had spikes in the hood, so we missed the first band, but it was cool. We met some of my big brothers friends there. I talked to Pat for a while, but the other guys literally jumped straight into the mosh pit the second they got there, and disappeared after that. We saw Blistered Earth, and I thought they were really good. They did a good job getting a reaction outta the audience, considering most of the crowd hadn't shown up yet, and people were still just getting into the show. All That Remains was up after that. I always enjoy their performances, and I know other people did too. They've got some really good stuff, and are all really talented guys. They're goin' places. I still dunno what's going on with Matt :\, I didn't even talk to him last night.  Anyway, this crazy Helloween band was amazing! I loved them, and next time they come around here, I'm definitely going to see them. They were so awesome. Without a doubt- and Catie agrees- best concert I've been to all year. The guys were hilarious onstage; they were all complete characters. There was one guitarist with an ashtray attatched to his mic stand and just smoked and rolled his eyes the whole time. He looked real comfortable up there in his leather pants. The drummer had some crazy mohawk thing goin on, and went completely insane up there, the poor drums. The bassist had long, crazy, curly, layered 80's hair and had so much energy, he seemed inhuman. The lead singer was hilarious, comparing the audiences energy to his boner. He had this awesome voice, and was so....how do I say this....odd....onstage. It was perfect. Then there was the gorgeous guitarist who was smiling the ENTIRE time. Oh boy.  Anyway, it was fun, and the crowd cracked me up. They were all either my favorite people; psychotic teenage metalheads, or older helloween fanatics. There was this one guy who looked like he was in his late forties moshing with the younger guys, and he had to be drunker than anyone I've ever seen. Hilarious. Great night.  Of course,this morning completely sucked, but I won't get into details. I'll get over it. I hope.  Blah.
