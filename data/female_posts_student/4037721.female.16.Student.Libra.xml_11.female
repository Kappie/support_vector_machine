I aslo added some more finishing touches to her painting today (still not happy with it yet though) and I don't know what she will think of it. For me it is a symbolism of her and thats why I liked to paint it so much, because it reminded me of her with every stroke. Actually I don't think I ever stop thinking of her, I never find my self suddenly thinking of her, I find myself thinking of her all the time.  The only other thing that happened today was that Saya rang me to ask if I was going swimming tomorrow with her and Kyra and told me that her Mum was picking me up with her and taking us to Kyra's and then taking us onto Hitchin swimming pool. Otherwise I spent most of the day catching up on stuff I had missed. Oh and I also ordered a new PS2 game with my new visa electron card which I can use on some websites and in some stores, instead of carrying cash around all the time. See ya for now.
