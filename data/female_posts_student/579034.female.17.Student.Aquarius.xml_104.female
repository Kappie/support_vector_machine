I like it though, it's more manageable now. I don't think Mick will like it very much, he said he liked my hair long. I'll post a picture tommorw, my camera takes pictures better when it's not dark out. Damn cheap thing. So then, I went to the mall and I went shopping. I bought a pair of shoes and I ended up not liking them so I'm gonna return them and get Mick a birthday gift w/ the money. He wants a jersey that they have so I'll just grab it. I also went into Abercrombie and had fun. I could have had more fun but the mall crowd was picking up and I still had more to do so I wanted to get out of there. I love going to the mall to shop when it's empty. It makes it easier to shop and stuff. So then I got makeup in Sephora with the gift card Deb got me and I got new clips in Essentials. Oh, and I got Lee Ann a nice gift from Guess so, I guess you can say I had a productive day. Then I came home and modeld for myself. It was fun. I love doing that as gay as it sounds. I put the best outfits together and and I just have a grand old time. Okay, stop laughin, I had nothing better to do with my time. Then later Joe came over for dinner with his poodle... yes, my mothers boyfriend has a poodle. He made me try lentals even when I told him I hated them (my mom used to force feed it to me... I guess im tramatized)... and surprise, surprise... I still hate them. Then I just randomly decided to go to Barns and Noble. I called up Erica and Melanie and Erica wasn't allowed to go so me and Melly went. It was fun. I found some good books on Notre Dame Football and stuff. Then, me and Melly talked about stuff and read Cosmo. And when we went to get coffee the guy thought I said "Cappuchino" instead of "Frappuchino". His bad.  That's  always an adventure. I always close that feeling so educated. And now I'm home again. Nothing really too eventful but still a day worth blogging. I wish I had something more interesting to put on here rather then just me tellin you what I did. That's why you all need to read   urlLink Writers Revolution   cause these Canadians rock the Casba. Okay, I'm out. Much love. x0x
