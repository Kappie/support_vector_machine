I am still going out with Brenden and to make things all the better my mom talked to Nan today and found out that i was going out with Brenden which i had not told her as of yet. O well she made me relize that i am not only hurting Jake but i am hurting Brenden and Kristelle which I really don't care about Kristelle but i do care about Jake and Brenden. All I know is that i want Jake back and i just can't bring myself to break up with Brenden. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. Maybe so i don't hurt anyone else i will just hurt myself. I would rather do that then hurt some one else.  On a happier note I give thanks to two of my friends, Dean-O and Kim. They kept me from killing myself. They were there for me when i needed them and i relized that people really do care about me. I saw Dean-O today at our performance and he gave me a hug and just told me that i will be ok. He is such a great help to me. Kim tells me that I will live. I need to hear that sumtimes. They are both such great helps to me. Heather and others help me to i just hope they noe that.  I tryed talking to Jessie about this hole thing today. She just told me that being 15 engaged and trying to kill myself is stupid and she won't standby and just watch one of her friends kill themselfs. She hung up on me. I feel awful but I guess wut ever she thinks is wut she thinks. I know i just want my Jacob back.  peace out,
