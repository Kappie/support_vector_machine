Nick: They're not my teeth, actually.  Jessica: Oh, I forgot. They're 'ventures.' No, that's dentures.  Nick: Ventures?  Jessice: What are they called?  (Nick laughs)  Jessica: Veneers.  (Nick laughs)  Jessica: I thought 'dentures' and I thought 'veneers.' And then I came up with 'ventures.'  Nick: Yeah. "Think" is the key word.   now you know that if anybody can empathize with jessica simpson, it's got to be me, for sures. the girl may not have a clue when it comes to...well, just about anything, but she's definitely got an acute sense of fashion (okay, maybe having a sizeable bank account doesn't hurt either). feeling particularly inspired after watching the show, i,for one, have decided to battle the pangs of pms this month by hitting up ebay instead of the cookie jar. it's a lot more productive this way, i think. i'm currently making my premiere bids on jessica's beautiful crochet shawl and vintage scarf. this ebay thing is not nearly as complicated as i thought... it's like i've discovered a whole new world. oh my gaw. anyway, only about 18 hours to go for one of the items, and it'll be mine, all mine!! my alarm clock's set so i'll be ready to roll. eeeeeeeee, this is so exciting, wish me luck guys!!   currently playing:  urlLink jessica simpson - with you
