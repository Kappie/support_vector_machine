Oh yeah if you get lost Sunday just as for the Breakfast Club, we're upstairs. Zabeth..if you noticed i hung up rather quickly....that's becuase I was helping my mom cook and she was giving me evil looks and telling me to get off the phone, I'll call you as soon as I get i chance, smile (don't hurt me) life sucks but it'll get better...guys suck but there are some good ones...kinda Will..the essays are online, you just have to search for them like on dogpile.com, if you do that you'll get like tons sites where you can print it off. Liz...hope ur mom is better and if you ever get around to planning that study thing tell me. I'll help plan but we acutally have to form this so that we work and stuff. I leave on the 18th and get back on the 25..but i don't know how we'll do that since we're like taking 2 days to get there and they've only planned 1 day to get back...maybe we'll get back at 11:59pm....who knows Abby....Congrats!...i really really really want to know you better...really! and me and Josh have an...interesting relationship..i think all you've heard me say about him is mean but I promise I luv him to death in a completely sisterly way. If you EVER doubt that call me up and tell me...I'm not paranoid (maybe a little) about that but like....one of my better friends had a gf that thought he and I were too close to be just friends...i promise we were just that, friends..also I hope the best for you two....you're the only one that I've seen that hasn't completely screwed him over in the fact that he's not self-destructing...thank you Scott...don't know you but welcome...i've heard some nice things about you and I hope that my friends don't frighten you...or rather that I don't. I'm kinda the brain of all these peeps...though they're all smart..but I'm usually sane but I insane little episodes.. Will's...the other brain that just is history this history that, Zabeth is the writer and Linds is the peacemaker and Abby is the darling and Josh...is...well Josh.  Anyway gtg peeps but Smile...life's great *ducks* Rosie
