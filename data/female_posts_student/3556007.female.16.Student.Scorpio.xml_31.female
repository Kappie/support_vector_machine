But then later, when iI was in side the house, they turned into Hunter from next door and some other kids. At one point, while we were inside the hosue, Hunter was washing his hands and he opened up the front of the sink and just went and sat in there! He was gettin gall wet. Then I yelled at him and i was pretty harsh and I felt bad... Later when he was going over there or maybe it was right before this incident, I thought that he was going for this one chocolate bar that was sitting on top of the counter, so I yelled at him. Then a bit later we all went outside. Theere was ome other fat lady who was taking care of the kids during the day but I just had to care for them at night. Well, when we went outside, there were lots of people buzzing around, so I went through the large gate taht we had to go through and I wakled a bit until I came to a bench and sat down. THis is when I saw some of the 8th graders like this one really tall Olivia, and a few others that I don't remember. Well I was sitting there for a bit, and when they came, they had to go around the crows to the outside of this one little fence that was perced on the side of this (we were at the top on some sort of plateau) hill. And I watched teh 8th grade girls do it and I was really worried about them. Meanwhile while I was sitting on the bench, I just realized that Brian was next to me and Ellen was sitting on the dirt floor in front of me. I realized that he was there while I was talking with Ellen, so I started leaning up against him and she started to roll her eyes. Even though I was distracted, I was able to continue teh conversation with Ellen. THen for some reason we all had to move. We went inside thsi room because we were going to watch a movie with a bunhc of other people. While we were going, Brian was a book and I was carrying him. ??? But, when we got to the room, a bucn h of people were there and pastor mike was there an he gave me a really weird look.   Oh, earlier ~ I was inside some sort of windowed area and Brian and his family was walking on the other side.
