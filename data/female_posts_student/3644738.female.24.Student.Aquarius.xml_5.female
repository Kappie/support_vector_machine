When you boil the show down to its essence, they are just a bunch of women looking for love but making life complicated for themselves...@ times we can be our own worst enemy.  It's like those women who say they want an unpredictable, spontaneous and exciting man and get pissed when he isn't at home waiting for their call...Some of us don't really know what we want or more importantly don't appreciate what we've got....I believe that human beings have been conditioned to believe that the grass is always greener on the other side and I guess the show reflects that fact very well.
