Our friends had ditched us so we tried to find somewhere else to sit.  After that everything got screwed up.  I was running down a hall trying to get away from someone.  I was looking for one of my friends (no one I know).  I found her in a costume room, and she stared to show me all of the things she had made.  I tried to get her to be quiet so this person wouldn't find me.  All of a sudden the person I was running from jumped out in front of my  hiding place.  We started fighting each other with giant clever looking things.  I ended up stabbing her with a sword (I have no idea how to I got the sword).  So my friend and I were gonna try to get away, but then just as we were about to run out of the room this other person showed up.  This person was either a robot that was supposed to look like the person chasing me, the twin, or a clone.  Well the person called for help because we'd be found.  My friend and I had just enough time to get through a door and run down a few flights of stairs.  I was getting really scared cause I could hear the people behind us.  I looked down the stairs and saw a doctors office kinda thing where they do evil experiments on people.    Then I woke up. It was all very aliasish.  If anyone wants to take a stab at what the dream might mean I'd love to hear it.  My version is I'm running away from someone because I'm scared (duh), and I try to get away but they'll always show up trying to catch me. That's about all that I have so far so...   Moving on, I went to see The Day After Tomorrow last night.  Very good movie by the way.  I really want to study meteorology or something like that in college, but that won't happen sadly.  I gave Andrew his birthday present last night.  I got him fuzzy dice for his car he just got and gift cards to eat and see a movie.  That's why we went to the movie because he could actually afford to go do something.  The one bad thing about the movie was that I really felt like I was a part of it.  I haven't decided if it was because the movie was just that could or because it was just that cold.  That's about it except I went by Poor Richards to see about an intership, and it's looking good for me.
