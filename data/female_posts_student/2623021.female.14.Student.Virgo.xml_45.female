I wanted to go home really badly about a week ago, but I've been hanging out with Michaela a lot. Meeting new people.. a lot of guys, really cute guys. I have to decide by Friday whether I want to stay or whether I want to go. I went downtown last night and hung out with everyone. Met some new people; Stacy (who reminds me soo much of Arianna) Beef, Helms, Chelsey, Aaron, Travis, I saw Chad again.. hmm there were like 5 others girls and 4 other guys that I don't remember their names... but yeah. It was a lot of fun like always. I went skiing and wakeboarding with Michaela's mother, her bfChris, my mom, Shannon, (her sister) and her cousin John... Michaela was sick. John is 16 and Shannon is 24 and it was John and my first time skiing/wakeboarding. Wow it was very intertaining.  "OH SHIT"  haha. I want to stay really badly, but if there was any possibility back in Florence... I would be there in a second. I don't know why, but I just want that alot. Felicia, Suzy, Tori, and Katrina told me that theywant me to come back, Jennifer thinks I should leave on like the 22nd. I'm not sure what I am going to do... I might come back onm the 10th.. I truely have no idea what's going to happen, let's see what we can make happen ^^. Well I g2g Ciao
