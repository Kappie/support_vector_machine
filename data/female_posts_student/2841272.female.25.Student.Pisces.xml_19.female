It is a difficult topic, with all the great performances in the role of the villain, I am not going to rank them. I am going to give my opinion's on the five greatest villains in the history of the cinema. But first, I will air some grievances I have with your post.  I will start with your choice for #2, Hannibal Lector. As you said in your post the AFI named him the greatest villain of all-time, which just on general principle keeps him off my list. I'll concede that Anthony Hopkins was terrifying in the role, possibly the best performance of his career. But he is 60 years old and locked up, therefore, not on my list.   Now you did hit a bullseye with your pick for #3, Darth Vader. For those of you who don't know, I am a huge fan of the  Star Wars  movies. I am one of those fans that got in line 23 hours before tickets went on sale for  Episode I . I have always felt that the two most important characters in the  Star Wars  movies are Han Solo and Darth Vader. Han Solo because he was reluctant to join the rebellion, but once he did, he embodied it. Darth Vader because, like you said, he is an iconic image of pure evil. And that, is what makes him a great villain(he will not be appearing on my list because I feel he is above any list).  She may be one of the greatest female villains of all-time, but greatest villains, come on! Michelle Pfiefer's portrayal of Catwoman was a great performance, but Catwoman was a villain that often flirted with the idea of becoming a good guy. Yes she is sexy, she is seductive, and maybe a little unpredictable, but she lacks that "shiver down your spine" quality that defines a great villain. But the thing is, you mentioned one of the greatest villains in your Catwoman paragraph. Jack Nicholson as The Joker.  The original  Batman  was by the best comic book adaptation ever(I apologize to all you  Spiderman  fans, it's a close second), and that is due in no small part to the man we have simply come to know as...Jack. The idea of The Joker is a little weak, a little 1970's, but Nicholson turned that weak idea into a bad guy that we cannot take are eyes off of. He stole the show, everytime he was on the screen he shined. The conflict between The Joker and Batman had history. The Joker had killed Bruce Wayne's parents in front of him, when Bruce was just a little boy, and he only remembered one thing about the incident. He remembered something the killer said, one of the greatest single lines in the history of movies, "have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?". One man, one voice, could truly make that line work, Jack is that man, Jack is that voice.  The second evildoer, and last of this post, is a little less celebrated than all the others we have talked about, but is just as fearsome. Castor Troy( Face/Off ) is still to this day one of the most interesting roles ever. Played by both Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, Castor incorporated a conscience-less killer with an astonishing intellect. He was the true equal of his protagonist counterpart Sean Archer(also played by both cage and Travolta). Troy and Archer knew each other so well that they seemed to switch off being one step ahead of each other. One of the things that seems to be lacking in most action movies is emotion, Travolta and Cage brought a phenomenal amount of emotion to this movie. Most villains lack emotion, but in this movie when Castor's brother, Pollacks, is killed by Archer, it seems to fuel the hatred the Castor has for our hero. In my opinion Castor Troy is one of the most underrated villains of cinema.   So there you have it, two of my five, there are three more on the way so stay tuned. As for guessing who your number one is, Daniel Day Lewis as Bill "The Butcher" Poole in Gangs of New York.
