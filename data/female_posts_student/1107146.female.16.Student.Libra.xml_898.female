I have a guy here that just read that post (parts of it) and he said the exact same thing to me 2 days ago. I have to figure this out by myself. I have to know for sure that he's what I need and want in my life. I figured out here that I really don't need Phil to survive. I've found my circle of friends here and I'm comfortable. Yes I call him but the past 2 days I haven't thought of him...which is strange for me. I have to decide Josh but for right now I'm going to enjoy Knoxville. I love the people here and I love the environment. I'm not going to worry about what happens in B-wood for 3 more wks. I love you all but for me it's knoxville now. You've all told me to live...well I am. I'm going to stay connected to you but for a month Phil and I will seriously keep in on the DL. We've decided no matter what we'll stay friends and above everything else is friendship...number one forever. That's how it is now. Thanks for loving me but you know most of all I call the last one. I know I don't have a huge choice but I choose time. I choose GSS for the month. Love you.
