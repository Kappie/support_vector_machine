At first I was like "i wont miss 'em..they are just a pair of shoes" But when I saw Sara wearing 'em I  was like "THOSE SHOULD BE ON MY FEET!"   Oh well..I will get 'em back tomorrow. I think I can survive..I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.  School was kinda blllehhh. We didi absolutely NOTHING!  In scieence we got to make shapes out of straws which was kinda fun, have I ever told you how much I love straws? Well...I don't tell many people a lot about me. You may think..UH OH! Mid sentence...must go empty the dishwasher..don't worry- I will be back!
