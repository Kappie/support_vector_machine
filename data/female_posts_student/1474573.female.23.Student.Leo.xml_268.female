Squirrels that are mating (I think...)  4. Loose cats in the neighborhood that like to chase the birds.  (I would rather it be a dog, though...I much prefer dogs.)  5. Nosey neighbors  from two doors down and across the street  coming to see what you've done to the backyard and give their suggestions as to how we could have done it better.  Oh, although he used the excuse for coming over as him needing to drop something off, which he did, but why did he have to come through the back?  Why not, gee, I dunno...RING THE DOORBELL??  It freaked the shit outta me!!  I thought, oh here it comes, someone's coming to kill us on Easter Sunday and everyone is at church except for us heathens, so no one will hear our screams... oh, wait...its just Gary.  Anyway, on that note...Easter Sunday was good.  I got to see my cutie patootie niece who is just absolutely gorgeous.  I cant tell you how delicious she is!!  Even with boogers running out of her nose and yogurt all over her face, she's STILL cute.  Had dinner with Steve's family and as per usual got stuck in crazy traffic out there.  But all was well in Rau-land, and that's all that matters.  Today is Opening Day at Shea Stadium and Steve and a bunch of other pals and family are going to the game.  Which means I have to fend for myself without the car.    Shit, and I was sooo looking forward to going home at lunchtime and checking out Episode 37 of  Sex and the City  on On Demand.  I'm now up to watching Season 3, where Carrie starts dating Aidan and then starts cheating on him with Big, and Charlotte meets Trey and Miranda and Steve break up and Samanta moves to the Meat Packing Disctrict.  I cant say how much I love this show, and its even better when you dont have to wait a whole week for the next episode!  Lovely, aint it?
