On May 1, I'll be taking the SATIIs for writing, literature and US history. Let's start with that one: I just took a practice test for lit. (insert test score here). I'm not going to settle with that, but it also means changing a mindset somehow and practicing over and over again. I'll have to visit the library. I'm hoping writing will be halfway decent, and history directly depends on how much I take the AP to heart. It's just lit that's bothering me right now. Anything above a (score), I'll be thrilled. Above (score), ok. Anything below, I've screwed some mechanism up. I'm sure this sounds strange or unreasonable to some people, but I can say honestly that these are my goals, and not achieving them (i.e. a (score)) tells me I have a lot more work to do.  And that's just hurdle number one. Then there's also Bach Regionals, which rests basically on my ability to calm down and execute a simple prelude and fugue flawlessly. I need to watch my practice time (more) and curb performance anxiety.  Followed by two weeks of APs. Bio is going to need quite some work, especially when I just decided to give up on RESPIRATION. I'm sure all of you are laughing by now. Respiration. And not even to the Krebs cycle yet, just glycolysis. Spanish is just a matter of luck, maybe. I don't know what to think about it. I think it's difficult for everybody, and I just don't know where the curve is. Or how mediocre I can afford to be to still get a 5.  If it looks like it's going to get bad, AIM's going to go. I'm hesitant to delete it altogether, but I really can't click on that stupid yellow man. I'll start blocking people just to keep my mind on track, maybe. So there, Ellis is blocked.   I can sense that this is simply the beginning of something much greater than I am, that in the next few weeks it'll be mental exercise and exertion like no other. This, probably, is more junior year than anything. It just makes you shiver because you know you're just about to go over the top, you see it coming and you feel yourself slowing down and hanging at equilibrium before the plunge. I'm shivering already.  Maybe I shouldn't go to the hospital tomorrow. It's going to be my second week in a row missing, but I also can't afford to hand over four hours of my time on one night. But I need some way to make sure that yes, I'll skip hospital and yes, I'll study.   TUESDAY'S PLAN OF ATTACK:  skip Los Robles visit the library instead for more SATII lit practice catch up on Bailey chapters, make notecards if I'm daring enough read more Princeton cover at least two more chapters in bio, preferably more Hemingway reading, separation of thematic periods for English AP talk to Battaglia and/or Freeman about studying  Game face.
