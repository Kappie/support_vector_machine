It's a car that can fly, float on water, but just as easily do the things that regular cars do. Her love life is presently in a traffic jam, while mine...well...mine...was driving along smoothly and began to fly, but abruptly landed, the it sorta went along a daredevil, twisty road, before deciding it was going to ditch that life and run up a hill adn try to fly. So it acted like peter pan and thought a happy thought and went for it, but right in mid-air it took out the parachute and flew down in the saftey of a traffic jam. Then deciding that it got bored it flew off a cliff, did not fly, but instead found itself blowing up and now the driver (a.k.a. me) is floating in the middle of the ocean...lol...yes..i know i relate my life to children's movies but what are you gonna do? *sigh* presently a chitty chitty bang bang that is not mine has found me in the middle of the ocean and i am presently deciding whether or not i want to grab hold or let it pass...at any rate...whats the point of getting together with someone??? As quoted from  When Harry Met Sally  "You had someone to be with, to go places with, you had a date on national holiday's..." BLEH.
