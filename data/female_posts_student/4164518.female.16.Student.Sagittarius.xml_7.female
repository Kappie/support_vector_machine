I went to buy some cigarettes and lost about a stone in sweat, its horrid. i'm also rather hacked off, nothing to do, no one around, and everyone else is in a bad mood which doesn't really help. I feel like going to a gig of some sort, but there isn't anyone decent on. Been invited to one tomorrow, but not sure if I'l go or not, I don't even know the guy.  This sites a whole lot better than live journal, better features etc. And your pictures don't have to be the size of a sucidial girls ego.   This blog will last about a week, then I'll get bored and create something else, sorry to anyone who finds this the slightest bit interesting. It would be nice to get a comment, cause so far i haven't looked at anyone elses blog/profile. the truth is I don't know how, ha! And I'm predicted A* in I.T...  I'm going to go waste some time doing something else now.
