Yesterday I stayed at the school and then got supper and then had to be in the Drama studio for 6:00 pm to do a rehearsal of our scences we were showing for the open house.  Then we performed from 7:00 and went past 8:30.  I didn't get home until after 9:00 pm.  I was so afraid I wouldn't remember the Bio I studied.  I think the quiz was ok today, but there was something that I just totally could not remember no matter how hard I tried.  It was even part of the topic that *I* researched.  Doesn't make very much sense does it!!  I also made a mistake with the last question on the front side.  I put that animals absorb water through cellular respiration.  Oh boy Vanessa, that's like not even close!! LOL.  I guess I can't change the fact that I made a stupid mistake like that, so I guess I will just laugh about it.  I have sooooo much to do this weekend though.  I have that Bio project, which is alright and not that bad but I also have an essay to write for English.  She isn't even giving us the question for it until tomorrow.  Also tomorrow after school I have a model UN meeting and then I 'm meeting up for Megz party and we are going for pizza after.  Then on Saturday and Sunday I will be at the university all day!  I'm going to be a busy busy gal!  No rest for me!  Broomball today was really fun.  Active Living is fun!  I'm glad I switched Physics for it.  It is such a nice break from hard work and everything.  It's nice to just have some fun.  Of course Drama is fun too!  And good news, no great news, no EXCELLENT NEWS!   ...I MADE THE AUDITION CUT FOR A MID SUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM!   ...And I got Cobweb as my part  ...It's nothing major, but I feel good just to have a part and actually be chosen  ...This semester kicks @$$!  ...And did I mention I love life right now?!?
