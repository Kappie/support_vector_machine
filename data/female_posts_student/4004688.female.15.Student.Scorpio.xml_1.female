I'm on the com today cuz my tv busted (it might be cuz they cut the cable cuzwere moving in like 3 days: so *poof* no more cable), and so without television one must resort to the computer.   anyways withthat little introduction out of the way, let us proceedto more important things. The factthat life is really a whole bunch of sour candies, i mean sometimes its really too much andat times its nice and enjoyable. some ppl are allergic to living out their life (so ucould say they hate sour candies) and others just try to make the best out of it.  i remember once i ate awhole bunch of those super sour cherries candies and the day after my tongue felt really weird and then during gym class ifelt like a piece of skin hanging off my tongueand im likeshowing my gym teacher (''miss is there something on my tongue'') and she was like ''ewwww wat did u do?! i think u should go see the nurse!'' turns out i had burnt the taste buds on the top of my tongue because of thesour-ness of the candies ( and thequantity i ate) and the skin had turned white and was peeling off, needless to say it wastotally gross and really not enjoyable(and the moral of thisstory is,''dont eat too many sour candiesat one time.'' OR ''the point of life is too take it in, not to drown in it'' -in otherwords take it slow, live it one day at a time and dont overload urself-).   S'all for now dudes and dudettes  have nice day
