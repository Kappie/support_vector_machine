It makes me feel whole, just as much as empty,  Happy, just as much as sad,  And, loved just as much as lonely.    As I pick up the scattered memories,  I feel as though I am picking up  Pieces of my heart.   I smell them, feel them,  Touch them, and remember them.    When I put them together,  I feel as though as I am constructing a mold of my heart,  Replacing each piece of the frame.   Every time I open the box,  The frame gets stronger and less fragile.    It makes me smile to know that  At one time I was loved and that I loved.   Many pieces remind me of the pain you gave me,  But with sorrow and grief... comes power and triumph  And I feel as though I have won.    You may have broke my heart  But you taught me something;  If you love someone, really really love them,  Love will give you the strength to let them go.
