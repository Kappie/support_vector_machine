But they're in town while I'm still here...we'll see.   Am worried about Cam. I hope he's okay. I'll call him in a little while, no, I'll send him a text message. I don't want his phone ringing while he's at work. My mom made me feel a little better about it.   If you're all wondering what the hell it is, you can ask him if you know him, 'cuz you're not getting it out of me.  Back to work I suppose.   //sings in my head, "my heart is breaking in front of me..."
