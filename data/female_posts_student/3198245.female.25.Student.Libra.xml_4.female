Having an allowance...getting to eat anytime of the day...taking naps between classes...and most of all, having your friends around you. Yeah, school is full of shit and lots of work, but at least your suffering with your friends.  I have seven weeks of practicum to go... well, maybe six if I can wheedle out of it so I can get some sort of vacation before school starts.  I'm also looking forward tormenting the freshmen next year. Bwahaha!
