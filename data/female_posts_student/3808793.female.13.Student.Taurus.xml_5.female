I'm currently packing, and it's taking forever. I keep thinking I've forgotten something, or have to hide something, or get rid of the stuff under my bed.. >_  In other news, I got my hair cut short. Yaaaay. It's a helluva lot easier to take care of, and I can take 3 minute showers now- no double shampooing required, just lather-rinse-exit. Excellent. Unfortunately, I have to get my hair cut quite often, because if it gets much longer than it is it'll look bad.  The best part is I don't have to worry about it anymore. I can pretend I'm at a Pantera concert, sweep it out of my eyes, and it still looks fine. I hardly have to brush it, or make sure short hair is tucked behind my ears. Currently, I'm just enjoying headbanging randomly and not having to lunge for a brush.  See also: Mohitos are tasty. I don't know exactly what's in it, but something like  Limeade Mint Ice Seltzer  Normally there'd be rum in it, but I'm underage. It's pretty good, try it.  Oh yeah, happy July 4th and all that. Yadda yadda yay go america fireworks hot dogs blahblah have fun. :D  On that note, I'm off to continue packing. So many socks to fold...SO MANY SOCKS... >:|
