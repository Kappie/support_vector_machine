Only Miss Q can pack two-hours' worth of reading material into 13 pages and have the reader nodding her head resolutely at the end.   Guess there won't be as much yoga tonight, but by god, there will be Harry Potter reading!  And I have to take down the Morpheus result from the Greek God quiz.  Can't have it mucking up my side-bar, sorry.
