I call them these names because two ancient stories/maxims explain perfectly what they are:  "Try not to think of blue elephants" What happens if you do?  You think of blue elephants, of course. Now, I'm not exactly sure why the mind works this way- God works in mysterious ways, as they say- but it's damn annoying. Especially when you're trying not think of something! This comes up most often in worry. When you worry about something, you try not to think about it. Then the 'elephant' algorithmn kicks in and you immedietely think about it. Lather, rinse, repeat- go insane!  Let's say the entire world, or the life of your most loved ones, depended on you not thinking a certain thought. Let's say some telepathic nutball would harm them only if you thought about a purple balloon. What do you think would happen? Oh, you'd try your best- for certain- but you'd fail every time. No matter what the stakes, it seems like the mind just doesn't care. Its contrarity extends to homocidal and even suicidal levels.   What does this tell us about the mind? The other story is:  "One time, an ant asked a catepillar how it was that he was able to move all those legs in perfect synergy. The catepillar said, 'Hmm, let me think about it...'- and he never walked again."  When we think about how we do something, we get all mixed up. What at first seems easy on an intuitive basis become speciously difficult when we try to reason it out into thinking. This seems like a related concept to our mind's contrarity; but it's not clear exactly how.   So again, what does this tell us about the mind? Firstly, it tells us the mind cares very little for what we want; in fact, it's more interested in what we don't want. In fact, the mind doesn't even care what's good for itself; it's contrarity will easily descend into self-destructive actions.   One is tempted to consider the classical Chinese belief that a person hasn't one soul, but many; seven 'bo' souls and three 'hun' souls. They both do everything possible to escape the body, according to traditional myth; but while the hun only act fairly, the bo souls actually act in interests of self-sabotage, and do everything possible to frustrate the life and progress of a human being.   But perhaps we are at risk of becoming too mystical here; the simple fact is that while part of our mind seems to do what we want, other parts do the exact opposite.   I imagine insane asylums are full of people who took their mind too seriously. I can't prove this scientifically, but I suspect there have been many tortured souls assailed by the contrarity of their own mind who were eventually driven mad by it. For anyone whose ever had any experience with mental contrarity, it's certainly imaginable.   So then, what is the solution?   Try not to try.   What does that mean? It sounds all Zennish and self-contradictory. But it's true, nontheless- if one wants the mind to cease being all contrary and making you nutty, evidently you have to do something. And yet, every attempt at doing something will be rebuffed by the contrarity of the mind.   Therefore, the only solution is to do nothing. To try not to try. To neither attempt to impose one's will on the mind nor to co-operate with it.   More later. -Ian
