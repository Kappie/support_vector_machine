I could read his poetry and his proses for the rest of my life and never have to worry about eating or sleeping again. His poetry gives me such an energy, and keeps me coming back for more. He has given me permission to post the below, and I encourgae you to check out his blog to read more and see the amazing photographs he has taken... urlLink airspaced.        Black Eyes    When I'm coming home I'm being watched  A thousand tiny glass lines wind the road  Through a phantom hole in the city night  Black eyes wathcing me    Follow me, follow me  Then we'll see, then we'll see    When teh pale face of the barren moon  Turns to burn the inverted day  I can't feel it in the same way as   Black eyes wathcing me    Why should't we why should we?  Why don't we why don't we?    Whne I'm exhausted from the burden  I struggle to accept my birth  I'll curse the sky and curse the earth   Black eyes watching me     Take it in, take it it  They'll begin, they'll dig in    When I'm down to my last stand  And I've finally given all I can   When defeat is all I have  When I know they've driven me mad  I'll turn my head and look up high  Turn me black eyes to the sky  However pale, every time  Black eyes watching me.       Sirens    The organs that are joined in me create a sound. I can hear it as I try to sleep at night. Beyond the simplicity of the heartbeat, I can hear each part of my body performing its function. But not like you might imagine, the crude squelching noises one can hear when they press their heads against a lover's stomach in those moments such people share. I can hear a hum. An audible hum. Whilst it is very quiet, I can make it out if I concentrate long enough. And it's not just a single hum, like a fridge or a microwave or a white noise, but different frequencies creating a harmonic sound. Almost like guitar feedback, but so quiet and harmonious... almost like running a damp finger around the rim of a wineglass. Each part of my body has slightly more or slightly less water, but these other-wordly sounds fit together regardless of their actual frequency. They just fit. When I am well, I can feel these notes resonating in every cavity of my body, up my bones and my spine and into the base of my brain. They form a chord, a harmonic sound that soothes me to sleep. I imagine the things making sounds as small glass orbs, suspended within some dark space within my chest, rotating slowly and making their song gently and peacfully. And when I hear this noise I think it is the sound of my soul deep inside of me, soothing me to sleep.    And when I am low I can't hear a thing.
