One this is for sure, homework and  CUBING  (that is what it is called Maggie, not "cube") do not mix.  Homework is too un-fun and cubing is too much fun.  I'm putting out this next message to all that oppose me having the spoon.  Beware, the spoon is strong and shall stay in my grasp!  For those attempt to take the spoon...  Death or another unlikely happening will follow.  I was particulary angered yesterday when someone tried to rape me of the spoon.  I swear that if the spoon leaves my being the person who took it will pay.  I will use black-mail, bribery, and other such bad nouns to get it back.  This means you Maggie, Jason, and both Lauras.  The four of you are walking on thin ice now and one more aggressive move from any person will mean  bad stuff !  I'm sorry I had to say that, but last night I was pissed!  Beware!  The spoon means death for those that oppose it and for those that support glory will follow.  Have a good night sleep, my fellow nigtits!
