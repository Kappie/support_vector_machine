I love listening to books on tape! it's sooo wonderful because you don't have to turn the pagfes and you can just rest!  I had a really horrible dream where I walked to my old house and it was super stormy and creepy..then I couldn't find my way home.  Today I am going to clean the house..I need money for San Diego!  It will be scary..I have never gone on a plane with out my mum and dad.  La de da. Ooh! My parents are going out to eat..thats means! Pizza! wait no. GR! I asked my mom and we are having lasanga. Grr! I want pizza!! :)  Maybe I will cook some potstickers.. Yum!  Talk to you later!  Laura Fantora
