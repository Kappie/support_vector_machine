IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much fun!!!!! let me tell you how it went:  FRIDAY: left school at 1:30 and drove for about an hour to catch the ferry at tsawassen to go to nanaimo. during the busride all we did was listen to music and other normal stuff like that. i sat with matthew for all the busrides of the trip--rather, he sat by me. anyways. when we got to the ferry place we had to wait for like 30-45 minutes before we coudl board the ferry and i fell asleep coz i had a horrendous headache. anyways, the ferry ride was hilarious. me and frances and ren and matthew and alex and jonathan all sat near each other and we were telling LAME jokes such as "why did the monkey fall out of the tree? BECAUSE IT WAS DEAD" and frances started making up jokes such as "why did the bird lay an egg? BECAUSE IT WANTED A BABY!!" and she'd go hysterical. finally we arrived at nanaimo and then we drove for about 30-45 minutes until we got to nanaimo church where we ate dinner and then went home with our billets. our billet had a son with down syndrome that was about 9 years old or somewhere around there. he was HILARIOUS. he was really excited that we were going to be sleepin at his house and he was like "mom, can i sleep with the girls tonight? i like girls!" and then he was like showing us all his stuff in his house and he was looking through our stuff and saying the most hilarious things which i dont think i shoudl really get into detail. anyways, when he had to go to bed he was like "goodnight sweeties!" it was pretty funny.  SATURDAY: woke up around 8:00 and got ready and wen to church for our lovely performance, which according to Mr. hosking received an 8.5/10 so that means that it was pretty good. after eating we drove down to victoria. that took anywhere from 1-2.5 hours. everyone had to go to the washroom so we stopped at the empress hotel to use the public washroom there. OMG inside the empress hotel, well the part that i saw, its soooo nice in there. i got inspired by the lounge type pianist thatwas playin in the lil restaurant that was serving 4:00 tea. anyways, when we got to the beach, the weather on saturday had already been sun with clouds and we went to the beach so it was really windy. we stayed there for the longest time. it was alright coz we walked along the beach and found this really long kelp thing that must've been at least 20 feet long and i dragged it from where i found it for about a kilometre back to the bus. it was hilarious coz it was stuck in the sand with all this seaweed and when i was dragging it and pulling it out it got even longer and then it dragged this whole pile of seaweed with it and even a big branch thing too. anyways. after that we had to had dinner which was pre-ordered taco time which was pretty good.. and then we sat around or stood around for like an hour in the blistering cold coz it was freakin windy and finally they had worship and it was off to the motel. we stayed in a place called "blue ridge inns" it wasnt too bad. pretty good. when we were there a bunch of ppl went swimming, me, frances, ren, matthew, tiff, brittney, jon, and alex and mr. hosking went to tim hortons and a couple of them bought ice caps. then me and brittney bought a large popcorn chicken and shared it between the two of us.  while everyone was hanging around me and brittney were sooo bored so we got the brilliant idea to fill our bathtub with icecubes! so we got a small layer on the bottom of the tub and then it was melting pretty quickly coz our room was sooo hot. so we decided that we were gonna put sum water in the tub and make ice tea in the bathtub. that didnt work well coz tea only works in hot water so we made some tea in the sink and then made more tea in the bathtub. we used about 6 or 7 tea bags and then one burst so we started ripping them all open until the water was filled with black specks and then we started putting pepper and coffee whitener in it. it was hilarious. then we put shampoo in the toilet in hopes that when someone flushed it it would foam everywhere. it didnt work. anyways. when everyone had to go to bed, it was like 11:00 and we were just sitting around talking on the phone to the guys in the other room. frances eventually fell asleep and then brittney was talkin to jon on the phone for forever and me n tiff were bored so we put on my discman and started belting out the lyrics to cher, michael jackson, and tonz of other oldies songs and aqua. brittney was laughing at us. soon she was done on the phone and we were so hyper coz brittney made a pot of coffee and drank the whole thing and i brough chocolate covered espresso beans which we finished and i had had like 3 chocolate bars and a can of pop and like all this other candy. me and brittney and tiff were gonna make a dance routine to a song. then the phone rang and tiff was on the phone forever with alex so me and brittney got even more hyper by eating more candy [fuzzy peaches] and we both ate two packets of sugar that was provided. well, i ate mine both, but the first time we were looking at each other and brittney started laughing and spit sugar all over the place. the second time we decided not to look so we wouldnt laugh and then we turned and looked at each other and she spat her sugar all over the place and it went in the path of the fan and went all over my face. it was hilarious. anyways. after that we were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO hyper. our room was so hot from our moving around so much that the window was just dripping like a waterfall with condensation. anyways we still wanted to make our dance routine so in order to get ideas we decided to put the tv on MUCH MUSIC and copy all the dance moves of the ppl in the music videos and our dancing was hilarious and we were so hyper that every 2 seconds we'd be fallin on the floor laughign soooooo hard. it was hilarious. and tiff was just lookin at us like we were morons. finally it became 4:00 in the morning and we were still hyper as hell and frances and tiff couldnt sleep coz me n brittney were soooo loud and hyper jumpin around and laughin so hard. finally we decided to settle down but we were wide awake and just sittin on the beds in the dark. finally around 5:15 we fell asleep and woke up about 2.5 hours later.  SUNDAY: woke up around 8. finally got up around 8:30. left the inn around 9:30. drove to craigdarroch castle. me and brittney were WIDE awake considering our 2.5-ish hours of sleep. i had a slight headache, but other than that i was pumped. sorta hungover from our caffeine/sugar hight, but it was ok. after craigdarroch castle, which was pretty cool, we went to inner harbour victoria, which is like downtown vancouver except not as busy and we were given 3 hours to walk around and do whatever we wanted just meet back at the bus in time to leave so that we could catch our ferry back. me, fran, ren, and matt walked around, went to the mall, ate in the food court [a and orange julius] and then we tried on dresses [only me and frances] then we went to this gift shop where i bought some Kahlua filled chocolates and some champagne filled chocolates which were absolutely delicious.. the kahlua ones were soooo awesome... i ate them all except theres one kahlua one left. anywyas. after the gift shop, we used the washroom in the empress hotel.... again.. and then boarded the bus for the almost hour long ride to the ferry place. when we got there we had to wait coz we were early for the ferry we had to wait about 45 minutes. then we boarded, and it was so crowded that we sat on the floor for a bit and then went upstairs and walked around outside and then went inside and ate white spot burgers. anyways. after the ferry, we drove the hour-ish long trip back to the school where we got picked up and then frances's mom dropped me off at home. now i am home sweet home.  its good to be home. tour was so awesomely fun. i'll remember it forever. i only got one picture though... with CODY.. the down syndrome kid. he wanted to take a picture with us girls. hehehe. anyways. now i am home. i am tired. i bought mom a spoon from victoria for a souvenir and i just gave it to her. i am tired. tired tired tired. i have homework. homework home work homework. chemistry. yay yay yay yay. must do now. this is a long blog. probly boring to with all my rambling on and on and on and on and on and on and on... oh well..........
