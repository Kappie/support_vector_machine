Overall, I had a very nice time there. It was fun bunking with everyone in one room, even if it meant being flashed by a classmate, or talking about things we really shouldn't have been talking about. *coughsexcough* XD XD Of course, our facilitators weren't very encouraging either. Brother Pao and Brother Bernard were back with a vengance, and this time with a new sidekick, Brother Mike. And yeah, they acted as gay as ever. But what the hell, it was still fun. The food was great too. :D Good thing we only stayed for three days, or I seriously would have gained weight. The bathroom. Ah. Many things happend in the bathroom. It was the place where we all met one way or another. My classmates actually gave each other tips on how to take a poo. O_o I dubbed it, B Cubed, or Bayanihan's BathroomBonding.It needs a better drainage system tho. The floor was always wet.  Anyway, the programs and activities were alright. I accidentaly fell asleep through part of the most important activity. O_o Bad Ria, bad! But I woke up just as the interacting part began. T_T I'm such a bad person.  But there were worse people than me that day. 14 unsurrendered cellphones were confiscated just as the Retreat ended, all because one of them text the incoming section. I heard they're now faced with Supervised work, and possible suspension. It's a good thing my mom made me feel guilty about bringing my phone, or else I wouldn't have left mine at home.  The way home was cold. Exremely. O_o I couldn't feel my fingers. Seriously. I had to share Guia's jacket with Racine to keep alive in the bus. The two sitting behind us actually brought out a blanket. O_O Lucky them.   That's pretty much the retreat. n_n;
