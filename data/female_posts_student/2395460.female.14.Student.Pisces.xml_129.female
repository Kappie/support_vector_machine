The set includes shower gel (so it's soap scented soap) and a bottle of  urlLink Pure Grace Fragrance Spray . I got to sample this and it's very authentically soapy. So much so you'll wonder if you skimped on the rinse cycle during your last shower. I'm always searching for the perfect non-perfumey perfume, and even those much hyped  urlLink Clean Perfumes  are a little heavy to me.   Did you know that scent is the most evocative of the senses?  urlLink Smell is powerful . So if you spritz on a little Pure Grace, no one will really notice that your hair is sopped with grease and you have soot stains on your face.
