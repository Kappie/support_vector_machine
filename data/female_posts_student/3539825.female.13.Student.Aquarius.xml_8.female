(im pretty dumb) well anyway we would have just driven down there and let granny drive us back up here, but she just got some blood stream infection and so she cant drive us there. so of course the first thing my mom did was yell for her idiot boyfriend and his bozo daughter, lauren. im not really sure what makes bobby so creepy but he just has that way of really creeping you out and his daughter is just a little, or a lot, boring. so all im gonna say is thank you to the person who invented portable cd players, cuz im gonna need to plug my ears with something.
