     
      					 Moments   			Once when I was walking sanely, 				I remember the times when we were alone.  			Both were quiet, never talking much, 				But we seem to know what's in both our minds.  			Oh, the moments when we stopped and looked at one another, 				Was the moment when I know we're meant for each other. 			Can we go back in time, can we hope for last time, 				I'll never forget you, and hope you never do.
