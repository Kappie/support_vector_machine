I have a comic book due tomorrow, and that's it. so finals are the only thing im gonna have to really worry about for the rest of this school year. YAY. well that and.. something else. oh yeah and my friends party and my b-day party, which i decided to have. I'm just not gonna invite the guy I like. it would be too stressfull. I'll invite him if he asks about it, but I'd probably do that for anyone if I liked them. yeah i know im a huge wimp, but im just not someone to really put my heart out on the line. It's not like my life's horrible without a guy. yeah well anyways yeah im having my party and im not going to water polo today. that's pretty much all that's really happening. wow there's this thing on the discovery channel right now. and it's talking aobut how a dead snake can still bite you cuz it's brains nerve cells can still work. yeah crazy huh? i don't get why some people think that if you watch the discovery channel your weird. They have some really cool shows on it. like american chopper, Mythbusters and more. you should check it out someday. ok well that's it for now buh bye -drea
