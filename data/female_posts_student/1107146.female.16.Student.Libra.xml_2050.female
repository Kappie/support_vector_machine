Glen is actually pretty cool. He can make a mean prime rib. He has lots of money and makes really annoying jokes when it comes to money or the lack or overabundance thereof of said substance. He has a really annoying laugh and uses it like a nine-year old. Like, he's watching VH1, and someone just made a joke about Jenna Jameson being a dirty whore (porn star, but I hope you all knew that), and he laughed his ASS off. He squeals better than I do. He drives a Concord LXI and is saving up to buy a Mercedes SLX, convertible, no less, in cash. I have seen him no less than eight times in the last twenty days, topping any records of actually glimpsing the guy by a long shot...try: ever. He's a likable dude, tho. I think they're seriously planning on getting married. Which isn't any problem, I just wish they would come the hell out and say it.  So there's a post, by dammit. Woo! Let's all talk about Glen and ask questions so that I can really figure out if I hate him or if I just want his money!  Or we could talk about "mirror flirting" for a while...see   ANTIPHILANTHROPHY   for details. I was almost going to get on line, then I got tired. Rob better improve or he might find himself poised below the long end of my booted leg. Ja, ja, he's a sugardaddy, but I think he can do better. A "hi" would be mighty, mighty impressive at this point. I say make him really embarrassed, and then tell him you're doing it intentionally until he pays more attention, that'll confuse him and make him clean up at the same time. I'm serious, you could be direct as hell aboot telling him your intentions and he'll be really confused as to why you're telling him, but he'll still try to improve.   But that requires a little not-Lindsey work, so we're not counting aboot that one, eh. I guess it's the boot.  Heh heh heh.
