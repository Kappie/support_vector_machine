The loss of innosence the loss of life    Joy now filled with grief, we ask ourselves why    No reason, no cause, no justification to be done    Things that have happened should never need to be spoken    The people who knew you remember the laughter that is now silent    With your name now comes a smile that can never be broken    As they remember the times that have been    They also mourn for the times that now can not be    Sorrow for the dreams that can not be lived    But with the consolation that they have been dreamted    And with the memories that can never be forgotten    We find hope in the furture as we remember the past      i thought that was a good poem to think about today.      i still cannot belive this...      why, why, why?      today was alright....but i had him on my mind the entire time. today was pretty hard for me. i tryed to hide it. but i still thought about what was going on. everyones mood was different today. more sad than normal. nothing seemed good.this is unbelivable...       * R.I.P Austin Hakes *
