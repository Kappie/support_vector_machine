I cant wait until I get the pictures of last night they are going to be so good. However, me and Kenny's couple picture might be weird because of the way that the lady made us pose but I don't care as long as we don't look funny. I really hope that girls group photo that we get is the funny one because I really like that one.    All I have left to say is thank you Kenny for making my night so special. I love you more then anything.
