It will indicate all people who believe it is completely ok, if not good, to break the law or do things that would otherwise seem unjust or cruel.   Have you ever wondered WHY exactly there are evil people?   But, then again, have you ever wondered why exacty there are good people?   But, beside that point, why do people with a particularly wide evil streak even exist? Balance? Maybe. Maybe you need the positive and the negative to create a balance, a neutral earth, kind of like in electricity, atoms, and life as a whole. But then you have those who are beyond the line who are more than just a little nasty, more than a little crooked, like serial killers, slave traders, or people who enjoy torturing, for example. What is their motive to kill, to hurt? Some inner satisfaction? Obviously, they have no emotion towards killing (any negative emotion, that is) or else they wouldn't be able to do it.   Now, for the other part of my topic, power. Everyone enjoys a little power. A little attention, a little control over others. And leaders of countries (most of the time) enjoy it and embellish in it Most of the time they put it to good use. I'm not talking about your average everyday president or prime minister here. Like in every fantasy novel, there is always the villain or supervillain who hungers for power and will do anything to control the world, or, enslave a village or destroy a city. Lord of the Rings is an excellent example. A life example, hitler, can be said to be a little over the edge.  Now, if I were a hero or saviour in one of those fantasy stories, I'd go right up to the evil mastermind and ask, "So, let us say that you will probably take over this city. In fact, let us believe you have taken over all you can reach with your horde of evil followers. What then? Will you live an evil, dirty, unjust life stealing and fighting endlessly with each other? I certainly wouldn't know what to do with all the land and people because, in such a condition, nobody lives happily. You would probably consume all the available resources at an alarming rate, ending you up in a much less admirable predicament than before you even started this rampage. What then?"   I don't know if that would boggle them or not. But, then again, I am not evil myself. I so wish that everyone, one day of their lives to be able to live, see and think in all the world's different lifestyles(economically, ethnically, good and evil). If we all understood each other, would there really be anything to fight about? Maybe, it might stop racism. Maybe prejudism outright! Even crime! Ah, but then we'll overpopulate the world with good people... what would be the fun in that? It would get quite boring... :P   Solieus, signing off.
