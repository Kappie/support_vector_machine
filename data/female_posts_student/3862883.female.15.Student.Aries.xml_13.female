There were some similarities with the book and the movie. The first one is the little ships arraving to the land. I know it is not same with the book, but the thing that is same is how the savages scared and can not protect their selfs or fight with the soldiers. They are just nothing. Another thing is Marlows personality it is similiar with the book.
