It may even touch on a few things that I'm experiencing right now.   I feel a little stuck, a little limited, maybe somewhat like I need a fresh new lemon-lit brush of hope in my near future. Perhaps I just need to trust myself more.   I look every which way, I don't know exactly which direction I want to go, but the transition period is like the birthing process. Yet isn't everything? I've stayed in the womb for so long, maybe 10 or 11 months, and the mother is past restlessness. I'm getting too big. I feel too big. I don't know what the next step will be.   Or I'm on the edge of a cliff. I just want to be pushed off the cliff and into another space so I can "back up" and continue searching. Or I could jump.   I don't want to feel worthless or useless or unmagnificent, but I do sometimes. Can't I enjoy a little period of free nothing? And in a way, I am, but I'm worried I'm not using my time wisely. I need to go someplace that I'm needed and I have a responsibility to go there.  Yet I need to be more discontent, because I am not enough.  All my life, well, for much of the recent past, I've dedicated myself to live an authentic life in search of an authentic self and I wonder how to exist anymore in certain situations. Perhaps my goal is to learn that there are elements of authenticity in everything. But I've only focused on myself and on religion for my whole life. Sometimes I think I honestly might be well suited for some pastoral convent. But that would almost be too easy for me.  The thing is, it's not a wanting or a lack of wanting that characterizes my life in the crossroads of being in my (almost) mid-20s and finished with college (so far). It's more of a watching and waiting to make some kind of decision, to fall recklessly into the storm-ridden sky plugged with frizzles of purple and gold into other seasons, the cool inside of an expansive but not eternal lava lamp (kudos to Josh for that one), feeling my bare feet hitting the clouds that are strange compositions of not the usual cotton, but deep oceans and gel clumps and just-before-the-rain kind of air.  I'm glad this blog is called "rambings from the well." I seem to take the term literally. Back to the book. Or I will call Jaci.  Jaci, where are you? It's time to watch the Dawson's Creek dvd (wink).
