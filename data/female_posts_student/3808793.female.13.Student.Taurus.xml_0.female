This wouldn't be such a problem, of course, if I didn't have 2 open Star Wars Galaxies accounts, one with a Master Tailor with outstanding orders.   Sure, SWG is fun and all. The social aspects are neat, and SWG Fan Fest was a ton of fun. The Entertainer line of professions are quite cool (except for the fact that we demand more content and never get any), and I like being a crafter.  But the combat...  I don't know how it's any different from Anarchy Online. Don't ask me. It's still the same format; click some buttons and wait and hope you don't die, maybe heal yourself real quick.   Wait- there it is.  Profession balance and diversity.  I tried every AO profession during my 1-2 year stint there at least once for some length of time. I enjoyed every one, for at least some length of time. I didn't feel unbalanced in any of them, except for Adventurer (and that's because I screwed my character up royally). I wasn't trying to run huge raids or anything, just doing missions. And I enjoyed it. I could have 8 characters, so- hey, maybe I feel like some pet class work, and making some money, I log in my Meta-Physicist and run some high-level missions. Maybe I feel like missioning with some friends, I'll log in my gimpy Adventurer and rely on them for help. Maybe I feel particularly brave and log in my Doctor, do some healing. Maybe I feel like being really, really short and sneaking around; I'll log in my Agent. Maybe I feel like running fast and shooting crap, I'll log in my Fixer. Maybe I want to punch things, here comes my Martial Artist. Maybe I want to nuke things and make pretty effects, out goes the Nanotechnician. Maybe I want to use robots and shoot things, yay for my Engineer.   There was so much class diversity, depending upon my mood, I could do whatever I wanted. Or if I didn't feel like really playing at all, grab the pack full of social clothes on my gimpy Adventurer and go do some casual roleplaying. There was SO MUCH TO DO. Everyone always said 'blah blah blah, no high end content.' I never hit high levels, so my characters were always growing and changing. I was always finding something new, due to my many different characters, and I could change at the drop of a hat. Reset points allowed me to toss my skills around, depending upon what I found important. I could be a very fast runner and not have to worry about angry animals with high Run Speed bonuses, or reset all my sword skills and throw them into pistols and change weapons. Sure, it took some work- I needed all new implant layouts and armor- but I was able to change the direction of my character entirely.  The other thing I loved? The community and the world. So many people helped make Rubi-Ka seem truly alive, with a lived in feel. Ships flew overhead. Billboards glared at you in Omni-1 Entertainment advertising everything from armor to drugs to whores (not kidding about those last two...). If you liked to explore- great. There were plenty of hidden 'hot spots' all over Rubi-Ka to go check out. If you didn't, there was very little unnecessary travel. If you're beyond a certain level, just hop in the Grid (the internet in 29000, apparently) and go there. Or take the whompas, though those won't get you everywhere. Roleplayers made up events to create a living, breathing world- illegal leet fights, pitting creatures against eachother, murders, assassinations, parties.   I suppose old habits die hard- it's all coming back to me already. How to cast my pets, how to blitz a mission, how to use the grid, how to find a group, how to dance. How to cast a nano, how to build implants, how to heal someone. The GridStream Productions parties, the indoor missions, the loot you found on almost every dead mob, the abbreviations, Jobe, Omni-1 Trade. And of course, that little voice when you first log in.  Welcome to Rubi-Ka.  Checking integrity....3/50...
