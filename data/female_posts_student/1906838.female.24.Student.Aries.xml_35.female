WHOAAAAA.... i knew atik is pregs and i knew mus had given birth but it wasnt until i saw those pictures that the reality of it all actually sunk in. and didi's engagement pics.. awww... she looks SOOOOOO AYU AND PRETTY ...my dear friend didi.  seeing all those pics i cant help but wish i were there.. meeting up with u guys, being with didi on her special day. goodness me...my friends are all grown up.. either engaged or married. typical because we are all at THAT age. 24. my mom had me when she was 23. I AM OLDER THAN MY MOM THAN WHEN SHE HAD HER FIRST BABY.  not that im bothered about it. there is no hard and fixed rule that says, you must get ur life sorted out, married and have ur first child by the time u are 25. so no im NOT bothered by the fact that i am not as 'laju' as some of my peers as far as such milestones are concerned.  Gawd i HATE EXAMS. d-uh who does? hahaha.. probably zak's most favourite person K.H. does. when i was in lodge, one of the boys 2 years above me won an essay competition about how exams should be abolished. exams, he wrote, stands for E-EXASPERATING, X-XENOPHOBIC, A-ATROCIOUS, M-MADDENING, S-STUPID. he mustve been in Primary 6 or something when he wrote that .. and d-uh that was the FIRST and only time ive ever seen the word XENOPHOBIC being used. how he ever came up with that word during the essay competition is beyond me.  NOW I HAVE TO LEARN MY ANTIBIOTICS.yes.. LEARN .. not TAKE.
