"You might be best friends one year,  pretty good friends the next year,  don't talk that often the next year,  and don't want to talk at all the year after that.   So, I just wanted to say,  even if I never talk to you again in my life,  you are special to me and you have made a difference in my life,  I look up to you, respect you, and truly cherish you."
