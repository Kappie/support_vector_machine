I am babysitting them during the weeks that they orginally would be at their dads house but he didnt want them because he is remarried so anyway....I arrived around 6:30 and watched t.v. till they got up i wasnt expecting them till like 9 or 10 but surprise suprise they got up at almost 8. By 10:30 they were bored and ready for lunch so we popped a pizza in the oven and sat down and played playdough! i forgot how much fun that stuff was with the McDonalds set until it got under my nails and i was left with the mess when the playdough lost their interest. So lunch came and went me and Heather made friendship bracelets and then made brownies, but since we couldnt fine the right pan we made them in cupcake dishes. Blake then informed me he wouldnt eat them because he hated cupcakes and those looked like cupcakes, no persuading would change his mind, so me and Heather chowed down for the rest of the day(they were excellent). We then went out side and played gotcha and horse with the basketballs, i had forgotten how bad and uncoordinated i was at this i could stand 5 feet from the goal and miss it was sad, but they thought it was hilarious so at least all wasnt lost right?! We then went inside ate more food(they are like extreme snackers) and played sock football in the living room. Then we settled down to t.v. and a dry erase board until their mom came home at 4ish. Over all though it was lots of fun i havent been that active in a while really but i did go home and nap till 6ish and then took a run after dinner. Ben came over we had a nice talk i got some nerd ropes the most fabulous candy of course i am now going to bed because im zonked and still have to get up at 5:15 again.. so good night
