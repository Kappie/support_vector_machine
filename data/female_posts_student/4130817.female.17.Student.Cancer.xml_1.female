As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over.' "  Friendship is a very amazing thing, we should all have friends so we can express ourselves to other people and the world with our friends. If you dont have friendship you dont have manythings. It has been proven that people who grow up without people being around them and then them not expressing any of there feelings about things in the world dont grow up normal, but then again what is normal? I for sure am not normal and that is why i hang out with people who are not normal to, but again who sets the standards for normal?? Friends should be treasured and loved for you might lose them in a heart beat. This would have been a great quote for my group a few months ago cause everyone was fighting over some very stupid things, I dont even remember what it was over but now it is finished and I am glad because I think it just adds pressure to everyone when no one is getting along. Well I dont know if I have anything else to talk about now but if I come up with something later, I will write!! laters ~ashley~
