People are spreading their surprises all over their blogs.  Actually, I'm one of the heard-the-news-and-come people and I'm still in a shock by seeing this amazing designs and functions of blogger.com.  I'm not thinking of moving my sketchbook::elendil to here, but I'll certainly use this blog for another purpose... for scratching. :-)  Happy to be here, and thank you, blogger team.
