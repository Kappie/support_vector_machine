I'm starting to feel a little old but I know that deep down inside this girl that people see in me, there's a kid playing around inside. It's my birthday and I feel good about it...because my friends remembered this special day and greeted me. Maybe they only remembered it because I reminded them days before that it is, in fact, birthday. But no matter how they remembered it, I still feel glad that they did. Maybe the reason why I reminded them is because I want to feel really really special at least fro one day. Birthday wish?? I dunno... I just want my father to have a decent and stable job right now. I haven't told this to anyone becasue I just want to keep it to myself. I feel sad about it because I know that a lot of people already took advantage of my father and he doesn't deserve that. He's a hardworking person and I want him to have a job where he'll definitely excel. Anyway, enough about it I might shed a tear if I keep talking about it. My birthday wish... actually wishes is (1) to have good grades for the whole year or maybe forever!!! haha =) (2) for my father to have a job (3) good health for me, my friends and definitely my family (4) for my brother to become mature man that he should be right now (5) last but not the least, a great guy who'll treat me right and love for who I am... but to tell you honestly my last wish can wait a little longer I don't want to speed things up with my love life. In fact, I'm happy being single. Just enjoying the company of my friends and family. Sometimes it's nice being alone but sometimes there comes a point in life where you want someone to be there. Guess I'm already in the middle of that situation. Anyway, I'm pretty bummed right now with test results in NSTP. Imagine 3 over 10...what a score!!??? Plus I need to report for my Philo Psych class... ha!!!  got to go!!! bye! wish me luck...Hope I'll have a "happy" birthday!!! =)
