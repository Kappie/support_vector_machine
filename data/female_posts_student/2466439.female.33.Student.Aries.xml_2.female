Danielle and Nathan gave me this wonderful scrapbook.  I really like it.  I am sad to be leaving them.  We had some really good times.  I am sorry about leaving Marsha, too.  Maybe I made more friends here than I thought I had.  I wish I had a more clear-cut answer about what comes next.  When people ask, I tell them about plan A and plan B.    Today marks five years since mom died.  I wish she could be at graduation.  Mom would have harassed the family to try and get them there.  But I guess they came even without any harassment at all.  I would have had to deal with awkwardness if Dad had come.  I wonder if he would have come if mom were still around.  I have been thinking a lot lately about just why it is I feel like I cannot fit in here.  I mean, I got plenty of crap for being queer when I lived in Chicago.  More, in overt ways, than I ever have gotten here.  Maybe it is just that the culture here is just different enough that I have never felt comfortable.  I will be glad to be back where I am on familiar ground.  Is it dumb that I feel like I am living amongst foreigners here?    I am glad I have spent some time in the south, though.  I feel like I got rid of some dumb ideas just by being here.  Of course, I also have some new ideas about what the south is like.  I had never even heard the word preacher used except by African Americans until I got here.    I wonder if Becky is feeling the same thing in Michigan -- like she is a foreigner.  I remember how hard it was for me my first year here.  It was real culture shock, and I did not expect that, since it is the same country and all!  Part of it was moving to such a small town, though.  I am a city girl at heart.
