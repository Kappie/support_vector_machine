We borrowed a few movies, I read a bit, laid in bed and basiclly did nothing which was perfect! For a few minutes, I forgot about Nick...then I remembered...then I felt like a horrible mother for forgetting...then I wondered what Nick was doing right then...then I missed Nick sooooooo much. I couldn't wait to go and get him so I could hold him, smell him, kiss him and hug Nick! He had a good time at his G'ma/pa's house. He slept for most of his stay. Yesterday, after work, Shawn, Nick and I went up to Mike and Jess's house. Nick was more his usual self up there compared to last weekend-last Saturday he was an angel! Shawn and I had so much fun! We ate, drank, talked, played with the cutest puppies ever again, and rode in the field! Great Saturday!   I am absolutely exhausted. It has been way too hot. Rain tomorrow!
