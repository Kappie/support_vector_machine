G didn't pick up his phone yesterday...wonder why...gasak dier lah nak buat aper... niwae last night i went out and was going to mac with two of my friends when i saw R... R is my ex, we broke up like 6 months ago i think and guess what, i completely forgot i was wearing the necklace he gave me on our two month anniversary. i don't know why the hell i wore it. i guess i thought it looked pretty and all and it matched my outfit sooo well i just, didn't expect to bump into him of all people... feelings sure began to stir a little last night. well, everythings over now i should just forget about it...right? THIS is what happens when your boyfriend stops picking up his phone and you haven't met him for almost two weeks....other guys start to attract your attention....oh crap...huzz...G y aren't you picking up??? the last time we talked was like 2 days ago... G, G... where are you?  what are you doing now? are you thinking of me? don't you miss me? G....i miss you...
