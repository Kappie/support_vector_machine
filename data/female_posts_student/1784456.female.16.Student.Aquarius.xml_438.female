Hehe, yeah, I do want to go on Monkey Island right now. Geez, it's so hot that... I'm wearing a dress! :O Yeah, but no one's gonna see me and I'm warm now! ...hee hee! (This person on Monkey Island 4 has some thing about going hee hee at the end of every sentance!) Now who does that remind you of? (Laura!) Grr... I guess it is good to be back at school, but it's bad cause we gotta do French and Maths again. :( I better go win monkey island! (Yeah right, you forgot how to do every thing, remember?) Uhh.... (Yes, you do!) Leave me alone! *stomps off* (Ooooh, get her!) Ahem... just a bit mad aye? ;) If life wasn't confusing it wouldn't be so fun! Hey, isn't that true or is it just me?
