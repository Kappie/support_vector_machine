Two things are pissing me off: MSN Messenger and BlogSpot. MSN wont let me send IMs, and BlogSpot isn't helping with the group blog that my buds and I want to set up. B-E-A-U-TIFUL.      I'm listening to John Lennon's Imagine ATM... Such a great song. *switches to a different song* Now I'm listening to 'Boys'... Great song too, but why the hell didn't they change it to 'Girls'? Makes Ringo sound...funny.      Guess what I found today? The CD single of Savage Garden's I Knew I Loved You! I can't escape that song! I hear it on the radio and everything  all the time ! >o[      Spent a lot of time daydreaming about 1960's Paul McCartney today... Just can't help myself.. Well, if you were a girl like me, would you rather think about trig, functions or boys?    Ooh, The OC's on in 5ish minutes! One hour of Adam Brody goodness... =o9 LaTeRz!!!    Useless Camille Fact #452: I hate it when MSN convos only consist of four lines. Eg:       Me: Hi there!   Other Person: Hey!   Me: How are you?/What's up?/Whatchu talkin' 'bout Willis?   Other Person: Good./Nothing much./Nyehh.
