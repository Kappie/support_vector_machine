It wasn't nearly as long as I thought it would be (20 minutes), and my technique wasn't too horrible, mostly. I screwed up on my List A piece though o.O Missed a whole 3 bars. But I just skipped past it and I thought I recovered really well, so hopefully the examiner won't take lots of marks off... OMG, the examiner was like Lynn's mother in Gilmore Girls *cringes* Except Chinese. Harsh, short, and heavily accented. I was moderately surprised that she didn't bow when I left. Of course... maybe I just didn't deserve to be bowed at *sigh*   Also: have I mentioned I'm volunteering with the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario? Yup. Him and MF, the head of DareARTS, have recruited me, with the help of NH, to write stories and find books for the drug-addicted children of Northern Ontario. I have to discover little fables from their Native American heritage, and we are to teach them morals and values. This should look good on my resume, eh? Of course, that doesn't make this any more fun. *grumbles*   I'm redoing my website. Iunno why. Probably because the old way didn't work on Mozilla, and now that my IE browser is screwy (5 seconds after opening it, a little error pops up saying it has to close), I want it to look good everywhere... so it's much more lowkey now. But still kinda pretty. Just wait 'till you see my Epic mini-site though!! It looks damn professional, I'll tell ya that ^^;;; *cackles*   I've watched Spirited Away 3 times now. Now for Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service...   *loserloserloserloserloserloserloser...*   Well, I'm gonna take my list of books to NH now, so byee guys, have a nice life, see ya on the sunny side.
