I bought 4 new pairs of underwear from Aeropostale (2 thongs and 2 lowrise boy cuts), stuff for the girls that are coming to my party, a GA Bulldogs shirt, a FLA Gators shirt, and a bunch of stuff from the Icing. Me and my grandmother got to talk about stuff, and I think we bonded. I'm glad I got to spend time with her. Tomorrow Im going shopping with my mommy, that should be fun. Hopefully on Saturday (around 12) i'll get to spend some tmie with Blake, if he's not busy. We wont get to spend time together b/c he has to work. :( But I miss him sooo much. Then Saturday afternoon my friends (as in my gurls thaty i love and miss already) are coming over for a swimmin party. Thats gonna be awesome!!! Well, thats about it... lots of love!
