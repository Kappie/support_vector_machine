Foriegn leaves skittered after her, pushing her further away from their familiar habitat, chasing her to the border of her own world. Falling - to her inexorable melancholy bare-existance.  She'd like to see the arrow splintered in his pulse, she'd like to see his eyes flood with lies. Drawing in. Sucking; bleeding; watching you gasping. A little smile plays upon her lips, her eyes excitedly wide - they narrow again, as her fingers step to a lament only she can hear, echoing throughout her hollow mind.  Numb. Entrapt in this bitter wind.  Kneeling down in the dirt, one long nail traces a symbol. Lifting a blue teardrop from beneath small lashes - it's blessed. Rising, dizzy with energy, she falters, regains control, she holds the chains now.  She binds and sways the wind to her desire, encircling her 'til she cannot breathe. She'll take your breath with her instead.   blah blah blah, *skins herself n hangs it up to dry* 'take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green n the girls are pretty* wow i hav so much to say xBWx :(
