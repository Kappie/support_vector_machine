But the food is quite nice.   Maked a lip-balm for Jasmine, everyone was surprise that I can make this kind of thing, hehe, thanks to  urlLink Tomoko .  Refer to the last post, about a friend of mind who hates the gardening, now I really feel like want to give her a punch. Well, when we were eating, my friend want to lend me her spoon for my Fish n chips, but then her spoon was full with meet, so I didn't use her spoon. Then that girl suggest them to buy me a tudung on my birthday, because I don't have meat in my meal. Ah, she is such a unwisdom girl. She talked like a standard one student.   Ah, forget about it.
