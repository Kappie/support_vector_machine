Although he is most often recognized  for his poetry, he has also published many works of fiction, criticism, and cultural history, while  being a painter and an editor all at the same time. He is a personal favorite of mine with his standard breaking language techniques, originality, and satire. All of his writing is so interesting, it's hard to stop  reading once you start. The piece above and the ones to  follow truly stuck out at me today.   Why do you paint? For exactly the same reason I breathe.  That's not an answer.  How long hasn't there been an answer? As long as I can remember? I mean poetry. So do I.  Tell me, doesn't your painting interfere      with your writing? Quite the contrary;they love eachother dearly. They're very different. Very: one is painting and one is writing. But your poems are rather hard to understand,whereas      your paintings are so easy. Easy? Of course--you paint flowers and girls and sunset;      things that everybody understands. I never met him.  Who? Everybody.  Did you ever hear of a nonrepresentational painter? I am.  Pardon me? I am a painter, and painting is nonrepresentational. Not all painting. No:housepainting is representational. And what does a housepainter represent? Ten dollars an hour.  In other words, you don't want to be serious-- It takes two to be serious. Well, let's see...oh yes, one more question:      where will you live after this war is       over? In China, as usual.  China? Of course. Whereabouts in China? Where a painter is a poet.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ death has a smile like the nicest man you've never met who maybe winks at you in a streetcar and you pretend you don't but really you do see and you are My how glad he winked and  hope he'll do it again.
