Today I helped my Dad and Ben unload the van and the trucks to store their stuff in our garage and well I am just kind of taking it easy today and hopefully I will get a hold of Chels to talk to her for a while.  And well I feel like I am the queen of eating or something like that because I had breakfast and then like an hour after that everyone was eating lunch and desert so I couldn't help but stare at the food so I decided to eat lunch to.  Little did I know though is that I would end up eating pie and ice cream too.  Hopefully I won't gain too much weight from that but I should be fine as long as I don't keep that up.  Now I think I am going to go and enjoy my last day of holidays!
