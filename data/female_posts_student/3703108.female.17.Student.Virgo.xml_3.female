I know that will probably make me sound like a dork, but guess what...I don't care! I'm a Christian and I'm proud of it! I like going to Church. Anyway, I'm going to Kobbie's surprise party after Church today. There are too many parties! It stresses me out. I like a new boy. I don't know why I like him, but I do. I'm not going to say who it is, just incase someone I know reads this. But it was really weird because I was trying not to like him because he had a girlfriend who he's been with for like a million years and everyone says they're going to get married and I didn't want to interfere with that. But the other day, Kristin told me that they broke up! I can't believe it! Anyway, I'm excited because I get to see him today and I told Noelle that I like him, so she's going to see what she can do about it. I'm sure nothing will happen, but I'll probably regret it if I don't try. When I told Noelle about it yesterday, it made me really happy because she said he would be perfect for me. Hehe! Like every girl in the world (or at least our school) likes him. I feel like I would never even have a chance with him, but you never know. I gotta go get ready. See ya!
