I fingered the bottle, beneath the fabric of my purse, ignored the flowers, and offered him my arm.  This was going to be too easy.  Good ol' Joe was as regular as clockwork. The guy drove a friggin' Saturn... a friggin' TAN Saturn, no less.  I almost sighed when I saw that car (Too much was too much!), but I covered it with a delicate yawn.  "Long day." I commented when Joe raised an eyebrow at the yawn.  "Well, er... hopefully I can make it shorter! That is.. I mean make it longer, but gooder. I mean, good! That is... ummm..."  I giggled, boys and girls. I really and trully did. Who could help it? He was almost cute, stammering like a 17 year old boy on his first date.  I did him a favor and took the shovel from his mouth before he could dig any deeper.  "So, where are you taking me?" I crossed my ankles.  Real ladies don't cross their legs. Then again, do real ladies uncross theirs, then shake their bottom in a bearded face? A question for a modern Socrates if there ever was one.  Joe smiled. "It's a surprise." he said.  I realized then that Joe Normal had dimples. How had I missed that before? It made him a bit out of the ordinary. Oh, well.  I decided if he was free of lower body peircings, I wouldn't fault him the dimples.  Dimples! Why in the name of Aunt Susie's fuzzy navel, was I stuck on the dimples?  I realized I was starting to like Joe already, and it was only 8:30... too soon for attachment.  Sometimes these things go off schedual. I reminded myself. It's happened before you know. Liking the guy before he made it to your room. You still went through with it.  True. I did, but it was hard.  Joe pulled into a parking lot then barely stopped before turning off the engine, jumping out of the car, and swinging open my door.  "I felt like I was on a date with the Tazmanian Devil for a minute there! I really..."  I didn't finish my thought. I suddenly didn't even have a thought in my head. I'd just realized where this bozo had taken me!  He must have seen something in my face. "What? You don't like Putt-Putt? Thought we'd put in a couple of games then catch a movie.  You hungry? They have great foot longs here!"  I stopped him and reached into the car. To think I'd almost forgotten my purse!  I followed Joe into the swinging double doors of what appeared to be an emaciated zoo and took a seat in the nearest booth.  "What can I get for you?" a waiter in a green T-shirt and cut-offs asked between smacks of chewing gum.  "There's no chance you have anything stronger than a Mr. Pibb is there?" I asked.  "You can get a pitcher of beer if you have an I.D."  Beer! Yuck! The last time I'd guzzled that crap, I woke up in a pool of urine and vomit that I was sure had to taste better than the liquid that got me there.  Just then a kid threw a rubber ball across the room and smacked me in the side of the head.  I dug in my purse for the I.D. "Make that TWO pitchers." I said
