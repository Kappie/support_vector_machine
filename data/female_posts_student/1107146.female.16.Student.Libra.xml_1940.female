Let's see, she played a little serial killer women, a young jewish girl, an insane cook, and some other things that are too hard to describe.  The amazing thing is, that all of her characters seem exactly the same.   AND we're doing Guys and Dolls for the musical, and guess what?  In my hallway eves dropping it has been determined that MC will play Sarah and Anne-Marie will play Adalaine.  Yeh, so basically, the two leads.  Whats the point in even attempting? Wahoo, makeup here I come.
