Because I am moving, I also have to get everything I have at my moms house also, which is quite a lot since I spent more time there. Anyway, I have to get all of my stuff on to a sort of cargo truck type car. This is taking me forever and I am going to still be packing well through the week. I leave next Monday, Ian said he was going to come down on Sunday and see me so I hope he does. Now I have to continue packing, away I go.
