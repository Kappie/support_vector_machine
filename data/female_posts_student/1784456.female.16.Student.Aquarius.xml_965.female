Preferable soft and squish and doesn't complain or hit back.) Ahh, stress ball? Stressed?! I'm not stressed! WHO SAID STRESSED!!! (Err... shut up?) Ok, ok, sorry getting a little bit ... annoyed. Hehe, got youuu! Mmm... pre-school again! Well, I'm acting that age! Wow, aren't I gonna have fun attempting GCSE's? Any way where is every one?
