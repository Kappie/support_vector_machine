I didnt know whether to give her one of my page of notes or not. I ended up not giving her one coz i really want to go well in science this year coz bith my parents majoured in it. Ahhhh! I feel bad now. What would u do? Sorry gem.  N e ways, Mrs cenzie is late....yes! Everyone is blogging. lol. It was soo weird last night. I was in the shower, and i heard my nanna singing! I was sooo confused coz she lives in melbourne. I started to panic coz i thought i was hallucinating and also my nanna had a dream she saw my aunty die, the next morning she got a call from the police saying that shehad a drug overdose. I was scared the same thing was happening to me! I wrapped a towel aroung myself and went to the door. I looked outside and know one was there. Both my parents and bro were still at squash, i swear i heard her. It had her exact voice, coz i know how she sings off by heart coz she used to sing the song to me. It is all fine though. Pop would've called if sum thing was wrong.  N e way, my friend Jacki had a baby last night! I am soo excited! She had a Caesar but everything else went absolutely fine. Thankyou Lord. Thankyou with blessing her with a baby. Unfortunately i do not yet know what sex it is. I hope she had a girl. Boys are cuter but she would absolutely love dressing a girl up and stuff! Congratulations to Chris and Jacki! Yay!~ I can't stop blabbering on about it! Yes, well Mrs. Mcenzie still isnt here luckily.  Omg! I am sooo excited bout the winter sleepout tonight! It is gonna be sooo much fun being bums! Doing Bummy things...the joy is overwhelming! I am gonna freeze though. But it'll all b cool. Doubt anyone'll get to sleep. Ehxcelllennnt...  Freeze Frame! Random! I thought i saw a ball fly across the window. TaTa 4 now-kc
