And then I remember I still play with mine when I'm bored. So I guess you nailed it.   And you do illustrate a good point. We are the only two classifiable males on this whole damn thing (me probably being more estrogen than androgen, but let's not get into that). That's pretty cool/sad. Not really sad. Just sort of odd. Eh.  In times of doubt...say, "eh". Halleujah! Welcome home Will E.
