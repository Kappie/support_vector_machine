Apparently, the word from my mother (not to mention the Weather Channel) is that it is a rather dreary day, so perhaps the celebration will not be as big as it usually is.  I was never much into the revelry of it; I just liked to have another day off of school.  But I live here now, and in the library I sit, aiming for another productive day.  Oh, and for those who are keeping the weather score, here it is snowing.  But it's not sticking, and this is the kind of snow I can really get behind, so that's cool.  And it's not like I have to be outside in it.
