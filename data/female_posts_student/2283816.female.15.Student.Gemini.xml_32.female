I don't know what I'll do all day. Oooh, Abby's on! Yay!  I'd rather watch a movie than read a book. Maybe I can go with somebody to see The Stepford Wives or something. I kinda want to see it. I made a big list of Movies to See.   This had better not be a boring day...  Oh, yeah! Mattie Stepanak died! I felt so terrible because I've seen him on Oprah and I just checked out his book from the library! It was just sad.... he seems like just a beautiful person. Or seemed. But that sounds so depressing.   I have two fanfics in the works. One, a Fiddler on the Roof alternate universe and two, a Harry/Hermione/Ron triangle fic. The second one is probably going to be incredibly long and tangled and confusing, if it's anything how I would like it to be.
