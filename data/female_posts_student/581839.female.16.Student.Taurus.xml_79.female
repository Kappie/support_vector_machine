The one that you embarrased yourself in front of? I hear that you are not excited to come home and see me. It is so sad. I love you so much, and i miss you so much, and i know that i am a careless necessity that you must talk to once a month to please her. like someone in prison or something. yeah. i'll see you soon my little chiquita bannana.   girls camp was awesome. yeah, but i have to go. bed or something like that.
