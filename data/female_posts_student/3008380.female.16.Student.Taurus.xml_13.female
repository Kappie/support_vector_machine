In a row, I've watched WildBoyz, Jackass, i Want A Famous Face, Room Raiders, and Room Raiders. Now I'm probably going to watch another episode of Room Raiders. Wow.  But yeah, I'm bored. Not that I haven't told you already. I have only changed out of my pajamas once in the past three days. Sick, huh? Oh well, I'm comfy.  Oh it's not Room Raiders, it's Advance Warning. Whatever the fuck that is.
