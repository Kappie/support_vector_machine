My team didn't do so well in the second and third games (scores were 4-0 for both games).  It was totally possible to beat both teams, however, I think our team just didn't give it our all, especially for the last game.  I ended up injuring my left ankle (argh!) while challenging for the ball, and am currently limping now.  :(  *Boo hoo!*
