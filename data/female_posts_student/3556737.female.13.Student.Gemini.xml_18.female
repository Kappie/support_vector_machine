"i will not ride the rock o plane anymore". it killed me. well, not really killed me, but it, i don't know, it changed me life. now i don't want to ride any of the carnival rides anymore. i don't want rock o plane, no more. like spider man2, "i want to have my own life, not spiderman, no more". L.O.L. my brother even said "it's like gonna make your stomach fly". and i said, "it's like gonna cut your body in half". and my dad said, "that's the purpose of the carnival. it make you feel like s..t".but i don't think i will have a wonderful July 4th. goodnight!
