That happened to me all week! Oh well, i would like to give a shoutout to Liz Whiting that i love her to death and i'm sorry what i said about the shower, lol!!!  Today, i would like to wish great luck to my Dallas Stars as they take on Chicago for the second time consecutively and i hope they win.  Again, today i did absolutely nothing and i listened to burned cd's all day.  Oh yeah, i had to look over my few words in finnish that Siru gave me to learn because she still wants me to be trilingual in finnish.  Meh, i try.  5 MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!! yaaaaay! For Christmas, i'm staying home, with my family, watching my annual tradition christmas movies such as "A Muppet's Christmas Carol" and "A Diva's Christmas Carol" and then i'm watching the hockey games all Christmas Break.  Don't forget New Year's Eve where i will be partying it down with my friends while watching Dallas go against Montreal.  I have tickets to that game too, but i don't know if me or my parents are going.  I took this quiz today that was how pure you are....i'm 86% pure! woooo!  Then i took this Pregnancy quiz thing......it says i'm going to have 4 kids after i get married, over my dead body i will!  Then i took a slut test that said i was 45% slut.....which i don't really understand but whatever.  Oh yeah, in other news, the forces in Iraq found Saddam Hussein.....whoop-de-doo, now we can waste more money putting him on trial and prolonging this "war" in iraq.  oh joy.    Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S.- Me and Brittany are going to be in the hockey section of the yearbook!!!!!  because we were cheering!!! we have quotes and everything!!  yaaaay! our work has paid off, hurrah.
