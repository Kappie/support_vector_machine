While in there i picked up a couple books that looked good. The first was calles 'The Book of Dead Days' by Marcus Sedgwick. And i have to say it was a VERY good read. Im ususally not into this type of book but this was one of thoes ones where i judged it on its cover adn hit gold. Its set in a huge old, derelict metropolis where a 15yr old boy named Boy lives and workes for this magician who has a show in the poorer part of town. After a few strange murgers, the boy and his new friend Willow, get summoned by the wizard to do a whole wack of crazy things (think grave robbing, crazy doctor Jeckyl/Hyde things, and insane undergrown mazes). Anyways, im not going to give away the ending in case anyoen decides to read the above mentioned book. But its really good, i read it waaay into the weeee hours of the night. But sadly, with my bad memory and not leaving myself time to absorb the book. ive kinda forgot the begining (most of the explanation came from the back of the book :P).    Well seeing as how its 1:36 pm and im still in my jammies, i have to go.     xox leslee
