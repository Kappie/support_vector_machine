The sun's usually out, the little children flock to my house to play with my little bro's gamecube, they're knock on my door to try and get me to wake up so I can then kill them one by one. Parents: don't send your kids over to my house. They might not come back in one piece. I've set up my little Jayne-fort in the computer room, in a desperate attempt to get away from them. And of course, the computer chooses now of all times to be retarded. I should be able to listen to Linkin Park and type this blog without being interrupted by popups that ask me, "Who is this pop diva?" I don't CARE who it is! But if I close this popup, then the computer will go on a full-scale alert, kinda like the CIA whenever Bush comes around to visit (j/k military intelligence fans!) and decide to freeze up. And every time it does this, I have to RESTART on this stupid blog that complains about it. The horrible cycle. I've realized that I could probably alleviate this problem by NOT listening to LaunchRadio, but Jet is just too addicting.   Once upon a time, there were no popups and everyone lived in a state of bliss. Then, some evil entreprenuer decided, "hey, let's make life miserable by freezing all the computers and interrupting whatever makes these people happy! That way, they'll buy our products. Products like, 'the alternative to plastic surgery!'" And so it came to pass that the land of high speed internet was plagued by evil unclosable, unstopable, titanium-coated popups. And the popup stopper could do nothing! And the people despaired. (someone, think up a happy ending!)
