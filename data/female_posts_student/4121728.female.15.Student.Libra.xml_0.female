After a long and a very interesting day, i finally reached home... i'm exhausted. i didn't get used to the idea of waking up early just to write a letter, so that i have a gift. Well, yeah... i didn't have the chance to buy my guy a gift so that's why i just gave him a letter. One stupid letter. But nonetheless, he liked it anyway. Nyahaha!          Meet the parents.      I was kinda mortified and beyond shocked at first when he said that we were going to his house to eat... and to meet his parents. Yeah, i met his mom last summer when we watched Aga Muhlach and Kristine Hermosa's   All My Life   and that had been kinda vague since i just waved and then left since i had to get to the bathroom and pee! and now was the actual show... and i was really not ready for it! Good thing i wasn't having PMS or i would have died right then and there! His parents were superb. Well, at least they were nice to me... and a few of his relatives (and his parents' friends) were there too... and they were all teasing us. Damn adults! just kidding! of course i was flattered. who wouldn't be?!  DUH!              Freakin' Tests.     Our exams are coming up and i didn't even get the chance to study! Well, how can i when all i was thinking about is "what the hell would i give him?". So you guys, you wish me luck okay because i really need it!
