I've been reading, writing, thinking about a certain person and all of the other things I seem to spend countless hours doing...I saw Spider-Man 2 yesterday, and I thought it was pretty good. The way it was filmed and some of the little things that were included for pure entertainment made it in some ways better than the first, but the ending was kind of...meh. You know?? I got a ben and jerry's cherry garcia bar to eat there and that was really delicious. *Hee hee! Hawksley Workman!* -inside joke with myself!- So,y eah that was good. I'm planning my birthday party too...it's kind of a lot later than my actual birthday but, whatever. I'm currently obsessed with The Spill Canvas, and this Dashboard Confessional song called Screaming Infidelites that I'm sure everyone knows...Oh, God...I'm getting into all this sentimental, acoustic-y stuff!! AHHHHH! Hee hee...sudden bursts of hyperness...I'm also into The Prize Fight, Northstar, The Juliana Theory (as I've probably mentioned!!), The Starting Line, and With Broken Wings. I actually named this blog after one of their songs. It's such a bad emo-ish title for a blog but I seriously ran out of ideas and it started playing on I-tunes, and I was like, "Hey! How about Sympathy Page?!" Yeah so I'll stop rambling now...Except, I need to post this one poem that I actually like up here. Oh, and I'm still waiting for Revolutions on Canvas to come...shipping is so slow!! Oh well, I'm shutting up...
