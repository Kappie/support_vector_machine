Where'd my angel go? Where's that little guardian that sits about spending his day making sure I don't cross the street and get hit by a car... get attacked by psycho killers in the middle of the night... protects me from the demons in my mind.... from heartache.. hearbreak and the devils of love...          Michael used to have his moments... We used to sit outside in his backyard at night... and mind you I was probably only 11 or 12 at the time.. right after Mom died.. It was a play off his name for me... though I'm sure his Mother chose the name very carefully (she's rather religious).. I used to tell him he was my Guardian Angel.. he made me feel safe and protected from all harm... and of course... Michael being Michael he would laugh and tease.. "I'm not only your Guardian Angel princess, I am -the- angel. You don't get any better than me darling." ... Very Michael-ish no?          I have no idea why I remember that...          The only thing Michael couldn't protect me from was Michael...          Sweet irony... oh how I loathe you.. (I'm in a melodramatic mood... ignore me)           I do not believe there is one thing in this universe that is more complicated than love.. alright.. save Math.. if I can fail at Math.. I can certainly fail at love... There are so many types of love... sibling love.. family love.. friendly love.. passionate love.. love for ones neighbor.. ones country... and hell.. for all we know in a decade for ones planet or universe.. love for ones God...          You can love a friend as if they are your brother or sister.. or you can love a friend as they may also be your lvoer... your Father or Mother could be your best friend... your neighbor could be the confiding force you need to keep going through the years... Pride and love for your country gives you a sense of belonging... but so does your family.. your friends.. your community.           Furthermore the universal symbol for love is the heart... Now... considering I failed the part in bio where we discussed the human heart... I suppose it probably is fitting.. its just as damned confusing... illogical.. logic belongs to the brain.          So why do the brain and the heart compete so much over matters of love?          I've stopped making sense.. I'm going to go hide..          Yes.. I certainly am a writer at heart... err.. in mind... it runs in my veins! There!
