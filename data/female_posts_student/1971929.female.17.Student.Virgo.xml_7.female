After trying the whole movie to hold back my emotions, I let he rivers of tears stream down my face when they're finally together at last. Oh, it was such a great movie; the best movie I think I've ever seen. I cannot express how great this movie was. Of course, don't go see it just because I say it's tremendous. Everyone has their own opinion, but mine is that this is the best movie ever. Everything was excellent: the acting, the actors they chose, the plotline, the ending, the script. I couldn't have imagined a better movie. I don't think I've ever wanted to burst out into tear so much in my life. It was so wonderful, I just can't stop raving about it. In my eyes, it's the greatest movie of all time. I'm going to buy it on video as soon as it comes out and watch it all the freakin' time, because I'm in love with it. Oh... I clench my heart as my eyes swell up with tears.
