       
      I am weary.  The long, languid days of August have coated me thickly, nearly smothering me with their weight. And now I trudge along under this burden of days, dripping with honeyed illusions. The last days of summer roll out from beneath me and tumble along like water o'er a mill. Some days pass swiftly and vigourously, laden with youthful virility and impulsion. Others slow to nearly a standstill, with naught but necessity keeping them from a halt.  Now autumn is at bay, and before or after we are ready, but always when we are not prepared, the chill winds signifying the passing of the seasons slip through the web of summer. The leaves shall die away in their glorious coats of red and gold, and our minds will turn to harvests and cider. But ere long, in our minds, the chill turns to cold and we grow tired of autumn. And then, then! we will look back on these summer days with regret and desire. For we are simple minded, and little remains in our high esteem for long.  We cannot and would not keep the wheel of change from turning. We cannot force it to spin faster, though we always try. We are caught in an endless and eternal cycle of death and re-birth, of the passing of the seasons, of change.
