Sometimes have the most uncontrollable rage, it surprises me. I should probably just tell people when they piss me off, but it's too hard. I'm too worried about hurting people's feelings until I snap at them and say really snotty things. So I've decided to go back to bed and get caught up on my reading, so as to avoid my negative emotions. Hmm.
