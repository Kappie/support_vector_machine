I've just been scouring the net for pictures of InMe. Joe Morgan is sooo fine! I did this compatibility test, and it's 91% compatibility.  It's only 60 something % with Elliott, but our horoscopes say 95%, and that we're like soulmates, so screw the little name thingy.   I have sooo failed this German exam.  It was horrible!  It said, "Sonne," somewhere, and after that I had the Rammstein song on my mind.  I HATE that song - it freaks the hell out of me! But anyway, I was totally distracted, and I haven't got a flippin' clue what Sonne means anyway.  Me thinks I may have got that section entirely wrong ...  Wowow!  Tomorrow morning, looadsa fifth years will be in our formroom! *Squee!* Any volunteers to help Andy revise? ;)  (Oh my God, Pooj! Remember that time when he asked us if we could help him with his homework?  How much would you take him up on that now?!)  We did drugs today!  We did weed and ecstasy and heroin and we were going to do magic mushrooms but we ran out of time.  Lol. I was Jools Magic Mushrooms.  Dan was Jim Weed. Sam was Fred Grass.  Pooj was Pooj Speed.  That was so random, actually.  And someone with an accent like that should NOT be called Stacy.  Or Staysay.  Her top was absolutely gorgeous, though.  All black and lacey ... wow, I want it.  Okay, you search InMe on Google, and you get a picture of a very fluffy dog called Saara.  Well that's just darn tootin', isn't it.  Ooh *wipes tear from eye* today was probably the last day I'll ever see the U6.  No more, no more *cries pathetically*.  At least it's only Boxy who's really gonna be hit hard.  She's reeeally fancies Hilly.  Actually, so does half the third year.  They are sooo pathetic.  I mean, yeah, I know Elliott has Home Ec. 4th period on Tuesdays, but they have posters of Hilly.  I kid you not.  Gawd knows how they got them.  Right, there is something strange going on between Adam and Richard Baldwin, so I have to focus my full attention on what is going on there ... Richard just spent ten minutes confusing me about Homer Simpson.  What a weirdo.  I shall leave you with words of wisdom from Homer.  (This is what started the whole confusion.)  "Le grille! What the hell is that?!"  Lool.  Ciaow! *~Jools~* Mwah
