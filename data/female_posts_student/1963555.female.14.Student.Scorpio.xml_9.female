Oh except my stupid French teacher is so retarded I could kick him in the face and it would take him a week to notice the brusy pain! Whoa..... that was outta character! anyway when I got home from school it was raining and i went inside, but like a 1/2 hr later I got an urge to just go out in the rain and stand there... so I did. It was awesome.... I just stood there while it rained then it started down pouring even harder I sat there until my hair was soaking wet and my butt was drenched(about 5 or 10 mins). It was really thereputic. Then I went inside freezing from the A/C and changed. Then I put on a warm fall sweater (oh yeah.... 1st day of fall today!!!) and warmed some Apple Cider and currled up on the couch watching Dedicate Live on Fuse. Then to make everything better Simple Plan -Addictied came on! It was awesome. So Dacia, my best friend (her pg. is....  Thatsnotcool.blogspot.com) has her boyfriend Adam over right now........ yeah anyway I'm still sorry about the whole almond joy thing but she makes me feel like crap alot too. I dunno just forget it....... bye
