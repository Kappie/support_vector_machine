After 4 months of dealing with GRE bureaucratic red tape, they approved of me having extra time due to my learning disability.  After having my psychiatrist re-write my letter 3 times, jumping over UT hurdles, and calling New Jersey long distance, this nightmare is fianlly over with.  I have no clue how I got a rejection letter a few days ago, when in reality they had already approved my request.  The only thing I can think of is that my final documentation got shuffled around and filed in the wrong place.  Kayte was right: if I've passed UT's bureaucratic mess (which seems to be more difficult than even that of the IRS), there is no reason why I shouldn't pass GRE standards.  AND I also called Tulane Grad School today, and was pleasantly surprised to hear that as long as all the other materials were in with my application (rec letters, main app, transcript, ect.), I could have my GRE scores sent in a little later.  The only thing they would need to know is that they were on the way.  Opa also offered to pay for an extra month of online GRE study.  God bless him.  So now, I have until January 7th to study.  A huge weight has been lifted off of my soldiers.  Prayer really does help.  Now I can relax, and concentrate on GRADUATING IN 3 DAYS!!! :-D
