Flames lost today but whatev, the fight Iginla had was entertaining to watch and made up for their boring loss.  I keep eating like all the food in the damn house.  Maybe cause it seems to make up for all the damn feelings I have.  You know I do want to loose more weight, but then once I loose some I decide I am happy the way I am.  So then I eat what I want and then I get scared that I am going to gain weight.  I don't want to say I am obsessed, but really I think that is closer to the truth.  I weight myself AT LEAST 3 times on weekdays and AT LEAST 5 times a day during weekends.  I can't stop.  And my mom always buys a whole bunch of food that I really don't need and well I always go out to eat.  Actually now that I think of it, Thursday I went to Boston Pizza, Friday I went to moxie's before rehearsal (I have lots to say about how the play is going so far) and it's my Dad's b-day on Monday but he won't be in town because he is flying back to Vancouver so I am also going out to eat tonight.  Not to mention that I ate practically anything and everything that has the word 'chocolate' in it in my freezer, we also had like ten thousand doughnuts during rehearsal on Friday.  So I would have the say that the play is like the highlight of my life right now.  I honestly wish I had signed for Soccer or something.  I miss playing it all the time and I am always stuck inside my lonely boring house.  I feel so anti-social like I have no friends.  I need to do something active - NEED...!  *Not a want* My mom is always working and every time that my dad flys in from Vancouver he always goes to Ben and Melissa's to work on their new house.  I feel so abandoned if you know what I mean.  I know my parents do love me, but they never have any time for anything.  No time to just talk and stuff.  I even have some doubts about who are really my friends.  You know during the Thursday of TAPS (by the way I made honors W. Distinction cause I worked my ass off) well see I have invited everyone but Travis to my house for lunch (Trav and I got in a fight therefore I didn't invite him) and so at first they were all like "yeah we will come" and then strangely the only people who came over were Chels and Sarah.  I mean I was glad that I didn't have to cook and clean as much but that really makes me wonder.  What was more important than me.  Apparently they were going to go to Extreme Pita for lunch.  That makes no sense.  I mean I have the vehicle and I could of driven them all and lunch would have been free.  That makes me feel like Chels and Sarah are my only true older friends.  I am becoming much closer to those that came from other J.H. schools then the one I came.  I feel as though older friends aren't so much like the people I would most likely be lifelong friends with.  Infact I still keep in touch with Brit that goes to Scarlett and well Megz and I declared that we will rule in Drama-Queenism 4ev :) and well I like Lindsey, Allyse, Margaret, Maria, Jess, Brit, Kenda, Bianca, Kirrie, Palavi, Erin, Kristen, and even Carli, Alison, and Jason and so many more people.  I mean I still like my old friends (most of them) because I have known them for so long but I think I am a very different person.  I don't really enjoy lunch hours with them either.  It's not fun or cool, it's just boring and I honestly find them immature.  I feel that I am like ten steps above em.  I mean Ash is nice, but honestly sometimes acts and dresses like more of guy.  By all means though that is just her so I can't really change that, but I think Ash and I will be really good friends for a long time because we both thrive off of cheering the Flames and thriving off Soccer.  Of course Chels and I forever will be friends, I mean that is a given.  I saw her at Safeway this morning and actually gave her a ride home.  And well possibly friends with Sarah.  I do like the rest of the people but I feel as though as high School progresses we are just growing more apart and more now than ever we seem very different.  Ah yes I also forgot (don't know how I could forget this but I did) what Leonard said to me about Bio.  You know maybe that is why I am like beating myself up for doing bad on it.  Well first of all I DO feel stupid because it was suppose to be like the easiest unit and like it was my worst.  That is also why it was so difficult to ask is she could go over it with me sometime, but I know that if I know now what I did wrong then I won't make the same mistake and if I want to make a career out of Bio I have to take it very seriously.  So anyways Leonard walks into T.A. one day and I was just looking over some Bio before the test and he was like "What are you doing" and I was like "Just reviewing my Bio so I don't screw anything up and I really want to do good on the test."  Then he went ahead and said "OMG I can't believe your actually going over that stuff, it's so easy, it's stuff that they talk about on The Magic School Bus."  I was so hurt by the comment, actually it still disturbs me because I remember it so damn well.  I've heard it before 'Don't listen to those kind of people' but how do you just "not-listen."  It's like everytime I find something hard or difficult that most people find easy everyone has to condemn me and make me feel so low.  It's not a very good feeling quite honestly.  I actually remember what Ms. LaCour said to me way back when I was reviewing for the Chem final.  She started off by saying "You have done so good" but we both know that I failed ALOT of things, so I was like "Well I failed a lot, I don't exactly consider that good" and then she said "Yeah but your work ethic is amazing."  That was the first time I felt that something she said truly and deeply came from the heart.  Sometimes being smart isn't everything and sometimes people who have to work for things work so hard that whatever their goals are, they always seem to accomplish them one way or another.  I am sure there is so much more that has happened over the past Spring Break and then some, but I guess if I don't remember the rest than it doesn't really affect me too much.  For Active Living Off Campus we went top rope climbing one day which I honestly hope I don't have to do again because heights scare the living day lights out of me.  One day we also went to archery (sp??) which was neat to try but no something I would probably even do again.  I think I will stick to being the amazing soccer player that I am, I don't have 14 medals for nothing.  Oh yeah I also forgot about the play.  I guess it's going really well.  We sold a lot of tickets already, but not everyone has their lines down pat so that is a little frightening since we start full runs at the end of next week and Wednesday we start the late night rehearsals for we go from 4:00 PM - 7:30 PM.  My entire life is going to be Drama - literally.  He expects so much too.  And well I honestly wish I had more lines in the play, but like I am a faerie so I dance a lot but dance ain't really my thing.  I think I am a better actress than dancer but you know what, if he cast me as a faerie then he must have belief in me for that part.  I have belief and confidence in myself too.  Friday's rehearsal never seemed to end though and I was so energy drained afterwards.  After Megz, Kirrie, and I went to Moxies for lunch we walked back to the school cause Friday rehearsals begin at 2:30 PM.  Then we rehearsed til like 6:10 PM or maybe even a bit later.  It was a LONG LONG night but I still once everything comes together it will be amazing.  All of our hard work and effort is bound to pay off.  I just really hope that everything with Drama and stuff doesn't interfere with my other classes *cough* Bio cause doing good in Bio is higher on my list and things that mean ALOT to me.  My goals, my dreams they are everything to me.  I cannot image doing anything else but teaching.  It is my passion.  ok anyways getting slightly off-topic yeah I just really hope the play goes well and well with the amout of work, time, and effort we are putting it it should be a good show.  Though in May I have so many things coming up.  There is:  May 1: Melissa's Mount Royal Grad Dinner May 5-7: High School Drama Festival  Rehearsal (Miss School those days) May 8: Weekend Rehearsal to make sure we are prepared May 10: Showing of a Mid Summer Night's Dream to J.H. Drama classes (Miss afternoon classes) May 11-14: Mid Summer Night's Dream Showings (No life for four nights but Drama) May 18: Drama performances at Father Whelihan (Miss afternoon classes) May 29: Melissa's Wedding  Ok wow, busy huh??  And between all that I some how have to fit time in for rehearsals for the play, and doing homework and studying.  When my dad comes in another weekend he is also taking me a whole bunch of places because we are looking for a car to buy me.  I think most of the things I need to get off my chest are free now.
