The sucky thing about it was that my sis was stuck in NC. (Our car broke down and we had no way to get her) And my mom has refused to see us. She also spent all of the Christmas money, so we had no money for presents or food or anything.  I scraped together some potatoes and made a casserole and my bro and I set the table all Christmasy. We all realized there are ALOT of people who had Christmas much worse than we, so we decided not to mope and be cry babies. LOL  I hope y'all had a great holiday! HAPPY 2001!!!!!!
