And its weird songs too like that retro stuff and old foggie kinda songs. It ranges from  Oops I did it again  to    Oh Danny Boy  to  I'll Fly Away!  It's crazy and kinda disturbing... Oh and when I'm talkin to myself if I don't watch it I'll start singing what i just said makin up my own song. It's not normal! I mean I can understand talking to yourself but coming up with songs about the conversations with yourself.... well thats just plumscary!
