I come home and call my dad back because my mom said he had called and then he was like "well i just want to let you know that you can keep the valentine because the fact that it took over 2 weeks to get it to me means u must not give a damn about me" well damn that u bitch!!!!! THE FACT THAT WE FUCKING GOT YOU SOMETHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH, U DONT LIKE IT?! SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS!!!! then i hang up on him, he decides to call back  then it gets good  I tell my mom to pick it up and he askes for me again and i say "mom no im not talking to him" and she told me that he was fine, so i talked to him and HE HAS THE NERVE TO TELL ME "IF YOU EVER HANG UP ON ME AGAIN...BLAH BLAH" im crying by that time and i yell at him back saying "OKAY WELL U HUNG UP ON ME 1ST SO I HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE MAD AND IT WASNT EVEN MY FAULT AMANDA DIDNT GIVE U THE VALENTINE" ohhh yall are probably laughing by now...the ass gets mad over a goddamn valentine...surprise surprise!!! So as my dad is still bitching at me i shove the phone at my mom and run away crying because i was so pissed and am still so pissed for what he did, then my divorced parents started yelling at each other and my dad decides that hes not gonna yell at amanda, but that hes going to yell at me! ME!!! FUCK!!!!!!!!!! i hope he reads this because he has no idea how mad i am at him and maybe i shouldnt give a rats ass about him because he shoulda been happy that we even fucking got him something, if hes gonna get all bitchy over some fucking chocolates then he can just screw off. sorry but im sooo not kidding, just because parents are well..adults *sometimes immature i might add* i have all the right to do the kicking and screaming shit too.   Then he goes "You can keep the chocolates and eat them" haha u know what...i feel like putting that peice of shit down the garbage disposal..the end of my crappy pathetic, shitty ass life....I HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED!!!!
