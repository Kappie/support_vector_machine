Today         I got up at 10:30 and watched some TV with nateman.....We kinda picked up the house a lil bit and then we went swimming for like 2 and a half hours then we came home and picked up some more.  I took a bath and picked up my room then I started gettin ready....I talked to jess and she asked me to go to the scrimmage with her so I did....We got there and it was cold as crap so we left and got TB to eat to try to warm us up *:)* and then we came back and went back in the stadium to go to the bathroom, then we sat in the car for a lil while and left when the scrimmage was over...we rode by the square once and then I took her home....After that I came home and got moms phone and left again.  I met jana, chelsea, meredith and justin.  Meredith wanted me to take her around once in my car so we did and then I realized I didn't have hardly any gas so she rode with me to the gas station which was an ordeal b/c she saw nic there! lol...it was quite funny actually...on the way back we met jana and chels and justin at the bank to drop mer off so she could take justin home and then we all rode back to the square and jonathan was in front of me when i got on the square so i pulled in to talk to him and then i told him to pull in over on the other side and we did and i got out and gave him a hug...he told me some INTERESTING news and then I left b/c it was almost my curfew!! now im home and the boys are over here playing cards...who'd a thunk it!
