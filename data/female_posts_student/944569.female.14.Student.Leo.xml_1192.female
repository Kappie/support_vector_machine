I mean, it's always been my dream to become an author at the age of 13.  From: Jack Prowl()  Very delightful story you have going so far. I am the editor of a the "Start Off Authors" company, maybe you've heard of me? Anyway, I think you're story was very original and contained a lot of depth into what you write, congratulations on a nice begining to (if you are planning to go that far) an outstanding fiction. If you want your writing to maybe go somewhere, you can contact me at Start Off Authors Inc., Editorial section 895883, London Ontario, Canada
