I have a plan with Heather and Brianna to kick some butt, some bitch butt. We hate her. She's a hoe. Also, I hate it when people flirt with the guy that I like when they know that I like him. It's gay. I had some good convos with some cool people today. (if you know what I mean) So I actually kinda don't mind school anymore. Crazy huh? Carol's here and Emily's looking through last year's year book to try and figure out who I like. I'm going to let Carol talk in here now.  So here's Carol: sup alll ya'all out theres!!just chillin w my peeps you know!! yeah i was kinda crazy today my personal property was violated by a couple of freshman (and no not that kind of property)lol anyways yeah i need to find someone i think i should take out an add in the paper white female 16 looking for a person to chill with have fun has to be somewhat good looking nice smile likes music is funny and likes giraffes!   So that's all for now. What to do today? I don't know. Any suggestions?? lol If only I had that certain boy here. Cause he's a hottie with one of the best bodies I've ever seen. And Carol agrees.   Emily still can't figure out who it is.  Carol's choice of song today: [Big Yellow Taxi by Counting Crows and Vanessa Carlton]  [Adam Duritz] They paved paradise and put up a parking lot With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot Don't it always seem to go    That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone   They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  [Vanessa Carlton] Ooooh, bop bop bop Ooooh, bop bop bop  [Adam] They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them No, no, no Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone   They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot  [Vanessa] Ooooh, bop bop bop Ooooh, bop bop bop  [Adam] Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT I don't care about spots on my apples, Leave me the birds and the bees Please Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone   They paved paradise and put up a parking lot Hey now, they paved paradise to put up a parking lot Why not?
