The stupid things that people do continue to ASTOUND me!  my good ol' hubby... yep the bastard himself, is up to his old tricks... too bad i am not around to be amazed by them, eh?  here is a copy of his amazingly poignant email...   hey you could have called me and told me you where not going to bring sky down for easter that 2 holidays i missed with you and him    ::tear::  are those violins i hear playing in the background?
