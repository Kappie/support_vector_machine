I like having them done but I just don' t need the extra thing to take care of nor do I want to spend $40+ per month to have someone fuck them up.  I'm kinda pissed because the other day I burned 5 copies of my SIME favorites CD that I'm going to send out and when I tried to burn a 6th copy this morning it said that some of the songs wouldn't fit on the CD.  I will probably have to go and drag each individual song into the Windows Media Player so that they will all fit because when I was trying to do it this morning (in a hurry because I want to mail those things today) it wouldn't work.  I'll probably end up mailing them tomorrow.  We tried to shampoo the living room carpets last night but Debby's machine is a piece of shit and didn't do much.  The carpet does look better, but it's nowhere near as clean as it should be.  Todd's off today and he might fuck with it some more.  Fuck.  Class started.
