So they called my name and I stood by that sheety thing and he was like "smile and look at the lens" and I was like "Right...mwahhahaha!" So I made the BEST face ever it was like a shocked kinda look. It's hard to explain. I like made me eyes go really big. But then the picture taking guy was like "I don't think you will like this picture.." and he deleted it and made me re take my photo! I was like "I want to be ugly! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?!?" So then for my new picture he made me smile so I look normal.   *sigh*  Looking normal is overrated.
