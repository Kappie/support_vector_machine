After leaving good old mount airy, we drove to Piegon Forge and Gatlinberg, TN which is this tourist area, it's cool though, i gotta admitt. Dad and i rode this sky lift, which is just bascially a ski lift up and down the mountain. that was a lot of fun. Then we went and i got homemade chocolate covered cherries!! OMG my fave!!! haha and we went to the Rippley's aquirum. You get to go through this underwater tunnel and look at all the sharks and fish and stuff. I played with a King Crab haha i got crabs!! and pet a sting ray. lol very intresting. We stayed in this hotel, which was really nice, hot tubs...yay!! but i didnt get in. I was too tired. haha This morning before leaving that town we went to a mall and i bought stuff at Tommy Hilfigure, Gap, Fossil and Old Navy. I got the cutest shoes at old navy!! haha thats all i got there. At Tommy i got this pink shirt and the coolest pink skirt i have EVER seen. At Fossil i got the coolest PINK watch ever!! it was the best $70 spent i think. At Gap i got some capris that are cute. We then ate and headed back the 4hrs to my dads house. We've been all over town, looking at the local univeristy and stuff like that. Tommorrow we're going to go see The Day After Tomorrow and sometime we're gonna go see Shrek 2. lol Theres lots to do here but i miss being back home with all my friends. My mom actually made me cry when i was leaving, i got in the car as i we started to back out of the drive way she mouthed "i love you" that brought tears to my eyes but i sucked it up. I also cried when i walked into my dads house and he had every picture, every card, everything i had ever made him all on his fridge and around his house. He's really excited him here. I never knew he held on to so much. Mine and the boys pictures are everywhere. Gotta love him.   aaron just informed me he wanted to get freaky in my jeep...i was telling him how i want a yellow jeep wrangler. haha ok aaron, whatever darlin. I told him he was "aaron ur so goofy" and he said "what if im not trying to be goofy..." whoa now, im scared!! haha stop laughing lauren, my luck, you prob arent...haha ok. so start laughing!! now stop!! i bet you didnt laugh that time either...i love u!!! haha
