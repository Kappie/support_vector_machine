I talked to Jesse today and it is sounding more and more like he wants me to come to El Paso to see him on his 4 day break before he sets off for the giant sandbox. He said that even though he knew it was going to be hard for him to let go he felt he needed to see me one last time before he had to go overseas. I told him the decision was all his and I would respect whatever he felt was right to do. I cant wait to see him though, i miss him so much. It will be so great to see him.
