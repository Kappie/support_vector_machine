It is my last day with my office mate as she is moving up to where all the cool people are. I will have a new one when I come back from Oklahoma but its just not the same. I also have a final this afternoon and have done little to no preparation for it. I guess its good that its open note open book. I have written the first six pages of my thesis although I am supposed to have 12. Oh well I don't care. I just am excited that I am going home! Or not home but to a new home. Its going to be totally strange. But that is my life right now. Not much cool going on but things will really pick up when I get back.
