I remember hearing it hit the curb and seeing it bounce, and slammed into my side. Then my car hit a concrete edge and flipped over into a 10-12ft ditch. I was screaming the whole time, it is the most scariest thing to live through. And the fact that I couldn't control it, that it was unavoidable freaks me out to no end. I'm just so thankful that I'm ok. When I got hit so many things ran through my mind, not that I was going to die, I knew I'd be fine, but just how to tell my parents and David, and how my car was ruined! While in the ambulance I had sort of a revelation, I laid there and I knew that God was watching over me ALOT and that I had to of had an angel with me. I know I'm lucky and this has just been a life changing experience for me. The only thing now, is I keep picturing the whole thing over and over again. I'm afraid that if I go to sleep I'll have to re-live it again, and that scares me the most.    I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep Cause I'd miss you, baby
