Woke up at 10:50 to the sound of what seemed like some asshole reving their car. But it just my dad pressure washing the house. Why? I don't know >_>;;. So I got up, dazed and confused and had a doughnut for breakfast [mmm, nutrition! ;)], because for some reason we had doughnuts. Then I evenually had a shower and got dressed. My mom told me that she would take me to Shoppers at 2:00 so that I could get somethings I had been meaning to. Two came and went so I went wandering in my backyard with Taf for a while and ended up lying under the pear tree with her, using her as my fuzzy pillow :3. It was nice. I almost fell asleep a few times during the twenty or so minutes I was relaxing. Then at 4 we finally left. I got my stuff and ended up getting a digital photography mag too. Cuz, well, why not? I also got this dexatrim natural stuff since I've been eatting like I pig latey :\. So hopefully that'll do some good. I want to walk to Aberdine and get something fuzzy to drink. And mebeh take pictures of the lamas :o Well, anyways, I should go because all of this sitting is making me feel jumpy and kinda twitchy... I need to go burn some energy >:D [Ha!] ..There's a small moth piledriving it's self against the screen >_>   listening to now : ' cherry lips' - garbage [yay for pretty boys :) *thumbs up*]
