I worked steadily all day on my history notes and still am not done.  I'll work tomorrow on them too I suppose.  Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.  We'll open our presents then because the Webers will all be over on Christmas Day.  Well maybe they won't.  Mom is really sick and may have Influenza A.  So Christmas is sorta up in the air at the moment.  Christmas Eve mass at church will be packed at 10.  It always is.  I better go to bed though because I have to get up early again tomorrow.  But before I go I have something else to say...  I ment to update yesterday because I had something really important to get off my mind but I fell asleep before I got the chance.  Yesterday, I was switching through the channels and I came across Oprah.  On the show she and her staff traveled to South Africa and gave a Christmas party to all the children orphaned by AIDS.  This was truly an emotional show.  I cried as I watched these children become so happy after receiving clothes, toys, food and shoes.  Those children are so much braver than I could ever be.  They have lived through so much in so many short years.  For some of them, it was their first Christmas, pair of shoes and photograph of themselves.  Oprah had a brief biography with a few of her guest and they nothing short of inspiring.  All I could think about was how I could help them.   Sitting there watching the television I just sat and wondered what I did to deserve what I have.  I know one thing...Whatever I get tomorrow night for Christmas, I don't deserve.  To everyone reading this, thank God right now for everything you have!
