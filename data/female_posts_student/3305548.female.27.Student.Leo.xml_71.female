Even with my awesome camera, some shots are hard to catch. Danick is very Springstein in this snap. It just works for him. I have to take a moment and note that I am passing these snaps along to ED's management to use for promotional or personal purposes. Thus, if you are not ED management...no touchie the piccys for public use. I will cover this in more detail above.  urlLink
