I can't say that I'm happy it's New Year's Eve, but I am in a good mood...perhaps despite the impending new year.  I have no explanation for this reaction at all.  I am only grateful that the gloom of last week is gone.  Sorry for my absence...I have been immersed in the world of Harry Potter (now in the 4th book...all I can say so far is...WOW), and been busy spending time with friends and family...lunch, movies ( Something's Gotta Give  is greatly funny and everyone should see it), football (Southern Miss, my dad's alma mater - and my sister's too, come to think of it - just lost to Utah in the Liberty Bowl), the works (played a great game called Scene-It - a must if you are into movies).  Hardly have had time for anything else...  Happy early New Year to all!
