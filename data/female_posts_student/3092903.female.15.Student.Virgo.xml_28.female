I did end up going shopping today, but I think I got a shirt that I dont like that much. Oh well, I'll wear it anyway maybe. I really liked this shirt that looks just like it at American Eagle, but it was $40. It was uber cute and probably worth it, because I ended up getting one almost exactly like it from Old Navy for $26.50. Yeah, i guess i'll keep it because I dont think Old Navy lets you return items. Its cool though. I watched The Assistant tonight. I love that show SO MUCH. Me and Sara called each other during every commercial break. It was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen. I want have Andy Dick's kids so bad just for the last name. Me and Sara have already named 4 of our 15 children we will have by him. (oh, and Say, the 5th one is "Amoeba"..hehehehehe). I have to work tomorrow. On Friday I had to babysit before the show and Emily was sick throwing up with a fever. So I hear she's still not feeling her best. I'mjust glad I didnt catch it with her right up under me all day. But after I get done at like 5:30, i've decided that I'm going to go out to eat with Sara and we're going table dancing. All I've got to say is..WE'RE FINDING BILLY DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whoa, I am so tired that I thought I jus saw a person running towards me out of the corner of my eye. Maybe I'm more tired than I think. But I am so going dancing soon. Something scandalous needs to happen lately. I'm not sure exactly what, actually I think i am exactly sure what. Yep, yep i am. Everyone's been getting scandalicious lately so I hear. I've been rubbing off and not doing it myself so I am definitely making up for it soon, very soon. I've decided to relate a part of my life to something other than a Dollar Store battery. Now its like a can of Pringles, once you start you cant stop. As in, once i start being retarded, i cant stop.. yeah,  retarded ..or something like that;)
