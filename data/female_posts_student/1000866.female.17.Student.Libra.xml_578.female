Now, I just have to make an outline and find quotes and stuff. Blahhh.  I think I might actually go do some studying for history though. Oh yeah. YaY history.   Other than that I haven't done a lot today. I ran some errands and yeah...that's pretty much it. There's only one thing I want to work on with driving before my actual test. Parking. Ugh. I suck at parking. Honestly. I'm just horrible at it.   Oh well. We shall see. I think I'll go look over my stuff for history now.
