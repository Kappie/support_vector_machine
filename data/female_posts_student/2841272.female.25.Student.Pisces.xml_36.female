I know I'm behind in my reviews but I still have a few days until Fridays main event.  I have to say the closer  Kill Bill Vol. 2  gets, the harder it is to concentrate on these mediocre movies.  I wish for our first disagreement we had a meatier film to wrestle over than  Walking Tall , but I'm sure down the line we'll find something to really go toe to toe over.  Right now I'm too baffled as to how  Tall  earned a B+ in your estimation.  Like you I am familiar with the story but have never seen the original, but unlike you the changes didn't work for me.  The whole time I was watching the film I kept thinking it would have made a lot more sense if they had kept the setting in the South.  Northwesterners aren't really take back our community kind of people.  Perhaps the Rock wasn't up for a Southern accent  As to the gambling I thought it was a brilliant way to modernize the story and offered a platform for the producers to make a wider, social commentary but instead they caricatured the casino and the villain.  When they get what's coming to them in the end you cheer not because they victimized the town, but because they victimized the Rock.  At under ninety minutes the film felt slight with a by the numbers feel.  Rock gets beat up, becomes sheriff, cleans up town.  End of movie.  Where's the struggle, the emotional conflict.  A nice moment between father and son (which was a little too trite for me) does not a good movie make.  The Rock is a charismatic guy but I want to see him really use it, like Bruce Willis in  Die Hard , rather than just skate by.  The Rock was the only halfway notable thing in Walking Tall, which is a shame because if they'd gotten a lead performance on par with the film, they'd have one of the best awful movies of all time, instead it was just awful.
