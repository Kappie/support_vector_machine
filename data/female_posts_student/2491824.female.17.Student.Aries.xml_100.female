We placed and are going to state competition. I wasn't surprised. We rock.   I didn't do anything during the show though... In the program I am listed as being the Sound Operator and Angie is the Assistant Sound Operator, but she does everything during the show... Well, I used to do everything, but when I came back on Thursday after being sick, G wanted to run it with all the added sound effects, and Angie asked if she could run sound since she knew how to do it and let me do sound effects which she didn't know how to do... So I agreed... But after we did one run through with the sound effects, G cut them... leaving me with nothing to do during the show... I always ask Angie if there's anything I could do, but she says that she's got it covered.  ...So the only thing I do for the play now is checking levels before we start. :\  I feel so unneeded... And I was kinda pissed after the show just because it is so pointless for me to be there. ...G asked me what was wrong and I, as usual, denied anything was wrong... I thought I was doing a good job of hiding it... ....Damn him... He's good.   Berkeley Springs did  Actor's Nightmare ... It wasn't as good as our version of it. (Go Claire and Jordy!...and Jessica and Leia and Michael... :)  Oh.. Gabi, the exchange student from Argentina, was there. ...She is so cute... I just want to eat her up. :)  Oh! Oh! ...Tim Lloyd said I was a God ... And (...completely unrelated...) Kyle and Beans were calling me 'Allah' and kneeling and bowing and groveling to me and all that stuff...  ...xint and I mentioned starting a cult so we can be rich... ....I guess I already have three followers... :)
