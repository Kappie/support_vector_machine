It was a good movie, although it got kinda slow and me and sarah kinda started making fun of it after awhile.  hehe.  Britty - i know we were supposed to go see Spidey2 together this week, but i'll gladly go see it again with you, James Franco is soooo hott and Tobey isn't bad either.    Anyways, after the movie, me and Sarah went to Chili's to eat dinner.  I ate a $15 dinner which consisted of a full fajita plate, a drink and a plate of fries....which i ate most of.  I've never been so hungry in my life.  I think its the visitation of the little red friend.  Sarah wanted me to hang out for a little bit, but as i had been out of the house all day, i figured i needed to get home and make sure everything's cool.  It was and i read movie parodies...it was fun.  Then, since i hadn't seen Nathaniel in roughly 4 weeks, i decided to make a sonic run with him.  We hung out and we ended up meeting Ash, Brittnee, Caroline, and Kate dearest at sonic.  We all acted retarded before i had to get nathaniel and myself home before 11.  And now here we are.  All of these events.....took place by driving the manual car. what now gear shifting menace!?!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
