Pooj says: is lu talkin to any of u? Jools says: um ... she's online? Clare says: she no online Pooj says: ok Jools says: you weren't either, until a minute ago Jools says: and yet pooj was able to add you Jools says: god, that's weird Clare says: yes, we all know i blocked u and i forgot to unblock u    Clare has left the conversation.  She's such a bitch! Why did she block me anyway?  I mean, yeah, she blocked me on Friday night (without a reason) but then she unblocked me.  So she would have had to block me again, while I was offline cuz I was off all weekend, for some reason.  Forgot to unblock me, Jesus Christ.  And I can't believe she fancied Dan in January, when he was being really horrible to me.  I dreaded coming to school for months and months, just incase he would start up again.  Just after we all grassed, I was especially edgy.  When was that, March?  Yeah.  Anyway.  Everytime I see them walking up to the turning circle when I get off the bus, I have a spaz, thinking, "Oh my God, what have I done?  How mean will he be this time?" I remember when I saw them, and they followed me to the formroom, kicking me and water onto me all the way.  It was really awful.  That would have been sometime in rainy November.  I wish I'd grassed earlier.  I wish he'd been expelled.  He's been alright since he almost got expelled, yeah, but it's not worth it.  I'm sure he's going to start up again.  And Pooj says that if he does, she's going to slap him.  The worst thing would be having her involved.  I can't cope on my own, but this time I'd go straight to Mr. Hyde, and I don't want Pooj to get hurt.  They only really started on me when she was away, anyhoo.  Like on January 15th, when Dan tried to push me down the stairs.  The stairs in the EDM block, where they all have a metal thingy on them.  By rights he should have been expelled for that.  But he denied it, so what can you do?  He got away with having a BB gun, cannabis and a lighter in school.  I don't know why his word counted for more than ours.  At least he's not coming to Fousseau.  His mummy won't let him go.  I have to go revise for Science now ... we've got the exam tomorrow and I'm sooo gonna fail.  Vale!  *~Jools~*
