This afternoon he held his bottle all by himself for  20  seconds!!! Last night he slept on his left side again and today when ever he played with all his toys in his crib, he looked straight up or to the left. I can't believe how much I love him! Nick is so amazing. I can hardly wait to crawl into bed and snuggle! He still sleeps in his co-sleeper for 1/2 the night and the other half in my and Shawns bed. G'pa Daryl watched Nick his late afternoon while Shawn  I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11.~my 2nd time seeing it. I loved that movie more the second time than the first. I got to enjoy seeing more details with time around that I missed before. There is no way that Bush will be reelected another term. Bush is actually coming to Duluth on Tuesday. I'm sure my aunt, Katie, will be protesting him! This weekend, I think Shawn  I ought to start looking for a larger car seat for Nick. He is 18+ pounds now and only getting bigger...Not fatter G'ma Lu! I'm pretty sure his seat only goes up to 20 pounds. Work again tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it and at the same time, not looking forward to leaving Nick  Shawn. =( I really missed them both last Saturday and called almost every hour! I got 1 of my sister's poems' published! It's titled, Writing Prompt #8. The first few times I read it, it moved me to tears. I attempted to read it to my mom, but couldn't finish because I was crying! My sister, Keely, is an amazing writer.
