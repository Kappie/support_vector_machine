In packing for Houston I've definitely proven this theory true. I get started on four different things, that I'm convinced have to be done at the same time, get confused on what is going where, get frustrated and annoyed because I don't know where to start or what to do next, and attempt to do four other things. It has definitely made packing take longer than it should.   Wayne can back me up on the fact that it takes me a while to move. About three years ago he got really annoyed with my packing technique. I not only frustrated myself, but everyone around me. He was so mad at me that day...    My dad turned 45 today. I feel really lucky that my parents are so young. But parents are another post...   4 days until Houston  song of the day:  Daniel remade by Fuel
