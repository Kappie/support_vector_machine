I was at Master Drive today and we watched this movie where a whole bunch of people died in a car accident. They were all teenagers, and they interviewed the parents, and it was so hard for me to watch. I just wished that I could have told those people about Jesus and how much he loves them.  I guess that's why I decided to start a website with out my parent's permission. I still plan on asking them, since after all I do live under their roof currently and they do buy my groceries and pay for everything, and they're going to pay for college in a few years.  But I kinda saw the internet as a free for all. You know? Some place where I could express my beliefs and someone might actually see them. Some place where my opinions and beliefs weren't being expressed in action, like they are day to day, and it wouldn't be like I was pushing my beliefs onto someone else. Because after all, it is your choice to be reading this.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against being open with my beliefs, my relationship with Jesus. I do it all the time. I just told my friend everything I believe the other night, and she was nice and listened and even asked questions, maybe she was actually interested. It's just that I'm tired of being yelled at for being narrow minded and judgemental. I think I'll still get that on the internet, but at least here, it is your fault to. You are the one reading it.  So be prepared. Because that's what my title is. That's what the address is for goodness sake. All the nails. Everytime I sin, it's another nail in Jesus's body. The title is from a Jars of Clay song called Worlds Apart. It's kinda become my motto since I got back from Costa Rica. I think it always will be.  So be prepared. Because I will be biased, I will be narrow minded. And I will tell you everything I believe; because I want you to hear the truth.  that is of course, if I talk my dad into letting me keep this.
