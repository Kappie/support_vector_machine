He's had one for a really long time and it looks like so much fun, so i decided to follow in the Great Day's footsteps and create my own.  So anyways.......nothing terribly interesting happened today.  Mrs. Cox went through another one of her bipolar spasms...i'm serious that lady needs to get on some serious drugs to fix herself.  The Stars suck at the moment because they are at the bottom of their division and NJ rocks because i think they're leading their division or they're number 2.  I dunno whatever.  Hmmm i have nothing else to put here.....i'll put something else when i remember
