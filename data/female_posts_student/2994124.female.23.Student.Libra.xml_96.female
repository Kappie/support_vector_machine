I'm doing a kids camp down in Bognor Regis (on the south coast down and left a bit from london for you foreigners) for 5-11yr olds. Plus there is a 11-18yr old stream which I'm hoping to stir well clear of cos they scare me!! Its right by the sea so I'm really excited - no skinny dipping for me though!! In fact it is the same ocean that you Arbarbanels were swimming in right?  well have a good week. k xx
