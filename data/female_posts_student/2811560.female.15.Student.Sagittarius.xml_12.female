Plus, they're not very nice to a person like me who's only played the game like 3 times. Except John Kasper. He's my hero.  So I left after like 2.5 hours and told them I didn't feel good. Which wasn't a total lie because it was sorta true I guess. It doesn't exactly help that I haven't slept past 8:00 for the past 3 days. Yeah, so I was the BOA forums last night and this guy Zac told me to IM him. He sounds cool. Plus, I think he goes to Lincoln-Way which may or may not be a good thing. Meh, I don't have much hope in today either. I can't do anything because my Mom is at work and Emily is sick and Jasmine is grounded for not doing laundry. Yay.  Oh yeah, and I just decided not to go to set construction. Whatever. I'm one of those 'I don't care about anything' depressed moods. Someone feel free to cheer me up anytime. Anyone? Anyone?
