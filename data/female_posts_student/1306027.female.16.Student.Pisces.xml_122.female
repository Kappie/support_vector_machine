So basically put,    I need sleep.   Other than that, I'm good. As I stated above, I went grocery shopping with my dad. I had fun. I saw 3 hott guys and so.. you know.. I was happy. My dad let me drive too! One of the guys I saw smiled at me and started to follow me around. Until he saw my dad.. then he kinda went away. *Tear* Lol. O well he was probably too old anyways.  O, and I forgot to tell you the story. What story?   Well, last night while I was working, two 13-year-old boys tried to hit on me.  It was very strange, and funny. I asked them what they wanted and so they told me, and so I started to get it. They changed their minds about a million times so I just kinda stood there, waiting for a solid answer. The one saw me standing there and he's all like "You have pretty eyes!" and the other elbows him and is like "Man stop flirting with her, she's like five years older than you.." Which technically I was only three, but you know it might as well have been five. So the first kid blushes and he's like "O sorry". Haha. Little dork. They were really short too, about five feet tall or so. So I just smiled and finished their order.  When I got done and started to walk away, the one goes "THANK YOU SO MUCH" and I just stopped, turned around, and said in the sweetest possible voice "It's no problem" and then I winked at him... (Lol Lol..) and he all runs off to tell his friend. They were giggling like two little girls I swear. It was really, really, really funny.  Back to the present...  I'm excited about tomorrow. Tabitha (my bestest friend) is coming over tomorrow and we're going to hang out. I think we're going to see white chicks... or anchorman... idk yet. I know we're seeing a movie though. O, and I'm going to take lots o pics while she's here. I want to take her to timmy hoes so she can meet some of the peoples I work with...and so I can see someone (shhhhhhhh).  And thus concludes today's blog entry.
