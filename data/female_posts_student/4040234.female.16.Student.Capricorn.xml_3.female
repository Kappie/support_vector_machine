That's not what it's about. It's about doing something I love, then changing for you, to be hurt, so i can feel loved. There are soo many more people out there that can love me... why stick to just one? This isnt about anyone in particular. I'm just sick of everyone needing someone. Why do u need someone to make you happy, specially someone from the opposite sex? I dont get it. Girls get all depressed... oh he doesnt love me, ohh he's my soul mate if only i could talk to him. Honey please. You dont need him, or his baggage. The only thing your saying is I'm psycho and I need attention. No one wants that. So my thing now is, I'm content. If I happen to see some guy that I'm interested in OK, I'll make an effort if not, you dont get no attention. And if the guy has no interest in me.. then oh well better luck next time. Dont make people pity you because you dont have a bf or gf. Big deal go hug your pillow.   Now, about me. My weekend was crazy. Not necessarily all in a good way. I got totally wasted on Friday. It was fun getting wasted not fun getting over it. My bff, CARMEN, lol came over and we started at my house... then headed up to matts. boy that was fun. I cant remember too much.. except for hitting my head ( cuz it hurts ) and kissing lots of ppl. It was a good time. Now Saturday unfortunately was not as good. I had to work. that was bad. Ya i only worked 2 hrs... and puked every 20 mins. fun... so i left. I had a slight hangover Sunday. But I'm straight now. Cant wait to do it again....  I've also finally given up on someone. He wasnt anyone special. and I'm not gonna name him. But shit happens. You give yourself up, and in return you get shoved out the door. Literally. I tried to reconcile w/ him... He just wouldnt have it. I understand i kinda spazzed out, but sorry oops i was drunk again... things come out. But I've given up... I dont care. I'm better off w/out u... as a friend. And thats all I ever wanted from him... Just to be cool, as friends. Not to hook up and be used. Thats what he wanted.   I'm tired of apalogizing for his mistakes....   FUCK HIM. i dont care about him... have a nice life... and if your still gonna talk shit about me... at least grow some balls and say it to me. People are just stupid. You should kno if your gonna talk shit about me to my best friend, I'm gonna find out... Your not worth the secret...   Now that that's said and done. I think I'm ok... I'm gonna go... I'm starving...
