I got a 60% on the Chem test and honestly in my heart I really though I did good, I studied more for that test that I usually study for tests just because I wanted to do good.  I spent half of the night crying over it and the fact that I don't understand Chem and my teacher is sorta trying to help but like she doesn't make any sense and I don't know who else to ask.  I mean I wasn't always amazing at balancing equations but now all the concepts are building on a skill I am weak at and I am confused about dissociation and non-ionic, total ionic, and net ionic equations.  Right when I got my mark back there again going through my head was "why am I on this earth, and what is my purpse??"  I know I want to teach science so bad by why does reaching my goal seem so difficult right now, I am having those bad thoughts again roll through my heads - the ones about suicide and death, the thoughts I wish I didn't have but are so real and deepest thoughts that I can't share with anyone.  And well I tried to get help with my math and all but well today I did the quiz and well I didn't understand the last question at all.  Go figure a word problem thing but well I couldn't get part A right and I couldn't even finish part B or C because part A's answer was crucial - so basically there goes 5 marks down that drain - five important marks.  I think my math teacher really understands what hard time I am having trying to make sense of everything and I am getting really frustrated trying to figure out things - everything is just becoming so difficult.  I don't want to admit it to myself but in honestly reality I don't know how I will even make honors, I mean it mean's soooooo much to me yet I am trying my BEST right now, my very best and I don't know what else to do.  And I was thinking too - do I have a talent, what is my talent.  When I thought about this there was not a single thing that I can think of that makes me talented at something, the only thing that ever made me proud was marks because it was something that was earned through hard work.  But what about now...where is all my hard work getting me to, I mean I guess no one's road to achieve all their goals and dreams is perfect but I never thought it was this bad ever for anyone.  I just pray that tommorow goes better, and that maybe I will understand Chem a little more, and maybe my math teacher will help me with my math and understand that I really am very confused.  Maybe someone special will see me and say "hi" or maybe they will just smile.  Maybe things won't be perfect, but I can try to make things better.  I never really know what the future holds so all I can hope and wish for is that tommorow will be better than today.
