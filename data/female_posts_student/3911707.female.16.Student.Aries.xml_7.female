We talked to Jake for awhile and shot the shit, then Shana and I decided to drive to BD, where we harassed random people by yelling shit out the windows of my van. At one point these guys tried picking us up, so I decided to pull over. We were right by them when my phone rang. It was Pat. My guilty conscience answered the phone and ignored the guys. We walked right back and they tried to get us to come over by them and I told them to hold on. They're  probably still "holding on" seeing as though I jumped back in my van and left. Picking up guys while on the phone with Pat wasn't a choice. I was surprised that he called in the first place. We chit-chatted for awhile and he made plans for us for tonight after he gets done with work. Wow, either he's changed or he's looking for a piece. Even though I know I wont be able to go, I asked him if he wanted to go to Chi-town with me on Saturday for Hot Import Nights. He said that we'd talk about it tonight. I'm suppose to go swimming with Gwen and Crystal today. Swimming, again. Blah. I have to say this though, I love Alicia. I talked to her last night and she can always make me smile. Damn that girl for being funny.
