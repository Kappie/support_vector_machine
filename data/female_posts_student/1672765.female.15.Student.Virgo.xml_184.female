I have to remember next time I have an appointment to make pudding before I go so I can eat that afterwards. I'm not sure but I don't think pudding is vegetarian. I could be wrong but I think that's right. But in anyway, I don't care. I love eating pudding when my teeth hurt. Ha. My mom tells me to just eat soup or ramen but why do that when you can eat pudding.  When I first got my braces my teeth hurt for days and I lived off pudding and ramen. I would make the Top Ramen then cut up the noodles in the broth and then just drink it with the 2" noddles whole - not even bothering to try and chew. Those were good days. I stayed on that diet longer than I had to because I liked the excuse to eat it.   I've been watching an average of at least three movies a day since school got out.
