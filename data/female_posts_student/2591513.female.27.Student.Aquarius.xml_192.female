Mostly because I know that there are people I love dearly who are completely opposite of me.  Anyway, there was a alady on one of my so called groups that was completely bashing everything going on in Iraq.  Yes, I hate the fact that all this is going on.  I hate that Ed has to go out there...but....never mind.    I don't want to go any further without offending anyone.  Yes I am a Republican, but I liek to think that I am an educated one and that I do not just vote strictly Republican.  I vote for the best candidate even if he/she is a democrat.  Anyway, enough politics.  Despite what people think, we can all throw this on Bush's feet and hang him.  In America we have a democracy and a President, however powerful they maybe, does not have the power to make decisions on his own...at least that is what I learned...but hey I am not saying I am completely knowledgeable on this either.  So if you "school" me, the point well be well taken.  I bet I have less friends now that I have divulged that I am a Republican...lol
