Anyway, I hope she gets a place of her own soon, so she can live her life and deal with her own responsibilities and not have to worry about the pressures of being around kids.  I love having her around, but it is time for her to live her own life too.  So I hope she gets into the 4 year college of her dreams and is able to get a place of her own...WHEN SHE IS READY...no pushing here...  I am not feeling well at all.  I have SO MUCH HOMEWORK to do too.  I am so stressed out.  I need to gte better so I can kind of concentrate on homework.  I have to take Stitch to get his stitches out.  Him and his girlfriend are trouble.  They are getting into everything and Kawaii is the ring leader teaching him how to tear up them boxes in the garage.  I hope they don't get to the kids' books...if they do, well I don't know what else to do with them.  Having a dog is tough, I mostly wanted it for the kids and Ed.  It will be fun when Ed is gone and I have to clean up after Stitch...YUCK  Well have a good one guys...
