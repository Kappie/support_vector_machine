I want to be with you in your dreams too And tell you that I love you because You're sweet and beautiful You have a good personality And what I really like is when You make me laugh better yet when You make me sing and if you cry I'll be there catching your tears telling you not to fear For I am here by your side Dreaming in this sleep of ours in all hours of the day and night I promise you everything will be alright I'll never forget you Even if we do sometimes fight Take a step back into the light Into the light of your heart Shining down on me warmer than any sun I've ever known and learnt to become In this dream we are closer It's just us and with that light shining You make all this true Me and you together For the moment we can dream until our dreams actually come true Because dreams do come true Once I finally have you in my arms To caress and hear you laughing at jokes How cute that would be.... I'm dreaming of you a bright star Oh my little pretty I wonder if you ever think about me?
