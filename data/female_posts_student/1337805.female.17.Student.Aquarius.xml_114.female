Her daughter, who is also in grade 11, is interesting in joining youth group again. By chance, I looked them up in the photo directory. They were in it. The daughter seems to be on of those "preppy, popular, twink" types. But oh well. She must be cool if she wants to join our youth group, and it's another girl who just happens to be my age. Chances are though, she'll go to the dark side, the "cool" side and leave poor me and Fiona alone in the dust.  Mom is still refusing to pay for Oregon. Tonight, I'm gonig to ask her to make a list of stuff she would like me to do that would convince her to give me the money to go. I'm getting anxious, because the cost is about to go up soon, and I know for sure she wouldn't pay when the rate is 100$ US. Grrrrrowls. Excited for this weekend. Friday I make up a socials class I skipped, then go home and do homework and some of the list and pack for that night. Youth overnighttttt!!!Hurrah. Then I come home Saturday morning to do more of the list, clean my room, and anything else, and then I go over to Laura's for.....DISNEY DAYS! We are going to spend the rest of Saturday and as much of Sunday as we possibly can to watch 24+ Disney movies. I'm so excited, I'm bringing tissues, and everything. We're gonna gorge on junk food too, stay up all night...Totally girls night. I've already packed the movies.  Monday is a pro-d day, and Tyler has that day off work, so we're thinking of getting the truck and his canoe and going up to Thetis all day to canoe and swim, if we can. It'll be great fun, cause Tyler is such a goof. I really can't wait. Tonight I'm going to Ash's to finally learn DnD...That is, if Ashley and Misha don't go. Seeing as I'm not too close with them (I strongly dislike them) I wouldn't feel comfortable going. Will is supposed to be there. He claims the next time he sees me he was going to give me the hugs he owes me. Maybe I'll actaully get them this time. Adam is supposed to be there too. And well. We all know about Adam. If he is there, and I can trap him alone, then I will ask him about...yes. The thing. I won't post it on here, it's rather personal. I think.  Fiona, if by chance you read my blog, check your email. Fall con forms, youth group forms, YAC emails....There's a lot. I can't even begin to comprehend what I have to tell you. Please go tomorw night, Laura isn't going and I don't want to be all alone with Tom..*whimper*  I'll post the offical Disney things Saturday, if I get a chance, to keep you all informed.  See you all Tuesday.
