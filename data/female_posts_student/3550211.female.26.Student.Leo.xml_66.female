We have to look these monsters squarely in the face and see them for what they are if we are to sustain the morale necessary to keep taking the fight to them. But this does not in any way lessen the need for us to make sure that the U.S. government hasn't endorsed or practised much milder but still reprehensible abuse and torture." - andrew sullivan  I completely agree
