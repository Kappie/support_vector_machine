So today I go out and there is this girl from another office sitting there looking worried and I am keeping to myself when she asks me if I am familiar with Pugs.  Uh yes.  She proceeds to tell me that she recently purchased a very young pug from a breeder who assured her it was a pure-bred.  She paid a price she had found to be common among pure-bred pugs and thought nothing of it.  Then her friend sees her pug and says to her it doesn't at all look like a pure-bred, it looks like it might have been crossed with another form of small dog.  So now the girl wants to know and can't find the breeder's phone number and is worried she might have paid too much and she just wants to know what kind of dog she has.  She assures me she loves the dog and doesn't want to give it up but she just doesn't know what to do.  Um, what am I supposed to say here.  So I assure her that it is probably a pure-bred and that sometimes they look a little different then they do on television.  So she's gotten whatever she needed to out of her system and goes inside.  It was random.  Oh, and just to add, the women from this other office who always come out and ignore me completely are standing there when a cicada comes over and lands right on one of them who just flips out and starts screaming.... I feel vindicated.
