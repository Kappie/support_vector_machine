       
      1  1/2 hours until the beginning of the end.  I feel pretty comfortable with the material for this exam, but I have no idea how I am actually going to do.  I mainly just can't wait for it to be over.  It seems like this exam period has been really long.  But soon (tomorrow) I will be wisking my way home on the wings of angels (and Northwest Airlines) to holiday merriment and relaxing fun.  You will not recognize the person I will be over the next couple of weeks.  Cherish the time you have to be yourself while you can, I say.  It may not soon return.
