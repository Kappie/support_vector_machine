I was late for my medical appt.. all becos there was an accident on the tram line..for all places.. so I validated my tram tix for nothing..   Phew! Lucky I manage to see the doc..he was kind enuff to see me.. most of the time they don't give a damn..but well God is good, wat can I say.. did a urine sample again and the nurse siphon some blood off me..wed..I'll check with them for the results..if it's unfavourable, I'll hav to go for more tests to check on muah body...  Wednesday is the dateline for my first chapter so I muz jia you to finish up the chapter...my intro is giving shape so tt's great.. I juz need to tie the loose end.. as for my first chapter..it's kinda crappy but who cares... hee hee..I muz persevere till Thurs morn.. coz Terence will be back..and I don't intend to do much wrk tt day.. gonna spend time with him and catchup on the lost time...yes, I'm countin down...  Kinda shock at the drinkin habits of some ppl... Jac told me abt her colleagues I think it's hilarious... supa wasted..tt's all I can say... Terence calls it "binge drinking" and he's totally agst tt.. I feel it doesn't prove anything, worst still, it juz proves how empty your life can be... I understand if someone gets drunk "accidentally" but to do so with a vengance is kinda dumb... the consequences can be grave..wat if you get rob, rape and killed.. I really can't see the pt of putting oneself in danger..ok if there's someone there to be your chaperone, tt's totally cool..but if there's no chaperone, one muz drink with caution...   PS: kinda enjoying to Franz Ferdinand now on radio..NOVA rocks!!
