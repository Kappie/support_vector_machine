The cast, director, crew, producers, everyone just looked they had a blast working on The Lord of the Rings movies. I hope I have a job like that whenI grow up.A job I just can't wait to get to every morning. You know that old quote "Find a job you like, and you'll never work a day in your life"? I want that. I don't want to trudge off to the office every morning and gather around the water cooler to talk about what we saw on TV the night before, like 80% of thepoorshmuckswalking around America. I want excitment, adventure,  meaning . Unfortuanly my mom just called and she wants me to set the table.   Oh, the exciting life I lead.
