The computer's the only good thing about returning here.  Cali's good so far. Here's another one of my signature bulleted lists:  Positives: - seeing Nat and Pam for the first time in several years (9 and 7, respectively) - shopping in Chinatown, especially my new Chinese dress to go with the Vietnamese dress Jane gave me - friendly people - seeing the sights (DUH!) - INCREDIBLY LARGE ASIAN POPULATION! I AM IN ASIAN HEAVEN! - going to an Asian goods store and seeing not only Ayumi posters on the wall, but also Ayu/BoA/Hikaru Utada CD's on the shelves... (Yet again, in heaven!)  - inside jokes w/ Nat (The Skittle family, lady on the highway with styrofoam on the front of her car) - cable car rides  Negatives: - only going to the cheap, touristy part of Chinatown, and completely skipping the teenage goods that REAL Chinese girls wear/use/buy in China - parents having no idea where to go - realizing that USF is a  Jesuit  college (I felt so stupid...) - only being with the Kwongs for less than two days - really cold weather (GAH! It's horribly windy and cold - the high today was about 51) - me gaining weight (haha... people will hate me for this remark, but it's true!) - me being away from all the Indy peeps (I'm sorry you're bored, Ash!! I'd be there, but...) - spending an hour and a half in Walgreens because Mom was choosing what to buy for relatives who don't even talk to her - losing a couple days in LA because we can't keep to the schedule  Although the negative list is long, I still am having a good time. Tomorrow, we head off to LA, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to blog before I get home. We have a 2:30 A.M. (Indy time) flight from LA on Sunday morning, so y'all can call me later that afternoon.  "I never tire of being useful."
