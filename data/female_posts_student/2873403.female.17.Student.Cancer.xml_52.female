"And I don't know on which side his heart falls  But I know where mine is buried  And it's so far from any wanting  Yeah, it needs this to keep beating  It won't go on without it."  "But now there is no way to change this  So I just photographed and framed it  And itâ€™s hanging in a hallway  That we have no right to walk back down"    I wish I never felt this way.
