Probably another growth spurt. Abby can tell you the vocals have been cracking like a mofo. I just ate about a thousand pounds of cow, but I know that I'm going to wake up tomorrow and be 149.5.   Don't get ulcers or ulcer-like things, kids, they're bad and they make you want to take opiates so that you can eat without getting killed.  I set things on fire tonight! Boards and stuff! We did hardcore racing trixxx with Seth's 30+ MPH RC car. Remember those remote control cars that used to be so cool? Well they've been advancing the technology on these suckers...they can top at about 70 MPH now. The only reason they can't go higher is because the frames aren't strong enough...the torque twists them to pieces over a certain point. But it's seriously the coolest thing in the world watching a little RC going as fast as a street car.  They have races for this kind of thing, so Seth and one of his friends started the "L337 Racing Team", and I got drafted today, so I guess I'm in. And since my mom is going to be married to Glen sometime soon I'm going to milk him for all he's worth and get a real frickin' expensive top-of-the-line RC and just take it out on weekends and make some money with it.  Glen...  Rraugh.  Well, I won't be an EMO kid and trouble you all any longer. I was at Seth's and Abby called and I missed it, and now it's past 9:30 so I can't call back without getting busted...and I've caused enough trouble today....so I'm going to go cry in my room now and pretend that I don't hate myself.  cheers, mates
