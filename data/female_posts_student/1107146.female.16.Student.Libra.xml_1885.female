Perhaps they do and just say they don't; they probably do put MSG in, actually. In any event, it's all still really sodium-filled and 100% Dee-lish!  Altho I just had pizza and I'm really full. Thinking about food at this point would make me sick.  Thought processes on display...interesting?!? You can find out a lot about someone by how they think. Altho all Rosie's told me is that she need a life, and she needs one FAST. And I think she called someone a "fox"; quite antediluvian, only contributing to the "you need a life" deal. And she's overanalytical. I mean, it's black, who da hell keers whether it's more purple or not. But if that is true, I think I'll be setting my wardrobe on fire. Or just enjoy it, seeing as how ghey I am.  I find it more fun to think about endlessness or nothingness. Since it's not remotely humanly perceivable, it gives me a really whacked out, "whoa...life is awesome/ghey" feeling.  Sweet. I'm going to go think about nothing now...literally. It's going to be whacked out. I said I was going to experiment with fingerpaints and I wasn't kidding, and now I'm going to have fun thinking about human-planarly impossible stuff.
