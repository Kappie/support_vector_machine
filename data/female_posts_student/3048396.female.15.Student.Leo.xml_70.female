Then I try to talk bout it to someone and they just practically bite my head off...*sigh* I wish I was leaving tomorrow...Maybe everything would be better. But I have a few days to wait. Tomorrows gonna suck. I wont do anything all day and I'll probably end up like I did today...crappy. Saturday Im gonna babysit my sweetie Cassie. Then Sunday...which will be hell...is gonna be full and I leave at 2. Im gonna let all my tears out Sunday...tho I wont want to...I'll be infront of 100 people but oh well...I betcha most of them will be crying too. I wont be the only one. But *sigh* its really gonna be hard...Howard was the best. He helped me thru alot of things. Im really gonna miss him. But I guess Im also looking forward to Jeff coming. He'll be good. So yeah. Anyways I just have to keep busy and I'll make it thru the next few days. I think Howard leaving might be why Im so down n stuff. Dunno. Anyways all I know is that im really excited bout next week...just hope I don't get to emotional. Or lose it. I think another thing thats gettin to me is...oh nevermind. If I bring it up might cause problems so forget all that.        Onto other matters...I just got the Sunday School Music for next year. I have to sort thru some of it and see what songs we can do. Im excited about that. *Puts new cd in now* This will be fun. Im exctied. I get to do it all by myself and I love little kids so it'll be fun. If we get it all worked out I might have Tara hold the music...I could play piano and Jeff might play his guitar or something. It'll be interesting. But this is all about new beginnings so if some people don't like the music and want the old stuff...to bad. Im in charge now. :-D And I love little kids!        Anyways I did practically nothing all day. I packed some and watched a movie. Im just to damn lazy. Yeah. Well I have no more to say...so later all.
