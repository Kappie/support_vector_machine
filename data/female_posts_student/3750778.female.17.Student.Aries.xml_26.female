I was only at my house for about 2 hours because I went to a carwash for out youth trip at 8 and came home at 12. and then I went to micahs house and went swimming with my youth group.   I ended up coming home from Micah's with much more than a sunburn.... OO but he is soo cute... his name is Christian(I'll tell you the story later..or its probably on  urlLink Micah's joural )...o yea and he's my new kitty... he's soo cute! Right now he is sleeping behind my monitor, hiding from Nakomie(my princess kitty). It's ok I would hide too...
