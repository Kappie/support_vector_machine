Baka awoke as Hito began her meditation, She looked at the flamed eyes that were compleatly detached from everything around. Then teh tip of one of Baka's tails sparked and set on fire.      "AAAAAAH! Ow ow ow!" Baka yelled putting the fire out quickly.      "How'd ya think that could've happened?" Kuwabara asked watching Baka nurse her crispy tail      "I wish I could say, the fire died a long time ago" Kurama said as confused as everyone.      An evil smile crossed Hito's lips as the dead fire began to crackle again. They all looked at her irritated as Kurama hit her in the head knocking her out of meditation but still smiling and laughing as she said innocently,      "What? I didn't do anything!" She sat up as Yuske walked up and muttered      "So, You mean to say we spent an hour getting a fire started when you're a walking LIGHTER?!?!"     She thought for a moment blinking rapidly as she then cheerfully spouted, "Yep-a yep-a!"     Yuske then hit her in the head as well, followed by a kick from Baka. Hiei simply raised an eyebrow as the beating commenced, Kuwabara asked confused,      "So you can like, Create fire and stuff?"      Hito looked at him irritated rubbing her head, "No Numb-Nuts, I create sparkly little fariys that explode in beautiful patterns bringing joy to all of the children of the world!"      "when did you learn how to do that?" Baka asked her tilting her head      Hito tripped her with a swift sweep of her leg as she stood poking the fire with a stick the end of the stick lighting as she then stared at the flame it thenk forming the shape of a small cat.     "Owie!" baka Cried then seeing the shaped flame marvled, "Ooooh! Kitty!"      The flame froze and shaped into a ruby as Hito tossed it into the air kicking it quickly as baka yelled     "NOOOOOOO! Poor kitty..." as the sparkling shards fell to the ground
