She said, "I hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm  completely nude." With that, stripped from the neck down, rolled the dice  and yelled, "Come on, baby, Mama needs new clothes!"  As the dice came to a stop she jumped up and down and squealed..."YES! YES!  I WON, I WON!"  She hugged each of the dealers and then picked up her winnings and her  clothes and quickly departed.  The dealers stared at each other dumfounded. Finally, one of them asked,  "What did she roll?" The other answered, "I don't know - I thought you were  watching."  MORAL: Not all blondes are dumb, but all men are men.
