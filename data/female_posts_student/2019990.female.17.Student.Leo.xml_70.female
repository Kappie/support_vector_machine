My mother is freaking out a littel bit since Wonder Woman is leaving in about a month, so she has been super nice to both of us lately. And she decided to take us school shopping tomorrow. And we get to school shop in the cities too.  SoI went to grocery store this morning. My mom needed bleach so she sent me off.I was going to buy some frozen meals, but I was like well, I have one at home that I got last time. So I get home, and Wonder woman had eaten both my dry pasta bowl and my frozen meal! She always eats my food. But if you drink one of her Frappacinos it's death to you.  I've noticed that my blog has been losing it's ability to communicate lately. When I came home from Pittsburgh the chatterbox started to flounder, now recently my comments have been struggling. Next thing you know my quote of the day will lose the will to quote. I just don't know what to do. my poor blog. Soin conclusionCon: Wonder Woman is leaving Pro: I may end up with a nice wardrobe, food, and closet space.
