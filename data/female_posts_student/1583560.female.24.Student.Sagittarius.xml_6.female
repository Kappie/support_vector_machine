Freshman year I lived at the Clark Kerr dorm 30 miles from campus (ok, so it was only a 15 minute walk, but hey, I drove to class in high school).  My roommates were Jennifer and the Invisible Woman (ie, she was never there.  So Jennifer and I had a really big double)  Down the hall were Justin and his roommates, and downstairs were Kami (and her roomates) and Noah (and his).  We mingled, watched movies, avoided homework, dyed our hair, and redefined the term "hall sports" together.  Towards the end of that year, we attended a presentation on finding off-campus housing, as everyone was getting kicked out of the dorms (Berkeley has this policy of admitting more students than it can provide dorm space for).  Here we were, innocent, naive, sheltered....and being kicked out into the cold, cruel world of no rent control.  What else could we do but band together, put together a housing resume (I think I may still have a copy), and trek out the to far reaches of space (northside) to search for a slightly larger cardboard box.  In the end, after paying a hefty sum of money and seeing more than our fair share of 2 bedroom apartments trying to pass off as 4 bedroom, Jennifer, Justin, Noah, and I found a house on Francisco Street.  A house being taken over by ivy (and rats a few years later), but a house nonetheless.  A drafty, dark, scary house, but...anyways.  This being only 20 minutes away from campus by walking was considered quite a find (if not an excellent exercise program when you forgot your homework at home)  Kami had taken the other path and become an RA, with housing provided and more freshman than you could shake a stick at.  She had also become involved in an organization known as the Third World Liberation Front (those of you at Intel will be relieved to hear it was abbreviated to a FLA - TWLF) (Those of you not Intel-ified, FLA is my remake of TLA, which, (are you ready?) stands for "Three Letter Acronym").  Memory fails me here, but I believe there were some overnighters spent on campus in protest.  Somehow, someone (coughcoughNoah) renamed this effort TWFL (pronounced "Twiffle").  This was so irritating that it somehow became the name of our house.  And so a house named with capital letters and still outside the Greek system (logistically and geographically) was born.  And that my friends, is what TWFL means.  To 5 kids from Berkeley :)
