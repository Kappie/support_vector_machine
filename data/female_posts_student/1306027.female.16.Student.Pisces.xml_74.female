I mean, keeping secrets is hard to do when you want to vent on stress, but- just so you get an idea the stress is like:  Driving off a cliff knowing that the edge is coming up and you can't turn the wheel.  Was that a good enough description? Not that I mind all the work this prom has taken to get off the ground, it's just I'm 16, and, life only gets more stressful from here. A break? Ha! This is real life we are talking about....   Of Course, you out there telling yourself that I should lighten up  I'd love to do that! Why don't you give me a way to lighten up and I'd be happy too. Right now just, let me vent and shutup. You don't have to listen. In fact- why are you still here reading this?    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  Ok, I'm better. Paper bags tend to help a lot. Remember that. Anyways on with my ranting....    Nails.  Why do we have them anyways? They suck! Well, not literaly. Let me offer up some suggestions as to what they are commonly used for these days.  1.  An Alternative Food Source.   2.  10 Deadly Weapons   3.  A Useful Pick   4.  A Handy Wedge  And that's only a few. Whenever you are born nobody sticks a tape recording to your ear that repeats "Do Not Chew Your Freaking Nails, Moron" endlessly. Why? Well, for one it might be degrading. And two- that would be a mirror of the book  Brave New World , which I will not summarize simply because it can't be.    So what's the big deal?  Why do people have to have their nails 6 inches long and looking like a chrome plate? I mean, they are not only a national threat but they distract you with their shiny-ness as well. I, on the other hand, have .02 inch long nails and they would'nt crack a peel on a banana. (Crack- a peel? Yea weird analogy...just live with it.)    Besides my nails...  I..I... have nothing else to complain about really. I mean I could get into gruesome detail on everything but, I think I will spare the 2 solid readers that I have. Love you guys!    Without further ado I give you........ nothing at all.
