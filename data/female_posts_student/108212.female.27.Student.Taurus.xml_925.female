Emphasis on my lack of qualifications.   2 -  35 Years of Carlos ,  a look at Carlos Santana's career.  How much is substance, how much is shrewd playing of the market, and if we like the way he plays, why do we care?   3 -  I Assassin Down the Avenue ,  a review of "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart", last year's movie about Chicago's favorite indie band, Wilco.
