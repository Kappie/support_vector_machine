It looks so good!!! I love it!!!  It was one heck of a strange feeling seeing my hair lying on a tabletop in front of me. Odd stuff, I tell you, but I didn't cry at all. O'Neil, the feller who cut it for me, was so awesome. He was so very excited, too, because he thought it was great that he could turn my long-haired head into a short-haired one (he likes short hair a lot). Oooh! All the assistants and other hairstylists at the studio kept walking by to see the progress, and I had an audience by the time O'Neil was done. Hehe... everyone liked it, and I love it!! I feel so much lighter, honestly.   I think it actually looks better than the long hair, maybe, but I am so happy to have helped someone. It feels really good to fill out a Locks of Love form... and I even get a certificate in the mail for it!!! How cool is that?!  I can do flippy stuff with the hair if I choose, but it's so much work that I doubt I'll choose to a whole lot. The cut should be easy to style within 5-10 minutes, which is a yay, because as you know I'm always running. W00t!!!   Well, as all of you probably know by now, I hate taking pictures, but I compromised and took a quick picture with the crappy camera so you could see *the haircut*...    urlLink    This is it!!!
