Michael Barrett is 10 for his last 18 in his last 5 games. That's a large jump from his one hit he had whine with the Angels. Mark Kotsay however has had troble with the trade he is just 3 for his last 20 and the Mets have lost 7 of thier last 10 games falling to second in the NL East.   In Los Angeles Brian Boehringer hasn't done anything to show he deserves to be in the majors. He has allowed 5 ER in only 8.1 innings of relief for the Dodgers. Kirk Gibson has been hot of late. He's 7 for his last 16 with 2 homeruns and 4 RBIs. The Dodgers are 7-3 since the trade.  The Angels have plugged Chone Figgins in as the teams centerfielder versus lefties, Figgins is 8 for 21 since the trade and has been a spark at the bottom of the order for the team. The other player the Angels picked up, Scioscia is 9 for 25 with 2 homeruns and has 8 RBIs as the teams catcher. Scioscia has picked up the slack in the bottom of the order and in turn the Angels have won 7 of their last 10.
