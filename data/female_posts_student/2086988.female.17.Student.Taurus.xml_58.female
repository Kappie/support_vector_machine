First off, this morning I ran into my dad's truck and knocked my bumper in a bit, it didn't dent it, and it's hardly noticable, lol but I still can't believe I did that. Then in history this morning, me and Em were texting each other since we're not in english together anymore :( and Coach Welock saw it and changed the freaking language to Japanese, at least there was a girl in there that knew it, so I got it fixed, lol but still that was gay. Then I had dance, dude my teacher counted me absent! Lol I think it was because I introduced myself as Ashley Wilson instead of Carroll, but still I'm the only Wilson in the class, it's not that hard to put 2 and 2 together, but whatever, teachers at North are dumbasses. Then I was driving up my drive way today and I took the corner too fast and did a complete circle in the driveway! lol whoops my bad, today has just not been my day. Then just now I was talking to Lauren and I thought it was Lauren Brandon, lol but it was Lauren Wilson, I seriously need to go back to bed or something, I don't know what is wrong with me! I think I need David back, lol that might help ALOT...Brr it's cold here! Stupid Texas weather!    I hear your name whispered on the wind  It's a sound that makes me cry  I hear a song blow again and again through my mind
