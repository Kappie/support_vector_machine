Don't get wrapped up in meaning. It'll never be clear if all you do is search. Live in the moment, for the moment. Understanding won't come to those who sit around waiting for it to arrive.  It's okay. You don't have to care that much.   I know it sounds like a senseless philosophy, but it sure can be a damn good one to live by. At least if you like to live with a little less weight on your shoulders. A little less burden of drama, I suppose.  So this college search thing is going well. I'm pretty sure I've got my heart set on one school. Easily attainable, fairly affordable (given I get some pretty good scholarships/financial aid), and all around just the type of school I'm really looking for. Hendrix College in Arkansas. It's a small, private, liberal arts school with a population smaller than KHS (about 1100). For one, they offer both of my majors of interest (International Relations and Political Science), not to mention that their entire curriculum really focuses on my interests and the types of ideals that I hope to carry into a career someday. Something about that school just makes me...excited to head off next year.  Blah.  I've nothing more to say crazies.
