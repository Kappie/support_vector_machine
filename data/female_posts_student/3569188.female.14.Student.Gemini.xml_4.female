I mean, she went to the beach with Stori, and then she's going off to celebrate Stori's B-Day later. Grr to her. Anyhoo..  Corey remembered. He would though..he knows what it's like to not have anyone remember. So far today, I have pretty much wasted the day. I watched Charlie's Angels; Full Throttle (which is so completely gay), then I cleaned, and then that's pretty much it besides the internet. Total waste. I think I might clean out my closet later...fascinating experiences for a fascinating Birthday. Whatever. Well, write later maybe.
