Too bad. ;) Anywho, I don't mean for this blog to have a definite theme or plan because I honestly don't do that well with themes and plans. I'm not a good 'themer', or 'planner', or whatever.   I'm interested in various things. Religion is one- I mainly am interested in  urlLink Catholicism  and  urlLink Bahá'í . If you're of one of these faiths, or maybe of an entirely different faith, please let me know. I'd be quite interested to hear of your experiences and compare them with mine.   Philosophy is cool too. I like  urlLink Pragmatism  and  urlLink Existentialism , though I'm not a strict ideologue for either of these viewpoints. Again, if you are an adherent to either of these philosophies or something totally different, I'd be interested to know.   Politically, I like  urlLink Libertarianism , though I disagree with them on a few issues.   I use  urlLink Linux  as my OS (though fortune sometimes compells me to use windoze bokses), and I like to program in  urlLink Python  and sometimes  urlLink Perl .   I speak a little French, and I'm interested in conlangs such as  urlLink Esperanto  and  urlLink Lojban .   Anyway, that's all I can think of for thise moment. More later.   -Ian
