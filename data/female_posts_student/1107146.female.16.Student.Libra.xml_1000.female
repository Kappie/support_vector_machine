You'd have to check inside your template settings and look for the text that's being used somewhere in the HTML, look for a number next to the text....  You know, I'm probably just talking out my ass. Most of the HTML I do know is because of BLog, and that has taught me very little but enough to get me by. As for this...  Whoa.
