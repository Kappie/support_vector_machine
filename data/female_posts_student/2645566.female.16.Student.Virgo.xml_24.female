It could be simple and you both said the same thing, or it can be deep and personal. I don't know how many times that's happened with me...The unimportant ones at least. It always happens; most people call it coincidence. But what about the other kind. Those times when you "happen" to be on the same page with someone. Especially if they are close to you. I can say that I can count those times on one hand. That those times mean the most to me. That one of those times happened in a conversation last night. How can someone know what is deep in my heart and bring up the same question? How can someone understand me so well and yet not at all? It's all so puzzling. What I need is time to think...but it's hard to think when you have underlying questions. I need that one underlying question answered, but only one person can do so. Will the result be jeopardy? Am I willing to give up myself if I don't ask the question? Is it time to take the next step in my life? Should I even be questioning such a thing? All these questions and so little answers. I need to find the one piece of the puzzle...that's all I ask. Answer one question, find the one piece, and the rest falls into place.
