Well, now I guess this entry is just going to turn into a collection of complaints.    1.  AJ would you please, please find your strength to tear yourself away from Ben for just one class period and help me with the layout!  All you have to do is press the shift key, click on the text and press delete.  So simple a monkey could work it.  I know it will be difficult to break away from Ben but for the love of God just do IT!   2.  Now, Kurt, you think you can walk up to me and look all cute like and give me that look, with those adorable eyes and ask for gum and expect me to give it to you whenever you ask...well I guess you're absolutely right.  3. A school zone is 15 mi/hr...NOT 5 mi/hr!  When I was coming home today I was driving behind this truck that decided to go that slow.  But their were no children around and I understand his need to be caution but come on.  But that's not all, oh no, when he wanted to turn onto a residential street you need to yield to oncoming traffic but not if theirs nothing coming.  You don't need to stop, sit there for awhile and then go!  GRRRR! 4. HOMEWORK! Enough said!  ~god bless
