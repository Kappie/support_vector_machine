I think thats like a C-, too. Which sucks because I really tried. Oh well. Its cinco de mayo today, so we ate a bunch of food in spanish which was cool. We were supposed to walk around the room in a circle yelling this chant, which was not cool. Oh well, I just sort a pretended to do it and it worked. It was Johnny K's 16th birthday today. Fun stuff. I think we're going to Pyde's house on Saturday for a little shindig. Fun. I'm thinking about inviting tyhe freshmen from marching band to come, but I'm afraid we might scare them off...the boys get a little crazy when they come into contact with caffeine and x-box at the same time. Yeah, maybe thats not such a great idea, lol. You gotta love em though, they're a lot of fun. Oh well. I have a voice lesson...I gotta go now. Wow, I'm talking to my blog...
