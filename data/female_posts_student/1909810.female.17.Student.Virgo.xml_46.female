She's had cancer for quite some time...I can't even remember seeing her when she hasn't had it.  My family members had always said things like "she's not feeling to well..." or "she most likely won't be making it to the wedding..." or any other major event. But she did.  She always got better.  I don't think it's like that this time.  And even though there really isn't a way to prevent breast cancer(that's how it started) I must blame the doctors for her condition.  My mother said she had tried to tell her doctors she felt something odd, asked them to look at her and they said they detected nothing.  Nothing .  How could they detect nothing when she could figure it out by herself!? I think she got a couple other opinions too...they gave her the same shoulder shrug and sent her on her way to die.  Then when it became even more noticable to her she went into see a doctor again(a different one) and of course, they found cancer, in a very developed stage.  Cancer is treatable.  If they had gotten to her sooner would she be healthier?   I need to be writing her an email right now.  But the words aren't coming to me. What should I say "Oh it was wonderful to know you! I had such a great time!"  I don't know.  I haven't yet decided if I'll attend her funeral when it comes.  I don't think I will.  I don't want to remember illinois as a sad gloomy place to gather, and I don't have any real relationship with my uncle, and a funeral really isn't for the one who has died, it's for the family members. Gather, grieve, say goodbye, etc.  Do I really need to participate in that? I feel odd. I've never had anyone I really know die.  It's kind of a shock....  Ok, I don't feel I want to talk about this subject anymore.  AP chem test today. Holy fuck. That is all I have to say about that.  Math is going better. Hurray for me and listening in class! I got an A on my last quiz!! That's my first A on a quiz/test this year in that class! High 5 to me.  I saw Beyong Borders last Sunday. I love Angelina Jolie...but it was a depressing movie.  Well yeah.   Oh and Mrs. Holland has a cute frog.  "You can't fix shit if you suck!" - Amethyst.  I thought that was a nice quote.
