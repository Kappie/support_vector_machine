Then I have three chapters in the same class to read before next Tuesday and do an assignment with that. This is what happens when you leave things at the last minute. I love to read but this book is so boring. Oh well it needs to be done. I am going home this weekend. I can't wait! Anyways I am going to go for now. Have a good day!
