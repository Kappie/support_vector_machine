           
      4 days (and counting) till my day of birth!  Plans at this point are to go south and hang out with Brenden and the UCLA fellas for the weekend. Now that I am employed, and need to be at work Monday morning, I will have to take the train down to the OC on Saturday morning and jump back on the train Sunday afternoon to get home. I really need to drive :(  Work...is slowly getting better. First week or so I was sitting watching people work. It was supposed to be some sort of training, but all I was doing was falling asleep. Things are better now. I have been given a couple specific tasks to complete on a daily basis and it makes the day go much faster. We will see how it will turn out.  How is everyone else doing?
