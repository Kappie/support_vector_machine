Why does she feel so alone? Why does she feel so weak? Never falling tears stain her mind She cannot allow them to mar her beauty But the sadness of her expression already does To those who know What she feels She is a creature of self-condescension Blaming herself for the troubles She visits upon herself Why does she feel so empty? Why does she feel so alone? Why does she feel so weak? She silently rages at her beauty But knows she could never give it up What else has she to live for? Silks, jewelry, cosmetics.... Her anchors Yet she detests them Though she'd never admit it Why does she feel so empty? Why does she feel so alone? Why does she feel so weak? Why won't you save her? From her empty perfection                           elijah:)
