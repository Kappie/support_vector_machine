He said he's fine and I dunno if he means it or not but... I just hope me and him can still talk. I mean... I'm worried but I know that if it's really meant to be then we will get back together and it will all be okay. I mean... college isn't far away and who knows? Maybe during collge if we go near each other, we will get back together. But I know I can't give him what he needs and I need to be happy again, cause I'm not and I you can't make anyone else happy unless your happy right? So... one last word.. I made onna my friends VERY angry the other night and into today and I'm sorry... I was a jerk... LULAS     See it's burning me to hold onto this I know this is something I gotta do But that don't mean I want to What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just I feel like this is coming to an end And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you I gotta let it burn  It's gonna burn for me to say this But it's comin from my heart It's been a long time coming But we done been fell apart Really wanna work this out But I don't think   I can   change I do but you don't Think it's best we go our separate ways Tell me why I should stay in this relationship When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with I think that you should let it burn  When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over You know that it was through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn
