Again sorry if it really pissed you off. As to your advise of cutting Gunter off, well it prolly won't happen but I'll try to not pay as much attention as he wants k?  The subject is really getting old.....It's history and if you hadn't brought up the fact that it might not be over, I wouldn't have worried about it. Thankfully all of us have brains so I say history stays there and we never study it again.
