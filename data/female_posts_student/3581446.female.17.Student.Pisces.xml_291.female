I need some new clothes.  I like writing my journal entries this way. It expresses who I--- *bursts out laughing* I'm still feeling like I'm high off my ass, man! This is so great.  Asia, like, called me this morning, all sad and stuff. She asked if she could come over. Now what did I say? I said "Sure!" 'cause I love my buddies. She'll be here at 7:30.  I need to eat. I missed breakfast and lunch 'cause I slept in again.  Okay, Aaron wants me to go to the store with him.  I might not be back online.  WHITEY THE RASTA is out.  Peace.  :::I hope I take nice pictures of the firecrackers tonight. :)
