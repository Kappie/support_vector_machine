So we bought stuff and went home and did absolutely nothing. Well, we watched the Olympics and something about plastic sugery. So, since there is nothing else to say, I will tell you about my strange experiences at the Russian River with my grandparents, aunt, and cousin. So...left on Sunday morning. Boring car ride, etc. When we got there, my aunt's friend's family was already there. There were so many of them!! Like, 10 or something. Ok: Janice, Rick (14), Leonore  and boyfriend Victor, Andrea, Angela, Lorraine. Plus another family: Mark & Anne and Andrew and Steven (15 and 12). Everyone was really nice and stuff, since I had never been before. Are you getting bored? Sorry... Well, blah blah blah. I learned how to play Knock and Speed and swam a lot and got sunburned. On Tuesday, we drove to Cazadero to this bakery, but it was closed. Turns out, the bakery is literally across the street from the Cazadero Performing Arts Camp! On Wednesday, we drove to Occidental, and on the way is CYO Caritas and Westminster Woods. Amazing! And the rest of the time was rather boring. On the last night I played cards with the boys, winning against Rick (haha!!) and Steven. But not Andrew. Darn. And pissed off my cousin, who threatened to beat all of us with a watergun, which promptly broke in her hands. Rick just happened to have his faithful stickwith him, and scared her off. My cousin was watching the Teen Choice Awards too, and the boys took frequent breaks to goggle at Halle Berry, Paris Hilton, and Lindsey Lohan. Ugh...Later, Rick left his shoes in our bedroom, so we secretly stuffed them with marshmallows and returned them. He wasn't awake by the time we left, so we woke him up and told him. Afterwards, he ate a couple out of his shoes. Eeewww! I have smelled those shoes, and I don't know how we even stood putting the marshmallows in them. Sayonara...till next time.
