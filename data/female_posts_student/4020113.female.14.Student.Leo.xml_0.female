So much for my happy ending oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh ohOh oh, oh oh, oh... Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead Was it something I did? Was it something You said? Don't leave me hanging In a city so dead Held up so high On such a breakable thread  You were all the things  I thought I knew And I thought we could be  CHORUS You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh ohOh oh, oh oh  You've got your dumb friends know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do  You were all the things  I thought I knew And I thought we could be  CHORUS  It's nice to know that you were there Thanks for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one It's nice to know we had it all Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done  CHORUS X 2  oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh ohoh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh ohoh oh, oh oh, oh...   See?? the song is now in my blog!! so obsessed over it... hmm... I miss Azahar!!!
