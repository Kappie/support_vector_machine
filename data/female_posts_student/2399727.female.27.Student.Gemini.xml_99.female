While sorting through my stack of mail upon arriving home, I discovered that Fr. Nouwen's book "Can You Drink The Cup?" had arrived from Amazon, my Little White Book from the Diocese of Saginaw finally arrived and I now proudly own and wear my very own Medic-Alert necklet (which says a mouthful, I can tell you!).  Went shopping this afternoon.  Got a Panasonic digital recorder that uploads into your computer up to eight hours of continuous recording. Works for me!  I hope it works for my Psych class, too.  It's so tiny I'll have to be sure I don't lose it.  Also picked up a gift for one of my friends' birthdays.  I happened upon a CD I own and thought it would be perfect for her.   May I highly recommend Stuart Hamilton's  urlLink Vinyl Cafe ?   Very CBC, very Canadian.  You'll fall off your chair laughing.  Rounded out my trip with a little keychain flashlight to solve my dark restaurant scenario fears, and a green grading pen for Monday.  Look out 204 kiddies, I'm ready to determine if you will pass or fail in a non-psychologically damaging colour!    Other than that, quiet here.   Beautiful, un-April-like weather at 80F (26.6C).  We're not complaining!  Tomorrow is expected to be similar with a few showers thrown in for fun.  More to come...
