I am editing an experiential psychology book that a publishing company on the north side is going to publish and I have two weeks to do it. They gave me the manuscript today and I have been slow to begin with, but I think I will be able to pick up my pace now that I am more confident of what I'm doing. They said that they pay their professional editors up to $60 an hour! Yes, I know i'm not a professional, and they are giving me sort of a test run on this manuscript, so I know it will be much less than that. But this is good experience for me anyhow. I never knew that editors of books could make so much, and that's just in little Oklahoma City with an independent publisher. I love doing this. I pretend it's my own project and I just work on it constantly. This reminds me of when I was in Dr. Gipson's individualized writing class and I revised and revised my autobiography 24-7 for that class, just nit-picking at the grammar and changing the wording and the moods. I def. felt that I was doing more work than I should have been on that.   Anyway, so my interview went fine today, since they sent me home with this manuscript. At least I'm getting paid for it even if they don't like my work. And they said it could lead to other tasks in their office. I don't even have to drive to their office; I can just sit at home and do it. I guess I'll take it with me when I substitute teach. Today, I didn't work, because of the interview, but I put in 4 hours on the book today. I should have worked on it more. At least it's only like 139 pages. I can get it done in a week if I work on it for at least 5 hours a day. I don't know if I can physically do more than that.   So that's how my day went.
