Sometimes it's hard when you're so deep inside To see all you can lose in a blink of an eye Dreams could be shattered You could be gone How would I survive Cause you're where I belong My soul-believer Without you, I don't know who I would be  Underneath, I can feel you move through me Inside out, you surround me I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath You're everything I know So how could I let you go  Sometimes I listen to a voice that isn't mine I disconnect from everything inside And I have made choices And wasted all the days I could have been with you Where my heart stayed I know you've waited faithfully Blessing our love even stronger  Underneath, I can feel you move through me Inside out, you surround me I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath Oh, you're everything I know So how could I let you go  And I've been blessed For every kiss For every breath And I've been touched, By hands I trust My love is risen  Underneath, I can feel you move through me Inside out, you surround me I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath You're everything I know So how could I let you How could I let you go  I don't know why I like it, I just do. I read the email again. I really have to stop doing that. I'm so scared. So worried. So..I don't know. I don't know. All I know is that, I miss him. I miss him so much.
