Gym last period was okay, but I had to walk back up to the school from the other school, and when I got on my bus...I had an asthma attack. I was sent to the little school, because it was closer. After scaring everyone, including my mom...I started to feel better. After calming down completely I went home with my mom. It's so scary not being able to breathe. AHHHH! FUCK! Okay..Im calm again. I just hit my foot on my desk, Grr...That hurt. So, I come home and I see Tizzy's skin all over his cage. So, I thought that I'd be nice and put them in the bath tub for a little swim while I cleaned their cage. Tizzy cut up my fucking hand. I was bleeding, and wanting to swear, but my mom was home..so I refrained. Anyhow..yeah, so the water is still in my bath tub and I am contemplatning whether or not I should try again. I probably wont..I tried being nice once already. Trying twice might be over doing it. Ehh...anyhow. Im cold, and tired...and still a little bit dizzy. I think that I'm going to go take a nap.   I want to use this space to thank my wonderful mother. Hearing her voice today while struggling for air, even under the circumstance made me extremely happy. She told me not to be scared and that everything would be okay. I have to admit, hearing her say that took a whole bunch of worry off of my mind.    ~I Love You Mommy. Thankyou.~
