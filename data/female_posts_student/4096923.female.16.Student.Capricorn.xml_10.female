This is a big year for me because at last I will be graduated in highschool... but there are numerous questions floating in my mind. A question that need to be answer and that is college life. During my stayed in senior year I always ask questions to those of my friends if what is the best course? they said nursing, engineering and etc.. I took up 5 entrance examination in different universities. The 1st university is UPDILIMAn which i dont expect to passed because only those genious can passed in that school. Luckily im not ;) next is UST which is my dream school but it has a KOTA so i also dont passed. Next is CEU which i took MasCOm and Nursing, I passed the test but im not comfortable with that school. Next is FEU which I also passed the test and last Trinity College. I end up with the course of nursing in the school of FEU, which is I really have no idea that this will be my course at the end. I want to be DJ or broadcaster but this is my life... I only started my freshmen so I really have no idea what comes next. If I will go on with this course or shift, well lets see. But I hope this will be the ryt course for me.   Goodluck to the other students!vsit my site btw  urlLink ALLPANTZ
