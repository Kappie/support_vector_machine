I was quite excited because I thoroughly enjoy tagrets of all shapes and sizes.  But, alas, we arrived at the Target at 9:05, 5 minutes after it closed. I was quite disapointed because I was going to purchase a pretty alarm clock I saw in the Target ad today. My current alarm clock is broken, which obviously doesn't help me to get up.  Kinda disapointing but oh well, there is always next time.  So, instead, we went to Fred Meyer. I got photo paper and conditioner. Woot wooot. :)  Dude, I just realized how young I really am. I am 14. 14!!! I am a sopmore. Does this even make sense? I should be like an eigth grader. Haha. But, I am quite proud of my maturness. I'm not trying to brag, but I seem like a pretty mature 14 year old.  I cannot wait till I am 15. 14 just seems so YOUNG!  Like, when I tell people I am 14 they are just like "oh.." and they kinda look down on me. See, I don't really look like a 14 year old...  But yeah... 33 days till I am FINALLY 15!!
