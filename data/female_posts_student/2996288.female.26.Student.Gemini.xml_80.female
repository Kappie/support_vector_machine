I guess the most disturbing thing about all of this is that I've not really dated anybody since I broke up with him.  And he's engaged.  Granted, he needs to get married to maintain citizenship in this country...  I'm not dissing on him at all.  Part of the reason I ended it was because I knew he needed to get married, and I knew that it would not be to me.  He moved to the US as a young child, and because of stupid immigrant laws, had to be wed by 2005 (or something), or he'd have been sent back to his country of birth - whose language he isn't even fluent in any more.  I think that's just silly, but that is beside the point.  The point being that I have an ex that is getting married.  In a couple of weeks!  (He proposed officially this weekend, I guess...)  Just odd.  I feel like re-enacting the When Harry Met Sally scene, where she calls Harry and freaks out that her ex is getting married to "Kimberly."  (at least, I think it's Kimberly)  Except, I don't have a Harry, and I'm more like the Joe character in WHMS (i.e. I was the dumper, not the dumpee; and I was the one not looking to get married)  On a different note: I have seen three residents just get chewed out today.  Ahhh... the immunity of being a hapless, clueless third year med student!
