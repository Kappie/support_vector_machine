I think that my karma from saying bad things about people is coming back to haunt me as well, because I had some funky dreams last night. This will teach you to not say things about people (except nice things) unless you yourself want something bad to happen to you. Mostly, they were about how my friend was very very angry with me, Im not sure what about, but all of them ended with us never wanting to speak to each other again. I had at least two separate dreams in which this happened, most likely because I kept waking up. UNNH. 6:00 came really early this morning. I had intentions of getting to my meeting place (with my running buddy) a little early and doing an extra 2miles. That didn't happen. I got there on time, she called since she hadn't heard from me yesterday, and we met about 10min late. And then we only ran 2 miles as opposed to our normal 4. It was muggy out and my stomach hurt. Probably all the stress from thinking that Im never going to talk to my friend again. It took me quite a while this morning to realize all of that was only a dream (or 2ish). Big plans today, still need to a. clean my car out b. pack c. fix my school schedule (yay if I can get in touch w/ our dept. secretary, I need a new access # since I lost my old one and I want to register for some easy classes, ie. weekend workshops. I figure Im entitled since I have to take chem again this semester.) d. volunteer at nature center (3 hrs?) e. email one of my references I haven't been able to get in touch with yet (for my CV). f. make a list of directions so I can figure out where to go once I get to NE. g. oh and laundry. and other random stuff like meet with my bio advisor. Im so split personality-like lately, having meetings with my psych and bio profs. I think they confuse me sometimes. I forgot something that Im supposed to have done for today, so hopefully I will remember it before I have to meet with my bio advisor, but Im not counting on it.
