Then we went to Khols were I ended up buying stuff that I shouldnt have again, but I had the money and ya know...its clothes. Then I came home and got ready to go to work, which was actually alright today. Then I came home and mom told me that Chicken Express called and wanted to know if I could come in Friday. So I was like sure why not, ya know. But the thing is Im probably gonna end up working two jobs, which I really dont need to do, but ya know...its money. And I like money. So tomorrow Im going up to Cleburne to see if anyone is hiring there, JIC, because maybe Ill find a clothes store or something to work at thats really good and then I wont have to work at either of the fast food places. Which would be great. Then that afternoon if Lynn can get the boat to work, we're gonna go out to the lake. Then tomorrow me and Jake are gonna go to Arlington to the mall there to watch The Notebook and look around for a little bit and get something to eat, which is alright and everything, but I was more excited about wearing my new clothes. LOL. Oh and hopefully when he starts to work again he'll take me to this real nice place I told him about in Fort Worth, which by the way you should try sometime, its called Italian Inn something or another, super nice, so hopefully before then Ill be able to be a super nice dress. But well then saturday Im going to Fitzwaters, because monday was her birthday, so if you get a chance and ya talk to her...tell her happy birthday. Then I gotta go to work at 6. So well I guess thats all I have for right now, or atleast thats all I can think of. Till then, Later Days
