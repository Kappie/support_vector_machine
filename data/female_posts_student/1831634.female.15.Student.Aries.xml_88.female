I went downstairs and finished my chinese review packet.  then I got online and did some random crap, typed about .6 more pages of orch essay, then I had to go eat breakfast and study for chinese.  then I went to chinese.  joy.  I reviewed the entire semester of stuff in like... 30 minutes.  and I was the first person in the class to finish the test.  basically because all that stuff was stored in my short term memory and I was just like MUST... FILL... IN...  so then I finished at like... 1.  so I went and helped my mom collect money for the fall registration.  then I left chinese school at 2.15.  we went to sam's club to get some stuff to bring to jack's house.  joy.  then JACK'S HOUSE!  so fun.  we went and at first it was awkward.  cuz we were like, "hi."  "hi."  "now what?"  and then he played this war game thing... and I was just watching.  and his mom tried to feed me.  and my brother.  yeah.  HIS MOM MAKES SUCH YUMMY FOOD.  HOLY CRAP.  then at like 4, his mom was like, "let's go eat!"  so of course we all went and ate.  then while we were eating [adults in kitchen, jack, me, stephen in computer room], he showed us clips from last samauri.  as far as I can tell, the plot is something like this: tom cruise goes to japan to help national army beat samurais. tom cruise makes friends with a samurai. they have times together. samurai dies protecting tom cruise. tom cruise is a disillusioned, sad person.  puahahaha.  that was cool.  then we went up to jack's room and did... random stuff.  interesting facts about jack's room: he has a globe hanging from his ceiling in one corner. there is one wind chime and two bells hanging around that globe. there is a pufferfish in another corner. he has a drawing of sakura [really bad drawing] from a girl named eva chen from toronto. he got new, happy bedspreads.  and a happy pillow cover. he has all the books mentioned in the hum book from this year. he has a chair in his bathroom.  then we got bored of jack's room.  then we went outside!!!  OMG IT WAS SO COOL.  we went on a hike!  we were walkin and walking... then we were like creek!  and so we went to the creek bank.  we went down right by the dog park parking lot.  and we were trekking... first we saw these TINY fish.  minnow.  and we tried catching some, but it didn't work.  funny, though!  then we headed down the creek.  cuz we were like, "eh.  whatever.  let's just go."  so we climbed and ducked and waded and skirted.  then it was pretty uneventful... except I had to keep reassuring jack and steph that no, those leaves were NOT poison ivy and yes, I'm SURE.  then I found out my brother was a complete wimp.  he's going to grow up to be like chuan.  then we saw this CUTE baby duckling!  OMG!  it was so cute.  =D  then we were at this place, and there were these freaky bugs on this leaf.  we all thought it was like a siamese twin thing, cuz when we poked at it, it didn't move apart and it was sluggish and it was just... there.  so Jack was like, "I want to pick that up!"  so he got some leaves and he was just tightening this hold on it when it MOVED.  it flew and it turned out that it was actually two bugs!  and jack was like, -spring back- "WHOA IT'S TWO BUGS!  AND IT FLYS!  I'm not touching that thing!"  then about 10 steps later we realized that the bugs were probably mating.  -____-;;  so then we keep on trekking.  and then we reach this FIELD of hornet nests.  holy crap.  if we did a vietnam/south korea war movie, that was THE setting.  there were all these gnats and flies and mosquitoes and there was ALL THIS BRUSH.  and hornet nests like mad!  and all these wasps flying around, and bees, and it was just a nightmare.  we were tiptoeing around trying not to disturb anyone.  then we reach this bend and we're like Ooookay NO WAY are we continuing through all that brush.  I mean, this was like uncharted territory.  no litter, even!  and then we had to get across this tree thing, cuz there was concrete on one side and a drop on the other, so somehow we had to balance on the tree roots to keep going.  so I went first, and I almost slip and fall, so I make jack hold my hand while I jump down.  then he comes after me and he almost trips and push us both into the water.  but of course, I grabbed his shirt.  haha.  so then we have to get across the creek to the rocky side.  so I was like, "there's a stepping stone path!"  but then when I step down into the water [after climbing through this little hole thing and almost slipping and falling on my butt into the water], I realize it's that quicksand thing that isn't very solid at all.  so my shoes and socks are all wet, and jack's like I'm not going down into that.  so then he backtracks a bit and there's this peninsula thing with about this three feet strip of creek.  and he was like, "I don't think I can jump across that."  so then I get into the water and move this 10-pound rock into the middle of that little strip of water, and he just steps across.  and I'm like damn you, jack, cuz I'm all wet and you're all dry.  he says you're awesome, sunshine.  so then we continue on.  [btw, my brother followed me across the water.  but he had sandals on.  i had sneakers on.]  then we reach this HUGE stagnant pond thing.  HOLY CRAP.  there was this one place where it looked SO AWESOME, but at the same time, so gross.  I whish I could have taken a picture of the place.  it was so cool.  so then because of the stagnant water, we had to like... slide along the rocks while grabbing onto various tree roots to get across the place.  [on the other side of the creek was more brush.]  so then we're like -whew-.  and then we're in this big clearing of rocks, and we realize we're in that area behind that tree that we had to hid behind for that one scene!  so we go to our movie place, and it turns out other ppl have been there since we were last there because all that ant dirt was cleared away.  and they wore down my foothold.  geez.  then we're about to go up when we find BLACKBERRIES!  so we go blackberry picking down in there.  but then it's impossible to get up to the top along that rock wall thing.  well, except jack got up.  cuz he's jack.  and I had to hold the blackberries.  grr.  and there were bigger fish!  it was so awesome.  so then I walk all the way across [across the little waterfall!  not the rapids], and I get up after a long while.  and only using one had to hold onto stuff b/c I had to hold the blackberries.  so it was hard!  and then when I got up, jack was still helping my brother up.  then we start the long walk back.  we're like, wow.  we could have walked that distance on the sidewalk in like 5 minutes, but we spend more than an hour down there.  and we're all sweating like heck.  so then we get back and jack plays piano for us.  wow.  he's so good.  and he's like, "I practiced yesterday because I knew you guys were gonna come over today."  hahahahaha.  it was so funny.  and he said it in chinese, too.  heavily accented chinese.  so then jack stephen and I go play worms.  I'm happy to say that I owned them.  I won so many games...  lol.  and I didn't know how to play, either!  my team name was humanities, and my worms' names were sartre, kierkegard, wright, pei, warhol, and some other names I forgot.  jack did sicknesses.  my brother was just strange.  man, worms is so fun.  SOOO fun.  =)  and then while we were playing worms, his mom showed my mom this CD from this composing class jack took when he was nine or something.  I got to hear nine-year-old!jack talk!  it was soooo cute.  and HE WAS SO GOOD, EVEN AT NINE.  and he played his own compositions!  holy crap.  beyond good.  and 15-year-old!jack was so embarrassed.  lol.  and then we had to go home.  =(  and I found out that jack WAS planning to go to six flags, and the only reason he didn't go was because of chuan.  I'm super pissed at chuan now.  for being such a freaking ninny.  god.  i wanted to kill him.  I still do.  this is the maddest I've ever been at him.  anyway.  then I found out that jack tells his parents a ridiculous amount about me.  probably even more than i tell my parents about him.  which is quite a bit.  no jack stories?  alrighty then.  jack is going to learn chinese this summer cuz his parents are like "sunshine knows chinese!" and jack's like "sunshine knows chinese!"  it's so hilarious.    =)
