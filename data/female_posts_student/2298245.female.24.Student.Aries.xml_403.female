But today will be an exception to the general rule,  urlLink for after reading this , I gained a little more respect for him:   Here at the University of Toledo on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Kerry bowed his head for a moment of silence in Mr. Reagan's honor and edited a tribute to the late president into his keynote speech at the commencement of Bedford High School in nearby Temperance, Mich.   Ignoring their obvious differences - Mr. Kerry's first flash in the Senate was leading the investigation into the Reagan administration over Iran-contra - the Democrat praised the Republican as a "modern giant" who provided "the voice of America in good times and in grief."   "Because of the way he led, he taught us that there was a difference between strong beliefs and bitter partisanship," Mr. Kerry told the 372 Bedford graduates and their friends and relatives. "He was our oldest president, ladies and gentlemen, but he made America young again."  Lauding Mr. Reagan's speech 20 years ago on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, as well as his leadership after the Challenger explosion, Mr. Kerry said the American spirit "wears no political label.''  "In service to others and yes, in sacrifice for our country, there are no Republicans; there are no Democrats; there are only Americans and patriots," Mr. Kerry told the class, which includes the largest number of Bedford graduates in a single class, 26, ever to enlist in the military.   These are thoughtful words, and poetic ones.  He has also postponed two large, star-studded fund raisers that had been scheduled for this week, possibly at great expense to his campaign.  He didn't need to do it this way and he did, and for that, I graciously give him the utmost credit.
