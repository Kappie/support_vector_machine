(SS, Study Hall, Band, and Language) Yesterday sucked though...I have all my "hard" classes that day. (Study Hall(I know..not tough..it gets worse), Biology (we dissected the poor froggies! ;.;), French (that class is evil...), and Geometry (triple the evilness...*mutter*))  But yeah...Jeremie doesn't have ta work tonight..so I'm gonna go try and go to his house...cuz I won't be able to see him tomorrow until he drops me off at home, then work, and then back at home after work. And those will be really short periods of time...o.O ^^;. lol. I'm such a dork.  Anywayz...I get my paycheck tomorrow!!! *dances* chaahaaaaa!! lol. I can't wait for that...cuz then I'll make my dad take me to get it cashed..then talk Jeremie into coming with me to the mall, and then we'll go back to his house (hopefully) around noon to paint! ^^ yush..we're gonna paint his walls. yay! color! ^^;  But that's all for now...baiobaio!
