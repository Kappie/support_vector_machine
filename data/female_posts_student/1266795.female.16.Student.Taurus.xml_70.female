(Just being hard on ya!)   I'm now 16. YAY! Jane surprised me by coming to VBS (fun, fun, right, Jane?), and during the opening songs, Linda had all the kiddies sing "Happy Birthday" to me as Mom wheeled out my cake. HEE! That was so cute! We had some of it during snack time.  (More sugar for the kids! - Ash)   Afterwards, we all went out (all meaning Ash, Jane, Marten, Jonah, Nathan, Holly and Adrienne) to Bazbeaux's for pizza. YUM! Then we all went home. :( However, Ash went with me later that night to the kids' showcase, where our VBS kids sang songs and did skits.   Well, I played with the video camera and I managed to get one of the three songs that our kids sang, if Marten, Jonah, and of course, Nathan want to see it. I had all three but I accidentally copied over it. :-( I'm slow, remember????? Ah well.  And Ash also got some footage of Sarah all hyped up on sugar, singing and dancing with "ze French birthday frog." That could so easily be used for blackmail, Ash.   I was thinking the same thing...  Then Ash stayed the night unexpectedly. (I love it when that happens.)   When do I ever spend the night expectedly?  True. Then today, Ash and I manned our garage sale for a few hours before going out and checking out the 28 other sales around the neighborhood. For once, I managed to spend less than I earned!   Aren't we proud?  Yes, we are. I earned $35.75 from the sale (Ash earned that, only minus 35 bucks), but I only spent $28 at the garage sales. :) I bought an "egantic" (I'm taking your word, Nathan) stuffed gorilla for my grandfather's birthday next month and a WWII pocketwatch from Russia, along with other things. Ash wants the pocketwatch. Too bad for her. I like it. Plus, I paid for it.   Fine then, be that way. I'm still paying you all money, when I get some.  No, you're not.  Birthday Gifts: $50 from grandparents $50 from aunt  uncle Jane: fake Louis Vuitton bag!!! :P (grin) Ashley: French bag w/ "Love" CareBear, fairies, pizza coupons, and a card w/ an upcoming pedicure appointment (yet to be scheduled) Jonah:  The Truth  by Terry Pratchett Linda: a 30-year-old print from Japan signed by the artist, a book with pictures of the Eli Lilly collection of Chinese art, 30 rubber stamps of Chinese nature symbols Adrienne: Hello Kitty cup, hat, and pillow (that was signed by all at Bazbeaux's)   Sarah happy. :)  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"
