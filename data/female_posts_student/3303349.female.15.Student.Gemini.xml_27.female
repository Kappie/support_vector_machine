And I am sure that my scores are gonna reflect it. But tomorrow is the last day of school! I am kind of depressed because i actually really like school and I like seeing my friends everyday and stuff like that. But I get to go on Monday at 8 in the morning for drivers ed so it will be like I never left. I got to go driving today with my dad. It was so amasingly fun. I learned; don't take corners at full speed,  watch for curvy roads, I CAN go 50 mph without hyperventelating, and to always use your turn segnal, especially when changing lanes. i was so amused. I love driving. And soon I will have my lisence and will be able to do it legaly!! I'm gonna buy alot of ice cream then and chaufer alot of kids. Yeah...well I will talk to you on the other side of the last day of my freshman year!! Holy cow!
