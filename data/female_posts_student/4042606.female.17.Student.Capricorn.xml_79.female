I know they will lose but, it is better then getting high or drunk at a friends house... Wait a minute no it isn't, yet I am still going to the baseball game, because I don't want to ditch my friend Krystal. I hope the woman I will not mention updates the website while I am out. Or I hope Michelle will take some time and drop a note or to on the site.
