The next couple weeks are gonna be soooo hectic, but i'm so glad school's out. Now I'm looking forward to going gypsy cow tipping in Holkum, Mississippi...with a book burning. And fat suits. Oh it'll be fun. I think I should head on to bed now. I have to be at Stephen's early and then go to Caitlin's water shindig. But i'll be seein ya.   Post Script- Ali, we still havent rented Good Burger...what the crap is wrong with us?
