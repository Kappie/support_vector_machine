I'm in Kansas this weekend because my brother is getting married.  Tomorrow.  He's getting married tomorrow.  Tomorrow I will have a sister-in-law.  WHOA!  This is big!  He's really anxious... he's called the house pretty much everyday for the past two weeks... my Mom asked him if he had 'cold feet.'  I don't think he ever answered her.  ; )  Anyhow, I will be back on Sunday... which will be good, because then I can enjoy the rest of my 'weekend' at home, and sleep in on Monday for a change!  :-)  Talk to ya'll later...
