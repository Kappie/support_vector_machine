No more papers, prelims are over, time for some maxin' and relaxin'.  And on Thursday me and Matt go to NYC!!! :)  It becomes time to catch up on the email I've been putting off due to prelims and papers and the like.  Of course, for me, putting off emails means it's only been two weeks since I emailed people, not like three months, but whatever.  In fact, I think I'll go and do that now!
