She too needed a reason for her young daughter to hate her when she came home from every first day of school, during which i met at least half a dozen teachers who never learned french.  each one would fumble through the first syllable: "chick...I'm sorry, how do you pronounce that?"   "shi-coin.  like an 'S'" "oh, that's right.  chick-oin.  lovely!  so french!" at which point i would give up, and feel old Zepherine (great great grand something or other) and Madeline (very early ancestor, who was probably one of the only ones who actually came from France) rolling in their graves.  had they suffered the same problems from ignorant english-speaking fools?   besides my mother's supposed francophilia (or post-natal insanity?) another thing I always held against her was the length.  jacqueline has ten letters, chiquoine nine, so you would think she'd pick something like ann or Lois as my middle name - or, hell, forget it all together.  but no, its the reliable, ever-popular Elizabeth.  not french - too bad - but nine letters.  Twenty-eight letter names are not easy for budding five-year-old readers to spell and memorize.  yet, somewhat miraculously, i learned how to do it, because every book i could get my hands on had JACQUELINE written in huge, scribbly, occasionally backwards lefty scrawl on the first page.
