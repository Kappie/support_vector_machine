My ankles gave in right when I was giving a pizza to a customer so I fell and so did the pizza almost. I got yelled at cuz Geri kept asking for a kiss jsut cuz he gave me a ring [which broke anyways] but I didn't give him a kiss jsut smiled and Bob the owner thought I was flirting w/Geri so I got yelled at when it was the other way around completely like dude not intersted at allll, whatever. It's all good. The job's not as bad as I used to say so I'm not gonna complain, it was just a long night. I came home and watched Secret Window, pretty good but not as good as I was expecting. Not much left to say, gotta sleep early tho cuz I have church in the morning, argh -camille-      *happy anniversary ='\
