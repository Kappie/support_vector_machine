My name is Jillian and my family has owned a Beach house in the beautiful  urlLink Seaside, Florida  since I was four years old.  Since then, a yearly tradition has arisen when we take at least a 2-week-long vacation there in June, right after school gets out.  For a long time, it was only my family and Natalie's family, but after Nat and I went to camp and met the infamous  Phileda , we decided that she should come along as well!  And as for Virginia, she is a wonderful product of my move to Atlanta, GA, and of my Jr. High school Pace Academy.  She is my best friend from Hotlanta, and is a fantastic addition to our wonderful tradition!  All four of these fantastic girls have been granted access to this blog, and hopefully will be posting their own thoughts, ideas, and stories on this board, for all of y'all to enjoy!  That's all for now!
