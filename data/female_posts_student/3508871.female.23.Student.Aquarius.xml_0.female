There's no decent asian restaurants here either, there's about two chinese restaurants but they serve GREASE! hhaha so yeah, go figure. Well today, Travis and I have planned to go car shopping,location: just outside of Portland. ONe thing I learned! Boy those car dealers! They freaked the hell out of us! Pushing us till no end to buy a car! Ok enough of my exclamtion marks!!!! hahahahahah. Finally we got out of that place and went straight to TODAI RESTAURANT located in Portland, ORegon. Which is just an hour's drive away from Hood River. The car dealer's place was just 10 minutes away from Portland anyways. I was absolutely hungry, we were negotiating for two hours...travis was nagotiating, i was just sitting there just couldn't believe what comes out of that dealer's  mouth. Alright when we got to TODAI, server told us that TODAI will be closing in 1 hour and 5 minutes. Man, I was like, yea give it to me, I am ready for this race....hahaha. Todai is a buffet Japanese restaurant and apparently it is pretty famous. So you can imagine, I am a sushi freak...I was just all over the place! AHI, MAckeral, Cali roll...yellowtail,tokyo ramen...and more! boy I was eating everything...20 minutes later, Travis and I rubbed our tummies...WE ARE GETTING THERE! So yeah, ANDREW...YOU MISSED OUT MAN! TODAI CONQUORS! Wish we could take some pictures of this place and send them to all my friends. hahaha...well kids...next time. We finished off our meal with CREPES. PHOO WEE, by that time our crepes were deveoured...I felt my belly was about to burst out into the public! Yeah imagine that, would not be a good sight. "People will be like, what the heck is wrong with this asian chic?! Oh it is one of those again, who just can't handle pressure when it comes to a place like TODAI"    Well everyone, since Japanese food are usually expensive everywhere you go. But TODAI is definitely "THE PLACE" to go for JAPANESE FOOD especially when you're a SUSHI FREAK and you're still a STUDENT who just wants to pay cheap and eat LOTS!   End of FOOD REVIEW...till next time....TODAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIII......oh i mean BAAANNNNNNNZAAAAAAAIIIIIIIII!
