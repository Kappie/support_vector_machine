Absolutely nothing. We went through what is DNA, how to extract it and blah blah blah. And I spend $110 on it. And what did the instructor said? " It cost $400 for the whole kit" So, for our course, she gave a discount izzit? Anyway, the course did not end here, tomorrow we have to return to school. What we did today is to extract out the PURE DNA and cool it for tomorrow's 'GREEN' EXPERIMENT..... And the whole process took us more than an hour or so AND MORE! We put in solution to prevent bacteria, or to break up OR to 'eat' it up.... And then we centrifudge, centrifudge AND centrifudge for a hundred times before we could get a pure solution which its amount did not even reached to my pinky. And the Bio lab was so hot and stuffy. And in order to entertain ourselves, the boys decided to twist the tap's head upwards instead of the normal position during break time. And what they did was to turn the tap on and off with skillful hands and the end product is that you will see a so- called 'fountain' that spurted out water. It was beautiful in a way, providing you did it when the teacher is not looking and you don't mind wetting your classmates' table and chairs and the ceiling too. So, that's was what we fooled around this afternoon.... Oh, I also wanted to buy FIRST Magazine but I was so tried and exhausted even though I had the money... The front page is Charlie's Angels and The Hulk... Check it out.
