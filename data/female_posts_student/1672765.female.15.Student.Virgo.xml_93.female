"Cold Cash and Colder Hearts" by Thrice  		They are sick, they are poor 		And they die by the thousands and we look away 		They are wolves at the door 		They are not going to move us or get in our way 		Cause we don't have the time 		Here at the top of the world 		Cause we're feeling alright 		Here at the top of the world 		 		We hold our own by keeping our hearts cold 	 		Different god, darker skin 		They are just not a burden that we'd like to bear 		They are living in sin 		There are so many reasons for us not to care 		 		Cause we're feeling alright 		Here at the top of the world 		Yeah, we're doing just fine  		Here at the top of the world 	 		We've learned that money matters most 		So we keep our cards held close 		Here at the top of the world 		 		We hold our own by keeping our hearts cold 		We learned what matters most so we keep our hearts cold 		They are no one 		They are no where 		They are not our problem 		Not worth saving 		Nonexistant if we keep our hearts cold  		They are no one 		They are no where
