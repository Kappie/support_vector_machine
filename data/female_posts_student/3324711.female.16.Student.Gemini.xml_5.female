I forgot to call Lydia cause I went for a run with Daniel and [sort of] Matt and shes gonna be pissed at me tomarrow.. but the run was awesome. I mean Im totally out of shape and its terrible but its great to hang out with Daniel and Matt again..I forgot how much I missed them all [sniff] no Im not that emotional but theyre great.  Anyway I have nothing left to say, so goodnight.   Listening To: nothing at all.
