She was like 'I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!' I'm like... I don't see a phone or anything attatched to your head so I'm kind of scared." -Jared  "Some say that it's free Can you see? Its in me Run the race You're a disgrace In my face Pick your nose Touch my toes Bees in the trees Fighting the mighty seas Or can we go Away in the snow To Mexico Or maybe row In a boat Wearing a coat In the moat." -Alex's poem for Creative Writing
