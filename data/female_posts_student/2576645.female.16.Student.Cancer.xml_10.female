I went to Chicago on Friday to see Hairspray with Carly Jibson in it!(our very own hometown celebrity and MS alumni)  All  I can say is this:    IT FREAKIN KICKED ASS!!!!!  Those four little words are among many (like marvelous, excellent, surburb, exciting, awe-inspring and magnificent) that could describe the awesome perfromance I witnessed on Friday.  I have seen many plays in my lifetime (I can't even begin to count them) but Hairspray above all was the best.   THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!  Where else could you stand up and shake your groove thing at the end?   Not 'Les Miserables', I'll tell ya that much.  I love anything retro.....I just can't help it....this was the perfect play for me. Between the swingin costumes and lingo ('thats afro-tastic!!') and the hot guys (who you could totally tell were gay, but hey, a girl can dream!) I was in my own 60s heaven!  Go to the Hairspary website and tell them Katherine sent you.  Maybe you'll get front row seats!   urlLink
