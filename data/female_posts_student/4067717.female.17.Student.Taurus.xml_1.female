I think I will really enjoy that book.  Just watched MacGyver. He's still hot.  The tree-painting at BGS has been moved to tomorrow. This is actually better for me, since I don't have to work tomorrow (for once-- I swear I work way more than every other Sunday). I forgot to ask if Mrs. B has paint brushes and a drop cloth and everything, so I hope she does.  So, um...that's about it. Dunno why I wrote this, just bored I guess.
