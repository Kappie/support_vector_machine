And because of everyone talking about the subject and fighting stupidly who deserved more has more pity.The fat man's son was already dead and he created this fantesy world so he wouldn't feel bad. And while he was talking, more feelings keep adding up inside and he's holding it with everything he has not to burst. bringss back memmoeries.At one point you will eventually brake. He realized that his so was really gone and not coming back ever, when the woman asked him. and when you brake with all that he has boddled inside, that's the worst thing that you can experience.
