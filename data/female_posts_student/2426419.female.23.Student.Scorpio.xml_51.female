Around the 1950s and 60s, an art movement called "Pop Art" came about to blur the distinction and to say that low art was cool.  The most famous was Andy Warhol with his Campbell's Soup cans.  I offered the distinction because low art is hard to defend with questions of adding to God's story.  I mean how does  urlLink Spongebob  fit? I don't know, but I like him!
