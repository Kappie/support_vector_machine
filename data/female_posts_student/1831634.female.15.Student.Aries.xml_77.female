Unless Kerry brings his computer to China and lets me update on it.  But then he'd know the blog address.  Oh, woe is me.  Did you know you can update your blog by email?  I think I shall try that sometime.  It is 2am now, and I shall not go to sleep.  But then I'll miss the movie on the plane.  So perhaps I should go to sleep.  Yes.  I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.  I ought to go put that lotion in my bag now cuz I won't remember tomorrow morning.  -sigh-  I'm all depressed now.  I shall miss my family oh so much.  Eileen and Kerry!  Think of fun times with Eileen and Kerry!  Aaaah.  College shall be an entire YEAR without parents!  How will I cope??  Let's not think that far ahead.  For now... farewell, true loves.  =)
