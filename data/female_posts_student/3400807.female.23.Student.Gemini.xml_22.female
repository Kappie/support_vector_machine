What is it with me these last few days?!?!  

"I am I, Don Quixote, 
The Lord of La Mancha, 
My destiny calls, 
And I go! 
And the wild winds of fortune 
Will carry me onward, 
To withersoever they blow!"  

 urlLink This ? I last saw this in my junior year of high school! I should have graduated from college a year ago. So it's been about   six years   since I've seen this. And I still remember the  urlLink lyrics ?!?!? I am so very, very weird.
