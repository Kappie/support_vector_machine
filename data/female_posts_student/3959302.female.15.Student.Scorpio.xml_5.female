"QuIeT LiFe"  This is land very far from you I never can touch your face This is the land far from happy So am I, no matter where I go pretty landscape, fresh coffee Quiet life I longed for is my enemy now "What's wrong with you, babe?" ask an old goat I forgot everything even a bitter smile  In a dream, darling you stroke my arms and say "It's O.K. It's O.K." but I knew it doesn't last so long So I try to dream of you every night And I try to hold you every time  This is the land very far from you I never can hear your voice This is the land far from success So am I, no matter how you bet perfect starry sky, grand piano Quiet life I longed for is my enemy now Birds started for you left me here I forgot everything even your way of waving  In a dream, darling you stroke my arms and say "It's O.K. It's O.K." In a dream, darling you stroke my hair and say "It's O.K. It's O.K." but I knew it doesn't last so long So I try to dream of you every night And I try to hold you every time  Quiet life Quiet life
