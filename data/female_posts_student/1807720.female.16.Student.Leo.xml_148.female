Though I was doing really good with the healthy eating, I kind of ate some chocolate this weekend and "real" food.  So yeah I gained a little bit back, but I still weigh less then I did before.  Besides tomorrow it's back to healthy eating, and I'm going to try really hard again to loose some weight.  Just cause I blow my "diet" once, doesn't mean I have to let it drag me down.  Today was nice to have off, though after the gals left I studied Bio for the remainder of the day and then my mom came home, we watched a movie, ate supper, then I dropped off the movie and drove to Safeway to get more fruit.  Did I mention I crave fruit right now.  I am deprived!!  Strangely enough when I eat fruit the weight comes off, eat bread anything "carbs" then it just adds up.  Edi and I are going out for dinner on Wednesday night too, cause I am done my English and the Bio test is that day so I most likely won't have a lot of homework if any.  Though I am trying to loose weight, I will probably just get a salad.  Besides I will keep things cheap.  It just means that he spends less money.  And rule of thumb: guys are cheap.  My goals at the moment/for future include:   -Get Drivers License -Score 80% or higher on Bio test -Get over 80% in my English novel unit -Loose Weight -Get someone to nominate me for Habits of Mind because I DESERVE it and last semester no one nominated me -Make honors with Distinction -Make a new friend -Be a better friend -NOT get into any arguments -Look sexy -Have lots of fun with Edi -Maybe kiss Edi if it's right -Take up a new extra-curricular activity -Have a better attitude about things -I have TOO MANY goals to list!
