I think I am gonna get him a shirt from Nordstrom because it's the Mens Half Yearly Sale! Wahoo. To bad none of the stuff I want will be on sale..well it still might. *wonders how long the Womens Half Yearly Sale lasts*  Doodle doodle.  I had a really bad sleep last night. :'(   I can't sleep with braces!!!!!! Grrrr.
