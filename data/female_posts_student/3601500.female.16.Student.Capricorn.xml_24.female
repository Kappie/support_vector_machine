She's such a twit (and now spends her time watching FMA episodes. I approve). Anyway, the little girl told me that her sister was only staying for the summer because she was to complete her 12th grade back in Kingston. She's, however, probably taking the driving course with me (and my friend). I'm already sad without knowing her, but I guess I could make friends with the guy. >.>  If what my sister says is true, he might be a bishie. o-o  Anyway, while I was away at my friend's cottage I learned to knit. Interesting eh? I have to buy some wool and needles and start making a Slytherin scarf.
