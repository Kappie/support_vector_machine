He and I talked all night about all the funny things we did in the past like strip down to our underwear and go swimming in a pond (while very drunk of course) this event took place in the early spring so there was still a thin layer of ice on this pond it was very cold that night... We then walked back to our friends place (walking thorough a small town) half naked... I laughed so hard last night I gave myself a headache. I had so much fun hanging out with Ryland... One entire summer hanging out with him consisted of getting drunk and going to taco bell or at least that's all I remember of it.  anyway more reminiscing to come he and I are going to hang out on Saturday night.
