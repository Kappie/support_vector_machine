I haven’t talked to him in a few days and I am worried I wish he would just call. They have the day off today, this I found out from Danielle Barber, her husband is stationed with Jesse. They got to go to a sporting event yesterday, over 2000 seats were donated to the base and a bunch of the guys from the 319th went, I am betting Jesse went to, I wouldn’t have blamed him. I guess I am upset because he didn’t call to tell me about this. Danielle told me that a bunch of guys went to a hotel last night, but she asked if Jesse went and her husband told her no because they had to go with their battle buddies and Jesse’s BB was ill. She also told me that a bunch of the guys were going out today to find a mall or something… I just wish he would call home. Sometimes I feel like he doesn’t care that he isn’t here, that he doesn’t even miss me. I mean what does it take to pick up a phone and call home? I am here packing up our lives alone and he is out having fun. He just makes me so mad. I think about him every day, wondering how he is, is he feeling ok, wondering what sort of things did he do that day and still I hear nothing because his cell phone died? That is not an excuse! There are payphones and calling cards… I even told him to call me collect if he needed to. I guess I just needed someone to vent to even if it is to my BLOG, not like anyone reads this thing any way. I am having such a hard time I wish he could just pick up the phone for once and ask me how I am doing.   Please phone just ring….
