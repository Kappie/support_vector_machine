Dew so that probably won't be accomplished.  My eye hurts for some reason...  It hurts whenever I blink.  Tomorrow's my birthday and I want a digital camera.  The one we have now is too big and clunky and the photos aren't the best quality and the zoom in/out button rarely works anymore.  Plus tomorrow's my birthday!  Todd's concerned with spending that much money on a camera when he has spent more money on cues and other miscellaneous pool stuff than I would spend on a camera.  Not fair.  I probably won't get it.  Oh well, it's not like we need to spend that type of money on me anyway.  There are other, more important things that it could be spent on.  Like pool.  *rolls eyes*
