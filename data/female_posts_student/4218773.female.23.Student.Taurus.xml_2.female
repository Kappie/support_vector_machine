Following the examples of friends, upon the request of my parents, and in the interest of avoiding mass-emailings, I have decided to create a "blog" (a web log). This way I can keep you up to date on what I'm experiencing.       As I write this, I'm preparing to leave for southern Mexico on Sunday, August 15th. Once there I will immediately begin a three week long orientation period. This will include Spanish refresher courses, history and culture lectures, as well as a host stay. I still don't know exactly what I'll be doing once I start my work down there. I have put in my request to work with a local human rights organization, and there are quite a few in Oaxaca City, but I still don't know which one I will be placed with. After the orientation period is over I will move into an apartment in the city where I will stay for a year with 2 other volunteers, both about my age.       I hope this blog will keep everyone informed about where I am, what I'm doing, and who I'm meeting. I'm going to miss everyone terribly, please email often...but I'm really excited to embark on this amazing journey. I'll see you all in a year!           urlLink eleanorplewis@hotmail.com        urlLink eleanorpiercelewis@yahoo.com
