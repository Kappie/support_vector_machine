Ok, not the dead, but at least the 3-months-with-minimal-contact-to-australia phase I was going through... so I have found a solution, a blog (short for web-log) here I can post messages... or if I'm feeling too lazy to type then I can post audio messages so you can hear my beautiful voice again!   So... what has katie been up to in the past 3 months? Hmm... probably too much to write in one simple post, so I'll just skim over the highlights...  1. Euro tour, 18 days in a bus with 57 other exchange students going around europe... my fav. countries being austria and italy...  2. Survived a near death experience involving a faulty safety harness and a 20 story drop on a ride called the 'the golden tour' (or 'den guld t√•rn')... but yes I am alive and in one piece!  3. Moved host families, my new family are sooooo sweet :D   4. Met some of the coolest people in the world... one of whom is going home on saturday :'(  5. FINALLY got around to watching Pirates of the Carribean... very cool movie and I highly recommend it  6. Um... thats about it... I'm sure I've done lots of other cool stuff but I just can't think of it at the moment but when I think of all the other cool euopean things I've done I'll be sure to tell you...  OH and on the 4th of July I'm going back to Austria and the czech republic again with my hosties, w00t!  Anyway, gotta get a move on!  Love yas all, Kaz
