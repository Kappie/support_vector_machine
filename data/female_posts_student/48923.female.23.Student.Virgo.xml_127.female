(You really ought to read this book, it is about the history of recorded music and how the history repeats itself in the fear of new technology.)  just so you know, i am a big sucker for bad techno  (as well as bad bad bad pop... y'know the music i should be ashamed to like because it is an overplayed evil song with great pop hooks.)  and i love the idea of dance parties and music worthy of dance parties.  (actually, now that my little sister has left the apartment and i've returned to being healthy my apartment has returned to Dance Party ydeleK!)    thus, i've speculated that i would love disco if just given the chance...     urlLink  Take Me to the Disco    in launch's amazing prediction of my realization that disco might actually not suck, it plays a fantastic plastic machine's song that i haven't heard for awhile  (and had always bothered me due to a song sample that i can't place, but this is me going off the music nerdom scale. the lowest/highest music nerdom point was during the roadtrip to washington dc where F. and I managed to spend several hours listing off bands in alphabetical order)    and i think i might be in love with the disco dancer in the video. i speculate that perhaps disco might be a hidden gem of coolness, and instead of focusing on actual disco music i turn to something more awesome than awesome....     urlLink  Learn to Disco Dance    (what language is this? matt k. is it austrian, german, or something else?)  if anything this post might show that i've clearly lost my mind due to my recent illness. because this instructional video which is in someother language   i don't understand  , has been watched by me countless times... complete with me dancing along to the really really bad music at the end.  it is amazingly wonderful video from the 70's with an older guy (in his 40's?) and a heavily made-up woman who seems to be channeling a different decade. i'm slightly confused as to why the disco party at the end of the intructional part of the video are all coupled dancers, as i thought disco was the first non-couple dance... but i still love the dance party at the end of the video.  i wish i knew where this video came from, and something about the awesome soundtrack. as i do realize that i have actually heard popularized "disco" songs  (now that i've researched   urlLink  allmusic    for some disco musical tips)  but i'd really like to listen to some club disco and see if it is still dance inspiring.
