(Fortunately, none have gone further than this.) Oh, I should probably mention that my brother just finished sixth grade. See, neither VW nor I have ever  dated , let alone made out. Is this sad? It sort of seems like it must be. But don't get me wrong--I'm not actually  bothered  by this realization. It just kind of made me think. Then again, Andy also made several mentions of girls liking so-and-so Tuesday, but the next day, liking someone else, and such. How can these people's feelings fluctuate so drastically day to day? So, in that way at least, I guess VW and I are a little more sane than most of the McKinley student body. Maybe a lot more sane.  Today, VW and I got up early (around eight...which isn't really early, but it's not exactly pleasant when you've stayed up until about two) and went to my grandparents' house. Ah, my grandparents are insane. My grandma's under five feet with short frizzy hair, and she's...insane. That's truly the only way to put it. Anyway, maybe I'll write about my grandparents sometime else. Maybe not. But now, more about my day.  We went over to work on sanding my new bed which my grandpa recently finished building for me. This took only about a half an hour. So we spent the rest of the day sitting at the computer, skimming random blogs (in one case, more than skimming), and being bored out of our minds. At around noon, though, my mom picked us up and took us back to my house.  A couple hours later, we decided that we wanted to work on writing a song for our band (if anyone has suggestions for a band name, tell me). I have a piano, but we got it very used and very old, therefore it kind of sucks. So we decided we wanted to go to VW's house instead. The problem was that I didn't have my key and therefore could not lock the door.  How to escape? , we pondered. We finally devised a plan.  Okay, so it was more of an impulse than a plan. And I have this way of making things sound a lot more exciting than they really are. So don't be disappointed. We spent about a half hour forcing open the old, rusty, jammed door in the basement. I'll give a condensed version, since I sort of want to finish this soon: We finally opened the door, only to end up back at my house within the next hour. We didn't even  go  to VW's house. Oh, and at one point we crawled through the window at my dad's house...twice, actually... Yeah. That's all.   There's a dead animal in the frying pan on my oven. It looks disgusting.  Current... Thoughts: none.
