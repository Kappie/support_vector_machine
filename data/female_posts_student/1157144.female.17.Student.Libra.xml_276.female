Heh, umm, we went to Maggie's to suprise her, but she wasn't home. We went to Brian's and ate and talked about stuff, and THEN we went to the park where Billy and Ryan proceeded to attempt to light their farts on fire.  Unfortunately, neither of them got a good one saved up, and it got cold so we met up with Jessie and all 6 of us sat in her Jeep in the parking lot. At this point, we were all uncomfortably shoved in the Jeep as it was chilly outside, with a very gaseous Billy.  Not a good combination. To make matters worse, two cop cars pulled up and stopped these 2 guys that were there, and gave them drug tests, etcetera. We just sat in the car, because we didn't want to look like we were escaping, but we couldn't have Jessie drive us without her 6 months. So finally, we start getting out, but they tell us to stay inside the car.  A third cap pulls up, and this whole time we are like "well we aren't doing anything wrong" but we are all thinking of scenarios and bad situations and where to put the matches and things. So the cop comes up to the window and all he asks is if we know anything about the 2 guys and if they broke into the school and whatnot.  It was a amiable conversation except when one of them asks "None of you guys are runaways from the school, are you?" and Ryan says a joke about running away, and at first they thought he really was an escapee. It was quite eventful.   I'll never forget that one...
