I can say that my summer is over because as soon as i come back, I start school the next 3 days, so barely have time for school ssummer again, that is a promise, i could never go hang out with my friends because of that badhopping, and to even see my *cough* boyfriend, oh lol jp, ( that makes me laugh everytime i do that) and my friends that i wont get to see as often. I am never babysitting during the  little boy who could have took care of his own self. I will never have a suumer like this again, well i hope i wont cause this one reall sucked, next summer im doing wut a 15 yr. should be doin during the summer, im goin 2 parties, im hangin out everynight, im goin 2 the movies, im going swiming and whatever else i can think about doin that wont( that  EXCLUDES SEX AND DRUGS ) i ahd to put that in bold so i can just let everyone know that so they wont get any ideas. I am so looking forward to the next summer i am going to make that summer the best one i had. I might as well forget about this one and start looking forward to school ( oohhhh god) everybody pray 4 me lol jp.
