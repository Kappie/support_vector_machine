I'm on okay terms with him right now, but I'm still mad at him. And worried about other things.   We went to the LSU/Mizzou game. That was a lot of fun.  My parents are out of town this weekend. My grandmother is staying with my brother, sister, and me. It's pretty fun.  I'm having a party for the ND/Sikeston basketball game when they play in Sikeston. I think it's December 19th? Or something like that. Spread the word! Hehe.  Wanna see my Christmas list? I know you do. Haha. My grandmother had me make one last night. It's not very big this year.
