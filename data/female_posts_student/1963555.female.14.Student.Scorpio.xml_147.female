Then Ryan, Jared, and Travis came over, then Fred. But right before Ryan and his crew left they all stood infront of Fred and one by one gave him the finger, it was so gay, but funny...  *This song has been in my head all week!  FRANZ FERDINAND LYRICS  "Take Me Out"  So if you're lonely  You know I'm here waiting for you  I'm just a crosshair  I'm just a shot away from you  And if you leave here  You leave me broken, shattered, I lie  I'm just a crosshair  I'm just a shot, then we can die   I know I won't be leaving here with you   I say don't you know  You say you don't go  I say... take me out!   I say you don't show  Don't move, time is slow  I say... take me out!   If I move this could die If I move this could die I want you...to take me out!  I say you don't know  You say you don't go  I say... take me out!   I know I won't be leaving here (with you)  I know I won't be leaving here  I know I won't be leaving here (with you)  I know I won't be leaving here with you  I say don't you know? You say you don't know I say take me out  If I wink, this can die If I wane, this can die I want you to take me out  If I move, this could die If I move, this could die Come on, take me out  I know I won't be leaving here I know I won't be leaving here I know I won't be leaving here I know I won't be leaving here with you
