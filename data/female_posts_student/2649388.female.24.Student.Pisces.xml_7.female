I eventually decided to post it without much editing, so you get to peek into my unguarded/heedless thoughts --   -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Ok ... I guess I haven't blogged for a LONG time, and I probably should post something, just so that people won't think that, I have completely abandonded the site and stop visiting ... Not that it matters anyway.    I am not sure what I want to write.  Honestly, I m posting simply because I got bored of waiting for gcc to compile (compile as if, compiling gcc itself ... configure, make bootstrap, make, make install...)  Somehow time flies by when you are busy. Spring is finallly here.  (At one point, I thought that Spring forgot to visit Cambridge ...)  Time is counting down.  All the sudden, I realized that, I have been in MIT for almost a year.  Thinking back in time, when I first stepped into this campus, I was full of doubt and wondering about the uncertainties in life.  Now a year has passed, and it seems like nothing has changed at all.  Ok.  Maybe one thing has changed -- I used to think that, all these doubts are just a side-effect of the transition phase and that they will eventually go away as time passes.  Now, I am not even so sure about that anymore ...
