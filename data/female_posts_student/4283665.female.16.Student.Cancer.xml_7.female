I started off my day late, had shower, did nothing. Picked up some pictures, fought with mother who was being very unreasonable, went to see michelle, walked her to Alena, saw nicky, she told me to suck it, looked at shoes, looked at michelles new shoes, stopped by the video store on the way back to see nicky, stared at the homeless woman with the beard across the street, went home, fought some more with mother, now im here. Can anyone tell me about menopause? i could use the info, it could explain alot.
