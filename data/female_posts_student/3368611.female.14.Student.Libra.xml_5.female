In other words, I'm bored out of my skull...     CURRENT EVENTS    1) This girl at school ( Amyra ) threatened to follow me home if I don't give her my B2K tattoos... I'm scared now...  2) We got our test results back in math.  Garry  and I got the same grade for, like, the THIRD time... we got 94.  Spooky  (James) got a 92 and  Davia  got a 91.  3)  Antwon  has decided that my new nickname is " John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt ", after that dumb song he was singing in Social Studies class... in retaliation, I have now begun calling him " Tickle-Me Antwon "...   4)  Brandi  e-mailed me.  5) I thought about changing " SmookieLand " to " Smookie Ville  ", " Smookie Town  ", or " The City Formerly Known as Smookie "...  6)  Shaun  decided that he no longer wants to be affiliated with  Alejandro  or  Garry  because they smacked him upsdie his head a couple of times... fortunately, he is still friends with me, though Alejandro and Garry are begging for forgiveness (he has two of their GameCube games, hahaha, but I don't lend stuff to Shaun, so I'm good...)     SHOUT OUTS    1)  Brandi  cuz she's ALWAYS looking out for me and talking to me and updating her stories for me.... YaY!!!  2)  My Dad  for coming home today.... finally...     Okay, that's all for today... see ya next time, folks...   -SmOokie
