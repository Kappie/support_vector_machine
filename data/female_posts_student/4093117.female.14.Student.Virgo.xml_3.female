We need to make $1,500 in order to put out the first issue and we need the money by Friday. But never the less, that makes 3 sold by me, and maybe 5 tomorow. I still have to check out Bailey's in the morning and the Gulf Coast Park 'N Sell place around 9 a.m.  And  tonight I'm going to try and sell an ad at Copperfield Books. Plus Muzzie's will most likely buy one on Saturday. Well maybe not "most likely" but there's a good chance. And I already know of certain places that will buy at certain times. Oh wait, I'm also going to Show Stoppers tomorow. The lady there seemed really interested in buying an ad. She was nice. Who knows, maybe the psychic down the street will want to buy one, too. That would be awesome. Oh, another thing that happened today- my other Olympics article was too long and Nicole decided that she wants me to write a new article with a totally new angle. Fortunately my information was so good in the other article that she's still going to try and use it by putting text boxes in the newspaper. So all my hard work didn't completely go to waste. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that yesterday I sold an ad to Combat Zone. Or did I put that in my last post? I must have because I didn't come home beefore I sold the ad. Hmm, I'm surprised I forgot. Oh well, that's me for you. Which reminds me, so that I don't forget, I should probably write all the stuff I have to do down in my planner. I love my planner. It's got all this neat handy dandy stuff in the back, like a map and a ruler. It's very nifty. Not to mention that I decorated the cover of it myself with duct tape, red tape, a Vans sticker, a horse picture, a photo from camp and a thing that says "Rule #385- Never pick nose past the knuckle." A life lesson well learned.
