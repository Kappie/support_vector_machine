I went to Grand China with my sister, mom and lil' miss Morgan (the  princess . She's at that stage where if she screams then she gets her way unless you prefer complete humiliation). Then I came home, took a nap, and had the strangest dream. I was in this water city or some place like a lake but it was very pretty water and the place had all these steps or gazebo type things in it. Some anonymous girl (and I) were following a guy through this water world type thing... make any sense to you? Interpret please. Anyway then I woke up and went back to church, totally made an idiot out of myself in front of a totally hott guy, then partied with the girls. Jessica and I went to Applebee's while Kol and Sarah went to a Sunday School meeting. Then we all met up for  ice cream  * could I get a sample of that, from..... that guy right there?* and shopped out of the back of Sarahs pimp car. hehe. That was it! I'm sooooo disappointed that I have to work tomorrow, but  Chad  comes back tomorrow too... so that makes it better :) Good nite, muaaaah!
