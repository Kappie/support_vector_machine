I'm done the ridiculous 6 exams and even the SAT II I had to wake up at 7AM for this morning is completely, utterly, undeniably, 100% OVER!  O, I'm back! Long time no see to blogger.com. The new format is, uh, well it's weird. I'll get used to it. I like that people can comment... you all better leave me lots!  I just got amaaazing news! Ray's going to Fordham next year so he and Quiara are living in Manhattan! Whooooo!*excited but dorky and very loud scream*. I will be there CONSTANTLY! Yeah, I go to New York by myself now. So basically I'm only THE coolest person, uh, ever? I think Mary, Caroline, Annie and I are going to go see Wicked next week... gotta catch Kristen before she's gone forever!  Also!!!!!!!!!! I drive now! (Just so you don't steer completely clear of all roads in fear of me, you should know that by "drive" I mean down my little dead end street AND turn into my driveway. So if you live on Tinkherhill Lane, be very afraid, but if not, you're safe... for the next 4 months at least.)
