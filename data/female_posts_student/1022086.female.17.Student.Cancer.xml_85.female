I technically no longer have to attend Chemistry class, as today we turned in a lab as our final. I might sleep in Thursday, but tomorrow I'll work on Calculus bonus during Chem class... Yeah...   Calculus is almost over, and that's a yay. I hope the exam won't be too bad... the last thing I need is a grade dragger-downer.   Coach Morris is being totally unfair in his grading in US History, and though we tried to appeal and stand up for our rights, he wouldn't listen nor quiver. Bah. I just sincerely hope that his stupid class doesn't drag my GPA down to ashes!  Choir's all over and vacant. No more Kim... *sniffle sniffle*  Today Kim and I had our cafe smoothie that was planned a few months ago, our last junior-senior get-together. It was rather fun. We meandered about consuming massive amounts of caffeine, smoothiness, and super energizing stuff and jammed out to a music sampler at Target. An action that none other than we, the Waiter Thugs, would complete, indeed. (Peace,   By the by by, we have a fish now. It's a fighter fish dude, and it's blue. I named it Giotto (after the artist). Of course, I didn't ask for a fish, but apparently it's my fish now, as I obviously got stuck having to take care of it. I feel really bad for him because he's stuck in that stupid tiny tank. I am very much against the trapping of fish in fish tanks. Although I'm not sure the lives of fish are much fun anyway, I bet that being stuck in a little glass bowl with, perhaps, a little plastic castle must be infinitely obnoxious.  Shah and Asia are super fighting these days, and I can't stand either one of them. Although I generally love cats, I'm not sure I'll have any as an adult when I move into my own place.   School has gotten unbelievably pointless. I really, truly, and honestly cannot wait for it to be over.   Miss Katherine thinks I should date around, and I might actually give the idea a momentary shot. She evidently has a list of set-ups, and I figure that I'm young, at an age where most normal people date, and I'm not sure I have much to lose by trying it. Besides, I might be bored for a week or two!   Well, maybe I should go to bed and shower, or, rather, shower and go to bed, since I should get up for school tomorrow, even if it is a bit pointless... Oh, I almost forgot!! Today Mrs. Smith gave us super-packets of stuff for making it through AP Chemistry, and it was really exciting. The folder contained: -3 sheets of freshman rocket paper -1 sheet of goldenrod -1 sheet of equilibrium shift paper -1/8 of a sheet of ashless filter paper -1 scratch and sniff sticker -1 certificate for completing the ChemOlympiad competition in March -1 mole dollar -1 periodic table of the elements with pictures of each (yay! Now I have TWO periodic charts to go on my wall!!!) -1 bumper sticker-- mine was particularly awesome because it looked cool and said the coolest thing: "I'm undersaturated-- I can take more!!!"  I   Well, I should go to bed at some point.
