We promised today that niether one of us would drink anymore!! So I am happy about that. I have had a shitty day ever since I got off the phone with my mom. I found out today she may have cancer. *cries* I CAN'T LOSE HER SHE IS THE ONLY FAMILY I HAVE.  I kow don't know what I will do if I lose her!! If I lsoe her there is no reason for me to live anymore, but Shanna and our non-existening children, but the way we ahve been fighting latley and me causing her stress and confusion she may not want me for too much longer. It kills me you know I may be losing my mom and all I can think about is how unfair it would be for her to die and not see my graduate. Do u think I could anymore selfish?? Shanna and I told our problems out, but the fact she says I cause stress and confusion in her life still borthers me alot and hurts. I am sorry I keep jumping form one thing to the next but this is how my thought process works. I am worried sick about my mother. I won't know for sure if she has cancer until wed. which sucks because I am spoiled and I want to know right now!!! All I kee thinking about is how much of a bitch I have been to her grwoing up and I don't understand how she could still love me after all the shit I have said and done to her*cries* I am sorry mom I really am I never wanted to hurt you. Shanna I jsut want to hide in the comfort of your arms and Iw ant you to tell me I am not going to lose my mom. I need someone to old me right now.I feel like I am cry until I die or I am going to hurt myself real bad!! I juat want to be with my mom and have shanna beside me. I am try to be strong for Shanna but right now I just want to be the weak one and have her hold me while I cry. I CAN"T LOSE MY MOM I CAN"T
