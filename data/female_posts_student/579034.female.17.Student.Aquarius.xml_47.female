But tomrrow we leave for Brown and I don't know I'm looking forward to it and then I'm not.. ya know? I don't want it to be like last year when we all just wanted to kill each other. I want to have fun this year guys!! We must have fun!!! So... yea.. I'm talking to Mick and I'm really depressing myself. I had a hard time today at PSAT class and... like.. I started to cry towards the end of the class cause I just DID NOT get the math. I hate it.. and it hates me. I'm not gonna get into Notre Dame you guys. I'm just not. I'm gonna try of course, but... I know what their answer will be already. I just wish I was good at something. Like, track, I'm okay at... not really good. I wanna be really good at something. I wanna be able to be like "BAM look at what I'm good at!" I wanna go to Notre Dame. That's the reason I do all the stupid clubs I do. I want it so bad, and even though people say "If you want it bad enough you'll get it." this does not apply here. It doesn't. I want Notre Dame so bad, I would give up just about anything for the chance to go there... but... enough of this pointless crying and worrying. I'll just need to get myself together by Tuesday when I take the PSAT's. Chances of getting a 900... slim to none. I'll report on Brown Saturday night. Much love. x0x
