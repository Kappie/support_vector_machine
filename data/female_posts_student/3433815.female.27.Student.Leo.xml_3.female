I love Goren (I think his named is spelled that way) he is just so wacky and intelligent (I know there is no such man like that but, he would be my dream man!)awwww..(know anyone?? hee hee) So, I am now taking Trimspa (from Walmart) and I LOVE the energy, it feels like I am the energizer bunny rabbit!!! I did all my homework (online stuff)within 6 hours (it was alot of stuff too!) normally I would have done it last min and complained, but I have the power or trimspa!! I will lose the fat! I wanna go to the zoo, who wants to go with me? ok, well I write more later gotta take a shower before I go out! being sinky is only fun when your alone.
