We went to eat and I had an amazing steak and grilled chicken breast dinner. Mmmm. plus a salad. plus a cup of chili..and plus a giant friend taco shell apple dessert mmmm!. I ate for two hours straight! It was soo awesome! I love to eat food! *I don't really know how I ate for two hours though.  Let's see what else did we do...went to hobby lobby so I can get to work on some awesome graduation and mother's day presents and bought a few feeder goldfish..only wanted two but the clerk made me buy ten. I figured that paying a dollarto buy a few fish to watch to help reduce stress was well worth it.  I've decided to call them   The Ten Elvises  . Have A Great Day After Valentine's Day Too! And I'll keep rocking it single. Whuhoo.
