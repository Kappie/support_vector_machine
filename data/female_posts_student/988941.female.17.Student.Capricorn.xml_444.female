OHyeah I can, I was revising with mother, which was actually helpful. Today I got up about 9.30, ate a leisurley breakfast (cos everyone was alrady up and in the garden), oitered around my room listening to music and chilling, and finally got dresed aboyut 11am. I then did 2 hours on maths before lunch. After lumnch I lay in the hammock in the sun for an hour, then I got attacked by Nancy cos apparently I was a pirate and I might attack the ship she was sailing round the garden. So I grabbed a plastic sword and started fighting back, and it ended with her walking the plank. I then took over the sh ip, but got bored after a while a decided to jump up and down on the exercie trampoline. Then my legs got wobbly so I gave up, went back inside and did some more music appreciation, ha ha. Then I went out for a biyccycle ride with my down all across these fields and stuff, and I can tell you, boy does my back-side hurt. But anyway! I'm going to do some history revision later, and I'm going to do some more science with mother tonight. Toodles pip for now guys (seeings as MSN isn't working), and see you all tomorrow!
