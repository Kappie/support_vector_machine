IT'S BURNING!!! lol..i was like..WHAT THE HELL/. lol...great..now my eye is like full of dirty water. lol, it didn't effect me that much, i ran to the bathroom to wipe my eye up..ewewew...ok, then after i was like..i should pack something to eat at school, cuz obviously i am a human being and i need to eat, and i get hungry..well guess what?? THERE WAS NO BREAD AND NO BAGELS! what is going on here?!?! lol. so i get angry..and thought, i'll just eat breakfast, and not pack anything..so i grab a bowl..and take some cereal..as i was pouring the cereal..IT DROPPED ALL OVER THE FLOOR!! well like..it kinda bounced out of my bowl onto the floor..since when does cereal BOUNCE?! well today..it did..so i finally ate my cereal and went to school (all this happened in less than 30min) crazy..so i go to school..and we had..hmmmm. 2 FIRE ALARMS..what is with this school and fire alarms!? and one of them was right in the middle of a quiz..and the other ..right b4 i suppposed to do my test...so the test got cancelleld..cuz we would've had to write it in like and hour..which is UNLIKELY..and all through the day..i was happy cuz i couldn't wait till the end of the day where i go home..and at 4 or so my baby will come over and see me..hmmm..when i got home tho..i realized..my brother wasn't home.."where's stanley, mom?" *jO reads a note dad left for mom* "what's this?? it says..something..uh.." *it was in chinese. lol* "umm..it says, me and stanley went to peterbrough something for..carsen?"
