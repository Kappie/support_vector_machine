They made me take off my hat too :( We walked to UA to see the terminal but it was sold out and the next show was too late so we decided on Troy. Danny left, me and Katie got Chinese food and went back to UA to wait a couple of hours. Niko George Joanie and Chris showed up and Cassandra a little later. Danny came back, we played hacky sack and saw Troy. If you havent seen Troy, go see it. It's an amazing movie. I can't find one bad thing to say about it. Drove Katie home, and now I'm going to watch the last couple of minutes of Edward Scissor Hands. July 4th tommorow... Good reason to celebrate... :-D
