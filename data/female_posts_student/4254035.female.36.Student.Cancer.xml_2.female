Thomas Merton  As the quote adaptly states, no matter how much we think we know . . . we're gonna fall on our ass anyway.  No offence to Norman Vincent Peale or anyone of that genre but sometimes we have to be real, no matter how much we wish we could pretend.  And Kenny, if I end up w/ no friends or family by the end of this excersize . . . IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. (just sos ya know . . . ;)
