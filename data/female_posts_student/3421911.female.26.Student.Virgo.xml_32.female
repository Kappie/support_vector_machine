She could barely figure out what made her body ache the way it did as she glanced at the time.  	“Ohmigod!  It’s already 8:00 am!!!  Cynthia! Cynthia!”  No reply.  Nowhere to be found was the man she spent the night with.  He left a note though, “thank you, whoever you are.”  She couldn’t remember his name either:  Roy, Eric, Randy, whatever.  She reached for a pack of cigarettes – empty.  She would only have scotch today.  Her cat’s meow reminded her that she was alone, and that her younger sister was on a symposium.  Chelsea wouldn’t be back until Saturday.  She pours wine on her glass again and looks at the picture of Ronald, her greatest love.  They were supposed to get married when he met an accident on the ever of their wedding day.  When they recovered Ronald’s body, they found out that he had been drinking.  What hurt Celina more was that her best friend Sophia died with Ronald.  Only then did she know about their affair and that Ronald was breaking up with Sophia that night.  	Their mother thought it best for Chelsea to stay with Celina to help her recover.  Celina didn’t have any serious relationships afterwards, but she had lots of flings. Most of them she’d met at a bar or at a disco and they would proceed to her place, just like the guy who left.  Celina made love to them even though they hardly knew each other.  	She glanced at Ronald’s picture again.  “This is all your fault.”  She cries as she gulps the remaining contents of her glass.  *** 	“Good morning, Gina.”  Celina greeted her secretary.  She knew that a ton of papers was waiting for her to sign as she walked into her office.  Lighting a cigarette, she began to work.  She had been so engrossed that she did not notice a co-worker and college friend enter the room.  	“I thought you were gonna kick the habit goodbye,” he said.  	“Oh, it’s you.  I didn’t know I was being watched.  Well, it kinda gets me relaxed.  How long have you been there?”  	“Enough to know that it’s your fourth stick.  Hey, listen, it you don’t have any plans, why don’t we do lunch?” his eyes beaming in anticipation.  	“Oh, not today, Andrew.  I came in late already so I might just stay here and skip lunch.  Maybe some other time.  Thanks anyway.”  	“Well, okay then, don’t want to keep you from your job.  I’ll see you.”  And then he walked out of her office.  She’s still tough, he thought.  	He had liked her ever since college but it was only after Ronald’s death that he had mustered the courage to ask her out.  It hurt him to see her self-destruct and he wanted to be the one to fill the void in her life.  She was everything he had wanted in a woman:  beautiful, intelligent, kind.  But she could only see him as a friend.  Great.   She’d go out with almost every guy she meets. Why won’t she go out with me?  *** 	Chelsea didn’t want to leave her sister in such an imbalanced state, but her boss required her to represent their company in the week-long symposium in Laguna.    	Ronald and Sophia’s death was a big blow to Celina.  It transformed her into a loose woman.  Chelsea had been telling Celina to quit smoking but she wouldn’t listen.  Now she’s been drinking wine for breakfast.  She wonders how her sister can still manage a firm with the kind of life she leads.  Worst of all, it had been her sister’s habit to bring home a guy she met somewhere in the middle of the night doing God-knows-what.  Her sister was slowly becoming a whore.  The only difference was that it seemed like she was the one paying for their services.  Chelsea tried to convince herself that her sister was just going through a phase, that it was just her way of coping with the loss of her boyfriend and her best friend.  	 I wonder how she’s holding up , she thought.   She can’t just sleep with any guy she meets . . .   	“The project will commence on the second day of March, 2001 . . .” the words of the speaker just went right through her, she was barely listening.  	 What if she gets STD?  Or worse, AIDS?  What if she comes across a maniac or something?  What if –   	“Is the discussion boring you, Miss Perez?” Miss Perez?”  	“Oh, what?  Oh, no, I’m sorry.  I’m very sorry.”  She blushed in embarrassment.  *** 	The woman could hardly move.  At first, she was very enthusiastic with this particular session for her new client had drop-dead good looks enough to make her mouth water.  More so, she was getting paid to enjoy herself.  But now, she thanked God it was finally over.  She couldn’t believe what hit her, literally.  She slowly crawled out of bed and reached for the dresser.  A thousand bucks.  A thousand bucks wasn’t enough to repair her face and heal the excruciating pain she felt.  She had been horrible sodomized by what looked like a perfectly normal human being searching for fun.    	“I’ve been ripped off!!!”  *** 	Walking out of the motel room was a very satisfied man, smiling and smoking.  His name is jay, real estate broker by day, madman by night.  This was not the first time he had abused someone sexually, not would it be the last.  He enjoyed the idea of women and gays swooning over him and the sound of their screams after he is through with them.  He is motivated by anger that is never ending and he will not stop until he has had his fill.  *** 	Five-thirty pm.  It’s a Friday.  Everyone is rushing out of the office, except Celina.   They must not know which bar I’m going to.  I can’t risk my reputation.   	Ever since Ronald died she has not found anyone who could fill the void he left.  She couldn’t even tell the difference between love and lust now.  Chelsea asked her to stop the pattern she developed with guys, but now, she just can’t.  I’ll hurt them the same way they hurt me, she said to herself.  But who could she hurt now, if Ronald and Sophia are both dead?  ***  	 A lot of matrons will come her, women with no dates, gays looking for pleasure, that wouldn’t be so bad , Jay thought.  He is on the lookout for his next victim.  Suddenly, a beautiful woman walked inside the bar, alone.  She stroked her hair so gracefully and slowly made her entrance.  Divine, he thought.  The woman sat right beside him and asked for a drink.  	“Cosmo, please.”  She must have sensed the pair of eyes staring at her so she smiled.  Greg started to make his move.  	“Why is it that beautiful women end up being alone on nights like these?” he asked.  	“I don’t know, a curse, maybe.  And you, what’s your excuse?”  	“Well, I don’t consider it a curse.  For one, it’s actually a good opportunity to meet lovely people like you.  I’m Greg Panganiban, and you are?”  	“Celina Perez.  Are you always this cocky?”  	“Not really.  But if I weren’t some other guy would’ve been here giving you an even lamer line….”  And they both laughed.  	“Seriously now, why are you alone?”  Greg was so fascinated with this woman.  He swears never to hurt her if he had the chance.  	“Some stupid guy dumped me for someone else.” She replied.  	“Well, I couldn’t be caught committing that mistake.  Why don’t we go somewhere so we could talk?  It’s pretty noisy in here.”  She easily gave in to the request.”  	“Sure.  We can go to my place.”  ***  	Celina had had been so astounded by the way this man carried himself around her.  He had been so gentle with the way he held her hand as they walked out of the bar and escorted her to her car.  A real gentleman.  Little did she know she was in for the time of her life.  Or what could possibly end it.  *** 	 	Greg promised himself that he would behave for he could not bear to lose this woman with whom he had been badly smitten.  He kissed her gently and she followed his every motion.  Everything was going fine when suddenly, a red film flashed before his eyes and he could hear a voice beckoning him to hurt her.   Hit her, Greg.  Hit   her hard.    After that, he could not tell what was happening anymore.  He could only hear the screams of a woman fighting back.    	“Oh, please, stop.  You’re hurting me . . . you’re hurting me . . .” He was pounding on something over and over.   That’s it, that’s good.  Show them who’s the man.   The feeling elated Greg.    The red film cleared and he saw a woman terribly bruised and blue.  Blood was all over the room. Horrified, he walked out of the house.  	Celina could not believe what was happening to her.  He had hit her so many times, she could not fight back. She was too weak.  She screamed for help but her cries fell on deaf ears.    	“Help!  Stop, please.  Stop it!  stop please!  Stop . . ………stop…………”  And then everything was black.  ***  	Saturday morning.  Cynthia dropped by the grocery before heading home.   I hope everything’s alright.  She really missed her sister.  She admitted how Celina could be a real pain in the ass but deep inside she was a very remarkable person.  She hurriedly took the key out of her bag but was surprised to see that the door was open.  Something was jamming the door.  She pushed some more and she was finally able to go in.    	“Ohmigod, Chloe!”  The cat was lying there, all bloodied.  “Celina!  Celina!!”  She rushed to her sister’s room, her heart throbbing, her hands trembling.  “NNNNOOOO!!!!!”     N. B.  This was originally written in 1997, to be submitted to the author’s editors then.  It’s pretty obvious why the work was rejected.  This was written at the time when the author had no idea what a bar looks like, how it feels like to be picked up, sodomized or beaten up to death.  Now, the author has been to a number of bars, her favorites being Gweilo’s and Mayric’s (most bars that she’s been to have now closed:  Phenomena, Kampo, and Hobbit Hideaway has a new owner).  Thankfully, she has not yet been picked up to be sodomized or beaten up to death :)
