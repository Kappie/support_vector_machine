Ugh! I'm sick again. And really, the only reason I'm mentioning it (aside from an obvious ploy for sympathy) is so that I've got it written down somewhere because I have been getting sick   soooo   often lately, it's not even funny... Mostly I'm trying to see if there's a pattern of some sort. So, yeah, feel free to pass right on by this...
