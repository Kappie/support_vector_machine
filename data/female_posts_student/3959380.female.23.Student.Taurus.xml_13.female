Good old fashioned sandwich at Stinky Cheese was going to be followed by a cake at  urlLink Brunetti .  But on the way across Lygon we got talking about hot chocolates and I suggested we go to Max Brenner, since I actually knew where it was now cause Mum and I walked passed it yesterday on our labrynth trip to QV.   Anyway , we had to wait to order, we had to wait for a table and we had to wait  ages  for our food.  Which wasn't that good, mainly because it was cold by the time we got it.  The only good bit in the melty centre of the souffle was the hard white chocolate bit and the best thing about the hot chocolate was the fabulous ergonomic design of the "hug" cup.  The orientally design and the chocolate coloured wood around the place was pretty lush, but I don't think I'll be heading back for a while... especially on a weekend or a public holiday.  Not because it was busy, although it was, but because they charged a  10% surcharge  which is absolutely ridiculous.  Should have gone to Brunetti and put up with the burnt coffee!
