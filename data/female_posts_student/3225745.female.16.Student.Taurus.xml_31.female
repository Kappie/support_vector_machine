I understand most of you are republican but if you could give this guy a chance, he is a good man. Go visit his website  urlLink www.meyer04.us  or  urlLink www.blog.meyer04.us . Just check it out. If you want to have a good man representing you, then you will stand behind morris.    Anyway, Hope you can make the right choice. I know we cant vote now, but it isnt about now, it is about the future. If we keep thinking just about the moment people like Joe Barton get away with ruining the world for future generations. We cant just think about ourselves, we need to think about other people.   Thank you for listening jenny
