I went to Kohl's with Chelsea.  We each got a new suit and decided to do a duo next year.  So my new suit is kick ass, but you will have to wait to see it.  Then I went out for Starbucks with Ferrell and some other peoples you guys wouldn't know from BA.  That was...interesting.  Then I had Interp Theater practice.  I am tired out.  I have practice tomorrow and I'm babysitting on Saturday so I'm going to see Cinderella on Sunday with a few people.  It'll be awesome.  Sarah and Elisa will steal the show.  I've been to some rehersals and they are unbelievably good.  Sarah has to be the most talented person I have ever met.  Rachel and I were talking about how she inspired us to do well in Forensics.  She is amazing and I guarentee she will become famous someday.  I have a jam packed schedule for the next three weeks.  It's nice to have things to do.  I hate sitting and just have nothing going on in my life.  That would be an incredibly sad life.  Yeah *sigh*.  Oh I do have good news.  The guy I used to like, I don't like him like him anymore.  Our friendship has bloomed and I don't want anything to change.  It's a really nice feeling.  To know that my crush is gone simply because something more has developed...hint of smile.  Sorry Becca, I definitely stole your "beautiful people" line.  Oopsie Daisy.  Ha when was the last time I said that............yesterday *bashfully*.  Okay I can't hold it in.  My new suit is a lilac purplish color.  It kicks hiney (butt).  I'm so excited.  I'm wearing it to districts.  I hope it doesn't piss Medlin off.    Oh well.  Districts will be fun. Well,  I have to go wash my hair *notice the typical dating excuse, meaning I have better things to do*.
