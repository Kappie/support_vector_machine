I'm a pansy, I know, but everyone knows that :-) . yeah so tomorrow I'm grandma-sitting, it's like baby-sitting but only I'm watching a grandma instead of babies. These people who live across the street from us need me to stay with Eleanor (the Grandma) and I really don't want to do it, but these people do so much for our family, so there is no way could have said no...well that and my mother is making me. But it's all good, I was told she sleeps all day so I'll just bring a book and read. Okay so yay for ashley! My birthday is in two weeks and we're gunna have a huge-ass party, and and we're gunna decorate my backyard, and have food, and lots and lots of people ( I think the count is only 30 people so far), and it'll be great fun and I'm excited. I love turning 16. I get my tattoo, and my car keys, and my license, and my new cell phone, and lotsa money! I'm so excited!!! Oh and by the way, I'm not materialistic I swear, lol. I'm excited, I want to have like this HUGE Cinderella Ball, but then people would have to go rent tuxes and buy dresses, and I'm not sure everyone would be able to afford that. But yeah, I gotta go so I can make my invites cause I still haven't done that :-/...
