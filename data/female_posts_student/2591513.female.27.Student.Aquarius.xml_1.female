We had to trap him in the kitchen because he is scared of the laundry room...mom put him in there while the dryer was running.  I would be scared too.  Ed spent the evening chasing him around to use the potty on his training sheet.  LOL  Yeah that was fun.  A couple of accidents,  but in the end, he did use it on the sheet.  Now how we are going to keep that up with Ed gone...that will be interesting.  I have had a lot on my mind.  A lot of things I talk about here.  A lot of things I don't.  The things I don't talk about are the things I can't deal with right now.  So I shove it behind.  The bad thing is it builds up.  My birthday is in less than 2 weeks.  Wow, already?  Where did the time go?  Too bad you can ask people to pay your bills...haha...that would be a GREAT GIFT....just kidding...well maybe not...haha  I feel like I am always trying to catch up to something I cannot catch up to.  I don't know.  i can't really explain it...oh to be in my mind, huh?
