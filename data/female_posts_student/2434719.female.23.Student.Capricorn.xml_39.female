BUSH, THEY'RE RIGHT HERE...  well, my last name may be connor.... but damn that was alot of guinness. last night was car bomb night with dha and jmo. it was a pre-celebration of danny's birthday becuase i am not going to be able to make it to next weekend's festivities.  i baked a cake for danny, and jason (aka gene wilder) was bartender, pouring the car bombs and the atomic bus bombs (or as i call them, WMD's... nobody else thought that was funny, but i know it is).... we all got so drunk... my goodness (my guinness).   do you guys remember danny's birthday??  i always chuckle when i think of it... SIX MORE HONKS TO GO TO AUSTRALIA. when it's midnight and you have about 20 aggies together who have been drinking since 11am at tables set up on the busiest street of college station... you get a bunch of screaming kids hoping to go down under. now that's what i call a surprise party.     EVEN ERKEL KNOWS, FAMILY MATTERS  the night before last i went to hillsboro, tx, to hang out with kristin and her sisters, samantha and amanda. great girls!  i loved seeing the three of them together... i could see pieces of kristin in them.    NICE GIRLS WHAT?  i remembred something kristin used to say to me when we were kids... when i was at her house and thirsty... i'd say, "kristin, i'm thirsty." and she'd say, "swallow your spit." !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   IT'S A TOSS UP BETWEEN WARWICK AND CLEO  oh my word. my horoscope today. i don't even know what to say it was scary. well, shit, we'll see what happens.  :)   FINDING MY SPIRIT  so i finished my big paper. now it's time for the big project. here's the best party...... IT'S ON OPRAH. yes, you heard it right. i love being in journalism. words can't describe.... well as a journalist i should be able to do that... ah well. p.s. unt is one of hte top ten journalism schools in the U.S. go mean green!
