Together with WanPIn, Amy and Peiyu...... cause i have 4 tickets mahz then my father ask mi whether got friends wanted to go so i asked them along lohz ..... I left my house at around 4.15pm ... then meet wanpin and peiyu at my house dere de bus stop ... Amy lost her way and took cab to my house but then we went up the cab instead of alighting and then we make our way to the National Stadium .....    Reached dere and then there were so many ppl, we make our way up and then took the fun pack and went in the stadium..... we sat quite high on top, second last row ... Not long after the pre-parade started ..... Kinda sianz in the first place .... Crapping around and then the militery band started off .... so nice .... their formation was nice ....     Many performances went on but wad we were anxious and hoping is the fireworks .... as we were sitting at the back .... we were given an umbrella ... a nice transparent one ..... but after using we need to return back ... lolx ... when the fireworks started off at around 7.50pm .... we all were so high ... lolx ... we sang the national day songs and scream ..... lolx .... so happily and we really enjoy ourselves .... after that we took pictures....  (Thanks Kin Seng for lending me his camera)     At 8.10pm the parade was about to end .... Singing our national anthem and taking the national pledge, it seem so different when taking it in school ... We sang and say our pledge proudly ... then we waited awhile before heading out of the stadium.... outside was full of ppl ... damn crowded .. but lucky we managed to find our way out ..    Dunno where to walk ... but at last walked to a bus stop and we just boarded the bus without knowing where the bus would be going ... but that was a big mistake .... cause inside the bus wad damn smelly ... Oh Gosh! Really cannot take it sia ... and alight at somewhere near suntec city .... then took cab down to 'Lau Pa Sar' to have our dinner ...    Went to eat 'zhu chao' .... the dishes we order have stingray, oystersauce veg and sotong ... Other than this we also ordered satay.... So full after eating ..... and walked out .... waiting of cab again to make our way home as it is quite late.... I alight first then should be amy, then wanpin and lastly peiyu ....    I was damn tired after that ... took a bath and then online to check my mail .... at around 12.30 to 12.45am .. i went to sleep ... that is how i spend my day ....     I am very happy to be at the NDP Parade(Preview).... And also not forgetting, Proud to be a SINGAPOREAN .....Happy 39th Birthday Singapore ...
