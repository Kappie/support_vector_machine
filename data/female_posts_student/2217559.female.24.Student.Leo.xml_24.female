It was fun although I must say I never knew he had such INTERESTING friends.  Mostly his brother's friends, I think.  His brother is 19 and boy what an age difference that is. I felt old last night. 24. Bah hum bug. I found my self remenising over high school days, friends and parties. =  Didn't make it to church this morning. I just felt like sleeping in and I think Jennifer is throwing a bar b que at her house this afternoon to watch some football game with friends. I have toget ready for my webcam interview tomorrow! Ohh - wonder what I will wear??!?! I am sure i will find something. I was going to put the hawaiian background up behind me but I didn't find time to actually go purchase one this weekend. Guess I will find something out.
