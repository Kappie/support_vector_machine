All day at work, Megan was askin what was wrong with me...there wasn't anything wrong exactly, my mind has just been constantly thinking about SO many different things, and I have a HUGE headache that I have had since what? Tuesday?  I don't know what I thought about really at any given moment today, there really are a lot of things that I could think about right now.  One thing, my older sister just got her own place (well, she's movin in with her boyfriend, but it's still HER place :)).  Tonight I got home from work, and it was about 11:00 so I was suprised there was nobody home...then I came inside and ALL of Angel's stuff is GONE! GONE! It's so freakin weird to step inside her room and talk cuz how much it echoes and her closet is empty, EVERYTHING that is hers....the stuff in the bathroom even is GONE.  It really makes me realize how quickly time is goin by and how that is my next step, now that college is gettin ready to start and all.  It just was a really big reality check for me tonight when I saw the emptiness that used to be filled with memories of her.    Oh, today was a really good day at work...I know this seems to switch topic, but I gotta say tonight was one of the nights that I love the MOST in my life....me and megan stayed after work until about 10:50 just talkin on top of my car.  We talked about so many things that need to be talked about that are goin on in each other's lives, what has went on in the past, and just stuff about close friends that annoy each of us...and we got to talk to the sweet man Eddie that lives in the appartments behind the theater.  Oh my god, this man is so cute.  He's probably about 45-50 years old and he's kinda slow in the head, but he has a great memory, he remembers our names...even mine! He remembers what we look like and everything, he's so cute tho.  I think what I like about him most is how he reminds me of everything that is still good and innocent in the world.  It's so nice to meet somebody like that after you realize how people are totally different than what you had once thought and once you just totally lose faith in some people, it's just so good to talk to a guy like Eddie and realize not to just hate and not trust the whole world cuz there is still some things out there that should be cherished and trusted.    Another thing cool about work today was talking to Chamonix.  It was kinda weird at first, because I had always talked and made sure she didn't hear me talking about Nelson and his history with her. But we talked about him and how we both recently found out (well, me, recently, her, about 3 years ago...) but we talked about how psycho he is and some of the things that he said about both of us to people that he knows would get back to us that he said...it's so weird. I don't really wanna get into all that too much tho, the stuff to tell there is just well, kind of not interesting just readin :). lol.  Ok, there is one more thing that I have noticed lately.  I think that Ashley is kind of gettin a crush on Jacob.  I know that sounds really paranoid, but like everyday she tells me how he is REALLY COOL...and if she'd said this once it'd be cool but EVERY day she says this.  And there's other things that she kind of does.  I notice sometimes when I talk about how much I like him and the stuff that we do it gets kind of weird.  But me and Megan talked about the things she does that really gets on our nerves.  My main two:  1.  She adapts to doing the same things that each person does that is their thing that makes them unique and does them herself.  This one really ticks me off cuz those things are what make other people them, not ashley ashley...she just picks up on them and uses them herself.  I've said something about a couple of the things she does of mine and she just says "girl i been doin this a long time" and it's like yeah, as long as i've been doin it. dumbass.  2.  She molds to be the person that everybody else would want her to be.  Not even always what they would want HER to be...but to be a person like the one that they would like.  Megan put it really good I think when she used these examples : with Neil, Ashley acted like she drinks all the time, and with RL, she acted like she is all kinds of sex-craved and masturbates all the time.  It's so annoying that she does that.    But I was thinking, and I don't think that anything is gonna happen with her and Jacob, but it's just that if it did it would make me so mad just because he wouldn't have done it for the actually ashley, it would have been with this person that he had a false vision of.  So if he did think he liked her, when he found out he just liked that false vision that was the front that she put up, it would be too late to fix anything.  But I really feel bad for any guy that actually really likes her.  I feel like I need to tell them to look past what she's showing them, look past it and see the real Ashley.  She is never gonna get a guy to hold interest if she doesn't let them get interested in the real her.  But imagine the poor guy that just believes that what she shows is the real her...and he falls for her just to realize that it wasn't her at all that he fell for.  That's gotta destroy somebody something bad.    I think I need to stop talkin bad about my friend...but there's one last thing I MUST mention when talkin about Ashley...she is the most damn selfish person I know.  She never likes to talk about anything unless it involves her or impacts her in some way.  Like you'll be talkin to her and then as soon as she realizes you aren't talkin about her, she'll go "uh huh...let me tell you what happened to me today" or "yesterday, or there was this guy that asked for my phone number.." or of course, the oh-so-famous "the guy takin the money at mcdonalds looked at me when he was takin my order...he liked me".  It is so annoying.  And when you talk to her online, you ask her questions and she doesn't answer them, just totally overlooks them to tell you about something goin on in her life or something that RL or Justin said to her.  You have to ask her like 5 times..did u answer my question? Answer my question! before she finally answers.    OK, so really, enough about Ashley! :) I really do love her, but there are just so many things that she does that just makes you not trust her in a way, I feel really bad sayin it, but it's so true.  I hate leavin on this note, makes me seem like such a bitch and like a bad friend, but again, this entry is turning into a book!
