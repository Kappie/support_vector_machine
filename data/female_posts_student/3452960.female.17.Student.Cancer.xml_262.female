Yay stopping biting nails! Also, I found out last night that Bri didn't think we could do the tour. She said she couldn't see it happening. We'll show her. Grrr. I give you all permission to do horrible things to me if we don't.   Me and Penmo, having been forsaken by everyone else, stood around in the rain planning last night. We have decided that the VW must be called something. So far, we have thought of Alice, Georgina, and Daisy. If anyone else has any ideas, please put them in a comment. (not you tony, gatevaulters and Matt and possibly Olly only)
