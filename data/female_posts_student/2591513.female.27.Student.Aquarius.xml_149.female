Poor guy tomorrow he has to change the oil in three cars, our van, our civic and then my sister's eclipse...she has been kind enought o let us us while she is on break.  Thanks Leila...we are so saving in gas and both Ed and Bailey are comfortable during their drive back home.  It is weird when both my sisters aren't home.  I am so used to having at least one of them here...adn by extension their significant others.  So when they aren't here, it seems odd...but it is also nice too.  The kids can be kids without me feeling like they are annoying people...at least they annoy me and Ed and well, we are their parents.  Anwyay so I was thinking today how horrible it feels when people don't return your phone calls.  I am going to try and return my phone calls.  I am so bad at that, but when you are on the other end, it sure as heck doesn't feel good.  So if I have ever forgotten to return a call.  I am so very sorry.  Bailey FINALLY has an appointment with the dermatologist tomorrow.  I am so glad, it has taken forever.  I hope they are going to be able to do something for him because I would hate for him to have a skin problem on top of his heart problem.  I don't want him growing up with a complex...but then again Bailey is a pretty level-headed kid.  Nalani was super cute today.  She went with me and Ed to get Bailey.  She loves when she can spend time with us, just her.  I don't blame her, it is hard to share parental attention.  Anyway, she so wants to go to Disneyland and I know it is going to take me forever to save the money I earn from my job, but I will try and save it to take the kids over to Disneyland.  Nalani has been dying to see the Snow White show there...since February...aww...poor Nalani.  Emily was funny today.  She is funny every day, but today we got to really watch it.  It was fun.  First I don't know what the hell she was doing to Ed's back, but it was funny....let's just say she was pulling a  Stitch or more recently, a Kawaii.  It was hilarious.  You had to be there.  Oh and then she kept making Nalani cry.  Funny how little children can press their older siblings buttons.  I know this because my sisters still to this day do that to me.  Well I will end my day's post.  A few thoughts...LAKERS vs PISTONS...it will be a very interesting in the Sticky Good Trip home.  We are trying to get back home before the game, so we have to elave the bay area around 8 or 9 in the morning.  All I have to say is All-Star team.  LOL  I love you Ed...but it is all about the LAKERS!
