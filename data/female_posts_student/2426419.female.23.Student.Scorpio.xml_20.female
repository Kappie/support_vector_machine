(the answer is "no" if anyone has any questions) thinking more specifically about our church. we are in the "jacob's well story" together, but does just participating in that story create community? i think what i am wondering about is what kinds of things would help us do life together even though we are spread out geographically (from edmond to norman to stillwater to moscow). i would love to hear everyone's thoughts about that angle of the community issue.  again, i think you are right about the common story, i just think for community there must be more.  j
