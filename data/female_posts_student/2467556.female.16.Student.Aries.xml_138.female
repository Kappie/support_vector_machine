We watched the movie, Love Actually, which was a really awesome movie.  There was one story in it though (because it was about 10 separate stories all connected by a single theme) about these people being stand-ins for a movie and they were naked for most of the movie....it was kinda gross.  Other than that, it was really cute.  Alan Rickman was in it too and he's the same guy who plays Professor Snape in the Harry Potter movies!!!  His character in Love Actually was a loving dad who kinda had an affair thing.....but i was laughing at it mostly because its hard to picture him any different from Snape especially when his character in Love Actually is the polar opposite from that of Harry Potter.  Colin Firth was sooooo adorable in that movie!!!  I got attached to him ever since i saw Bridget Jones' Diary.  Yeah so me and Brittnee caught up and it was cool.  I drove the Tracker there and back, it was exciting....besides the fact that i stalled 4 times on coppell road when i had to stop to wait for this person to turn on the way home....i was about to cry in that car.  And my dad's all like you need to practice more....but i'm kinda scared to tell the truth.  I don't want to stall anymore, its a scary feeling.    Today i just read some more/ate.  Nothing really exciting. I was supposed to go to this Birthday party for a family friend, but my parents told me that i was no longer required to attend about 30 mins ago. So now i'm sitting here, writing about my retarded life in this online journal thing.    ugh the tracker is frustrating.  but i still got to learn it.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
