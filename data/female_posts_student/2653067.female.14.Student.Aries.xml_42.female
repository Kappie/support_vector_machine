I was on msn, minding my own business when Kelsey and Rachael came on msn. They added me to a three way convo and we were all talking about songs and the wedge and stuff. Then, Kelsey (or perhaps it was Rachael) suggested that we all go to the thrift store the following day. We organized the plan and then all went offline.  Fri., July 16th- Kelsey came to pick me up at 1:30. We then went to Rachaels and watched a lot of tv. After a while, her mom pointed out that the thrift store closes at 3:00 so we peeled our asses off the couches and headed to the "store of thrift" (haha.. I love my spelling). Once we've finished browsing the store, I picked up asweet assedpair of earings for 25 cents, Rachael got a little old-style makeup thing and Kelsey bought a $2 red shirt. Jess (Who was also with us) bought nothing.From there, we bought some slurpees, went home, watched some tv and then we were faced with a difficult challenge; We must choose what type of pizza's we want for dinner. The jury finally came to a decision: Pepperoni and Veggetarian pizzas. I ate some of both. Twas good. Time passed. Many shows were watched. 8:00 Came so we (Kelsey, me, Rachael .. Jess went home) watched The Wedge. It was awsome. At about 3/4 of the way threw the wedge, we called Sam and told her to come over to celebrate her returning. The festival truly started when Sam got there. At one point (after the wedge) we were all dancing in Rachaels dark kitchen. Hah. That was an awsome "festival", We'll have to dothat again.   Stay tuned
