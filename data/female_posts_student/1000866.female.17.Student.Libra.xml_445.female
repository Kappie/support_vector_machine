I mean, it's really not a big deal to me. It's kind of just another day.   I don't think I'm going to Nikki's tonight. I'm just too tired. I don't know why I've been so tired lately. It's crazy. I think I may just go to sleep now. Yeah...that's definitely what I'm going to do. I mean, I guess I feel a bit like a loser for not going out and partying until all hours on Halloween but, 'eh.  Maybe next year.
