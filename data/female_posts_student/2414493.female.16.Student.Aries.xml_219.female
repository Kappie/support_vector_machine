It's stuck at the bottom of the fridge beneath all the other party food. Maybe later, I console myself.   Very tempted to practice the art of selective skipping, though it'd only be logical to skip periods 1 and 2 tomorrow. And I'd probably sleep in until 9 on a normal day anyways, not study. I need to do bio, and I didn't realize how much I should do for history until last night. Oops, I forgot to bring Princeton for Wendy. But I'm starting to read Barrons. It's actually pretty good.  I want to take a nap right now. Is that weird?  Keira got asked to prom yesterday, lol. It was cute. I just wonder what it's going to be like next year. We're going to have APs again, we're going to be suffering from senioritis, we're going to be scrambling for prom dates? Somehow that seems weird. But it's sweet. And a year away, so what the hell.  Starting a list: Things I want to do after APs: read Peace Like a River, or books in general go shopping with Jess go crazy  I didn't used to get so fatigued so easily. Guess I'm not in my prime anymore. Every day I come home, eat and then sleep sooner or later, at least before bedtime. It'll work. I'll make it work.
