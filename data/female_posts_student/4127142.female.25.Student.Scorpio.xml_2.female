I’m just fascinated by the Ghazal and I have to admit, it has left me  awestruck, just totally dazzled --  incensed !  What made me really understand the Ghazal was this website by  urlLink Andy Weaver , titled “The Bastard Ghazal.”  urlLink http://www.poetics.ca/poetics01/01weaver.html . Please visit this site! This man is amazing in describing ghazals! He created my breakthough in learning!       I will quote Weaver, (in just the parts of site that inspired me):     “The ghazal is an ancient Arabic style of poetry that dates from at least the 7th Century. It is written in couplet stanzas, each of which is self-contained.            No linear logic, can’t make sense of it!     People often compare the ghazal to the sonnet formally, since they’re both brief “takes” on a situation, usually love. However, the comparison is a pretty poor one, because of  that fundamental aspect of the ghazal: the lack of unity.  In other words, each couplet is not only self-contained grammatically; they are also self-contained in terms of ideas, imagery, allusions, etc. There can be no linear narrative or logic, no temporal progression, no contemplation of an incident in order to make sense of it. Instead, the first stanza exists on its own, perfect, complete, self-efficient, and is followed by a group of other perfect, complete, self-efficient stanzas….      Oranges and antelopes     “It is this lack of logical that usually draws readers and poets to the ghazal —  there’s nothing else really like it in English language poetry.  A sonnet is like a crown filled with precious jewels all set into an ornate, well wrought crown of beautiful gold. By comparison,  a ghazal would be those same jewels held together by an invisible string.  There’s really no comparison at all. Apples and oranges, the sonnets agree. Oranges and antelopes, the ghazals assent.”
