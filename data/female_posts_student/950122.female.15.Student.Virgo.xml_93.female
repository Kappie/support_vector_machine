So now I'm in an internet cafe.. *sigh* My brother is fixing it now, and he says it's awful. And I'm much pissed because everyone says it's my fault. My family has blamed me for putting the computer into a coma. But honestly, I haven't downloaded anything! >   I hope my brother can fix the computer without losing all my stuff.
