(God, that girl is funny!)  ii)   urlLink Tazz  gets confuddled when he gets into his car and hears "La Cucaracha".  iii)  There are more animals  outside  of the Bronx Zoo, than there actually are inside (Can I get a ringing of the inapropriate bell??)  Furthermore the Cocanya rat is a new breed that Anna and I have renamed, as its old nomenclature (the "Mouse-like Hamster") was just half assed.  iv)  I have a  H U G E  crush on someone who is a smartass and knows it 'cause he reads my blog, lol.  v)  More people need to  BUY   urlLink Digger Phelps ...they're good, you wont regret it!  **Management apologizes for the shittiness of this Friday Five, but well, this wasn't a really educational week.  My bad!**
