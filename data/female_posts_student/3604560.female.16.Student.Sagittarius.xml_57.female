I must've watched them about 6 times. Bout 6 hours long. Zheng, did you seriously read the book  4 times ? You are so brave... or bored... or insane... Still done  no  schoolwork/homework  at all . I am  so  gonna die. But die happy, as I haven't been doing work! :) Um... reading  Fire from Heaven  by Mary Renault. It's  so  good, but Haphaestion is  so sad ! He's so self-sacrificing and never gets what he wants. I think I'm gonna cry... Dad bought a book that has summaries of every classic book ever written:  Tess of the d'Urbervilles  in 15 pages! I prolly won't even read  that , but anywho. Too many books, I can't fit them on my shelf, let alone  read  them all! The agony! Congrats Zheng on the L's-getting. I would take a ride with you, but my parents would probably forbid me, especially after you told my dad about how you drove with the  handbrake on . Oh, well. I am tired, and my eye hurts, and my fingers are cold. Oh, yeah, I watched Spidey 2 yesterday! It was really good. I thought it would be crap, cos most sequels are... Main thing that bugged me was that Dr Ock seemed impervious to Spiderman's punches. He has mechanical arms, that  doesn't  make him superhuman! Anywho.  Nightie-night, sweethearts Don't miss me too much, I know it hurts, but we'll see each other again in *counts on fingers* seven days. bubye
