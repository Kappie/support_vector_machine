I would be on cloud nine if i could score 90 marks and above for this test...Cross my fingers....pray hard that it will come true....  Now,im really really exhausted...probably because i could not sleep last nite...Hahaz...because i was thinking abt Workshop thingie the whole nite through...now u can really see why im so stressed up esp. today.  Gonna hav a good sleep tonite...Yes! Finally....
