There is this one song on this CD that gets me depressed every time I put it in. It's Kyrie Eleision from Mass in E Minor by Anton Bruckner. So, so sad.  On Monday I started jobshadowing. It was pretty awesome. I loved Dermatology. Anesthesiology was alright, pretty gory though. And Human Resources was....well....not fun. Boring. Very boring. Tomorrow I do pharmacy! YAY!!!!!!!
