I'm starting to feel paranoid about stuff again...which isn't good. When I say stuff, I mean how people feel about me. I think that I've always been a little paranoid about what people thought of me and such, but I just get worried. For example, I worry that I'm, for lack of a better word, smothering Nick. He told me I'm not, but that doesn't mean that I don't worry about it anyways!!!!! grr.... Two more days til Persacon!!!!!! *ish excited* Anyways, I've still got a project to finish in Spanish, so I'll probly be up later than usual. It's almost 11:30!!!!! Well, I'm off. Got things to do. Love, Shannon "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date. No time to say "hello", goobye! I'm late I'm late I'm late!!!!"--the rabbit
