I DON'T KNOW!!  i have no fucking idea why we talk alone and i like him, but we get around other people and there's this fucking invisable wall between us.  AHHHHHH!  i think i'm going nuts.  HAHAHAHAHAHA lmao!  i'm listening to lostprophets make a move! OMG, and it's on shuffle, i had no control over it.  hahaha, way to much fruitopia, i've gone delusional.   [ people are trying to help me with this issue of mine, but i keep getting this feeling that i should deal with it on my own.  the thing is, i don't think i'll "make a move" on my own.  don't mine me being terrified of having my heart broken again... i'm not even joking when i say "my little heart can't take it".  oi with the poodles already.
