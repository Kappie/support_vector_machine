If I was to entitle this converstation:  Why Humans Suck So Much  and it was eye-opening. Sitting in the car, an interesting thought was proposed...why do we have friends? Why are there some people that we spend time with and share our lives with? Why does this happen?  Now this person that I was with, is rather negative and claims not to have any friends and prefers it that way. Then he explained his reasoning for not  wanting any friends ...and this is what I want to know share. I actually took something from this because there was no way to argue out of it.   "Everyone is this world will backstab, lie, cheat to better themselves. There is no one in this world that actually cares about how you are as a person anymore. The entire goal of the human race is to better themselves regardless if they are aware of it or not. No matter how good of a person or how christian you are, or how athesist, or how rich or poor, or criminal and sinful, in the simplest ways, you look out for your best interests. Example, man walking down the street (Man A) and lets say that Man A has $1000 in his pocket and Man B knew about the money and he could committ the crime and not get caught...what do you think Man B would do? What he couldn't fed his children? His wife has been laid off work? Man A has money to spare so he should share?  So Man B will look out for his best interests.   Alright, thats an extreme example, but heres a couple more... You're sitting on the toilet and run out of toilet paper as soon as your done wipping your own ass. You don't replace the roll because you are too lazy... or your at work and you leave something for someone else to do because you don't want to do cause you don't like it. Two examples of situations where...you have backstabbed someone. Backstabbed how? You have purposely left extra work for another person. You are looking out for yourself.   In every way, humans look out for themselves...I look out for myself. If I don't look out for myself who will? What?! Someone will call me selfish? Well...isn't that now what we are teaching our children??? Are we not teaching everyone around us to lie and be dishonest?  If a man came up to you and said, everything I say is a lie...is he telling the truth?   I want to go into politics...a career in which a normal human should thrive, as every person in this world has the qualities required for this line of work. You need to be able to lie, and cheat, and step on toes, and backstab all to better yourself. The average human does this...except politicans get paid for it.  Another example...you break up with someone and what is your first reaction? Reach out and cause pain...why?? Because it makes you feel better. Because you are looking out for number one...you are making yourself feel better about yourself.   If you don't have friends, you don't need to worry about being loyal to anyone but yourself. You look out for yourself, you help yourself...you get ahead in life.   Isn't this what our parents are teaching us?? To work to better ourselves? But do they realize at what this does?  We are just a thoughtless society.  You may ask...what about those people who volunteer their time and such...same thing. Same goal. Everyone is out for something and its better if we realize this truth earlier.   Am I saying...I don't want friends. No. I am not saying this. I am simply just saying that...this was a interesting concept. I am thankful for all that I have...but I don't think anyone understands what they really have. I don't fully understand...if I was so thankful, I would be able to give up everything...but can I? No, I am greedy and human.   Love yourself before anyone else. Love yourself before anyone else can. If you don't watch out for number one...no one else will.  With this...I look at the world with a jaded, hopefully will. I have my ideals and morals...and apparently I am up with "Free Love".  It is the experience, of what you make.
