Well, for once in this weblog, I'm going to address other people's issues before my own, because I'm worried about other people right now, I guess. I don't give a damn about you, Scaccia.    First of all, there's Ryan. He's really worrying me.. I think he's going through some serious stuff, but he won't tell me much.. If he happens to be reading this, I'm  so  sorry that I'm always talking so morbidly.. I think I know now how worrysome it must be, and I'll try harder not to be that way..    I wish I could feel sure that he's alright, and that if he isn't I would know so..    Then there's Candace. She's not eating, and she's beating herself up inside about it when she does. I'm extremely worried.. she could get seriously ill from not eating..    And then Ben... What worries me about him is all this about him not having many friends and the way it's more than likely affecting him. Social isolation--willful or otherwise--is unhealthy for the heart. God, I sound like a sucker, but I'm serious.. I wish things were better for him.    Why, you may wonder, am I not addressing my own issues like I'd usually do? I think it's because I don't really know what my own issues  are  anymore.  If I ever  did  know.  That pit of everlasting darkness has no explanation, I guess.  And I'll continue to fall until someone can reach me...     I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress   Hand full of anger, held in my chest   And everything left's a waste of time,   I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more    "Nobody's Listening" by Linkin Park
