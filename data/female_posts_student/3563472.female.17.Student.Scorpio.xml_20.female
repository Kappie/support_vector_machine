There was a small party going on there already with a RootBeer Keg. Kipp and Drew had a root beer drinking contest. Kipp won, of course. He had 10 1/2 cups of rootbeer and Drew had 9 (actually he cheated so he probably only had about 6 cups). Anyways.. Kipp puked twice. The first time he puked, Drew gave him a dollar to eat a piece of puke. It was rather disturbing, but still amusing. The second time he puked, it was like a fire hydrant. I've never seen so much puke in my life. And I've never enjoyed watching someone puke so much either. Drew puked once, but it was pathetic. He had to gag himself.. and it wasn't even enough to make him feel better. haha DREW SUCKS!! No, I love Drew. Anyways, it was decided that Root beer drinking is definately a spectator sport.
