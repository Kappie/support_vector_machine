If only someone would just take me away, even if it's only for one single day. Take me anywhere, somewhere where I can forget about everything on my mind temporarily, and just have fun. Someone who I love being around, just to have fun with me. Everything would get better. Everything.  My summer is going to hell. I haven't done anything. The best thing I have probably done this summer, is go to Mill Hall, and maybe watch some people lose their money gambling at the carnival. Grr, nothing to do here.  My brother is coming home soon, and I really don't want him to. I can't believe almost 10 days have gone by already since he has left. I have until Thursday to jack off.   Please, make everything get better.
