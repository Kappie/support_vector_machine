Supposedly there was also another accident in which a student died...it's all so depressing. I just want everyone to stay safe, and I really wish there was someone to talk to right now, but there isn't...everyone who would be online and who I could talk to is happily asleep. I seriously don't know whether to cry, or...what. I mean...I have cried...but, jeez, sometimes I wish I didn't care so much about people I don't know well. It wouldn't hurt as much if I only got upset over people I was really good friends with. It's just so unfair though. They're both so smart and nice...and....arg...just, why them??? Why the heck them....? I feel like I should tell the people I really care about how much I care about them, but...it's really hard for me to express my emotions like that. It makes me so sad though...so so so sad. I kind of wish I could go back to the days of elementary and junior high...at least people seemed safe there. No one ever got seriously hurt or died during either...  There's also that feeling like...I want to help somehow, but there's really nothing I can do. I mean...I'll pray, but somehow I feel that I should do something other than pray, something physical...I don't know anymore...maybe I just need to go clear my head....I was going to write about my day, but it doesn't really matter right now. I just hope they're ok...
