I huddled under its droopy broken spokes, and tried to walk quickly in the direction of the wind so I could stay dry.  I realised today that the rain you hear on your umbrella is greatly exaggerated and magnified.  It really sounds like its raining, but when you walk in the rain it's just a light pattering on your face.  You don't even really get wet.  I have a Tibetan friend who enjoys walking the rain -- a freak in China, where at the slightest drop, colourful cartoon umbrellas unfold like blooming flowers all over the street.  But I think he's right.  It's refreshing, it's good for us.  It's kind of an analogy to our attitude towards pain and suffering.  We try so hard to protect ourselves from it with our little puny broken ways, but when we finally stop fighting it, we realise it's good for us, it refreshes our relationship with God, it refreshes our comprehension of what is important.  Half the battle is in our fear of submitting to anything God throws at us.  Half the battle is won therefore, when we accept what has happened in our lives and let it mold and transform us -- not in a bitter twisted hiding behind a useless umbrella way; but in an honest, standing tall and trusting-in-God's-love-for-us way.
