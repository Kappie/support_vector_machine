Hopefully when he grows older, he will keep his impecable mannerisms, desire to learn, and quirky personality, because these are the qualities that that set you aside from the remainder of the 6 billion people in this world.   I am really liking the single scene... again. I like not being obligated to call, obligated to talk, you know, just the whole "obligation" of being there for another person. I don't think I'm very good at that. I'm not reliable. Not consistant. Although, I must admit, I am sure it wouldn't seem like such a hindrance, or such a downfall on my behalf, if I actually cared about the person. So, I guess I am not entitled to say that I am truly exhausted from making attempt. I cannot denounce what I have yet to experience-- meeting a person that will bring something out of my very depths that I have not seen before. However, people talk about how greatness and sheer optimism just seeps out of their pores when they are with someone that they love, but I've never heard someone admitting that a bad side surfaced. Is that because it doesn't happen, or because no one can bring themselves to admit that they failed at what is deemed to be the most natural, easy thing that could ever ever be done when the situation is real? I guess my point is that I think it is better off for me to be single, because I don't have "what it takes" to be with someone that I do not think the world of. And at this point in time, I think the world of no one.   I don't know where that came from. Goodnight to all, and have the sweetest of dreams.
