We also played like shit and got whipped 15-4, although I was happy to catch two in the end zone.  Frank had me handling a lot and I don't think I performed that well.  My throws under pressure are still way below standard.  I took Barrie home and since he was lonely without John or Liz, I stayed for a while and we watch High Fidelity.
