I guess it wasnt that bad, they just ran around and screamed a lot. Oh, and they got these hampsters and they kept hiding them places and i was freaking out cause i didnt want to lose them and get yelled at (or fired) (from my nannying... hahahahaha) (although maybe being fired would be the desired option....) ::ponder::  my head hurts! owww!  i went and saw Van Hellsing for the second time. Yeah, shut up. I didnt pay to get in, liz's boyfriend got us in by pretending that he worked at subway or something... i dont know. But laramie came... haha. that girl is so fucking hilarious. Every time im with her we just generate stupid and hilariousity and were probably really loud and annoying but thats ok, we make anything fun. Even shitty movies and stupid shit.  i really want to kick someone in the face, but i cant say who on here because everyone reads this crap ( i dont know why, i think my life is boring as hell...but whatever you all want to do, go for it). But yes. You! annoying stupid shithead! ::kick kick stab::  something in my room smells really bad, and i hope its not me. I really need to bathe and stop smelling like small kids and hampsters... its fucking disgusting. Maybe ill go do that.  oh yeah, that ashley girl keeps calling me and im sort of avoiding her... cause shes really creepy and.....creepy. I guess shes nice.. shes just insane. And shes a hot topic girl who tries way too hard to get friends.   uh. i think thats it. Tomorrow i have to take the kids to the swimming pool... and i dont have a car. Bus possibly? this could be hazardous. Hopefully i wont die.  i wonder when melissa gets back? if anybody knows, they should tell me   ~abby
