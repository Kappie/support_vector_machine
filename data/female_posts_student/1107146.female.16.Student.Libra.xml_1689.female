The northern colonies:  Ecnomically: Depended more on importaing/exporting, lumber, and fabrication of stuff as opposed to farming as the southern ones farm.  Regligously: Northern was more puritan and quaker, and I believe, also Rhode Island was the only colony to not have a "offical" religon.  Educationally: North had schools, first colleges up north, first primer schools, etc. The south has community schools where tutors were paid to teach communitys of kids (since plantations were far apart) or teach one kid.  Politically: Not sure, I think they had different charters and what not.  I hope all that info is correct, just a few notes that I picked up in US history this year. Anywho, good luck
