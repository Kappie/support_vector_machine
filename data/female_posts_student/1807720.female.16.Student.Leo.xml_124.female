In fact, I know that I KNOW everything on that quiz.  I do know it.  Just something happened, I lost focus, got discouraged by something I didn't understand.  In fact I thought the whole quiz was confusing.  Like some sort of unfamiliar foreign language.  I am really upset.  In fact I just wanted to cry during and quiz and after.  If I could I would of just let the tears roll, of course now being upset has built up inside of me.  I am still upset now actually.  I was doing so good in everything in Bio, and then this stupid quiz.  I know she said it was hard and that people do really bad on it, but I STUDIED SOOOOOO MUCH.  It hurts so bad because I know I deserve to do better, I know that I deserve it.    I know a lot of other people probably did bad too but I really really think I have a learning disability.  I don't care if it sounds stupid, or funny.  I don't care if people think I am really smart and that it's not possible, because of course I am smart but I DO BELIEVE it's possible.  I don't know what is wrong, but for a while now I have clued in that something about me is different.  Maybe not from the outside, but something is wrong!!  I used to even think I had a brain tumor or something crazy like that, until I realized that was crazy to think that.  I guess I just want an answer to my struggles.  When demands increase I can't keep up with it.  No one but myself knows really how often I cry trying to do homework and how many times I have wished to be dead because of my struggles.  All my life I have struggled with Math especially and aspects of English.  Especially the reading comprehension.  I used EVERY strategy that I have been taught throughout school and you know what I scored on the last reading comp. test in English - 35%.  The thing is that I have always struggled with it and people just ignore the fact, and it doesn't help.  Ever since I was introduced to reading comp. I have struggled with in, and I don't know how to pass those tests!  I used all the strategies and everything - so where do I go from there???  Honestly I don't know.  I don't know how I got through Chem, or math 20 last semester, I honestly don't - I suppose maybe it was because of my 200% effort I put into everything.  Of course it doesn't end there.  In fact jump in a car with me and you will learn a lot more.  I failed drivers ed.  You can't really understand what that does to your self-esteem until you have experienced it.  And guess who has experienced it - me.  Sometimes I wonder if I am just not ready to drive, but I feel ready.  Everyone always talks about how they want to drive and it's fun.  You know what I think when I hear the word driving - STRESS.  I'll admit it - Driving I find to be one of the hardest things.  Every time after the drivers ed class I would come hope crying.  I never did go for my license - why would I after failing drivers ed.  My parents just assumed that I am not ready.  No one ever stops to think that maybe that isn't the case.  Sometimes I wonder if maybe I am just a slow learner, but I don't think that's the right answer.  I mean everything points to some sort of learning disability.  Whether people see it or not, they are not the ones who live my life.  They should try walking in my footsteps  -Math being hard all my life -Failing/Barely passing reading comp. tests -Difficulty driving -Not understanding directions for labs (Which is why in Chem half of the time I just sat there during the lab - it's not because I didn't want to do it, it is because I didn't understand what to do) -Difficulty with relationships (Though I am sure lots of people have this problem)  To be honestly I find EVERYTHING difficult.  Whether I always show it or not, it's difficult.  No matter how good I may do in Social, or Religion or anything like that.  Plain and Simple - it's HARD.  All of it!  Not that I am saying life should be easy.  Other people excel at other subjects while they may not be strong in others.  I on the other hand am talented in the arts I suppose.  Not drawing wise.  Mainly Drama though I play the flute.  However it would be a lie to say that it isn't hard because learning and playing is a struggle and a challenge.  I wish I had answers.  Some sort of answers.  I wish someone could explain to me why everything is so difficult for me.  I wish someone could tell me why I struggle so much.  I wish I knew a way to change that, to be less stressed out, to not cry so often and have emotional breakdowns at night while "trying" to do my homework.  It's frustrating feeling like something is wrong, but the rest of the world doesn't seem to think so.  Maybe they're right, but I don't think so.
