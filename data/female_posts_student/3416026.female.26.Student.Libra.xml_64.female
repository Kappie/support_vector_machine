"A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals" is also only recently attributed, which makes it more exciting.  In the 1940s, one Han van Meegeren (oh god, I love Dutch names) forged a bunch of Vermeers and so "Woman Seated at the Virginals" (1670) was generally excluded from the artist's body of work (about 35 paintings, now 36).    Anyhow, some smart guy bought this in 1960 and later brought it to Sotheby's, who spent 10 years putting it under x-rays and such.  Now they're selling the painting and it's expected to go for like a thousand zillion dollars.  Actually, it's more like $5 million.  That seems like a wicked-lot, right?  But remember:  it's god-damned VERMEER.  You don't have to be an art-fool to know that he was at least a genius.  I'm not an expert on auctions, so maybe this just means it will actually sell for $5 billion, but bear this in mind:   The  urlLink ARTnews  cover story in the May 2004 issue was about super-expensive art.  For example:  - 1990: $82.5 million for Van Gogh's  urlLink Portrait of Dr. Gachet (1890) .  That's over 16 times as much for a Van Gogh.  And it's not, as they say, "the" Van Gogh.  I mean, it's a real Van Gogh but not the one that springs to mind when you think of him.  - 2001: $5.6 million for Jeff Koons'   urlLink Michael Jackson and Bubbles (1988) .  The same amount of money.  Jeff Koons.  Johannes Vermeer.  Hm.  Actually, that issue of ARTnews has all sorts of interesting facts about why a piece may or may not bring in a truckload of cash.  For example, if you're selling two Cezannes, one of melons and one of apples, the apples will do better because " 'The market prefers apples.' " (This is all from "Why 15 Apples Are Better Than 3" by Kelly Devine Thomas). Ooooookay.  I wonder whether "Young Woman Seated at the Virginals" will be negatively or positively affected by her shady past.  Also, they say it lacks some of the Vermeer-ness of his other paintings.  That certain light, the je ne sais quoi.  Actually, Sotheby's can probably savoir exactly quoi, but whatever.  You get the idea.  It'll be interesting to see how it turns out.  Anyhow, here's  urlLink nice little piece  about the connoiseurship, which is actually way more interesting than that word sounds.  [Snaps to my mom, who even sequestered in the styx of PA, brought this to my attention.]
