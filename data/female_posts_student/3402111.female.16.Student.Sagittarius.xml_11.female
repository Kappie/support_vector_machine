Well, yeah.... so I am gonna go do that... eventually....  This is the last day of summer! But it was a good last day. The weather was nice and I got to drive with the windows down. I haven't been able to do that in ages. 'Twas nice. And I will hopefully get to talk to Liz and see how Jasper is! I can't believe she is getting a Great Dane!! I am soo excited. Which may seem kinda strange as she, not I, is getting the dog. Oh well...  I am getting a good start on the all-state music. I can't play worth ____. But that's alright. I  will  be able to play come auditions. So... not much interesting to talk about today. Which isn't that much of a change from every other day.... hahaha... i crack myself up.... so sad...  Well off i go to clean and practice....
