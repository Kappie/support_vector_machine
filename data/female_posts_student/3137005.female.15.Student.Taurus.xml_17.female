('Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play  Hey now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid,  And all that glitters is gold  Only shootin stars break the mold')  That is sooo my motto, stuff the people who say it isn't true, all that glitters is gold, even that funny congealed jam at the back of my fridge!  England won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've kinda lost my voice, but................who cares!!!!!!!!!!!!! We won!!!!!!! We won, we won, we won!! we won, we won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Come on england come on england. Roooooney Roooney sorry, it's jonathan's fault really, he encouraged me to shout. Not that he actually told me to shout 'what are you doing you great pansy run!' at the telly, but he did chant rooney. Today has been like THE best day this year, it was just soooooo good! We just dossed in grapics, danced in phsce (and made teachers think we were funny in the head( not forgetting our confuddling of Mrs Gregson)),  history was history and we finished the medical bit of said course, English ( as I think you will all agree was just sooo stupid yet fun (poof!)), and Art was groovy as usual. WE won the match, and then danced in the street. I had jammy dodgers, and rice and chilli for tea. Overall today was fun fun fun fun fun fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love summer, I get to wear my nice clothes, like my black sequiny top I have on now! It rocks, the world rocks, I rock, Roonet Rocks. Croatis do not rock, they must smell cheese. I love the world, rock on worldy-poo, we love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Love to you all! Goodnight!! Dani
