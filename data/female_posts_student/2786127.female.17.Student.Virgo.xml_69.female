Everything else that has happened in my life, all the hurt, all the pain, all the people...they're trapped too. Trapped in here with me where i must rexperience them each day. I need out. I need to spread my wings and become someone else. I can't take my world any longer. I wan't to say that someone needs to save me...but only I can this time.
