I woke up this morning at 5:24, very confused as to why I was sleeping in my clothes. Yay for little naps. So today I'm supposed to go shopping with mark. He hasn't called me to tell me when he's going to pick me up. Erm... I dunno. If I'm going to be bitching about that maybe I should go take my shower so I'd actually be ready when he calls.  You fit into me    You fit into me  like a hook into an eye    a fish hook  an open eye
