I was just thinking on the long, local train ride home from school tonight, as I listened to the new love of my life, i.e. my iPod.  I have it set on shuffle, so I never know what song I'm going to get next, and up came "Someone in a Tree" from  Pacific Overtures .  And I thought, "Hmm...I wish they'd revive that show.  I'd really, really like to see it."  Then I come home and find out they are.  Crazy.  Sometimes, I awe myself.  Actually, I almost always awe myself, but not in a good way like now.  And while we're at it, we've got more Broadway news and reason #28, as well as how depressingly out of touch I am with all of that which I used to love.  There's a  urlLink revival of  Jumpers  on Broadway .  I remember reading this play and loving it, though with Tom Stoppard plays, I think it really helps to see them.  So I know what I'll be doing once my new loan money comes in.    It's so nice to have things to look forward to.
