Just when I thought that I could handle it any more that I had absolutley no one to talk to I decided to just sit and chill on the benchs beneath my flat.  Who walks by  but Ben from the other day and he has a Zara bag!!! ZARA WOOHOO.  SO we are chatting and then this girl Alona walks by and she introduces herself and we start chatting and we have tons to say!  She was going to her firend's house to do homework so I joined her and met and other girl.  These girl both go to UCSD (the school I applied to in california).  The girl's who aparemtent we were in starts talkign aobtu her boyfriend and how they had to break up cuz  he wasn't jewish and how senstivae and alone she flet so far away from her family and I was like YES I"M NOT ALONE!!! and yea  these girls ( Miriam is her name) was great! and from there the night just got better.  We ended up going to this super store plaza with a group of people and I chatted with all of them and eneded up staying for coffee with Blare and Dina.  I"Ve now convinced several girls to coem to try capoeria.. everyone suprising seems to know what it is and be interested in it! Wow its ike magic .. all of a sudden i have access to all these new poeple.  It happened so quickly and it happened just when I needed it most.  I am a lucky girl.  Let's see what happens next!      by the way guess what Mega store was in this plaza?  OFFICE DEPOT.  sheesh
