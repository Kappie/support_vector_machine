Can't get any better than that. As my wallet has been 'topped-up' *smug* I can now afford my Only Fools And Horses DVD, Max Payne II (when it comes out in about a month) and I can also take Nic out for a classy meal when I get round to it one weekend. Corny. I have also done most of my homework so far. I'm hardly lagging which gets me in a happier mood :) P.S: BRAND new absolutemaxpayne.co.uk due for release in about 3 weeks (just before release, how convenient). Kinky.
