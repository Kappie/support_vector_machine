HAPPY STUFF. this weekend, was AWESOME! i definitely need to head back to that sari shop and get some material of my own. I wanted to wait until I had a few more dollars in my pocket before i went and spent a whole ten dollars on something useful. i do get paid today for pet sitting so it's a definite possibility. and i got a nice little check yesterday for babysitting (and well, er, being a camp counselor for K-2nd graders at a church choir camp. oh yeah. you read that right). but i'd like some of that material to decorate, and SOME TO WEAR. one of hte ladies at the shop showed me how to wear the sari, and damn it, it looks good!! they've really got something going on there...  hey wow that was a whole paragraph there. go hedish.  well, the weekend was all around great. i had a bit of down time, which i'm sure everyone could tell. i just wasn't feeling myself, and i was letting things get to me. and i realized things this week too, which has made getting over things (and people) much easier.  a whole hell of alot easier. to the point where i'm finished with this. no problems, no worries.  plus this coming saturday is gonna rock as well. (do a danny "rock" motion here.)  i love that if a full scentence is in parenthesis, you put the punctuation inside. i just love doing that.
