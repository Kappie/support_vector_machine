I've been searching for the bloody website for ages and ages! :) Ahh now I can mess up the wonderful layout... how fun. I just have to put a link to it here incase I forget it again *noooo!* But hopefully I should remember it! The colour codes page is just too helpful! Yeay! *so simple minded* Yup, aren't elastic bands cool? On a random note somewhere on my desk: I have a pirate bandana! Woohooo!
