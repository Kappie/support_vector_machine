There is no reason to be lonesome, none at at all, except for one, and that is that I don't have a boyfriend! I know that I am spending WAY too much time obsessing over this subject but I can't help it! I'm a teenager afterall! Don't nearly all teens obsess over their love lives? Okay, maybe it's not just a boyfriend that I'm craving for... Maybe, I'm really desiring someone that actually gets me... Ugh! You'd figure that after being yourself for thirteen years, that you would know how you thought or felt about certain things, but obviously I'm not lucky enough to possess such a sense.     I probably secretly desire for both. Or a two in one. Like, I most likely, subconsciously wish for a boyfriend that completely understands almost everything about me. That's a long shot wish, isn't it? Every girl or woman probably desires the exact same thing as I do... Well, if they can't find anyone that fulfills this then what are my chances for finding someone like this? Seriously, what are the odds that I'll find someone that even wants to know me? Oh, I know, the chances are exactly in the range from zero to none... No one will ever truly care about me... No one ever does...      Hopefully, one day, if I'm fortunate enough to have both my personality and looks repaired, someone out there will care about me and the rest of my life. One day, most likely when I'm older, I'll meet that someone, at least I hope so... It would be great to find someone that either feels the same way I do about specific topics or someone that is willing to try to get to understand why I am the way I am and other stuff pertaining to that... That would be positevely, completely, utterly, and wholly magnificent if I could find someone like that... I know I'd never let them go...     Anyways, I'm gone...
