And whoever creates the Strong Bad website should be cheesy well shot alongside cheesy Chaucer for not creating a characters page for the cheesy brilliant 'eh steve' who was introduced to me tonight by Benjamin. Woo go Ben. Now I am in a cheesy cheesed off mood for many a reason. In fact my stupid cheesy mood has made me have a go at Charlene for no real cheesy reason and now I feel cheesy well bad about it so sorry to anyone I have bitched to today my apologies.  And I was going to write pages and more cheesy pages but to be honest I can cheesy well be cheesed.
