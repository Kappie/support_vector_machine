Well, I'm gaining some valuable life lessons, and that's about all I can say.  Mommy and Daddy should be proud... "Our little girl is growing up." Whatever. Growing up is disgusting. :-)  Tennis NEC's were last Saturday! Yay! They were great. I lost to Edgewood's Andrea Essig, obviously, but I did play the best ever on her. I did score like 4 points, and I was quite satisfied. My consolation match, well, that was easy enough. I won 8-0. Then, my true feat of the day, I beat the Lakeside girl 8-2! Last time I played her, she and I were tied all the way through, and I was intimidated.   Marie has got that "I've got Jessi, I don't need you attitude lately," and I hate it, but there's nothing I can do. Heather and I are the same, kind of in some kind of screwed up limbo land where nothing is wrong and everything is amusing. Well, I guess its better than arguing with her, and wondering why she's my friend. I've also made a lot of little acquaintences in most of my classes, and thats great. In my mind at least. Friends make class time fly by!  I've got an AP test tomorrow, and I'm supposed to be studying now (notice the key word there: supposed). I've got a pretty good chunk down, but a lot to go. But I needed a break! (And the other part of me contradicts: Yeah right, Jennica, you just don't want to do it)
