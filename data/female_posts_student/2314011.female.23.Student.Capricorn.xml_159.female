But I've amassed an interesting collection of quotes from the day (just today) that must be posted without any context whatsoever to set them up.  This is why I write down funny random quotes, my friends, because they always pay off later:  "What is a cow?"  "Good."  "Then we'll have the plaintiffs testifying about how they didn't do anything to get cancer; the Moms thought they were protecting their unborn children.  It's time to bring out the violins."  "It was one of those 'see 12 countries in 2 days' kind of things."  "If we were all the same, without any differences in views or opinions, we would all be Russian."  "Yoga can help that, you know."  "Can it make my boobs stop growing?"
