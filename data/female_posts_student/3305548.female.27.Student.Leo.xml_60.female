Beyond the time involved in my work, my brain is fried after I am done for the work-day. Plus, I have the strings of school tugging at me with summer courses that are the educational equivalent of "quick and dirty." There is alot to handle in a short period of time. Please forgive me my few readers, and know that I will be catching up in a big way this weekend - hopefully to never get quite so far behind again. However, for the remainder of the summer I would only guess that I will be able to post twice a week or so...at least until summer camp and or summer school winds down.  With that....a mini-recap of what has happened since my last posting:  Ralph Nader has not replied to my email. How rude!  I took a vacation for what was Week 3 of summer camp, but we were unable to go camping as planned due to a mousey invasion involving the turning of our tent floor into a swiss cheese style piece of performance art. Instead we spent a week relaxing (and me studying for a final exam for summer school.) We took time to make sure we lounged around, and my husband went fishing.  And of course I got sunburned. Even with sunblock on. My husband's fishing = me getting sunburned. The more fish he catches the worse the sun damage is. I swear there must be an equation somewhere that explains the ratio and size of fish as relative to the pain and redness of a sunburn. I will post some pics of the fist he caught this weekend. He threw them all back – I think its shameful for people to fish or hunt for food when they have other food sources equally as available to them.  My job at summer camp has changed slightly. When I came back from my "vacation" I found that some people had been fired, some things had been switched around, and in general I had missed some good gossip - not that I pay attention to work-related gossip mind you! I would now be manning the sign in/sign out table for summer camp where the parents essentially check in and out their children from the YMCA like they were baggage at a baggage claim or books in a library. I have done this job before and I don't mind it. I have alot of experience communicating with parents, although I do now miss getting to actually spend time with the kids. Plus I had just stocked my backpack with a summer campers dream - games galore, card decks, drawing supplies, crossword puzzles, dominoes, uno, etc. So my bag o'fun was now rendered practically useless to the kids since I was at the table addressing the issues that their parents bring up. Isnt that just another example of Murphy's Law and timing. When a person is aptly prepared and experienced with something, they will no longer be asked to do it and instead be informed they will do something else for which they must make entirely different preparations. Such is life.  Movies I have seen and shall review include: Around the World in 80 Days, Dodgeball, Terminal, Stepford Wives, Spiderman II, and the all-important Fahrenheit 9/11. Rentals including: The Producers, Flashdance, and some old episodes of “The Saint” and BBC Sherlock Holmes TV Movies from the library.  Video game to be reviewed: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.  We were supposed to go on vacation last weekend to Deep Creek Lake, MD to see my family and have a nice Fourth of July. However last Friday I developed a severe case of vertigo which left it impossible for me to travel in the car even for short trips without serious dizziness and nausea – little of all the entire trip to Maryland. This past week has been something between Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo” and Mel Brook’s “High Anxiety” – and in either case has been the result of an inner ear viral infection that has thrown my balance for a loop. I am still recovering as I type. I have improved significantly, but car rides still make me woozy to the point of lack of ability to function. All in all I havent really been back to work since Friday. I was there for a couple of hours yesterday but I was mostly useless and not able to see straight enough to mark the right kids as present on the roster when they arrived!  Hmmm…otherwise life goes on.  My husband bought me a stuffed bunny rabbit to cheer me up while I was sick. The rabbit is so darn cute for a stuffed animal. I named it FlapJack. It’s still new but already I can’t sleep without it. I think summer camp is making me regress. I caught up on Sluggy Freelance a few days ago. (My favorite online comic as some of you may remember)  During my “getting behind on my blog” interval I also read about blog sites starting to charge for their services. I hope this doesn’t happen with my blog provider. It seems to be counter productive to the whole concept of free internet publishing to charge money for the service. *shakes head in wonderment* But I suppose it is the fate of all good things about the internet to eventually cost money. I just hope I don’t lose this record of Blogs due to some paying set up someday.  Well I will catch up further over the weekend per my promise. I hope everyone out there in blog land is doing well and taking care.  That’s all the news in fits of print. --Mack
