Heh. A little peek into my daily life. In case you were wondering I am Tevren7891, and I said "but"+t. Ha, I crack myself up but not. Anyway meeting up some people and watching movies, probably Braveheart, Shari's favorite. Today was fine expect that I saw a damn Hummer again. It caused me to be blind for three seconds. Also the world is now collapsing if you haven't noticed. Was walking Jaun's dog with him when I noticed that a homeless man had nice leather cushions. Man, a homeless guy with leather cushions! Tired to get the dog to piss on the cushions but it wouldn't. Then tried to make it piss on a really nice car, but again it wouldn't. Life Sucks real bad since that dog didn't piss on the hot car (not Hummer, yet I can dream).
