       
      The four of us (Austin, Connor, Sara without an H and me, Sarah) organized this mostly because we were bored, but because we (Sara and I, since we got this whole thing rolling) also wanted to start kind of an opinionated blog, where we could post what we think mainly about things going on in the world and in the church, but occasionally other various topics may arise (like Austin's brother's "job").  At any rate, our little motto is, appropriately, "all for One and One for all." This is not only a statement meant to unite us in our friendship, like it is in the story of The Three (or Four) Musketeers. It means more than that to us - all for One, as in Jesus Christ, the one we live for, and One for all, because Jesus is the savior of ALL mankind, and he is the ONLY way to get to heaven. That is what we believe - we're on this road together, and we're not afraid to stand up for Him.
