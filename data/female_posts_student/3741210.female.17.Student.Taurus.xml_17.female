Maybe you people will come visit me tomorrow when I work. That would be nice   So then Catie im-ed me about going out to lunch with Kathryn and Kelly because they're going out of town. Kelly to Michigan and Kathryn to work crew for three weeks. Bye dearies, have fun! Catie had to go go home for a trumpet lesson so then Kel, Kath and I rented Mystic Pizza--which was ok. The ending you would expect from a chick flick. I wish I worked in a cute little pizza joint...  My brother John is being a meany (like my nice grown-up word?) and he's blaring the TV until I get off the computer so it looks like I gotta jet. You people better call me tonight! Toodles. (Thanks Amit for the great new word)
