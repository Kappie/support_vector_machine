He's married now, and the wedding was beautiful... And I really do send them my congratulations because I want them to be happy. But, now I see the difference in him that I could never figure out. All I gots to say is, thank goodness my life is NOT edited for TV... there's just something extremely bland about that and I couldnt live my life that way. My parents arent happy with every decision I make, but they know I am old enough to know better and that usually I have good judgement. I just dont always have good judgement with guys... which tends to become a problem more often than not. Well life is all about trial and error- and I've decided I want to share my journey with everybody- no matter who it is. I have a few people that blessedly read my blog a lot- and it's not like I'm trying to spice it up to gain the interest of anybody- everybody tells me my life is like a soap opera anyways- instead of me repeating a story a million times, I'd rather tell it once.  So I heard about blogs from a couple friends and all of a sudden, here I am posting with the best of them. It makes me glad now that things never worked out with the ex. I could never be with him- I would die from the boredom. My life is exciting- a little too much drama at times, but I love it. I get to meet all kinds of people- and I'm about to force my way into a band some way somehow I swear. I like life on the party side, not on the normal side. My life has a lot of changes from day to day, so I never know what I'm going to be doing or who I'm going to be with. I dont know if I"m gonna be with dave... I dont know if I wanna pursue something with the person I'm kinda seeing... I just go with the flow now and it's killing me. But... there's always new things coming along and I'm happy in the life that I"m living, so I cant complain. I got to go see an awesome band last night at Jamies in Garden City- Ray Street Park. They totally rawked and they were sexy as hell- all of them. I went with Ryan, met up with Kristin and Megz, then met Bina, Beki, Christine (motor), Nina, Chrissy, Jessie, Gene, Kari, Fred, (I'm so bad at this so forgive me) and whoever else was there- dont let me forget Moo my fav buddy buddy. I had fun with all you guys that band rocks and we definitely have to do tha again. I will write on Monday about the rest ofthis weekend :D
