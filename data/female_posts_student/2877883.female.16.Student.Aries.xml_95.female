Maine.  Lovely/slightly boring.  No friends.  A slight tan.  More freckles.  Back sunburn, one stripe.  Too many s'mores.  I guess that's why they call them s'mores.    I need to develop interests.  I have none.  And everything bores me.  But funny how being bored doesn't seem to bore me considering I am bored very very often.    Harry Potter 3=tres soon.  Going to see it with Miss Carolina in our holy nerdiness a.s.a.p.  And Maybe Meliss too, if she wants.  I shall see, we must hold up our Harry Potter tradition.  And don't go questioning our extreme coolness.    I want Nikki's purse soooo badly.
