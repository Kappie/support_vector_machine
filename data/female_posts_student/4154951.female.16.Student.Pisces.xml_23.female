(Note to self: ask her to send the invitation  again .)       Kate's behind me trying to set up her own blog, and Anna's on another computer doing...God knows what.      I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I don't have a chance with * whisper Mark whisper *. Sad... But I'm training myself to think about him less and less.. It's kinda working.. NOT. ='o{      BlogSpot isn't working for Kate and Anna...for some reason. *gives blogspot.com the evil eye*   This is just  great . Pushes us one more step back from being able to set up our group blog...Grr. >o[      Something tells me I should do work... In a minute, that  something  will be my teacher. Hm.. what classes have I got tomorrow? English, Religion, IPT, PDHPE and S Grrreat. Pretty bad, considering the only subject I like out of those five is IPT. I guess the other subjects are alright, since I have buds..but I just don't like learning without computers!!      BlogSpot  still  isn't working for Kate and Anna... It won't let them register.. Keeps going back to the main screen... =oS  This sucks majorly...      Well I'm gonna sign out... =o[
