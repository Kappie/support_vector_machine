Is it where you are living now, or somewhere else (ie: Mom  Dad's house, particular state/city)?  I still consider the Philippines to be my home. I particularly miss Tanjay and the simple life. Mom and Dad built a new house there. The construction is complete and the landscaping is half-way done. It just needs to be furnished. I hope to take Brian there next year so he can see what it was like to grow up in the province.     3. What makes it home for you? People? Things?  Everything. The people, the animals, the things.. The sights, smells and sound. The food! I miss authentic Pinoy food so much!     4. Where is the furthest you've been from home, miles-wise?  Here.     5. What are your plans for this weekend?  Stripping wallpaper (some more), visiting Mom and checking out her new dining room ensemble.. Watching  The Time Machine .. Getting Brian's hair cut at the mall.. Redeeming yet another Express coupon.
