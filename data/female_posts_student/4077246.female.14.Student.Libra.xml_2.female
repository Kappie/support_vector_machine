She is old! lol     Well I'm not sure what I should do about this problem I have cause I think I like someone but I don't want to hurt someone else who likes me.  If that makes any sense to you..congradulations to you.     Josh told me that I need to grow up more so that I can make commitments. But i am only 14(almost 15 YAY!)  But I had better get of the comp before my rents get mad at me for not doing my homework yet...lol...BUH BYES!
