I am about to leave the house to go to 3 or 2 (one of them might have to be cancelled) doctors' appointments. Fun-ness, right? Well it's better than school. God I have a lot of work to do. Study for English, study for IPC, Geometry, my mousetrap car. I hope there isn't anything else, I don't think I can take it, lol. The only thing that keeps my going is... my seven nation army... lol. I'm having a spaz now.  Well I luv u all, got to go. ~*Philadelphia Cream Cheese*~
