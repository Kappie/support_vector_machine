This is a giant  FECK YOU!  to all the fat people here in my area who park in handicapped spaces when their only visible handicap is fat.  Fat is not a fecking handicap.  You are the people who SHOULD be parking further away because you could acutally use the excercise you huge, fat, gross mess!  I don't know what you're paying the idiots at the DMV to issue you that handicapped hang tag but you're taking valuable parking away from my grandmother, who is legitimately handicapped (she can barely see and has a hard time walking).  Similarly I am someone who could also use one of those hang tags.  I have Lyme Disease and when it starts to act up its extremely painful to be mobile because my hips and knees are so stiff, but I still must travel to the end of the parking lot and walk past your fat ass stuffing bags of ho-ho's and twinkies into your car like there was about to be a shortage of them.   You are the same people who get scooters at theme parks and casinos becuase you're too fecking fat to walk around, yet you're the first one to nearly run my ass over to get to the buffet line at the casino.  Honestly, why are you even bothering to go to Great Adventure or Disney World?  Your disgusitng, morbidly obese body wont fit into any of the ride cars.  Then you'll sue them because they're insensitive to your needs.  Unfortunately a panel of jurors will award you the cash to try and "stick it to the big corporations with all the money"....not realizing they're raising many of their prices to deal with the reprocussions of all of these frivolous law suits that morons like you are starting.  I hope you get taken out Mama Cass style.  Feck you, pigs.
