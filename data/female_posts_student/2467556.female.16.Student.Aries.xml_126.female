Like i said, Nathaniel Zastrow, you're stuck with me forever and ever and there's nothing you can do about it lol.  so we made up today and we're cool now.....even though he won't stop apologizing and he says that he won't stop apologizing for what he did until the end of time.....i dunno how long i can take that for, lol. Jimmy was really nice about the whole thing when i was really angry/sad and i told him all about it.....he told me alot of things that made me laugh and feel better lol.    Vivace show tonight....i was supposed to go with Jessi but i decided not to.....i'm kinda tired and want to just hang out at home.  This week sucked the life out of me for now...  Tampa Bay kicked ass last night.....Vincent Lecavalier scored a goal! It was exciting. maaan he's one hot quebecois canadian! I signed him over to Brittany on certain conditions, one of which was promising not to get pregnant with his children (LOL Britty!!!).  But i get to have rights to say he's mine on every holiday except Christmas and New Years.  I kinda did owe Britt after she gave me Patrik Elias at last year's Cup Finals.  And I also got Paul Kariya last year too after he was traded to Colorado.  So she did kinda deserve Vinny.  haha, this is sad....we're handing over these players that a) are taken or b) married and c) we have absolutely no chance with, like we own them or something lol.  me and britt are crazy.  oh yeah, Brittnee told me that Jimmy Meyer and Jenna whatsherface got back together.....interesting considering that he cheated on her several times (according to various sources) with several different girls.  haha that reminds me, today in french, we gossipped about the entire hockey team....it was amusing, i'm going to miss them all so much :)  In BCIS, me and rachna made a power point about my life in 10 minutes.....thats how bored we are in that class....  OH!!  MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE WHOLE DAY!!!  Today, in Brittany's KCBY class, she got to HUG THE GREAT SAM PARNELL!!!  AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!  So exciting, i wish i was in KCBY!!  AND he remembered her!!!  She said he's really grown and gotten really hott now.....woooow....maybe i need to go to TCU lol  alright, i'm hungry (shutup rachna lol)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
