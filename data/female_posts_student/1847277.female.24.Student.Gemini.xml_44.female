I honestly don't know what's wrong with me this semester- I have these crazy, inexplicable mood swings- I periodically get terribly depressed or really angry at the world, and then something will click and I'll go back to being happy Jamie.  Or at least normal Jamie, who is crazy but still generally content with life.    And what's with this use of the third person?  Blargh.  I really can't figure out which end is up anymore.
