I've been to his place maybe two times, but I'm so awful with directions, so.  I thought of taking a cab, but what would I tell the driver? `My friend's apartment, please?` Sheesh. I decide to go to Kyoto University instead and call my friend from a payphone there. He lives nearby and we were really supposed to go there anyway... Then at least when I ask for directions, people will know where I want to go...  Okay. Time to paractice my Japanese. I go around stopping friendly-looking, not-too-much-in-a-hurry Japanese. `Um... Sumimasen, Kyodai wa doko desu ka?` They smile, say, `Massugu (straight ahead)` then `migi ni magatte (turn right).` Right. Massugu then migi, massugu then migi, massugu then migi. Sounds simple enough. Right.  Right. Right. Right. Yeah, right. Where to turn right? I tried to ask how many blocks (or stoplights, as Japaanese tend to use shingou as landmarks) before I turn, but the old man started speaking very fast, I couldn`t understand anything! So I just bowed my head as if I understood, `sumimasened` him for his trouble, and walked on, waiting for something to look familiar and tell me I was near Kyodai.  After about 20 minutes, I give up. I ask a nice Japanese lady who can speak a little English. She asks, `Are you just walking to get there? ` That should've been my clue! I was so far away people were wondering how I could just walk it to Kyodai! (And believe me, the Japanese  like  to walk!  It's time to face facts: I am hopelessly lost. In true xx chromosome fashion, I don't hesitate to ask for directions. I enter a shop and ask to see a map. The proprietor tells me I have to take a bus and get off at Hyakumanben. All this was a jumble to me, and all I heard was bus and hyaku man en (one million yen).  I thought the bus fare cost hyaku man en! No way can I afford a bus! I mean, I know prices here are ridiculously high compared to the Philippines, but, c'mon! A million for a bus ride? Do I get to sit on Hiroyuki Sanada's lap or something?  Finally I give up and take a cab. (Which upon later examination, is increadibly stupid, given the assumption that buses cost one million yen). Fifteen minutes and around 1,200 yen later, I got to Kyodai safely and sanely, met my friend, and lived on to survive two weeks in Japan.  And yeah, I've taken the bus to school once or twice. They cost 220 yen. And nope, no Hiroyuki Sanada.
