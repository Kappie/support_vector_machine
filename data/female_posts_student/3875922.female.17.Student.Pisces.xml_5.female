THEN.   we went to go to the other tent, then rorystop this guy called Milton who was with this guy. rory and milton are in the same music tech class. there was this guy who was next to milton, who was introduced to us by simon. SIMON!?!?!?! OH MY GOD.... and it was a spitting image of that "simon" ihad this crush on,when i wasfiveat the grange. so i asked him, then it was that simon! he was like "yeah, i was in yellow class!!!" i couldnt rememeber whichclass i was in, but all i rememeber was the fact that, "i bloody fancied the pants off you, and i used to alwaysrun afteryou when we played catchy kissy.... i even bloody includedyou into my GCSE english essay!". i was going to tell him that, but then i realised that i would've sounded like such a child-whore, fancying someonewhen i was merely5years old... so i didnt. milton was at the grange too, apparently..... who the hell is he??? havent the slightest clue... AND there arent any bloody photos from grange school in my house! theres one... and thats pretty crappy.  noooooooooooooooooo   since ive left the grange, ive been reunited with Uba, Simon, and Louis   christ  xxk
