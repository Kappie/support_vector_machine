I have been hooked on finding out what all these famous musicians have ordered in their riders.    urlLink Red Hot Chili Peppers :  Meditation Room: All walls pipe and draped med to dark color please (prefer not blue) per advance.  After ordering all this 'healthy crap like soy yogurt, flavored rice cakes and yogurt and carob covered raisins...they ordered a box of Lucky Charms? White Socks, Black Socks, Boxers, TShirts (is this the alternative to having your mother buy that stuff for you)    urlLink Backstreet Boys : 16 32oz bottles of water for stage NO GAS (what does no gas mean?)   urlLink Puffy : Hennesey, Alize, Milk, Cristal, Dom Perignon  MY PERSONAL FAVORITE: urlLink  Jennifer Lopez : White Room, White flowers, White tables and/or tablecloths, White drapes, White candles, White couches Flowers: Yellow roses with Red Trim (*$55.00 for 10) White Lilies (*$45.00 for 6) White Roses (*$65.00 for 12) Diptyque Candles: (*sell for $42.00 each)Tuberous, Figure, Heliotrope Music:About 25 CD's  In summary, can I be a rock star?!?! I mean...their riders have more things on them than my Christmas Lists!!   urlLink The Smoking Gun Backstage Pass   Over the past couple of years, The Smoking Gun has published excerpts from the backstage riders of a few dozen performers. But that assemblage has not been extensive enough for demanding TSG visitors, so we've gone out and obtained loads of new riders. So many, in fact, that our backstage collection now covers a whopping 134 acts--everyone from Frank Sinatra and the Rolling Stones to Kenny G and KC  the Sunshine Band. The contract rider includes specifications on stage design, sound systems, lighting rigs, as well as an artist's wish list--from transportation and billing to dressing room accommodations and meals. In some cases, a promoter will refuse a demand (crossing out the request on the document), though stars usually get what they want, whether it's clean boxer shorts (Jane's Addiction), prune juice (Kansas), or an arrangement of tulips, roses, gardenias, and lilies (Janet Jackson). For some groups, TSG has obtained riders from more than one tour, so we've chosen excerpts from the most entertaining document in the lot. In addition, we've used red arrows to point out some interesting sections on individual riders--though we're sure you'll find many other personal favorites. And since we've now built a permanent home for these backstage documents, we'll add riders to this section as we obtain them, so check back to see what's new.
