Bugs, slugs, and caterpillars. Ewwyyy...  Because I'll be with my buddy, mother nature, as well as some closer friends, (LOL)I won't be able to post anything until later on Sunday night. Hopefully, I will have finished chapter seven, and I will have it up. It's always (and very) possible that I will be distracted to the point of no return on this trip, and won't even touch it. Hey! A little air is good for writer's block... Isn't it? *Goes green*  Even though it looks as if I'm dreading this weekend, in some bizzare way, I'm looking forward to the muck of a lake and the cool winds of an Canadian summer night. (Hey... I like that... :d).   I hope to writer again soon. Lets just hope I make it though. *faints*
