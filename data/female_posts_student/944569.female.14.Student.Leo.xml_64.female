You know, science is bad but the school couldnt stand that so they had to make it FRENCH--> AND  Why do i need french science anyway?  i live in an English society!  I think TFS does not realize most of their students dont know the english names of the digestive system!  HELLOOOO!!!!!  most students are just learning french as a little extra!  we dont want to do divisions like ppl in France do!!  SHEESH!  Most students are also going to be going to ENGLISH university!!!  " Ms.  Leung what is the name of the tube that transports food into the stomach?"  "I dont know, sir.  I went to a French School but i do know that it is called  un Oesophage......"  "  I dont speak French, Ms. Leung!  And, it's called an ESOPHAGUS!  Idiot!  Kids learn that in Gr. 5!  Go sit in the corner!"  Nicole: * puts on yellow cone with the words " Dumbass" on it and sits in the corner*  * Class points and laughs*  Nicole: * Frowns and gets expelled*
