I love caramello, twix, reese's, three musketeers, hershey's white chocolate, and white crunch candy bars.   I'm having the most horrible dreams.  Last night, I dreamt that me and I. went on a date, and at the end of the night, I went inside and let a snake in (then I woke up)!  The night before, both of us were rehearsing a scene from Romeo  Juliet, a kissing scene, and we were just up to the part when I woke up.  I can't understand why he has to invade my dreams.  The last time I dreamt about someone THIS much, I was in like with him (I've never been in love).  The difference: I HATE A. with a passion.  And no, there's absolutely no chance I've crossed the thin line between love and hate.  He's conceited, self-absorbed, cruel, annoying, thinks he's much more intelligent than he really is (I'm ranked higher in our class), rude, and short (well that lines up with my type, but I could never even tolerate the other characteristics).   Well my stomach doesn't feel so good, so I'll keep it at that.  Later.    Watch the hands!  Hey, they're your money maker! You're not too fond of having a camera stuck in your face all the time, so you'll let your hands do the work!  Brilliant!    urlLink   What Kind of Model are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
