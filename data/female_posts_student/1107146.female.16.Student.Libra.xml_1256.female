Apparently my mom thought really late was 12:30 so Gunter had to drop me home early...that was the only bad part about yesterday....I hate curfews....bleh. Laser Quest was great.....but the guys kicked the girl's butts.....take the girl's score times 2 and add like 5,000...yeah......Killing tyree....Anyway it was fun fun fun. Got to know some peeps better but guess what!! they're leaving soon...crap. Also pedchenko is now dating Haley woods....as Becca predicted and I confirmed so...be nice to Becky on that point. We first just bummed at Erika's house and then booked it to Laser Quest with the girls in erika's van and guys in gunter's car. Well...yeah they got there in like 5 min but we got lost. We had to call the place and ask for the addy but we decided not to tell the guys that we got lost....we had to get gas right? of course? but no....the guys running the place told gunter, tom, and them and @.@..they wouldn't shut up. So yeah they had their egos inflated for awhile...till erika beat them all on the second game....*smirk* then we stopped at Relay for Life...or what not...interest....really interesting....they had this talent thing going and wow...nails on the chalk board would have been better than some...bumped into Steven and Jason... they were going to sing but I wasn't going o spend my night waiting for them to go since they were last so we stopped at Block Buster for 8 miles....yeah don't smirk...my mom isn't going to know. We raced home...of couse gunter wins....erika never speeds that badly and you know that turn at franklin to concord.....see if there are any tire marks......let's just say that if we were in my explore....ouch! He almost went on to that triangle. *shakes head* what's with guys and winning.  So it's like 11:30 already when we get to her house. Her mom freaks out saying: i don't care that you're here but are you parents ok with it....of course we all nod our heads off. O:-) but them my mom calls at 12:30...bleh and gunter decided to leave because he has to drop by relay for life again. I don't think he made it though.....he looked pretty tired....really tired. Hope he's not dead in his car because he fell asleep at the wheel....kidding...he's fine....i think. Anyway happy birthday to everyone in the coming year...I suck at dates so don't expect me to remember. Really. Ok bye. have fun
