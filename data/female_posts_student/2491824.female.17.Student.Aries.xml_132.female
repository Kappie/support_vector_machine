The whole kitchen reeks of sour cream and onions now.   I signed up for a Gmail email account. Spiffy, huh? You could email me there. (AshyAsh--at--gmail.com) My inbox there looks awfully lonely.   I'm taking the SAT tomorrow. I'm actually looking forward to it. I've always been very good at standardized tests.   I got my digital camera on Monday. It's nice. I like it.  I might post some pics of my art when I get some of my recent favorites back from my art teacher--they're hanging on the bulletin board in her classroom.   I'm bored. No one is online.  No One .
