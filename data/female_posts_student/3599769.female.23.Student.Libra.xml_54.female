This week already has been such a trying week. Happy to say I'm still here.  So I found out that he is talking to someone new. I just asked him, told him I wanted to hear the truth from him. He said yes, but not like how I think. Whatever, what am I supposed to think. So somehow him actually admitting to this put things in a little more prespective. I don't know why, I guess I just wanted him to say it so I can stop deeming him a liar. He then preceeded to tell me that I was the most important person in his life, but that he wasn't the right one for me. Thanks. For some odd reason I thought that was my decision to make. So thats it. For now, why lie? I have not called him or anything since that convo. And he was the one to call me in the first place, he wanted to show me his new toy.  So I guess everything comes to an end. And somehow I don't feel all that rotten. I  still hurt, but I think the fact that he has told me the truth somehow let me me mourn in a different way. I have no hope left for us. I just know that someday he will think of me. I will try and distance myself as much as possible but I am weak so I know I will succumb sooner or later. Hopefully way later.  As for blogging, it seems to be my highlight everyday. Well, reading others that is. I always want to post but then I just don't do it. I guess I felt like I was whining too much and the masses where gonna come and tell me to quit being a baby already. But I'm throwing those thoughts out. If I need to vent I will. Off to start a new and somewhat better me. I know that I am capable and worthy of having a love so strong that it could withhold anything. I just need to stop pushing and stop looking.   Whatever, I'm just glad that I am making it one day at a time.
