Boring art,math, tech (new partner= Sam), English even pretty boring.  Lab group in Bio= Mike/Jamie/moi.  ugh.  History=boring too.  OK, I guess it wasn't really all that lovely.  Other hopefully better highlights of my life include  Leah forgot her "glasses" at my house  I am wearing my lovely white Dr. Scholl's sandals which are so much cooler than my three driver's manuel books  I have $131 to spend on whatever I wish  I want warmth outside so bad  got a pretty bracelet  watched myself smack my head against the cedar chest on Christmas '89 50,000 times for everyone to laugh at, including myself  Got some cool stuff for my French par-tay  ok, sorry but sick of typing, maybe I'll try again later
