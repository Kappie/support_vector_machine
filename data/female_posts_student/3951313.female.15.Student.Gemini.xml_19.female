I'm safe in his arms  yet you look at me like that  And I yearn to be in your arms instead   He kisses me and you turn away  You can't bear to watch,  the pain is too much  But I try and ignore this and kiss him back   why does God tempt me so?  I wish I could break away from him  And kiss you instead, you stand off,  but I wish you'd come near  I can't this torture anymore
