I spent most of the beautiful sunny weekend outside. It was great. Two long bike rides and a 10km run.  I'm really struggling inside. Externally things look okay but I'm bursting to cry. I spent the whole weekend by myself. While that in itself is not the worst thing possible. I'm just lonely. And the friend who has been there for me through all of this (lets call him George) is still there and he still wants to take things further. But I just can't. I don't feel for him that way BUT it is so easy to fall into because right now that is what I am craving-someone to care for me. But he couldn't be further away from where I am.  I hate that my heart is still tangled up, cause where my heart is my mind dutifully follows. So things are pretty tough right now during the quiet times that enviatably come. I hope that it gets better soon.
