I did the 2000,2001,2002,2003 practices and I scored 10,10,9,9 respectively. And this year, MY REAL THING? I reckon an 8/10. WTF. This is not good. Everyone's able to let LC pull their grades up, as for me, this is wayyyy below mediocre. It simply SUCKS. But it's done. So why am I even complaining? Ahh.  Complaining about a not well done examination is like complaining about the weather, you can't really do anything about it. Can you?  Anyway, I watched the Czech Rep and Greece match the day before my lit exam, which left me feeling really lethargic the next day. Hahah.. That was the first match I watched for the Euro2004. I supported Czech, and it lost. Urgh. Owell, football/ soccer is a waste of time. A few ants-sized man running around on a mousepad-sized field kicking a termite's head. Fun? You bet [yea literally].
