Let's just say I'm looking for some CDs and just can't find them and am currently contemplating on whether to  a) Get it online? b) Get someone to buy it for me? c) Con people to buy it for me? d) Try to forget about it and use the money to buy a bunch of seamonkeys.  It's no wonder I've realized the increase amounts of white strands of hair in my head.   With these kinda decisions to fumble about on a daily basis; It's no wonder why we're all aging faster than we're suppose to, dying of heart attacks, suffering from anxiety attacks and quite frankly being lifeless limps by the time we hit 40.  Oh shit. I needed to get Bjork's Mendula as well.  Dammit. That's like 6 fucking CDs on the 'TO BUY' list. And I've not even bothered looking at the books "TO BUY" list.  I need a new handbag too. And some new pair of really cool Gravis sneakers.  Stress, stress, stress.  PS: I had my braces tightened yesterday. I may sound like I'm exaggerating but I assure you that I am not; THE PAIN IS JUST SUICIDAL. :( *Think Ashley Judd's teeth, Think Ashley Judd's teeth, Think ASHLEY JUDD'S TEETH*
