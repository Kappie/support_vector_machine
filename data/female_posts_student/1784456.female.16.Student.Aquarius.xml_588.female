Eww my mum's force-feeding me strepsils. What are strepsils supposed taste of? They kinda taste like a mixture of liquerice, (cant spell) stuffing, toothpaste and that horrible pink stuff that you have to wash your mouth out with when you go to the dentist. There's a vague taste of orange in there somewhere...
