Sunny and chilly How are you? I'm kind of sick, but all right, I guess Get motion sickness? Sometimes... I can't read in moving vehicles. Have a bad habit? Yep Like to drive? Actually, no. I'm always afraid I'll kill someone.  f a v o u r i t e s  TV shows: I don't watch TV, but I really used to like  Growing Pains  and  The Wonder Years  and  That 70's Show ...?

Non-alcoholic drink: Cafe Mochas Alcoholic drink: Martini or Mudslides (Friday's are pretty good...) Thing to do on the weekend: Sleep  h a v e  y o u  Broken the law: I'm sure Ran away from home: Technically, yes, but it was only to attend a band rehearsal that I was required to go to so as to prevent getting in total trouble with the colorguard instructor, and it was only because my mom and I were in a senseless argument.

It's a hate and hate relationship.   Been in love: I'm not really sure. Define love?

Nearly any shade of blue. Prussian blue is interesting.  What makes you happy: Coffee, and chocolate sometimes, even though right now I feel like neither; music, most of the time.  What makes you happiest: I suppose God, when I'm near him, but lately that's not too often...  What's the next CD you're gonna get: I don't know... Incubus's new one is compelling  w h e n / w h a t  w a s  t h e  l a s t  Time you cried: A few nights ago, I think... was it that long? Time you got a real letter: A real one? Uhm...
