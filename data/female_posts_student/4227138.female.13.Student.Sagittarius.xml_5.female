It was somewhat fun today because we have Josh Burke, Chris Bowman, Matt P. and Nate Toby (yep.. heir to the Toby Tours, I ain't kidding..) in our class... they make everything goofy. I just might have fun this year. I think we still have the 8th grade banquet.. yay! My first form of a "dance" or "formal" I guess. I've never heard much about it, I'm just excited because our school doesnt allow dances. (except for the 11th and 12th grade banquet.. which is a prom sorta thing)    I need to go now.. mother needs the phone.. I shall update in a while, though.
