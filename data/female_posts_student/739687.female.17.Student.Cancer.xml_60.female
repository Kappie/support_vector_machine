Haha. Anyways, I want to go shopping today. I need to go to Best Buy and pick up some CD's. And I need to find a book store and get a few books too. I think I'm going to edit my settings now, because I want more posts per page. And maybe I should change my Archive settings too...we shall see. Adios!
