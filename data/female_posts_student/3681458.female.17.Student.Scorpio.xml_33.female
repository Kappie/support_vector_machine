He's already like my boyfriend, I almost just don't want the label. I think I'm scared of the label. Only because that's what Ben used me for. At the same time I wouldn't mind saying that I did have a boyfriend, that he was twentyone and in college. I think I move too fast. I really am timid in getting what I want. He is what I want, I just don't want to get hurt again. I'm afraid of being used. I know he cares for me.   I miss kissing Ben and saying I love you afterwards. Gosh, I miss that. I truly meant it too. I did with all my boyfriends. I loved each one in some form or fashion. Sometimes I wish I could just say it and mean it. Almost like I want to snap my fingers and love Jason. I care about him, but I'm not in love. I could see myself falling in love though somewhere down the road.   Apparently Jennifer thinks I'm psychotic. Funny since she's the one who spent a week in a hospital for her unstable mind. Hah. Interesting diagnosis from her. I don't mind that Ben trys to make me out as bad, especially since my friends already have a heads up. Everyone he's talked to already know the story, and keep coming to me and telling me what he says. I like it that way. Not that I really care, but everyone feels the need to tell me what's going on. I appreciate it and feel like my friends truly care about me.
