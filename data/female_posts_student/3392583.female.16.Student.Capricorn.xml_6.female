When i was two, my mom was caramelizing some sugar, which involves putting sugar in a pot, essentially, and melting it or something.  i was sitting in the kitchen playing, and my mom was moving the pot somewhere.  My mom has polio on her left arm, however, so it was quickly losing it's hold.  She spilled the stuff on the floor, and a bit of it (luckily, only a couple of drops) got on me.  So now i have this small scar on my left cheek that turns red under too much physical stress.  It's all very interesting...    Yeah, so We're just having fun pretty much right now.  And i am bored to death.  Goodbye.
