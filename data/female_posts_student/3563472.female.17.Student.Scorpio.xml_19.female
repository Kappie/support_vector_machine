It makes me wonder if the search for a soul mate is something everyone does/wants (so thelonging fora true lover is innate)or is that just because our society expects that. I'mthinking it's the latter because there are a lot of societies that don't marry for love. However, wanting a true love and trying to pursue a relationship are two very different things. If it's not expected in the society, people longing for true love are not likely to pursue it. I feel like I'm running in circles. I don't know. I'm bored.. I hate love songs.
