Danny wins second place. :)    THE ACOUSTICS REALLY ARE GREAT  okay so do you sing in the shower, or is it just me?  the thing is, i usually take it a step further. i dance in the shower.  seriously. please don't picture it.  stop it, it's horrible. i can't sing, i can't dance, and it's even worse when i'm naked. (unless i forget to take my clothes off before i get in the shower!)   CARELESS WHISPERS  tomorrow is the last day of the semester. i'm so happy that i will write a poem about this.   my poem:   dancing is best left to two naked left feet. jazz hands! you can let yourself go, listen to the beat. duran duran!  the tunes of the eighties are close to my heart. kajagoogoo! when you saw heart, you knew the rhyme would be fart. roll call!  now you know why i won ten thousand dollars. ten syllables! destiny's child likes to sing, ladies ladies ballers ballers. bugaboo!   robert frost, eat your heart out.
