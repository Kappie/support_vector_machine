It wasn't very exciting, but the whole situation was bizarre.  I really like Martin Sexton. He makes me hot and his falsetto is super sexy! Great guy he is.  Moving on, there is person named Mike that told me he knew Caleb. Caleb knew nothing of Mike. Mike is a philosopher, and he's probably my soul mate. A lot of people are my soul mates.I found this whole scenario kind of strange. Maybe I imagined this Mike character up because I wanted to meet a philosopher that day. I did meet him July 3rd at Jazz Festival. I like this.  James and Donald threw a party for James' dog's birthday. Strange? I found it very amusing either way. Donald brought his dog and cat to the party. I wanted to go but i don't know how my animals would react with other animals. I should've taken a cow.  "You know I don't like the way I am. You know I don't like the way I am. Oh no." -- Martin Sexton  "Cowboys are pretty cool. Pirates are pretty cool. If a cowboy and a pirate got together, their offspring would be super cool"--Caleb
