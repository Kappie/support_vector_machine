Geoffrey Studdert Kennedy    "God loves us the way we are but He loves us too much to leave us that way."  -Leighton Ford    "You can operate your business without Christ. You can make it run well. You can raise your family without Christ. You can even pastor a church without Christ. But if you do, you will find that there will be no fruit, no Christlikeness, no manifestation of that beautiful character which arrests the attention of others. Instead there will be a sham, a phony imitation of the real thing, which will drive people away from Christ and will produce nothing but a dull, mechanical religiosity."  -Ray C. Stedman
