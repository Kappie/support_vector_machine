Then I will strategically slip out the office window, and land gracefully on the lawn outside. Then stealthily hijack (hyjack?) the eggmobile and drive to Mexico. Occasionally stopping for bathroom breaks and perhaps a Frappuccino or two. Then when I get to Mexico I will use my insane Spanish skills and open a restaurant called "Bailando Frida's" ("Dancing Frida's" for all those non-spanish speakers out there.) I will become an instant success and live happily ever after in a huge house with Ricardo, the latino waiter who I started my business with, forever free of boredom.
