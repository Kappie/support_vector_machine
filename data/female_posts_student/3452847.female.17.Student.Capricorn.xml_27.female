And after 3 weeks and she thinks things are just great, i wish i could tell her as i feel sorry for her now. I do feel bad now, not about what happened, but about how she seems to be getting too caught on to him and shes going to get hurt. Its so hard when people talk about it, i can't comment can i? He needs to be told to do it, tell her. I might have to say something to him, get him to do it. I need to wait to calm down, its not the right time and none of mine...  I feel so rough at the moment, this is not doing me any good for my cough and run downness.  ~Lisa~
