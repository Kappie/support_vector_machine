It was so great to see them again... and it was interesting talking to them about what all's going on with me.  They were asking what my plans are after graduation... I told them I'd do one of 3 things... A) Live and work here in San Antonio, B) Live and work in Austin (or a city of very close proximity), or C) Live and work in a suburb of Houston (like Spring, TX, where they are going to live)... my reasoning for living in Austin or outside Houston would be to be closer to them.  I mean, I wanna be able to have the same type of relationship with them as my Dad and Mom do with my Uncle Scott.  And it wouldn't be the same between my parents and uncle if he didn't live here in San Antonio.  Of course, Kathy pointed out something very important... it will totally depend on whether or not I'm attached to someone at the time of my graduation.  She then asked if I was dating anyone.  And I told her she asked at an awkward time... being that I was just asked out the night before for an indefinite time in the summer by someone who I had formerly been EXTREMELY attracted to, and thought of asking out myself... but then fell out of attraction to... and then back into attraction to.  Long story... long and complicated... but yet simple.  ;)  Anyhow, she was like, "Well, date him, and bring him to Houston so we can check him out...!"  haha  She's so funny!  I'm really glad I ended up having an awesome sister-in-law!  So, they stayed here til about 6:30 last night... my apologies to Melissa and her family, as I didn't realize that they'd be in town that late.  I thought they were going to be outta here by like, 2-3pm... and that I could make it to dinner.  Then my parents, evil as they are, guilt-tripped me into helping them clean some stuff up in the backyard... one of those things was my dog... and giving an extra hand in clipping her nails.  That is a major task... anyone who knows my dog knows that she's incredibly hyper... and well, she can't sit still for too long when she's with someone.  So, it's a huge task to get her to sit still long enough to clip her nails... w/o clipping them too short and causing her to bleed all over.  Which, unfortunately, is why my Dad no longer helps clip her nails... he clipped one too short once, and still feels bad for it.  Of course, my dog soaked up all the attention she could get from him being guilty... I swear, she only limped around my Dad in an effort to make him feel VERY badly.  Anyhow, that's how my Memorial Day was spent.  I don't have anything to do this week, but next week I have to go to the office on Tuesday.  Then I don't have anything to do til the following Monday.  In which I will see MANY people from work.  Should be interesting.  Unfortunately, Steve will not be at any training stuff... because he won't be working with ASK next schoolyear, and doesn't need to train.  :-(  Oh well... I'll see him around outside of work.  He is, however, working summer camp @ Thornton.  Ya know, it hit me the other day... he will have been the first guy I've dated since Eric that has been YOUNGER than me.  HAHA  He's about 1-1/2 years younger, actually.  Well, anyhow, I need to play some music and feel better... so I'm gonna go play guitar a bit.  :-)  Last night was the first time I'd picked up my guitar in about a month... I missed it so much...!  Surprisingly, I am still doing quite well... and my fingers didn't hurt a lot when I was done playing for about an hour.  COOL!
