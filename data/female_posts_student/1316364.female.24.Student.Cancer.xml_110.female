Earlier this week I received a package from Jesse containing a brand new laptop for my birthday. This actually wasn’t the highlight of my week though. The highlight of my week was finding out that Jesse would be able to come home on RR before the end of the year. We are not to sure of the exact dates yet and I am positively sure that I probably will never know the exact dates until I get a phone call from Jesse at the airport stating he is home and to come pick him up. Even now thinking about this makes me smile from ear to ear. It will do us both some good to be able to see each other, even if it’s only for 15 days because 15 days is better then nothing and I will take anything they (the ARMY) will give me.   I am currently working on sending another care package. So far I have a few things from his mom (a couple of computing magazines, a book and some Gatorade) I have put some candy and am currently waiting for some books to come in the mail to include. I purchased a complete series of Sci Fi books for him, which I am going to tell him to hold onto because after he is done I would like to read them. I also am going to put in a tiny keepsake I got when I went to Knottsberry Farm, it is something he can wear close to his heart and I know he will like it. My mom told me to let her know when I was ready to send my package because she wanted to bake some more for Jesse. So this next box is going to be filled to the rim with yummies and goodies for him.  In other news, my tattoo is healing up real nice. I am very happy with the way it turned out, and despite a few objections from my mom stating she felt it was too big, I am very happy with it, and that is all that really matters. School will be starting in a few weeks and I cant wait for that either, I am really looking forward to going back and it will defiantly help me pass my time away.  I feel like the FRG has pretty much dissolved which is very sad but I guess all you can do is be there for each other even in time when you aren’t needed. I am slowly getting through the next issue of the Signal Salute but I know it will be just as good as the first one. I still haven’t gotten anyone to volunteer to help out which is sort of disappointing but then again, I don’t really blame any of them, I don’t really want to do it either, but it’s the only thing linking me to the rest of the FRG and I will keep it going for as long as I have too.   Its just so sad.
