No matter what you do or say fear is a shadow behind u. that was a random thot Anyways another random thought. Over the yrs i have learned that people always tell u to think ahead and think of the future. Me on the other hand i think U shud never think of whats ahead in the future. coz i've learned that not everyone gets to live or be in the future and the things u imagine u cud one day do will prolly never happen and then u come crashing down. The future u plan is never the future ure gonna get. So stop wasting ure damn time.
