Yes I lived even though I live in the Bronx and 2 ppl just got shot 2min from my flat. Damn had a minor panick attack myself, whats wrong with the world?? New B tried comforting making fun of me, think it was the whole idea that it was my turn next... The two bastards who did it is still at lose- Yes, guess where they dumeped their get-away-car?!?! yep, thats right next to my street. How totally fucked is that?!?! Well still no prospect of actually meeting New B yet, he's still busy with his store... When I finally got to bed I couldnt sleep... Note to self- you live on 4th floor, what are the odds someone will come in your sleep, rape, murder and what-not to ya?? - Stop worrying FFS!     Thursday  Celebrations have set in... yey at me for getting old :) Had a group meeting in the morning, was of course v. late... Quite an accomplishment turning of ur alarm in ur sleep so it doesnt go off :( After group meeting Yndi Guggu and I went for a bagel and laid in a nice parc tanning, and discussing all sorts of things... fabulous sunshine-- And am actually getting brownish ;) Talked to Christian when got home and decided that we should have a little date, so he rushed over round 8pm so we could watch Paradise Hotel.. or something! Well turned out to be a loooooong nice evening... you get my drift ;) Drank some wine, ended doing v. crazy things... (trust me its not to know...) But will tell that I helle 4yrs old dared him to do push-ups... 14 way to go sweets- Taking into consideration you had been using your stamina for other more important things ;) Of course I couldn't be a sissy, so had to prove that was nothing, ended up doing... hmmm too many! Well after 5-6 hours of fun it was time to sleep... and Christian decided to be a gentleman and move my wine-covered table... yesh i managed to knock over a bottle of wine, 2 FULL wine glasses and god knows what... my carpet is still red.. smooooth as usual, i am!! :) ...Anywho, so while he moves this table, he sorta loses his balance, and the show he put on there was the funniest thing I ever seen! He steps on bed, almost falls over, so step up on couch, turn around still no balance at all and table with stuff on his hands, manage to finally get down on floor and put table down. Take a bow sweetie, nothing fell off table and he didnt fall over...  Spooned and snuggled all night- except for when i woke up from PAIN in my arms... grrr never doing push-ups again--- 4 asprins and 10 hous later, it still hurts!!!! Damn it!   How stupid can u be? And who said exercise was     good for you!!
