All of them glitter as hopeful possibility on the road towards perfection To these highly capable creatures who are Fully talented, grateful, and aware that To whom much is given, much is expected. To observant mudphud enthusiasts, and there are many, This species of soul has never been observed Actually performing its required task of self-directed studying But the mudphuds are a secretive sort Who could never understand why learning is so easy for them, only that it is And that they love it, and they don’t care what judgment others pass of their own individualized education. In the mudphuds natural habitat of the library, a coffeeshop, or highly personalized personal abode, One may observe a range of mudphud dialogue, from intellectual procrastination to uberproductive idea exchange to regressive but necessary childish antics Wary of what is revealed and what is concealed about themselves Presented with interesting situations or options, in any sphere of life, they have never been observed to say No I can’t or No I don’t want to And they are never lying when they do this. Because somewhere inside there is a little spark for everything in the mudphud, and  They naturally want to build a fire for every spark of potential that they have. Some are so fascinated by the multitude of sparks they don’t know which fire to kindle first Others kindle flames as they come, seek the warmth of the blaze, and then move to the next, leaving the first one behind, Yet others take a middle path. Mudphuds as a species will always question themselves But perhaps all they really need to learn is that setting limits, making difficult and honest choices, does not suggest incapability, but strength of character In the end, deep down, these animals trust mostly themselves, and by the magic of intuition, Know exactly what they are all about and what they need to do.
