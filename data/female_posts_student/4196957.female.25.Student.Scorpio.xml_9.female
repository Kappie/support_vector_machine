Apparently, John Kerry and his psychotic sidekicks are seeking to prove they can get away with lies more effectively than the last Democratic presidential candidate. It seems Kerry would have shied away from the lies after his "Christmas in Cambodia" experience, a story he has told 50 times and an experience that was "seared" into his memory, was proven to be untrue this past week. That was a big one. Anyway, today in response to the Bush campaign's criticism of Kerry's absence during important votes concerning intelligence, the Kerry campaign replied saying Kerry had once served as Vice-Chairman of the Intelligence committee. It seems that Kerry's folks need to check their facts. Kerry did at one time serve in that capacity, but it wasn't John Kerry; Bob Kerry did, however, do a splendid job as Vice-Chairman of the Intelligence committee. I certainly don't expect to see this anywhere but Fox.   Oh, and this just in from abcnews.com:       As his plane was flying from Oregon to Idaho on Saturday, Kerry defended his taste in sports, saying, "The guys who do it are all local guys -- plumbers, construction workers." Asked if these regular folks fly from one state to another, the husband of the condiment heiress downplayed the cost, saying, "What? 250 bucks for a ticket?" Luckily for Kerry, the moment was not on camera. But it was the kind of moment -- if captured on camera -- that could undo months of work.       This guy is trying waaaaay too hard.  Not much else going on in Alisonville, just the obsessing over politics. After all, I think I was the only kid in the 4th grade who not only watched every moment of both conventions on TV during the election of 1988, but also kept a scrapbook of political cartoons and political ads from the election. of course, I was also the kid who chose to buy a set of old campaign buttons at the LBJ library in Austin instead of going for some other fun souvenir. I really love election years. My blood pressure goes up and down and I feel like I'm getting a workout without ever setting foot in a gym. Must remind myself that sitting on the couch watching election coverage will not improve physical fitness. I think this will be a fun campaign for a lot of reasons. First of all, it's pretty tight right now. It's a heated race and those are the most fun. Also, we have the down-to-earth Texan on the Republican ticket and uptight and overpolished Mr. Heinz Kerry on the Democratic ticket. We're just warming up and I can't wait. :-)
