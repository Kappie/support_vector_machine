Maybe I'm just nervous about my exam today.  In less than 2 hours, I'm going to be practice clicking my way through 350 multiple choice questions.  Not much creativity there.  My right brain is getting its last hurrah before succumbing to overviewing information and looking at diagrams.  My left brain is dead.  2+2 = my kidneys don't work anymore.
