You have a way, of making me feel small Of not thinking what you want me to think The flesh that you had hurt is still feeling raw  Why do you like making me run about? You won't let me out from you sight Don't make small things seem loud You always make me oblige Always make me oblige  Everyone has their rights but I don't have mine Let me tell you that this is not kind Not meaning to make rude wors rhyme  You have a way of making me feel small Of not thinking what you want me to think The flesh that you had hurt is still feeling raw  Why do you like making me run about? You won't let me out from your sight Don't make small things seem loud You always make me oblige Always make me oblige    Written by Drifting Heart
