Anyway, so it was the beginning of the game and Frank Thomas goes up to bat, the legend of the team, and this guy behind us yells, "Take him out!  He's too old to swing!"  Yeah I was pretty pissed... he struck out.  Then, the next time he was up to bat, he hit a homerun, got two runs scored in.  I wanted to laugh in that dudes face, but ya know...  The Mariners just plain suck this year, seriously.  It's like they don't even want to play anymore.  I'm just happy cuz I got to drive.  Anyway, I'm tired and I have a headache, so I'm out. later dayz
