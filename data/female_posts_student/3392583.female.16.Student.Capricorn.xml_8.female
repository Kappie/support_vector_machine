If I haven't worked, either at my aunt's coffee shop or at my mom's new crackhead building, my energy level becomes either apallingly high, or appallingly low.  And when it's high, I begin to do terribly foolish things, such as dance around like a fool in my bedroom, scantily clad and throwing punches and kicks (rather flimsy ones) all over the place.  I recorded this once just to make fun of myself, and yes, it does look like I'm having seisures.  It's amusing, but I absolutely refuse to subject anyone to such horrible... um... yeah.  Hey, if anyone's reading this, put a comment up.  About anything.  Philosophy is preferable.  I love debating about philosophy.  Not that I know much about it, but thinking about it is a human thing.  We all have our philosophies.  It's just that people forget that it is philosophy, not all religion.  Meh. Bye.
