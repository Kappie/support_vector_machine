This caused me to try to turn my boombox off by changing the station, volume, and unplugging it. Then I rememeber thinking to myself, "Oh, it is my phone." Yes, my alarm clock was going off on my phone. I turned it off without even considering the need to wake up and went back to sleep.  I woke up at 8:10AM, thought about staying home, remembered the freshmen orientation, and began walking. My brother Billy ended up seeing me and gave me a ride. Thankfully.    Random side note: My foot is very asleep...as usual     School   English: missed it Contemporary American Issues: Made a poster Precalculus: Same story as last class - slept Spanish: Listened to review group ramble on senselessly Chemistry: Brought Marie her juice and caught a glimpse of the freshmen of whom I would be a reigning senior. Mu hu ha ha ha History: Was being a robotier for the freshmen  Came home and got a call. I forgot about hiking. I got dressed and we headed out. Quick hike, all good. I am still very sore from the sit-ups. Time that I do more soon though. I feel badly.  Came home, talked to my favorite person, and told my dad that I was doing so. :-D  Now I keep thinking about the same issue. This issue being wanting to say something, but being unsure of how good of an idea it is. It is something I am lax about with friends. With some friends it is true, such as Britt, Marie, and Rils. I will not say what it is here because that would contradict this paragraph. However, I do not wish to be lax with it, because I want this person to know that I am very serious, and what I am saying is very true.   Arg, I will probably slip up and say it one of these days. I have already come very close to doing it.   I am so glad that Tycho and I have gotten so close. It makes me feel so incredibly good. Well, hence my recently prior hesitations.   Well, none of that is making it obvious. Oh well. lol  It still feels like 70Â°F. Tomorrow it is supposed to get up to the 90s. Good hiking weather. I intend to take a very long walk, and maybe try running some. More of a workout.  I know there was more that I wished to post. Oops, y'all get off easy tonight, so please have a good one.  -J9  Song related to thoughts for the night (And I love singing Sarah McLachlan and her lyrics are always so deep. This is one of my favorites besides Angel and Building a Mystery)Bold parts are the big hitters.    I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  Remember all the good times that we had Let them slip away from us when things got bad Clearly I first saw you, smiling in the sun  I want to feel your warmth upon me, I want to be the one   I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories   I'm so tired,I can't sleep Standin' on the edge of something much too deep It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word We are screaming inside, we can't be heard    I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose  Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night Gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light   And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Weep not for the memories    -I Will Remember You
