But I'll be nice and, just like everyone else does, say: Nothing, what's up with you?   What were you New Year's resolutions for 2002?  You didn't answer my question.   *muffled 'bitch'* Oh, nothing. Now, What were your New Year's resolutions for 2002?  I didn't make any.   Did you follow through with these resolutions?  Yes, every single one of them.   I'm proud of you.  Really?   No. What were the best movies you saw this year?  The Matrix for the thousandth time, Memento, Donnie Darko, The Mothman Prophecies, XXX, 8mile, The New Guy, and A.I. (despite the fact that everyone else hated it.)   What was the worst movie you saw this year?  Jason X, hands down. *soggy, soggy*   What was the best song of the year?  Hailie's Song by Eminem, If I Can Go by Angie Martinez feat. Lil Mo and Zicario, Roll Out by Ludacris, The Whole World by Outkast, and I Know What You Want by Busta Rhymes and Mariah Carey.   What were the best resurrected songs you heard this year?  Have You Ever by Brandy, Don't Wanna Miss a Thing by Aerosmith, Motown Philly by Boyz II Men, and Always Be My Baby by Mariah Carey.   What was the worst song you heared this year?  Still Fly by Big Tymers. I love it anyway, though.   What was the stupidest thing you did all year?  Fell down the stairs when getting off Bomee's bus once, and spent the next half hour trying to laugh it off and making myself look even more stupid. It's a talent of mine.   What was the most stupidest thing anyone said to you all year?  "You're too young to be in love." ties with "Don't get your bellybutton pierced, you'll become infertile."   What was the best advice given to you this year?  "Be yourself."   What was the best thing you did for yourslef all year?  Hang around the Huntington Theatre, playwriting workshop and all. And trying my hardest to be nice to everyone.   Who are the most interesting people you've met this year?  All of them.   What was the worst month of 2002?  August.   What was the best month of 2002?  August. Long story. And...April...   What are your resolutions for 2003?  To improve my vocabulary, to trick the CIA into recruiting me, to join the football team my sophmore year, to get my hair cornrowed at least twice, to figure out a way to keep my single-rhinestoned-thumbnail "style" going, to learn judo and aikido, to get the damn  urlLink Manolo Blahnik boots  (they have them at Baker's and Steve Madden, definitely not as nice but at a hell of a more reasonable price), to be more outgoing, to trust my feelings more, and to keep at least two of these resolutions.   Happy New Year.  You too, sexy.
