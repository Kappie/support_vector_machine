It gets boring around here with just me and Abby.  But I think my Dante thing got that taken care of.  Go take the test.  I want to see where yall end up, especially Abby.  Anyway, I've got to go help my mom take a shower.  If anyone wants to come to my little sister's play, it's today at 6:00 at Brentwood UMC in the sanctuary.  It's about Jonah, and Whitty has a solo, so come see her!!!  She's really good.  Ok, that's it for me.  Bye-bye for now.
