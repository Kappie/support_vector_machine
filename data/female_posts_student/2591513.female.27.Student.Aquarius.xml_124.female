I am so sickened to know that there are actually barbaric people there that would be willing to do such horrendous and cowardly acts.  I am so sad for the families that have to endure with the pain and the knowledge that their loved one was beheaded in a lame attempt to prove something to the world.  You sick stupid bastards...it only shows how coward and how barbaric you are.  I am so sorry if this is a rather gloomy post, but I can't help but feel so much anger towards people who think that violence is the answer.  This was a senseless killing of a man.  I ache.  I can't help but think of my husband and the danger he faces by going back to the land of chaos, aka Iraq.  People there are willing to take his life and would even go as far as making him an example for the whole world...this scares me.  This really terrifies me.  This type of news is every family's worst nightmare.    My prayers go out to these poor families.  May God be with each and every one of them as He was with those poor victims during their ordeal.
