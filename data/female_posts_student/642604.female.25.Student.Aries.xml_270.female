Monday - Got in, mom and Caitlin picked me up at the airport, went home, hung out with my mom and with Nancy and rehearsed for the funeral.  Tuesday - Woke up, dropped off mom at the church, sat in rush hour traffic still at 10, got to Carteret to pop my head in for Joann's last day, said hello to everyone, left, went back to the house, hung out with mom, Nancy called, went to the funeral home to rehearse, got freaked out by the casket (closed thank god), tried to fix the high end synth the funeral home had, rehearsed, went back to the house, fell asleep, got ready and went back to the funeral home for the visitation and then for the funeral.  Sang my song, finished the funeral, went back to the house and talked to the many many people who came back.  Wednesday - Woke up, went to the gravesite, sat through the short ceremony at the burial site, went back to the house, ate brunch with the whole family, went to Murphys in Olde Towne Alexandria for St. Pattys Day, met up with Eric, walked the streets, drove Eric to his office, went home, napped, went to see Hildalgo with Lucky, came home, went to bed.  Thursday - Hung out with Jeff  Friday - Picked up cousin (Jen) at Papa's, took her to Lucky Brand and bought jeans with my discount, went to Foxes Music Co., went by Leigh's old house in Arlington, went to Long John Silvers, dropped Jen off, went to meet up with Leigh at Borders (HATE WHAT THEY DID TO BORDERS), went to Carteret, hung out with everyone, went to happy hour with Bobby, Meghan, Burt, Mike, Mike's friend, Pandy, Bobby's friend and Stacy.  Had a blast, left before most of them, went home, met up with Eric, went to Jess's, all three of us went to Freddie's in Crystal City to meet Eric's newest interest.  Listened to God Awful kareoke while drinking, went home, went to bed.  Saturday - Went to lunch with Joann, hung out with my mom, went to dinner with Dad and Sue, went home, hung out with Eric, went to bed.  Sunday - Woke up at the crack of dawn, get to Dulles, say goodbye to my mom, get in the wrong line, get in the right line, try to find my drivers license and realize that my purse is in my mom's car, find a pay phone, call mom's house collect, no answer, try to remember her cell phone number, can't, try to call my phone collect, call won't go through, ask one person for change, call my cell phone in my mom's car, no answer, ask another person for change, call my cell phone, mom picks up and said she had already turned around and was coming back, went outside to wait for her, in tears, wanting a cigarette, can't because they're in my purse, mom finally pulls up, get my purse, in tears say goodbye, go running back in, stand in check in line, get to the front and attendant tells me I have 5 minutes to check in, I tell her to check me in, tell her I have bags to check, says she can't check them, I very strongly (and by strongly I mean I let my temper get the best of me and most of you know how bad I can be when I let that happen) suggest she check my bags since I still have 5 minutes to check in, she checks them and gives me some pass to get through boarding but mentions that I will have to run and get my actual boarding pass at the gate, I go to the security line which is easily a good 150 people or more long, I ask the woman in the back to help me out since I don't have time to wait in the line, she basically tells me it's not her problem, she mentions maybe trying another checkpoint, I find a security guy at the front of the same line I was just at the back of (NO WAY I'M FINDING ANOTHER CHECKPOINT!) and sweetly ask him if there is anything he can do, he ushers me through the staff line which is only 5 people long, run to the shuttle, ride it to the terminal, run to the gate (fortunately right around the corner) and nicely ask the woman checking boarding passes at the door how I get my boarding pass, she gives it to me and I get on board.  Get back to Boston, call Back Bay Coach, get home, change into PJs and get into bed... haven't moved since... and all I keep thinking about is how much I don't want to be here and I almost wished I had missed my flight and had to stay another day... but instead I'm here.  I know I have to make the best of being here but I miss D.C. already and I haven't even been back 24 hours.  I just have to keep telling myself that May is right around the corner... and hopefully muddle through with the few friends I have here.
