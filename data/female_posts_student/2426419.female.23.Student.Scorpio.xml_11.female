There are many different ways, prayer, talking, listening, serving, etc.  But I also think it is important to  CHALLENGE  each other.  I know in school that I don't really learn anything unless I am challenged by it.  It makes me engage my mind to a level where I have to think and analyze.  If we don't challenge, then we aren't getting anywhere.  Do I make any sense?
