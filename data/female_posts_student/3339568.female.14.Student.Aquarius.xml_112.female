And sometimes things seem to fly by, then other times it goes so slowly. I'm confused about things (but then again when am i ever not?) I feel apart from God, i don't know why but I just do. Lord come close to me again. My friends seem differnet, some of them have just changed. People I think I know turn around and suddenly say things and do things that are entirley not them. And I don't know whats happened. Did I do somthing? How can things change so quickly? In a split second my life is different. And new friends. I never thought I would feel closer to them, people I have only known for a few months, than my friends I have known for years. I don't know if I feel accepted in the group. The guys seem to accept me, yes, the girls are close to it, but I dunno, there's just something there. I'm not totally in yet. Maybe it's just a girl thing. Hmmm..so many decisions I have to make. I mean what really is my life? It seems to fly by. New additions come and go as they please. Think back to my primary school days. What mattered? My hair, my friends, my schoolwork? I wasn't a Christian. God didn't matter. My friends, my best friend, Bianca. 2 years later and she's all gone. It's like she's a mist, she just floated away into the breeze but I can still sense her. We were going to be friends forever we said, we'd see each other every weekend. I haven't seen her in a year. I miss her. But I know things can never be the same. I drifted away from my Mimosa friends group to my Roseville group. I only just realised I feel close to half of my group at school. The others don't know me. They can never know me. And now Church, the Church group is getting stronger. I'm so close to being fully accepted I can smell it. I love it. I love God. I love Jesus. I love Church. I love evangelism. I love my friends. I have so many things. Yet I constantly want more. Is just a human fault or is it me? If I ever acheive what I want, will i be happy? Or will I forget about that thing and want more? So many questions, so little answers. I love him, or do I? Do I know what love is? Why are people so mean? The truth is so harsh, sheltering myself from finding it out from him will make what I know is inevitable less painful. People pronounce it, because they know my weaknessess and use it against me. They know what I fear most, and so they say it. They tease me with it. "Get over it Beth" or "He'll never love you Beth" or "You're worthless Beth" Am I? Do I believe it? Can I believe what people tell me? Who can I believe? No-one. Humans cannot be trusted. I can believe Jesus. But its so hard, I feel he's not always there. Everythings so hard. I have to evaluate some things and some people. How important are they to me? How important is my life to me? Sure its life and I have to accept it. But sometimes I just wish it was all over. I wish my final destination was reached and I could live in harmony with God in heaven for all of eternity.
