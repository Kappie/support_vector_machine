If our ancestors way back when had established different thought patterns, questions might not even exist today.  We might be severly behind where we are now, or very advanced. A positive/negative answer is an odd thing when  you really think about it. Or would we have questions no matter what? Sometimes there is no positive or negative answer, because there are too many variables. But questions are the essence of wondering and speculating, and people need to do that in order to move ahead. It's just that, when you have a question, you know which type of response the answer is going to be. "How does this work?" garners an explanation, while, "Is it raining?" can be answered with yes, no, or somewhere inbetween. Does this make questions a  needed  part of the language formula? I guess so.
