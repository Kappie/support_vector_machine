Probably going to do my stupid poetry assignments *ugh* hey em-ewww the SQUID yuck omg i totally was like about to faint when we had to disect that thing. The whole time Brandon was like 'dare ya to pick it up' ewww...like hell no lol.  But anyway...not much atall has been going on atall lately just watching Angel. I never really watch it but i just decided to. Ya know what...i think i've become a school bookworm this year...i care way too much about school..ppl even ask me to help them with hw! That is like waaaay freaky...That should never happen I mean last year i could care less about school...All i wanted to do was go to the movies,hang out with friends,or just do other stuff. No one here knows that tho.  I don't care tho...I should do school work and stuff but anyway I'm tired so im gonna go to sleep.
