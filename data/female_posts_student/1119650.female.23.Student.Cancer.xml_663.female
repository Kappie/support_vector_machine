You reap what you sew...go figure.  I'm going to get serious for one brief moment, and one moment only:  when I was younger I read books like  urlLink Song of Roland  and through studying other parts of Medieval and Middle history you realize how bloody the crusades are, but somehow they still seemed to have been a little romanticized.  Now, finding ourselves essentially in the midst of a new crusade its not as brave, noble or even as important as it may have seemed back then.  We may have buried the flag of Christianity under the guise of "anti-terrorism", but we're on the fast track to the same scenario.  This is not my stance either for or against the war (though I  do  support our troops and believe that if we couldn't help we woudln't be there) it was merely an observation.
