There is one girl  and two boys: Emma, Matthew, and Sean. They are so cute! Emma was bigger the the boys and she wuddnt stop sleeping, reguardless of her mothers telling her too (remindes me of me). Then the two boys were okay. Matthew was cute, he just sat there and watche TV in his little swing, but Sean, Jesus Christ the boy would no stop crying. But, when he was really bad, I felt really bad for him so I picked him up, and I don't know, did some instinctal thing and he stopped crying. It was like so cute... but I felt terrible for him cause they think he might be autistic. He did seem to have a very short attention span but, I felt terrible. This poor little baby, who should have such a long healthy life ahead of him, might not. Ya know? Any way, I need to cheer up. Peace xox
