In the book, it is Captain Marlow is assigned to employ Kurtz but in the movie its a little different. The captains name is Willard and he is sent on a mission to kill Kurtz. Also, the setting is somewhat both different and the same. It is different because it takes places in two different countries, Viet-nam and Africa. The settings are the same in the sense that they are both dark and have a sad feeling to them.
