DAmn! about 5 miles later the view was amazing. finished it off with chocolate fugde brownies and milk shakes and the closest gas station. So Much for losing weight! We're probably going to go to Boston one of these days. I rally want to. so we better go through with it. i wish i was in katy! if i click my heels three times will it work! i'm desperate enough to believe anything. Ate Mcdonalds today. i haven't eaten it in years.  YEARS  i tell you. but i was so hungry today i didn't give a a shit. so be it- if i die, at least i had food!! we're going kyacking tomorrow, and my bro adn me want to go mountain hiking again. AND garrett found a paint ball course near by- So maybe i can go there too! if not, there is one being built right around the corner from my house.  anyway.... 6 days...and i'll be out. Home. i'm so antsy. put me out of my misery.
