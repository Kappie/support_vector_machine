Lori drew a picture of me and Bob and I tried to draw a picture of her, but it turned out really bad!  I will deffinately be ripping that page out of my sketchbook!   After school was out for everyone Amanda came over and we tanned in my front yard for awhile!  You can actually see a little difference!  That makes me happy because I want to be dark, like a Mexican! Mark got yelled at for letting Paulina paint his nails so my dad made me take everyone home, it was sad!  I warned Mark that it was going to get my dad mad, but does anyone listen to me?  No!  Never! Once my mom got home from work me and Mark went over to Lori's house!  She made a grilled cheese sandamiches!  Yummie!  Then we sat in her room for awhile and watched tv!  After awhile people started to show up at Bob's house for the bonfire, so we went over there too!  A lot of people came . . . Lisa, Evan  girlfriend, Asian, Monica, Lani, Frank, Hank  girlfriend, Kam, Andy, CJ, Steve, Karina, and umm a lot of other people that I didn't know! I slept over at Jay's house because I couldn't sleep over at Lori's house!  Ummm, yeah . . . that is all that needs to be said about that!  I had to be out of his house by 4, so I picked up Lori and we went to Steak 'n Shake and then to Meijer!  WOO!
