Then I passed out on the couch for about two hours. I am still tired. I didn't get any sleep last night. Sucks. So most of my day was spent 'bonding' with my family. It wasn't too bad... i guess. I think I may like someone, but i am not too sure. I can't tell you who it is tho.. hah. So don't beg for me to tell you, cause it's not gunna happen!! I may go and see Shrek 2 again tomorrow.. hopefully. That is the best movie ever. But Shrek and Pheona should've stayed pretty, in my opinion. Cause I wouldn't like life too much if I was scaring ppl away. Well I hope that never happens to me, but you never know. I can't wait until I start cheering again. I miss it a lot... I'm a lil scared right now, I'm watching Ghost Ship, like alone. Here I go again, damn I'm lame. I need to make up a word... hmm.. *10 minutes later*.. No luck! Darn.. help me out here, plz. Ok well I am going to go to bed, I'm tired and I want to wake up early. peace.
