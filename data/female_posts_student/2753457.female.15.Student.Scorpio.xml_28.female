I called Time Warner on Friday, and they said they'd send someone over here today between 1 and 5, which means I had to stick around all afternoon.  Then, I get this message on our voice mail saying that they had to cancel the appointment and to call to set up another.  So, I called and yelled at them about it, but the only thing they did was apologize insincerely, and dare to ask, "How's Tuesday between 3 and 5?"  AHHHHHHH!  Yay for having strangers in my house after school with no one else home.  Argh.  Time Warner Cable needs to DIE. This has been the most boring weekend ever.  I couldn't go to see "Havana Nights" yesterday because I couldn't get a ride there, and I wouldn't have been back home in time to babysit.  So I got to stay home and watch old episodes of "The Inferno"; what an awful show that is.  It's amazing what sore losers these people can be.  Who even cares??  My aunt and uncle showed up early to pick me up to go to their house, which I wasn't a fan of.  I think that was the highlight of the weekend:  babysitting my dearest friend.  Ha, not.  Actually, she was fine.  She read me a book, and then we watched "Star Search" for a few minutes until I made her go to bed at 8:30.  Then I got to watch "Frequency" on ABC until 10.  Can you tell that they don't have cable?  My aunt way overpaid me, as always.  I'd feel bad if I wasn't so greedy.  I really needed the money though.  I always turn the neighbors down for babysitting--I cannot stand watching strange children.  Wait, babysitting definitely wasn't the highlight of yesterday; the real highlight was that I finally got some Garnier Fructis.  It smells really good.  I got to use some this morning. Oh, wonderful.  It just went down again.  Now I have to wait God knows how long to publish this.  Sorry if I was talking to you online just now!  Namely, Ashley and Chip.   That is so annoying.  I hate it with such a passion.  So, yeah, it could be hours until this post goes up.  HOURS.  I'm going to fold some laundry like a good little drone. Now I'm watching this crappy MTV movie.  Classic MTV movie formula.  The cameos, the special appearances by an MTV veejay, the sexual innuendos, both same-sex and different, the moderately attractive guy (in this case, the guy from "Camp"; he's a good singer), the dumbish girl who may or may not be a virgin, the smart and eclectic girl, the dork or two, and the whole style in general, a voice-over here, a still shot there.....you know it's gotta be MTV.  That movie "Election" is pretty funny.  Reese Witherspoon did a good job, and Matthew Broderick creeped me out in a way I never thought possible of him. My dad's gonna want to watch "The Simpsons" at 8.  I'll probably end up doing that.
