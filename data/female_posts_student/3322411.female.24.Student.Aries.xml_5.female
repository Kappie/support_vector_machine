Whether a person chooses to act in an irrational matter is in his or her hands, and they also have full control of what goes into their bodies.  Many individuals are fully aware of the consequences and effects of alcohol and drug abuse. What happens, though, when these individuals require a transplant? As it is, there is a shortage for organ transplantation, and we need to decide how to allocate these scarce resources. They chose to live a lifestyle that includes drugs and alcohol. I know if I were to donate my organs, I could not rest in peace knowing my organs went to a drug or alcohol user.     There are thousands of patients on the waiting lists to receive organ transplants. Many of these individuals die while waiting for that anticipated call letting them know they will be receiving their necessary organ. It is even worse when children have to wait for years to receive a transplant, cutting down the time they can be out having fun. I honestly wish we could prioritize who should be the first ones to receive transplants. I know that I would list drug and alcohol abusers at the very end. It is true that everyone is entitled to receive organ transplantation (even those individuals who are incarcerated). However, there should be some kind of limit as to whom receives these transplants. Why should an individual with a congenital defect be bypassed by someone who chose to abuse drugs or alcohol?     Sometimes those individuals who abuse drugs and alcohol are lucky. They have family members who are willing to donate their organ to save the life of a loved one. For instance, what if an alcoholic that received a new liver reverts back to his or her old ways and therefore will need another transplant? Alcohol and drug users have to understand that their lifestyle and behavior does not just affect them, it affects everyone around them. Individuals can promise they will not touch drugs or alcohol if they receive their transplant, but in some cases these individuals revert right back to their old ways. The medical profession increasingly will be faced with decisions about who should be allowed to donate organs and who should receive them. We should encourage people to come to the aid of a loved one who smokes or drinks or abuses other drugs, but not by endorsing irresponsible and dangerous behaviors.
