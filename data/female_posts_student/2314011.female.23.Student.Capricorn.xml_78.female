Just finished a 45-minute practice with the Double Diamond mix going throughout...so great.    The DVD player's clickiness stops when I let a CD play all the way through--even the burned CDs.  Interesting.  Squishy doesn't scream when she's ready to be emptied, but the steady stream of steam lets me know just as effectively.  The candle Mike gave me for Christmas last year burned its last flame tonight during said Yoga practice.  Thanks, little guy; you smelled great.  Another has taken its place on the top of the bookshelf.  It's introducing itself to Trudi right now.  Read the first 50 pages of A Civil Action earlier.  It felt cheap and dirty because I wasn't reading the book I've been craving ever since I began reading it, but it's time will come, if I ever get off this damn computer.  They went pretty fast, those pages.  Vaguely remember the movie, and can already say with absolute certainty that the book is better.  It's required reading for Civil Procedure, believe it or not.  Think I'll go add some sugar and milk to my Chai tea; it's one of my newest faves.  Tea!  Who knew?!
