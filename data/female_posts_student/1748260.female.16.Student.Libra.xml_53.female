Think my blog went mad or something..the past few days wasn't very good at home.. bein' blamed for my family dog which almost got missing.. ok shan't talk about it..new tagboard again.. many peeps complained that they can't see the previous one  it was damn laggy. Ok we acted the play for THE EDGE. Again what we heard was good comments  many laughters. Well thank God it turned out well.
