It was strange. It scared me. I just finished watching Psycho. I've always liked that movie. Norman. Whatta guy. But during the entire movie my eyes were fighting sleep. This is not like me.  I got about 4 hours of sleep last night and I was wide awake during the day. When I first got up, by my alarm to go jogging I was incredibly tired and I almost slept in again but I got up and went to the bathroom, praying that it was raining so I'd have an excuse to go back to bed, but it wasn't and I threw some shorts on and went outside. I was wide awake. Madness.  But now I'm tired. But I think the light of the computer is stimulating me or whatever becuase I feel way more awake than I did during my movie.  200 some people have taken my new quiz, 10 people have rated it and it's at like 4.70 or something. The most people that have rated, but my What Quizilla Annoyance Are You quiz has been taken more. I like that quiz.  I've been planning another quiz for a while and now that it's summer and I have loads of free time I'll be able to do it. I just have to plan it out then I'll get to it. My problem is pictures, they never seem to want to cooperate with me.   I got my report card today. These are my final grades for the year:  Semester One  CIS (Computer Information Systems): A World History II: A Gym/Driver's Ed: A --Driver's Ed Exam: A Biology: A  Semester Two  Algebra II: B English: A Latin II: A Computer Programming: A  I exempted all my exams last semster. I'm disappointed at my Algebra II grade. I thought I was going to get an A. I was kind of working hard to get all A's - it's the first final grade that's below an A since I started high school. I kind of you know...wanted to...have all A's...at least for half of high school. I know that's over-achieving and everything and loads of people would love to have my grades but I don't know. I've never had a talent for anything at all and I've always just made good grades so I thought I'd stick to that. I checked my GPA at the begining of the year and it was 4.3 something but I was ranked 8th in my class. One girl gets all A's and B's and was #50 something. My class is full of smart people. Whatever.  I think I'll go to bed way early today. It took me ages to fall asleep last night. Actually, I was in bed trying to sleep at 10:30 and my dad knocked on my door asking if I was awake and wanted to know if he could use my computer real quick, so of course I said yes. He was there a while so I couldn't sleep then but eventually at around 12:30ish I was in that half sleep where in one second I would be asleep but you know, someone wakes you up. My sister came in to tell me her friend was talking to her again. Oh gosh. I'm so glad she told me at 12:30. Geez. After that it didn't feel like I'd ever fall asleep but I did eventually and all.  Oh yeah. Today was a really weird day. Not only was I you know, in a good mood and all but I couldn't remember the morning. It didn't feel like I got up and ran at all. It's strange. I know I did but I don't remember. Maybe it was because I was half asleep when I did or something but whatever it was it's a creepy feeling. Like I was awake but I wasn't or something. I can't explain it. I don't like it though. I hope it doesn't happen tomorrow.   I think I just rambled a whole lot. I think I am half asleep. I don't sleep much, really, I'm always tired. I noticed when I was in front of the bathroom mirror today that it looks like I've been punched in the eye but I haven't. I'm just sleep deprived. I shouldn't really get up and run so early but I don't know. I like to.   My mom just came in and asked for something and I turned around kind of quick when she left and felt weird. My head's all fuzzy and stuff. I think I need a good sleep. I'll probably go to bed in a few minutes even though it's practically still light out.   I know I just rambled a whole lot on nothing. Oh gosh. I really am out of it. I just looked up and saw I already said that. What's wrong with me?     Music: No Love Lost - Joy Division
