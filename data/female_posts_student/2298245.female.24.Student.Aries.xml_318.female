But when I hit play, I have the image of the show, but the sound of whatever the tape previously contained.  So I cannot watch my show.  Or I suppose more accurately, I cannot listen to my show, though I can watch all the images and try to read lips.  But that doesn't sound like very much fun.  So now I'm in crisis mode, because I'm going to miss the new episode of The West Wing that is on tomorrow night.  I already missed the return of Tim Matheson, and now this.  I cannot take any more TV setbacks.  TV is my old standby.  This whole night class thing really sucks.  Okay, I'll stop feeling sorry for myself now.  I promise.
