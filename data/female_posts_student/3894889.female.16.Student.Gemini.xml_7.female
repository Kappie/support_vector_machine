Saturday, July 10, 2004 devo:  What no one ever saw or heard, what no one ever thought could happen, is the very thing God prepared for those who love him.   - 1 Corinthians 2:9 God Speaks Bible   In Beyond Ourselves, author Catherine Marshall tells about a problem she faced as a young person. She and her family lived in a small town in West Virginia that had undergone severe financial struggles in the aftermath of the 1929 stock-market crash. The two railroad shops, which were the only industry in town, were nearly shut down. Even with the promise of a small work scholarship and the $125 she had saved, Catherine was several hundred dollars short of what she needed to attend college.  One night her mother came to her room and found her sobbing. Her dreams of college seemed dashed. Her mother suggested that they bow together and ask for God's help. "Whenever we ask God for something that is His will, He hears us," her mother said. "If He hears us, then He grants the request we have made. So you and I can rest on that promise."   Soon, Catherine's mother was offered a job writing the history of their county. She made enough in this job to pay for Catherine's college expenses with a little to spare.   Do you have plans and goals for your life that seem impossible to achieve? Ask God to help. He will open doors of opportunity for you that you never imagined. He is committed to your success.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Well lets see i finally got my lawn mowed after talkin about it for 2 days. oh well atleast it got done before i had to leave.
