Sorrow sprung from open heart Her eyes reveal her long lost thoughts Smile to melt the blizzardest of hearts, Mine you have captured without a thought.  I hope you like this poem. It took me some time  to think of it, but i think it fits you just  nicely. Enjoy and smile whenever you see me, for  I only want to bring joy to your life, and never  sorrow.  Love, Ben  Thanks Ben, thats so sweet of you. Your poem brought a smile to my face, a light to my dreary day.  Saturday May 22, 2004 marked a full stop for me and doppio. He will no longer sms nor will he ever call. It is painful. Truly, it is. Hurts so bad. so bad. But he is bad for me. They are all the same. All they can ever say is sorry. "i'm sorry" What good does saying that do? Nothing.  I should never have answered that call on saturday. But now I know, That I mean nothing to him. Absolutely nothing.  Him:'You don't wana contact me anymore isit?' Me:'Ya' Him:'If I don't call you, you wont msg me anymore is it?' Me:'Yes' Him:'I was sick for the past few days, it's not true that i don't wana tell you wat's going on here. I'm coming back next friday. Dad ask me to stay longer. It was last minute. I called my boss to ask to extend my leave.' Me:'Ya ya whatever.You've lied to me too many times.I find it hard to trust anything you say.' Him:'I've bought the thing for you already.I hope to see you when I'm back to pass it to you.' Me:'Why did you call?' Him:'Just to see wats happening. why ur not replying to my msgs.' Me:'I'd tell you whats happening ok. If you even bothered, you'd have called yesterday when i didnt reply to your msgs and not now, 24hours later and proclaim that you care. You! cannot give me what I want. I feel that you treat me like dirt! and I don't need a guy who treats me like dirt. I'm so glad you are in london. I should never have answered this phonecall!' Him:'I'm sorry I disappointed you. I'm sorry.' Me:'Sorry for what? whats there to be sorry about?' Him:'Sorry for everything. I hope to see you when I'm back.' Me:'We'd see.'  Answering your call disturbed me a great deal. I should never have.  I should have hardened my heart when your name appeared on my mobile.
