I thought, finally someone who agrees with me! I've wanted a pulpit to preach from quite a few times. It's always about unity in the church.  It's so stupid to. I mean, why do I have to drive down University and see four or five churchs, and under their name is splayed "lutheran church" "Evangelical" "Methodist" I mean honestly. Doesn't it really all come down to a man dying on a cross, and coming back to life three days later to save the world? Isn't that CHRISTIANITY? So why the big hang up over denominations? "Ooo, I'm methodist, I can't talk to you southern baptist freaks." I mean seriously, who does that?  I have to admit I used to be in on it to. I kept asking my parents what I was, and I finally managed to get it out of my mom, "if you really want to label your beliefs, you're probably closest to a baptist" But that ended in like eighth grade. I mean, why should I have to label my faith? I'm already a Christian, is there more to it than that?  I know there are differences between denominations. but that shouldn't separate us. Hello? We're Christians, we are apart of one body. How can a body be separated? If my eye pops out of my head, turns around and says 'hey, I'm apart of Sara's Body, but I'm also separate from everything else here, I'm Saran but I'm an eyeish-saran' don't you think that's going to hurt me? Like me in my basic self is not good enough for my eye!  I think that's how Jesus must feel. We were all the same back in Palestine. Yea, they had issues and doctrinal questions over things like circumsision and kosher. But they didn't separate and go, 'I'm a galilean Christian, are you a Jerusaleman Christian?' The few times that they did that, and started talking about who they followed (apollo, paul) Someone turned yelled at them and they got right back into line. I think Jesus sometimes must be sitting up there looking at us fighting over stupid things that don't even matter, and I think he's saying something like *sigh* 'my children, I love them to death, but they can be so stupid! Don't they understand anything? I died for them so that they could be one with me, and one with eachother. Now they're screwing it up again over dumb things. Was my death not enough to hold them together? It's no wonder they aren't getting anything done! It's too bad they aren't like the Muslims who actually have their act together when it comes to unification. How can they expect to get anything done, if they're fighting all the time!? Hello???!!! I DIED FOR YOU! GET IT? THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. THAT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT!!! Now just try to stop fighting and see me again? Please?'  Because that's what we're doing. We're fighting over stupid things. And when we can't agree, when we can't stop fighting, how do you expect us to move and share Jesus with everyone else? It's impossible!  And there shouldn't be anything to fight about. We have to come back to the basics, because that is what got us here in the first place. We have to come back to Jesus. His death and his resurrection. Beyond that, nothing matters. Because beyond that, nothing gets you to heaven. Nothing keeps you out of hell. Nothing is worth living for. Worth dying for.  If we all believe that, why are we fighting?
