Anyway, the library is all cozy and nicely furnished, but i couldn't find the books i want. *bleh* Maybe i'm juz a lousy researcher...but i really couldn't find books on Haydn at all...or on Bach's Chromatic Fantasy  Fugue in D minor...could only find Schubert...Debussy also dun haf...thank goodness i haf already. Haha. Probably all borrowed out already. At City Hall MRT, this stooopid salesman harrassed me...say i very pretty blah blah blah...firstly, i read the newspapers and they haf of course warned us about these people. Secondly, if u think i'm pretty, i bet u also won't say right even if i ask u. Sorry man...such trick dun work on me. *smirk* Just read someone's blog just now and i must say it was quite terrifying...but it did set me thinking though...about life, purpose, circumstances...sighz...and i realise i'm in a very sad state concerning bgr lor...haha...dun worry, u r not alone (u know who i'm toking about). I'm like almost torn apart by not 1, but 2 guys lor...can u imagine liking two at the same time? It's kinda heart-wrenching...sigh...i really dun wanna let go of the first but the second...sighz...the second likes someone else and is crazy over someone else too...so i guess i haf no hope liao...HaiX...but i just can't forget...  Someone help me please?  The Reason - (3:52) I'm not a perfect person as many things I wish I didn't do but I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you and so I have to say before I go that I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me to change who I used to be a reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you it's something I must live with everyday and all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away and be the one who catches all your tears that's why I need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me to change who I used to be a reason to start over new and the reason is you and the reason is you and the reason is you and the reason is you  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you and so I have to say before I go that I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me to change who I used to be a reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show a side of me you didn't know a reason for all that I do and the reason is you
