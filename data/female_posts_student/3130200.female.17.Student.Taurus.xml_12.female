I wrote about my own friends in my personal journal after watching it and I think I'm going to enlighten...well, myself I guess because I'm pretty sure nobody reads this.  Oh well.    I had the best friends of my life at twelve years old.  Lauren, Sarah, and Mel were my everything...my life.  They were my world and I couldn't imagine it without them, until now.  I haven't talked to Mel since I move, but I haven't  really  talked to her since 7th grade or so.  Lauren moved the summer of 6th grade and we haven't spoken since.  Sarah and I are still friends, I consider her my best friend.  But I'm not going to lie to myself anymore...we've grown apart.  We had a lot of fun the four of us, probably more fun than most people can dream of.  We would laugh until we physically just couldn't bear to laugh anymore.  We would talk into the night about anything and everything.  We pounded chicken in Lauren's kitchen as we attempted to cook a "fancy" dinner.  We started a band called SLAMMS, never got around to booking a gig though.  We sang a song about 409 and needing just a little bit more of it.  We started a company in 6th grade to help everyone keep track of their class bucks and we even made credit cards.  Then, we became furious because the boys were copying our idea.  We played basketball and volleyball for the Pioneers, we didn't win much but that didn't matter. I didn't care that Lauren was richer than me, or that Melissa always got better test grades, or that Sarah was a better dancer.  All that mattered is that they could spend the night at my house on Friday and we could go to the movies together on Saturday.  It was that simple.  I remember once when Lauren said she didn't think her parents loved her we all thought that was dumb.  All parents love their kids.  As I look back though, her parents then remind me a lot of my parents now...distant.  She was right I think.  I worry about Lauren the most.  I really really hope she is doing ok...not sad.  I know Sarah is doing well and even without talking to Melissa in 5 or so years I know that she is doing well.  That's just who she is.  We're all going to do amazing things with our lives.  I'm sad that I won't be there to see them do these amazing things, to comfort them when they need it or to be there for them when bad things happen.  However, I am so thankful that these 3 girls were my first real friends...possibly my last real friends.  I owe them a lot but won't ever be able to repay them.  I hope that them knowing they will always always have a friend in me is enough.  Honestly, I am not sure we would have lasted through junior high and high school.  We were brought together for a reason and split up for another.  I-for one-am better because I knew them.
