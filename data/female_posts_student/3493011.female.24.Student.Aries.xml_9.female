No this is no good..I don't wanna have moments of happiness and all of a sudden THIS ! the negative vibes surrounding me... ERK.. I've told him how I feel.. there's nothing I can do..I can't juz turn this ard with a snap of my fingers neither is it juz solely my own effort of seeing this work... I don't wanna think of myself as perfect or even noble in any extent cos rite now.. I know I'm human too...I feel tired, desperate and dejected... I feel like crying now but I can't find the tears... where are they.. maybe after a good cry I'll feel better...   I juz wanna space out now.. juz wanna lie in bed and not think of anything...   I hope All Blacks kick ass tonite... but then again Johnny Wilkinson is sooo cute..he got great ass...
