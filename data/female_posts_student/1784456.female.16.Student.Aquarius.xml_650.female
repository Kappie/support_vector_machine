If she hadn't sat there Izzy and I could have had such a good argument.  Grrrrrrr.  So we are into the next round of the world cup.  I've been watching that guns and roses thing again.  It was the last one, because it was only a two part series.  Oh well I'll just have to go back to playing on the internet on wednesday night now then.  Right I'm going to go and play now.  O and I agree with all that you said about *Flob*  I hope that shes not clever enough to work out how to use our profiles.
