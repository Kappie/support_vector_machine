It's actually nighttime now..my usual posting time...dad's sleeping now. not a whole lot lately, although i did get new shoes today which made me super happy :D. my bed is pretty messy right now tho...so i'm gonna have to clean that off before bed. Tomorrow, i go shopping AGAIN...lol, but w/ a plan this time. i come home sunday...in 2 days? 3? somethin like that. i'm ready..i mean, i love my dad..but i miss home. i love flatland!..lol. although driving here is pretty fun, what with the curves and hills and all. good experience at least. i've been meeting new ppl online lately. my new friend is canada-nate. lol. he's pretty cool. but i guess that's the update for the past couple of days. damn, dad is pretty far gone...his snores could wake up the neighborhood (if we lived in a neighborhood ;)..)
