America's favorite neighbour, Fred Rogers, passed away Thrusday from stomach cancer at the ripe old age of 74.  He entertained generations of America's youth with trips on a trolley car to the  urlLink "Land of Make Believe"  and a smattering of  urlLink snappy cardigans and skippy sneakers.     Some interesting Mr. Rogers facts: For many years, Mr. Rogers mother knitted all of the sweaters worn on the program.  Mr. Rogers has worn over 25 different sweaters over the course of the program.  He was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania (the same place where Rolling Rock beer is born).  "Mr. Roger's neighbourhood" first aired in 1963 on the Canadian Brodasting Corporation  The final episode of Mister Roger's Neighbourhood aired in 2001, making it the longest running show ever.  In 2002 President George W. Bush awarded Fred the highest civillian honor, the Preidential Medal of Freedom, for his work with the well being of children.  R.I.P. Mister Rogers.
