NOW.  so i am on espn.com tennis results and every 5 minutes i like refresh the page because it shows the latest scores, that is so awful, i should NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW A STUPID TENNIS MATCH LIKE THIS NBC SHOULD JUST COME ON AND SHOW IT.  this is ridiculous, and you know what? jasper thinks so to. in fact he's meowing right now and its driving me crazy.   latest scores for s. williams and a. mauresmo: (one sec. i have to REFRESH THE STUPID PAGE!!!!!!!) 6-7 (4-7), 7-5, 4-4   ok the first number is Serena's scores and the second one is Amelie's   in case you didn't know
