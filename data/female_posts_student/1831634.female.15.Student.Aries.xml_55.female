[actually, her bro called... but same thing]  and I really really really really really really really wanted them to come over and play!  b/c I haven't seen meng-dahlin for the longest longest longest time!  and so I was sad like =(((((((((((((((.  and then jack FINALLY dragged his lazy butt online and told me to go over at three and leave at six.  ha!  what a joke.  anyways.  so it was still like 12:30 at that time.  so I decided to be PRODUCTIVE and I fiddled around with the script some.  and then I decided to make my OWN wildflower book cuz I'm too asian-cheap to go buy a copy of it.  so I was working and working and working [and not even reading a fic!] until I saw that it was 1:20!  so I had to hurry up and get dressed and brush my hair and yadda yadda.  then I get going.  oooooh boy.  NOT smart.  so I start out.  I wear my  blue shoes.  not v. smart.  anyways.  I have this PHOBIA of crossing streets at intersections... so.... yeah.  I had to MAKE SURE I didn't cross a street at an interection.  so I started out on hedgecoxe, crossed it, and then was about to cross coit, but then I saw an INTERSECTION.  so I said, "nah." and turned the corner onto coit.  then in the middle of the way btwn hedgecoxe and legacy, there was a lull in the traffic, and I crossed.  then cut across the tom thumb parking lot w/lotsa ppl looking at me funny.  then I fretted the entire walk from coit to independence about how I was gonna get across legacy.  -_____-;;  then I finally got across and cut across albertson's parking lot.  more ppl looking at me funny.  [teenager walking with a backpack during spring break?!  inconceivable!]  then I had to figure out how to cross independence...  and I did.  =)  and then I GOT LOST.  I GOT SO FREAKING LOST IT WASN'T EVEN FUNNY.  so I called kailing... not home.  called meng... not home.  called chuan... not home.  called ning... not home.  NO ONE COULD GET ONLINE AND TELL ME WHERE TO GO.  so I just wandered around for a while dumbly... then I somehow found my way.  whoohoo~  [dun ask why I didn't call jack.  cuz I dunno why.]  so then I got there at three!  right on time.  =)  and then he printed out the "book" that I sent him... haha.  and then we had to go to walmart and buy a memo pad... for 83 cents!  whoohoo.  then finally at 3:30, we went outside and started looking for flowers.  we walked along the bike trail by the creek for a while... and we found lots and lots of henbit.  lots.  and we dug some up and flattened it.  not very well, imho, but whatever.  and then we dug up some other random flowers.  and then we explored the creek!  and there were FISH in the creek... amazing, ne?  and there was WILD ONION.  like... just GROWING there.  and so jack picked up a few stalks and brought them home.  then we went back at 5.30.  then I pestered him some and he said he's show me his room.  yay!  so I saw his room.  he has this painting hanging up of a forest... and I laughed my head off over it.  it was so freaking funny.  yeah.  and I looking around and made him feel nervous, I think, because he kept looking at me.  and then his mom came home made me eat a popsicle.  and then she gave me these bunches of pens... cuz my mom told her that I like pens...?  O__ô  and then she gave me bunches of sticky notes...  and then she looked at my face... and touched it... and it was all very strange.  and then she touched the bump on my head and looked at my skin [cuz obviously my mom talked to her about my face?  my skin?  my bumps?]... and then she told me that she didn't want to talk about it with jack present... so it was all very very strange.  then jack was like, "I saw these really pretty blue flowers over thataway; wanna go walk again?"  and so me being the stupid person I am [and also b/c I wanted away from his mother], I said yes.  so we started out all over again.  "to collect flowers", you see.  but of course that didn't happen.  so we wandered and meandered around and he showed me the plano dog park.  then we walked some more along his creek.  we walked all the way past schimelpfenig library...  and then there was this part where he said he liked to go to skip rocks, so we went down there by the creek.  and I decided to go wading in the creek... and then it was slippery and mossy and algaey and so of course I slipped and fell in.  -_____-  and it was getting dark by then and I was freaking COLD.  I mean... COLD.  and then I tried to catch some ducks that were in the water... and of course I didn't catch them.  and then I went wading around some more.  then jack told me I'd better get out.  so I made him bring me my shoes and I got out.  hahahaha.  then we went walking along some more.  and we went exploring in all these little places... and it was so much fun!  then when we got to the pasture place... we found out that the city of Plano, in its efforts to "Keep Plano Beautiful", have MOWED THE ENTIRE PLACE!  so so so... all the flowers = GONE!!  and then we were sad/mad like >=(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((.  and then by that time it was like... 6.30 and rapidly getting darker.  so we decided to start walking back.  [cuz we're both just so smart like that.]  I swear... on the way back, he said, "it's getting dark" TEN TIMES.  at least.  and we talked about the creek flooding and random stuff like that.  and then we finally got back to his house at 7 and my mom was already for an hour just talking to his parents... yeah.  first thing when jack walks in... mom: congratulations, jack! jack: ö__ó me: what're you congratulating him for? mom:  his rank, of course!  i haven't congratulated him yet. me: ö__ó jack: thank you.  and then my mom dragged me home.  oh!  and when we got back to his house, jack's mom gave me another popsicle.  -___-;;  see, jack can refuse his mom, but I can't.  -sigh- or else it won't be polite.  -sigh-  so then I went home and ate dumplings.  and now I'm tired as all hell and I want to sleep.  so I shall.  okidoki.  byebye.  p.s. movie times scheduling is a freaking pain in the butt.
