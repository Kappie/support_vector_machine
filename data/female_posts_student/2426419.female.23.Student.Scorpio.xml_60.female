Okay, so here are my thoughts about tonight, (sorry if it doesn't make sense): At first, I was thinking, well that's great J but how are we any closer to knowing how to do evangelism?  The answer is to love Jesus more?  Now I need to know how to love Jesus more, too.  Then, I realized the point of the entire night.  I started thinking about what God showed me about relationships this week.  The focus in a relationship should be on the relationship itself, not on the "evangelism" part. So, we should love people more, which leads to relationship, and then just see what happens regarding evangelism.  This helped me get what we were talking about tonight because it is kinda the same.  If we love Jesus more, we become more in relationship with Him and then we just see what happens regarding evangelism.  The focus moves away from "how to" do evangelism.  It's all about loving Jesus. Then, I realized something.  In my life right now, I need to quit asking so many "how to" questions.  Here is my problem.  When I ask a question like "how do I love Jesus more", I don't have any answers.  I could say things like read my bible more, pray more, go to church more, etc. but that would be dumb for obvious reasons.  So, without any answers, I get discouraged and conclude that I can't love Jesus more and life is bad.    I know that it is my desire to love Him more, and that it is His desire for me to love Him more.  So, can't I just trust that it will happen without me asking the question of how.  Tonight my prayer was that I woud love Jesus, not that He would show me how to love Him.  From this I believe that evangelism will happen.  Also, I will desire more the things I talked about before (reading the word, prayer, etc.).  I am not trying to make a blanket statement that all questions are bad for everyone.  This is just where I am right now.  In my life I have been discouraged by asking how and not being able to reach any answers.  Now, I am just going to start doing.  Now on to other important matters.  I know that the squid have had an up and down season.  You must keep in mind, however, that the giant squid lives in the depths of the ocean.  They are not use to battles in shallow depths which explains this weeks low score.  BEWARE, though.  They have begun an extensive training program that will hopefully bring them into glory.
