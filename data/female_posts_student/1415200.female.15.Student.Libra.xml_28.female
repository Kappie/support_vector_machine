It is amazing to think that only 5 months ago I was laying around with friends complaining about being too hot, and thinking that I was going to die of heat damage. But I guess that just goes on to prove that time is going by so quickly we dont fully have a concept of it. I think everyones comming over today. It'll be entertaining.  I hate Christmas. I hate the corny, over the top, extent that people go thru to make it "special" yeah, it's special enough to puke over. If I was in charge of a household, I probably wouldnt even decorate. I see no sense in putting out all of this stuff, like statues, trees, tinsel, ect.. for a month out of the year, and then packing it all up so you can put yourself thru it again next year. I also hate the family get-to-gethers. Actually, I just hate family. They make to big of a deal about "how I've turned out." I think I turned out just fine thank you. I dont steal, I dont do drugs, I do really good in school, and I have alot of good friends. In my book that makes a pretty good person. Im still sick if anybody was wondering. If anyone cares.  I dont think anybody cares about me. They care about using me. They care about having someone to take their anger out on, or to get money off of. But once again, Im almost to the point where I absolutly dont care anymore...Im gonna go think about some stuff. I'll write later.
