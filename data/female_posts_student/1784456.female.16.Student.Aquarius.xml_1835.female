I am doing Geography tomorrow and poss media studies, then wednesday i am doing Psycho (!), and then thursday i am doing design tech and then biology! It's really funny, cos we have two ants nest in our rundown conservatory, and some of them are flying ants, and there is a little whole that is just big enough for the sparrows to fit thru, so they are coming into the conservaotry to get the insects and then they dont realise that there is actually glass there and they fly into it, altho the last bird was smart enough to realise it was glass, and no exit with out got thwack into it! its still quite amusing and the birds are so little and soo cute! lol! I am going to have to go on a huge shopping spree and get some more clothes for next. I have plenty of tops but i need more trousers (at the mo i have 3 pairs that are constantly on rotation) and i need to get some more jackets and jumpers cos i have three nice ones and one of them is a huge bright blue fleece (i'm sure u no the one i am talking about). This will please my dad becos he is always haveing a go at me about spending my money! Its strabge i dont write o here THAT often bt whenever i do, i start with nothing to write and then end up writing quite alot, most of it being complete crap!
