The only time someone has tried to hijack a plane on their own was when that AFrican bloke who was criminally insane tried to take over. But he really was mentally ill I think. If terrorists were going to hijack a plane and do something really evil and horrible, then I would presume there would be a few people, like a team of them. That's what they did on 9/11, I think.   I can't come to the cinema tomorrow, I have to be at work for 2pm. Sorry guys!  How typical is this- (you know on american web pages where they put the top-5 searches? This is one of them, and not off a dodgy site either, the netscape news site!):  Top Men's Searches     Wet T-Shirts  Beach Trips  Micro Bikini  Viagra  Adult Toys
