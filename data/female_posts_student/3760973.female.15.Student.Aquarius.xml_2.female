XD   I took a quiz once about Jack Sparrow. It was, like, which one of his speeches are you?   I got 'You have got to get yourself a girl, mate. ...Your not an eunuch, are you?' Much to my amusement. Appearently I'm horny and I think everyone else is that way, or should be.  Go figure, eh? XD  Anyway, much love for Erin's new RP character. Yay Nariko! He's staticky. Like Ellen.   Oh, and a random quote from Raphie:  "Let me go, and give me back my damn testosterone!"  Ahah. I also love Puck's control over hormones, damnit.     ... if you're not me or haven't RPed with me, ignore that entire last section.  Charlie, I love your haiku. And you're right, all haikus must involve cherry blossoms. XD    Much to my own amusement, I actually logged onto Blogger for the sake of just Blogging... something. I didn't care what, really. I felt like updating you all on my life. My boring life, but my life nonetheless.   Got into an argument with mum this morning, over the computer.   Hmph. No chocolate covered strawberries for her today. I was going to make them, too.  Ha.   So there.  I have discovered something about myself recently, actually.  I tend to be irritating when I angst. Like, I'll snap at people. Or just wallow in self pity. Anway.      Alias: Elle//fin.
