I miss behn but I dont want to be all whingey and "I cant live without my boyfriend" stupid so I hope its not just that.. maybe I just need a day or two to be in a pissy mood. That and I think Im sleep deprived.. Anyway Im gonna stop complaining now.  Rant Of the Day: My favourite sex songs Has anyone ever noticed how much sex is in the music industry but its never EVER portrayed as a loving thing anymore? Its all about horniness. In my opinion, the 2 best songs about sex are In My Room by Incubus and Crash Into Me by Dave Matthews. I mean, Dave Matthews is one sick kid and the lyrics are kinda weird, but its a good song. And Incubus is just amazing. I dont think I even needed to say that but I did anyway.  Man Im totally out of it today, Im gonna quit while Im... ahead?   This party is old and uninviting, Participants all in black and white. You enter in full blown technicolor, Nothing is the same after tonight.  If the world were to fall apart, In a fiction-worthy wind, I wouldn't change a thing, Now that you're here.  Love is a verb here in my room. Yes love is a verb here in my room.  You enter and close the door behind you, Now show me the world as seen from the stars. If only the lights would dim a little, I'm wary of eyes upon my scars.  Pink tractor beam into your incision Head spinning as free as dervish's whirl. I came here expecting next to nothing, So thank you for being that kind of girl, That kind of girl
