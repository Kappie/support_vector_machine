Even though the last two seasons haven't been the best, it's still like everybody's favorite show and wow for some reason it's really sad it's over. And Frasier is ending too. Two of the shows that seem like there's never been a time in my life when they haven't been there. On the previews they always have to have the inspiring piano music, and it's in black and white, and it's all dramatic and you're like SHIT why do i care SO MUCH. My world is coming apart at the seams. Sigh.
