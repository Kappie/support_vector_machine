It was crazy, because there were like...ten of us. Kathryn, Nikki, MC, and like...6 other people from Benet. It was cool. It's nice to hang out wth new people once in a while.   I'm thinking of going to sleep soon. I'm pretty tired, but...eh. I think I might just because there are 12 people, 6 dogs, and a cat in my house right now. It's crazy, and I don't really feel like socializing with adults right now, so...yeah. Maybe I'll go read. That could be nice. It's amazing how much less I read when I'm in school. I guess I just don't have time. Maybe when marching season is over I will.   Haha, everyone's already talking about homecoming and it's not until October. Gosh. So, for the next two months the little self-esteem I've gained since the last dance I didn't go to, I'll slowly lose. I don't think I really want to go alone this year, so...eh. I'llprobably end up just staying home. We shall see, we shall see.   Maybe I'll go socialize and get food. I mean, I figure I get something out of it, and they'll think I'm nice if I go down there, right?   It's either that or I sit here writing pointless things. Writing pointless things can be fun though.............  Fine, I'll go downstairs.   Wow, I just had a conversation with myself basically in my own journal. How strange am I?
