People say it's nice but I think they're lying or are just trying to make me feel better. I don't know. It's horrible though.  But I went to church today with my dad and when I came out some Mexican guy not exactly hit on me but was showing interest in me. Hee. It made me feel purty. Ha. Maybe I will wear my hair down more often if that was what it was. Our pastor is leaving the church in a month. Crazy crazy.  I just looked over and noticed I have 7 water bottles on my desk. They are all empty except one which I'm using as a vase for wildflowers. I went on a bike ride and stopped on the side of the road to pick them. Some guy passed me and a couple feet after that did a U-turn and came back. It was wierd but he looked at me like I was crazy, picking weeds and all on the side of the road and all.  I'm getting up early tomorrow to go to Richmond with my dad. To go to plan 9 music. I think maybe I've said that earlier but I'm not sure.  Oh yeah, I feel loads better than I did yesterday I feel asleep at about 12!! It was great. That's like what...almost 7 hours of sleep! I feel good. This means though that I won't be able to sleep tonight and I have to get up super early to leave for Richmond and I'll be so tired. But that's okay. I'm hoping to get any Built to Spill CD at Plan 9. I really really hope they have one. I'm pretty sure they do but I've only been a couple of times in a couple of years so I don't know. At any rate, I can't find them anyplace else, not Tower, nowhere (except the internet). But I live in the middle of nowhere so that isn't really saying much. Other than Built to Spill, if they don't have that I'm not sure...I have enough money for one CD...Refused. I want a Refused CD. That's all I can really think of. I'll probably just go with another CD from a band I already have CDs from to build up a collection. Most likely Morrissey, The Smiths or The Misfits. I feel like the Smiths though so I'll probably go with that.     Music: Moonlite Dreams - Tiger Army
