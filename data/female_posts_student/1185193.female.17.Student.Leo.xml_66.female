Teehee :)  My "friends" (with the exception of Danielle) are all jerks to me.  It's not what they do, it's what they don't do.  They are completely self-absorbed with no regard of another person.  They always just talk about themselves.  There is no such thing as a meaningful conversation with them.  They all live in a world of school and books with no spice in life.  Is it torture for them to maybe ask how I'm doing and show some kind of interest in me?  What the hell is wrong with these people?!  They're in their own shell and live on false happinesses.  They love to appear like well-rounded, perfect, "got-it-together" people, but they aren't.  They are show-offs and arrogant, pompous individuals.  How the hell did I ever get connected with them?  I felt invisible tonight.  Worthless.  The laser tag made up for it.  And the Togo's sandwiches.   Yum.  Okay, enough bitching for one nite.
