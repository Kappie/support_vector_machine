I mean, it's good for us to get away for a while. I kind of wish it was him getting away though because I dont like it when he's alone with his family. He gets grumpy, although I dont blame him. His family has problems, and I wish they didnt. Life would be so much easier for the two of us if his family was better. They all need help. Although, I am having fun at my grandmas. Not as much fun as I usually do, because I've grown up a lot...but its cool still. When I'm here, I watch a lot of home videos but all the ones I watched tonight were stupid because I'm a big big big retard.   I'm trading my computer desk with my grandmas I think, and if not I think that I am just going to get a new one. I want a black one, but I highly doubt that that will happen. I want to paint my walls red and then get a black comforter and stuff...Im getting either black or really dark wood for my room, nightstand, tv stand, head board, computer desk, etc. I hope that my parents let me re-do my room. These are the time when I wish I had a job so that I could pay for it. :-/..oh well. Grr  I miss Bill so much..I want him here with me. I get scared when I stay the night here. I get bad thoughts, and then I can't stop thinking about them. My grandma has a lot of plans for us for tomorrow though. She's going to fix my arm warmers that I made, and she's going to sew my shorts and stuff. I dont know what else we're going to do though. I hope that we have pancakes tomorrow..we most likely will, because...we always do in the morning. I cant publish this until after 10:00 because they're working on the site...so pretty much Im going to wait until then..I have nothing else to say.   Goodnight...
