But then I wonder if that's really the problem here. I mean, I have seen some pretty ugly ducklings that have someone to hold their hand. So maybe it is just my personality.    True, I do not really have any talents.  True, I am not really all that motivated.  True, I can be a bit blonde sometimes.  So I guess I can see what people are happy not missing.  All I am trying to say is that I suppose I know what the problem is...  Its just *sigh* frustrating.  Will all you do me a favor??  I would greatly appreciate it if someone would comment on here I tell be what the heck is wrong with me.  Do I have bad breath? Am I ugly? Am I a liar? Am I a fake? Do I have a horrible personality?  Maybe its just the teenage insecurities talking here, but I really want to know. You can even post it anonymously if you like. That way, you can dish it all out on me and not worry about I think about you.  **** Song of the Day: 'Love Song for No One'- John Mayer
