I reviewed my Bio - interesting stuff.  Now I want to be a Biochemist if teaching Bio fails, but most likely I will be a teacher.  I also finished my amazing Drama project, which I am certain it's my 110% best work.  I also come to a realization today.  I guess you could say a feeling came over me.  I just feel ready.  Feel like I know more now.  I feel smart, or more mature, or older, or I guess you could just say "ready."  That's what I feel.  I feel I a ready to drive, to get my license.  I should have waited before doing drivers ed, but whatever, it doesn't matter.  My dad flys in on Friday.  I am going to talk to him about takin drivers with a diff company and doing the stuff again.  I think doing the drivers course again would benefit me a lot.  I am almost certain he won't have a problem with it.  I all of a sudden want to drive, and be free, and just drive.  Strange feeling.
