Take Lord of the Rings, Matilda and even the Bible! All of these great books have turned into movies. Take the most recent example of the great book(s), I Robot by Isaac Asimov. Now i havent seen the movie so i dont know if they've butchered it or not, but the book is very intricat and  no one  could ever be able to portray that in a 2 hour movie. Another more well known example is the Harry Potter series bu J.K. Rowling. The books are very good pieces of childrens lit which im sure will become classics but the movies? i dont think they will go on the top shelf with The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music, just because they were made by money hungery prodicers and direcotors who wanted to make a quick buck. I mean, were at the 3rd movie and 5th book, the books took well over 5 years to write and the movies? possably 3. At this rate the movies will catch up to the books within a couple of years and bu then the actors will be older, well past puberty and unable to play their Harry Potter counterparts. And for what, so a bunch of people could get rich. Why not wait till J.K. is done writing the books to start a movie franchise. Or, start when shes at the 6th book so you can make your movies and not have to wait for, or rush the writer.  No back to the real reason ive started this rant. One of my favorite books that came out a few years ago called Abarat by Clive Barker, yes,  that  clive barker (the mastermind behind many of todays horror flicks) recently aquired a webpage (how sweet). Well upon checkign the website out i clicked on a link that said 'Movie'. My first reaction was 'cool an Abarat movie maybe it wont fall into the traps like other book-to-film books', but when i got to the opened link i gasped in horror (well not really, but for effect, lets say i did). Within the first paragraph it said (and i quote) "The book of ABARAT was so captivating that the Walt Disney Company purchased the movie, theme park, and multimedia rights to the series for $8 million dollars." ...(moment of silence for effect)... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i yelled, they cant do this to a perfecty good book and Disney for gods sake, WHY did Disney have to buy it! The book is going the way of Pirates Of the Caribbean (in reverse) with the disneyland ride!!! aarrgghh, im boiling with rage ready to bite the head off of the next passerby (which in this case would be Holly, excuse me while i run after her). Im sorry but there are going to be 4 books in the Abarat series (the second due in october) and they are wanting to start a movie now!!! It took Clive 2 years to write and illustrate the second one (im assuming he worked on it from when the first one was published), so if they wanted to do a movie now, they (thoes bastards at Disney) woudl be waiting a long time to do the last 2. Plus, this book is so rich with detail they would have to enclude  every  detain to make the plot make sence. As with I Robot, you simply cant fit that much detail into 2 hours of film.  Whew! Im done untill next time, -Leslee
