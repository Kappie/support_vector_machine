Today Jesse and I did some shopping for sexy lingerie online, just window-shopping. It’s always so nice to see what he will come up with and what he would like to see me in and it’s a little something we can do together. The fun part about it is it makes the time he has left seem shorter than it is. We also do online window-shopping with other items like books and computer supplies, but it is always so much more fun, and not to mention romantic when he is sending me links to beautiful robes and baby dolls and such and talking about how beautiful I would look in them. One of the items he found was a black leather mini skirt. I laughed because he was so adamant in buying it for me but at the same time it sparked a conversation about going out more when he gets back, because we weren’t ones for going out. Our going out was a casual walk or bike ride to Denny’s for shrimp scampi, for me, and a burger or steak, for him and then a casual stroll back home with our stuffed bellies. It was always so nice going to Denny’s but I think we have been to a nice restaurant all but maybe 4 times in the 6 years, 7 months we have been together. He promised me that would change and that we would make more time for each other.   It is always interesting seeing which direction our conversations will go after each link is posted from him. Its like a little lovers game of sorts and very fun because its something we both can be involved with even though we are ½ a world apart.
