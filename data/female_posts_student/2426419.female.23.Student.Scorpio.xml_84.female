I am going on 27 years old (good lord, I didn't think it was that old but when I typed the 2 and the 7 I got chills) and have yet to come across someone that I feel I could spend the rest of my life with.  I have heard it all from "god will send you someone when you are ready" to "you just got get out there bucko and find her" but all of those answers SUCK!!!!  But I must admitt that I have never been the agressive type so maybe that is my problem.  I desire to have that kind of relationship with someone so bad that it cosumes my thoughts a lot of the time and I don't really know what to do about it.  I am not like a majority of the guys out there that is scared of committment or strong emotions.  Actually, my emotions run crazy most of the time.  Anytime that a person comes along that I seem to connect with, I get attached very quickly.  So I don't guess there is actually a question in this blog and maybe not even a point but I just had to get some of this out, and the blog seemed like a good spot to do that.   Cody
