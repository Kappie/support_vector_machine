Nick and I have been walking like crazy! I do really well on my diet when Shawn is not here, but as soon as he gets home, something happens and I cheat. All will power is lost. Since this weekend we are going to Brooke's baby shower in the cities, I think I will be able to keep my will power up!  Nick and I had a pretty mundane Tuesday. Except for some fun for about 3 hours at G'ma Lu's house. Nick flirted so much with his grandma.  Miranda is babysitting Nick on Thursday so I can get a hair trim and highlts/low lts. YEA!!! I'm sure I'll be a nervous wreak with someone other than his grandparents watching him! I'm one of  those  mothers! Keely watched Nick a few weeks after he was born while my mom  I took a sauna less than 15 feet away and I gave her so many instructions!  Did you know that Leah can be spelled, Liya, and it's still pronounced the same as Leah...Keely told me that. I love "Liya"-it seems exotic! I am excited for tomorrow...Target shopping!  Nick did not have a good night last night due to tummy problems from watermelon that  someone  slipped him...;) But he's all better now.  I am exhausted.
