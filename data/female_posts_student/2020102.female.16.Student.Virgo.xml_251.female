Oz: (reading) What I thought to be, flowers soaring on the... (pause) bots -  Jacob: It's bough. Oz: I don't know, that's why I don't read.  "40 dollars, 40 dollars. If I take this will I get 40 dollars? Yippee skippee. I'm confused. SPAIN? You took out EIGHTY DOLLARS? Here, write a check. Well what is this. You have to use this otherwise it'll expire. You're right. Write. Write. You can do it! (something unintelligible) Yes but then you'll only have 78 cents. Yes you do care about a duck. Unintelligible? It's illegible. (Sarah explains that illegible is when you can't read it, not when you can't hear it.) Oh. I'm going to tell your mom. Okay. (Takes ring off her finger.) Sarah... I have something to ask you. Melanie... I have something to ask you. Involving you and a ring. You can't wear that on your left hand. No you can't. Who are you marrying? (rambles about Sarah not being able to write down what she's saying because she couldn't remember it all.) That's cheating and you know it. It has a really big loop. I'll be the shoelace. That's gonna sound really weird. That was so close that time. I had it in my hand. Viper? That would be me. You have the catlike reflexes. I am the viper. I GOT IT! I triumphed the cookie. The cranberry salad. Don't touch me. Uhhh... uh. You are weird. WHY ARE YOU WRITING IT! STOOOOOOOOOOOOP!" -Erin during Orchestra (just what she said, mostly. I don't write down what other people say, it's more entertaining this way.)  I have a lot of these little Erin rants lying around, maybe I'll type up some of the more entertaining ones later if I can find them.
