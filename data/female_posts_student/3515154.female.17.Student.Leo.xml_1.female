Well...my day started off with me talking to Deeann on the phone for a while...She was moving all her stuff that she had packed the night before out in the yard so when Ian came they could just load it up and go. Then, I was on the net for a while and David got on and read the email that i wrote him...it was a very long one. So then later yesterday afternoon David came over! He suprised me...lol I was actually in my room trying to call him when he drove up!! We had alot of fun and he soaked me with my squirt bottle so to get him back i spray painted his hair orange and black and gold! hahaha! We went outside and played football and did some other stuff;)I can't wait until next school year, so that we can go out again, Because I Really  LOVE  David. So then, David left and Dustin and Micheal called me...lol which really shocked me cuz I didnt think they were ever gonna call me! I talked to them for a while and I talked to David for a little bit on the phone and then I talked to Dustin and Micheal some more and then...Deeann came over!! I got to see her and I also got to see Ian and Ross...Its been a while since I saw Ross seeing as he lives in Celina! So after they left I got back on the phone with Dustin and Micheal and Dustin ate a fly...lol those boys are crazy!! Then I called David and we talked for about an hour or so, which was the longest we've talked in a long time, and then I got sleeepy and went to bed. During the course of yesterday I really upset Zach, which, I'm sorry about that, but I dont want to take back anything that I said to him. Oh and WAY TO GO CALVIN!! He got a 1 at state! And Jessica you need to get ur BOOTAY home...I gots stuff to tell ya CHIKA!!! Oh and DeeAnn..I miss ya already....YOU BETTER CALL ME ASAP!!!
