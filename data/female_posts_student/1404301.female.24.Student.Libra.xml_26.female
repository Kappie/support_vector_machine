In 1789, the French "Third State" composed of the poorest people in the country decided to start a Revolution against the King (Louis XVI), the Nobles and the Church (the richest if you prefer). This Revolution strated officialy on the 14th of July when the Bastille prison in Paris was taken by the bourgeoisie and the peasants.         The prison doesn't exist anymore but if you go to visit the capitale of France, there is a square called "La Place de la Bastille" where the prison was before (Metro - Stop: Bastille).         The "totem" in the middle of the square represents what happen on the 14th of July 1789 as a symbol.  This date represents the beginning of the French Republic (as the Monarchy was taken over) and it became our National Day. We are now living in the 5th Republic, it seems strange but the history of France is quite big. I won't tell you everything in this page but I advise you to read and get some information about it if you are interested. I don't know any good website that I could recommend but the best would be a good book.  Anyway, all those words to tell you that Dylan and I will be in Sydney on the 14th of July, I wanted to surprise him by inviting him to have diner in a French restaurant in Sydney but I couldn't keep my mouth shut...It was too hard!! But but but, we are surely going to celebrate it, french cuisine and french wine...yumi...VIVE LA FRANCE!
