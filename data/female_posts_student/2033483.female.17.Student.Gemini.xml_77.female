Except I don't remember how to make my links customized *hint Sean*    Nothing really worth anything happened today.  I felt really bad for Renae b/c she lost her ID and couldn't eat lunch even tho I offered to buy her lunch.  My Mommy felt bad for you, too, Renae.  Just another reason why IDs are stupid.    I swear boy/girl/it is haunting me!  Ever since I saw this girl in the girls bathroom that I always thought was a boy, I see her everywhere.  Maybe she knows and is punishing me for being so cruel.  But I feel extremely bad about this already, you have no idea.    This freshmen in my Chem class that sits in the row behind me always flirts with the boy sitting next to her.  I can hear her and you can tell the boy isn't having too much of it but goes along just to be nice.  It is the cutest thing.    "Ryan that sits next to me in Algebra" always talks to me about cars.  I know nothing about cars and stare blankly at him, but do you think he'd understand...no.  I don't know what is under the hood, all I know is that you need all of it to make the car go.  I don't car if the car is turbo charged.  I don't care if a car has flames coming out of the exhaust pipe.  I don't car what the proper name for the type of car is.  I don't car what kind of "system" a car has.  I'm not interested in those things but he doesn't get the hint and just keeps going off about cars.    Tell me what you think of the new template...
