But it's still worth checking out.    Well! I've changed my layout once again... I really like this one. n_n I think I'll stick with this for a while. It's even my fav. color! And I don't care if it's a dead color mom! >    Anyway, nothing much has happened lately. Jeth's now trying out his new disposable contacts. n_n;; And I quote:  My eyes!!!!  Haha, it's funny. n_n;;    Ergh, I'm a bit braindead at the moment.. I've been doing a lot since this morning. >
