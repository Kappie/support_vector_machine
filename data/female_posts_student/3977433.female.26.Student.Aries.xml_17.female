I was in a good mood all morning so far, and I hope that my thoughts can figure out themselves without bringing me down again. We will see...      For today, I am taking Wish and Gus outside, letting them play in the grass and sun. Then I'm going to shower and read. I have been trying to find somewhere that supplies hairless guinea pigs " Skinny Pigs " and they do have them in Espanola. Yay. There's just one downfall,...they're very expensive. But I did talk to the owner of the store and she's ok with me paying 2 payments for one. That's nice of her.      Anywho, not many read this or comment in this, so I will wish whomever actually takes the time to come to my blog, a nice day. It's monday, one less day until the weekend.       Ciao.
