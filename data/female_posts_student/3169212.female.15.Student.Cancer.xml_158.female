I agree he is wierd, for a pirate he is so mild mannered.  Do take in mind that i said "for a pirate".  Will is mine!  he is a blacksmith and he is sooo could looking!!  Jenn: *Cough*  Elizabeth: *glares*  I love him.  We met when we were 10.  *sigh*  And Orlando Bloom is some guy who i just slapped and is doubling over right now.  Should have slaped him with my hand in the face not my foot.  Jenn: ^_^  foot is good!  Um.. Orlando bloom is not that bad.  He said basicly on a audio interview i listened to that women were not as strong as men and that they were put on the earth for one reason.  I didnt like that, but i listened to some more that said that his idol was Johnny Depp who told him that women are strong if not stronger then men.  Then that he went on to tell bloom that he watched his wife give birth to their daughter and he almost fainted from her cutting off the circulation to his hand.   Elizabeth:  If woman arent that strong then why is he doubling over and i am not!!! HA - Evil twin of my dear sweet william!  Jenn:  yes, but Legolas and Will arent womanizers.  But true, "with any character you play there has to be a little of you inside or else it is not acting, its lying." -- Johnny Depp.  Good going Sarah!  Oh look Jack is back!! ^_^  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  ello, mates!  No time no speak.  it seems that the casher does not take Japanese money.  Oh and i know Japanese when i see it, i spent a long time with Inuyasha.  Uhem,, i wonder how i got that type of money Kuronue?!  And Sarah, love, im over it.  Why am i on your bad side?    Jenn: *singing* Why cant we be friends, why cant we be friends.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Shutup!  Jenn: Whatever you say.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  She is stairing at me wierd, mates!  Elizabeth:  Gin is ok, it is not Rum so Jack will not be interested.  Im more of a white wine spritzer.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Ah Gin.. gin is good!  It is more mild than rum, more of a desert wine for me, love.  I have recently ecperimented in prison and adding gin to rum.  it was good, i call it Sparrow Rum!  Jenn: sorry.  it has already been invented and givin a name by me!  Gin Rummy!!! Hahahahahaha.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I think im gonna leave, mates.  This woman is scaring me!  Jenn:  Ha, I scare all!!! *follows Jack*  Elizabeth:  Well, im going to go save Jack! Good day.
