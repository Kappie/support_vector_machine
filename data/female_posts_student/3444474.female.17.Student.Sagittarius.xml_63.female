I am teh excited about it too, I can't wait to see Mr. Schlusberg and Mr. Lerner, oh and Claudia and Kimmy and, oh man I am so stoked, lol. I'm going to be sitting there the whole time going, "I should be up there, wtf I should totally be up there on stage", but I think I needed this summer to work and do something different. Alas, I can do theatre at Purchase, I'm not worried about losing out on stage time, I just miss the feeling I get being on stage, it's like nothing you ever experience in your life, it's fantastic.   *sigh* Aaah the theatre, 'tis such a fleeting artform. I love it :D  I was looking at pretty diamond rings last night while I was on the phone with dave, that was fuuuuuuuuuun, lol. They were so PRETTY. If you want to design your own diamond ring, go to http://www.adiamondisforever.com and design your own engagement ring, or your own threestone diamond ring. It was so much fun, lol. Then I searched similar ones that they showed...SO GORGEOUS, some of them were amazing.   I decided awhile ago that I wanted a real claddagh ring as my wedding ring. I don't really care that I'm nowhere near Irish, I want one, lol.  I'm not talking about anything really relevant today, I'm just kinda bored at my desk. Procrastination is a fun sport, I think.   More later when I get back from the play, I have some coalating (sp?) to do.
