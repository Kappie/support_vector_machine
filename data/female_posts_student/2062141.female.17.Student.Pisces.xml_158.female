Then Jason Mraz tickets are on sale Saturday... again, no money. Wow I need to get a job.  Sigh.. well we're back at school... it can't be that bad because the next two weeks is WASL testing for the lower-classmen and that means LATE ARRIVAL for juniors and seniors! School started at 9:45 today.. somehow I was still late... hm. Well maybe it's cause I gave in and gave Charlotte, Nick AND Josh a ride to school. Yeah that'd do it. Well.. tomorrow I have to go in earlier for the Link Crew meeting at 8:00... still beats the fuck out of 7:20. I miss Spring Break.. it was just starting to get fun and then it died. I'm not sure what to make of my week... some of it sucked really bad and other times it was the best time ever... well that was only really two occasions and one of them was also the worst day ever. But then Charlotte slept over and that was great. Then Saturday was awesome. But.. now.. it's TUESDAY. Tuesdays suck. It was a weird day.. right after first period we had lunch, very strange. Then in History we watched this video on the Holocaust... sigh... i was crying for the rest of the day, thank you very much Mr. Page. I'd get into it but I might start crying again. It wasn't as graphic as some that I've seen but... it doesn't need to be. I can't think of anything more horrible and inhuman than that dark period in human history. Crap I need a tissue now. No one noticed or asked why I was upset but then again that's nothing new. Felt antisocial today. Meh. I couldn't go see Ryan today, felt bad, put me in a worse mood... and then I slept for like two hours which I never do in the day because now I won't be able to go to sleep... Yeah today kinda really sucked. I need a hug. But... there's no one here. There's not even anyone to talk to.
