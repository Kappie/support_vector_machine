But then again, if you don't that means more sweets for me, tee hee! Ok, so Rosie is being smelly... I could go on a moral rant but it would probably be too similar to yours, Katie, so I won't for the benefit of all those (yeah, right) sad people reading this who don't want to read our badly-written ramblings more than once. Yeah so the new person - just a little scary! Mr.K introduced me as - "A lovely girl, but very common," The ckeek!
