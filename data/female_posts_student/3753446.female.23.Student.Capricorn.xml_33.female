The song they played the most often was "Freefalling" by Tom Petty and its been one of my favorite songs ever since.   I knew there had to be a reason.   Here's the full story of my first skydiving experience, my own personal account:   For a full 24 hours, I was pumped, and way too excited to study. I was on the phone talking to people, friends in Cbus and elsewhere, getting tips from veteran skydivers,visualizing the jump,andeven getting a couple of "farewell" hugs from Ruthann and Victoria (which did freak me out a little).Then around 3 PM Friday,it came time for Aaron and me to go to Richmond. About 20 minutes into the drive, it really hit me thatgoing skydivingwas no longer just a fun idea, but a real experience, we were REALLY going to go do this thing. HOLY SHIT MAN! That was a crazy realization, or maybe it was then that I realized I was actually crazy. Crazy or not, from what I remember, we listened to some good CDs, hid our nerves best we could, and finallyarrived atatinyairport outside Richmond, IN where we met Donny and his friend Kevin.   The people at the office were fun-spirited and really nice. That made me feel a little better right away. But then came waivers. I think I signed in at least 15 or more places that I "understood that skydiving is a dangerous sport" that I "understand that I could be killed or mangled in efforts to skydive" and that I "will not hold Wayne County Skydiving accountable should these events happen." All those nerves I had overcome during the drive came back like a flood as I signed those. It was a slow and steady reality check. And to top it off, I made a nice dent in my credit card as I paid for the whole experience.   Training took about 2 minutes! My instructor, Jason, gave us a quick overview on plane exiting posturesand pointed out where the ripcord was for the parachute. I started to get really nervous when I realized I missed that part about the ripcord!   Donny and Kevin decided to go first, so Aaron and I watched as they got all suited up in the UGLIEST jumpsuits imaginable. They were navy blue and neon orange. Truly disgusting. Anyway, it only took a few minutes for them to climb into their gear, and then got on board the tiny plane. It took literally foreveruntil they finally parachuted down, but they made it down safely. It was good to see them. I knew then that I would survive my own jump. Thanks guys.  Then it was time for Aaron and me to go. While Aaron got towear a larger sizeblack and red jumpsuit, Isported Donny's used navy blue and orange one. Yeah I know. I paid 159 bucks to wear my friends sweaty jumpsuit? But it was too late to turn back. The thing was way too long on me, andwhenI got my gear on finally, the whole middle part of the jumpsuit wrinkled up like a scrunchie. Eeeeww. Ah well, IWAS intending to jump out of a plane notpose for agirly mag.   Once we were all suited up, the instructor guys started making fun of me cuz I was nervous. They would ask eachother "Hey, did you check her gear? Don't mind that guy that you're jumping with, he's new." ETC. It kind of worked though, because in laughing at myself I remembered torelax againand have fun.   So, we climbed into a Cessna jet the size of a Mazda Miata. It was so small the only way for me to sit down was to have my legs entangled with my instructors, which I honestly didn't mind. ;P  And poor Aaron was squashed between the pilot and the door of the plane. The way we were all sitting, I couldn't see Aaron at all. That was hard because I was REALLY nervous once we got on the plane, and it would have been nice to have my buddy around. Thing is, when I'm nervous I get quiet. And to beat it, I have to talk. So I ended up talking to the instructors for the whole 30 minute (?)climb to 11,000 ft. Iknow I was definitely nervous because in addition to asking them EVERYSINGLE question I could think of about skydiving, I even talked to them about our MD PhD program and our 7 yrs-7 jumps deal and how I hadn't told my mom and howshe would be sooo mad at me,yada yada... Sure it might have bored them to tears, but I felt sooooo much better. I bet these instructors hear a lot of great stuff during the flights up.   At least the instructors sang me a song together. "Fly fly fly your plane, gently through the sky... Merrily merrily merrily merrily, we're about to die!" And it was even in tune. Lovely. :P Oh, and then, sometime around 7,000 ft, one of the instructors asked Aaron and me if we had ever felt zero gravity. I didn't know what he meant, and then next thing I knew, the plane took a nosedive for 5 seconds and we allFLOATED in the cabin! Aaron somehow wound up in our section of the plane, and somebody's pen landed in my gear but we sorted all that out real quick.Zero gravitywas TRULY an amazing feeling. It makes me want to be an astronaut. :)   We soon reached 11,000 ft altitude and it was time to go. The instructors hooked themselves to our gear and tightened everything. When my guy asked me how I felt, I told him I was ready to go. My body might have been shaking but that was all that was in my head: Cmon, Bring it. :) I watched as Aaron climbed out onto the step and next thing I knew he was gone! If reality hadn't hit me fullforce yet, it did then. I climbed out there myself and crouched the way they had showed us. As I sat out there for a couple seconds and looked out, I was astounded that I had even made it that far. And next thing I knew, Rock, 1, 2, 3.... and I was airborne!   The initial shockcanpretty much be summed up as "What the hell?!?!" I think I was reaching for something to hold onto or step on, and then next thing I knew, I was on my back, watching our plane fly away without us. As I rolled over to face ground again, I finally remembered that I still had an instructor attached to me and I had to position myself accordingly. Apparently I kicked my instructor in the butt around that time. But he was nice about it. We did some horizontal spins, which I loved. And then, it was time to check the altimeter and pull the ripcord. As I mentioned before, I missed that crucial bit of info in our rapid training course, so I tugged at something that I thought* was my ripcord, and it obviously wasn't! The altimeter was going down fast though, we were at 5,500,so I pointed at my instructor and he found it and pulled it for me. I think I'm going to regret that until next year's jump. I've got to pull my own cord!   When the parachute deployed, I felt a huge TUG upwards at my shoulders and my legs. That was when I really took in the view. My first words were "WOW. That was the most amazing thing I have ever EVER done." I totally loved parachuting. It was a slow descent with an awesome view. And the instructor even arranged to do a quick fly-by near Aaron's parachute. We weren't the greatest conversationalists in the air. I think I screamed "Whoohoo!!" and he said "HI!" I distinctly remember hootin and hollerin all the way down in my parachute. I felt like I was at a rodeo or something and all I could do was celebrate how much fun I was having. I figured, dammit, the world needs to know. :P And from hundreds of feet away, Aaron could hear me. But ohh, my poor instructor. Hehe.  About four minutes after our parachutes opened, we hit the ground, with a "tippy toe soft landing" as promised on the website. And what a reception! Donny and Kevin had recruited a member of the office staff and they all met us out on the field. Cameras going off, hugs all around, high fives. It was awesome. And the instructors even showed up with certificates and "report cards" of our dives. I felt like I had won some big prize. And I think, in fact, I had. Sappy as it sounds, I had definitely wonahugedegree of faith in my own courage, willpower, and independence. GO ME.  After a TON of phone calls, Aaron and I celebrated on the drive home by having asteak and ribs dinner at TGI Friday's, and playingour favorite Game Show Networktrivia game.Can I just make one point about steak and ribs though? Have you ever changed your order at a restaurant because someone else you're with ordered the same thing? Aaron refused to order the New York Strip steak when he realized I was ordering it. Since when do I have a monopoly on New York Strip steak? I'm glad he was happy with his ribs, but after seeing the guy jump from a plane, I thought food ordering would be a more trivial matter, no? Touche. I made up for it by letting him win the trivia game in the restaurant. ;P  In reflection, the day wasexciting, memorable, and life-altering. After enjoying the air, it felt unreal somehow to be on the ground again, doing normal things like eating anddriving and using the phone. It felt that way for all of Saturday too. Life was so blase again, back to biostatistics class as usual, and it was hard to believe that the whole experience had even happened. In the back of my mind though, all I could think about was the skydive, and how I wouldimprove next time, and how I still cannot believe Igot myself to do it.But I DID. And I guess that means I can do anything I put my mind to.  And as for the question, will I ever go back and do it again? Well, in addition to Aaron and my 7 yrs-7 jumps deal, I honestly think I left my heart in the sky. Guess I'll just have to go back and get it now, won't I? :)
