It was hardly even six thirty when mom and I looked up into the clear blue sky and we saw it. Just a little streak of blue light flying across the sky into oblivion. So beautiful. It was like some kind of omen, that the rest of my day would be just as beautiful. I learned something important today. Never trust omens.
