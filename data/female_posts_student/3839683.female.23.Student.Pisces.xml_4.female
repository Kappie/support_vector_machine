Possibly it's the fact that at the end of summer rob gets to come home for 15 days. It's something to look forward to but seems really far away still. I haven't really done half the things that I had wanted to this summer and its already the middle of July. Oh well there is always next year right? I went swimming yesterday.. Well actually it was just suppose to be a boat ride down on the lake. It turned into me having to swim behind the boat while my brother laughed at me and kept me from getting in. I really didn't mind though since it was really hot out. I can't imagine being over in Iraq right now with 120+ temps. The thought makes my face want to melt. We are experiences a severe thunderstorm right now so it's pretty nice to get a cool down.  The most exciting thing about my summer so far is that I downloaded the new yahoo messenger and have been jamming to the yahoo launch music on it. It's pretty cool... You can listen to almost anything on it. Wow I really need a life. I wish I didn't live so far into the country..the ice cream man could visit me.
