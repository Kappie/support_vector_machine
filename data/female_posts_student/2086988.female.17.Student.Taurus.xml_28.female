One, is getting caught naturally, but I am good at BSing and I do have alot of my friends to cover for me, so hopefully that won't be a problem.  Two, I just have that fear of you know him seeing me and not being good enough, like maybe I don't look good enough for him, we all know I get self conscious, lol Kiera and Ritika so hate me for that. I can't help it, I guess we all have this perfect image of ourselves :::sigh::: But then I think again, he's probably feeling the same way, then I think no matter what he looks like or whatever I love him and that's all that matters, so then I shouldn' t worry. But yeah, those are a couple of my fears, nothing too big I can't handle, everything is going to be fine. We're going to meet, and then be together for 3 whole days...all I want to do is cuddle, hold hands, kiss, lay on him. I really can't wait for New Years, we can kiss at midnight on New Years Eve, how romantic is that? :D Ahhh, I just wish it was that day already, I hate waiting...   I knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life
