Eugh... oh well, we'll all flukily survive some way or other (it always happens like that) Damn, just got it for another two years after that. :| I'm crazy! Aww, good luck Laura... and generally everyone who is doing GCSE maths cause we all need help! Oh, did you know that some year 10's are going to be doing it with us, a year early? How stressful must that be, fitting the whole GCSE course into a year! We're gonna be soooo gutted if they get better marks than us!
