Any way, I'll be checking that out on babble fish unless I find that I can go without needing the loo for two weeks... ok, straight to babble fish! Mmm... hehe, I'm gonna have fun looking for tacky presents for you lot! (You better get me one too!) Hehe, might get Izzy some Spanish thing and watch her try and translate it! Ooh, I'm feeling evil! What are we gonna do about Laura's birthday present? How are we gona give it to her? Oh well, I guess it's okay if you give it to her Izzy, you can tell me the reaction! Laura, you better practise your 'wow this is great' thing, because you're gonna need a lot of practise with what we got you! Hey, no one's here, well my Dad is but he's asleep. He's mega stressed from work and I have a feeling that we all need this holiday! Every one needs a holiday, especially when you go to our school with those certain lovely lettuces who feel it is their constant duty to remind us how much we need to get away from them. Yep, ultra nice people aren't they, to remind us alllll the time. (Little too much on the sarcasm.) Oh, I'm sorry, have a block of gold. (*raises eyebrow* Forgot to take the pills again, huh?) Yerp bubi!
