(which really sucks if you are 5'4) if you have never been to one of these things, you are missing out. no, really. it is not a poetry reading, where artsy types stand on stage and simper in haiku. and it is not a beatnik thing, with everyone in black. its a slam. a contest. these people get up on stage and tell their stories in rhythm. its fascinating. some poems are heart wrenching, some are angry, some lustful, some hysterical. the judges hold up their scores, and as the mcee reads them out, the audience judges the judges. if the crowd thinks the score is too low there is a collective- ooooohhhhhhhhhh groan! its fun. MP and TK tried to meet me there after work,  but the bouncer turned them away because the bar was at max capacity. i saw them exit and was about to follow them out, but the mcee said there was to be one last poem. a tall man in horn rim glasses and a cowboy hat took the stage. last time i went to the slam, me and MP accidentally stole his lone seat while he was up, so i felt sneaking out during his performance would be over the top rude. in the first round he had recited a poem of love for his girlfriend who sat in the back, her feet guarding his chair. he told the crowd this was to be his last slam.  he was moving back to ohio to be with his girl. after the collective cry of disappointment he began. i shamefully admit that i wasn't paying too much attention, wondering if MP was waiting.. in the last line he said- "when i read this to you on the phone, you said i must be tired..." the audience laughs. then he unexpectedly gets off the stage. he walks straight back to the rear of the room. the audience is clapping for his performance, but they suddenly fall silent as the man in the cowboy hat drops to his knee, and takes his girl's hand. "you were right, i am tired. tired of not seeing you, tired of not waking up next to you, tired of missing you." he takes out a ring from his shirt pocket. "i know this isn't much, but i love you, and promise to always love you...  ...will you marry me?" the girl replies, "yes, of course" and they kiss,  oblivious to the yelling, applause, and misty eyes that surround them. romance still exists...i saw it with my own misty eyes.
