She had to fall in love with love, before she could fall in love with a person.    29th February, will u be there?   This is a story abt a gal who truly believes that her Mr right will appear 1 day, n she's willing to wait for the right one even if it's years of waiting... One day when she was walking on Orchard Rd, she was totally charmed by Jeremy, who was sitting in a cafe, knowing that he's her dream man. Least did she expect tt he would also be the one who was going to hurt her deeply. She made her move in a most creative, imaginative and brilliant way any gal could ever think of. Enthralled by the idea, Jeremy agreed to meet her. It's fate which brought them together n it's also fate which caused the misunderstandings.   I like this novel, it's totally different from the other love stories i had read. This bk is amazing, writing abt the magic of luv n destiny. N it also showed how vulnerable luv is when 2 ppl r from 2 different places meeting at a magical place... haha.. so i really hope u guys can check this bk out. written by catherine lim. :D  Wif lodsa luv, ShIyUaN
