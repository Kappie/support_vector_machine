And then there's the drama queens, sitting on the side of the pool with their feet in it so they don't mess up their hair or makeup. What do these girls get out of this kind of lifestyle? Is it fun to be so stuck up and to know that if you don't date the right guy, wear the right clothes, and speak the correct lingo ( which is goldspeak ) that your " friends" will just dump you and move on to the next loser that comes along? Maybe these girls should do as the Bible says and stop trying to impress humans and start trying to impress God. These girls will probably go to college to get a degree that in the end they won't be able to use. Then they'll get married at about 35 have 1 kid then divorce their husband ( who they only married for his money and "friends" ) and collect child support for the rest of their kid's life. While their kid grows up in a daycare, they will be out partying and acting like a bunch of teenage girls so strung out on hormones that they'll jump in the sack with any and every guy that comes along. Am I the only one who thinks this insane? Girls get a REAL life!!
