I get very distracted very easily. Daniel helped me all day and he was basically my motivation. He was like a slave driver, making me work! I'm kinda glad though because I never would have finished and started a new one. So these projects are basically under-the-table work for my dad who owns a car shop. He is making conversions from subarus into volkswagen vanagons. A lot of people like them and their really fast. Hopefully I'll get two done tomarrow. Mom is on the island tomarrow and the next day to help one of dad's friends clean his house. He married a Russian woman and she is coming to live with him sometime this month so he is doing major cleaning. Saturday I'm going to a car wash to raise money for swim team which I am joining this school year. A few friends have already been doing it and I love to swim so why not right?
