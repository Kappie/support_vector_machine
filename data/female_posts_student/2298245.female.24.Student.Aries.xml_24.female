       
      The first sign of trouble was upon my last visit The loss of my bed. I walked by the room and found it occupied By another. In my room. Little was I to know at the time That this would be the last time My feet would grace the presence Of that humble yet majestic abode. I was to be cast aside, Forgotten, Like last year's Christmas toys When the new ones are opened. I'm last year's model, Tattered and torn, Welcome outworn, Never to return to the house and the family I love Who I thought loved me. It is the end of happiness And the beginning of that which follows it. I am utterly and hopelessly alone.
