There in Cuba, I studied folkloric conga and bata rhythms, songs, and dance.   Q: What do you do to prepare before you go on stage for a show?  A: As far as warm up stuff goes, it does help to meditate and stretch before a show.  I'll do some basic ashtanga yoga, and I breathe and think positive thoughts for myself, the other musicians and crew, and the audience -- even if it's just for a few seconds.  I also do rudiments with a thick pair of sticks, and sometimes a metronome and a pad.  That is really important.  When I get on stage and kind of nod off, it's just a meditative thing.  Jack and Merlo are such amazing, sensitive players that I try to tune in to what they do.   Q: Is it hard to stay healthy on the road?  A: I try to eat well, but I did get the nickname "Topol-Creams" from Merlo because I can't pass up a Crispy Cream donut.  More times than not, I will run for comfort food (sweets, things with white flower or sugar).  I do try to eat right though.   Q: Do you have any side projects that you're working on?  A: Yes, my As-Yet-To-Be-Named Afro Cuban Project.  I am in the process of recording an Afro-Cuban Folkloric record.  Cuban heavy-weights Juanito Florez and Teresita Dome-Perez (Afro-Cuba de Matanzas), as well as David Leach, Luca Brandoli, Dixie ?Cookiemonster? Ipina, Mike Ellison, and the fragrantly pleasing Miles Perlich will be throwing down serious rumbas (barring any band mutinies).  Jack and Merlo will be forced at gunpoint to add to the groove.  Hopefully Justin and Raul from Ozomatli will join in the fun as well.   Q: What other music are you into?
