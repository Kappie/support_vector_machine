I went to get some of my digital photos printed up and I also popped into La Senza (don’t have a total heart attack Melanie – was only looking for a PJ top to go with those bottoms!)  Then I met up with some of the Navs to play ultimate Frisbee.  Our team won the first game 8-0 and then we swapped around teams and we lost 5-4.  Was great fun and Ryan even complemented me on my amazing back-roll!  I discovered acrobatic skills I never knew I had.    I watched Pearl Harbour with my flatmates last night. Slightly patriotic for the Americans but a good film. Except the stupid BBC decided to stop it half way through to show the news!  So anyway didn’t finish until almost midnight.  Today I had lectures.  This morning my class went on an outing!  Well there was only the lecturer and 2 of us, but we went to see this local community project.  About 12 years ago these 2 ladies turned this derelict, rat-infested rubbish site behind their terraced houses into a green garden/play area.  They now hold community events and organise stuff for the kids.  They are still so committed and passionate about improving their community.  It was really inspiring.  I really wanted to get out there and start changing the World, but my lecturer reminded me that I didn’t necessarily need to change the World; I can make a difference in my own way, one small step at a time.  I really like my lecturer he is very passionate about Fairtrade, ethical living, and environmental things.  He just spent the weekend in Wales at this eco-place where you have to generate your own electricity and deal with all waste.  Sounds great fun.  My lecture this afternoon was rather close to the bone, but ok.  Was all about individual behaviour change.  They always encourage us to look at our own experiences in order to attempt to understand how to help others.  So we had to think of something we are trying to change about ourselves (I have just a few!).  We had to ask ourselves if we are aware of our beliefs, do we rationally think about things? How do I respond if my behaviour is challenged?  Why have I become aware that I need to change my behaviour?  What are the constraints to me changing?  What’s holding me back from changing?  Mmmm………  Then met up with Galls (he runs Navs in Brum) to plan some fundraising events to raise money for the guys going to Tanzania this summer.  I am going to write lots of letters – my favourite pastime!!  Anybody have any exciting fundraising ideas?  All suggestions welcome!  Oh – Jo had a baby girl at 10:00 – 7lb 13oz – a little girl who they have called Rachel Harriet!  Thanks for your thoughts.  take care guys mexxx
