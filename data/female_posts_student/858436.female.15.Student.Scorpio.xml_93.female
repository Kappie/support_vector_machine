We ate pizza and stuff and then around 9:30 Huskey aka the molester haha, Anwar, and Kies all came over and stayed till like, 1:30. And we all piled into Huskey'scar to go get a movie.. then to Wal-Mart.. then back to the movie store and we ended up getting "Meet the Parents". So we watched it at Sarah's and hung out and stuff and then Kies and Anwar played the guitar and Caro did some freestyle singing which was tooooooo funny!Then after the guys left Sarah ended up falling asleep and the rest of us did prank phone calls which was sooooooooooooo funny!!!!!!!! OMG I haven't laughed so hard in such a long time and that felt really good. "This is Wong Chong Ching from China Palace..." "DON'T FOCK ME OVER!!" "You know how when you smile you get dimples on your cheeks? Well I have those on my ass because I am FAT so don't fock me over!!" LMAO! Holy crap that was hilarious! And then we went to bed around 5:00 A.M. and slept till about 1:00 P.M. and had cinnamon rolls haha. Then I had to go to work at 3:00 which sucked, but no one was there so I just kinda rested. Omg last night was soooo fun!!!! :-D
