I'm a little concerned though, as I've been out of town since Friday morning, and my fridge doesn't keep food well.  It's like....   the petri-fridge  .  Jason, my thoughts are with you.  I recommend you stop eating my food and just throw it all out, and I'll make you something to bring home with you later!   I have things to write, I can't keep them in much longer but I have to go to the South Shore to vote for the next PM.... Shall I vote for what I believe in or shall I vote strategically?  I have an hour to decide.  I'll update again tonight...
