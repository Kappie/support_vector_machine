Dip It Low Christina Milian   My opinion: I think Britney Spears is starting to make appropriate and cool music that you actually want to listen to. And I think JoJo might make it, but I don't know. Now Usher....I just love Usher,he is sooo hot, and a great singer, but mainly HOTTTT!!!!!! I have no idea who Christina Milian is though!! thats my view!!
