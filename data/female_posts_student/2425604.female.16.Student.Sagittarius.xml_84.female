That's alright because, I can handle all that you throw down.   And I hope you find a perfect place where skies are beautiful all of the time. That's all that matters pretty pretty. And I know that's all that you could care about. There's no reason why you can't.  It's all about the icing Nobody cares about what's inside. You could see the outiside face. It looks good it must be great. And I know that is all you see. What would it matter anyway, Cause I could see right through, Your pretty pretty skin, today.  And I hope you find a perfect place where skies are beautiful all of the time. That's all that matters pretty pretty. And I know that's all that you could care about. There's no reason why you can't.  No reason why I should try to go on anymore My reasons all gone. No reason why you should,  Try to make excuses to make me feel alright. Excuses call for stupid reasons. And I know that it's not much that I can offer right now. Just give me one little second And I will try my hardest  To make you feel like I'm someone else.   im doing a facial thing... im gonna get my hair cut... im kinda sad right now i just like cried so i got my mask wet .. damn it all and im watching my new dvd its so good ... all of the uncut out takes are so funnie lol ... ill just have to sit and watch them alone ... not like anyone would wanna anyways ... o well im sure im gonna find something to do today ... o well ok im gonna go now ttyl
