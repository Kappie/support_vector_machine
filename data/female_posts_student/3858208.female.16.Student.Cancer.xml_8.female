How bad can it really be? I'll be the first to point out that I bitch about my life on a regular basis, but in many ways I feel like I'm justified in doing so.  My mom has cancer.  If that doesn't put a damper on happy hour, I don't know what would. On top of that, I'm still battling depression. So I have somewhat of a right to be upset about my state of affairs. What annoys me is people who write "oh, damn, I lost my address book, my life sux, now I can't throw a giant party-for-no-reason with my parents money, what will I doooo?" Jeez. I just want to slap people like that. If you think losing your address book sucks, try losing your family (emotionally; they're still here physically) due to your mother's cancer. Now  that  qualifies as a "bite me, I hate life, things will never improve" situation.   In other news, I  did  just whip out three - no, four -  urlLink poems  in the last hour.  Now iff you'll excuse me, I'm going to go be alone with my thoughts.     RIGHT NOW     mood ::  antisocial   listening to/watching ::  WinAmp - Riot Girl by GC   eating/drinking ::  nothing...   craving ::  *you*   talking to ::  nobody   thinking about ::  thanks for the link, Jenn!   wishing ::  uhh that I didn't feel sick.   wearing ::  Love-A-Lot Care Bear pjs   random ::  I went swimming today.
