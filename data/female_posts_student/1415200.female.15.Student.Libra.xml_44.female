Cold Pizza. Sparklers. "Coke-a-Cola." Yelling out the window like a retard at Ryan, Jon and T.J. Barb-b-cue Chips.  I thought. "Hey dummy, it's new years. I need resolutions. Cool resolutions." So, I thought what better place to put them but my blog-of-fame. Or, blog-of-shame. 1.) Forget about any feelings I have previously felt for *shall remain silent*  2.) Become a in-cogneto-super-hero. (anime-style. ah-hahaha.) With select powers I will list after..*grin*  3.) Become more self-confident.  4.) Loose (atleast) 10 lbs. (I kno, I had to throw it in!!)  Thats about it. I only want to make those I think I can accomplish! And I think those are pretty good. Ok. Now I'll elaborate on the super-powers. The power to fly. ( a must!) Ablity to teleport! (totally awesome) MindReading. (another must) Immortality. (^^) The power to make guys fall in love. Any guy. *wink* I think thats about all for right now. I'll for surley come up with some more later on. I'll update again then too. Ugh! School starts again in 4 days. That is Monday. Too soon. I don't want to deal with *HIS* bitchass and the problems that risen over break. Oh, well. I guess I'll say enough is enough cuz it's not comming back from him. I can't win. I need to stop expecting change.
