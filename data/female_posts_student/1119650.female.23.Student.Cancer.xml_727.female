Its absolutely insane here at work (July is always the "busy" month for me) and I only have 18 days of proper work here left (23 if you want to count the total number of days from now til the 29th).  I'm not sure that I'll get around to writing much in the next few days, but I'll try.  I had a really stellar weekend with the most amazing boyfriend ever and lots and lots of really great friends.  I have decided to go back to  urlLink slingin' lattes  as a part time solution to supplement this job's income and give me something to do so I'm not totally unemployed.  Oh yeah, plus tips from that job, so don't forget to tip your cute, lil redheaded baristas.  :p  I think thats it for me, nothing too great to blog about, hopefully the Don will come through with somethin' big and give us a post or 2 in my down time, but he's been quite busy as of late as well, building pools, burying bodies, you know...the usual.  Also, congratulations are in order for Tina, John  Tristan Bentley on welcoming the newest member of their family, Seth Michael Bentley into the world.  Seth, was born on June 28th, so you know he's gonna be a good egg (c:
