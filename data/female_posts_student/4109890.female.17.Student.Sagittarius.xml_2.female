But we started a 500 piece puzzle, and I got a headache. Haha. When I got home, my headache worsened, so I took excedrin, and it helped a little. I got home a little after 10, and my parents weren't home! After an hour, I got kind of worried, so I called, but they were at the Yeh's house partying it up. Haha.       I have no idea why I feel so stressed out. Planning an evening of bowling or any other event for ATPC should not stress me out this much. I know this stress is coming from my personal problems. Aiyoh. I shouldn't be upset about this, but I feel...like argh. It's so frustrating. When I have problems with people, I don't think I communicate it well to them. It's...really frustrating. I guess I expect people to understand it when I'm upset and why I'm upset. I need to vent.       I feel a little better...
