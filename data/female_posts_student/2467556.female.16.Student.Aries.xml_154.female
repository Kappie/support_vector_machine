MY INTERNET LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!   so now that the comcast people have fixed it, i can go back to my normal everyday life.  yay.  harry potter comes out today and i want to go see it really REALLY badly.  i dunno if thats going to happen now....but i have a car so its all cool!  yeah, thats right, i have a car! its actually my parents, but i use it more than they do.  Its a manual car that i learned how to drive, an 80-something tracker.  Its red and old.  Very nostalgic.  I want to name it, but i have no idea. Kubic thinks i should name it Niko, but its too much of a hard core awesome car to name it Niko.  So i gotta find a different name fast.  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
