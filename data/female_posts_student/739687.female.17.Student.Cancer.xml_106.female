K-Town won another football game, but it  WAS  against Boswell, so what can I say. Well, things aren't so bad lately. I have nothing to rant about, so there isn't a whole lot to say. Except for the fact that people try to make decisions for me, and act like I'm not capable of just doing things on my own. It's like they all want me to just live in a box by myself for the rest of my damn life. It's dumb, why should everyone else care so much about what I do. And when they try to talk bad about people, they sound like hypocrites. But that's okay, they can go on doing what they do, and I'll just mind my own business and ignore them. :)  Anyways, that's my pointless ranting...see yall laters.
