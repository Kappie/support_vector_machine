Anyway, I have some pages I wanted to post in here...from before because it wasn't letting me get this blog :P  January 1st-27th Relationship wise, I want someone I care for to be with me like Kat and Mylo.  I thought B would be that person, but I made a mistake by ranting off about things with Kat.  B always seems to be playing CS whenever I'd want to talk to him, and I don't ahve the heart to make him stop playing the game he loves soo much.  I want to put my mom's, dad's, sister's, Kat's, and B's happiness before mine.  Why should I be happy when no one else is?  I feel like I shouldn't, so taht's the way I treat it. I want people to understand my feelings...I want to be around someone who always know's what I'm thinking so i don't always have to explain myself.  I don't explain my feelings to others, becaseu I'm afradi of the reaction I would get to what I say...but I've learned, slowly, that I need to talk about how I feel or it ends up making everything worse then it already is.  Why do i do that?  Why can't I just express my feelings? I like the idea of this...my consence is in my stomache :P thank you kat for pointing that out....yes, it's sounds weird, but so far it's been true.  It's a really fun way to find out what I'm really feeling. Damn.....my thoughts just keep coming back to B.  There was an interesting fight yesterday...Kat went to bat for me because I didn't feel like coming out and saying everything I wanted to.  She didn't really twist what I said to her, but took the meanings differently then what I thought I put them out as.  So she went out on B and now they hate eachother, putting me in the middle.  Yes, I can make a choice and not have one of them in my life, but I want them BOTH there.  B is the caring guy I thought I would bever hace or see agian, and now he wants to just be friends...and kat is the closest person I have at this tie in my life.  They're both very important to me and I don't want to make that choice.  I know where I want to go with B...I want to be his gf...I don't want to foget what happened..I want to keep going, but add in things we should've done first, like know eachother.  To me, I could work around it and get everything to work out, but I'd have to do it myself. Withough myself knowing it, I let my heart get tossed freely into a relationship.  It just happened...I don't know if it's love..I wouldn't know since what I thought it was ended badly.  I never thought I would give myself to someone again, after jake...Jake who had brought me new experiences..then broke my heart cause he didn't think he could handle a long distance relationship.  I don't hate him, like my firends do, but I don't...do I still care for him? Probably not since I haven't seen him for 4 yrs.  I thought I was done with it..I was hoping I could get to college before falling again..but B popped into my life....still yummy though. When I'm with B, I'm happy.  Kat think's I[m pure..B probably does too, but I"ve locked a night on a tramp away in the back of my mind..that was something of a mistake..something I"ll never forget..but keep locked up for as long as I can.  Dare I tell him all that I've felt, think, and know? Yes...I should.  It's something I know I need to do.  I emailed him...I'm afraid he'l turn away form what I wrote..I wanted him to know where I stand and how I feel, but when I reread it after I sent it, it sounded like I was pleading for something.  Maybe it was the way I read it or even how I felt at the time.  I'm not confused, or well, not as much as i was before.  Now?  Now I feel..crushed and denied my heart's desire...yeah..I can live with or without B...I can forget what happened and move on...but I'll have felt like I missed something in my life.  Yay!  plaing a LAN for Jan 24-25 :) B is hopefully coming down!  Sooo happyl, but I still need to convince my mom..but I"m sure I can do taht.  Anyway..B and I fixed our relationship :P we're not forgeting what happened but working off of it...Like getting to know eachother better.  LOL Friends with bennifits! Conley got asked out by Dane...FINALLY!! Geez, took him long enough :) but hey, it's soo cool and a really happy atmosphere. 0.o found out mylo is REALLY serious about Kat.  It's cool to know it, but I'm wondering how it'll work out.  It's sweet people can just click like that.  I'm happy for them both and really hope it works out between them. :D So..here I am, in a second class of Math :P listening to Kat'sl iPod (redhot, under the bridge)  It's fun not going to CAM..not that I would've been doing anything different in the first place.  But, hey, oh well :) test today...yuck :P  ---------------Breath Break :P Can't Believe How Much I've Written These Last Couple Of Days :) Okay, Done :D Back To Finishing Entering These---------------  Ok...I don't know if it's a good thing, but B is coming down this weekend...I thought I'd be more excited about it..maybe it just hasn't registeredyet. Kat is wanting to do a Double Date..her and mylo, me and B.  I think it would be cool to do, but I got to get B out and do it.  I think we might end up doing lunch and moive, or dinner and movie...we'll see. Finished taking my math test.  It was unexcting.  I thought it was going to be really hard, but I just went thorught it reallly fast. :P Either I knew what I was doing or I learned nothing and just wrote stuff down...I'm hoping it's the first. Anyway, dad has really stressed to LaDonna that he just wants to be freidns for now.  I feel bad about that because I really like her...then it give me the chanve with B... ...shoudln't think about him.  HOme is alreayd depressed..with mom telling me I need to change and spend more time with her...I found it easier to be aorund her when my parents were together, and now I hate spending time with ehr...just the opposite with my dad..How did that happen?  Maybe because i've gottent he chanve to one on one with noth of them, and found out things I liked and didn't like.  La la la....in CAM like usual.  Nothing is really going on.  Tomorrow I'll ahve to finish the rest of my drwings and turn them in.  Oh well.  Most of the time we screw off and have fun.  I do enjou what i've learned thought. :) it's fun. So, Brad was supposed to come down last weekend, but LaD, said no less then 24 hrs before my dad was supposed to pick him up..I want to know why.  She says it's because of money issues...BS!!  It could also be ebcause my dad broke it off with her... ...I dunno.  I'ts something thought.  Hopefully, or well I'm gonna try to get Brad up here this weekend, but only if he wants to. God..I played CS ALL WEEKEND!! instead of doing my hw like I was supposed to...smart move...I met some cool guys, and now I'm consent on one server with them...it's great cause I'm one of the 9 girls that play there, and I'm the youngest one (not all of them know that though :D)  I tried getting Tanya to dl Steam 1.6 for her CS files, but she kept shutting it down so it hasn't finished yet...I'm going to try to get mom to do it while we are at lessons today. Wow...my thoughts are back at Brad...I really need to stop thinking about him.  Where do I want to go with him?  I want him to he as happy as he can be, so I'm not going to push anything, even though I want to.    everything is soo confusing right now.  Not hard, just can't really make sense of my feelings and what I want...Oh well...it'll take time, but I'll work through it.  ---------------Right, I'm done now :P there's more, but it's all repetitive, so I'm not going to type it :D my hands hurt.---------------
