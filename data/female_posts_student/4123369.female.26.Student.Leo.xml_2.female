Still not a word, I copy pasted some points. Hope I can start writing from there. Cough's getting better less aggressive. Getting slimmer too. From 36 inches, to 33 inches. By tomorrow I had to complete my napster report or the online flower shop evaluation. And start on the CA part b report on bad online flower shops........ Means I have to reach school by 1pm. 4 hours should be sufficient, I hope. Haiz got to go. Really have to start on the contests le.
