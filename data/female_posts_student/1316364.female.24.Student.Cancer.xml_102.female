I had gone there for one thing only, a food saver vacuum sealer that was on sale for $59.99 (org. $112.99) I figured it would be a very useful thing for me to use to send Jesse cookies and such, all vacuumed sealed and kept fresh. Just as I was getting ready to leave the store my cell phone rang, I ignored it because I was very busy with checking out. Once we got to the care I check the message. It was from my friend Dale asking me to give him a call when I got a chance because he wanted to know about our plans for the weekend. I didn’t call him back because I was on my way to Mel’s Diner (a 60’s style Hamburger Joint) for dinner with my mom and I figured I could call him when I got home. While I was eating he called again and after him there were two calls from his ex, my other friend, Paul. All this time I was just trying to eat dinner with my mom.   A very, very, very long story short, Dale was upset because my friend Ronnie (who just returned to Sacramento after being stationed in Korea for the greater portion of 2 years) said something that offended Dale… something like that. We were all supposed to meet up on Saturday and have a great fun time at a local Gay Pride Festival, both Dale, Paul and Ronnie, plus several other people I know from my old neighborhood are gay. I guess it comes with the territory; Downtown Sacramento has a very strong Gay population. Any way, we were supposed to go to this festival tomorrow and now, because of what Ronnie said to Dale, Dale doesn’t want to go. I feel that this is entirely my fault because some how, like always, I got pulled in the middle of this. I had told Ronnie that Dale really liked him and that all he could do was talk about how nice and cute and such, on and on for the greater portion of an hour or so. I told Ronnie this because I thought that he should know that Dale had these feelings for him. I didn’t think that this was anything that Ronnie hadn’t figured out on his own.   Well anyway, so now I am in the middle of a dispute between my friend Dale and Ronnie, whom I have know for as long as I have know Jesse.   Damn it Jesse why did you have to go overseas, I need you now…. I don’t know what to do…. Help!!!  I think I am going to keep my mouth shut from now on.  *hummm mmhll mhhhee hmm hhiiinnnss mhhum mmuutt* That is, "we will see how things turn out"- with my mouth Shut :-)
