You'd think I'd learn after the first time.  I basically hurt one person that actually cared about me... only because I cared about them and for some reason, I was uncomfortable with that.  Fuck I don't even know what I'm talking about really.  My own thoughts don't make any sense to me sometimes.  The other was Aaron.  I KNOW.  It was for the best... I keep trying to tell myself that.  I couldn't just go out with him tonight because we had these plans 2 fucking months ago.  He was all upset but really, I haven't seen him in weeks, did he really expect us to go to this movie together?  He got all pissy about it but, even when we were together, he fucking FORGOT about our plans to go see Dodgeball opening day.  I don't regret telling him I wasn't going with him tonight.  I'm glad I didn't go.  I just always hate it when I upset people.  It's just the way I am.  I don't like knowing he was pissed off at me, even though I don't fucking care.   I don't even know why I'm wasting my thoughts on this.  It's stupid.  Anyway, after suffering a mind-circus with all this, I went out anyway with Kate, Megan and Rhea and we all saw King Arthur (yes, my second time) and it was just as good as when I saw it two nights ago... hehe.  I really like going to movie theatres; especially the one at Grant Park... it's so classic looking and if you go on Friday or Saturday nights, it's so crowded.  Ah, love it.  I'm not even upset about earlier anymore, I feel kind of at peace just in this moment.  I personally think it has something to do with Sean.       It has everything to do with Sean.
