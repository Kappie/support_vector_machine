YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.  She's crazy.  She has even tracked one of the singers down in his cabin. How retarded.  Anyway, things are running smoothly. The last 2 weeks cruise the weather was bad. we had storms in all of our ports and rain as well. I enjoyed it to be honest as it had been almost 2 months since I had seen any.  I am very excited about getting into San Diego tomorrow. Two guests that have sailed with me preivously are meeting me at the terminal and we are going for lunch.  Just wonderful people - Kat  Ed.  Edis a photographer for Better Homes  Gardens and Kat is a pilot. She emailed me today and wanted to know if I could get away for a bit. I accepted certainly!  I am definitely settling into this ship life now. Starting to become even more familar with our 10/11 day cruises - just the way things go and schedule of events etc.  i had a conference call with our Miami office last week and they outlined quite a bit of changes for my position which i am very excited about. Right now I am spending about 5 hours a day in the office doing invitations, administrative work and because they want me out in th public all the time - they are giving me an assistant to handle my administrative work. I am super excited about this because it will allow me more opportunities to throw parties and host events with my guests. Yippee!  Let's see what else new - oh I got a raise. Pretty cool. Let's just say ECI can take that 3 1/2 percent and shove it - because after being here for less than 2 months, I have just received a raise times 5 of that percent. Jerkoffs. It's amazing to me how some companies can treat their employees like slaves. At least here, we want to be here and enjoy our job!   Well, I am off to the dining hall now. best to everyone. smooches!  shelly
