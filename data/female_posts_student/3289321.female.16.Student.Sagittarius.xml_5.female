But there are a certain few that, without them, life would be bland and somewhat empty.  I just don't know.  Well, I'm gonna get off here and go do some thinking.   Lyrics of the moment:  Everything I have in mind It begins to fade away I searched for it and I longed for it And now I know it's gone Everything has slipped away And I'm so overwhelmed Everything that rests upon my shoulders fell I would like to tell anyone who has depended on me for themselves, I'm sorry And everyone I've held in my arms I believed I've pushed away I would be there if I could be there But as it stands, I'm gone Everyone has slipped away Don't be overwhelmed Everyone that loved me more than I could tell, I'm sorry There's a private hell for anyone who lives to only love themselves Everyone has slipped away Everyone has slipped away Everyone has slipped away Everything has slipped away  ^The Juliana Theory - "As It Stands"   Later  >
