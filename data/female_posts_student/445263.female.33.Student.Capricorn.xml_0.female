I failed a lung function test quite spectacularly yesterday and now have an inhaler and an appointment to see the doctor in three weeks. In other news...my mobile is buggering around (or is it Yahoo's wap site?) and my phone locks up and switches off when I thy and access my emails. So it's probably not worth anyone emailing of over the next couple of weeks. And we are setting of for hols in Cromer very soon!
