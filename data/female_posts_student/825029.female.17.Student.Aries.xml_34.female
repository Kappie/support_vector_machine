It makes me suicidal genocidal it blows my mind to the point of *Screams* i dont know... but.... hell.  my God is not some fucking being that is anywhere near our comprehension.  people believe that somehow the concept of God can somehow be contained in our minds.  and also with little effort.  i hate you people.  and i hate myself for being one of you.  hell... the word hate doesnt even have any meaning... your rules your God and Jesus... the most important things in your lives... encompass nearly nothing of the big picture.  there is no satisfying the greed and pride of man.  he believes he can explain and know all things... you can never know God that is the fucking definition of God.  The one thing that created(s) all things...that encompasses all things... shit im talking too much.  this started off in my profile but i ran out of room and i havent updated my blog in forever so... could you just please accept the possibility that you have no fucking clue??? there are so many possibilities you just... throw to the wind for your "God"  if the God you speak of is the one you believe to be the most important thing in existance... its but a speck on the map. ill stop talking about God... its not really religious, its a concept that affects us all because we cannot deny it.  however you want to think of God it is there.  even if you think we are all there is and science rules all or anything... all being and existence itself is included in "God" so to disprove God you must disprove your own existence which is impossible.   anyway... my original point was that... if we cannot choose our personalities and actions truly since we are product of things beyond our control, how can we be held accountable for anything?  we really.. cant.  but we still judge each other and kill each other etc.  i mean... there is really nothing that is truly bad.  Something that we view as wrong is just... sure it may be painful but what is pain? what is sadness? they are no more than imaginary feelings within the confines of our material bodies.  bad and good are both... just... different things.  just because they are... "dangerous to the preservation of life and happiness" etc... doesnt make them... "bad" in the eyes of all things combined.  they are just unwanted by us.  make up a believe creature in your mind that enjoys all the things we hate, and then try to prove that the people you see around you are different or more real than the creature you created.  they arent.  just because the creature you created in your mind does not affect you physically and directly as other "real" people do, does not make it less real.  just because you cant see it doesnt mean it doesnt exist, i guess is what im trying to say.  ok im gonna stop... i just wanted to bring up the point that we are all the same damn person, just under different cirumstances.  we have different sized heads, brains, hair color, texture, skin color, birth place, customs, etc.  so next time you judge someone or label them, just remember thats you.    you are condemning yourself as other you's have condemned you.  just give it thought and maybe our race will progress a little.  and eventually somehow rise above what we are... and maybe we will someday accept our futility and yet intricate importance without squandering our thoughts on such simple ideas and terms as we do daily... for the sake of "happiness"  you are me and i am you. cool huh? sorry for the typos, i was writing in black on black. --words of charles.  just as useless or important as any others...
