I closed The Alhambra down at DtC because I can't put any effort into it anymore, so I'm enjoying chasing around the messageboard trying to up Megs on my post count haha...  I have no life.  I wrote my Social "Is war ever justifiable" essay the other day... it sucked MAJORLY!!... My key quote was from John Lennon of all people.. "If people demanded peace instead of a new television set, then there'd be peace." really bad... but oooh well..  I have a dentist appointment tomorrow inbetween classes (hooray for that, eh?) But its also supposed to snow tomorrow (weeeird stuff.. snow.. May.. uggh..) but then again.. we were supposed to have a thunder storm today.. and I'm still waiting on that...  What else........ oooh.. I haven't heard from GMC.. still yet....... grrr... but I have my appointment at MHC on Friday at 11:00 am... sooo we'll see if the going away for college is gonna be okay for me... (I'm seriously undecided now....)  I think thats about it for now.... Watch out.. hamsters are going to take over the world!!!
