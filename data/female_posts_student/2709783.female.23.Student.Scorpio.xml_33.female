I avoid them like the plague, but today, an unusual confluence of circumstances forced me to patronize one.  Circumstances being that I was really, really in the mood for some new rock and roll, combined with the fact that I don’t know my way around Cleburne that well, and Wal-Mart was the only place I could get to that sold CDs.     So I bobbed and weaved through racks of Dale Earnhardt, Jr., paraphernalia and made it to the media section, where I searched for something to fit my mood.  Due to the sudden blog popularity of the Beastie Boys, I picked up their newest.  I made my way to the front of the store, where I waited in the express lane line near a display of aluminum implements that help you insert a can of beer up a chicken’s ass.  They should really test the manual dexterity of cashiers before assigning them to a high-pressure position like “Express Lane.”  After taking 15 minutes to check out 3 people who each had an average of 2 items, the girl sort of apologized to #1 Tony Stewart fan, who was in front of me, by saying, “I never work in this part.”  No shit?  She then spent another 3 minutes searching for a carton of the special kind of Marlboros that Tony’s biggest supporter wanted, while the woman said repeatedly, “They’re right there.  No, there.  Over here.”   I wanted to yell, “Next to the Reds, dumbass!” but I’m trying to be nice to service industry employees in order to lessen my karmic debt from the Taco Bell thing.  On my way out of the store, a red-headed kid who weighed at least 150 lbs. stepped on my foot.  His mother immediately began beating him, which made me laugh out loud.  Not because I’m a child abuser, but because it reminded me of the story Sabrina was telling me last night.  I didn’t take the time to explain this to the lady, who gave me a dirty look even while she was smacking her 8-year-old.    I get in my pickup, only mildly frustrated, and pop in the CD.  Guess what?  It’s the fucking edited version.  I know, I should have checked first, and what was I thinking, buying a CD that didn’t have the “Explicit Lyrics” label on it, but damn, I was pissed.   Music just isn’t the same if you can’t hear all of the obscenities.  So I’ve vowed to not set foot into a Wal-Mart for as long as I possibly can.  Everything I could possibly need from that hellhole can be obtained at Target, HEB, and Dicorte’s.   Except maybe the chicken sodomizer.  All of this frustration could be indicative of a larger problem.  I have begun to reconsider Sabrina’s “now that you’re single, you need to get back on the horse as quickly as possible” advice (or some animal metaphor).  Wait, hers has something to do with a racetrack.  Anyway, I’m considering it not because I think that it’s particularly good advice, but instead because I think my lack of a horse is beginning to manifest itself in my moods.  Two good friends have suggested that I’m a little testier than normal, also supported by the above events; they passed along ways to remedy this grouchiness that I won’t repeat here because this is a family blog.  The kicker is that my own mother, to whom I repeated Sabrina’s suggestion so that she could reassure me it was not a wise choice, said, “Well, that’s not a bad idea.”  Me:  “Mom, you’re not supposed to say that.”  Mom:  “It might help.”    If your own mother thinks you’re so irritable that she condones out-of-wedlock relations, I can only imagine how pissy I must seem to friends who are not bound by blood to put up with me.
