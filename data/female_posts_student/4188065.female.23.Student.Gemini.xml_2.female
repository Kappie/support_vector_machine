Registration to comment indeed! I've gone along with it, but I've taken umbrage.  As you can see, I've broken down and registered. But be it known that I only did so because I wanted to be able to post comments on other people's blogs and couldn't unless I got a Blogger name of my own. I was happy that my web nomme de plume wasn't taken.  One of us, one of us, gabba, gabba, we accept you...  Yeah, I know. I'm the only one who's seen "Freaks." Oh well.  Vive Live Journal! Vive Quebec! Vive Jay Sherman!  I'll stop now.
