Actually, I think we should just embrace panty lines as a fashion statement, just like the women in those  urlLink fake painted butt skirts .   I do know lots of people who take panty lines  very seriously , as well as someone(who shall remain nameless) who has to go commando in movie theaters for fear of a wedgie that can't be wiggled away. The wiggle-free (and much more polite) solution is the  urlLink Anti-Panti . These are 100% cotton, disposable, crotch-only stick-ons for your tightest jeans and sheerest pants. You can get a package of 5 for $10, in lots of kitschy patterns like camouflage. One size fits all.  Buy the thong-begone at  urlLink Shop Intuition .
