Typically I just let my fingers do the typing and don't go back and change things.  Oftentimes I'll type things that I didn't know were residing in my mind, and they'll just spill out on to the screen.  I most of what I type seems removed and distant, or a least not personal, at least not at the time that I post.  Looking back though, there are things that I don't want the entire world to know here, on these pages.  That thought makes me nervous in some way, simply because I don't know exactly who reads this.  The knowledge wouldn't change what I write (I hope) but would be interesting to know.
