Once you feel your first "runner's high", your first pain where you thought you'd never hurt, you become masochistic. But its not always about how you feel, its about the people you meet and the friendships you make. Running becomes instilled in you, and you realize your legs, and your life, will never be the same.          If you do well, win races and achieve personal bests, that's one of the best feelings in the world. But no matter how well you do, it will always comes down to the fact that you love running. Well, I'll be more specific, I know I love running for my team. I love the camaraderie of my fellow runners and I love the support I receive from my teammates everyday. Track is the only sport where you have something in common with everyone-- you all run, you all feel pain, and, most importantly, you're all set out to do one thing: RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. It doesn't matter if you're a sprinter, a middie, or a distance runner, your goal for each race is to run faster than the previous one. A baseball or football player can't say a pitcher and a left-fielder or a quarterback and a right-tackle share a common goal. Sure they all want to win the most games they can, but that's everyone's goal, every sports team wants to win.          Most people hate to run. As my team says regularly, "Our sport is your sport's punishment". No one wants to run laps except us. No one gets excited about warming up around a field except us. But why do we do it? Why do we put our bodies through such a rigorous test of guts and stamina?          Its tough to say why though, and its even harder to explain to a non-runner. During any intense running, may that be racing or doing a speed workout, you start to feel numb. First its your quads, then your lower legs, then your arms, and soon your whole body is tingling in over-exertion. But even how painful this might be, you run on, to prove to yourself, or even to others, that you are not going to give up, you are not a quitter. The weaknesses start to show, your form loses all correctness, but you flail your arms and you pump your legs just so you can reach the finish line and say to yourself, "I know I can do better". Which is true, amazingly, because it doesn't matter if you feel like you're going to drop dead when you immediately stop running. You know five, ten minutes later your breathing will be back to normal and your legs will feel fatigued, but you can still walk and even cool down. So you wait till the next race when you can try to beat your only true enemy-- yourself.          That is a runner at its best, when quitting is never an option and improving is only twenty-four two-hundreds or five tempo miles away. All runners know this feeling, all runners know deep down they're not giving it all they have. Now the question I have for you: Is it in  you ?
