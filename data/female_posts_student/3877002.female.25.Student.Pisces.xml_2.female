I really don't want my blog to be a catalog of my pet peeves but it's been one of those days. And my top annoying item of the day would have to be people getting angry for no good reason. For instance, there is a guy in my class who gets almost personally offended anytime our professor lectures on formatting our papers according to MLA format.  I certainly understand it's boring but why all the sighing, moaning, and shuffling of books?  In my opinion, people should really reserve that kind of righteous indignation for things that are truly wrong - like  urlLink Lindsay Lohan   getting a recording deal,  urlLink Joan  Melissa Rivers defecting from E! to the TV Guide channel  , and Jessica Simpson's mom in the recent issue of  urlLink Vanity Fair  claiming that Jessica's IQ is "like,160. And, you know, that's like a genius level."   Ah, so much celebrity bashing to do, so little time.    Okay well since I kind of disparaged Miss Lohan, I guess my props for today will go out to Hilary.   (I'm very bipolar when it comes to my adoration of teen celebrities.....)
