In San Francisco, Mayor Gavin Newsom allowed gay marriages starting Feb. 12 until the California Supreme Court voted unanimously that they should stop a month later. Massachusetts is slated to allow same-sex marriages as of May 17 and several other states have domestic partner laws, reciprocal beneficiary laws and civil unions that grant the couples some legal rights.   But whether or not traditional marriage should be challenged is another matter entirely.  The position of conservatives on the issue of gay marriage is clear: it should not be legalized, because marriage should only be between a man and a woman. The underlying reason for this is the thinking that homosexuality in itself is wrong. Many people go around spouting this creed, but the reasons behind it aren't so commonly heard. Because of this, there are plenty of misconceptions floating around regarding this stance on gay marriage and homosexuality in general.  The majority of the conservative populace backs religious traditions as their reasons why gay marriages should remain illegal. The “religious right” is accused by gay activists of being vile, hateful bigots who ignore one of the basic fundamentals of Christianity: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” As it is a commandment, Christians are expected to follow it, and when Christians speak out against homosexuality and gay marriage, the gay community immediately reminds them of it. But there is a difference between loving someone and condoning their actions.   “Love the sinner, hate the sin.” It seems simple enough, doesn’t it? Sometimes it seems like all Christians do is confuse “hate the sin” with “hate the sinner.” There are some Christians who are misguided and a little forgetful when it comes to the topic of loving their neighbor, but just because many of those vocal on the conservative side of this issue give the impression that they hate the sinner because of the sin does not make it God’s truth. To find God’s truth, Christians should look to the Bible, and the Bible is very clear on the subject.  In Genesis 2:24, it says “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” Clearly, this verse is not leaving any room for homosexual unions. It’s not only saying that man and woman were created to be united together. It’s saying that a man will leave his father and mother, not father and father, or mother and mother. This verse is where God declares that his idea of a family consists of a man and a woman. Anything else is not what he intended for his beloved creation.  In Romans 1: 26-27, the Apostle Paul writes “For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.” This verse is saying that homosexuality is not natural, or that they aren’t “born that way.” Reason being, early on (very early on… we’re talking, the Earth is only a week or so old) God said that man was created to be with a woman back in Genesis 2.   What is marriage for? Maggie Gallagher, President of the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy and a co-author of The Case for Marriage, wrote a column for The Weekly Standard in August of 2003. She writes that if family structure doesn’t matter, if a family can function on love alone regardless of the sexes of the parents, “Then what is marriage for? Why have laws about it? Why care whether people get married or stay married? Do children need mothers and fathers, or will any sort of family do? When the sexual desires of adults clash with the interests of children, which carries more weight, socially and legally?” She goes on to say that “marriage is a virtually universal human institution. In all the wildly rich and various cultures flung throughout the ecosphere, in society after society, whether tribal or complex, and however bizarre, human beings have created systems of publicly approved sexual union between men and women that entail well-defined responsibilities of mothers and fathers. Not all these marriage systems look like our own, which is rooted in a fusion of Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian culture. Yet everywhere, in isolated mountain valleys, parched deserts, jungle thickets, and broad plains, people have come up with some version of this thing called marriage.”   When God created humans, part of his plan was for them to make more humans (“As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it” Gen. 9:7), and the only way to do this is through a male and female relationship. If homosexuality was truly natural, we would have discovered it long ago. There would be no need for a “sexual revolution.” The belief of Christian conservatives that is rarely given voice is that the “I’m born this way” argument is used  by the gay community to justify their actions. Every human who has ever lived save one was born with a sin nature, and that single person without one lived two thousand years ago and is the founder of the Christian faith, Jesus of Nazareth, who, according to the Bible, lived a perfect life. This built in sin nature is why many Christians confuse the concept of “hate the sin, love the sinner” with “hate the sinner because he sins.” This thinking is flawed – no one is perfect. Everyone sins. We’re born that way. But God’s truth is, we don’t have to stay that way.   ~  I wrote this for the ThunderRidge Newspaper. It was published last Friday.
