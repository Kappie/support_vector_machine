Well, because someone said to me, "You know, you should really try spending an entire night with a man. You'd like it, it's nice." So, of course, not to deviate from the response people the world over who know me would expect, I said, "Oh, come on. Don't make me listen to that shit right now. I'm really not in the mood." A little bitchy, I know, but I meant it to be.  First, because it really was a bad time for her to be gushing (especially to me) about her current fling because I was way too busy madly packing up my apartment, working inside an impossible timetable. Second, because I feel like some things are too intimate to share with everyone. Granted, this woman and I are close--relatives, actually--but I've never told her anything  really  dear about myself and any man I've ever...um...I don't know...anything-ed. Whatever it is I do with men.  See, that's the thing, and where, I believe, I prevent myself from getting some of the things I want. There really haven't been that many intimate things with men. There have been sordid things. There have been hilarious things. There have been exhausting things. There have been sweet things. All things  done  with, though. I only ever  do  things with men--and I say things because that's what I mean. Trust that if I meant I was indiscriminately fucking men all over the southeast, I'd say so--would chat up anyone who would listen about it, in fact. Kidding. Sort of. But, no. I say do things just because it includes everything--all the whatevers you could do with a man you were sexually attracted to. Like date, or kiss, or touch, or massage, or have sex with--everything. And that's all. Never, ever anything so intimate I felt like a piece of the life the gods meant for me to live had finally come to fruition. Only ever the superficial. Why? Well, why do you think? Let's list, shall we...  -Mortally afraid of anything deeper -Am allergic to discussions of matrimony -Become queasy during commitment-speak -Am quite a picky little girl -Love intelligence that doesn't always have to be validated -Get bored really quickly if he's...well, stupid -Get bored really quickly if he isn't an artist, of some kind -Can tell immediately if his interest is just physical...and it almost always is...and so my own, if I choose to date him, can never be more than that (turn about's fair play) -This one is awful, I know...still...generally, men are guilty until proven innocent--in my mind. I've seen them in action, I know what the worst sort are all about. I've seen soooooooo much atrocity--such cruelty--and can only speak as I have seen -Putting a shattered heart back together again is an impossible business. Takes forever. I never want to do that again. -I only ever REALLY want the ones I could never/should never have (my best/truest friend says this is consciously done) -It's easier to do it this way.  ...et cetera, et cetera...  And here is the kicker. I believe in love such as I have never seen before, so I don't think that it's possible. I don't think anyone ever really ends up with the person whom they crave  most , the one who makes their skin tingle, around whom they lose their breath, whose eyes say everything they ever wanted to hear, whose touch is absolutely perfect, no matter how or where they do it...mmmm. Picky, see? And I don't ever want to settle.  So, I've never, ever had a serious relationship. I'm not nearly ready...well, tonight I am. I'd murder,  tonight , to instantaneously be six months into something with someone whose kiss still makes my tummy squirm and my legs ease open...do you understand? Yeah, but, god, I don't think I'm built to do the work it takes to get to that place. I'd find some reason to sack him before I started to need him...and even if I did end up needing him, I'm stubborn enough to deny myself until I forget what it is he has that I want/need so desperately...but that's a whole other issue...some other time.  So, tonight would be perfect if I fell asleep, woke to the sound of my lover...mmmmmm...my lover...using his key to come in. He'd get a drink of water, take a piss (shaking off excess properly), get undressed, get into bed with me, wrap himself around me, kiss my neck just behind my ear...and love me. However that would manifest.  But that's just how I feel tonight. Tomorrow I will probably actively seek to verbally castrate three men...at least. Punish them for punishing me. Because I want them so badly, sometimes, though I despise some of their sex with venom such as...too tired to complete the simile.  All right. There's that. Such a complex history. Will probably never be reconciled. Off to bed, alone, then. Aside from the comfort I can provide for myself...which, my god, doesn't even begin to compare.
