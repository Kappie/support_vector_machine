Did some bread cutting, went to get the meat/cheese/soup (first time... guess I 'graduated') and did serving for our biggest crowd since I started in January.  No rhyme or reason for it... after Welfare Wednesdays we have a really big crowd but it falls off towards the end of the month.  Somewhat odd.  Slept and watched TV this afternoon.  Don't tell my sup.  More to come...
