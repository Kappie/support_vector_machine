Life hasn't been that good lately, and not having anything to do doesn't make it any better...I had to work tonight...that was fun...NOT! Usually the people that I close w/ are in good moods and we have so much fun closing together, but everyone was tired and      y, and just wanted to get out of there...so we didn't have much fun, and there defin. wasn't much talking going on. So in other words, it was long and BORING...the story of my life! But anywhoo...I just got an email from my friend saying that he made it to Cali. (He is moving there forever from here.) It was good to hear from him, but I wish he was still here...oh well, life doesn't always work out how we want it to, Obviously! Speaking of life...I just want everything to work itself out, w/out me in it....blah! Okay, I'm going to bed...I can't talk anymore, its not making sense.
