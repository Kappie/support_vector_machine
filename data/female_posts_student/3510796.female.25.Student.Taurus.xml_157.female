I was going to study, but then I remembered that the test was going to be a take home test. I really dont need to study for something like that. I fell asleep fast and woke up early again. Can't sleep in when breakfast needs to be served.        Tonight is the night! Finally going to catch the flick! Going with Superfly, Cam and 'Halle Berry'. Might end up at The Bar, who knows.        I've posted in the past about the bad stuff that goes on around here, and this time I thought I would post this   urlLink  article from the paper today.    I always like to see young kids doing something good with their time rather than getting into trouble. But thereare also the articles that make it tough to be a mom or a even a dad for that matter.   urlLink  July has been the deadliest month for traffic fatalities in St. Joseph County since 2000.    Part of this article will also say that the two boys on their mopeds, both 15, had been drinking before the accident. One was over the legal limit, which is .08 in Indiana. The guy who allegedly crossed the center line tested positive for marijuana, but speaking from experience, alcohol impairs your judgment a lot worse than marijuana. I am NOT saying the driver of the truck wasn't at fault, but with no witnesses, no one knows what actually happened. I'll be sure to keep you informed on the outcome.
