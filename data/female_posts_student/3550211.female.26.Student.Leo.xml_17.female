You know, I never told you this, but I had such a crush on you. I thought you were so cute, and so much fun. But the fact that you were one of my best friends little brothers, well, I just didn't see it right to tell you how I felt. The three of us had some pretty good times together though. I remember one of the last times I saw you. Your parents were gone, and you and your sister threw a party. It was pretty wild, and you got pretty drunk. In fact, you passed out in the upstairs bathroom. I saw you in there and wet a washcloth and washed you up with it. I wonder if you ever knew I did that. You always had such a sweet angelic face. Your death has always seemed so wrong to me. It just isn't fair. With so many horrible people in this world, why would it be "your" time to go? You, who was so vibrant, so full of life. I know it was a foolish accident, a mistake on your part. But, for me, that is no justification. It's not a good enough reason for me to accept why you, of all people, died.  One of the last times I talked to your sister, she told me that she saw you. That she had spoken to you. The depth of her despair worried me so much. I told her you were probably watching over her. That you, in death, had become her guardian angel. I'd like to think that you still are. Well, my dear, perhaps one day we will meet again. But until then, you will live on forever in the hearts of those who had the honor and privilege to know you.  May you rest in peace. Love forever, Jennifer.
