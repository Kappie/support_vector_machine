For those of you that might not be in the know, New York State and Suffolk county has issued a cell phone ban while driving a car.  The lady officer informed me of why I was pulled over.  It didnt occur to me that they would be flagging down drivers at such a late hour - which was 1 am!  I got a summons for 175 smakaroons and a word of advice from the officer to get a hands free device.  I thanked her for her concerns and drove home.  Got home and reading e-mail I got this offer for the newest hands free device in circulation.  check it out!!!
