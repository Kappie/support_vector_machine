Okay, okay, I've been watching Tomb Raider way too much, but I love that quote from it. I love those movies (should've put them on the list), and I love how much of a badass Angelina Jolie is as Lara Croft. Another heroine I admire is Wonder Woman, have since I was a little girl. Talk about strong and beautiful women. ThoughLara isa bit waify in that movie,and Wonder Woman is a cartoonthey give me a body and character image thatI wouldn't mind working toward. Sexy, beautiful,smart, strong, observant, ingenious, etc. Okay maybe I just really like these characters way too much, dunno, but I'd take it. Though I know I possesa few of those qualities, I wouldn't mind striving for a body like either one. Although, I am fully aware that they are fiction, and have fictional proportions.   Thank goodness I'm almost backdown to my pre-summer weight and fitness level. All those cheeseburgers, pizza, greasy fast food, no more thank you. I'm going to beef up my workout regime, pick out a few more evening classes to attend, and really watch my diet. I'd ideally like to get down another 10lbs.and tone up a bit more,I know I can do it. Right now I do yoga and step aerobics each once a week and supplement two more days of cardio and weight training fortwo hours per day. I just really need to get a regime I can stick to during my student teaching craziness. That will be key.   Alright enough ranting about my workout plans, I promise. It is just that I'm feeling so excited and ready to focus myself on me and what I want to do right now that I just can't help it. I'm just feeling empowered lately with my new freedom, and all the stuff happening in my life right now.
