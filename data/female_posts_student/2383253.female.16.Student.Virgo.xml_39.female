You guys I just finished this book by Al Franken,  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them:  A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right. Please borrow it from me. You'll love it...this guy is incredibly good.  Matt, congrats on winning first in the nation! I'm so proud of you people :-) Yeah we really should go to Fashion Valley more often. With you, Fratt Manks. You need our help to get summer clothing.  You guys...we must get to the beach. It's supposed to be very nice and sunny for this week. Mff, not too much time to write right now. Will post later. Guests coming over. Cya.
