Team owner John claims "with a lineup featuring Glaus, Branyan, Cirllio, Catalanotto, Aurilia, and Greg Colbrunn there's definite power on this team." Tim Naehring, Travis Fryman and Robb Quinlan expect to be key players off the bench for the team.      This kind of sitting around will not be tolerated in Anaheim this season   Alfredo Almezaga expects to start at second base against left handed pitching, Brian Roberts against righties. It is uncertain who will play center for the team yet as there's no one who's ever played a game in center on the roster. One guess had been Frank Catalanotto but he's better suited for a position in one of the corner outfield spots.   The team is also noticeably lacking in pitching. The rotation is comprised of Bud Black, Ismael Valdes, Chan Ho Park, Joe Kennedy and Danys Baez. Mike Bielecki expects to get considerable work as a long reliever and the back end of the pen is pretty solid featuring Brad Lidge, Ricardo Rincon, and David Riske. The question is whether this team will be able to get the ball into their hands. The Angels plan to carry 11 pitchers so they will undoubtedly need to acquire a few more arms to fill out the bullpen.   The team has been eyeing Dustin Hermanson, William Van Landingham, Casey Fossum, Chris Carpenter, Scott Kaminecki, Mark Guthrie and Brian Boehringer as possible late round additions. The team has not ruled out a possible trade later for arm.
