I find men are great as friends especially with my personality type (I can't stand girlie females) (Does that make me an Alicia Keys type?) but when you start dating them, your expectations of them rise and consequently they start pissing you off.  I'm not at all implying that it's the man's fault....we just interpret each others actions differently....It's the truth....not only because Simone says so but because Dr Phil McGraw did (Oprah show).  What men perceive to be nagging is more likely a demonstration of love (right now you're like... What is this bitch talking about??).  Think of parenting, I remember just hating my mother from the ages of 7 to 14 (the discipline years) but now I understand why she did what she did!  Only stupid men don't watch Oprah, her show is like a language translation device for “Oestrogen” a language most men do not understand.  Women do not need to watch any show to understand men because the ancient language of "Testosterone" (well according to Chris Rock) is based on three simple phrases, Feed me, Fuck me  Shut the fuck Up  :0)  I can only speak for myself but I've stopped listening to what people say because words mean nothing, people will demonstrate their feelings towards you.  So a fight means nothing unless she stabs you in your sleep which means " I hate you and I want you dead" (you see, actions speak volumes).  Start worrying with you reach that very special place in your relationship.   In summary with everything in life you have to look for the positives and arguing adds some dramatic excitement to the day and the best part of all is the make-up sex :0)
