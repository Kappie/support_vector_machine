Vin Diesel? Or ,,,some dirty minds ...?? Weekekekeek ¬.¬ Just admit it!  Mmm... it's not about those things. Triple X at my school is kind of  workshop that my school hold for spending our spare time properly before our holiday start.   Xplore,Xperiment,Xperience -> yah dunno the right order, but it does contain those words! Wekekekeke   (We've finished our final exams last June 2) Our principal thinks it's a very good way for us to study some more, something different with general studies we have in class like math, social studies, physics, or chemistry isntead of wandering in malls.  At first, i thought it's going to be a boring one, just like our journalism workshop. But it was't boring at all, yah.. it wasn't very interesting too, but it's good i say.  I'll tell u more later on, a skirt to be bought now by me at GaLeri Keris wekekekekekek!!  bayyyyy!!! MwAcKz! --mitoy--
