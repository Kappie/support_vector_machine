It's actually quite depressing, lol. I was talking to Lauren about the possibility of me going to shell island with her, but now Lauren is all quiet and ignoring me (probably not at the the computer) and so I'm bored. I've just realised that I haven't put my quiz on here!! I have made a quiz to find out who you are most like out of me, Lauren, Louise, Rachel and Alison. Most people are Lauren, which is probably because Lauren is more normal than I am. Anyway, my quiz includes pictures of us! Yay! If you wanna take it  urlLink click here . Lauren's back now so I won't write more.  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx
