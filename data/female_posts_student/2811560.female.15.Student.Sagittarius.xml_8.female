In our "sectional", Richie decided to lay down behind the timpani and talk on his cell phone, so John Kasper, Pyde and I went into the hall and played a little. We had fun. Then it was off to east campus and chorale, which was cool because I got to do the solo for Somewhere Over the Rainbow, and I totally belted and it was really good. We played volleyball in gym for the millionith time, but my team was good so it was okay. We just stood there and made fun of Miss Alexander (aka Miss Piggy) the whole time, it was great. And then there was biology in which we had to make Punnet Squares until our eyes and fingers bled. Spanish was fun because we had this sub, and subs are always fun. We watched La Bamba. Finally, we get to watch a movie in English. Anyways, then came algebra, and I had a very large test, which was very easy. I think I got an A. Which I need. In English, we got to watch the Odyssey again. Fun stuff. I will be sooo glad when we're done with Greek Mythology. I hate it! After school, I practiced my duet with Laura, which is awesome. Then Dylan and I talked for like a half an hour while waiting for the bus. And that is a summary of my day. Now I have to go to my Dad's in Glen Ellyn. I've been dreading this weekend just because of how bad last week's was. Michelle and I might do something, so its all good. Call me if you wanna, I'll probably be bored: 942-0998!
