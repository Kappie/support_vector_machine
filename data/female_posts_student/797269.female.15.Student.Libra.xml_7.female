A bunch of trumpet playing, homework doing, kids are having a party with their parents when *gasp* a seemingly innocent game of rugby gets out of hand and a trumpet player, my brother, is tackled. He subsequently bites his lip and ends up in the emergency room getting stitches in his mouth! No more trumpet playing for Forrest, well for a while at least.  I believe I have a very severe case of summeritis. Getting up out of bed to eat or talk on the phone takes a new remarkable amount of energy now. Going to hang out with people or going to things which are supposed to be fun like graduation parties and the movies have become almost impossible tasks. I'm not really sure if it will be possible for me to go back to school in 3 months.  I rented Mystic River and I'm so excited to watch it!
