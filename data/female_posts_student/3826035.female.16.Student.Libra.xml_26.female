Where you know, in your heart, there's somebody for you somewhere. You may not have met them yet, but you feel like you've known them forever. But all you can do is wait patiently and continue to search, or wait for them to come to you.  Super-corny, I know... o O. But thoughts like that have been going through my head for a while now. *grumbles* Stupid dreams... making me think... how dare they...
