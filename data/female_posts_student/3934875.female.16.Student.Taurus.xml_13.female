This Sunday is bloody borringg to me! I havent even started on my hw yet.. Onli done my art folio so far.. And yet, I forgot to do the last page -- Color Scheme. How can i forget man? After packing up my things,realised I havent done a single color scheme for my design. Lols. Actualli,not that i care much.Im bad at art. And I suck at it. So, i hate art. Duh~      Decided to wear my purple kebaya on Tues. Half a mind to wear and half a mind feels like not coming. But at the thought of celebrating it together with my beloved gang of friends for the last time,of cos i would come la. Haf to treasure these last moments.       O man.. I miss working. My friends and I are part-time waitresses at malay wedding banquets on Sundays. It was fun working actually. Aiyah.. I prefer to call it 'helping out'. Our pay's peanuts.. but we don't really care,for now. Hahahz. That reminds me of that bloody Khairul. Thats how i got to know him.       During Syuhadah's aunt's wedding, we were helping out. And khairul was one of the boys working for the caterer's company. Yeahz.. he cooks and all. My other friends noticed him first. Before we even started doing our work. I didnt know who he was.. Only that the other girls refer to him as " Abg Pink". Hahaha. Rites.. How did i actually notice him? Well.. I didnt know he was "Abg Pink". Okok.. The first time i saw him, he was half naked. Only in hix boxers. Just came out of the tent. And we saw each other that way. It was quite funny cos I was carrying the dirty dishes,walking towards the diswashers,who were located behind the tent. And. We actually stopped for a second and stared at each other. For a split second only. And then I just smiled backat him cos he smiled. Actually.. I was smiling bcos his body was not too bad after all. The only turn off was that he's bloody shorter than me by a few cm.. Hahaha.. So,from there, whenever he saw me, he would whistle at me and pretend to look at other things. Im no bimbo..So obviously,I knew he was just teasing me. And I, played on the game as well. Hahaha.. Nana noticed us actually. Soon, he was labelled "Abg Hensem" cos amg all, he was the bes looking la. Hahaha.. There was one point of time, we were resting and sitting down, behind the tent, and Khairul was there. Collecting the washed dishes, i think. I was talking to Raihanah abt the plenty number of guys arnd. And blatantly, I just said " rezeki jgn tolak, musuh jgn carik" All the girls laughed at that comment cos I was like pointing my finger at Khairul who was facing backwards when i said that. They got my cue.. Hahahaha. He heard that. Obviously. So when we finished our work, before we went off, we took a pic with the bride and groom. While queuing up to take the pic, our eyes met again and I just gave a casual wave. Well.. He told me to come over to him after the pic cos he wanted my number.. So thats how we knew each other. Eh,bloody hell. Why am i talking abt Khairul? Lol. Anyway.. the story between my and Khairul shall continue some other time. Hehehe..      So back to my art I guess. Better start on my color schemes. Or I'll die.I'd love that actually.No,I was just kidding. Orites.. Till then. C ya rounds.     ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~
