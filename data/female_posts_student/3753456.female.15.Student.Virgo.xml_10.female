(please note that the above mentioned scientist has had a 4 year uni course and 30 yrs experience at the nuclear power plant. he also looked like Einstien which is beside the point but incidently indicates intellgence [what an amazing display of alliteration]). when we came home and told greg about what he had told us greg immediatly launched into an attack on the information passed to us which is wrong in gregs eyes, being the all assuming beacon of knowledge that he is, after his brief 1 and a half years of a basic high school physics. in his revelations about the knowledge he assumes he possesses and tries to imply as superior, he inserts large, scientific words that don't agree with the context but thinks that by using these words, dad and i will be impressed and baffled. BAD MOVE, GREGORY. i then proceeded to prove him wrong, and since he can't handle anybody knowing more than him on any given subject, he tried defending himself but failed with flying colours.  ANOTHER VICTORY TO ME!! I AM VICTORIOUS!!  i will continue to bless you with further confrontations and encounters involving my brother, especially if i am sucessfull.
