Ah well, hopefully you can get past your "Katie Withdrawl" symptoms for a minute, and thereby stop convulsing long enough to read this new installment.  School was usual.  Nothing too exciting, besides the fact that my morning started off with a jolt.  Time is skewed in the morning.  5 hours=5 minutes=5 seconds.  Agreed?  Yes, well I had approximately those 5 seconds to throw on a shirt and jeans and boogie downstairs to slam down my grapefruit halve before dashing out the door.  Fortunately, it was all uphill from there.  My brother being a pretty quick driver (aka: OWENslamonthebreak!!don'tyouseethatcar??!?), we got there on time.  All was well.  After  la escuela , I worked from 6-9.  Today's shift was, like school, pretty uneventful and hum-dum-dee-dum.  I did my usual sweep/mop/wipe routine about the lobby and was able to leave on time.  *Yay*  Then, I came home to a substantial pile of homework, which I just recently completed.  Amazing how finishing a few worksheets can leave you with such a sense of accomplishment.  I'm going to savor it while it lasts.  One last thing:  I was accepted to National Honor Society today!  I am excited.  That'll make a great application appetizer for the colleges.  *smile*
