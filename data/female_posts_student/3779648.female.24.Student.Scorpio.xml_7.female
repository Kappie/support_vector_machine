Kinda like how i didnt end up getting my test done last week for whatever reason..  Anyway, today was a perfect day for the zoo, and a day at the zoo it was:) I havent been to Potters Park in probably about 7 years or so. It has changed a lot since then! I went with my mom, sister in law, and two nefews. My favortie babies in the whole wide world! Hey maybe i can figure out how to put up pics on this thing like Christy did.. Ill try that soon:) I was trying to put the pics from the zoo today on my computer but my mom took the batteries out of the camera so i guess it will have to wait. So yeah we saw a lot of animals and i couldnt believe this .. but not only did i GO IN the petting zoo area.. i freaking pet a goat! Thats a huge step for me, not being very fond of animals. I really wanted to go on a camel ride but my mom said no:( Of course i didnt have any money to pay for it so since she said no i couldnt go! lol. sad huh?  But speaking of having no money.. on an awesome note, my parents came home from their weekend up north and had a shit load of beer bottles and cans in the garage! Plus i had got the ones from my grandmas so im pretty excited to take them back tomorrow. Now, i think after readin that myself i have decided THAT was sad.. lol. Oh well, not much i can do about it right now.  I'm still waiting to hear from my caseworker or whatever about my court date for the medicaid appeal. I hope i hear from them soon though cuz i really need to get my back fixed and get myself a job BAD. I cant believe that its been almost FIVE months that i have been without a job! that is so crazy to me. the only time i have been off work that long in my life was when i was living in Germany!  Oh yes, Germany. I try to not even think about it sometimes because every day it gets harder i think. I miss that place SO SO much and my friends even more. Now days i dont really have many friends that i go out with or even talk to. Pretty much Tania and my sister, and thats about it! I keep myself busy and happy though:) I guess thats all that matters. But, if i could be anywhere right now it would be in germany with my best friends. Well, without the fucked up back! lol. Still i guess i would rather be there right now. Okay, im done thinking about it.  math class status: 84% energy status: low
