I'm very tired, since I didn't sleep well last night due to the usual first day nerves and excitement, though with every passing semester the first day grows less and less exciting.  Still only have two grades, but such is life.  I'm happy with the ones I have, and getting other ones could only disrupt that happiness.  Looking forward to a slightly less burdensome semester, so we shall see...
