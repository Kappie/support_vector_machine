Usually I don't dream alot during the school week nights and stuff but this dream was long, sorta made sense is some ways and not in others, but I do feel it had a message.   My Dream that other night  My mother and I were going to this friends of my moms that lives in Ogden.  I remember first standing outside and then looking to the house on the left next to it.  I looked in and there was the living room with a couch and a TV but the on the screen was just that static grey kinda picture.  I remember going into my moms friends house and she took us to the backyard.  Then I remember seeing one my sisters rabbits and I said "Oh Adora" thened I look at that house on the left and Mrs. J was sitting there.  She looked at me as if she knew I was going to be there and said "How was Friday" and I just said "It was good" and that is all I remember from that seen.  Later on I was at a park that was close to the houses, but well I don't know how I got to the park.  Anyways there were these two swings and I sat on one of them and beside me on the other swing was this older woman.  She wasn't like wrinky and granny old but like she was "older" you know.  This lady seemed familiar and had like sorta yellowish, goldish, blondish, sorta whitish kinda hair - basically it was like a blonde but a mix of different colors but I am pretty sure I have never met her or seen her in my life.  She sat there at started telling me about Mrs. J's past.  She told me that the year before she taught at my school nothing in her life had been going right.  She said that she was at the lowest point in her life and she didn't think things could get better and the only thing that kept her going was her kids in her life but then the lady continued and said that she was going through a really rough time in her life and a really "hard stage" in life.  Then she described to me that we all go through these "hard stages" in life at one point or another.  This dream was like odd cause well I hardly ever dream and I swear that dream felt like hours and hours.  I think it was kinda like a message to me though.  Symbolism I guess.  I think since I am having a tough time right now my dream meant that it is normal.  That sometimes people just feel that way - we all feel that way no matter who we are, where we come from, what we look like.  We all feel pain, we all feel sadness.  That seriously is the most interesting dream I have EVER had.  And like it sorta makes sense but sorta doesn't and well I don't think it is true although it could be - I just think there is like stuff on my conscience and somethin' is trying to get some kinda message to me. ___________________________________________________________________________________________   I went to Megan's party and slept over.  OMG it was SOOOOOOOO fun and I met lots of new people.  I feel a transition happening.  Even since I met megan my friend range has expanded and slowly I am being excepted into the more popular crowd.  I mean I like my friends popularity or not, that was never an issue.  But it is also real nice to like have other friends too.  We watched so many movies, we watched The Ring, the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Labarinth that dumb movie for kids cause David Bowie is in it and we like watched all the parts that he sings in [Oh he is a hottie] and we watched The Little Shop of Horrors and stuff.  Then we played like Cranium which was awesome and funny and great and we ordered pizza and stuff and ate like probably 40000 calories worth of junk too.  And well she lives in Mackenzie and holyman her house is HUGE.  Anyone who lives in Mackenzie does not know how lucky they really are.  And well yeah my mom had to go to faith day today cause she works for the Catholic School District thing or whatev. you wanna call it.  So yeah and then when she got back instead of having lunch the people she works with she left so she could have lunch with me and she took me out to B.P. and we ordered pizza...yum.   Then we went shopping to safeway and she bought me cupcakes so I can pack on another 5 pounds which I will have to loose like next week when all the halloween candy is gone and there is no junk left in the house.  LOL.  Well I am going to watch Survivor now cause I taped it from last night.
