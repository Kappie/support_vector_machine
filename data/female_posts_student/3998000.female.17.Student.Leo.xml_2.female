That could be due to the fact that this is now the third website that I have registered myself in so that I can "share my with the world via this beautiful cable modem". I have unsuccessfully attempted these darn things at deadjournal.com and livejournal.com, kind ofironic that those were the two that I chose but I guess you could say I was going through those teenage years where one never really knows how they feel. One day you hate yourself, the next you think you're the bomb. Anyway both of those wonderful glimpses of my past were put to rest due to some stupidity that I published and got caught for, the 'rents don't really approve of sharing your life with complete strangers.   I get it though, I don't even know if I'm really all that comfortable with some complete stranger guy reading this and trying toimagine me sitting here and describing my life. With my luck it would be some old fat man who's been outside in the sun too many hours of his life, smoked too many cigarettes, and probably hasn't showered in days. Hey, everyone attracts a type right? Ha. Anyway, I think I'm going to keep this wonderful glimpse of my life on the dl for a little while, not really register as anyone so that my friends who have all created their own (and about 10 of them have in the past month or so) won't be able to find me and accuse me of being somewhat hypocritical. I think I have a tendency to do that at times.   So in order to protect my own identity and the identities of those I love and care oh so much about, and so that I don't bore you, the reader, to death, I will follow 2 rules when writing these hopefully enjoyable blogs:   1. I will not refer to anyone in their real name. I don't even know if I'll use the same name for the same person in multiple blogs, its more fun that way.   2. I will not provide you with the boring details of every moment I get supper giddy from being in love with some stupid boy.Basically, no one wants to hear about my love for someone when nothings going to happen and, if it is possible, even fewer people want to know about some beautiful relationship where all I say is "oh I love  insert name of love here ". Gag me, please.   So there are my rules: simple, easy, and logical. And now that I have established this blog withall of the necessities, I will make my way into slumberland having left this one question for all to ponder:   If you could have one thing in the world, anything you want (physically possible or impossible) what would you ask for? If you were to attain it, would you be happy or want something more?           Goodnight.
