And I totally said no. Lol he's not really my type. And I hope hes not reading this right now because that would be weird. Eh, we'll see where that goes. You know what I really, really hate? Algebra. Algebra sucks. God damn exponents. When am I ever going to have to use exponents in my adult life? How about never? Its all a conspiracy to confuse the living hell out of teenagers. I'm telling you its a conspiracy. Anywho, had set strike tonight for Mikado, which sucked almost as bad as exponents. Not quite though. It was very, very boring. We had to take the big pagoda dealy down and all the ribbons and stuff. But Josh was there and he's a sexy beast so it made it all worth it lol. Josh is the best, he's my hero. I gave him the answers to a biology lab and he got all the answers wrong. It was funny because my teacher marked all of mine right and he copied word for word. I laughed. A lot. I think that's it. Oh yeah, I went to the most kick ass party Saturday at Adam Sherman's house. Yay for cast parties. Mike Wronski and Noah BOTH took their shirts off so it made it worth my while, Lol j/k. Who wants to see Mike Wronski with his shirt off anyway?!
