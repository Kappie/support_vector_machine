Is it my fault that i dont like open discussions about whats bothering me? *shrugs* oh well. i miss last summer and everything that happend and everything that should've happend that didn't. It bothers me to flirt with people who i cant stand but do it anyways cause im dumb. I miss the way you used to look at me and push back my hair when it was in my eyes and tell me you love me and kiss me on my forehead and it made me feel like a princess. I really hate how everyone is leaving and i feel like im never going to see anyone of my friends ever again. I miss not wondering what i was goin to do on a weekend because i knew one of my friends was goin to come kidnap me and we'd go do something and i wouldnt have to worry about what i said and if i said something and sounded stupid. I missed when i could get together with everyone in one place and just laugh my ass off at stupid little things like matt and renny and stephen makin fun of me tahj mahal *winks*.  and i just miss my old life where everything made sense.
