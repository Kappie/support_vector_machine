I love it! :D *sigh* Today ended up being pretty dang good! I've just been in a weird kinda happiness lately. Dunno why. Tho the other night I was in tears...but yeah. So today...Got up round 8 and went to Spencer to get some more paint for my room. Came home and painted...I got all done by 2:30. So all of my walls are bright yellow now. Pretty neat. I think it really looks cool with the white boarder alone but tomorrow we get to start with orange and then green. Its gonna be interesting. Hope it turns out good! But yeah...Its soo bright! So Kim came over and helped me for awhile and then we sat around doin random stuff and laughing alot. Then mom and I went on a walk...saw some people who I don't really like. Like the chick who trashed me on the internet. Eh. Anyways then I went to Kims and we sadly watched "Who Wants To Marry My Dad" We had fun pickin the girls apart n stuff. Who was ugly, who was to young....all that stuff...so yeah. So then I got home...found out the computer has a virus. Ugh. But I can't get rid of it till I unplug our internet n stuff. So I can do that between painting n stuff. So then my Dad gave me this CD I was soo happy! :D Love it! Ahh...happiness....for awhile atleast...Not talkin to Ross for a week...might kill me.  I suppose I will live. Maybe. LoL Oh and A  very  Happy Birthday to my wonderful friend Kait. Sweet Sixteen! :D Loved You First! ;)  Tara   Current Music:  Just One by Hoobastank  Current Mood:  Happy  Quote of the Day:  "You must have been a cow in a past life cuz you really seem to like cows." -Kim
