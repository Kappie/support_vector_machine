NOT today as i'm getting ready to go meet some friends for their b-day movie he CALLS ME!!! fortunately i had told my mom the whole story and she helped cover for me by telling him i was in the shower and that i was going out in a little bit...he plans to call back! ugh, i don't know wut to do! i mean wut if he tries to ask me to go out somewhere, or to "hang out" i mean u can't really reject a guy like that...it's just mean, but i don't like him so then i can't go w/him either so...GRRR!! help me out guys, y do i attract these types of people?!?!? changedfish
