But I think the reality of going to Michigan on Tuesday and walking in to my grandparents house without Pap there, is starting to scare me a bit because I'm not ready.  I'm not ready to see his empty chair, I'm not ready to see his chair at the table being used by someone else, and I'm so not ready to sit on the front porch where he use to spend his summer days counting cars and watching the church across the street.  I wish he could be here!  I wish he could be here to see how well I'm doing with my surgery and see how I'm changing into a better person - A person I know he'd be so proud of.  I wish I could of spent more time with him instead of wasting the time I did have with him.   However, I know he's up in heaven!  He knows we all love him and miss him especially during the holidays - His favorite times of the year.
