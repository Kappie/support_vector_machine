Don't forget to check the  origin of the questions  and blog your responses asap. Isn't it fun? I've only done two, so far. This last one and the one before it, and I'm totally hooked!    Daf, I'm glad you found SSN useful. I'll try to link some of the more interesting sites that I visit. If you guys find places of interest, do the same also.
