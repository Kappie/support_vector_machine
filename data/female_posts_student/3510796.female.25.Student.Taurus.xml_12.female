We all attended a birthday party for my cousins son this afternoon. Spongebob.  I hate Spongebob, about as much as the Rapers.  There was Spongebob crap everywhere.  The only reason I hate Spongebob is because he teaches little kids to talk and act like white trash.  Anyway, I choose not to let my children watch cartoons like that.  Done with that rant.  I guess Mo wants Spiderman, and the only reason I think that is everything is Spiderman.  Right now he  would be  Spiderman if he could.  Not to mention Spiderman is in love with MJ, the cute red head.  I suppose Mo already likes red heads, he tells me all the time how beautiful I am.  Awwwww.  And of course my favorite store, coughtargetcough, is not carrying ANY Spiderman decorations.  Time to be creative and make my own.  Dont worry, I am a creative person, so this can be done!!   Princess Sophia, hard to believe, eh?  She already conned my Mom into buying her a  Happy Birthday Barbie.   Even though that isn't a princess, she acted like one and scored a present.  The house will be filled with red, white, and blue balloons for Mo, and Pink, White and Purple balloons for Sis.  Spiderman and Princess, together at last?!?  We'll have to make it a red head princess. ;-)  I crack myself up.  Onto another topic, its that time of year where I am itching to get tatted or pierced.  For those of you who do not have a tattoo or a piercing, don't begin to understand the addiction.  Its been too long since my last piercing, and even longer since my last tat.  I have been searching this site and looking at pics of  urlLink all kinds of piercings , and I mean ALL KINDS!! I'm thinking eyebrow or ...., who knows.  :-Maybe that means I shouldn't get it done, if I cant think of any place.  I keep waiting to see it in a dream.  As far as the tat, I know what I want, but I don't know where.  On the flip side, I also know where I want something, but I don't know what.  Can you tell I am a real decisive person?   I got this kick-arse charm today-in the mail-from this really kick arse guy named Sod.  Its so badass, I cant even look at it without smiling.  Three guesses as to what it is.  OK, it says Dave Matthews Band in Reddish Orange letters and the background is Blue.  Hell, here is a pic of it,  urlLink Best Damn Charm.  Go there, be happy.  :-)  And now for my Bonnaroo update section of the post.  Dave and Friends played last night in Memphis, out in the corn fields.  I texted this guy to wish him a Happy Birthday and he was like, "Guess who I am watching right this second."  Way to rub it in!  Here is the set list-    Friday  June 11 2004  Bonnaroo Festival  Dodo  Trouble  Up And Away  Solsbury Hill  Stay Or Leave  Save Me  Oh  Up On Cripple Creek  Some Devil * Dancing Nancies + Thing ~ Tell Me Something Good  Gravedigger  Grey Blue Eyes  So Damn Lucky  Too High  Fire  Hey Bulldog  ---------------  Encore   Waste Ä Everyday Ä  @ Bathtub Gin Ä  @ Drum and Bass Jam  @ Thank you    Special Guests: * Dave Solo + Dave And Tim ~ Dave, Tim and Brady Ä Dave And Trey  @ indicates a segue into next song   Grey is a little more than jealous over Dave and Trey performing  Waste .  I love that song!  The Dead is playing tonight and I think Moe. is playing tonight.  Getting angry, so Im done talking about Bonnaroo.  Superfly started shooting pool this morning in the City Cup.  I just talked to her and they are in their third match.  If they win this match and the next, they will go to Las Vegas.  Haven't heard anything yet, but I'm sure I'll blog it tomorrow or the next day.  Go Superfly!   PEACE.LOVE.DMB.    |6 Days!|
