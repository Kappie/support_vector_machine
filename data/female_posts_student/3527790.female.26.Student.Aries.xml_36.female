Not that the things I have been facing have been that horrible or anything new. But it seems that everytime I try my hand at something I think will end in a postive effect it turns negative!   Hopefully today things will start truning around for me. Maybe not the events in my life but in my attitude! So that even when people or things happen that are negative I can not take it personally and smile anyways.   Who knows...But I can hope!
