BELLEFONTAINE--On many occasions I have heard this one said "Belluhfontayne" as if the person was trying to say each letter. However, people living there assure me it's BELLFOUNTAIN, like the word "bell" and the word "fountain" pronounced as one. BUCYRUS--I was downtown once and I was asked how to get to Buckeyruss. Buckeyruss? I thought for a minute and realized they meant Bew-SIGH-russ, the small town in north central Ohio. CHILLICOTHE--Ever heard of Chilcote? Someone told me they had been there once. Except it's pronounced CHILL-uh-COTH-ee. COLUMBUS--This one's easy enough, Co-LUM-bus. But if you want to sound like a real Columbusite, you have to say KLUMbus, as in "Gee, ain't it great here in KLUMbus?" GAHANNA--No, it's not the African nation of Ghana, it's Guh-HAN-uh. INDIANOLA--Someone once told me they lived on Indyola St. near campus. "Indyola" sounds like it belongs in Indianapolis. Try INDIAN-ola, which I understand is named for some long-gone Indian mounds. JAEGER STREET--"JAY-grrr" would seem to be the correct pronunciation for this German Village street. But it's actually YAY-grrr. Hey, it was settled by Germans, so what do you expect? KINNIKINNICK--Someone once asked me if I had ever attended the Tecumseh! outdoor drama near Chillicothe, located by a small town called Nick-nick. Nick-nick? Wasn't that what Latka Gravas called making love on the old Taxi show? It's pronounced KINNY-kinn-ick, just like it's spelled. KIOUSVILLE--When I first moved here I thought this small Madison county town was "Cuesville", like a place where pool cues live. But locals insist it's KYES-ville, rhyming with "eyes". LANCASTER--You may be saying, "Gee, that's LAN-CASS-ter", that's an easy one. In most places you'd be right, but for unknown reasons it's LANK-uh-ster here. MARCONI BLVD.--I was once asked directions to Macaroni Boulevard. Huh? Oh, you mean Mar-KOH-nee, you know, like the guy who invented radio. NEWARK--Yup, it's pronounced NEW-erk just like the one in New Jersey. But if you want to sound like you're from there, say NERK. OLENTANGY--A lot of visitors say the river and the street as OHL-en-TANG-ee, like the river tastes tangy. In fact it's OHL-en-TANJ-ee, rhyming with the word "tangible". PATASKALA--Nope, it's not "PATT-uh-SKALL-uh", it's Puh-TASS-kuh-luh. PHILLIPI ROAD--An old girlfriend of mine was in town and she referred to Phil-IP-pee Road. It was all I could do to keep from cracking up laughing; it is pronounced PHIL-ih-PIE. RIFFE BUILDING--The Vernal Riffe Building, named for a former long-time state senator, isn't pronounced "Riff"; it's RYFFE (a long "i" in the middle). SCIOTO--The same former girlfriend referred to the SKEE-oto River. Both the river and the street are pronounced SIGH-oh-toe, another Indian name. SENSENBRENNER--I recently heard someone refer to Senseybrunner Park downtown. Senseybrunner? Just sound it out: SEN-sen-BREN-ner. It's a former mayor. SULLIVANT--At first glance it may look Lucas Sullivan or Sullivan Avenue, but it's SullivanT, Sullivan with a T, named after Lucas Sullivant, founder of Franklinton that is now the near west side of Columbus.
