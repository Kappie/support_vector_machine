I then found out that my best friend was gonna go out w/ him. So naturally, I got mad @ her. BIG mistake. I found out from another girl online who lives by this guy, that she has been w/ this guy for 6 months, which is longer than he had even been talking 2 me, let alone my bff. So I tell her, even though I'm mad at her 4 another reason. So now we're both mad as heck at this guy, b/c:   1) He ditched me for my best friend. 2) He cheated on us BOTH w/ the same chick who he's been w/ half a year.  Even though I don't like him, I never TOLD him that. So as far as he knows, I'm still at home absolutely "smitten" and waiting for his call. Oh I'm looking forward to his call alright, but I guarantee you, he won't find it pleasant AT ALL.  ~ME~
