Well Snickers, my appropriately named dog, got a bag of Hershey's Kisses. He then took it to his lair: under the desk. He has everything down there. That dog lives like a king. He had an empty bread bag, old tub of butter, a box of Girl Scout Cookies, and the list goes on and on. My mom saw that he got the bag of kisses, and immediately was trying to get it away from him. But not because chocolate can kill dogs, oh no, it was because "he'll be shitting that out for weeks!" So the dog is growling and not making it easy to get the bag of candy. We both cornered him but he wasn't giving. Then he ran into the kitchen and under a smaller table. This is where it got ugly. He was being so bad, that we got out... THE BROOM. We think the dog was beaten early in his life with a broom (we didn't get him until later on), so whenever he is REALLY bad we use that to piss him off. But he usually pees out of fear. I know that right now you are thinking we are terrible pet owners, but then you must not have met my dog. Anyways, my mom was poking at the dog trying to loosen his grip on the bag. Little kisses were flying out EVERYWHERE! Then my mom was sweeping them towards her away from the dog. I was laughing so hard, and still am. THe dog was FREAKING out and there was candy everywhere and it was complete chaos---TUMULT! Then I grabbed the broom and was sticking the stick end in his mouth in attempts to dislodge the bag. He started to run back towards his lair, and I freaked out and jumped out of the way. But then I was chasing him with the broom (sweeping part towards me) and trying to use the stick part to make the dog move towards the wall where I could grab it. It was sooo crazy. The dog took a detour and hid under the coffee table where my mom grabbed the bag of candy and made me put it away, it was really slobbery. I laughed so hard, I wish it was on video.
