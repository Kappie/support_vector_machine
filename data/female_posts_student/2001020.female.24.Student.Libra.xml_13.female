Don't want to eat lunch, don't want to work, don't want to be here. I went with my friend to The Whisky last night to see her friends' band play. They rock, check 'em out for yourself: www.minuslarry.com. I really dig them. There's a guy in the band that I completely dig, too. I don't know him at all, but he resembles my ex boyfriend so much, in many ways and mannerisms. I probably won't go after him or anything, because that's probably not very healthy. I cannot just try and find a replacement for R in every guy I meet. I just have to get over R. What a boring day. Nothing much to say. I actually want to just go out and get plastered tonight, and the next night, and the next night. I'm not depressed, I know how being depressed feels, and I feel better than that. I'm just bored, I guess. Well, whatever.
