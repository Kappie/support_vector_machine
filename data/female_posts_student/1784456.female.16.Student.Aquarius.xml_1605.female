YES!!!!  wot did i miss at school today?! Has mr linnitt taken down that stupid dragonfly yet and does he want our coursework in now cos i think i may have lost all the graphs!!! o well, how was biology katie? lynne, how was media? and of course i can't ask claire how was maths and english but i'll say it anyway!!! i did a quick iq test thing the other day and i think my iq was something around 145/150 but i can't remember. was quite amazing actually. c ya 2 moz xoxox
