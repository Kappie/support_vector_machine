It's eight pages in font size 11 at the moment and I haven't even finished it! Eeeek! I need to know how long every one elses are because I think mine's gonna be too long. Oh, yeah and the title... hmm... The Lost White Tulip? The Threads of White Tulips? Hmm... yeah, if you haven't guessed it's got some thing to do with white tulips, so it would be good to have them in the title. Oooh, Chao, the guy in Manu Chao is French! Wow! Cool guy, he travels the globe writing his songs! I want his job!!! Mind you... could be hard to drag a piano around the desert and places... Yeah...  urlLink http://www.whspliff.net/  I guess they're proud to sell canabis! It was advertised in the Glastonbury magazine *see, I can't spell it now cause of french classes!* I wasn't searching for it! Honest!
