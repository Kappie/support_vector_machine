Granted all the tests got cancelled because of the snow (except for Riley, but you don't have him of course, and he's  gay ). 50 point essay in Kelly among other things; it's about e.e. cummings, so all you really have to say is, "The guy's fucking cracked," and that should about do it. I can't believe she almost sent you to school and bitched about the whole speed thing. Well, yeah actually, I can believe it ("baseboard dust", remember?), but I think it's horseshit. And it's your car so bygod, if you want to bust the living shit out of it, they should say "Go right ahead dear," or "How heavy do you want the sledge to be?"   Did you get a "thx!!!11" for picking her up? You could have just...not, I'd have loved to see that. And I'm sorry about Christy. I think your mom just gave the orders out of desperation so man, I hope you didn't follow through. But it's alright, because there's a good weekend or so to recover, and me and Will are planning on having mental health weeks come next, and man, we'd be happy if you joined us.   Eh, I hope you have a good weekend man, to make up for the shoddy-suck day.
