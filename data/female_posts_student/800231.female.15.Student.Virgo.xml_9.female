It was pretty random even for her, I was just sitting there eating my blueberry muffin when she came out with this. "When I was 6 my cousin made a celery penis..." "What?" "He made it out of tape, glue and celery... Then he ate it." At this point, everyone in our group was staring at her. "He got really sick though. His mum took him to the doctor. The doctor was like 'what did you eat?' and my cousin was like 'I ate a celery penis!' and the doctor was like 'A what?!' and he was all 'I made it with tape and glue...' that's why he's in counseling..." Jeeze, I nearly choked to death on my muffin, she said it with a completely straight face too.  Kinda had to be there.
