I've been doing some really, REALLY interesting character work lately, going back to writing short fiction and revisiting some of my old work.  Important thing is to keep writing, no matter  WHAT the genre....writers write period. I know that for myself I can't consistently write in ONE genre for very long before it burns me out...... I need space to stretch my legs If you're interested I'm going to start posting them on my other blog....  urlLink Getting Glassy   2.  In Other News  June  is full of fun and interesting ways to distract myself from well......myself First off!  urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick  comes out this Friday June 11th! unfortunately I'll working on Friday......  Then There's the  urlLink Nip/Tuck   Season Premiere June 22nd Last season's finale was RIDICULOUS!
