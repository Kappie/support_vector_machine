She seems to have lost all hope of ever walking again, despite countless words of encouragement.  I really do believe that your physical health can depend upon your mental attitude and state; persistant pessimism is certainly not going to get one out of bed and on one's feet.  In any case, Opa is still searching for a house in East Bernard.  I am praying that we can find one, as moving down to be closer with family would be most beneficial for my grandparents at this point.  At this juncture I'm in limbo and am not certain of how to proceed or help out.  As it stands now, I'm planning on returning to Starbucks in order to raise money for the 9-day mission trip to Cuba in July, but I can't very well work full time and be with Mimi in the hospital as much as I have been.  Plus, I myself am leaving the state in August to start Grad School, and I have no clue how my presence will fit in with regard to helping Mimi and Opa move out of the city as well.  Things are so up in the air right now, more than usual, that I rather feel like banging my head against the wall.  Despite the fact that I know my decision to go to Tulane was the right one for me, at some point in the not-too-distant future I know that I'm going to feel awkward as I simply pick up everything and leave--with Mimi still in physical therapy, and with Opa quite possibly having to sell our house and move into another one.    I know that all of my family wants me to be happy and live my own life, but at the same time I can't help but feel a bit strange and self-centered dropping everything and starting a new life.  On the other hand, I know that my grandparents moving to East Bernard to be near the rest of the family would keep Mimi's mind off of the fact that I'm officially moving out and living in another state.  While I've travled all over the world and even lived in an apartment, this next phase of my life will be very different; I won't be coming back to Austin to live, not for a very long time.  The next two years will be in New Orleans, and then after that--who knows?  Ideally I'd like to get my Ph.D. in the Northeast, either in Boston, New York, or D.C.  Oh yeah--I guess I should mention, for those of you whom I haven't mentioned this to--I'll be doing a Master's program in Latin American Studies at Tulane University in New Orleans, staring in late August.  The decision between UT and Tulane was gut-wrenching, but ultimately it came down to the fact that: a) Tulane specializes in Cuba and Caribbean studies; b) I love the city and the campus; and c) Through some divine gift I've been given, Tulane wants to pretty much fund my graduate career.  This way, I can continue research on both Cuba and Brazil in a plausible fashion; if I stayed at UT, I really wouldn't be able to finish a thesis on the Cuban economy and would have to stick with Brazil.  So, this chapter of my life is almost over.  It is about time to open a new one, I suppose.
