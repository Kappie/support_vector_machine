So anyway today we hung out by dans.. me and alfonso did.. and alfonso road kasti's bike to dans and left it out side which is like an inch from the door, and it got stolen. so we rode around practically all day and searched. Well i also found out fredi was talking more lies and shit from the past so that pissed me off. BUT hes a waste of my life. so after that me, dan, kasti, alfonso, rudy, and alexis chilled at the park. Then after that me and dan went to go get los burritos and alfonso and alexis went to buy sum cheap shit at dolar junction. we met up after that. wait maybe the park thing and the los burritos thing is the other way around.. maybe we ate first.. yeah we did. ok ne way. after all that i started painting my window.. then christina and naomi came by and i talked to them.. then christina left and naomi wanted to chill so i did.. till .. like.. 11. Then from there...... tooooo.. painting my window .. then alfonso came back over .. and then.... thats now. so there is my day. Im done..  Peace
