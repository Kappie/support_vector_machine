My dad thinks all i do in here is complain about my life and how horrible my parents are to me and how much life sucks...typical. but i dont do that. b.c. i love my parents and i dont have a horrible life...Other people talk about the interesting things they did...COUGHGOINGTOENGLANDCOUGH...and stuff that made a difference to them...but me... idk. i'm very dispassionate lately. i was takling to jessica yesterday when she was over.Npthing excits me. nothing really ever gets me hooked...today the only thing that got my attention was the cute kid we see everyday in that same spot... but ya know what, i refuse. REFUSE to do it. i refuse. so i wont. i wont do that over and over and over again. if you want my help getting with him. fine, but i'm not into that right now. i Hate it.  i'm pissed b.c. i'll probably fail my english test... did a short answer completely wrong damn word "minor". adn mrs helmcamp being the hormonal baby-carrier she is will be "NOOOOOO!! NO!!!!! X!!!! WRONG!!!" and there goes my A in that class...sigh. and i was counting on that class' A... I saw kevin working today... i miss him. last year was the best. during marching season. He was awsome. but i haven't talked to him since ANDREA is holding him prisoner now. so he doesn't even talk to me now. damn her. i know were she lives. Who's with me? My brother is coming tonight. haven't seen him since christmas... he asked me to write up some stuff for him. haven't gotten around to it...idk. i'm not giddy about it anymore or anything. that wore off really quickly when he settled into his idealistic 'why dont you better yourself, why dont you be like me' hints to me. i've been trying to be like him since i was born. but i had to change that, didn't i. and the fact that i haven't see him but 3 times a year for the past 4 years... eh, its just a dulled sense in the back of my head now. i had a dream that him and my mom died in a plane crash. They're leaving monday to go to Richmond. well, i doubt i have rasputinic powers. at least i hope i dont. so what do you write in your 'blog'?
