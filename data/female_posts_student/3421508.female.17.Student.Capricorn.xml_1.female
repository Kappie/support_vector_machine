I feel bad that even though you're just a phone call away, I somehow find myself so caught up in my own world that's finally beginning to fall in place.   Remember all the stupid things I did back then? From getting ridiculously drunk to suicidal and even to question my own faith? I'll tell you now, I made it this far because of all the love that my friends and most imporatantly, my family gave me. The concern that you guys have for me is unbelievable. You're only a little over one and a half years younger than me and already I see the beautiful person that you are and the hints of the better person to come. Even then, you've always had a strong head on your shoulders that was strong enough to shoulder even some of my pain and my troubles which were nothing compared to what you face. And yet, not once did you tell me off or bursh me off.  The best thing I can do is to tell you the same thing you told me. To hang on and to just believe. Lately, I have and it's helped me so much. I am a much happier person now. I'm still not the sort of catholic who prays every single day or even pays attention during mass all the time. But I am grateful and I'm trying.   And you have shown me all that I have. You've always told me not to give up. And now I put it to you. Don't lose hope ok? It's ok if you want to talk or don't want to talk about it. Just know that I do care.  Luff MeL   -- Posted by Psychotic Rock Star to MenTalLy UnPluGGed at 6/7/2004 11:27:28 PM
