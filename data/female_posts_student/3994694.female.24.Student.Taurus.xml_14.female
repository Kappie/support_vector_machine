And it's not like I was even totally immersed in Chinese culture -- I moved around a bit and the only place I really spent any length of time in was a Tibetan area.   But I don't think the reverse culture shock was my reaction to NZ culture after time in Chinese culture. I think it was my reaction of a new self to my old life and my old self. What I mean is, China changed me somehow, and then when I returned home I couldn't just slip back into my old life comfortably.   One thing I notice about my life here is that it's so individual. I am the centre of my life, and everything revolves around me at varying distances. Except I'm not a sun, giving life, but a black hole -- sucking life. I am a student, doing my work. I have different groups of friends -- some development friends, some church friends, some Chinese friends, some random friends. They don't all know each other. I relate to each little satellite in my own way, but they do not collide.   In the village, you are not the centre of your life. I have yet to figure out what is -- possibly the family, or the community? But anyway, all your friends and relatives know each other -- you are a group and a community. It's really annoying and it's wonderful. So did I change? I don't think I stopped seeing myself as the centre of my life. But I got used to not having to make decisions on my own, I got used to my decisions in part being influenced by other's desires. The simplest decision in New Zealand just seems impossible. I really stopped caring what I ate or where I slept, and I just can't be bothered making those kind of decisions now. The nice thing about traditionalised cultures is that there is a set way to do everything. This is when you wash. This is what you eat for breakfast. This is what time you sleep. This is what time you snack. This is what clothes you wear.   It leaves time for the important things. Do you know in NZ I can sometimes spend 20 minutes deciding what to wear? And nobody cares anyway! I can spend half a day thinking about what to cook for dinner, every option which will give me nutrition, it just depends on what kind of taste I want. So many choices that are meaningless. It tires me out. I wonder if this kind of community environment is possible here? In the city, I don't even know the person who lives in the other half of our house.
