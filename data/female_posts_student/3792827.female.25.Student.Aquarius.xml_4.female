I have learned that in more instances than not, they are deceiving me. I don't understand why people do this. I'm not perfect and I don't expect anyone else to be, but have enough respect for someone to just keep your mouth shut if you don't mean what you say. During all of the crap I've been through lately, I have found that in all honesty, I may have 2 friends. The others... friends? HA!! I douby they even know what a friend is... or what it means to be someone's friend. A friend isn't someone that will walk out on you the first chance they get over something that isn't even anything in the first place. If anyone knows a REAL friend out there, let me know cause I sure could use one.  I'm out! But I'll be back. I've got enough drama to keep ANYONE satisfied (if it's DRAMA that you like).
