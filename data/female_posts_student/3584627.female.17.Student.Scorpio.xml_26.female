GEEz.   extract: "cj and pris was really really angry at the state of the booth.... and pris kind of scolded me yesterday.... well, they have a right to be angry.... it was not well done at all.... if anyone was to be blame, it was me and vinder..... i hope you would not blame the others... cause they seriously were not aware of anything.... vinder and i were the main ones who was actually "planning" the stuff.... really sorry you guys.... i'm so so sorry..... i'm disappointed in myself and the way things have turned out.... please don blame the others..... i'm really really sorry...." blame others? who? my hunny(Zin) and I? wadever. blame it on us. blame as much as u want to. Riz already tried his best, so pls shut up abt it!
