I had a really weird dream last night. There was a 74-storey building and I was in a race to see who could run up every flight, circle the floor and go up one more, etc. I think when I woke up I was still stuck on the 30s. Every single time the alarm clock went off, I shut it up and went back to dreaming about climbing stairs.
