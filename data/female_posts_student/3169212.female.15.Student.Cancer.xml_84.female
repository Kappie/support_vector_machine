I'm sure there are a few demons that would gladly devour your souls and your bodies.  Only problem with that is that Toguro might be the leader which would be bad for everyone.  That guy would kill a demon for just looking at him.  Maybe we should just join forces after all.  I could use some allies, I just found out that one of the despised demon gods disguised himself as me and tried to kill Kurama.  (Fool)
