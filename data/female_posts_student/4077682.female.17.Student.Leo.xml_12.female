And then there are the other people who I also love soo much, but it seems like they kinda drift in and out of my life. It's hard to describe the people I care about because they are all so complicated, and the way I feel about them changes from day to day, but this is it sorta...        The lovely ladies I hang out with, are really not usually ladies at all.           One of them is Zoe. She doesn't give a flying fuck about what anyone thinks, and is anything but your classic girl. She could out burb anyone without trying, but she's also one of the most fun and beautiful person I've ever met. I've known her for a long time.           Another one of my girls is Sam. She is sooo wonderful, that I would DIE without her. We have so much in common. She can make anyone feel better, and is SUCH a girl. She's the Racheal Green of our group. Sometimes she brings herself down.. but there's no reason for it... she's gorgeous. I met her in gr 6. I met another one of the girls (Jennifluffer) through her.           Jenn is sooooo funny. Shes kinda more of a combination of the first 2. She's similar to me: she sometimes likes to annoy people, she LOVES to sing :D:D and can go from loud to quiet in a second. This girl is an amazing lister, and is sooo much fun. She has awsome eyes and is also so beautiful. I met her 2 years ago.          Another one I just met this year. Kelcey is sooo shy and quiet, and deffinitly knows how to be a girl. She's soo sensitive and would put anyone before herself. She couldn't make a disision if her life depended on it, but we love her for it. She could NEVER piss you off, and it always seems like everything happens to her.         Theses are the 4 girls I hang out with the most.     But I gtg.. I will write about the guys later.... till next time.
