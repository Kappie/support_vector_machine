But they are talking about HIM, saying how he died and so forth. I just started watching it about 2 minutes ago and its talking about the cloth that covered him. Seein how there is an inprint on it of him and his blood. And i thought it was kind of funny how everyone is saying whats the big deal of this dued, he means nothing. Yet the world is excited about him, wanting to know more. Kind of weird. If this worlds finds out that this is the son of God and the son of man...What will they do?    As for myself i have been alittle down today. Other then my high for driving. i have been faced with the fact that i am not a good person to talk to...I was talking to Jerred and i had nothing to talk about... Matt... the same thing. Katie, and Shannon. And o man... i didn't know what to say. I hate it... I'm just not good at relationships...
