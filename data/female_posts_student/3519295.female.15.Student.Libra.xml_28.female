One looked like Kelby Wood just not so mean and vengeful looking, and mucho mucho taller. The other one was v. tall, with curly/wavy blonde/brown hair and v. nice eyes. I think his name was...Nate.  So.  I am thinking of getting a perm just because I am so freaking tired of my hair and my big nose that I want to cut both of them right of my head. At least if I got a perm, my nose wouldn't be the first thing you gasped and shrieked at when you saw me. lol. no, just kidding. i think I am v. pretty, just maybe a littly freckly. But it's summer so it's the worst time for freckly people. It's freckle season. I just wish it was the same as hunting season and that freckles could be whacked...pardon my soprano.   I am sad that I haven't lost any sizes yet. I would love to be a size four or five next week, but you know that will take at least two weeks...For those of you who don't know me I am being completely sarcastic. I am commited to running everyday at least once and eating less calories than I burn and maintaining my diet at least until I drop 2 or 3 sizes, which my mom says will have happened by two weeks into the school year. I can dig it.  Megan, I have decided that I do not want to be in your project for the Ruff Draft because of what I read on your websites. While Thrift Stores are the coolest places ever, it's the same kind of cool as socks with designs on them; the kind of cool that you do not want every student in Edmond reading about. Especially Eric Sample, who Melanie called and he is most definetly going to Santa Fe. I think we freaked him out a little, but he said that yes, he does know a chick who is a year older than him named Katie. He said "oh, yeah, she's really hot. Does she go to Santa Fe?" Most definite NO, little man, but feel free to call me anyway. I'm dreading Back To School Shopping, seeing as how I am going to have to buy jeans that will not fit me in a few weeks. sigh. life is so unfair. oh, well. at least i'll be skinny.
