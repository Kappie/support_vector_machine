I have a picture of my Nana in my cubicle at work. I find that I avoid looking at it sometimes; I guess it makes me sad to see her. She is so beautiful and God got him a wonderful angel when we lost her.    Here is a picture of my Nana (Grandma) and Nanu (Grandpa) and all of their children (my Aunts and Uncles). My Mom is the pretty lady on the left in the white with pink flower sweater. My Nana is the bright smiling lady, in the light blue dress, in the middle)  I miss my Nana a lot and I know she is felling better now but it just wasn’t her time yet.     My throat still hurts a lot and I am still coughing. I wish this would all just go away. I haven’t talked to Jesse in a few days but my new philosophy is no news is good news. I would still like to talk to him but I am sure he is very tired and very busy. I know that the days are warming up in Kuwait and with all of those layers from the uniforms on they must be hot and uncomfortable. I miss my soldier. I wish I could see him for 5 minutes, just so I knew he was ok. I haven’t heard much from his mom, but I wonder if she even realizes that her son is in Kuwait and not in America any more. I hate calling her to talk, she makes me so uncomfortable sometimes. Jesse knows I hate talking to her, heck I think he dislikes talking to her too. It is sad, I sort of wish they had a better relationship, I wish she would show some sign of caring for her son. I guess that is how some people deal with things.  Any way, I am crossing my fingers in hope that I get a call from my Loverly Hubby Bear (I am sure he will smack me for that one).   TTYL!
