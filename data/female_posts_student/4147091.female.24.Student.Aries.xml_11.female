I like to think of myself as smarter than the average bear when it comes to computers, however, appearently the average bear must be illerate and cannot find the on button on a computer.  I follow all directions, generate a code, copy and paste said code and with some minor tweeking (which as far as i was concerned I shouldn't have had to do) I get my blog to say 'Blogroll me!'.  yippie.  nope.  When you press said link, nothing happens.  So after tweeking it more, deleating some "'s adding some "'s, I finally gave up and decieded I"m going to marry the next man who can read html. Any takers?  So that is why the link section on my sidebar is empty.  I want it to say Blogroll me!, but I can't so I refuse to add any other links there, which I"m sure would be much easier than the aforementioned Blogroll me!
