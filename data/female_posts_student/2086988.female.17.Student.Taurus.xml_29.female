Well, lol I'm making my 8 year old niece vacuum, I knew babysitting these kids would have some sort of perks. And tonight I gotta go finish my christmas shopping for meine Mutter, December 24th is her Bday!!! Wahooness! Man I seriously need to finish cleaning my room, I can kinda walk through it, ohh gotta change my sheets, I sware the bed gets changed more times than I sleep in it. I can't wait till next Tuesday!! ;) I'm so freaking excitied!!! Well it sounds like Kayla is tearing down the house downstairs, I better go see what's going on before the house falls in or something.    Don't speak I know just what you're saying So please stop explaining Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
