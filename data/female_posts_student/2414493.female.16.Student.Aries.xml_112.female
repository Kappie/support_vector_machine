I just feel slightly retarded.  I have JESU, JOY OF MAN'S DESIRING stuck in my head. I remember the time we played it for the Arts Council meeting and we just stopped for the all-choral parts. A red-faced Mr. Benson turns around and says, "To hear the rest of this, come to our concert!" I love the song, though. I think there's a piano verson that's beautiful, too, but I'm probably too lazy to a. find it and b. learn it.
