I only 'knew' a few people, but I 'knew by sight' everyone else. Me and Izzy ended up with a bottle of red wine between us, and someone thought I was 19! *muhahahaaa evil plans forming* It's very dangerous to tell a fifteen year old kid that you think they look eighteen! *dam, must be my new hair style! aaargh everyone thinks it's permed!* Whenever I get my hair cut I always look older! *so if i get it shaved, i'll look 50 and get away with absolutly anything* Yeay! Fun!
