I go in tomorrow and pick up my wrist band at about 6:30am and go sit in a room which will more than likely be almost empty and shake and hold in tears until they take me back. I will then go back and change into a glamous hosptial gown, take a few pills with some water, and recieve a shot in my ass. I hate needles, i think ive made that VERY clear on my blog, but im not worried about that needle. Im worried about the next one...the IV. haha They're going to stick a little needle and numb my hand, but still...eeek. Anyways, after the IV is in i'll be calm, high, and happy. My next issue is going home. ughhhhh pain and drugs and having to climb stairs and move around.  My friends will all be home today and i hope when they get in one at least calls me. :p i wanna hear all about their trip!!! I wish they all would have been home this week...:(  Liz and i hung out yesterday. we went to the mall and walked around for a little over 3hrs and we got some binders for school and today we are going to fix them up. we put bands and stuff on the front and make em look kickass. :D  My uncle came over and was working on my grandparents computer and obviously took yahoo messanger off...well...im putting it back on. damn u uncle dwight. damn you to hell. lol I'll just hide it so umm..u cant see it? lol  Lets see....yeah....and life goes on. I'm looking forward to seeing people at school, but not working...omg the last thing i wanna think about is having to catch up, i hope i dont miss too much school. oh, well i kinda do, so i can hang with lauren. :p lol  And messanger is up and running...thank u jesus (total time: uno minute)  Now i gotta go print up pictures of bands and stuff to plaster my binder with!! fun stuff.  oooh and liz and i saw this HOT guy at the mall...and we sprayed guys smell good stuff on us, i was wearing polo. ooo i rock  LAUREN IS ON!!
