In attendance:  Drew, Brad, Katy, Taher, Jordan, Dan, Rick, Stephy  and  I . Full house. Awesome. :D We joked around, ordered food, Katy got some kick ass voicemail greetings ( urlLink  Drew voicemail    urlLink Dan's vulgar one  ), she should record them and post them for all to hear. Dan's vulgar one is hilarious! :D Chocolatey-goodness was ordered, and then attacked by Drew and Katy. They put up a good fight...but sadly were unable to conquer. Piggy-back rides ensued. Drew was the only one willing to be taken on by me (hense the subject line quote). I won't break people. :p Afterwards, Drew openned up his car's trunk and blasted some tunes. Everyone attempted to break dance it down charmer style (Pic's posted below). Then it was onward to the Mountainlair plaza! We took over U92 on Doug's shift, and while the rest of the charmers engaged in top secret missions, I hopped over to the 'Corner Cafe' after being invited by Robin earlier that day. I got there around 1 am. Chilled with Robin *she made me two iced espressos and I was wired!*, Klara and Pam. Everyone else had left. :( But I had fun chillin with my sisters. :D Afterwards, I got a ride from Jordan and I was introduced to Damien. They were headed to Trudy's party. So, I got home around 2:30 in the morning. I was still wired from the freakin espresso damnit! So I watched some of Season Six of Sex and the City, until my cell rang at a little after 4. Drew was planning on heading back to Pittsburgh dead tired with a headache. That just wouldn't do, so I hopped online and got him a complimentary night on the futon of Brad's at his House of Asskickery. I felt much better, I would've been worried if he would've gone back to PA. Thank you Brad! :D   Next day, went and ran some errands. Bought two size 5 mini skirts for 10$ each at Elder Beerman on sale. Sweet! :D Came home, did some things, got ready for the Fake Eddie concert at Liquid Lounge @ 9:30. Called Robin to let her know about the concert and if she was downtown and interested, told her to stop by. :D Finally got a chance to hop online about 5 minutes till Rick was supposed to be at our door. Got IMed from Eddie who I hadn't heard from in forever and a day, sorry I had to run, you caught me at a really bad time! In attendance:  Neil, Ricky, Morgan, Katy  and  I . So we were chillin, waiting for everyone else to show up. 10:30 rolls around and we decide to walk up to the Den so Morgan can get some smokes. On our way up we run into Taher, who wasn't paying any attention in his car. He left us in the dust for another party. :P Up to the Den and back again. We are later joined by Brad. I see Klara and Robin inside and talk to them for a bit, then they wanted me to head to Elements with them. Sorry, I was already with the charmer's. So I made plans to chill with them in the future. We are then joined by Dan and Jordan. And later Nicole and Matt her fiance. :D We stayed for 4 Fake Eddie songs, Liquid Lounge was crowed and hot. Everyone was hungry, so we headed to Eat N Park for some food. Many jokes and laughs later at EnP, Katy treated everyone (thanks Katy! :D), we head back to Dan's to party and chill. So much fun. Seriously. Many pictures were taken, they were fucking hot, some hilarious, most fucking awesome! I stayed at Dan's until 7 this morning, then went back to Brad's for about an hour, I got to see all the pictures from our past few gatherings, and I am promised a burned picture cd at Tuesday's showing of Labrynth. :D Awesome! But many thanks go to Brad and Dan for last night. Seriously, thank you both. :D   I'm really kinda tired though, I hope that was a pretty accurate run down of the past two nights of Charmer social events. I hope it makes sense to all who happen to read, and hopefully pictures will be posted so you can see how awesome we are. ;D  urlLink Pictures posted! WARNING: ADULT CONTENT!
