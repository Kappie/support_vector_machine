His name is Tyler; very cute; white; 6 foot tall; in his late 20's or early 30's; a pretty boy type;  British looking like; body built; etc.    It isnt easy to train because its one hell of a job. I would say its very complicated to learn. But in and out after the first day of training, I must say that I liked this guy!!! He picks up just like that. His very brilliant who learns very quickly.  It's a piece of cake for him. Which gives me props and extra credits for being a great teacher :).  Today is Tyler's second day. Here I am sitting here doing my usual work and Tyler approached me. Since his so tall, he had to get down on bended knees and started to ask me questions. I eventually started to crack up. Never before has a man prospectively approached me this kind of way before. It's a very weird feeling but very glorious intentional. .
