I really wanted to surprise her with some guests and I just thought it would be fun. At first I felt bad, like I was inconveniencing them but Diane seemed to appreciate our little ambush. We watched parts of Jackass again because Matthew hadn't seen it yet. Ah, I loved the foghorn part....again. I can't get enough of that foghorn.
