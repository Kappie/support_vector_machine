I was driving on the freeway, and I had to slow down for a bus, this asshole behind me, riding my ass, had to get into the other lane to avoid hitting me. So when he passes, I see another middle-age man in the passenger seat. I start yelling and throwing my hands up and he glares. Then he sticks out his middle and pointer finger and does this flick-me-off type of gesture. EWWW can I just tell you that boys insurance used to be a lot higher than girls, because THEY ARE BAD DRIVERS! But, to be fair, they now made it equal. Oh it makes my blood boil!! Here are a few statistics I found:  "The male fatal crash involvement rate per 100,000 population was 3 times as high as for female drivers in 1994. Female drivers continue to exhibit safer driving statistics than male drivers. Males accounted for 67 percent of total fatalities, 68 percent of all pedestrian fatalities, and 86 percent of all pedalcyclist fatalities in 1994. 22 percent of male drivers involved in fatal crashes were intoxicated compared to 11 percent of female drivers. 37 percent of female drivers involved in fatal crashes were unrestrained at the time of the crash compared to 47 percent for male drivers involved in fatal crashes." (http://www.familycar.com/Driving/women.htm)   Overall, young drivers, and especially, young White males account for a large share of the alcohol-crash problem. (NHTSA, 2001) (http://www.madd.org/stats/0,1056,4648,00.html)  According to Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, women are less likely to be driving at night, to be driving impaired by alcohol, to be doing other things that are precursors to rollovers. It's statistically provable and very gender-specific. - (USA Today, 2001)(http://4wheeldrive.about.com/cs/forwomenonly/a/aa092202b_3.htm) GRRRR....BOYS SHOULD DIE. Anyways, Harry and Hermione were on TRL. She's really obnoxious. I'm really tired after today. The curve on the math exam was good. My resume looks like shit. Flag football was really hot today. I smell. Dancing was crazy... hip hop? How about some good, clean Indian dance?! AiLy drew a flower on my arm, and every time I see it out of the corner of my eye, I think it's a tattoo!! AHH! That's all, bye.
