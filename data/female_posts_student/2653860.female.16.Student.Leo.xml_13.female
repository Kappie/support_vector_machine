They were a really interesting read. I con't wait until next year. Cassie, do you know what Mrs. Ream is planning on doing next year for the fall play? I wondered because I want to audition. You never did tell me when the Outdoor Theatre was going on at the Richland Acadamy. I hope you guys are having an awesome summer. I am going to North Carolina on the 10th. I can't wait. The whole Winbigler side of the family is going down and we are renting a beach house for the week.   Spain was a lot of fun. I met three girls there. Their names are: Stasie, Aley, and Tiffany. They are from Bakersfield, California. They are going to be Sophomores in Bakersfield Christen High School. The only bad part was when Mrs. Connelly had a allergic reaction to something she ate and she had to go tot the hospital while we were there and we were without a teacher for a while. It was cool though because I hung out with the girls' group. I really didn't Mrs. Connelly that much. Mrs. Connelly and the two women that went with us and I decided that we would go up this mountain on cable cars. Well, I didn't, and probably the other two women didn;t either, but Mrs. Connelly said, after we got onto the cable cars, that she was afraid of heights. Well, after we got up the mountain, we realized that to get to the very top of the mountai, you have to climb stairs. Well, we started walking, now it was just Mrs. Connelly, the two older women and me, the guys decided that they wanted to stay at the beach, and of course all beaches in Europe are clothing optional. Well, about halfway walking up the steps, the two women decided that they would give up and wait for Mrs. Connelly and me. Mrs. Connelly is tough. She climbed that mountain without stopping. It was awesome.   I will have to tell you the rest of my stories of Spain later. B4N
