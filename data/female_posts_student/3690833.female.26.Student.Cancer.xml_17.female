(doesn't this guy have a job??)   i am tempted to ask him to help develop a schedule where i can enjoy my yard, and he can run a chainsaw, rip up the deck, blast country music,  say i get sun, mon and wed?  he can have tues, thurs, fri and sat???? pleeze???  i have altogether given up on the idea of a tan this summer.  i really don't feel comfortable laying out in my yard when he is over there.  that see through metal fence doesn't provide enough cover for me.   apparently the mrs. of the house has no such problems.  today,  her rotund form was doing a yoga routine that brought to mind the death of a beached whale.  bitch.  how come she can roll around imitating a gran mal seizure,  when i am not comfortable baking my flesh in my own (fairly expensive) backyard?   i told the Bf that he shoud belch, scratch his ass, and pee alot outside, in order to offend the offensive couple enough to put up a privacy fence.
