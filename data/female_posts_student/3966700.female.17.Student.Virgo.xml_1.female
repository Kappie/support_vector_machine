Like I dont wanna sound like a whiney lil 5 year old, But Its not like that at all. I just need to tell someone other then Jon how I feel just to say it and get it off my mind but It will never get off my mind cuz he is always on my mind like 24/7 I dont think I will ever stop loving him. But one day I will have to get over this block in my life. I will probably I did it once I can totally do it again. I think. Ne-ways enoughabout Jon. Even if I miss him alot. But Ne-ways I try to be a friend, I try to be there for everyone no matter what, But they never seem to open up I want them to know that No matter what I am right there, Just for them. And I will try my hardest to be there but you know you cant always be there ur not perfectnor Superman. No matter what you do one day you wont be there for them. Which sucks but its life. Or maybe they just dont want to talk about it or to you. Thats something I guess I will have to live with. I have to learn that I can always be everyones listener I need to have a turn to have a voice and not just judgement .. I have a VOICE TO bastarders! lol But most of the time I dont wanan talk about it so its all good. Maybe I just need to like deal with the fact that Its better for me to bottle up everything, seems better like that. I am happier if i just dont think about them... It works me thats all that counts. I just need to be myself and everything will be okies!:D hehe
