Henk's coming down tomorrow for Mothers Day.   I called Michelle just as I'd realized that the feelings haven't gone away. But they've faded. Maybe they'll be gone soon. I was completely retarded for him last night, I bet he doesn't read this. lol. I had a very vague conversation with her in front of Nick and Danny, because I was too lazy to leave the room.   We got drunk and it was fun, but the side effects are near killing me today. Did my drunken coffee table dance and what not. Leaving random messages on the voicemail of others. Nick jamming Melissa in her tit. Me making the Mike's Hard Lemonade 6-pack carton into a hat. Tackling people as they came across the field. And watching a drug / prostitution deal in action... I need to take a shower but again, I'm really fucking lazy. I don't understand how people can be motivated after a night like that, but I was trashed. At least I didn't puke.  I don't really know what happened with April but it would have been fun to party with her last night. We have a lot in common in regards to how we feel about each other... completely oblivious to what the other thinks. Ah.. it will be sorted out. I'm not worried about it.   I'm going to give Nick (Cantu) a call and chill with him this afternoon, more than likely. See what Michelle is up to. See what Tiki is up to. Possibly chill with Q. Seems like it'll be a pretty social day. I just need to "get my homework finished" so I can leave without my mom getting all pissy. I'm planting flowers tomorrow, but I'm too tired to do anything but sit on my ass and possibly drive today. I need to conserve money.   More to come later tonight or tomorrow or something.
