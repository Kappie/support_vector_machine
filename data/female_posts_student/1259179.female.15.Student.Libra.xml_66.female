She was a bit dehydrated.  They got her on a IV for 3 hours and took blood.  We didn't stay for the blood result to come back. We would still be there.  After 4 hours there, she looked and felt much better, she even kept her ice chips.   Yeaaaaaaa..  So we got back home and I went for a little nap...  3 hours later...Here I am now.  So on this Saturday evening, I am pooped........Be Good
