Why would you hurt them? And why would you do something to them that isn't just going to affect them at the time but for the rest of their lives?  The Bible says to " Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Ok so then all these sex offenders and all that, they want someone to fuck their lives up so bad that they'll never be just an innocent 16 year old? Or maybe their excuse is it happened to them when they were young. And that makes it ok to do it to someone else? I thought we were supposed to learn from our mistakes. Or from other's mistakes. And what about the child, are they supposed to forgive the molester? I mean if you're supposed to do unto others, then I forgive them because I want to be forgiven. Am I stupid? And another thing when that happens to you, you never forget. There will always be that one image in your head that you can't get out, until one day you can't deal with it anymore and you just make yourself numb so you won't have to. But is it ok for a person to live like that? I don't get it, I mean when you make yourself numb it's not just numbness to those memories, it envelopes everything you feel. How can a body live like that?
