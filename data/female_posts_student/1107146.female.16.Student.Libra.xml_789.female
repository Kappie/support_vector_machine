Not that I don't enjoy having monologues or talking to Linds, but it's just not the same, if you know what I mean.  But it's of little consequence. I've been with Abby for seven months today. Hasn't it seemed like about...I dunno, two? And a half, maybe? Aye. But nevertheless...she's still too amazing. It's hard to put out what I really want to say, I don't think there's any words for it.   Aye, I shan't trouble you with more o' my EMO kid rantings, no longer! Have a good weekend, everyone. I get to wake up early and bother rich people! And then, Antonio's with Abby, which should be very awesome. I have to think of something to do after that tho...hmm...And then...it's off to DKrik's Suicide Death Machine practice and SuperBowl Fun to the third power with Sethie, perhaps, on Sunday.  Arrivederchi for now, my kinspeople.
