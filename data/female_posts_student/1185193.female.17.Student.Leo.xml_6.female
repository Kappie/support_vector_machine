It started out horrible because I woke up at the regular time--6am--to leave for school at 7am.  Little did I know, there was a faculty/staff meeting and I could have slept in.  This would have been a good thing because I was awake all night last night.  My only time of relief from my illness last night was robbed from me.  It kind of set my whole day off lop-sided.  Plus, I had school from 8:30-2:35--my longest day of the week.  *sigh*  And then along came good.  Do you ever have one of those days that seems like it's from the t.v. series Cheers?..."Where everybody knows your name."  Okay, sounds kind of corny.  Yeah, really stupid.  But I'm talking about when you're strutting your stuff down the hallways at school and like everyone either gives you a pleasant smile or says, with enthusiasm, "Hi *insert name here*!"  And you've got your best outfit on, have an awesome hair and makeup day, and feel like you're walking on Cloud Nine.  Even better, you've got no homework due on Friday or Monday.  The sun is shining and everything seems to be clicking together perfectly, until...  You visit your doctor, and she gives you terrifying--and I mean teeth chattering--news about your present health condition.  She says if you have another one of those attacks that you'll have to be hospitalized. Eek!  Excuse my use of second person..one word: Denial.  Drum roll please...my last "good" of the day.  Bobby, Veronika and I went out to Chili's for dinner.  They serve some mean chicken tacos (guacamole added, of course).  And because of Shirlene and Steve, we ordered the Chocolate Molten Cake.  Yum!  After that, we drove to Veronika's home in Mountain View and visited with her mom, Aniko.  Aniko makes the best lemonade ever...EVER.    Anyhoo, since I got absolutely no sleep last night, I better get to bed.  Sweet dreams everyone!
