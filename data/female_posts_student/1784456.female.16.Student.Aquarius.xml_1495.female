My sis broke our bedroom door, so there was light coming thru, and my sis and dad were snoring and oh, it was dreadful, i finally got to sleep at 2:30am, and then joy of all joys, my sis woke me up this morning at 8 o'clock, refusing to get on the scales so that my parents could see how much she weighed. I then shouted very sarcasticly, Thanks for waking me up, and managed to wake my bro up aswell. And everyone's blaming me. I then found i have lost a pound in weight instead of putting it on and my dad ses it is because i have alot of nervous energy (will have to look up what that is in a min) and because i don't sleep very well. And he has finally admitted that i am not anorexic because i have eaten more than normal over these hols and have still managed to lose that pound. They wanna know the secret to losing weight but i don't know how i do it. be bck in a sec just gonna find out what nervous energy is............
