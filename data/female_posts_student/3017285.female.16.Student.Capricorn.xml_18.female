You know, when the sun's been shining all day and the air inside is sort of...moist, and warm, and it just  smells  like it's summer outside. I love it. In some weird unfathomable way it reminds me of Yoshi's Story on N64. Don't ask me why, it just does.  I just came back from the physiotherapist, and aparently I've been standing and walking the wrong way for..ever. Sheesh, knees, it's been 16 years, couldn't you have said something?! Oh wait, my knees can't talk... XD Or maybe getting inflamed is just their way of saying something. Anyway, I have to stop locking my knees when I stand. It feels all weird, like I'm going to fall over at any second because my knees are bent. I am now actually using muscles when I stand...'tis a n odd feeling.
