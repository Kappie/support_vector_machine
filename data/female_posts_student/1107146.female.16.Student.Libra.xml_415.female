So I bought a little notebook to analyse stuff like that and put other random stuff. For instance, starting today, in about three or four years, I could tell you what I had for breakfast... TODAY . I'll definitely be breaking that little cliché in no time.  I'm seriously diggin' Psycho-logy because it has less to do with facts and more with gut instinct and personal thought, and for some reason it's a really easy class to connect with. I've only been in there two days and it's my fav. ever.   Plus I've been thinking of being a shrink for a long time, so that just ices the fragging cake.  In other news...I was almost finished recording another song ( Problems ) and suddenly my room decided to have a problem of its own in the matter of voltage...the room is f0cking dead. Well sort of. It has to do with messing up my gain structure...or how much sound I can get without getting distorted. So right now, I can get almost no volume and all gain. So for what you hear, it's a little fuzzy buzz in the background. And it was going SO WELL! The gain was  PERFECT  on the drums, all I had to do was some decibel adjustments and now they sound GREAT. And the bass went  INCREDIBLY  too, it sounds really nice and I got a good reverb (sort of shower room echo, that's reverb) on it too...and some delay (takes part of the sound and broadcasts it a few seconds later) which makes it sound even better. And THEN...the   ALMIGHTY RIFF   that goes in the chorus along with accompaniment rhythm. So I was about to do the heavy guitars.  Eh? Why's the little bar-mahickey not going up?  For those of you less educated in musical terminology, "bar-mahickey" refers to the digital readout of gain I'm getting from the source signal, in this case, my guitar. Now you know, fools. HAHAH JK  It was really cool in Mrs./Ms. (married? I dunno) Bayrd's class today because she was making fun of Confederations and she talked about one going on in the 1980s. She believes that these people should look at past confederations and see the mistakes therein, but because they didn't, Mrs./Ms. Bayrd let go a booming, "FOOLS!" and continued on. So from now on, when I'm slightly peeved at someone or trying to be annoying, I shall be using the terms "YOU CAN GET BACK TO WORK!" and "FOOLS!" at whatever juncture necessary. Along with "w00t" and "downer", as Lindsey can attest that I did today, to Julian for some reason.   Julian didn't point out the fact that  Downer  is, in fact, a Nirvana song, and I thought he was the biggest Nirvana-head ever. He made fun of my cKy pin today and asked me if I liked EMO...wherever the hell he gets that cKy is EMO...plus, EMO is badass anyway, yo. Taking Back Sunday, for instance. ASS-BAD.  So guys, that's it. I'm really long winded and I should be shot with a gun or bow and killed. Thank you for your time.  This is J-Funk-Killa saying "PEACE!"
