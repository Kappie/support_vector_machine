At first I was really excited, and I still am, but then I realized that there are some people that I am really, really going to miss.  I'll be gone for five weeks, and then probably another for college visits, and that leaves me with five weeks at home spread out with two before I leave and three after.  I know that all the seniors are going to leave sometime, but it's getting here so quickly.  There are some people that I haven't gone 24 hours without seeing since the beginning of the year, and when they graduate, that will pretty much be it.  Senior year will be exciting, and I'm sure it's going to be fun, but I really like my life and the people in it right now.  I hadn't given much thought to the idea of not talking to these important people regularly; not seeing them at school, or outside of school.  I'm excited for them, and I hope they make new friends, but I will really miss them, and adjusting to life without them seems like it's going to be tough.
