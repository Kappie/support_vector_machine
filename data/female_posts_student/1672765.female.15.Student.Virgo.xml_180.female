It makes me tired and I always get burnt. And I get hot and I don't like being hot. I just prefer shade or indoors or cloudy weather.   I finished the Cadfaels. If you don't know Cadfael it originally was this series of books by Ellis Peters then they made 13 of the books into movies for Public TV. I'm a big fan I love the show and we own all 13 movies. I hadn't seen them in a long time, not since I was pretty young and I decided I'd watch one a while ago and then I ended up watching them all. I like the first series best because I think Hugh Barranger is played the best then. I don't really care for the guy who plays him in the 2nd and 3rd season, the 4th season guy is alright. But in the 4th season Oswin disappears and he's like the greatest so that was disappointing but still they are really good.   Anyway I'm sure if anybody read that that was really boring.
