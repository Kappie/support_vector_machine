I'm looking forward not o miss it, since my ever-so-smart mom scheduled a doctor appointment for me at 14:30, and the game begins at 15:30 (14:30 Aly and Beebz's time). Oh yes, and if you do watch, pay attention to Giba. That guy  was  cute, but for some odd reason he let his hair grow that much and did the same with his facial hair... So now I just have to keep my eyes on Dante and Ricardinho, specially the last one (it's written RICARDO on his shirt). Anyway... Who do you think is gonna win ?       P.S: I'm feeling really stupid posting for the 3rd time in a row here...
