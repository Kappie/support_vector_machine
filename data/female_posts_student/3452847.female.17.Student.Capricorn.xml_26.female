Because i know there is a good side to it, but one thing that is irritating me is he will not listen to me. The engagement, was something to me totally unexpected, a total suprise, but something i had to stop and think about, and i did a lot of thinking about it. I had to say no because i didn't want to end up breaking off an engagement as well as a relationship going down the pan. That is something i really didn't want to have. Basically i decided that i couldn't do it, it was my decision, and at 16 nearly, a pretty big one to have to face. Hes so off with me, he can't talk to me, hes guilty about what happened, but at the end of the day he wanted it or he wouldn't have done it. He can't keep pretending, and i still think he isn't telling the truth, and he can't keep avoiding me, its her he should be feeling shit towards not me. It was his idea for christs sake, both times, i just happened to say yes, which was stupid. With a name like love - the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket, he must be either trying to make a point or pissed off too.  He can't talk about the engagement, and i needed to, but we weren't allowed as he didn't want to, did he not think it was going to affect me too? Didn't think i cared about it? Its one of the most important moments of my life, all because it was the wrong time and we both know it meant that it had to end, we had to end. I also think he still has issues with us as well, he so blatantly hasn't moved on properly or he wouldn't have changed the topic to us, i was talking about now, him and her, who i now feel very sorry for. She doesn't deserve to be cheated on twice and she when she finds out as i'm sure she will eventually she is going to hate me but i do still think its best she knows. I guess nothing can be changed now, and with time me and Jason will hopefully go back to talking properly, i wish Tom was here i always talk to him and he always helps me out, i'll have to see him when he gets back, i just wish someone would have listened to me about how i felt, wish he would have listened, its still something that swims round my mind, what if, what would have happened, would i be happy? what now?   ~Lisa~
