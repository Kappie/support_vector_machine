I usually despise going there b/c not only is it very hot during the summer but it's usually barren and lifeless with zombie-like shoppers and rude salespeople (at least at their Billabong store). Great place...but today was a little different, we found a lil cafe called Aruba that was hidden in a corner. It was nice, small business, nicely decorated in a tropical, friendly theme. Nice sandwiches too (lol I need another adjective). And much better than Dairy Queen, which is the only other food place in the there. I've decided to postpone my permit test till Monday morning b/c I forgot to study for it...I didn't want to cram either. Hell, I even forgot it was Thursday. I only remembered when Ryan told me about our piano lessons today and I had checked my cell to make sure. ::sigh:: I was behind a day in my head...how hopeless is that? School starts in around two weeks...maybe then I'll regain my consciousness of time.
