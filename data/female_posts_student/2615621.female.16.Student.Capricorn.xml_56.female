I LOVE U!! lol ok good mood right now. im tired of the same bs day after day. the fake friendships (catherine and sometimes katie and gitt..and u know the usual) and the fake smiles and hellos. im tired of putting up with cat's comments on how im just being nice and friends with "more popular kids just so i can social climb" i think i can be friends with whoever i damn well please catherine. if falon runs up to me and says hey and i say hey back, back off and dont call me a social climber. ugh. just cuz she isnt nice to u doesnt mean she cant be nice to be and just because u put her up on some throne and say "ooo shes so popular" then thats ur problem there. ugh. GRRRR ok im good now. haha and im hungry and i have to go play a soccer game tonite and its cold and its gonna rain and its not gonna be much fun. lol what happened to my good mood? idk. haha BUT i do have this awesome senior quote i cant wait to use in 2 years!!! "we may win and we may lose but we'll never be here again" - The Eagles yay!!! haha ok ne ways im gonna bounce (lol oook) adios!
