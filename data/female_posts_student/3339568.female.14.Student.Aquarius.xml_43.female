My feet, back and every single muscle imaginable aches, but it was worth it.  I danced for 5 and 1/2 hours yesterday, no joke.  But Hannah W and I finally finished our dance for Performing Arts!  We'd been practicing every lunchtime for the whole week, fighting off people to rights to the  only  CD Player in the school, danced all night last night, and perfected the rest today.  It's a combination of hip-hop, jazz and our combined gymnastics abiltity :P I'm really happy with it.  We've also got our costumes downpat. I'm really excited, and really happy with our effort, we deserved this.
