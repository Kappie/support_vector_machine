O.O  yes, that's right kids.    wanted to take a pix. but mom brought the camera to mexico. XP! no evidence. so tecnically, everything i said above could be a lie...     and i look REALLY different.   ^___^    9 days without my mother... CAN YOU BELIEVE IT! *whoops and does a funky dance* she went with my confirmation class to mexico *bursts out laughing* that I was supposed to go on... (but obviously didn't... hate the lot of then any ways... stupid bowditch kids...)   watched  the fugitive  with my dad and brother...  and thats all. ^.^   patty
