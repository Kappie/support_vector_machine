i really cant leave yet. ive wanted this for so long. i still can remember when i was in 5th grade and i wanted to badly to go to middle school. when i started going to judson i realized that i hated it. this is confusing. i just want to stay. ive just decided that i want to make an 8th grade memory book because i feel like i need to remember this year. that would be a great summer project for me. i'll know ill still be thinking about judson. i cant belive its time to go already.   as im sitting here, im thinking of all of the great things that have happened this year. fist of all, i finally got to be in musical theatre this year. it was one of the best experiences of my life to be in annie. that play was the best. after it all, i still think most of the people in my class as their characters because we made it seem that it was real. i'll never forget annie.   choir is definately my favorite class. i love everything about it. it feels like we all grew really close this year and so much that it feels like were a huge 80 person family! i was also in jazz choir this year too. ive decided that i really like jazz music now because of jazz choir. we went to pleasant hill jazz festival and got 3rd place. it was fun but kind of dissapointing at the same time because only 1st and 2nd moved on to the finals. but im still grateful to have gotten 3rd. that was the firt festiavl that i had been in that we have placed at, so it was a very specail day for me. concert choir was also greta this year. we went to best in the northwest and we placed 4th. it was teh ebst because it was the first time that one of ms andersons choirs had won. we also beat crossler! :-) i am going to be in concert choir next year at south and hopefully ill be in jazz etc. thats one of the reasons why im still up right now. choir is really important to me and ill never forget it.   last night was the 8th grade dance. it was one of the best times i have ever had. but it was also one of the most depressing times. it almost was like showing me a glimpse of the last day of school. happy but sad at the same time. it was so sad to see all my classmates and to think i wont see most of them for a long time. why does the school district do this to us? i dont understand how people can do this to us. its not fair. they can all go die for all i care. anyways i went to the dance with kaila, paul, daniel, ashley and bryant. paul paid like 200 dollars to rent a limo for us. hes so sweet. i had a great time with them. at the dance i got to slow dance with paul, daniel, jantsen and dan. haha dan. it was so fun. guys can be very nice sometimes. :-) i loved that dance and i wish it had never ended. everyone looked so good. they said that you dont need to dress that formal, but everyone did anyway and it was great. people that i had never seen dressed up really suprised me. like stacy, she looked BEAUTIFUL! she had a really pretty dress on and her make up looked really nice. everyone looked great and it felt almost like a family reunion. i tryed to forget the fact thta it was bascialy a farewell party. that part was the worst to think about. i seriously wish it had never ended.   some random things that happened this year were: i was in the act of kindness group. we did nice things for people and projects to help others out and at the end we had a dessert party and we got certificates. i accually enjoyed health class this year. it was a great group of people and mrs. norris was a great teacher. in p.e, i got 30 on the pacer. i was so proud thatg i pushed myself that hard. i like to accomplish things that i only can dream of doing. it feels great at the end. i got passing grades in math this year. now thats suprising!   today was field day and i just decided to sign yearbooks the entire time. my yearbook is getting pretty full. it was kind of sad to be signing yearbooks because it reminded me that we were leaving. and i mean, what do you say to people you have known your entire life that you have to leave? ive got most of the signatures i want but i dont think im done yet. tomorrows gonna be so much harder.   well its about 1:00am now and i probably need to wrap this up. but im definately gonna write tomorrow because i never want to forget it. its gonna be awesome. i still am having trouble letting go. i cant even imagine how much im going to miss everyone. ik love everyone so much and tomorrow, saying goodbye will be so sad. i hope i dont cry because it might happen. i cant do this.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   yeah....pretty long i know. but i felt like i needed to write it. ill write my last day one later.   i love you all and ill never forget you.   ~alyssa kelsy~
