My aunt, who was my sister, my best friend, the person who I was closest to for a long time, was murdered last year. Her killer still walks free. We all know that it was her boyfriend, Ed, or his psyco siter, Yvonne.  Yet the cops sit on their ass instead of getting some evidence to fucking charge them. Its been way too long.    They were going to marry. He said that he loved her, if he loved her as much as he said did, then why in the fucking blue hell is he covering for himself and/or his fucking sister? He told us he saw a fucking van..showed me what kind of van it was, tried to get me to believe him. At the time, I probably did believe what he told me. I didn't want to believe that him--this man that Twylia loved could have anything to do with her death. Maybe I was wrong. Then Yvonne and her fucking stories. I never did like her. I never believed a word she said. Her latest story that she woke up in the back of the car when it was all over. Bull-fucking-shit. No one believes her silly ass.     I don't know what to believe anymore.  I don't know anything. Remember, I'm just a kid.  What I think doesn't matter. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, they don't listen to me.  Twylia Dawne Walls had just turned 21 when she was murdered. She had turned 21 on April 26, 2003. She was killed May 15, 2003.  Nothing has been done about this.  But if you think that I and the rest of her family and friends and everyone that loved her ( and thats a whole lot of fuckin people, let me tell ya) are just going to sit around and wait for nothing to happen, you don't know me too well. I'm gonna raise hell. I'll throw a fucking hissy fit,(not that I haven't already.) Twylia was my best-friend, I miss her so much. I cry everyday knowing that she's gone, and she never got the chance to live her life. I will make sure something is done about this. If I have to kill the bastard myself--something will be done. Yeah, I maybe just a kid, but like I said, I'm a bitch, I'll make sure something happens.  Life is Beatiful, but short. Live it to the fullest!~Jane Walls  In Loving Memory of Twylia Dawne Walls. April 26, 1982-May 15, 2003.  No Farewell Words Were Spoken No Time To Say Goodbye, You Were Gone Before We Knew It and Only God Knows Why.
