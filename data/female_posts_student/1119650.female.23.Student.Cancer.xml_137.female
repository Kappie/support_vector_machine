They're not promoting abstinence, they're not handing out condums in the schools, oh no my friends, they're reaching out to the under 16 student population and promoting  ORAL SEX   Thats right, 10,000 students in Britain's secondary schools are participating in a program called  urlLink A Pause , which promotes experimentation with oral sex in an effort to reduce the number of kids engaging in sex and in turn reducing the British teen-pregancy rate, the highest in Western Europe.    I want them to put these Pause teachers out on the front-line in our pending war with Iraq.  Send them out as missionaries to the uptight Muslim coutries in the world, let them know the wonders of the oral treats...they'll lighten up.  No one can be unrelaxed while getting treats, forget all these disarming resolutions we're trying to pass in the U.N.   Oral is the real key to the peace process.  All we are saying is give b.j.'s a chance.   Thanks to Kooky's away message for this story
