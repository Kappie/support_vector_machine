I had to change into my flares and put a jumper on! What's happened?!?! If it's freezing tomorrow then I won't be a happy bunny, well I guess being cold in Bristol is better than melting and dying of a splitting head ache while hoppign from drink stand to drink stand. Hmm... better over exagerated? Nope! Hehe, I better go practise Grade 4 piano, I've got my exam soon! Noooo!
