I hope that this person will give me a call at some point today when they have time.   Days plan: Shopping with the mother, BQ for my brother Josh who is moving to Atlanta with his girlfriend Laine, then I suspect nothing.  Last night I actually got to play pool. I have actually gotten better. Everytime someone left me with solids I did horribly for some reason. I always tried to sink the 15 ball first, and whenever I did, I seemed to have a better game. I am so weird lol.   Anyways, keeping it short...I hope you have a good day!    ::sunburn...ouch...at least I wore a hat yesterday...but my shoulders are killing me!::
