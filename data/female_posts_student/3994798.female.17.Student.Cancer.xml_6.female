I don't understand why everyone can't just get along. Old friends talking behind people's backs and betraying others...people just spreading rumours and being so incredibly horrible to each other. I dont understand people like that.    Yeah Jen and Janice, it's so funny how she still cares so much...and we're just like "yeah wutever. you don't matter." lol...wut a bitchoid. :P I think i should stay faaaaaar away from mean people right now...i might do something i'll regret later on in my life...like commit murder. *ahem*    I'm also having boy troubles...there's this guy that i just dont get. He's so friggin hard to read and i can't understand why he does the things he does half the time. It's soooo annoying :( he's such a monkey :P (hehe tash)    I went to jen's and played DDR today with janice, ryan and bog-->Aww bogz looked sooo cute and so did ryan...silly ryan. Wowza though that shit makes you so tired. I'm like dead now. I also roasted in the sun walking to her house. mmmm..roasting. lol :) Yeah well..i think i might go take a nap, watch t.v., or eat chocolate...all of which are sorely tempting at the moment. :DBye for nooooow
