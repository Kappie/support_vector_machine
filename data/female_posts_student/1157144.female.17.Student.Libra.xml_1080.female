Animal Style - Your burger is cooked with mustard and instead of raw onions they are sautéed. Extra pickles and extra "special sauce" complete the order.  Animal Style Fries - Fries with cheese, sauce, and grilled onions.  Choco-Vanilla Swirl Shake - You get the idea.  Double Meat - A Double Double without the cheese.   Flying Dutchman - Two beef patties cooked medium rare. Add two slices of cheese and that’s it. Not even a bun!  Fries well done - Extra, extra crispy fries.  Grilled Cheese - No meat, just melted cheese, tomato, lettuce, and sauce on a bun.  Home Run - When a car passes by the microphone without ordering and stops at the service window.   Neapolitan Shake - A custom blend of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry shakes.   On the Sal - Lettuce and dressing. Yes, that’s really it.  Protein Style - Lettuce is wrapped around the burger instead of a bun.  Wish Burger or Veggie Burger - No meat, no cheese. Just a bun, lettuce, tomato, and special sauce.  2 by 4 - Two beef patties with four slices of cheese.  3 by 3 - Three beef patties with three slices of cheese.  4 by 4 - Four beef patties with four slices of cheese. 4 by 6 - Four beef patties with six slices of cheese.  (Actually you can get a burger with as many meat patties or cheese slices as you want. If you want 4 pieces of meat and 8 pieces of cheese tell them you want a 4-by-8.)  3 by Meat - Three meat patties and no cheese.
