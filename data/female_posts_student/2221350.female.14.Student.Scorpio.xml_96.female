I'M GOING TO MY DAD'S AND THAT'S FINAL.  all i have to do is not explode until this weekend when i leave. i will miss my cat and guitar lessons, but not so much that i would want to stay in this hellhole town with these awful people.  i was thinking the other day when i was watching E! that i think they should pass a law saying that you can't get married unless you've known that person 2 years. it's crazy the number of people who know eachother for 3 weeks and then get divorced after 2 weeks. i should be the president...  speaking of president, kerry's going to win and that sucks. yeah, i'm a republican, and even though i don't like bush as a person, because he's well, a dumbo, he still represents my party. but he's too stupid and he's dug himself a big hole and kerry's going to win.   i thought this was just too good not to post. if you're republican, read it, if you're democrat, REALLY read it.  THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER  REPUBLICAN VERSION (or traditional version)  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.  Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed.  The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold.  DEMOCRAT VERSION (or the "new version)      The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.  Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.allowed to suffer so?  Then a representative of the NAGB (The National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with green bias, and the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism.  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings "It's Not Easy Being Green." Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers.      Richard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an mmediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share." Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act" retroactive to the beginning of the summer.  The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs.  Having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, the ant's home is confiscated by the government.   Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a Defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal hearing officers that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3PM.      The ant loses the case.  The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it.  The ant has disappeared in the snow.  And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of Democrats announcing that a new era of "fairness" has dawned.
