(from -5 to +5) Friday: +3 Saturday: +5 Sunday: +3 Monday: WHO KNOWEWSOWS?!!!  Well it's already 2:30 and so far it's been kinda really dull and unpleasant. Stupid Mallorie was being weird when I had to go pick her up from her friend Shana's b-day party, and she wasn't ready and they wanted me come in to play DDR which I suck at and don't like, and I hadn't taken my shower and was very tired and cranky and didn't even want to get out of the car but of course because she never answers her cell phone I had to go to the door in my pajamas, then she got all pissed off at me because i was being "unpleasant", well excuse me I'm so sorry for going out of my way to pick your 18 year-old ass up. She needs to get her damn license! It's been like 5/6 of a year since I've gotten mine and my older sister still doesn't have hers, and actually hasn't improved on driving skills either cause she never asks to drive when she goes places, which is not that often. Wow I'm rambling and you guys don't care. But this is my outlet so DEAL WITH IT. Hm i'm not in a good mood today. So far it's -1.
