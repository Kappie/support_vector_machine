I got a BOTAR shirt that has a nice guitar with wings on it and... A Streetlight Manifesto poster. Its kind of tiny but I don't love it any less. I got an ASOB CD also. After all this time of me being at shows they played at I finally got one.  The bands...  I felt bad for the first bad. They wanted to be good but didnt want to be good bad enough... They were called the Malibu Boyscouts or something along the lines of that. Really off with their playing. The vocalist kept missing the mic a good portion of the time too.  High School Football Heroes. I'm not a fan of these guys. I've seen them a couple of times live I just dont like them.  ASOB wasn't as good as usuall. It was obvious they were just playing just to play. They did do a crappy cover of a Taking Back Sunday song... I forget the name.  Big D. Just like last time I saw them, they really gave me a shock. new how to communicate with the crowd... Not just talk to the crowd as a whole but to everyone. Played Dirt Lip and a couple others. Can't wait to see them again.  STREETLIGHT MANIFESTO!!! Everything I dreamed of(everynight since I found out they were playing) and more! They played A Moment of Silence, A Moment of Violence, Everything Went Numb, A Better Place A Better Time, Point-Counterpoint, Failing Flailing, The Big Sleep and a couple of others. Only band I went into the pit for. These guys come second on the best show I've ever seen, headed by Catch 22 of course.  I didn't know that anyone was going to the show. I figured I would go there and be alone but I saw Erika and Jamie and I met Rob so I had people to hang out with. Erika and Jamie left towards the end of Streetlight Manifesto and I have no idea where Rob went, but when I left the Downtown Erika and Jamie were outside. Dad called and he was a wee bit angry. Oh well, It was worth not following his bull shit curfew that I don't follow anyway so I could stay for the last song... Drivers Ed. Tommorow. Should be fun.
