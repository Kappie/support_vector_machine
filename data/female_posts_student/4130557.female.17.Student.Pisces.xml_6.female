My Love:  My love is like an ocean It goes down so deep My love is like a rose Whose beauty you want to keep.  My love is like a river That will never end My love is like a dove With a beautiful message to send.  My love is like a song That goes on and on forever My love is like a prisoner It's to you that I surrender.   Love Me:   Love me in the Springtime, when all is green and new, Love me in the Summer, when the sky is oh so blue, Love me in the Autumn, when the leaves are turning brown, Love me in the Winter, when the snow is falling down.  Love me when I'm happy, and even when I'm sad, Love me when I'm good, or when I'm oh so bad, Love me when I'm pretty, or if my face is plain, Love me when I'm feeling good, or when I'm feeling pain.  Love me always darlin', in the rain or shining sun, Love me always darlin', after all is said and done, Love me always darlin', until all our life is through, Love me always darlin', for I'll be lovin' you!    Loves Mystery:  Love is like magic And it always will be. For love still remains Life's sweet mystery!! Love works in ways That are wondrous and strange And there's nothing in life That love cannot change!! Love can transform The most commonplace Into beauty and splendor And sweetness and grace. Love is unselfish, Understanding and kind, For it sees with it's heart And not with it's mind!! Love is the answer That everyone seeks.... Love is the language, That every heart speaks. Love can't be bought, It is priceless and free, Love, like pure magic, Is life's sweet mystery!!   Love...   Love is like a lump of gold, Hard to get, and hard to hold. Of all the guys I've ever met, You're the one I can't forget. I do believe that God above, Created you for me to love. He chose you from all the rest, Because he knew I would love you best   I Will Love You Forever...  I love you so deeply, I love you so much, I love the sound of your voice And the way that we touch. I love your warm smile And your kind, thoughtful way, The joy that you bring To my life every day. I love you today As I have from the start, And I'll love you forever With all of my heart.   I Love You...   It’s all because of you I’m feeling sad and blue You went away now my life is just a rainy day I love you so How much you’ll never know You’ve gone away and left me lonely  Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me Of love so true That once turned all my gray skies blue But you’ve disappeared Now my eyes are filled with tears I’m wishin’ you were here with me  Soft with love are my thoughts of you Now that you’re gone I don’t know what to do  If only you were here You’d wash away my tears The sun would shine And once again you’d be mine all mine But in reality You and I will never be ‘Cause you took your love away from me If only you were here then you could see just how much I love you, And how much I care!  those are almost...ALMOST all my love poems... well I'll write lata...
