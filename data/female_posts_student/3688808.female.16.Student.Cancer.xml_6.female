I'd just woken up and couldn't quite process what she was saying but she sounded upset and asked me to meet her in town, so I did.   I met up with her at 1.30 and she told me what was wrong. Apparantly Luke was being a twat again and said some un-called-for things to her the night before. They were both hammered at the time though, but there was still no need for what he said.   Jade and I walked around town for a while and I walked her halfway home while we wrapped our arms around eachother and sang like drunken pissheads.   I caught the bus home, only to discover that I'd been locked out and everyone had pissed off to Mansfield, oh the irony! I went around to Vinnis to see if I could crash there for a bit but nobody answered the door. I totally refused to sit outside in the freezing cold and wait for everyone to get back, so I made a   plan.   I grabbed the ladder from the side of the house and propped it against the living room window which happened to be open. I tried to climb through the window and failed, and my new neighbours called the police because they thought I was breaking in! Perfection....   7.30 came around quick and Richard called for me. To be honest I was totally dreading going out since the last time Richard called for me. Richard, Shelly, Liam and me ended up sitting in Liam's new jeep with the windows wound down blasting sixties tunes through the speakers. Liam can't legally drive yet so he just drove up and down Richard's drive, intentionally destroying all of his dad's garden plants. XD   A load of us went down the meadows and messed about on the rope swing. It suited me down to the ground because Zoe had a load of fags that she needed to get rid of before she went home, so she ended up crashing them out to everyone.   It was absolutley freezing so we all decided to make a fire by setting fire to a bunch of paper with Rich's lighter. It didn't last too long though! We were being rained on so everyone decided to walk back up to the village. On the way there, walking through the fields, Shelly jumped on Richard's back and he carried her through. I asked what she was doing and she said that she didn't want to get attacked by snakes or rats.   This statement obviously made me squeal and start pegging it as fast as I could through the fields like a retard. That's the joy of being me I suppose.   Richard and Shelly walked me home, I got in and a few hours later I started talking to Len and managed to piss him off. Hopefully he won't hate me for too long. That's all for tonight children
