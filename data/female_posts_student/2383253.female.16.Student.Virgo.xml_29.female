Now, at 2 in the morning, I'm left with the fucking Teen Issue Presentation for PALs. Irony of ironies, it's on STRESS AND STRESS RELIEF. It'll be great tomorrow while we're talking to people about how not to be stressed and I'm standing up there looking like a crackhead. I should actually try to DO some of the stuff that I'm finding, but no. Instead I'm stressing about...a stress presentation. PALs sucks in this aspect. We're supposed to counsel people. Not present to classes of students what they don't care to hear in the first place. Staring at a computer screen used to make me very tired, but it has woken me up a little. Maybe it's just the temperature downstairs. It's so hot in my room...or maybe it's just the coffee I drank up there. I don't know. Either way, tomorrow will be a tired day. Thank goodness I'll only have the Physics to do. Man, this year is wearing me out. I picked up some more prep books today...4 in total, I think. The lady at Barnes and Noble was like "Cram time?" Affirmative.  Good night, all. Or rather good morning. Whatever.
