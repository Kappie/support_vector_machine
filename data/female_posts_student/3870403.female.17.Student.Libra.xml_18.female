NO NOT a REAL one, a henna tattoo. it was a very spiritual experience. i was like,  whoa . henna. then some random ass dude came outta nowhere and was like,  is that weed? is that hemp?  the lady doing the tattoo was like,  no it ain't hemp. what an idiot. whould ya look at this guy? what a IDIOT!  can you use weed to color your skin? no? didn't think so. OH... and i never did get my hair done.
