Jesse is doing good, as far as I can tell and they are keeping him busy enough so I am very happy for that, even though it interferes with our chat time.   The days get closer to me leaving for Anaheim with my mom, her boyfriend, and my two nephews. We are scheduled to leave Sacramento sometime around 6:00 am Saturday morning and are set to return sometime on Tuesday. We will be spending one day at Knots berry Farm (Sunday) and one day in Disney Land (Monday). I am so happy about going but at the same time I am not too sure I am going to be able to enjoy my trip because I know I will be thinking about Jesse, like I do so often.  Tonight my mom and I are going to Target to buy some snack foods and other things for the trip. I know once we get there I probably wont have time to even worry about how Jesse is doing but at the same time that is what I am afraid of. I know if Jesse were here he would tell me to go, enjoy my trip. He would tell me that I need to get away and I should treat myself for my birthday. I know deep down that’s what I should do, but at the same time I don’t understand how anyone can possibly have fun when they have been placed into a situation like I have.  I know all Jesse wants me to do is have a good birthday and to treat myself to a good time…but really all I want for my birthday is Jesse to be home.
