Yesterday was the best. I went to the 8th Annual Day in the Zone and scored me the autographs of the members of the band LIVE.  As seen pictured here:    This is the first time I have ever gotten anyoneâ€™s autograph ever and I plan to make a keepsake picture out of it once I get some pictures of the band members.  I also got to talk to Jesse a little bit on the phone yesterday. It is always so good to hear his voice, I just whish he was home now and not later. I miss him so much. On Saturday I got to be a part of an event that involved the BIA (Building Industry Association), it was called Boxes for Builders. It involved several local building companies and tons of nonperishable goods and toiletries to be sent to all of the soldiers of A, B and HHC Company of the 319th Sig Bn. I go to be a part of the effort and in a little over two hours 500 boxes were filled, labeled and pilled up ready to be shipped to our soldiers.   As part of the HHC and Editor for our newsletter I am going to do a little write-up for the event and I want to share my feelings about what these people did for our guys and gals over in the giant sandbox.   I had the busiest but best weekend ever.
