And he has this volume fluctuation problem. He's sounds like a kamikaze pilot that can't decide whether to die or not.   Keep your eye on the prize, man, that's all I'm saying. Skee really doesn't matter past money, and he doesn't furnish much of it anyway, so forget him. And Adams...that Adams. The guy is just crazy, it's because he's getting to be senile early since everyone wants to be friends with him. I don't know, it's just one of those weird things in nature or whatnot. But hey, maybe Skee will have a sudden random hand spasm while driving one day during the summer and the council minus Skee will fall under the control of Bayrd or Adams or someone cooler.  Yarp. Um, wow. Apple pie is really great, I'm going to pay for this later, said the Anorexia, but it's worth it, a lot, said the Mindless Self-Indulgence. Balance, she is a tricky sort.
