Sorry guys but have been stupidly busy this week and am my room is covered with boxes and piles (apparently you can get medical treatment for this though). My mum is coming up tomorrow to move some of my stuff to a friends house until the 1st July (CANADA DAY!!!) when I can move in to my house - which let me point out has broadband so there will be no excuses then.  She is taking some stuff home and the rest I need for "nav camp" which I'm departing for on Saturday.  So I'm afriad that next week there will be NO blogging at all. Sorry to disappoint.  Its after midnight yet again, so am going to try and go to bed. Oh watched the film The Piano last night when i couldn't sleep - VERY odd film has anyone ever seen it?  xx
