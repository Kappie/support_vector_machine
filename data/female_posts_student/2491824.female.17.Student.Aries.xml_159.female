Keep in mind I did these very, very late at night, and that I am left-handed using a right-handed mouse... :)        A purdy heart.    Some circles.    A leaf in all its leafy goodness.    Two people fighting. Do you see it? ...I'm not even sure that I do... Actually, the more I look at it, the more it looks like an archer.       A pretty flower...       I forgot what I was orginally trying to do with this one, but I screwed it up so I smeared the paint around with the palette knife........       A chick's body... This turned out much better than I thought it would...
