I arrived around 5 and I remember Ashley, Daylin, Mike, Jake, and Craig "leading back" to that Fat Joe song..(haha...I remember doing that with Ash and Day at Kennywood). Then people got hungry and Ashley and I made brownies..and I bought everyone wings from this place a few miles away. So since not of us had our linese, Daylin, Craig, and Mike rode 4-wheelers to the place (I mean this is Centerville we're talking about..haha). Well..halfway there one of the 4-wheelers ran out of gas so they came back and got gas. The wings were good and we ate outside in the nice weather. After that everyone (except me that is) rode 4-wheelers in the woods. Personally, I don't like 4-wheelers..and they kept trying to run me over!! So yeah..I played with the dogs outside..and they got into a mud fight. Thanks goodness I wasn't involved in that because I didn't have anything extra to wear except my bathing suit. After that I had to be all "mother" like and hose them off and doing little jobs for them. After that we got in the hot tub..since it was outside we were under the stars and we listened to the radio (haha..Mike and Jake like to sing to Jessica Simpson!). After that we watched "Sleepy Hollow". That was a creepy movie..and I must admit Johnny Depp was pretty hot..haha. Then Craig's dad took me, Mike, and Jake home. Today I had to work all day..and that was it..haha..nothing exciting. Tommorrow..staff party at the REC..yeah! Later...;)
