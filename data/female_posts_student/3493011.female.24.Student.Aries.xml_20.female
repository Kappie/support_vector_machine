Procrastination is such a key characteristic of every Arts student. Now is 8pm and I'm still feeling shitty and not wanting to write or read... not that I don't want to but stuff juz can't come out and I'm getting sick of my topic... THE MALE BODY.. bootalicious huh...  I need some jumpstart to THIS!!! Arggggggghhhhhhhh hate it... I'm frustrated with myself but ironically there is a sense of calmness in me I do not know why... I wish that false illusion of everything's gonna be fine at the end of the day gets dispel... Hey, can this be God's way of comforting my demented soul.. I suppose without this calmness in me I wld hav cried earlier on and juz give up but no tears... How weird.. maybe later...  I feel like sleeping but no I muz do my wrk... I want my mummy and I want peeps to be wif me to kiss me and touch my head, saying "You can get it done, I'll accompany you"... But well, such is life... you can't ask for more...  Light-headed now... shld I sleep??
