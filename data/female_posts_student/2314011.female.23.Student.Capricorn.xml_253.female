Be damned if I can remember her name, but she wanted to say 'hey' because she's relatively new in town and it was months before she found a gang of friends.    "So when I see a fresh face....it's kinda clique-ish around here..." (which is totally true; everyone knows everyone who walks in the place.  But it seems friendlier than the place a block away.) "It's hard to break in and make friends sometimes..."  I explained I'm from here originally, even though I'm up north now as she inched toward her car.  She said something about something else I can't remember as she left...something about me being familiar with something.  God, what happened to all those journalism skills?    Think she was talking to her significant other during the last post, but I'm definitely enjoying all this "I remember what it was like for me when I used to do what you're doing and I just wanted to be nice and say hi" stuff I've received from cute lesbians lately.       This place is about to close, but it's too early to start scoping out the bar.  Suppose the front porch will have to do.
