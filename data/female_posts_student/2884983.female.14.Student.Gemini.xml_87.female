No one will ever know all of the things you think about, not even if you tell them, they won't know everything. We all get born alone and we all die alone. "   but really no matter how you look at it, it stays the same because in reality it is true. you  cant get around it and you cant beat it. there isnt a way. and if there is and you find it could you please tell me?   Goddess Bless.
