Today I had lunch with a good friend of mine. I've not really had a chance to talk to him in a while. It's nice to catch up. But sometimes things seem so strange between us now. We get along great but it's strange to see the different people we've become.  Well enough about that. I think I'm gonna fix some pics, write a little bit, and then I'll try to post some stuff later.
