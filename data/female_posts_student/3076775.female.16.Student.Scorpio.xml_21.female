She's showing me the pictures that she has from camp.  Today was pretty good. Actually, today was very good. I got out of 1st and 1/2 of 2nd block today because the entire 10th grade went on this field trip to Athens High School. It was pretty fun.  School was terribly boring though. The best part of school was probably break, cuz I got to see my friends. (especially you know who...*wink wink* you know who you are!!!) Well, I gotta go.  Love, Shannon  So what if the sky was purple instead of blue?
