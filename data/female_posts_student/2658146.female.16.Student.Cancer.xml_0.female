I can't go to Fantasy Shop Friday, no biggie, I wasn't going anyway, but the fact that I got grounded really pisses me off.  I have a presentation tonight in Ethics. I hate ethics. I just went over the rubric again and found out I'm missing a bunch of stuff. Yarr.  I still think Dave and I have some issues. He's too uptight sometimes. I wish he would just sit back and chill for a while. He needs a break. Badly.  I started watching GTO yesterday. Got through the second episode, then Boots showed up.  I accidentally deleted my massive hangman game project. I worked fripping hard on it, and my teacher had just fixed all the bugs yesterday too. Crap on a stick.  I talked to Sez, she's going to make an overhead for me tomorrow for my Spanish side-project. I want to start painting it now, I'm so psyched about having my poster done.  I'm absolutely exhausted. Took those allergy pills this morning before school, and they kicked in during Algebra. In the middle of a problem, too. I'm so drowsy. I'm hungry too. Had a bagel for breakfast, but I guess it didn't fill me up.  Yarr, everyone keeps taking my computer in the spectra room. I don't know how I'm supposed to work on CSI if they keep using it. I'm so incredibly hungry I think I'm going to explode.  Stuff sucks. I hate it all. I feel Dave is mad at me for some odd reason. I wouldn't blame him. I'm a mean person like that. I want to crawl into my hole, but someone filled it in with cement. I should kill whoever it was. Yarr.   Current Mood:  Angry
