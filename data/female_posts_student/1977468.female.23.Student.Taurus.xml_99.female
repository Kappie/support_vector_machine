Besides having a grade-school vocabulary ("Yeah, the insurance company won't pay for your rental, they're being all mean to you") and excusing their idiotic behavior with 'the system' ("Oh, because Mercury won't pay for it, we had to take it out of your credit card") they are also complete incompetent #@*****!!! and I hate them. THEY TOOK 400 DOLLARS OUT OF MY BANK ACCOUNT without my knowledge so I overdrew and my credit's maxed out and I've been bombarded by 100 dollars of overdraw fees and had to cut up my cards and reset my accounts.  ...   No phone call, no nothing, and now no money. Not even spare change. And Mercury still refuses to answer their phone or return my calls.  I give up. I'm defeated. The system has sucked all the life out of me. There is no one good, not even one. "Breanna," says Dad. "You can't count on anyone to take care of you. They're like little machines in some room somewhere just working the system." Thanks Dad. Yes, no one cares about me or my life. I thought my life was important but it took this accident to make me realize I'm just some insignificant name in a database of thousands of unfortunate souls.
