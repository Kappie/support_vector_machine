I'm scared to go to Iriga now... I dunno. Maybe I'm in denial or something.. Even my father pointed out that in a span of roughly four years, we've lost many of those close to us. Chiara, Eddie boy, Cheif, Indy, Uncle Sonny, Lolo Ernie, Lolo Judge and now Auntie Jing-jing. It's like some sick coincidence. Even freakier, at around 11:30 last night, something  'flashed'  in my eyes. I was freaked out to find out she died early this morning...    I'm not sure what I'm going to do when I het to Iriga. I'm probably going to become moral support.. I hope I can handle it this time.
