(When I did this I was talking to a woman teacher. After she told me the name of the store, I said Excellent. But that gives a clue to what you're about to say next) Next, ask to try on their shoes. Observe their face.  IF you're playing a basketball/ any sport game and let's just say things aren't going as good as planned and you want to have some fun : 1) bark like a dog 2) roar like a lion. *part 1, the roaring like a dog was inspired by an episode of "america's funniest home videos..*  Make sure you bring a pack of gum with you the next time you go out with your friends. Hopefully, at least one of your friends will ask for a piece. Take out a notebook and write their name. Check your watch. Write down the time. Look at your friend and say: If I don't get the same kind of gum tomorrow, I'm never going to give you gum again. And I'm not going to be your friend. *credit for this one goes to our best friend. she came up with the idea, and we modified it.*  When you're at a mall go to the kids/ toddlers side. Choose a very small shirt. IF a sales person comes and tries to help you tell him/ her that you lost weight and were wondering if they had a smaller size.   oh here's another school one. when the teacher tells you they want your undivided attention or some cra* like that, stare at them without moving one muscle. STARE with all your heart. open your eyes as wide as you can. push your head forward, and place your hands cupped around your ears (as if you want to see and hear everything) then, as they get up to go on the board follow their every movement...that is, if they are writing something on the board move your head along with them. if they move their hand to touch their face or something, copy their movements.  I haven't tried this one out...maybe later. Go to the public library. Take a very tragic book. Sit down and laugh as hard as you can. Slap your knees. Look around and point to the book with a smile. (Romeo and Juliet is a good one)  Next time you're in a restaurant...go up to a complete stranger and look at them hurt. Say in a whiney voice: You ordered with out me?!  When you enter school, wave...the KING WAVE! SMile a fake smile, and say "Autographs will be given at lunch. A nominal fee of 40 bucks will be required." (You know I kinda did this one. I stood up in our balcony in Egypt and began telling everybody standing outside "My people, bow to me..you have...." everybody thought I was a freak.)  When you get a new teacher this is how to be annoying. whenever they do something on the board, for example a problem in math, raise your hand and say, "that's not the way, our teacher used to do it." etc. it really bugs them. *friend said this one before*  things to when you get a propsal for marriage:  I alaways thought that if a guy proposed to me (and I did love him)I'd look at him and say "OMG! You've confused my intentions by a lot. I don't understand why you want to ruin our friendship. Please go...you've done enough." Of course, I probably won't be able to do that becuase if somebody proposed to me who I really loved I'd probably be crying.   I also thought I'd make him answer about 100 questions that are completely irrelevant. Like "When you brush your teeth, which tooth do you start with?" or "When you eat, do you eat from the left side of the plate or the right side of the plate?" or "Which colors look better together :purple and blue or orange and yellow?" When he's finished and I'm grading his answers I'll flinch and grimace every second. I'll even tear one up and say "I'll pretend I didn't see that one." or I might just start crying and say "Why are you doing this to me? Why?" AT the end, I'll look at him and say you passed. Time for the second level and give him the next batch of 100 questions. of course if he actually really loves me, he'll go through it. HAHA, YEAH RIGHT!  things to do in a cinema:  okay, go to a movie you've already gone to. Sit next to a stranger and tell them what's going to happen the whole time. Especially if its a horror movie. For example: somebody is right about to be killed. You say :Don't worry. He's not actually going to die. Just you wait and see. *this was actually done to a frined*  Also, laugh very loudly when its a tragic movie or pretend to cry when its a comedy. Scream peircing screams when anything remotely scary happens. IF somebody is about to kiss, look at whoever sitting next to you and say: Cover your eyes. It's inappropriate while you take out a magnifying glass.   Answer a mobile/ cell phone. Make sure your voice is very loud as you say : NO! You're not disturbing me. I'm just watching a boring movie. It's really not interesting." Keep talking as loud as you can about nothing.  Make lots of crunching noises as you chew pop corn. Eat it like a pig. Stuff your head inside of the box...if somebody asks what you are doing. Say: It takes too much time to put my hand in the box and then bring it back to my mouth. Or say: I'm hungry, Mama. I'm hungry.  When a bad or evil character says their plan say :Boo!! Get off the stage. act like you take the movie personally and start saying mama jokes.  Keep on criticizing everything in the move: costumes, acting, everything. After a very touching scene, snicker and say: I could do tht in my sleep. What a sucky actress!  *My bro did this one. We were watching Around the World in 80 days with Jackie Chan so he got up and tried to mimick all the karate moves. Very EMBARRASSING but funny!*  don't worry. once we think of more, we'll add them!  From the creators of "Str8 from the Asylum" comes  "a list of crazy things to do."  Now in theatres. (hahaha doesn't it kinda sound real?!)  catch yall l8er!
