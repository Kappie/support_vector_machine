(composed by me ok)          Have I ever wondered which hurts the most?  Saying something and wishing I hadn't?  or  Saying nothing and wishing I had?   I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say.   Don't be afraid to tell someone I love them. If I do, they might  break my heart...if I don't, I might break theirs.    Have I ever decided not to become a couple because I was so afraid of losing what I already had with that person?   My heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't.   I can't tell my heart what to do.   It does it on its own.... when I least suspect it, or even when I  don't want it to.   Have I ever wanted to love someone with everything I had, but that other person was too afraid to let me?   Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.   Have I ever denied my feelings for someone because my fear of rejection was too hard to handle?   We tell lies when we are afraid...   afraid of what we don't know,   afraid of what others will think,  afraid of what will be found out about us.   But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.   Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.   Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could have had.   *What would I do if every time I fell in love I had to say  good-bye?    *What would I do if every time I wanted someone they would never be there?      *What would I do if my best friend died tomorrow and I  never got to tell them how I felt?  (even if it is that I don't care anymore)      *What would I do if I loved someone  more than ever and I couldn't have them?
