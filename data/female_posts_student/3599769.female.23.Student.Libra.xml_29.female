Considering that my funds are down to zero, I spent my last dinero on ciggys. And a beer. I swear, I'm no better than the whino out on the corner.   I'm trying to feel better, but at this rate it may take a couple of years. If Timmy is God, then Timmy hear my prayers and get your ass into gear! I've been waiting for a non-conventional miracle, and believe me buddy I'm due.
