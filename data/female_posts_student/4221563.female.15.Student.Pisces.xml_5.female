I have very little work to do, but I feel like I'm a lazy shit who does bugger-all. Maths is horrible- I attempted to finish 10P today, but no luck. It just doesn't stick.  My yo-yo's stuffed. Someone knotted it at the axle so it doesn't spin properly. I'm sad. I'll have to buy another one. That was about the most exciting thing about school today- my yo-yo. I still felt sick, and kind of drowsy with the medication mum fed me. We watched Twelve Angry Men in English- the new version totally wrecked the best scene, and the Eighth juror is old. Really old. And I can't get the whole 'Grumpy Old Men' thing out of my head.  I came home from school dead tired and fell asleep. I had this really weird nightmare, someone was trying to eat me, except I couldn't see who, and I was running, but I wasn't moving. The usual stuff, except I was wearing a gorilla suit. Explain that, quacks!  Seeing as I have nothing else of importance to say, I may as well be on my way.  It's Evolution Baby...
