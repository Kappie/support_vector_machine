They sound a little like Radiohead but mixed in with the  Vines.I would say they are the vines on crack, but in all fairness, the vines probably are on crack, I mean have you seen Craig Nichols? Anyways back to the grocery shopping, have you ever noticed how it can make you hungry like hell? Well it can and it does, cuz now I can not wait for dinner to come. Tomorow is Evas dance recital with Taryn, so I have to go to the early church, which means I can not go out tonight! Bah that maked me MAD! I am not one to hold grudges, so I will get over it relativly soon. Today I was sitting on my deck reading a book that made me laugh quite hard. Its Brittish which just makes it better. I am in the mood for a really sad movie. I really want to see the notebook, friends of mine who have seen it already (because it only came out yesterday you see)have been giving it the thumbs up. I also need to go see Harry Potter, I mean that has taken me FOREVER!!! I can not wait for Evas cottage total days to go:15. Monday I think that the park society that consists of Eva Robert Justin and myself will have a picnic to say buhbye to the female members seeing as it will be difficult for us to have a meeting for a little while with vacationing and all. Today I watched the NHL entry draft. Hockey players are hot.Which brings me to my first blog poll. Who is the hotter set of athletes? Hockey players, or soccer players? I mean both are hot but who reighns supreme? Well we will decide this in the weeks and month to come I think but now I must be off, my hunger has become over whelming!Hoccha Author:Eve
