And throughout this whole duration, stupid Akm disappeared! Heck, I only saw him when we went to get some pizza, me and Minglyanna! Hehe... Hui Shin and Fion were up in the netball court still decorating... Sorry! , gurls! But at lest there  was  a slice of pizza for them upstairs... >. can't  stand it~!!! Anyway, today's quite fun overall, we left Jordan by himself in the stall... Hehe, sorry man!  Ast
