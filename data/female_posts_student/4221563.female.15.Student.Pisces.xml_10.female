We sit around, usually near a peice of overpriced technology, and while away the hours doing geeknerdish things like cross-stitching or playing tetris.        For me, Saturday nights usually mean strange conversations with Lauren via MSN, the odd attempt at writing the Great American Novel (take note; Hemingway), packet stirfry and Law and Order repeats on Pay TV (god wouldn't have invented reruns if he didn't like cable). I think the Willowbark was off.  Right now- it's almost six, (m)(f)(br)- ajah are having a family orientated conversation about Majah's impending re-entrance into the workforce (She recieved a 'top-secret tip off' she got the job at 0900 hours), and I'm sitting here waxing lyrical about my lack of a social life.  Last Night: Practised my Japanese speech until Dylan told me to 'shut up with the gibberish' , and then settled back for a long night in front of the box.  Matchstick Men  was ma-ma (Jap for okay)- nice storyline/characters, but with an extremely dry ending. Went to bed at Eleven (gasp, Lorenzio, at the lateness of the hour!) and saw flowers on the ceiling.  This morning: Watched  Hiroshima,  a three-and-a-half-hour made-for-television-and-'exclusive'-DVD-release spectacle meshing real footage and testimonials with a movie about the lead-up to the atomic splatting on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Spent the next four hours lurking in doorways, convinced someone was going to drop a nuclear weapon on my head.  While I'm talking movies, here's my favourites-of-the-minute-in-no-particular-order: -American Splendour (Docu-drama about Cleveland comic book star Harvey Pekar) -Lost in Translation (Set in Japan, Bill Murray unintentionally becomes my hero) -About a Boy (Just watch it) -Almost Famous (great soundtrack, Patrick-leading-man-can't-remember-last-name is so cute)  Sigh. I have to end this quickly- I've got to accompany Majah to the supermarket on a quest for stirfry vegetables in a packet (what makes them different from normal vegetables? Have they been coached in stirfry ettiquette?). This is phase one in my geeknerd night: An hour at Woolworths, perusing the frozen meals section. If I'm lucky, I might by a new pen and a packet of Mr. Glucose's all-natural-but-still-flavourtastic jellybeans. Damn, I'm good.  LORELAI: What do you call a dog with no legs? (silence) LORELAI: You don't--he's not gonna come anyway. -Thanks for that, Lorenzio, it brightened my day.
