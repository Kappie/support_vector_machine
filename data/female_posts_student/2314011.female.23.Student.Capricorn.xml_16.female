Feelings pretty much going in the opposite direction they were when I arrived, and we love that.  Think my productivity has a lot to do with it.  This morning saw work/duties/responsibilities piling up, landing squarely on my shoulders (sob!), and this evening has that load lessened and manageable...KICK ASS!   And the only way to celebrate is to go home and do a little bit more!   ...Might have a little package waiting for me, too...I dunno! Till next time; over and out.
