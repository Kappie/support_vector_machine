Have some new art to put up soon... have to figure out how I can get it so that no one steals it (mean face here).  I have the most beautiful flowers!!! Ross suprised me with Gerbera Daises with a card that said, "Just because it's Tuesday! Love, Ross".  It was by far the highlight of these few weeks!  Thank you Ross!!!! Love you SO MUCH!!!  So just to let you know look out for  BRAND NEW PICTURES In the pictures portion of my site.  Eh, nothing else to say, except, "I am filled with a sick sick creativity". late
