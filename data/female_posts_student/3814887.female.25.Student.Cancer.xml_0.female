I have found myself watching 4 episodes of Six Feet Under that I rented from Blockbuster. It is a great show if you haven't seen it. I highly recommend it. Fourth of July was really boring. I spent it with one of my friends. We decided to lay low and cook out at her house. I did get to see the fabulous Boston fireworks though when I was driving on the highway to pick up my boyfriend. At any rate, I'm really sleepy today. My tooth is still aching from the root canal and I had too much to drink on Saturday night and I think my body is still trying to recover. I'm pretty content right now though..even though my boyfriend is snoring.. I think I'm gonna have pizza for dinner..Yum! Ahh.. the randomness of this blog is great. I'm a very random person..in case you couldn't tell...Wll anyway hope everyone had a great 4th and will continue to have a great week... ~Bonnie
