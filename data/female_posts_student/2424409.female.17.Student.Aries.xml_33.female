I have other crushes I could go after...but...never mind  School is ok right now, exams are 7 days away...ahhhhh it sux, i hate exams, and my dad's comming weekend is gonna screw everything up, he decided he wanted us for fathers day, so we have to go see him, but i'll write more later, possibly in my other blog or sumthing....  gotta jet ttyl            Lil' Nicki
