It's Thanksgiving break, a Saturday night, and I have no consolation but to know that SNL starts in about ten minutes or so. It's also that time of year again when the Christmas music starts playing, the icicle lights are up and families are hauling trees home. And somehow I just feel like I'm so out of it.  Remind me never to have four days of freedom with just about nothing planned, eh? Life without a schedule, as hated as it is, can be hell.   Life as it is now: there's mink dittos scattered all around my desk, and I still haven't memorized digastric and masseter, much less the rest of the 30-odd mink muscles to go.   Mrs. Battaglia thinks that the people who keep journals could be serial killers. I beg to differ. I don't even know where this strange desire to meticulously record thoughts and actions comes from. Maybe it's from boredom, or just a plain lack of SOMETHING TO DO. Yeah, maybe that's it.  I think I have a piano recital in a week and I'm dreading it. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against piano but practicing and anticipating drives me nuts.  Oh, don't worry about it. I am very strange when I am candid.
