We were buying something, and this guy tried to get in our line, and my mom shouts at him: "Hey the line is behind here, buddy!" SEE, THAT'S WHERE I GET MY RUDENESS FROM-my mom! We're both the same. Then on our way home, "Hey Ya" comes on the radio, and out of the corner of my eye, I can see my mom shimmying to herself. It was great! I have to babysit tonight, NOOO I'm really tired!!! And when am I going to study for exams? PSSH, I DON'T KNOW!
