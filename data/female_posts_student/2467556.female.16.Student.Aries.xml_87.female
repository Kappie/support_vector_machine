Because if not, its a zero that i have to work extra hard to fix my grade for.  I mean, i still have the rest of the tri, but still.....i don't want it to screw over my grade!  The first test is tomorrow and i'm pretty sure i'll do well on it.  The material is pretty easy and i did the review, i feel pretty confident in it.  oh yeah i got an message on dixon's message board from Farhan.....he says there's probably no way i can turn it in now and that i'm screwed.  Gee thanks Farhan, lol.  He's not even in my class though, so i'm still going to attempt to turn it in.  And if Mr. Dixon says its still a zero, then its my fault and i'll just have to make sure in the future that i remember to turn stuff in.  Besides, its only one daily grade out of all the other 100s i've gotten and will get.    Sports Update: yeah so Dallas lost 4-0 to the crappiest team in the entire NHL with a whopping 35 points (which is approx. 17 wins and 1 tie), the Pittsburgh Penguins.  It was sad.  I mean seriously, it takes an effort to lose to Pittsburgh.  Did anyone see the replay of that Todd Bertuzzi of Vancouver hit to Steven Moore of Colorado?!?!  It broke Moore's neck!!!  It was so deliberate and Bertuzzi should be suspended for the rest of the season.  I heard on the national news (surprising that it even made national news) that they're taking it to criminal court and he might be charged with assault and battery!  I hope he is, i never really liked him anyways.  The entire scrap was entirely uncalled for because Moore wasn't doing anything!  oh yeah, Coppell plays Jesuit at 9:30pm.........we're going to be down 7 players.  i'm scared already.  I don't know if we're going to win.  Honestly, if we win, it'll be a miracle.  I just hope that if we lose it won't be that bad.    please please please let the cowboys win tomorrow!!  *prays*, ~~~Taylor~~~
