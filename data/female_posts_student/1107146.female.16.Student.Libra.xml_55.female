For the first seven months of his life, he lived in the woods and under my aunt's bed, and would never get comfortable here, so...  Getting a kitten instead, in about two weeks.  SOB. He was great, I opened his lil' cage and moved his blanket, he BUSTED out of the cage and DESTROYED the room. It was SO AWESOME. I LOVE that cat. But he's GONE. FUCK.  Well maybe the cat shall be just as crazy.  I hope.
