I was sposed to go there early, right??  Well, the guy didn't even get there until 7, so it was pointless =P  Guess what, tho?  Lynn works there, so it's good, cuz at least I know someone!  I'm so glad it's the weekend... cuz I don't think I could stand doing that again.  Then agian, it was only my first day.. so, I guess I'll get used to it.  But, if it gets to be too much, then I might just quit and go do something else instead.  *sigh*... work, is a lot of work... =P
