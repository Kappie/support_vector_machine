Because I woke up from one of the best dreams, even though I can vaguely recall everything, I remember the general idea and of course who was in the dream...Too bad I have this weird cold, stuffed up nose thing so I couldn't go back to sleep. But now all that is going to be on my mind today, trying to remember how I felt as compared to now and just wanting to go back to sleep to recapture it. Everything was so wonderful, so perfect...Then my phone got a text message and woke me up, argh. I had to get up sooner or later though, it was after 10:30. That's it my phone's going to be on quiet :/   I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like Do you know what it feels like? Cause with you I can let my hair down  I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you
