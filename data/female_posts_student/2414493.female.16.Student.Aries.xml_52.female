Journalism's done, and I'm really happy at how the front page turned out even if the other news pages are a bit dull. I like it--maybe it's a little more interesting than the static two-story format, but the continued's were annoying. Mock trial won't happen again until the end of this week, which is so completely ok with me. We need some sort of spark, some sort of spirit...blast it, I'm going both days, even if it's only work with the witnesses.  So tonight it's the rest of Bailey and a style analysis essay and that portfolio chart. Not that all assignments weren't given to me two weeks ago, but...  This is one of the happiest times this entire school year despite too many things to do and a general aching fatigue. I still can't believe that it's all mine, though. And people come up to me and ask if it's true, and sometimes I start to wonder, is it? Is it so out of the ordinary that it invites such questions?   More later...K's online! haha
