Well, one day at school, the work started to pill up, and they all know how to do it al, it would just take along time. So   Noah came up with this great idea, what if we help eachother out so we can have time to e-mail our mohters and tell them what great people they are!! Nina and Elana were scared at first, but they all agreed to do the wrk at the best of their abilty and HELP eachother out. Well, one day there teacher Mr. Moody saw these three intelligente kids   helping eachother, he took them one at a time into a secluded room, and told them that ther actions to help eachother was wrong and unfair!!! Each one of them honestly explained to the nice principal that their actions were on the right place, that they were helping eachother out so they had time to write nice e-mails   to their mothers thanking them for everythig that they do. Well the prinicpal understood and sent them back to class. The kids were awarded with an award of honesty at the end of the day by the ukiah unified school district. When they all got home they explained to their parents that tere actions were awarded and honored. This story is a tale of three friends that just wanted to help eachother and have time to thank their mothers, and in the end, they came out on top.
