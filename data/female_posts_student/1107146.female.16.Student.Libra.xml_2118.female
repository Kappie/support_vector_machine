Sounds more like psychodynamic tho, and the things really didn't do anything besides tear shit up...then again, what else are they supposed to represent? Oh, I know, having sex with your mother and killing your father, because after all, that's all it boils down to anyway. There, the Freudian/Jungian analysis is complete.  I bet Freud got really tickled every time he used the word " anal ytical".
