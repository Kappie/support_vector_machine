     
      I'm selling my car. I've decided to get fit, to start saving money for a trip to tanzania next summer and to aid the environment (and my finances!)  Sorry for a SEVERE lack of bloggage recently.  Please accept my humble and feet licking apologies.  Have been away on SU camp and tons of other things. Am home currently but going up to Edinburgh on Saturday for a few days  vacation . Then I'm back to brum for a church kids thing and then off to Greenbelt, which is the coolest thing ever. then its Rachel's wedding and then back to Brum for some work and money earning before term starts. aahhh exhausted already.
