First, we came out ( i came with him...from the airport...from florida...grandfather is not looking so hot, but that's abother story) and we shopped out way out, and saw the big duck...I'll post a picture when he e-mails them. Then we hung out, and had dinner in Sag Harbor, and went to this party kind of by North Haven/Sag Harbor...it was so utterly random. We pull up, I knew one kid, Ian knew zero, and within 15 minutes we're playing enver have I ever and beer pong while Schuyler's mom hands out Coronas and suddenly this cop comes and everyone kinda moves away from teh beer and the cop's like, "hey Kids!" and it's like Schuyler's fam friend or aomething and anyway it was just WEIRD. But hysterical.    So that was friday. Saturday, Ian and my dad went and played tennis for like, 5 hours. I was bored but male bonding...cute. The weather was shit-ttyyy but we beached it anyway, just kinda looked at the clouds rolling over the ocean...his third time in the Atlantic ocean ever...hehe. Dinner at our friend's house, and then...then...we went back to the beach at dark...and...let's just say that that drink 'sex on the beach' better be amazing because its namesake...wow. Yeah.    Moving on to Sunday, we went to town, ran around, did some other boring shit, visited my restaurant and got lunch for the three of us, then like midday my mom finally came home (she was catering a party in jerz) oh and i forgot to mentiojn the whole weekend we ate tons of bread. Ian's mom baked us like 3 loaves of challah and foccacia and biscotti and all this other amazingh shit. So she came home, and we were still bored but the weather was a little nicer, so we drove to another beach, and suddenly it was so gorgeous! but we had no towels and we were fully dressed and shit. So all of a sudden (the beach only had a few people on it...) I'm like, "Fuck it" and i tossed all my clothes on the sand and jumped in! It was freezing, adn that was sooo un-sami. He did it too and we had a blast. But i Might have pnemonia.So then we came home showered and got all dressed up (haha) and went out to dinner with Molly and Elliot, her boyfriend, who are both really cool, and we got this big sushi boat and it was a blast. Then we went back to Elliot's. Elliot has a pool house. 'nuff said.    He had to leave Monday, like 2 ish,. it was tres sad.Whatever, it was an amazing weekend. He should live here more often. I am so freaking tired it' not even funny. So, I went back to work and blah-di-blah blah. I just have to add this story for Margaux's sake. there are these two girls who work in my restaurant at the pizza counter...little loacls, spanish girls, like 14 and 15 years old. So alst night they're running all around and whispering and making a big deal out of something, and I find out that they have just purchased their first pot froim the chef, Julio. (He's nuts.) One of them got like $15 worth adn teh other got $20. Anywway they're flipping out from nerves/excitement blah blah blah. The most hysterical part is, theyhave no idea how to smoke it. Whatsoever. They're running around asking people to roll it for them! So they beg me to help them, and as much as you guys know I won't touch the shit, I've lived with margaux long enough to know how to be resourceful. I asked them to get me an orange, apple, inhaler, water bottle, starbuck's gum tin...(kidding) but they're like, 'Whoa! You can do all that! Shit muthafucka!!!" They're really local. and young. it's hysterical. So at one point one of them runs up to me with a sheet of that waxy paper tehy uise in pizza boxes, to absorb oil,a nd she's like, can we use this?! I look her straight in the eye, like, "Tanya. This paper, when burned, will emit toxic fumes. Seeing as I do not like working inthe front of the restaurant, I Dont' really want you to DIE before tomorrow!" Finally out of the goodness of my heart I drew them a margaux-esque diagram aof the water bottle contraption. good thing you trained me right, Marg. God, that was an escapade.   I guess nothing that new to report ova hya...I just miss home, and I've been thinking a lot about school and stuff. JEsus...seniors?! And my mom had a breakdown as that this was my last year really living at home. Am I supposed to be doing FOCUS work? College essays?! WHY DONT THEY GIVE US INSTRUCTION?! Somebody write back or something.
