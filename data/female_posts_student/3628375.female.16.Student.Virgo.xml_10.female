He said he learned alot and realized how dangerous things were, and he's done smoking until he's off probation and that won't be until next summer. I am just so damn glad he's back. I've missed him like crazy. We hung out today but we were bored and were going to go to the trailer park but my parents wouldnt let me go, so heleft at 6:00 to go see Matt and Janet. I told him to call me when he gets home. I'm going over to Janet's tomorrow around noon or so, when she gets home from church. And John's supposed to go over there sometime. I'm just so happy! I can't even explain it. G2G!!~ Love ~*CaSeY*~      ***Happiness comes to those who wait***
