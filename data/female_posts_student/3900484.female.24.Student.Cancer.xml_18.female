They just got a new male in, and they want to make sure he gets along ok with the girls before putting them on exhibit. Im excited...this is more along the lines of stuff I want to do after I finally get done with school (in the next 6-7 years). Yay for orangs.   Boys are making me angry. Very very angry. I keep getting these stupid crushes on them that last for about a week because then they piss me off by not responding to me. "I NEED SOME HELP HERE PEOPLE!". Honestly. And it's not like im butt ugly or anything. I had real hopes for tattoo boy. They are dwindling as time passes.   I had visions of us living together, and him scaring away my family. That would be awesome. I need someone who could do that more often. I think he could thrive in conditions like that. But, ok... I moved a little ahead of myself on that one. At least hes not like Tim, whom I had visions of us living together and running every morning and getting married and living happily ever after.   Maybe this is a psychosis. For some reason I picture me and "boy" (whomever my current crush may be) inthe future, before even having one date. It's been something like a year since Ive been on a date, speaking of that. Do you forget what to do? Im scared that if I go on one Im going to be too intense and scare the person off. I think i allready do that with my visions of marriage. Heck, I don't even want to get married and im envisioning marrying these people. Weird.   I smell. I need a shower.
