For just $10, I was treated to a buffet spread though Ifeasted mainly on the  spaghetti and  desert. The theme for this year is 'Climbing Mount Adversity' so basically the committee decorated the place to look like Base Camp; even the temperature was freezing. We were among the first to reach so I had to wait for quite a while before dinner was served. In the meantime I was entertained by a group doing forfeit with their butts. After eating our fill, there was the skit and video introducing the newly launched   urlLink  ASCO   (Adventist Students Care Organisation,founded by Uncle T.C.)website and it's functions. It helps students to search for tertiary institutions of higher learning. I was supposed to be acting as the innocent victim who got mugged but I asked Wanda to fill in for me. I hope I didn't disappoint Nathaniel because I backed outin the last minute. We all received a very stylish metallic pen as a door gift. It has four different ink types: black, red, a 0.5 mechanical pencil and a white tip (which I have yet to discover its purpose). To choose the ink-type you just have to look at the word printed on the side of the pen and click the top. No fussing, no turning. Just look, and press. How cool is that? I don't know how it works but it sure saves a lot of hassle. Uncle T.C. also graciously gave me his 'dog tag' with the words 'ASF Day 2004. We Stand Alone Together' inscribed on it (only committee members have it); justlike the kind you wear in the army so that they'llknow what to carve on your tombstoneif you happen to die in battle. Louis ended up having to get his from Pastor because I took Uncle T.C.'s.   The trip home was a hilarious one, I laughed 'til my side muscles ached. Wayne and Louis were fooling around as usual.But Wanda looked so beat since she was out the whole day.We were sharing lame jokes and riddles from the MRT to the bus stop. I got toknow a new friend too. I've seen Amos in our church many times but didn't really talk to him.Now I'm looking forward to more of his lameness this Saturday, though I think the bus ride home together with Louis and Barbara kinda scared him off a little. (Sean got off at Clementi, while Wayne and Wanda alighted at Chinese Garden for their mum tofetch them.)He says he'll need to bring two jackets to church in future. One to keep him warm from the air-conditioner in the sanctuary and the other to guard against my 'leng' jokes.
