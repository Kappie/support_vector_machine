You did everything for me and I threw it all away. I hate myself for this. I hate myself for making you believe in me then fucking it all up. You were the only one who ever believed me or cared about me at all. I hate myself for letting this fall apart. I hate myself for every stupid thing I did and every mistake I made that led to this. And I know nothing I can say will ever change your mind. And its not ok, its not ok at all. But the only thing I can do is let you know how sorry I am, whether or not you believe me. I just needed you to know. There's nothing else I can do.   I know you're ok, I know you'll be happy, but I'm not you, and I'm not happy. I won't be ok at all after this.
