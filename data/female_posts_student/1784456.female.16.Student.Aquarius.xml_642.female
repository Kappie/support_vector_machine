Oh well *sigh* my mum just came back from a actual wedding, I'm going to the do's later. She wore this hat, and she wrapped a green scarf around it just so she could take her green furry hand bag! Which kind of looks like a green cat if you squint! Mmm, so any way, sorry I'm shopping on amazon again. I'm kind of addicted to it! Oh, you mean a link to downloading ricochet or whatever? Stupid girl, go get it off kazaa.
