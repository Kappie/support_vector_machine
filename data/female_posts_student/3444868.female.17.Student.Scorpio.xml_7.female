I went to see Shrek 2 today.  Very good movie.  Although I did not like the plug for Justin Timberlake on there.  That's just wrong.  I'm having a tough time deciding if I like the first movie or the sequel more.  They're both good, but I think I'm gonna say I like the original.  Originals are always better (with a few exceptions).  I also saw Mean Girls recently.  It was ok.  I've seen better, but a lot of it was true.  One day I'm gonna write a script.  I've already started on one actually.  It doesn't have a title yet, but it's a parody on romantic comedies.  If any of this sounds familiar it's because my friend Veronica and I are working on it together.  She's already posted our favorite lines from it.  We'll be famous one day.  Maybe not for this script, but we'll be famous and loved by all.  I'm about to break into song.  Just a little hint, cover your ears.  This is all Veronica's fault.  She made me this cd (i'm still waiting on another one that I will get one day.  Won't I Veronica!!!!=) Mrs. Gilstrap smiley!!!)  So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night I hate to go and leave this pretty sight
