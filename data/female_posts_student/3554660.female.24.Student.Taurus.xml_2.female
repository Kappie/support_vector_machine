One of my friends once asked me, "Why are you so scared of everything?" I honestly don't know why I fear so many things. Some of the things that I do fear there isn't a reson to fear them at all. Seriously who is scared of the dark? Little children and me I can't even say why I am scared I just have this overwhelming discomfort in complete darkness. The same thing happens when it storms outside. I know that I am not scared of God, or am I?     God has given us many promises. Promises that I look forward to seeing. Some I have already seen. So I ask myself do I fear the lord? Yes, I am not scared of him. I am not scared that he will turn his back on me when I need him. I know that he has a great plan and I am to trust him with all of my heart and I do. So how do I fear the lord? I fear that I will displease him. I may not ask for forgiveness. I may think that my sin is little, when really all sins are equal. I fear that I may shame my father for it is a Father's love that I look for in God and recieve it. I fear that my mistakes in my mind will be great even though I know that his son Jesus Christ has died to take them away from me. As I live my life I keep the fear of the lord in my mind so I may not make as many mistakes. God loves us unconditionally, we can show him the same kind of love by living for him by fearing him.  Psalms 103:13 As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
