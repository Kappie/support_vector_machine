I was really pissed because I thought I'd have an amazing night of sleep just because of everything that happened yesterday but it was a damned restless night. I could hardly fall asleep and I kept waking up or just become really hot or uncomfortable. But I went to bed at 3:30am and got up before 11.  That has never happened before.  Well, it probably has but the point of this is I  voluntarily got up at before 11  and I don't think that has happened recently. So I ate, got ready, and just sat online because I didn't feel like doing anything else. Then I went to my Grandpa's.I was going crazy because I couldn't find his newspaper or his watch and he wanted them both! And I looked all over the freaking house! Everywhere! Eventually, we found the newspaper hidden between old newspapers and the watch was stuck in his bed sheets. So that was a relief. After that, Eddie, my mom, and me went to the Richmond mall. Eddie got  *CUTE*  clothes for once! I'm happy with him! And I ended up getting shorts and a tank top. I almost got this really cute black skirt but,  no surprise , my mom thought it was too short. And it wasn't even short!  But my mom didn't see me trywhat I goton and she always likes to see it so she knows if I look like a hoe or not. So when we got home, she said, "Uh, those both look a little small.  If you look like a whore with them on, you're not leaving the house! " So I tried them both on and my mom was like, "Okay!" See? I'm a good girl.  At times.  (wink!) So then I came home. Cleaned, did crunches, read Chapter 10 of LOTF!  Only two more fucking chapters and I'm done with that bitch!  But then I have Tom Sawyer...uh! So I ate and got ready for soccer. Uh, soccer. Enough said!  Well, let's just say, I'm damn proud of myself because of soccer!  We did our warm up mile, no surprise, Nicole and I were in the back! But it was so amazing, Nicole just kept saying she refused to walk and  she kept giving me the strength to keep running and not walk.  So we finished and Coach Gamire mumbled, "Under 7, good job!" to the whole team. And I'm like WTF?! "What was Nicole and my time?" "Under 7 minutes." First off, I've  never  ran a whole mile without walking. So that in itself is an accomplishment. And then, I've  never  ran a mile in 6 minutes and how ever many seconds!  And now I did!   I was soo happy about that!  But later we did some crazy ass sprints and I had the worst asthma attack  I've ever had.  I was just wheezing so much and my breathing was so heavy and my chest was soo tight. I thought I was gonna pass out. But I kept going and I finished. And for the cool down mile, I didn't walk any. Wow! And even if Nicole and I came in last, we gave it our best, we didn't walk, and we finished. I say that's good enough. And if someone disagrees,  FUCK YOU!  I'm getting good. And it's only the secondday of practice.  I better be hot by the end of this season  with all the hard work I'm putting in. But I'm gonna hurt like a mother fucker tomorrow. Today I was hardly sore. But we did double the amount of lundges and even more running and I'm already hurting so I can't wait til tomorrow! I came home and just like fell on my bed.  It's neverfelt that good before. And then I watched America's Next Top Model. I was totally surprised the one girl won. I wanted her to win but the other girl she was against was like Miss All American. But I'm glad she didn't. And now I'm here.
