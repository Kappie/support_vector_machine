Laura's house. *sigh* Oh well. I had to cause my brother had a massive party! I just got back (It's 3:30) and there were beer cans everywhere! *shock* And a half empty bottle of scottish whisky *so shoot me, I can't spell!* I went shopping after I went to Laura's. Oh, yeah we made Izzy a present! Let's just say that it would match the colour of this web page *hehe* Hey has any one else heard Queens of the Stone Age? I've got them going through my head! (Along with other things) I'm not alone any more! (Whatever that means) Ahh... I gotta go for birthday cake! I'll blog some sense later! Bisibi!
