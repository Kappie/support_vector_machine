Then again, I don't exactly want to provoke Rosie's wrath, so just do me a favor and don't get in a fight, because everyone knows that it's my job to mediate, and I'm not in a mediating mood.  My last mediation went to the dogs (Megan, Logan, Tisa, Katie, etc.) and I'm not up for it yet.  And if you absolutely have to fight, at least wait until I get back.  Or until school starts, that would be even better.  Just wait and blow up the first day of school.  That would really be the most convenient for the rest of us.
