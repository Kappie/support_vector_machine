In form this morning, everyone was sitting around in a circle, and I tried to join in, but noone would talk to me or anything. I felt so bad ... so I ended up going outside and sitting outside my locker eating chocolate - which I really shouldn't have wasted my money on this morning.  I hope my mood improves before the end of the day - I'm seeing Fazz this afternoon, and I need to be happy ... which I am - I'm happy that I get to see him (it's been awhile), but I'm still miserable about my situation at school. It's kinda sad that the only classes I actually have *friends* in, are maths, French and elective music.  Speaking of French, I have a vocab test next !!! I haven't studied either, really. I don't think I'll do too badly - because I understand most of the words. The main ones I'm gonna have trouble with are  un film de guerre  (a war movie),  un film d’épouvante  (a scary movie),  décevant  (disappointing), and  interdit  (forbidden).  Wish me luck !!!
