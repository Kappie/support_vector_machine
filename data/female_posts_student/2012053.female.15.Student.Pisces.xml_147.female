Maria Sharapova has the game, the presence and the look.   What a final! Forget that Sharapova's only 17; that first set was flawless. We saw flashes of that ability in her quarterfinal with Ai Sugiyama and semifinal against Lindsay Davenport. But to come out that way against Serena Williams -- fighting from the first ball hit -- proved Sharapova's mindset. Then to win the first set 6-1, doing that to Serena on a grass court, is one of the most impressive finals I've seen.    Everything in Sharapova's game held up well. In the second set, Serena couldn't convert when faced with a couple of chances. She broke Sharapova only to lose on her own serve the next game. Serena couldn't hold onto any momentum. That signaled to Sharapova that this was her chance against Serena. She wasn't the same ruthless Serena she was during her Slam run. Instead, Serena felt the intimidation factor of Sharapova, which you never would have expected to happen this soon. Serena had a near perfect record in major finals with the only blemish her loss to Venus at the 2001 U.S. Open.    As for Sharapova, as she accepted the trophy she indicated that she already sees herself in other major finals and sees herself winning more titles. That's an attitude that has be groomed and is a result of the environment she was brought up in.   Sharapova is still restricted in the number of tournaments she can play because of the WTA's age rule. There's going to be some pressure on the WTA if Sharapova wants to play a full schedule as the Wimbledon winner. When Martina Hingis won at an even younger age, she was not under the constraints of the age restrictions in place now. Of course, she's also retired at age 23.   As for women's tennis, Sharapova's performance brought it back to a level it had lost in the past year. After no excitement at the Australian Open until the final and no matches of interest at the French Open, the semifinals and final at Wimbledon were intriguing.   Perhaps people will be more sympathetic and supportive of the the Williams sisters now that they've shown they are vulnerable to injury and defeat. Neither of them is holding one of the major titles anymore. Despite that, Serena was so gracious in the way she received Sharapova. Smiling genuinely at the joy of a first-time major winner. She allowed Sharapova to shine and indicated she was happy simply to have reached the final after such a long injury recovery.    There's still a big need in women's tennis to get everybody healthy. If somehow both Belgians could return at the U.S. Open to join the Williams sisters, Jennifer Capriati, Davenport (in her last appearance there) and the rising Russian brigade, it would revive the level of the sport.    Coming into this year, who would have guessed that the first three major winners would be Justine Henin-Hardenne, Anastasia Myskina and Maria Sharapova? With the top two seeds in Roger Federer and Andy Roddick reaching the men's final, for the first time in a while men's tennis is more predictable than women's tennis. Despite all the rain delays, this Wimbledon is turning out to be a cool event.     The Associated Press Updated: 5:07 p.m. ET July 03, 2004WIMBLEDON, England - Waiting to walk out on Centre Court with Serena Williams for the Wimbledon final, Maria Sharapova was fidgety. She bit her nails, tapped her foot, pressed a finger against her neck to feel her pulse.   After the match, Sharapova was giddy and giggly, fumbling with a cell phone while trying to call Mom, just like any 17-year-old at a suburban mall on Saturday afternoon.  Ah, but Maria Sharapova is not the average teen. Not by a longshot. And this was no ordinary afternoon.  Taking the next big step in a remarkably quick journey from Siberia to Florida to tennis’ grandest lawn, Sharapova was as confident and cagy as a veteran in her first Grand Slam final. She completely outclassed two-time defending champion Williams 6-1, 6-4 Saturday, becoming the third-youngest winner in Wimbledon’s 127 years.  “I’m absolutely speechless. I never, never in my life expected this to happen so fast,” Sharapova said. “It’s always been my dream to come here and to win. But it was never in my mind that I would do it this year.”  It was the most lopsided Wimbledon women’s final in a dozen years, and there were so many other reasons the result was stunning: Sharapova’s inexperience (just six previous majors), her out-of-nowhere status (at No. 13, she’s the tournament’s lowest-seeded female champion), and her opponent.  Williams was 6-1 in Slam finals and last lost this soundly in March 2000.  And after all those all-Williams and all-Belgian major finals, the last two Grand Slam tournaments were won by Russians. Anastasia Myskina gave the country its first such title at the French Open last month.  Now Williams, whose ranking slides to No. 14, and older sister Venus have yet another young superstar to deal with.  “I’m definitely going to triple my efforts, do everything I can to play better next time,” said Williams, 22, who had been playing her best tennis since missing eight months after left knee surgery last August. “Like I always say, everyone’s a big threat. You just can’t underestimate anyone.”  No one will dare underestimate Sharapova from now on, thanks to her wonderful backhand and serving, her court coverage and, most importantly, her toughness.  “At 17, to have that ability already, it’s pretty amazing,” said Andy Roddick, who won his rain-suspended semifinal and will play defending champion Roger Federer in the men’s final Sunday. “But it’s almost like she expects it. There’s something inside her that’s pretty impressive.”  Still, Sharapova’s unfamiliarity with Saturday’s stage seemed obvious at the start: She cut her warmup short to get permission to leave to go to the bathroom. Once play began, though, it was as clear as the blue sky above that she belonged.  Sharapova opened the match’s fourth game by using all of her 6-foot frame to reach for a backhand to keep the point going, then whipped a forehand winner. She ended that game by striking a backhand return right at the baseline, throwing Williams back on her heels to break for a 3-1 edge.  Sharapova, fighting a cold, broke again to make it 5-1 with a backhand return angled so well Williams didn’t even give chase. Now that’s a rare sight.  In the second set, it was more of the same: Sharapova digging in on key points, and Williams on the defensive. On one 19-stroke exchange, Williams fell while scrambling along the worn baseline. She stayed flat on her back while Sharapova deposited the ball in the open court. In the next game, with Williams at the net, Sharapova whacked a two-fisted backhand right at her. The ball glanced off Williams’ frame, caught her on the nose and trickled into the net.  After, Williams paid perhaps the ultimate compliment, saying: “She’s kind of like me. She doesn’t back off. She keeps giving it her all.”  That helped when Williams broke Sharapova’s serve for the only time to lead 4-2 in the second set. Many players would have folded.  “I was like, ’OK, Maria, get yourself together.’ But I pulled it out,” said Sharapova, who lost the first sets of her quarterfinal and semifinal before rallying.  “I’m just a very tough person when I go on the court.”  She broke right back with a backhand return that caught the baseline, then clenched a fist and glared across the net. That opened a four-game run to close the match, including another break with Williams serving at 4-4. It was a superb game, with both players grunting while trading powerful and precise shots, including Sharapova’s half-volley lob that curled over Williams like a rainbow.  When Williams dumped a forehand into the net to end the match, Sharapova dropped to her knees, bent over and covered her face with her hands. Williams went around the net for a gracious embrace. Sharapova then climbed into the stands to find her father, Yuri, for a hug and kisses.  Back on court for the trophy presentation, Sharapova tried to dial her mother, Yelena, to tell her the great news but couldn’t get through. Mom was on a plane from their home in Bradenton, Fla., to New York and found out while watching in-flight TV.  Imagine the conversation with the person in the next seat:  “Hey! My daughter just won Wimbledon!”  “Yeah, sure, lady.”  Sharapova’s whole story is hard to believe.  Martina Navratilova spotted her wielding a racket at a Moscow tennis exhibition as a kid and encouraged Yuri to get her serious coaching in the United States.  So he took his daughter to Florida when she was 7; her mother couldn’t get a visa and had to stay in Russia for two years. At 9, Sharapova moved into the dorms at Nick Bollettieri’s tennis academy with older girls and had a hard time fitting in.  Look at her now. The talk show circuit awaits, plus sponsorship deals galore. Sharapova already has a modeling deal. She’s dismissed comparisons with Anna Kournikova, and rightly so: Kournikova never won a title of any sort.  Sharapova now has four, including a major.  “I hope it doesn’t change the person who I am right now,” Sharapova said. “I already told a few people, ’If I change, then hit me in the head, please.”’       WOW   ok about me now..it is my blog  haha i went shopping for shorts and a swimsuit  gosh what is this stupid world coming to, they must think that every girl wants to be a prostitute or something, it makes me mad  so i found NOTHING except for a skirt  so NOW we are going to the mall on monday    *gags*
