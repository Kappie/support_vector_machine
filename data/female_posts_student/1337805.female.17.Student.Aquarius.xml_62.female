A few minutes later all the horses in the field beside me ran to the fence. When I got over to where they were looking, I could see that they were looking at the dear - free in the fields, not confined to a fence and able to run free. They got to the corner of the fence, and if they tried hard enough, they might have broken through.   I went rowing with Clare today. Always an adventure with her. I got to sit in the coach boat, and I saw my favourite lake from a brand new perspective. It's quite beautiful, and one day I'd love to rent a kayak and go off exploring. Lots of weeds, but swimming in them wasn't all that bad. Clare and me discovered the clay beds and covered ourselves in it. It was quite gross, but lots of fun. After we ran to the rowing building and had a shower. We cheated:)  I'm quite tired, very hot, and very concerned for my appetite. It's leaving. I can hardly eat anything without getting full. But don't worry, all you people who don't read this, the times I do eat, I try and eat only veggies and protein. I'm barely eating one and a half meals. Not too good.  I want to go back and watch Pirates of the Carribean and Finding Nemo. So far, those are the best movies I have seen this year. I also want to go camping. Really bad. The only thing, is that the camping trip that is confirmed and everything is in September. So far away, and it won't be warm enough to go swimming and push people in. I guess after the sunday youth meeting in Augest we'll have to go off to some lake and go swimming. Durrance is very close to the church. We could go there....  I'm almost regretting youth group on the 15 of August. Sure I love it, and I get to see all my rabid and crazy friends from there, but it's the one place I have to hide what I feel for Tom from everyone else. It was so hard at the last meeting, it's just going to be plain cruel now. But now that my brother knows, there is no guarentee that he will keep his mouth shut. No matter how hard I threaten. Only time will tell, and man..I dunno. It's nice, or was nice, not having our parents know, and even though mine know, it isn't all that bad. But then, not hiding it can't be worse off. I mean....Then we don't have to hide. Like some people in the closet. It's like we're stuck in our own little unique closet....  Sanford, I miss you, and I'll find some suitable pictures and put them in a folder in my Yahoo photos...The addy is at the top, and I'll clearly label them so you'll know. Hope you're having fun in Michigan or whatever.
