The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriets mind was not to be talked away.  He might be superseded by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else she feared, would cure her. Harriet was on of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times ever day Harriet was sure just to meet with him, or just to miss him, just to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjjecture... Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness...  Have you ever been talked into loving someone other than the one you really wanted?   Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love... she was not so easily to be talked out of it.
