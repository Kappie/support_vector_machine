It was quite surprising actually, I don't even know if I did anything right in band for the past four years. Darn, if only it were my 'O' level result slip.    Today was a good, happy and fruitful day because I missed school. Played with the pedal some more in the morning because I've to pass it on to Nicholas tomorrow. I'm going to miss the amount of gain I managed to get out of it this past week although it did eat up a whole 9V battery.  Went down to Isetan with my mum and brother, got ourselves a mogu cushion each (Mine is bright orange! =)) and some new towels. Paid a hefty $36 for the nicely packaged 0.5mm in diameter polystyrene beads, but it's okay because this is more solid and it doesn't go out of shape easily like the cheaper $9.90 ones do. Now I'll have an additional thing to hug when I go to bed. The nice people there gave us a discount for a tower fan to thank us for patronising them and offered to deliver it to us free of charge so we didn't need to lug our shopping bags home. I'm enjoying the cool wind from the fan now, a break from the recent span of hot and humid weather.  Next, to Takashimaya's Sushi Tei for lunch. Saw MediaCorp artiste Cassandra Lee and two other actresses, my mum said she smiled at us but I was too occupied with heap of sushi in front of me  to notice. Then, to the departmental store to get myself some new clothes. (Yes, I finally got down to it.)  No more time for anything else, we caught a train back to Jurong East so I won't be late for cell group. Took the opportunity to go scouting for books at Popular again. Sadly enough, Tuesdays with Morrie was still out of stock so I left for MacDonald's empty handed. Met Shaun and Joel on the way there. Louis and Tricia joined us halfway, Nathaniel and Trudy joined the group at the traffic light, and Barbara, Nicholas and Wei Siang met us in Jurong Entertainment Center itself. It was past 7.30. So much for meeting in church at 7.00pm. This should tell you a lot about the punctuality of Jurong youths. It's an unspoken rule that the meeting times are always stated half an hour earlier than the actual meeting time for reasons we all know why.  We took quite some time settling down and actually getting down to ordering our food. Barbara treated me to popcorn chicken from KFC and I treated her to McFlurry from Macs. All this happened while Sergeoh and James waited alone in church for us to return. Cell was out in the open tonight and without bibles too, we just used the hour to catch up with each other. The breeze was cool; the porch lights were warm and cozy. Everything was perfect until Tricia, Trudy and Barbara all screamed in unison with the appearance of a little brown cat, just when Shaun was at the climax of his horror story. (He was the victim of attempted assault in school this week. He has a psycho maniac for a classmate, who tried back stabbing him, literally, with a penknife. Thank goodness his friends pushed him aside in time, or we'd have to have cell in NUH for the second consecutive week, after Victor's case of food poisoning and infected capillaries.) That has got to be the most frightening 5 seconds of my life, as far as I can recall.  We were too lazy to move after cell ended so we set up a little booth with baskets lined up at one wall, and us, standing at the opposite wall with an entire box of balls, all geared up to shoot. We got bored after a while because none of us managed to score, the balls simply bounced off the wall and we had to pick up the mess. So we decided to aim at Louis instead, after all, there was a larger chance of us actually hitting the target. Sergeoh didn't like the idea of just using one ball at a time, so he simply hurled the entire contents of the box at him. They all missed though, so we had to start picking up the mess again. But well, whoever knew the immense pleasure little inflated plastic coloured spheres could bring us.  Wayne decided sit through the full loop of the 334 bus ride to accompany me after everyone alighted seeing that I was all alone, but I think it's because he's too tired to walk after playing soccer. Haha, nevertheless, it was very nice of him to do so. Because of the delay during dinnertime, cell ended late, explaining why I only got round to blogging about the day's events at this time of the night. Say no more, my new cushion lies invitingly on my bed as I type.  Peace.
