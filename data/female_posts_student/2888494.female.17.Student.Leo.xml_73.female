He's still beautiful and reserved and perfect on the superficial levels. I think he quit, you see, and therefore hasn't been present at work to dominate my thoughts. A shame. Such a beautiful boy. It seems like everybody quit at spag, I feel like a veteran.  What ever did happen to Claudio? I'll keep you updated.
