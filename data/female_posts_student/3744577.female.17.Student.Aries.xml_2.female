I didn't want to make friends because I knew that we were only going to around each other for a short period of time and I hate having to say goodbye. I've had two hard summers of leavig Akbar and the crew in Michigan and Kyle and the boys during AMA. I mean we are still in touch, but I'm just very sad that I can't see my friends all the time.  Well, I think that I've actually made a friend that I could probably stay friends with beyond work. Her name is Courtney and she is really cool. We like all the same music, shows, magazines and we even have the same middle name. She is really cool and we had a lot of fun today and I was really happy to chill with her and she is going to be around since she is a senior like me and is going to keep on working through the school year.  I see Maroon 5 on Friday and I'm so excited about it! I can't wait! I love their CD and know the words to all the songs and I'm jsut stocked about the whole thing! Courtney is going to the concer too, another thing we have in common.
