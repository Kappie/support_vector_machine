My dad had heart surgery in early June and he's feeling better now, but still struggling because he's not as strong as he use to be. Poor dad. Anyway, he's still alive. That's the important thing. I don't know if he will be able to work again, but he still plans to build another harp or two! :)  Rose Hill   The Sounds of Summer  The singing of the cicadas In my backyard…  The chirping crickets In my grass….  The ribbits of the frogs In my pond…  The barking of the dogs Near my house…  The fighting squirrels On the lawn…  The cats meowing By my side….  The robin’s rounds In the tree…  The silent sounds Of summer too…  The days are here Of summer…  Go enjoy… A singing or silent  Moment or two!  By Rose Hill 6-6-04  Waiting for dad… Waiting in a hospital Waiting for some news..  My father is in the surgery Drugs take over his body…  Mom is worried sick… I try not to be.  Waiting for some news.  Will he pull through? Will he recover? Will he be able to Do the things he use To do?  Will he be able to Work the crossword Puzzle?  And will he be able To make things Like harps  With singing strings?  I hope so. I love my dad.  He’s gotta pull through And fight the good fight. Until his time on earth Is ended.
