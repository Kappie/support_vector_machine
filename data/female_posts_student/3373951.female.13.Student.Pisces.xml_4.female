It was SO boring!!! The most fun thing we did was to swim in the salty sea, where my lil bro lost his goggles haha. We were wrestling for the inflatable ball we'd brought along and everyone was watching. Sheesh...haven't they seen two siblings fight before??? Heck, don't they even know that if two siblings fight it means that they care for each other a lot??? *Mutters*   Sorry I'm being such a grump. I just feel like being a grump even though I'm not really in a bad mood or whatever...guess it's just a mood swing. Ah, the pros and cons of being a teenager. *Sigh*  Aniwaez, while I was swimming, I was being very childish and babyish. I don't knwo why. It's really embarrassing for me to talk about it right now...but I didn't seem to care what other people thought if I behaved that way then. *Shudders*   We stayed at the beach resort we always stay at when we go to Malacca: Tanjong Bidara Beach Resort. It's really not those kind of luxurious man-made ones with presidential suites and all...on the contrary, it's quite the opposite. It's all natural, and the couple that runs it has already had 4 children, I think. So they hardly have any time to maintain the resort. The result: cockroaches on top of the cupboards, in the toilets, dead lizards on the ground with blood oozing out of their bodies and ants crawling all over them. Really...if they can't man it, then they should just close down. But it's such a pity...it's been there ever since before I was born and now I'm selfish and snobby enough to say it should be closed down. Besides, that's the only way that the family can earn a living and support thier family.  But I pity them...the resort's failing. All sorts of people used to stay there...Dutch people, German people, French people. (Dad showed me the gusetbook and I noticed that his comments were the most 'chim'est of them all:P) The resort's really quite close to the sea...which means that they would keep having to put rocks on the edge of the beach to prevent the water level from rising and completely submerging it. Then the resort would lose all appeal...it's only appeal is the sea. If rocks completely cover the beach, how the heck are the people gonna get down and up them??? Pity really....it's a nice place and the people are decent enough. Dad always gives them humoungous tips. I saw him giving the manager, also the father of the family, pushing away an apparently huge sum of money in his hands back to Dad.   Yup...that was about all the fun I had...I dunno about everybody else but I don't think they had fun either. To make matters worse, the morning that we had decided to swim, it was raining. How irritatingly frustrating. We especially came out of the house at night so that we could swim early the next day. Sheesh.   By da way, I was Dad's navigator in the car. There were three cars in all belonging to my uncle and auntie respectively, including our car. Since the others were quite unfamiliar with the roads in that particular are of Malacca, Dad was chosen to lead the pack. Which meant that I was absolutely essential so that all three of the cars wouldn't get lost. But...*smiles sheepishly*...I did fall asleep at times. Who could blame me??? The roads there were very long. Of course I had to fall asleep some time right? I'm not the driver. When I fall asleep, Mum takes over. But really now. Dad says that she's not such a good navigator as I am...Ok I admit he didn't say that...it was only that whenever Mum navigates, she sometimes gets blur. Which results in heated squabbles between my parents.   Sorry if I've written too much.I still have one more thing to say. On the journey home, we stopped by this diner at the side of the road. Then there were so many cute guys there who tried to attract my attention. They said I was pretty when I walked past them. I was trying really hard not to let my butt swing as I turned my back on them. God this is embarrassing...but at least they were cute. Hee.   Sorry boys...I already have a guy. :D :P His name is Brenton and he's an ACS(I) guy. Look, my fingers ache from typing too much so I'll tell you the story...some other time. To keep the suspense. HAHA!!! INURFACE! O% relevance...anyways, I gtg.   2dals!
