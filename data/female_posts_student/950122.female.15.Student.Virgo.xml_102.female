What if later on ni the future, 'The World' really came to be? Or at least something like it? Not necessarily with evil entities and wishes and hacking, but more of a completely 3D MMORPG. Of course I'd play it (or at least try to); there's no question. I was wondering tho if I'd actually lose myself to it. I wouldn't be surprised.  Online personas are like second lives. That's what I think. I mean, when I go online, I can be a completely different person. I have different friends, different opinions, different attitudes. There's me, and there's online me. I love going online. I'm part of many online communities, forums, sites, and I've met so many nice people through this. But I've also met my own share of arses. That doesn't hold me back tho. It's like, going online is like an RPG game. Going out, meeting people, interacting. You can be any hero you want. You can be you, you can be typical, you can be neutral, you can be misunderstood, you can be plain ebiiil. Maybe it's this about the internet that has me so drawn to it: Being an unmasked (yet masked) person you can't (or plain aren't) be in real life. I admit, I do not have a nice, thriving social life. I keep in touch with more people who live in different countries than I do in my own. Honestly, I feel so spaced from the people in my own country than with those elsewhere. Yeah, it worries me like hell, and it's horrible when I know nothing about those close to me. I feel so.. different. And I space myself from others because I feel so close, yet so far. Physically, I'm here, but socially, I'm somewhere else. It's stupid, now that I think about it. Sometimes, you just want someone to talk to, but you don't know who.
