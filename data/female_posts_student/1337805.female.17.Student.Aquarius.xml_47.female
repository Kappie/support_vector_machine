He is the best guy ever. He is so cute, so adorable, and funny, and I know he loves me just as much as I do, but in a much different way. We have the best time together, when we are together. And even though I know I have never kissed him, I know what it would be like, electrifying, passions soaring, most indepth and complex. His touch can send me through the roof. I try and imagine the next time I see him, how insanely wonderful it will be and it's impoosible. And I know, no matter what, even if I told him how I felt, he woud never ever ever feel the same way, because our differences are so..well....it wont happen. Unless he changes. That sounds selfish, but if you knew who I was talking about, you would understand exactly where I might be coming from.  The other, Rob*, is someone I know in the neighboorhood area. In fact, I wrote about him yesterday. And our interests are so different, no one would ever see our union coming. A friend of mine has pried out that he does like someone from youth group...So I'm not out of the ruling. And how forbidden it would look. Our interests are so varied, we have no school friends in common, just con friends, and no one, not even our parents would see it. I've known him since kindergarten, and I've liked him since around grade 3/4...I used to have this magazine picture of the Yellow Power Ranger on my dresser, where I could see it ever night, and I wrote his name on it, with hearts...He wasn't my first crush, no that was in grade 2 or 3..I can hardly remember.   Sean, I've tried. And I've learned this one major fact, the one fact that I know means I will never be with you. You like running free, having the pick of the litter, or whoever is at your recent disposal, and not having to worry about cheating. That's great, worthwhile, fun for a while. The difference between me and you, is that I need someone. Even if I have the running wild for a while, I need a guy to fall back on at the end of the day and say everything I want to hear, and mean it, not saying it just cause it'll make me happy. I need the commitment. And it lets me live. I mean, at least when I am grown up, sure, I might not have had all the free range fun you've had, but I've experienced the heart break. And I'll get out, and be with guys, and yes, I'll be hurt, but I'll know what it's like, and be prepared. You have never been hurt like that in your life, and I know that when you get out, it'll be harder for you. Women have names for people like you, people who fuck and run. They're called players. And they don't get far. It will be sad to see you down in the dumps, loking for a lay while I'm getting it all, the love and the warmth. And you'll never experience the happy warmth that someone can give you, someone you are going out with. It'll be a new feeling for you. And maybe you'll react to it in a horrible way. Time will tell. I know now, that after posting this, you'll read it and IM me, demanding reasoning, and trying to convince me how you think, and you take on it all, trying to convice me that I'm wrong. Get used to it, sometimes you are. And then you try and explain yourself over the phone, with your reasoning that you cant express yourself fully on the net. That's a lie. Anything you say on the net, is what you say on the phone. It's the same. Just you can say it faster, and if I hang up on you, you can call back. It's hard.  I'm not even sure now if I want to talk to you. It takes me a while, a long while, to realize the emotional pain, and abuse I've been in. Hell, last summer I was a mess, what with the situation with Evan and Will on top of each other, and the added sterss of parents. And I get to realize now, the controlling feeling. And I'm getting it from you. And your "critical eye". Start apologizing guy, cause you hurt my feelings. A lot. And you turned me into the person that'll do anything for a shot at you. Your comments, when you were at my house, about my weight, or anything related, hurt, and I felt that if I changed that, I would get you. And I started. I lost nearly 30 pounds, thanks. Very unhealthy. I gained it mostly back, and when I got sick, stayed at the normal level. And according to the height and weight/obeseity chart in my doctor's office, I'm at a very normal size. So go away, screw you, stop planting the weeds of controling. I've gardened, and threw you in the compost. Bottom line. Have fun with you life, and if you do make it out, and last to be something, and not a bum on the street wonderign where your next lay will be, call me. I wanna know what it was like going through the stages where you realized being a player wasn't going to make it. I'll be in the psychology office, being a shink, doing what I love, and analizing.     *names have been changed to respect my pride
