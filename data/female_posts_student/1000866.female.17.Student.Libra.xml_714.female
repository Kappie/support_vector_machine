After the trumpet sectional, which was really difficult to get through. Those kids have serious  retention issues. It's dissapointing. It was stressful. Anyway, after that, I came home, ate some food since I was starving and decided I'd read my book since I didn't have anything to do for a bit. I read two paragraphs then fell asleep until 7:30. Hah. So much for reading. So, I woke up too late to go to the mall, but it was okay because I ended up going out with Chris instead. We've been trying to hang out for like, two weeks but neither of our schedules permit it. Crazy. That's ok. We hung out and it was fun. Matthew joined us as well.   I was thinking today of all the funny stuff from last night too. Like Kath, MC and myself all cramming into a sleeping bag and sleeping together because it was so cold. Only girls can do that without it seeming odd. If guys did that, they'd be looked at like they were insane. Interesting. Well, it was a fun night and I wont forget it. I'm excited to do the walk again next year. :) Much Love. I'm out.
