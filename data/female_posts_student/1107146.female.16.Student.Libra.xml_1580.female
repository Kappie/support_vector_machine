They range from 3-11ish per chapter.  2)  When are we supposed to get our schedules?  Note, when you get them, post them.  3)  Will, and Josh, when you feel better, do yall want to go to the library sometime and work on this freaking essay?  It's not that hard, just sort of long and tedious, just thought it might be better to do it with someone.  Rosie can't come, but maybe we can do it.  And maybe Liz, when she gets home from wherever she is... Need to do it within the next weekish though.
