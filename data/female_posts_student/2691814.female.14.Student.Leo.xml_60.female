So anyway...yes it is morning..josh and keith went to sleep around 2:30 HAHA me and Francesca beat them. 7:45 AM!! lol. She didn't stay the night so i was up playing SIMS (building houses) my fave part. But while they were playing cards and playing games on the computer, i was safely tucked away in my bed. Although the fan was on and it kept waking me up.  I keep having dreams that i am drowning or getting swept off into current. I'm checking my dream cards as I type.  Questions on the card: 1.Are you the person drowning, if not who is it?...i am the person drowning 2.If someone else is drowning are you trying to save them?...they're not drowning 3.Is the dream set in a river, lake or at the sea?...the sea...and a pool Now for the reading:This is about being or feeling overwhelmed so look at your waking life to see what you are feeling threatened by. If  someone drowns, it may meantsome of your feelings and creativity need to be taken care of. Much of our anxiety comes from situations that existonly in our magination. Response to Questions:A person or animal drowning suggests an aspect of your personality needs to be cared for. 2.(doesn't apply) 3. All water in some way signifies your own inner world of feelings but the sea often suggest meeting urges and wisdom lying beyond the boundary of your own conscious mind. What is it that you feelin the sea or river. Put it into words.  Hmm...i was at a beach...looked like daytona but at sunset. i was facing all the people and i was in water waste deep. I couldn't step forward to get out of the water. I could only go back if i wanted to move.I felt like i needed to get out desperately and join the people who were waiting for me. That was it. Blah.
