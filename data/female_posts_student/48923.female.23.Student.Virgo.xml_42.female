"i understand why 13 is a baker's dozen"  nyc commuters don't make for interesting bus rides.  a previous (from a former life) commute on a bus, every ride came with a story.  why didn't anyone ever tell me about mixing sundried tomatoes + pesto, eggrolls + chocolate, or chicken n dumplings with apple bread, before?
