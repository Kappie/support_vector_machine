I found inspiration from several websites when I simply typed in "things i want to do before i die" on Google.  These are not in any particular order. I have tried to categorize the items and in some cases clarify the meaning.  For instance I would like to visit all 50 states.  However just driving through or laying over at an airport does not count.    At any rate here it goes.  I hope you enjoy reading it and perhaps it will inspire you to make your own list.
