There is a point between obsession and cleverness....right guys?... Happy mode cause it's Friday and I'm listening to music. Hehe PSE was funny! Oh PSE is personal social education I think. So it's where we all sit down and talk about drugs and things. It's quite easy to say no to drugs. That is if you're not afraid of what your image will look like if you say no. If you have nothing to lose then you have nothing to gain. Ehe. Well it kind of works I guess. You just have to have a strong voice in your head waking you up. I don't have a go at people who take drugs, it won't do any thing. Any way, here's a fact: cannabis isn't actually as bad as smoking! The only reason that the British government won't make it legal is because they think that it'll lead you on to harder drugs. People take drugs to be happy, but I'm like that any way! Do you have to be that insecure to take them? What will people do to look good infront of their mates?!
