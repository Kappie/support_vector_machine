Plus I already got called on, so I'm safe for the rest of the class.  At least in theory.  I guess with my first name, and today being St. Patrick's Day, the prof thought I was Irish so he called on me.  But you heard it here first folks:  I am not Irish.  At least not wholly.  I've got a little bit of everything in my heritage, so for all I know there may be some Irish there as well.    It's been a long day.  Didn't sleep so well last night, so I got droopy earlier.  It was hard for me to get my work done.  A girl in the cafeteria later told me, when she saw me doing my reading, that it was no wonder I was so smart because I was doing my work.  When I expressed shock - not that I don't think I'm smart, but it is so often that we don't recognize it of others, especially for someone like me who doesn't speak that much in class and so often fumbles around when she does - she told me that she thought I was one of the smarter girls she'd met in the school.  It is nice to receive such unsolicited compliments completely randomly.  I post this not to pat my own back, but just because it really surprised me.  I don't even think most people know who I am here, and that gets frustrating, but this girl does know me, she actually remembers that she's met me and recognizes me, and that is gratifying in this world of perpetual strangers.    That said, why do we always put more stock in what total strangers tell us than what our friends tell us?  I know people who think I'm smart, but they are my friends, and when they say it, while I love and believe them, I take it with a grain of salt, because who wants to insult their friends, even if it requires a little fudging of the truth.  I don't have a ready answer to this question.  Now it is the break, and there are a sea of happy faces around me, engaging in playful banter and small-talk, enjoying each other's company, and generally having a good time.  And I feel very lonely and isolated among them.  I feel close to tears.  But I can't let myself cry, not now, not around all these people.  So I bury my head for a few moments, feigning frustration with the heat of the classroom, and avoid the eyes of others.  I take off my glasses so that I can't tell if other people are looking at me.  And luckily for me, class begins again before I have a chance to drive myself insane with these thoughts.  It's kind of funny to think of law school as keeping me sane, rather than driving me insane.  I think it's a little bit of both sometimes.  Okay, so that's over.  I feel much better now.  Guess I should get back to work, and actually start paying attention.
