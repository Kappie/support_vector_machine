You begin to see the people who give a shit  those who don't. Sometimes it really hurts. I am very quick to say, thats it, we're done. Both with friends  with guys. Its so hard b/c I spend most of my time running around trying not to get to close to someone, or balancing shit out so I am not vulerable. But isn't that the whole point to life?? You would think that I enjoy shutting myself off from people  pulling away whenever someone has gotten too close. Its like, I can't handle REALLY being with someone, in the good times  the bad. I think b/c I'm afraid that no one will do that for me.  then of course the self pity follows, which is annoying as hell, even to me. A lot of times I just search  try to grasp the meaning to all of this shit. What is the fucking point? can someone tell me? all of these fights  debates about who is right  who is wrong...well who fucking cares? I don't. It just all seems so petty  pointless. Right now, I don't feel close to anyone  I don't want to. Its all just one big hassle. You expect for people to  care  they don't. Cry me a river. Its life  think that we are all destined to go through a large portion of it alone, but we will never be independent, we will always need others to help us along the way.  So lets get this shit out, so I can go back to sleep. I have been having girl problems,  I'm scared theres something wrong. I expressed this to evan  instead of checking on me (since I almost passed out today  don't have enough $ to go to the doctors) he borrowed some money from his friend, went out to eat sushi  watched a band. He said he'd check on me later. WEll, he didn't  I think to myself...for someone who professes their love for me so often you would think that they would atleast care enough to call. well, he doesn't  once again I am stupid for depending on people, or thinking they would give a shit. It hurts  I am sorry for caring. There it is. None of this tough bullshit. So, I am inclined to break it off. This is wasting my time, but there is nothing that I have more of. So, again, what is the point? I got my feelings hurt...wahh, I want to dump him b/c of it....thats childish.... now I am confident that I am really evolving  growing as a person..... So many of us are in the dark. I just want to shed some light on who I really am. I am angry  hurt but I don't want that to take control of me. Those emotions are ones that we all experience, they are apart of life. But if we dwell  wallow in them too long it becomes a waste  we miss the things  the people that are important in our lives. I am confused as what to do. I'm sure the answer will become more clear with time. I guess I just have to let it go. Other people have much larger problems, its funny b/c I can hardly see that b/c I am so wrapped up in my own.  Goodnight
