Because there is no one that hates winter the way I do. No one has quite the passion I have about summer. I take it all in. I grasp every moment. Because the season is so fleeting, that I can't let it slip through my fingers without loving every moment. Even when things get me down...I may be a little upset, but it's a calming sort of pain. Mmm...it's the most wonderful thing in the world. I wish I wasn't so depressed in the winter. You can't imagine what it's like to feel as though you're only living half of a full life. If I were to keep living like this, and I died at 60, it'd be like dying at 30.  I'm listening to a good song. It's cheering me up a little bit.  *Sometimes I fear that I'll daydream my life away. I'll just wake up one day and realize that none of it is real.*  See you crazies tomorrow.
