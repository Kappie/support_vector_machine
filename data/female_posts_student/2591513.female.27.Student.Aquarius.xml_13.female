The person who cut us off on the freeway; forgetting to make a phone call; someone not following through on a promise; the house not being just right...When we hold on, we are the ones who suffer.  Little things are little things, and we can fit almost everything into that category. Move on."  Talk about hitting home.  It is exactly what I told myself I would try and do....not sweat the small stuff and always look at the big picture...afterall, isn't that the part that matters?
