This blog i use more for like...real thoughts i feel like sharing with the world. however, my new blog, which i share and co-operate with my fellow mild-mannered reporter turned valiant righter of wrongs, kailey, will offer more of a comedic view of things and more than the occasional odd rant on...whatever strikes us. Hopefully this will be entertaining.If anything, its something to do with my boring summer days. This blog i think will be more of us just talking and being weird and funny, as opposed to this one which is strictly an outlet for my ideas...this is like a big log of speeches i would have made from a soapbox on a corner with no one listening to me. not that theres anyone listening now, but anyway.... so check out my new blog.  ill still be updating this one too, its just...a different part of me for you to laugh at and shake your head at and say "well, at least im not that pathetic...." anyway, since there are no links on this blog and i dont want to change the template because i like this style better than the rest of them (save jellyfish...but thats what i use on my other blog...and they cant both be the same, thats maddness!) i'll just have to tell you the site:   Visit  urlLink "Sombrero de *fashon*"  (pronounced "fah-shone")
