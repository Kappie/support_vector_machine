I haven't had a nice long conversation with him in months... and I always feel like I have so much more insight to the direction I want my life to go after I hang up the phone with him. By "direction" for my life, I mean spiritually. And I use that term very lightly... because I'm by NO means a person who preaches religion to people... but I realize that I need to devote more time to God and such. I'm not going to start trying to get friends of mine to go to church more, or anything either... or look down on people who aren't going to church. But, for myself, I need to get the church life I once knew back. I think it'd be in my best interest to involve myself in the youth group... and/or go to church with Naomi and Clint on Sundays. Anyhow... we also just had a good conversation. He told me all about how he proposed and all... it was just nice. I miss my long chats with Justin. I miss the time(s) that we would sit and talk until 5am about our lives and what we wanted to do with them. Okay, that's all I really have for now... Ricky should post something on his blog... he's got some interesting things to tell about our adventures the past 3 days. ;) HAHA
