And that means having to finally say goodbye to all of of my senior friends who are leaving....I am going to CRY! Ugh, I can't imagine going to school and not seeing them every day. Its going to be hard. Anyways, its coming along, although this week was a little stressful. And by a little I mean a lot. I've caught a nasty cold, and I stayed home on Wednesday. This whole double casting thing is just...not cool. It just makes it twice as hard to get your part down. A lot of us are really getting annoyed with it all, especially since the cast will not shut up. Meh, thats what Weber gets for casting 80 people. The chorus would have been just fine if she had taken out about 15-20 of them. They can barely fit on the stage! Oh well. We have our tech rehearsal tomorrow, and I have an audition to sing the national anthem at the Schaumburg Flyers game. And then I'm going to Battle of the Bands to see Richie Ribando and the Swingin Six. That should be very entertaining. Busy day tomorrow.
