You laughed at my corny jokes,  shared your music in the halls,  Took me out and claimed me yours,  and gave me the world.   I knew when i gave up on love,  when the tears began to flow,  spending more time with your friends,  i was just your whore.  I had changed too much for you,  Needs you couldn't full-fill (sp)  Dreams you wouldn't be part of,  We grew apart by miles.   I know that i can love another,  when my soul is fully healed,  when my heart stitches together -  all the pieces that it lost.  Slowly you fade from my veins,  whispers of forever - gone,  promises of love - forgotten,  I will be happy and survive,  Learning to breathe on my own.
