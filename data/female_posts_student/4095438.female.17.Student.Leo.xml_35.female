Or maybe because I'm unsure as to where I'll be after October 5th; my location depends on some asshole US immigration officer. NOT the kind of person you want to hang these sorts of things on.  If I get turned away at LAX, I'll head up to Vancouver in Canada, collect my bags and continue on my itinerary to Toronto and London. I think then I'll do one of 2 things: 1. Get a job and work for a couple of months in London or 2. Spend a couple of weeks with Steph B and then head home through Singapore. Each has problems.. #1 is a problem because I have nowhere to live and there'll be a gap between when I get to London and when I start earning. In other words, I'll have to borrow some cash from my parents and stay in a London hostel (which isn't an issue in itself.. apparently there's some area where all of the Australians live in share houses or something). #2 is a problem because I don't think I'm quite ready to go home and even if I was, what would I do between now and February when I move to Melbourne? I suppose I would work. But then, I could do that in London and continue my world travel thing I got going on. Maahaa.  I have to volunteer tomorrow. And if the novelty was wearing off a month ago, it's well and truly gone now. I don't know why organisations go and recruit volunteers only to have them spend 2 hours on a bus and arrive with  nothing to do .  What  is the point? Why not tell me I'm not needed so I can give my services to someone who does? ... HAHA okay, okay so I can stay home and build my site.  I'm going to bed now that I'm all overwhelmed. I WILL reply to emails tomorrow. Dooooo it.
