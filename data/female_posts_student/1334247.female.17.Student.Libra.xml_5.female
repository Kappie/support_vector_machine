Inertia got 1st in Prep, too. Rock on.   I go back to work in a couple days. Aaghh...I dont want to go back to HyVee. I'll still look for another job though. Look is the key word, no one is really hiring.   Thursday I had to memorize a 2-3 minute famous speech for Drama, I got an A!!! It was really hard to memorize, but I did really well. Mine was "Care in the Community" by Princess Diana.  A movie Nichole doesn't recommend: My Boss's Daughter
