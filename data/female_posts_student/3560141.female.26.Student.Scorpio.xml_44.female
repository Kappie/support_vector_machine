I might be able to say goodbye to fixed incomes and no savings because of limited loan funds....  If I can draw blood, collect urine, and check vital signs of middle aged couples in search of life insurance, I can wave goodbye to all these things...  My life sucks...as of this moment it really really sucks...my gums itch...I've gained like four pounds from merely drinking water with lots and lots of sushi, I'm surrounded by the negativity of two dueling roomates, one of which who fights with his fiancee every night over wedding details, and then chooses to share these feelings because god only knows that's what I really want to hear, is all the matrimonial bliss talk...everyday, I am potentially at risk for being attacked by overzealous psychiatry patients..today it was almost being decapitated by a connect four board....I have no friends outside of medicine, so basically, coversation can only run the gammet of blood draws, urine collection, vital signs, and other students potentially being decapitated, a recap of what I am loathing at this point...I don't see the light....not even a small night one...I am drawn to a character who thinks that I'm way too mushy, and I think my calls are even starting to smother him...I don't even know what to talk about anymore, because my days are so blooming boring....I went to a dreamy club in the clouds this weekend, and spent an hour smoking, an hour dancing, an hour surrounded by good looking guys who were all intelligent, and guess what all were in medicine...but what card did I pull the one where I'm totally turned off by anything medically related, so basically any line these guys would pull..."I'm a resident...I'm in my first year of residency...I really know what it's like in your shoes, I could give you some good advice...here's my number...blah, blah, blah..", I refuted with a resounding..."I'm dropping out..not interested."   I'm not really dropping out, maybe mentally I am....as in...outside of studying on my own, or being in a hospital mandatorily, or working for this life insurance gig...I'm not in medicine, I'm actually a free lance anything else....  I work out, I could train for a marathon, but with my addictive/perfectionist personality...I would begin to think 24 miles and 96 lbs. just wouldn't cut it... I watch movies, I could go to more independent film opennings....but with who, a lesbian interested in, "picking up chicks",  the Armenian, who thinks being sensitive is beating the other personalities out of pschizophrenics, the new "doctors" I just met, so I can listen to them rave about my grave future, or my one female counterpart...who is surgically attached to her boyfriend, and therefore more blissful matrimonial bullshit...maybe the one little guy who had a rotation with me who had great taste in books and food, might be fun, but surprisingly, he's a little too philosophical for my tastes...I love to be abstract, but what's fun about discussing life's truths...my blog is all I really need....maybe the new girls I met on this rotation in Psychiatry...one of whom has a weird conspiracy theory neurosis, involving a serious problem with trust and who always assumes I'm hiding something...one of whom could be a man, I'm not sure....one of whom talks about one thing all the time, no seriously, all the time...one of whom has the most perfect life, as previously discussed in another blog, well, she is that perfect Indian girl....maybe she would rub off on me and destroy my plot to be the black sheep forever....who's got the neuroses now??  YOu know what..maybe it's noone else's fault but my own...meaning I used to be the type who could revel in being compatible with all of these aforementioned personalities, but lately, I'm just tired...tired of trying, so without effort I can only hope to redefine loneliness....  I could go to the beach in these last remaining weeks of summer here in the city...but why would I purposefully want to contract some fungal infection or step on someone's used needle, the beaches are a festering microbial playground here....the Jersey Shore is just not that accessible...  I could play sports since playing tennis involves an hour commute and court fees that amount to only thirty dollars an hour, or play golf, at a course also one hell of a commute with huge course fees, but I could join my neighbors for a friendly game of handball....sounds attractive right?  Oh what am I complaining about...I get to go to some obscure openning of a movie this week and I'm going to see a show next week, and I'm going to the Park this weekend to partake in some South Asian networking thing...volunteering and hoping this will take the edge off of desperacy when I meet other people outside of medicine, because you us South Asians, so diverse in our career choices...great....  anyone...anyone wanting to trade boring seemingly lonely existence in Queens, for a life unchartered and full of spontaneity....
