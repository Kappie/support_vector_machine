I'm going to miss some of the seniors sooo much!!!!  All of my boys (the seniors of the hockey team) are leaving in about a week!!!!!  Gosh i'm going to miss them!!  Me and Sarah want to hatch a plan to fail all the seniors we want to stay....but people we don't care about can go on....like the hockey players' girlfriends lol.  jk, we're not doing anything.  Anyways, this year has been quite the ride and i'm going to miss all of class of 04 and everyone thats going to TAMS!!!!  haha today at lunch, me, taylor and nathaniel saw this guy all lifting his shirt up to scratch himself or whatever and he was wearing red boxers with white snowflakes!!!!  it was so funny.  Nathaniel was all like "mercer what would you do if i did that?", i told him i would point and laugh at him.  haha not really, i wouldn't laugh that hard.  Oh yeah and nathaniel, if you're reading this, what was so funny about me not really wearing makeup next year or the year after that lol!?!?!  You give me this grin when i said i might do that and what was that all about!?!  jk, just giving you a hard time.  so yeah.....school was boring.....except for the part where i ran all the way to the auditorium with all these seniors that were also running to get my yearbook.....that wore me out because its hard to run in my skirt without it coming up!  Speaking of skirts coming up, mine almost did in front of this guy after school when i was walking outside!!!  And he noticed and he was all like "whoa that was close, haha".  omg SO EMBARASSING.  anyways....yeah  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  p.s- wish me luck as i do something incredibly reckless and stupid tonight....something that could possibly screw me over emotionally for the rest of my life.
