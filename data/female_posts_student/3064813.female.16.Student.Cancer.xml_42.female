Besides that minor thing, things are going just dandily in the little life of me.  I got the Motion City Soundtrack CD (finally) which is good but not as good as The Reunion Show, which is what I am now craving.  By a strange twist of fate, this is also the CD which I have conveniently left behind in  my happy little room.  Yeah, well I see my buddy coming, so BYE!
