I'd rather have an enemy for a thousand years and win him as a friend in the end, than have a friend for years and lose our friendship over unreasonable matters. Why can't people just look more on the bright side of things rather than wallow in misery because of the dark sides of it. Life is too short to waste over hatred.   I find it so hard to forget, but that’s not my point. I probably just don’t get it. Is it really that hard to forgive?  And after all that we've been through, I think nothing could ever be more stupid than to throw everything down the drain and forget all the places we've been in just a snap. Life really sucks under best circumstances, but why look at it that way?   i want to be heard. i want to be noticed. i want to be answered.  Apparently, they eyes were blinded for my appeals and the ears were deafened for my voices.  And now, my eyes are fuzzy from tears.
