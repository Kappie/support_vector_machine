Changing it into physical pain that i can control and i can stop when it become too much.    I'm going to draw a picture,  a picture with a twist,  I'll draw it with a razor blade,  and draw it on my wrist   Exactly how i'm feeling. the cutting doens't hurt. It's the pain i'm cousing everyone else by doing it that hurts. so you think i'd stop. u wouldn;'t think it but it's addictive. I get a high everytime i run the blade over my skin. i have a about 20 cuts now. The cutting keeps me from being suicidle. i hate thinking about dieing more than anything. sometimes it feels like the only way, but i hate it. more than ANYTHING. i hate being a teen and i hate thinking that there are other ppl out there that feel the same as me. i dont' want ppl to have to do this, i mean.. to some extent it makes me feel better but it also makes me feel worse. i dunno how that works. ugh i have so much bloddy homework. better go do that.
