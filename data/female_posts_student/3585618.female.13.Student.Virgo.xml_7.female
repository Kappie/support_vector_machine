It's not all luck and no play for Greece... they are DISCIPLINED... and I like discipline *winks*   Can't WAIT for the FINALS!   My Dad just fixed the screen for our home theatre thingy... and it is SUCH A DISSAPOINTMENT that the normal TV isn't connected to it... Imagine... EURO... in a 2.3 by 1.3 screen!  *wow*  basically... I don't want to go to school, I want the HP 6th book to come out, I want the Olympic Games to begin, and I want Greece to win EURO... oh yesh... and I am a genius :D  see you guys(my classmates) later in school
