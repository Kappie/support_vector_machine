WRONG!  i have problems too, i have bad days, days that make me want to cry myself to sleep, days that make me wonder why i even bother... i'm human too, ya know?  so i'm feeling really sensitive as of late... i can take a joke, i can.  i know i dish it out enough, i should be able to take 'em back.  but, the thing is... i get made fun of a LOT wheni i'm home.  my friends, and especially my family- i am the butt to all the jokes.  i kid you not!  i can only take enough jokes, ya know?  why me?  why do they feel they can make fun of me, are they perfect?  does it make them feel better about themself to make fun of me?  i just wish the jokes could decrease, even just a little would be nice.    my 23rd birthday is on friday.  i don't have any plans (on my actual birthday).  i'm having a really cool part/bar thing on saturday night, which i'm REALLY looking forward to, but nothing for friday.  i realize it's my birthday, i should probably make a plan or something... but i sort of wished someone would suggest something, or offer to take me out.  i know that probably sounds really selfish... i don't mean for it to.  i think i'm famous for wishing people could read my mind.  i don't know why i do it...   btw... donz thanks for the comment!  i didn't think anyone read this thing.  thanks!  :)  i'm out.
