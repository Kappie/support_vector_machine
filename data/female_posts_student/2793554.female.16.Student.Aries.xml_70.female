I feel like my brain has fallen out of my ears and im too stupid/lazy/brainless to notice/care. only 3 days of school left. Thank fucking god.   I was walking down the street yesterday to the bus stop with Liz and Shai and i saw john kerr. Wow. What a swift kick in the ass for me. Its people like that that make me want to go kill the world for being so stupid and become a straight-edger. I cant even believe he's still alive. I thought about him for like, 4 hours after i saw him. Wow. The last time i saw him, he was walking around in the daytime and being all drunk and insane. And apparently since then hes gone to jail and been in and out of like, 6 foster homes. Its really amazing to me, like... i bitch about how shitty my life is but im a spoiled little shit and i have a good life. That kid's life has just been one shit sandwich after another. And now hes living with his mom ( WHO IS INSANE AND HAS A MULLET) but i hope that goes ok for him. I really hope something wonderful happens to that kid. Itd be about fucking time.   And all my friends are leaving tuesday! Especially Melissa and Jessie! i dont even know what ill do without them. Go insane? or... ::gasp:: get new friends? I dont know. I wish i could go with jessie to europe, that would be so much fun, but i cant. And i forget when melissa is coming back, in a long time i think. Sauce all over that sauce.  i woke up next to dylan this morning ::smile::  Bleh. Finals week sucks. YAY! BUT I ONLY HAVE 5 FINALS LEFT EVERRRR! WHEEE!!!!  i wish i had some new cds.   meep.  ~abby
