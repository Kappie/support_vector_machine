I'll get to this whenever there is ample time.  Did I just say "whenever there is ample time"?   Does that make sense?  Does anyone care?  Hmm.  May these questions plague you until you can no longer sleep. Or not because that would be terrible and I would want no one to wish such a thing on me.  I am so tired. Goodnight, kids.
