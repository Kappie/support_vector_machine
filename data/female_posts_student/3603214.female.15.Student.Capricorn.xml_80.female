I'm sorry but ugh...it was so sad.  Looking back I clearly see What it is that's killing me Through the eyes of one I know I see a vision once let go I had it all  Constantly it burdens me Hard to trust and can't believe Lost the faith and lost the love When the day is done  Will they open their eyes And realize we are one On and on we stand alone Until our day has come When they open their eyes And realize we are one  I love the way I feel today But how I know the sun will fade Darker days seem to be What will always live in me But still I run  It's hard to walk this path alone Hard to know which way to go Will I ever save this day Will it ever change  Will they open their eyes And realize we are one Still today we carry on I know our day will come When they open their eyes And realize we are one  Will they open their eyes And realize we are one (its hard to walk this path alone hard to know which way to go) Will they open their eyes and realize we are one (lost the faith and lost the love when the day is done) Will they open their eyes And realize we are one  Seriously..if you heard the song, you might understand where I'm coming from...just maybe...So now I must go because I have to continue my summer reading *THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BOO!*, and I must go eat some ice cream because I had pizza earlier and it's a given.  ps. My wheatiness is really nice...I'm not like super red anymore..I don't even hurt! *YAY!*
