I make jokes about people, I gossip, I'm stubborn. Ugh, I hate me. I don't study enough, I'm a terrible driver, I can't get a job, I swear a lot. I don't trust people, I don't let people get very close to me, I reject people I like, I'm a social introvert. I've even beaten up my brother. My brother!!! My younger 11-year-old brother!!! (He was 9 or 10 when I beat him up though). I'm closed-minded and hypocritical. I'm very critical of other people (most of the time negatively). I'm such a terrible person.    I'm watching Fruits Basket hoping some of Tohru's mannerisms will rub off on me. Again I remind myself that I need to make cookies... But then, I have to write an essay for school first... beh, I find myself in a bind...    My brother is coming home Wednesday. All he's going to do is pick a fight, which doesn't help me out any.    Ryan hit me yesterday. Twice. Once for drinking a shot as a toast to the birthday of two aunts and an uncle, and again for fighting with Dave earlier that day. *sigh* I'm so terrible...    I can't poke him anymore either. Well, I  can , but I won't. He told me to stop, and I have to respect that. One more step towards becoming humble. Kyuu, he had to put up with my drunk aunt yesterday when he picked me up, and I still feel bad for that...    Why can't I just be a decent person? I think I'll listen to some Collective Soul and start on that essay now...   Current Mood:  Discontent
