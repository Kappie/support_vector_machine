About 8 o'clock I hear my nextel beep and then Jeff's voice yelling, "Baby! Rise and shine!" Not how I wanted to wake up. I drag myself out of bed and answer the phone. Turns out him and Ryan are at a job in Sanford and he's just gotten his truck  stuck.  Now he needs me to drive Ryan's truck all the way to the job so that they can use it to pull Jeff's truck out. I  reluctantly  agree. I put in my contacts,throw some clothes on and proceed to drive Ryan's truck to Sanford.  Note:  Ryan's truck is a big ol' F-350 Powerstroke 6 speed with huge tires. I'm about 5'7 and 110 pounds. This truck swallows me! None-the-less I get it there and they pull Jeff out and we begin to drive home when Jeff realizes he's lost his phone. So now we have to turn around and go back to the job to find his phone. I end up finding it after about half an hour later and by this time Jeff is behind schedule and getting  very  short tempered so he's driving home like a maniac and almosts rear ends a guy. His only reply is, "Well that'll teach the mother- BEEP er to get the hell out of my way next time." Lol.  Boys.  I'm finally home now and in one piece. I have my coffee so all is right the world. The beach thing is out of the question though so I think instead I'm going to go to the park with my sister and kick the soccer ball around. (Remind you I was a cheerleader and dancer in high school. When it comes to soccer I have no idea what the hell is going on. So this should be interesting.) Hope everyone has a great day.
