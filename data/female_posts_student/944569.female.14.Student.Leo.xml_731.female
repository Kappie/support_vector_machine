I'm going to go cherry picking with my younger cousins who love me very much (Gilbert, Lord of Hyperness and Impossible Kimberley) and my grandmother and my aunt and uncle and my father and mother and brother...... I get to go cherry picking in the damp rain, smelling the wet earth and leaves...That's life!
