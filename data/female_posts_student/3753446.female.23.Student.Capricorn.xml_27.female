"Road Trippin"  Eerie Erie  Expansive ripples Stretching beyond the asphalt Vision of water  Listening to Smashing Pumpkins can only last so long I've been sitting here for hours trying to find my favorite song Too bad I can't seem to find it I think I dubbed the tape wrong.  Miles of boring fields Are we there yet? Answer me! This just really sucks  grandly.
