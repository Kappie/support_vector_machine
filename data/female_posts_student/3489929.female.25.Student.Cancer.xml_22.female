We polished it off between the five of us in my department (sorry, Lisa). We all had a good time.   Now, let me quickly explain that Jefe has told me to keep an eye on Posh and to let him know when she does something she is not supposed to do (read magazines, call her boyfriend, eat at her desk, trim her arm hair with her scissors). I have to write him a report every day and give it to him. SUPPOSEDLY this was confidential and he was not to have told her where he is getting his information.   So Posh sees me get up, go into his office, and hand him my report, not knowing what it is. And two minutes later, he calls her in his office and apparently bitches her out, because she comes back in crying and when I ask her what's wrong she ignores me, and when I ask her anything work-related she looks right through me. Which totally pissed me off. So I went into Jefe's office after work and bitched him out because he had told me it would be confidential and now she's treating me like crap. So he tells me that THAT pisses HIM off (her acting like that) and he would take care of it, because he's pissed enough at her as it is.   Grrrrrrrrrrr. This is why I don't like narcing (narking?) on Posh. He always tells her it's me watching her. He claimsthat my reporting on and evaluating her is to teach me "management skills." Shee-it. Like he's ever going to replace her with me. Satan will be climbing the Matterhorn when that happens.   More and more like high school every day. That should be the company's motto.   I am planning menus for next week. My Gazelle came with an eating guide and I am going to try that at my mother's request. Apparently, her cardiologist has told her that Atkins is not a good idea, and she thinks I should do something else, for her own peace of mind. This is also why she will never allow me to get bypass, even though I don't want that either. My cousin, a.k.a. Newly-Skinny Slut, got the surgery and then also had to go back for plastic surgery to get rid of all of her excess skin. NSS has been sick ever since and can only eat enough food to fill your palm in one sitting. She keeps getting put back in the hospital for infections and shit. But to be honest, it's not necessarily the surgery's fault. She doesn't take care of herself and make sure she's getting all of the nutrients she needs. Plus, according to the family, she's begun to give it up to every guy who gives her a second glance, which is not much different than she was in high school, so I'm not sure why everyone in the family is surprised by her behavior now. But at the same time, she's a young mother (her baby is only two), and newly divorced, and hardly working- her mother (Lady Di) is paying all of her bills. She's acting a little crazy for someone who should be a bit more responsible.   And I'm one to talk.   But anyway, I'm a chickenshit when it comes to surgery and hospitals, so I totally would never do bypass. And I get so easily tired of Atkins anyway. I think I will try Tony Little's plan, and if all else fails, there's always Subway.
