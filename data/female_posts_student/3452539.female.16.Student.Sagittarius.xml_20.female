Marie was not around for rides which meant that I had to fend for myself, which is also known as trying to remember where the bus went, and when it did so.  I headed out at 7:03 AM and stood there for several minutes talking to the construction workers. I guess they were supposed to pave the gravel sections of road in front of my house this week but they are doing it next week. They may also do driveways,  ::evil grin::   Precalculus final = multiple choice = I did much better than I was anticipating.  Anyways, did not hike. Instead we wandered around PepBoys. There is a lot that I wish to put into my car, however, I would like a more race-worthy car. Or a standard transmission anyways. The automatic is just a better idea for now. The Laser will look good, but not race well ...can we say RICER? lol  Then, it was off to the pike. The first part was simply talking to my favorite person ever. Some serious conversation came up, but that is a good thing because we should be able to talk and I am extremely appreciative that he gave me the opportunity to listen.  Then, the awesome cars started coming out. Rims, neons, exhausts, mufflers, spoilers, kits, everything. A few races. I finally must give props to SATURNS ON STEROIDS lol. Evan kicked the crap out of Mike's Civic, not once, but twice. Not surprised. I am not seriously over-joyed by Civics, although I am fond of the Del Sols. New amp...sounds like ass. Sorry Tych.  Series of PINK cars. Hondas all. Funny! One guy had a blow-up doll for a passenger!   headed back, and scoped a couple side streets for short races tomorrow. I will probably video tape them. We want to bring the pike out to Ella Grasso lol.  Now I am letting the adrenaline cool a bit, I was allowed to drive. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE lol.  Bad part of evening: I knew only a handful of people and presence of drugs. ICK  Anyways, I am going to run, please take care. Have a good one!  -J9
