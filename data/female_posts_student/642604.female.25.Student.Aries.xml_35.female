     
      So I got nailed by my dog last night on my right arm with a nasty scrape and bruise, I slipped in the shower this morning and bruised my arm, my head and my ass and then at work today I got nailed by a twizler... don't ask... by my friend Plen right in the eye.  The day is not going well.  Oh well... off to beer pong....
