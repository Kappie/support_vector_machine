I mean we keep in touch but we havent seen eachother in like, 6 months since we're both really busy during the school year. We went to the mall together today and it was great.  We just get along so perfectly that we have so much fun together, no having to worry about annoying the other one w/ our quirky behaviors or anything like that [like extreme matchy clothing or tanning of strange body areas]! It just feels like we saw eachother like 2 days ago or something..haha its great! So we're gonna try to see eachother at least a few more times over the summer when we're both in town and not too busy!   After the mall i went to the library w/ my Dad! Got one of the books i needta read for school, along with 2 more that ive been wanting to read, and the 3rd in a trilogy i wanted! So now i have something else to keep me entertained! Tomorrow i have ortho..wow i probably shoulda been wearing my elastics more.  Oh well!
