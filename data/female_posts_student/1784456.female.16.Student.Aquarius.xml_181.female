So there we were in the middle of the field when it started thundering! It's was soooo funny! But it really hurt my legs! Every one got soaked and when it started thundering every one was screaming and running around. I just stood still and laughed! Oh and Lynne, I think I'd not pick any and run! Laura was thinking of taking Uno slam and playing it in the middle! Ehe...so we are sad. Oh and the time's all mucked up cause this is set on American time! Oh I get what you mean now... I'll go check!
