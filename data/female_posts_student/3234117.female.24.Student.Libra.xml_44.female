Well, that's how I felt about the new Seether CD. The song is old, but I really love the song "Broken". As soon as I got home, I blasted it on my stereo and sang it over and over again. Okay, I know you're thinkin' that's a little OCD and you're probably right!    Here are the words so you can join my fun and sing along too.....  I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh  I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away  I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well  I wanna hold you high and steal your pain    Chorus: Because I'm broken when I'm open and I don't feel like I'm strong enough  Because I'm broken when I'm lonesome and I don't feel right when you've gone away    The worst is over now and we can breathe again  I wanna hold you high- you steal my pain away  There's so much left to learn and no one left to fight  I wanna hold you high and steal your pain.
