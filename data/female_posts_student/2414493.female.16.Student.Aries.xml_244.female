Lawrence), Middlemarch (George Eliot) and the Portrait of a Lady (Henry James). All told, that's probably 1800 pages. Mrs. B recommended them all.   Driving home, I groan and wonder why I try to tackle this load especially since Light in August is less than appealing right now, and I should finish it just to have one Faulkner under my belt. But then I think, these are classics! They must've been wildly popular at some point in time. So I keep faith and hope they're worth reading. At least it was a bargain, ha.  Well, I just looked through Sons and Lovers. Seems interesting enough to read.   Got information for senior pictures today, but I won't be able to make the July 30 appointment. Senior pictures! It's just not time yet, I think. I guess I'll call them tomorrow and ask them to get me a later appointment.  More list-making. Things I have to do before I leave: return library books purchase the following:     contact solution     laundry hamper of some sorts     socks     batteries for flashlight     small trash can, perhaps pack, of course (taking down the pictures will be sad) fill out Amherst app find headphones  Well, now I want to start reading, but I'm also inclined to save that for Harvard. Hm. Dilemmas.  Tomorrow: I think I'll get up late, have lunch and then read until I have to go volunteer. That'll eat up enough time.  The only thing I'm afraid of now is boredom.
