I always just dreamed about meaningless things...things that had to do with what I had been thinking during the day or week, whatever. I've been having dreams lately though, not frequently however, about a guy, obviously a guy who is my boyfriend, but I don't know him.   The first dream I had was a while ago, but it involved a guy who I felt like I knew from somewhere, but couldn't place. The dream had something to do with a pool, I think we were swimming or something, or maybe he was swimming, I don't really remember, but it went something like that. The whole dream, which was pretty short, went just with me and him being together, just talking I guess, with a couple of other friends there at the pool with us. It had an abrupt end (I woke up before it actually came to an end), and when I tried to go back to sleep and finish it, it never "reconnected", so I just sort of forgot about it.   The second dream came just a couple of nights ago, and it had typically the same, err, "plot" if you will. It started (from what I remember) with me standing in front of this huuuuge swimming pool, like, staring at it I guess, and then this guy came up behind me and picked me up into his arms and carried me into the pool with him. The guy was different than the guy in my first dream, but still good-looking, and had some of the same features as the first guy - dark hair and eyes, taller than me. Anyway, this guy carries me into the pool, and then after that, it's like, he just has his arms around me and were hanging out, like, talking again I guess.  The one thing I distinctly remember about both of these dreams was the feeling I had during and after them. I felt totally secure (obviously, with a boyfriend), but it was deeper than that - I felt, so, happy...like, complete or something. Obviously that means that I need/want a boyfriend, but it's weird. I don't ever feel that way when I'm awake, in my "real" life. As a matter of fact, I feel that most guys that would be "boyfriend material" for most girls seem to be just another thing to deal with in my life...I guess I'm one of those people that everyone thinks are desperate when they say "I'm waiting for Mr. Right"...which I am, but I'm definitely not desperate.   Tonight I was desperately bored however, and I was thinking about my "dream guy", and so I googled about dream analysis. I went to this one site, most of the stuff that I had looked at on this site was bogus, but then I looked at this "dream dictionary" and looked under "P" for Pool. Here's an "explanation" for the whole pool thingy from both dreams:  "To see a pool of water in your dream, denotes that you will find much happiness and pleasure in love and marriage. Your social life will keep you busy."  This is what the dictionary said, and so I guess my "dream analysis" for the week is that when, or if, I ever find a guy that I like/love, it will by a happy relationship, which I guess is what I felt during and after the dream. I'm not exactly sure what the whole "social life will keep me busy" thing is about, but maybe I'll find out in my next dream...dun dun DUN!!!
