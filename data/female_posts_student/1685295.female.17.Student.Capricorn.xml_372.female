The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to Purgatory!  Here is how you matched up against all the levels: Level | Score Purgatory | High Level 1 - Limbo | High Level 2 | High Level 3 | Very Low Level 4 | Low Level 5 | Low Level 6 - The City of Dis | Very Low Level 7 | Moderate Level 8- the Malebolge | High Level 9 - Cocytus | Very Low  and i cant figure out why....i think i put in the same answers, except maybe this time i put in that i asked for forgiveness???  that one answer and my results COMPLETELY changed.  well my ratings seems to be the same....baaaah  so we graduated....and i have nothing to do!! lol we all need to hang out
