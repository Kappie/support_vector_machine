I mean, I know what I'm angry at and I know why I'm angry, but I can't express those feelings for some reason. And I am completely exhausted.       I'm going bowling tonight. I hope I try to have a good time. Christine's spending the night again. We'll listen to Jay some more.       Also, being so angry and exhausted I think is making me go crazy. I've been thinking of doing some stuff that I might probably want to take back later.
