I hope his life is better than mine. And I'm praying for a storm so I can just lie here, undisrupted and be lathargic. But IS that what I want?? I don't know anymore...I used to thrive thinking about the next CD i would buy and the next song I would write as if music could remedy everything. I think I genuinely believed that, but now I don't know. Am I just being cynical? Is it normal to feel like this? Is this how depressed people think? But I'm not depressed...I just have mood swings. Sometimes there's everything to live for and sometimes there's nothing. It all depends on the time, the light, the weather, and me. Me. I should probably just live for me instead of living for other people, and CDs, and storms, and long drives at night. Or maybe I should just live and not question why the way that I am. It's just that I've never been like that...
