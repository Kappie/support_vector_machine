Blogger can't smirk. And Blogger lets me tell multiple people (read: the world, if the world was interested in me, haha) the same thing at once. I can gather opinions. My thoughts reap me more food for thought, as I see things from other perspectives. Paper seems fusty, comparatively. It's tangible, but slower, duller, and I can't explain what I mean. Maybe removal is a good thing. I could come back refreshed, with more to offer than raincheck comments and tired opinions.   I decided to pull an allnighter instead of rushing myself. I like the night. I might take a walk.
