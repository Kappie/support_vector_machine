It was invigorating to see those mentally challenged kids and adults so happy to be there. They are fantastic people who, despite their disabilities, seem to savor a life of joy that is unwavering.     Henry, who is 35 and mentally challenged, is the sweetest person. He was so happy to see me and kept asking me all these questions. The main coach told me to tell him my last name is Smith because he is the type who would look me up in the phonebook and call me. lol. At intermitent times during our run, he would burst out asking me, "Are you a teeeeeeeenager?" He was the cutest, friendliest person ever.    There were many others in the group who I connected with. They are just the sweetest bunch of people you'd ever want to meet. Special Olympics is their life. It's what gets them out of bed in the morning. I'm glad I can be a part of such a pivotal aspect in their lives.     Guess what tomorrow is?! I'm sooo excited. I've got a fun day planned. I'm doing stuff with family in the morning, then meeting up with friends for dinner. In the morning, my family and I are going to go to Starbucks to get a drink, chat, and whatnot. Then we're going to walk a  urlLink labyrinth  near the Willow Glen area.  Of course, we plan on dining at  urlLink In-n-Out Burger  for lunch. My mom told me she doesn't have any presents for me yet, so she and my dad are going shopping in the afternoon. Then at about 6:30, everyone's meeting at my house and going over to eat dinner at  urlLink Tsing Tao --the best Chinese restaurant ever!  Then back to my place for some fun!  Excellent!
