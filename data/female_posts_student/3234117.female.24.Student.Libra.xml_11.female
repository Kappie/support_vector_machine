So with Bush's idea ... what's next -- forced psychoactive medications for children, adults, and elders ... how about forced lobotomies ... or better yet let's just put those poor bastards out of their misery.   It seems that this whole screening program is almost exclusively targeted to drug-treatments, so it comes as no surprise that it is endorsed by members of the American Psychiatric Association. In addition, it is also good to know that the big drug companies are contributing three times as much to Bush's campaign than to Kerry's. If this plan is ever implemented, the drug manufacturers will be the ones who will profit the most, especially since the newer and more expensive drugs will be used in this program's "state-of-the-art" treatment.
