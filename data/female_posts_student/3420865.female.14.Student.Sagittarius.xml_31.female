(this blog is about no one in particular, so maybe all of you reading this should take something from it.)  what is a friend? really. someone who makes an effort to do something with you when they're free, who calls you every now and then to see how you are, and takes an interest in your life, someone who doesn't talk about themselves all of the time and asks you questions about you... am i getting warmer? why is it so hard for people to do those things? and for the record, i'm not saying i'm a perfect friend. that's not it at all... i'm just saying some of the things i've noticed recently. could someone PLEASE tell me why, as soon as a "new love-interest" person/thing enters your life, you completely discard your friends? just think about it... and when you get the answer to it, please get back to me. this is a question that keeps me up at night, and knowing why would answer some other questions i have...  well, now that i've probably pissed off some/most of my friends off, i bid you farewell. (for now.)  for all of this, i'm better off without you.  kayte.
