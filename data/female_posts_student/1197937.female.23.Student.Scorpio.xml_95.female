According to my dad, one of the guys, we'll call him Old Poo, complains that he can no longer say more than five words to his wife without getting assaulted by a furious tirade. He attributes the case to the recent rise in popularity of korean dramas with chinese subtitles, which have caused his wife to lose all sense of reality and to demand unreasonable gestures of romance from him.  Another guy, Old Moo, complains that his wife won't tell him how much money she keeps in her separate account. He retaliates by stealing from her coin purse while she is asleep. A third guy, Little Foo (hahah, i couldn't help myself, but he is really short), complains that his wife has completely turned his two daughters against him. In his words, "I have lost control of the fort." So then I asked my dad what his role in all this wife-bashing was, and with my mom sitting across the dinner table, carving knife in hand, he says that he never had a chance to join in the talk because he has never lost a game. but if he did, he would have nothing to say because his wife never lets the dust settle in the house, does not care for expensive things, and knows just what to put in the filling of his favorite dumplings. men...
