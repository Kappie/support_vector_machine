I scored 2 of those goals, well 3 if you count the second shot I took, which bounced off a teammate's back and into the net. I won't lie...our team isn't awesome, but we definetly don't suck --although our standings do. We're either in 6th or 7th place (probably 6th after tonight) out of 10 right now...so we're slooooowly moving on up. YAY! The problem is that we don't have a place to practice right now, since elementary schools won't let us practice at their locations and other possible locations are booked up. It also costs about ninety ridiculous dollars an hour to practice at a soccer center. We may have the possibility of practicing in Ardrawson (I KNOW I spelled that wrong, but I'm too lazy to go spellcheck) - so we're keeping our fingers crossed.
