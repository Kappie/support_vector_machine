But Ellen's house doesn't look like Ellen's house, it looks exactly like my grandparent's house (my mom's parents), but it has a second floor... Maybe it is kinda like teh Schindhettee's house I dunno. So I am babysitting there and all of a sudden I realized that I forgot to pick up Katie to come and babysit with me. SO I try to call my mom but the phone is soooo freaking weird. It is like a pump like some pampered chef tool, and you have to pump to dial it. There are two other kids in the other room adjacent adn the door keeps swining open and they keep hearing me. So I am calling my mom and I tell her that I need her to pick up Katie and bring her here. I started babysitting at 5:30pm, but now it was 6 something and she still hadn't called wondering what was going on. The first time that I called my mom it was all fuzzy. I don't remember if it was the first or second time that I called her but I started almost crying on the phone and the door kept swining onoepna dn I didn't want the kids to see that I was almost crying so I sort of tried to slam it.   Then I remember another time looking at some sort of party music machine where you put in 5 cds or 5 tapes adn you put the little pamphlets from them on top of it and then it plays. I couldn't figure out how to make it work until I realized that you needed to have the CDs in there, but tehn I remmebered that all the CDs are in Ellen's car. There was a Blink182 CD in there that I really wanted to listen to but I coudn't and I waskind of sad.   Then there is some other part where we are travelling somewhere and I think that I am looking at a magazine and I call my mom again. I have no idea what I was takling to her about but I called her and it had somethignt o do with makeup but then about 10 seconds later I was like 'oh nm.'   Then there is this last part of my dream where I somehow met up with some people who were with their horsesThey were pretty highsrtrung and had a lot of leg motion in the front. They were walking down the raod in front of teh neighborhood where I live and somehow I ended up right next to some of these people with their horses. We cross teh roaxd and turned into my subdivision with them. Then we stood at teh end of the first road in that subdivision while someone was checking somethign out ebfore we went down to the right wher ethese horses were going. I was holding one and some other people were holding others.   Oh I think that before I was in teh car with Cassie driving somewhere back home maybe and we wenated to do someting, but we decided that we were going to go boarting on teh bayou in little boats which is why the person who was holindg the other horse was talking about how this horse was going to learn how to swim.   Anyways, so we are all standing around there at teh end of the road at the entrance to my subdivision and then someone comes back to tell us that we can't keep the ohrses there. When we turn around, and go out of my subdiviosn (all of this horse stuff is happeneing when eveining is falling outside) and cross mason road and we get to the other side, we see that the field at BEck Jr (the huge fenced in area is filled with horses and trailers and stuff. Before when we had looked at it from across the road, it just looked like there were a few horses over there like one or two. Then when we got to the other side, we started getting worried about taking the hroses there because we saw a cop car and thought that maybe it would be considered trespassing. While we were standing over there I figured out that all of these horses are probably here for the horse show. The othe rpeeople said that we could just sneak in but I told them that I didn't think that we could because they always ask which barn you are riding for and/or what classes you are entered in. So, then one of teh other people came up to our group and said that tyhey think that they have just tricked their way into getting in because they had just told the vet something about one of tehir horse's legs.   I don't remember anything after that... Very odd... :)
