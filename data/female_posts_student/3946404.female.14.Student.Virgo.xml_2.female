Altho my real name starts with "C" for real. I don't tell ppl like that tho since I grew up spelling my name with a "C", cuz it was supposed to be spelled with a "K". The nurse skrewed up on my birth certificate, so....I'm cursed with the "C". I have to ask like.. all my teachers if I can spell my name with a "K" instead of a "C" and they all just let me do it. So, whatever. If they don't I hate them for the skoo lyear...Hey, whatever. :P~~~~       So, anywayz.......Ed's playing the Wrestling thing again and it's the big man he made against this really skinny short midget, ET, lookin things...........And I wanna watch, So, I'll bbl!!!!! B ByeNeSS!!!!
