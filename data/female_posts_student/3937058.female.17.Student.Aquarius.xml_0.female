I shall have to write... sooo, yesterday me and Friely went to Guildford for a spot of shopping, quite random lol but luckily I had just washed and dressed when the aformentioned (how do u spell that?) Friely rang. It was tres good... Guildford has too many surfy shops tho, haven't we heard of sharing Guildford?? Greed, thats what it is! But anywho, we had a spot of lunch and then got cracking and we did get some barginagal things, not! lol. Sorry to word steal there Jess and Martin (wanker! - couldn't stop myself!). I do hate it when ppl do that! Know what I mean? Neway, back to my life. Then today, me and dearest mama and smelly Bethan went out for a drive, me behind the wheel obv. First we dropped some things at Oxfam (don't even think it! lol) then went to Highdown towers for a yummy carvery luncheon then to country gardens to get some teak woodstain, place mats and some gas lighter thingys. How exciting! (10 on the sarcasm-ometer). Driving was cool tho coz sun was shining, I was obv looking F.I.T (whatever!) and it was quite quiet out. The joy! heehee.      Now I'm just looking through my driving theory books and just spent about 5 hours lol trying to sort out gettin to cinema tomorro with Simon, u lot r a tricky bunch to organise but now it's sorted... now all I have 2 do is wait for it 2 go terribly wrong! So, I best be off coz I know what will happen...I will write loads more then will accidently delete it and be really pissed off! Check urself! Lauren xx
