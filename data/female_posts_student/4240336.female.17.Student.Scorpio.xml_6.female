Maybe that's just me though. I'm sure people will fight with me with this feeling. They'd just be like "that's how you're supposed to feel at 17"and all that bullshit. That's all my mom ever gives me. Like that day she decided to  lecture  me on life and crap. And how I have to do better in school. And then she went, "life isn't easy" so I just went "Whatever. I hate life then". I think I really do. I find no purpose. It's to feel like this till you're like...21 or 22, then probably feel like this again once you're outta college and can't find what to do with your life because you're life just failed you and you can't find a career that you've been looking for for years. So life really isn't that grand. I hate it already.
