I confessed to my biggest thrill of the nite is getting on to the computer and talking to people. Especially cool people! LOL. Then I annouced I had no friends really outside of church..I do. Just not people I go out with and stuff. See, im secure enough with myself to annouce this to the cyber world! Other than that church was great!! Awesome sermon by Dustin..very moving! I wore my cute tube sox and amy wore her matching ones!! :-) YAYA!!  I got a book from Randy to read,  it was The Bourne Identity. I think the best part of the nite was showing up all the guys on the court, c'mon guys you know i got game!! lol..RIGHT, i couldnt even dunk a donut...WOW, i shouldnt say that out loud!  Well guys hope you're weekend was great...more to come....hopefully!! :-D
