It was cool :) Well my week next week as far as I know (until I go work on Sat and check hours for week) is: Monday: working 9 - 12 being kingstore trained, then Pauls in afternoon Tuesday: having hair cut (yes cut cut short short, wel, short) Wednesday: possible work Thursday: possible work Friday: possible work I can't say for sure during the week until Sat. Sounds like a good idea anyway :)  Today and tomorrow I am out at the war and peace show so should be good. It appears I have done my back in somehow. Perhaps I fell over during the night because it hurts rather alot. Gah.  Have a cool day ya'll.
