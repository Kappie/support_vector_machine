I have so far survived 2 days of YMCA summer camp, mostly unscathed. It has been two days of confusion, messes, a bit of insanity, and a lot of kids. A lot of things are different this year from last year. The daily camp schedule, how it’s laid out, how the kids are grouped, and how the counselors and staff are scheduled is just a start. One of the big changes that may not last is that swimming has been relegated to one day a week for each age group. This has been a source of pretty major complaints from kids…and I think that the parents will chime in next via their kid’s opinions. We shall see how it goes.  So far our new camp director is hanging in there. He’s not a person who is a rule follower nor is he one of those people that are really very authoritarian. The result is someone who does not want to be in charge, and does not excel at it…being in charge.  It’s a little crazy to say the least. Most of my fellow counselors did not receive adequate training…and haven’t got a clue. All in all the experience has been nerve wracking. But, I have survived Day 2. One little link to my past…an old YMCA Day Camp friend of mine Naloni now brings her son to day camp. Scary. He’s 8 I think.  I feel so old sometimes.  More blogging news about blogs in my blog: (I cant resist the blogging paradox) Nike is going to be using blogs to promote their shoes. They will be dispersing little clips of artsy films to one of the larger blog engines. It should be interesting to see what happens with the “underground anti mainstream” culture that blogs embody when faced with voluntarily visiting a consumerism driven commercial blog. Nike’s statement about the promotional concept included the fact that they are targeting the bloggers for these ads and that they know it is a somewhat narrower audience but that they are a very important audience. Nice to know.  I also recently read about a project called Wizard People, Dear Reader by Brad Neely. This feature is his own personal darkly funny and adult oriented version of the soundtrack to Harry Potter I. He recorded his own dialog doing various voices and reinventing the characters. I read that Potter and Pals are transformed into pre-teen alcoholics, that quidditch takes on homoerotic overtones, and that it’s more or less downright funny. It’s been a reported hit at underground film festivals and various screenings around the country…The cool thing is it is available to download at www.illegal-art.org. So anyone can screen the soundtrack on CD simultaneously with their DVD of Harry Potter I. The funny thing  is that this soundtrack is likely not illegal. The files are just sound files, its still up to the viewer to supply the movie and the whole off the wall concept likely falls under spoof art. Of course Neely’s  not the first to pull a stunt like this with a movie – Woody Allen did something similar with What’s Up Tiger Lilly, and more recently Steve Odekirk did his own twist with Kung Pow Chicken. However, both of those movies used foreign and little known kung fu flicks. Neely may have re-invented a pastime and pop-art form that may be quite the fad for contemporary big hit movie fans.      Quick and Dirty Reviews:  The Company: Starring Neve Campbell (Party of 5 and Scream,) Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange and Tank Girl,) and James Franco (Spiderman I  II.) The story is about the Joffery Ballet Company in Chicago and features the life and times of an up and coming dancer. This movie was directed by Robert Altman of Gosford Park fame – I had high hopes.   Boy, were they ever doused.  This movie is big on filming dance on stage, and small on plot. It was difficult to tell the characters apart even at the end - we knew so little of them that they all blended in together. The time line was shaky, and so was the overall movie concept.   The Good: SOME of the dancing. There were moments that were nice, seemed authentic, and like it might be a real dance for the Joffery.  There were occasional funny moments. Occasional. Neve Campbell’s arm muscles were impressive…and hard to miss when she shoots a mediocre game of pool.  There was a wacky costumed dance in the final performances…and as it was planned throughout the movie it sounded really goofy…but when it all came together…it was kinda cool. Oh, and the high point of the movie was a New Year’s roast performed by the company.  The Bad: Ack!!! Some of the dancing was downright awful/elementary and not at all representative of the Jofferey Ballet Company. McDowell spends the movie playing the same action over and over and over again. His company director is way one dimensional. The worst NoNo is the lack of plot. Seriously. There is no plot resolution or outright goals or points of suspense nor do we understand what the point really is.  There is so little plot it is a challenge to review.  The Ugly: A few of the dance costumes were a little over the top ugly. Some of the dialogue is pretty heavy dancerese. This means that some people just might not get what the hell is happening. The script/movie was partly Neve’s Campbells idea and seems like a plug for her as a dancer more than anything else.  Overall: Don’t rent this. I recommend that you don’t see this - even if you love dance. If you liked Fame, Camp, or any other movie of a similar genre you might sit through this and critique the hell out of it…but I wouldn’t pay for it. Well I did…but I don’t suggest anyone else should!  Buckaroo Bonzai: 80’s Cult Sci Fi flick with a host of actors that are now more or less famous including: John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Goldblum, and Ellen Barkin. The concept is based around Buckaroo Bonzai – a half Japanese half American Neurosurgeon, Rock and Roll Star, and King Fu expert who is involved with a project to break through the dimensional barriers using a rocket propelled car with a little device called an oscillating overthruster. The success of this experiment threatens to cause intergalactic war. Buckaroo is a hugely popular figure in the world of this movie and has his bandmates for sidekicks and his own groupies as back up.    The Good:  Kind of fun, obscure, sci-fi flick that is worthy of a cult following. The 80’s era music that the band played was catchy as hell. The movie features aliens that are all named John, the inclusion of Orson Well’s War of the Worlds as a plot element in the script, and Jeff Goldblum dressed as a cowboy – need I say more?  The Bad:  Difficult to hear the dialogue at times…then super loud when it comes to sound effects. Of course the special effects and costumes are from the time period of the 80’s…and well…they are a step above Dr. Who and a step below Alien I. Somewhere imbetween. The plot had a few holes of genius and whatnot in it as well as a bizarre president character and white house staff. We don’t get the know most of the characters very well, and they are essential characters from the book of the same/similar title on which the movie is based.  The Ugly: The alien space ships. Ug. Hello…not even aerodynamic in the slightest.  Overall: A fun flick for that kind of sci fi cult movie genre. Totally a popcorn flick and the kind of movie that really could be another big hit if remade now (with a few tweaks.) There is a book, and I found it fairly hard to follow, the movie is pretty much more clear. Rent this if you can find it at your local video store…Rent it for a fun 80’s sci fi flash back. A good triple feature: Buckaroo Bonzai, the BBC version of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and Spaceballs.  That’s all the news for now, in fits of print – Mack
