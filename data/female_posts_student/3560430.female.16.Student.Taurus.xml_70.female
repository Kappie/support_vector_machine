I am having pie for dessert. This is pathetic. I should be eating all healthy and stuff but no, I'm eating pie. I least I'm eating fruit!  I get to go to the school today, i.e. the martial arts school. It'll be nice to work out with out the burning heat. I think I will like that. I figure it will be about two more weeks in the mix class then I will upgrade to the advanced class again. Well maybe three weeks. I'll do this week mix, and then... Never mind I may have to go advanced next week because I'm working at science world until 4:30, it takes about... Wow I'm going to have to haul my work out stuff around with me when I go to Science world on Tues/thurs or I won't be able to work out, and I really don't think that I should just stop for two weeks. This is going to be difficult. maybe I'll do tuesday, and then work out Friday... What ever I'll do what seems right.   Ho hum pies done I think I'll go and eat some breakfast now.   That is the last bit of sugare that I will eat for awhile... I say this now...
