I just got to thinking about R, the ex. Wondering how he's doing...wondering if he ever thinks of me...wondering if he will be with V forever. Why do I think of that? That is all completely out of my hands. Then I think to myself, "I really want to talk to him." But what answers do I want from him? What exactly is it that talking to him will do for me? I am not going to get myself caught up in this drama again. But I guess it's because I'm still asking myself questions. I never ever expected this from R, and I'm still in shock that it ever happened in the first place. I don't know whether or not forgiving him will help me get over him. I know I needed the time away from him...and I feel like calling him tonight. I don't know if that's the right or wrong thing to do, I just feel like dealing with this lately. I feel like I need to let this go in order to move on with my life. I don't know what to say to him...but I feel like I cannot harbor this animosity toward him.  I guess I'm gonna get in the shower and try to shake this off...but I sorta feel like talking to him. I am not ready to talk to him on a regular basis, but I feel like I should talk to him tonight. I really have nothing to say. I guess I'm still looking for the answers that he wasn't able to give me before. I don't know.  Things are going alright besides that. M and I decided that we're going to "hang out," whatever that means. I hope it involves being alone with him and lots of making out, yeah! He's away for the rest of the week, so I hope he calls me when he gets back. I don't want to talk too much about it, because it's all up in the air right now.  Off to the showers I go!
