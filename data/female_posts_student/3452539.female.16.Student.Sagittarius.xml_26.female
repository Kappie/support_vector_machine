I am turning up caffeine!  lol, my dad did not think that the jalapenos that I ate after my caffeine rush were a good idea.   Got woken up from "sleeping in" at 8:30 by Rob calling from Jen's phone. They want to hang out and work on Justin's car today. Hell yes. Hopefully I can make it out there since I am cleaning my room now. I cleaned it earlier too and got some of my mother's things back to her. Now I am trying to get more done so I at least have a bed again. Then I can begin to rearrange things. This would not be such a horrible process if I could just take it one step at a time. Arg. I will get there. I have done it once before, and I will do it again.   lol, all I could say when I got that call was, "You bastard, remind me to kick the shit outta you when we all hang out." Jen is looking forward to seeing that since she says I am about 1/4 his size lol. She believes that I can do it though ;-P.  Yeah yeah Tycho, I know you are probably sitting over there thinking about saying something about me being a pretty intimidating person :-P. I am learning. I hope that you had fun, and I look greatly forward to talking to you again :-D  Thank you to those from LiveJournal who commented, by the way.  Let us see here, I shoud probably get back to cleaning, especially since I have updated so much in Tycho's absence. I wonder if he'll take the time to read all of it. I am kinda scared about his reading of my last entry before this one. It was just one of those moods.   I am out of it now, can you tell? Please? C'mon! I am serious, I am all better! Why do you not believe me?  ::sniff::   Just messing around right there. I am not only out of the bad mood, I am in a pretty goofy one.   Okay, I am done now, seriously!   Have a good day y'all!  -J9
