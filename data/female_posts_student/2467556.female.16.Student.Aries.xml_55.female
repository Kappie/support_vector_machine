I picked up crossovers really fast and i can skate pretty well.   Second Day of skating: worked on skating backwards, Kendra helped me.  I'm getting there slowly.  Also i picked up my left crossover pretty fast considering that right is my best one.  3 Today's Skating (third day): SO FRICKIN AWESOME!!!!!!!!  First i was doing really well with the warm up skate and i didn't hve any problems with crossovers.  Still couldn't skate backwards.  But i found out that i can go really fast and do crossovers, yay for me.  The coolest part of the day, WE PLAYED HOCKEY.  And i wasn't that bad, considering that i've never really played with people my age(except Brittany), especially 6ft guys and i've only played with my brothers.  I was center for a little while and i almost scored a goal but then this stupid guy knocked me down.  So this kid that knocked me down, a freshman who thinks he's all big and bad at hockey, is all skating like he's all that and a bag of chips.....so i had this grudge against him for the rest of the game and i kinda went after him.  I took my stick and kinda hit him and he was all like "hey! you can't do that" and i was like "Do you see any refs?" and i skated off.  After that it was kinda like a rivalry.  I decided i needed a break to catch my breath so i wanted the next shift to go on, which was these 3 guys.  I'm like "Hey! Hey Guys!" because i don't know their names.  They weren't listening to me and it pissed me off, so i threw my stick down on the gym floor and said "HEY LISTEN TO ME!!!  GET UP GET ON THE ICE!!!!  NOWWWW!!!!!" and i threw my stick into the stomach of one of those guys and skated off, cussing.  The guy was all like "Ok! i'm going!".  Mrs. Brinkman was all laughing at me and was like "Are you ok?" and i'm like "I'm fine, i'm just really competitive".  She said she couldn't tell lol.  Then these stupid guys forget that there is now NO GOALIE to keep the other team from taking the win, at the time we're beating them 1-0.  So i have to take the goalie spot because no one else will.  So i run out there and realize i have no stick and there's that stupid freshman coming up fast.  It was almost like a movie because Nadia's all like "Mercer!" and throws me the stick, which i catch.  And this guy is coming and he tries to poke it over the line and it doesn't go, so i dive and place my stick in the way so the ball doesn't go over and make this WICKED AWESOME save with my legs flying in the air, just like Marty Turco.  Then this stupid freshman pushes the ball in but moves the post, which we all know is illegal and makes the goal invalid.  And he's all like "Yes i scored a goal!" and i'm like "Hell no you didn't!".  He protests and says that he did and i'm like "You moved the frickin' post and if you've ever watched hockey in your life, you know that makes the goal not count so therefore you did not frickin score a goal."  He continued to protest and so i chewed him out until he gave up and said it wasn't a goal.  Mrs. Brinkman was all like "You tell him!".  It was amusing.  I let in one goal and i started hitting my stick and banging it all over the place.......why? because it was that stupid freshman that scored on me!!!!!  Oh well, i made some other saves, but my first one was the best.  I've never played goalie in my life, but i wasn't bad at it.  I was all slashing with my stick at every player's legs that wasn't on my team, so awesome.  Oh man, but i totally screwed over my knees.....they're black and blue with scrapes all over.  I didn't have any pads to really dive with but i had to protect my goal!!!!  Thinking about pain wasn't an option!!!  So now i have to wrap my knee, take some Motrin and wear kneepads while looking like a nerd because we're playing outside and if i mess up my knee anymore, i'll probably dislocate it or something.  Hopefully, i'll be able play tomorrow.   Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: HE GOT A NEW JACKET!!!!!!!!  AND IT LOOKS GOOD ON HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Its a nice blue jacket and it matched his white shirt and everything was matching and was the correct color for his skincolor.....i was so proud of him.....and then Brittany pointed out that he was wearing white socks with blue slide on sandals!!!!!!  HE WAS SO CLOSE!!!!!  At least his sandals matched his outfit, you have to give him props for that.  Keep on Blonde kid, one day, your day of perfect fashion will come.    Ok thats it, new friend story tomorrow probably!  I am a hockey player!!!!! (lol britt, kendra, nadia), ~~~Taylor~~~
