I think I'm burned in the shoulders, it hurts. And my whole body feels crusty from soap and tap water. I need to shower. I have Incubus stuck in my head.   But hey, it was all right. Peter and Ellis showed up, which was a lovely surprise. So did some other people I wasn't expecting. Andrew and Charlie hung around for a bit. First real interaction with next year's anatomy class. If Nimo's in, it's going to be fantastic. Otherwise, I guess it's ok. There's Erum and Nige, still.   Oops, I have no earrings in.   I made showcase. That's a burden off my back, and now I can skip the Colburn recital. Yay.  I don't want to go to dinner tonight. I guess it's going to be all right, but I just don't want to stand around or be harrassed by the parents or be distracted. It's selfish of me, and I've complained too much already. It just doesn't seem real. Tomorrow I'm sitting in for my first AP of junior year. Tuesday will be the second. Am I ready? Can I do this? I pretty much assumed English wouldn't be so terrible, but I woke up this morning and thought, Lydia, who are you kidding? How can you assume like that? I would really like a 5. On all of the APs. Is that too much to ask? No, if I study right.  I really want to drive. I was in a rush this morning and Dad let me drive myself down to the lot, but then I chickened out and asked him to come. I know I can't just take the car anywhere before I get my license. Very tempted, though.  My Postal Service CD just materialized. Good. I'm tired. Maybe I'll shower. Or I'll just take a practice test and play PS loudly. I have an hour and a half left of freedom.
