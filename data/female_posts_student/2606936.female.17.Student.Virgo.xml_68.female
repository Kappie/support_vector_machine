However, I'd just like to ask if I am justified in this.   Forthe past few years, girls have been permitted to wear spaghetti strap shirts during practice,  under the condition  that they wear at least a sports bra with  full straps , if not a full tank top,  underneath it , and it doesn't display too much of the bra [pretty much anything besides the straps]....   and if boys have been allowed to wear this sort of outfittoo, when they cross-dress for humor on certain dress-up days and skit nights..... (which is when we have a theme like Tacky Day or soemthing and everyone dresses accordingly for prizes)   Is it fair for a parent to change the rules, in that now no one can wear spaghetti strap tops at all, "no girls OR boys".... and  then  say, "Well, I should take that back... sometimes on dress-up days you'll seethem [nodding at a boy]wearing those?"   Keep in mind that this is MARCHING BAND, not cheerleading,and we wear them for comfort, not to be sluts or whatever it is they expect. [Although if they were just banned totally in the first place, we could get over it easily, because there are other comfy tops out there we could live with.]   The problem is that she implied that it was okay if guys wore them to mock girls, but not if girls wore them for comfort. Which is absolutely ridiculous.   Wouldn't most anyone who is not an ADD pervert who spends a lot of time around men in tank tops, find a boy in a spaghetti-strap shirt much more distracting than a girl in one, especiallyduring a time when we're trying to get work done? It's a much less common and more disturbing sight, and it's also just gross. Girls inspaghetti-straps are a normal sight in the world of a teenager in summer, and it's not like any more skin is being revealed than in a normal tank top. In fact, if you want to measure exactly, MORE is covered than in a regular tank top, if you wear the sports bras.    vs    ?   Is one of them better or worse? I don't think so.  Plus,they just decided to tell us 3 days before camp, so now a lot of girls have had to shop for more appropriate clothes that they can march in without discomfort..... so those of us, also, who had planned in advance, are getting screwed over.   I am tempted like a mofo to call their bluff and go ahead and wear the Twin Day outfit that my friend and I have planned for over a month, which involves wearing a spaghetti-strap top over a sports bra. Since it's  on a dress-up day, for a costume , it does fall within the guidelines they laid out, and we'll be wearing the appropriate bras to cover ourselves up anyway. I kind of feel like we deserve to at least show them what's wrong with that rule, and I don't know who will have the gutsand debating skills, should a problem arise,to do it but me.   If boys can make fools of themselves in comfortable tops, then girls ought to be able to wear them when they're being serious. If you ban some of us, you ban all of us. I can almost hear the "boys will be boys" coming, and there is no way I will stand for it.   Do I sound more like a pissy teenage girl who wants more than she deserves,than someone who sees a fairly   silly   double standard emerging? I think I'm a little of both, and I wouldn't be angry if we hadn't already gotten outfits.   Still, they cannot do that and think it's fair. If the boys don't indulge in their little privelege, I'll accept it and sew the straps of the outfit, because then we're all equal.   But if I see any boys wearing them and getting away with it, you can bet I'll be doing the same thing,with a whole lot more modesty than they will. I'll make SURE I get away with it, too. I don't take kindly to being treated like a child by school officials or parents acting as a school representative, and I've usually always won in the past overstupid things like this.   And if I have to do it, I'll make sure I look damn good, too.
