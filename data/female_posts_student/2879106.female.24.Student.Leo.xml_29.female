We talked about everything that had been going on in our lives and for the first time in a long time I felt like I had my best friend back. I just love him so very much and I can't imagine not having him in my life.                Tomorrow is my last day at Lonestar for the summer. I am so excited!!!! I hope I make a lot of money so I can start to save for moving out on my own. After I am finished withmy night at Lonestar tomorrow I am going straight to Aleks. Then we are going to spend the night together and then we are going to spend all day Sunday together. I just can't wait. Well I will tell you more about all of that later.
