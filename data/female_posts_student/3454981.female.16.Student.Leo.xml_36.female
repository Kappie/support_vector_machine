I don't know why I titled this 'entry' like that, it sounded good though--like it has a bit of a ring to it. Anyway, I wanted to post this "fairy tale" that I've been writing. Mind you, it still doesn't even have proper punctuation or sentence structure and it still needs a lot of work (so don't laugh at me! I know it's stupid!) but I figured that typing it out would help me to process it and manage to keep it organized...I hope...so here it goes.  Once upon at time that was not so long ago, in a place not too far from the reaches of our imaginations there lived a small girl. She had been in world not much longer than five years, but was as every bit the wise for it. Everyday she would clean the house until five hours past the midday sun. While all the other children played games in the streets she would diligently attend to her duties. It didn't help that her family was elsewhere "making money" or playing cards. But despite these things she was always able to finish cleaning by the time the sun had been past the top of the sky for some time. It was at this very same time, before the market closed, that the little girl had to run errands and get the food for the next day. Now that you feel perfectly sorry for her and pity her, I must tell you that this has all been a fabulous pity party, and still the girl is none the better for it. She was actually a perfect brat and pitied herself even more for it. Yes, her family were jerks, but she was as well. That's the end of the story and don't you go asking where the fairies or the fairy godmother were--it's no use.     FINIS
