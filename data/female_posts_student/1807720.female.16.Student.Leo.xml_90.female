I went shopping for Christmas presents this morning and well when I got home I studied for chem for a while but like I said I couldn't concentrate so I am going to wait until later tonight when I can focus more.  I went to Britney's last night.  We haven't seen each other in almost a year and I got my like 4 month be-lated b-day present and we exchanged gifts.  She gave me a $25 gift certificate to South Centre and a $25 gift certificate to A  B Sound so yeah this moring I bought the Britney Spears Cd and I got these two sparkly shirts cause I love things that sparkle.  Ben and Melissa are coming for dinner tonight and I think the last episode of Survivor is on tonight.  I have to study for chem though.  I MUST do good, I NEED to do good, I HAVE to do good.  I hate always trying to hard and stuff and like average keeps dropping.  I want it to go up this time.  I can't even remember a time when my chem average actually went up.  I feel VERY stressed out right now just thinking about things.  Next week is going to be so difficult and stressful, but holidays are almost here.  I just have to hold on a little bit longer.
