Not really, but I'm trying a little reverse psychology on myself. I am looking forward to having a schedule, and having somewhere to be at specific times, as I don't really do the whole detached aimless thing too well.  Hopefully, this will make me better about blogging and not worse.  Though the next couple of weeks will be busy for me, with work, and class, and trying to get the writing competition papers read.  So we shall see.    It's a busy week coming up in other ways as well.  The new Harry Potter movie opens on Friday.  I'm contemplating a midnight showing in my neighborhood, but I don't know if I'll be up for it then.  In fact, considering my busy-ness, I should probably wait, as I probably will, as I detest crowds.  But then again, my curiousity and desire to see it might just get the better of me.    Also the Tonys are this weekend.  Only having seen two shows that are nominated for anything - and really, only two shows period - I do not have much of a stake in the outcome, but I am interested to watch nonetheless.    More fun with friends also promises to visit me soon!  So it will not all be boring books and slightly less boring work, so don't feel too sorry for me.  As I'm sure you won't...  And now, to get a good night's sleep, for once, to prepare for the busy day tomorrow.  Or perhaps I'll just watch the rest of the Lakers game, though if they win (as I'm sure they will) I'd be too depressed, so on second thought maybe I won't.    Until tomorrow...
