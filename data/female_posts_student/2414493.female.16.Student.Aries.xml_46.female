This week has basically been the type when you're out all day doing a whole bunch of assorted, mandatory things and you just don't have enough time to slow down and sleep and eat and be normal. But I shall be ok now, I think. It's Thursday and it's the last day of the week and I might as well be happy early, for I have four more days of happiness--at least, when happiness is defined by no school.  I wish I had something witty and observant to say, except now I've just realized that this week has been so devoid of that lovely empty time to think that I can't say anything lucid at the moment. I hope this fatigue isn't a disease. I'll be sitting in the back of journalism and it's not even noon and I'll tell J I'm tired already. Is it anemia? Some exotic deficiency?  So yes. Sitting here, I ponder about my excessive consumption of food today (overcompensation for lack of sleep?) and recount the contents of my stomach: Apple Jacks, a burrito, lo bo gao, a sandwich, juice, yogurt, Triscuit, two pieces of candy, a whole bottle of water...no wait, I'm not dysfunctional. I wish there was some good brainless TV fodder so I could perch on the couch and watch for a while. And looking at the YSP brochure for this year, just laugh that in a week I'll be flying solo to Sacramento.  The A situation (and now it sounds formal, damnit) seems like it was a while ago. I almost hate to think that just three days ago I was curious to go back to school to see how things turned out, and now I'm almost ambivalent and ready to explain anything, almost, in a level tone. It's just so difficult to connect the goofy kid who doesn't realize something's funny until two seconds after everyone else has finished laughing and the kid who treated me to one of the best times ever. But you know, I'm totally ok with that too. Erum's finally home, and she helped put things in perspective: it wasn't like I could force myself into liking him anyways and I'm just stuck on this still because it's never happened before. Valentine's Day is fast approaching, and I think I'm all right with that one too. I'll marvel at K's flowers and B's ring and J's necklace, but I'm glad I realize that maybe it's not my turn yet and I'm going to accept it. I'm not going to force myself into feeling pathetic and unloved, for the truth is, I'm happy when I'm around friends and that's probably all I can handle at this point given my crazy schedule.  But someone isn't ok with it. I saw S today, who is accused of being gay. I talked to T about it too, and she also wondered how she could attach herself with such immediacy to him and expect him to take her to the dance after talking to him in person twice. From my point of view, how could she dare expect such a thing? And she's going after (and here I leave a blank for her sake) now. I don't know what to say to her. Part of me wants to be the jealous teenage girl and withhold what I have of it from her. I am very tempted to be, for again, how could she embark on such a mission when she barely even talks to him? She's said many a time before that she's not happy about V-day. Ok, that's fine with me, but should she keep complaining about it? There are plenty of upstanding peers without significant others who are COMPLETELY FINE about not doing something romantic on Feb. 14. I just don't understand her sudden desire to get a guy. And I begin to wonder (and with unintentional malice) how she expects to get the guy when she doesn't even talk to them very much, when she always gets incredibly flustered and worried and just hasn't let loose yet?  But maybe I have to ask these things of myself, too.  I just hope that whoever has a date for Valentine's Day will enjoy themselves thoroughly, to feel that little bit of magic, the little bit of secret happiness that they'll look back on again and again.
