I've been trying to cut back on my online time lately. (If you can't tell.) Because I seem to get extremely upset when I'm online.  Whatever.   I'm better than how I force myself to feel .  If only I could always remember that...  Song:  I've come to my senses, That I've become senseless, I could give you lessons on how to ruin your friendships, Every last conviction, I smoked them all away, I drank my frustrations down the drain, out of the way, So I sit and wait and wonder, "Does anyone else feel like me?" Someone so tired of their routines and disappearing self-esteems,  [Chorus:] I'll sing along, Yeah with every emergency, Just sing along, I'm the king of catastrophies, I'm so far gone, That deep down inside I think it's fine by me, I'm my own worst enemy  I could be an expert on co-dependency, I could write the best book on underage tragedy, I've been spending my time at the local liquor store, I've been sleeping nightly on my best friends kitchen floor, So I sit and wait and wonder, "Does anyone else feel like me?" I'm so over-dosed on apathy and burnt out on sympathy.  [Chorus]  Let the meaning slip away Lost my faith in another day, Self deprication seems okay, I never thought I'd make it anyway  [Chorus]  I'm my own worst enemy [x5]  -The Science Of Selling Yourself Short- Less Than Jake
