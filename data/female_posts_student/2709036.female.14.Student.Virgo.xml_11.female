There are those who feel and have felt the same, have had to stand alone all their lives, yet they found ways to stand. They discoverd reasons to stand and omit facts of being loved by those who seem to not love them enough to support them in their hardest times. . .in their mental emotional struggles in becoming who they are to become, the person seen in the future, the person seen now.   There's Something There  I remember that time when you told me that you loved me and always would, during that time when I was confused. Now I'm here telling you the same. I love you and always will, no matter what crazy things happen between us or the wack things we may do to each other as time goes on. There is something about you that I love, don't feel as if you're the outcast and no one cares. . I surely do^_~. Plus, we all are freaks in each others eyes, with the wack things we do each day.   ['live and comprehend that you can't be like everyone else and a group of people the same, that would be a dull world to live in everyday of your life 'just as you speak of being there for me, i am here for you]
