A few I can't mention...actually, I can't mention most heh, but I  did get a good grade on my math test and I got out of periods 6, 7, and 8. I have 5th hour lunch too. :)  The assembly yesterday...ehhh....we sucked. We did really poorly. There's nothing else to really say about it honestly. It was interesting. Then, rehearsal wasn't bad at all for once. We had music checks during sectionals and I actually passed....  I was really worried about it to be honest. I know I know all of my music but I was afraid I'd make a dumb mistake and get in trouble for that but I didn't! YaY! And then...before the game, all the seniors were taking pictures and stuff, and so on the way there...I got to call out the 5, 6, 7, 8. It was exciting, hehe.   The game was pretty good and our show was going great at halftime but they had to cut out the last song because things ran over, and we didn't have enough time to finish. I felt kind of bad since it was the seniors' last night and their last chance to perform in front of everyone, but at least the first part of our show was good.   I got home around 11:00'ish went pretty much right to sleep and woke up at 6:30 for PSAT's. Wooohooo. It was fun times. I had to take it in a serperate place than everyone else, so I got to go at my own pace which was nice because I finished an hour early, and they just let me leave. I was like...sweet. I actually have some free time.  And...in an hour and a half, I have my hair appointment! :) YaY! I'm SO excited for homecoming...like...unbelievably excited. I think it will be really fun and I'm glad I'm going with Bryan.   Everything is going so well right now. I'm afraid to be saying that honestly...like...if I do everything will go back to sucking. Ah well. We'll see what happens. I really should get going. Quite a bit to do...
