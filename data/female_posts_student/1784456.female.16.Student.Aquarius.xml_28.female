Guess Izzy's gonna see this...(hehehe) Hmm at the moment I've got my brother blasting away on his guitar...he's recorded it so he can play the trumpet at the same time (Aargh!) Oh and our front door's wide open because my dad just painted the step (any one want to nick a tv?) Yeay! He broke the trumpet...well...our school's trumpet...Oh well. I walked into our kitchen and the kittens started to tear me to shreds! (We have three, and they love to be stroked) They're sooo cute though! When they're not scratching... Mmm I should have breakfast soon! My rabbit's running around our garden. We introduced her to one of our cats called Mango and it tried to bite her neck! So she's still a bit freaked but I guess they're just gonna have to work on their relationship. Our old cat Scamp used to get a bit annoyed by Agoutie (our rabbit) because she used to follow him around all the time! (Aww!) I'm getting kicked off now, guess any one reading this is as confused as me! Cleo, Brodie and Mango are the kittens, Agouties's my rabbit, Scamp and Pixie were our old cats but they passed away :(
