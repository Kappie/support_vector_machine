It's like you get to know these people and you become such good friends with them over a period of time and your so close, and it sucks that we all god to different school except Robyn, Cassie, Danny, and me. Most of them go to South, which I guess is better than West, so that's good? I dunno. But I'm going to miss all of them so much, especially Robyn, not that she goes to a different school and I can't see her whenever I want or anything, but I'm going to miss seeing her everyday. She and i were talking about that yesterday and we were all sad, and it was like golly goodness, it feels like we're breaking up. So then I made her laugh, for a long time in which she started coughing as usual, and there for thats when I laugh, not to be me or anything, all in good fun! Cassie, I will certainly miss her drama with Alisha and Morgan over TIM out of all things, Tim, I mean honestly. Nd Chelsea, who is just one of the weirdest people I know. And Derek, he is just such a good person, crazy and weird at times, but aren't we all. He is just one of those people that you can just sit and talk to. Most of the time it was about boys, and then he would keep bringing up Dustin, which was a little weird, but beggers can't be choosey...or something like that anyway. And then he graduates early to go into the Marnies. What is it with South boys and the Marines, honestly. Travis is just one of those kids you really can't like see yourself without a person like him in your life. He's just so carefree and careless, but not in the dumb way. He's also obsessed with the Marines. Kinda scary at times, but that's how he is, and that's the way you have to take him. Hadley, she is just an all around good kid, funnier than hell, but shes down. She was telling us the other day how the summer of 7thg rade she was at a party and wasn't watching her drink and some guy raped her and she got pregnant. And then she had and abortion. And then last summer or sometime last year she was dating this guy and she was on birth-control and she got pregnant again and then she found out he had been cheating on her for the last 3 months so she told her mom and got another abortion, but didn't tell the guy because he didn't deserve to know. I....agree? Andrew(Hagen) he's a cool kid, he's funny as hell though, and....the kid I shall miss the most, besides Jordy....the SMELLY KID, now he definetly does not smell bad, it's a good smell...believe me! His name is Andrew too, and let me tell ya he is a hunny. And seriously, oh my gosh he smells INCREDIBLE!! And all it is...Lucky. It smells very different when its not in a bottle at the Buckle or on Max. But, honestly...WOW! So he finally brought it to school and he randomly sprayed me, which I didn't mind cuz I smelled good. But people were all like you smell like a boy, who were you with. So I smile and point to him, in which casae they would all be like heyyyyyyyyyy and I'd smile and walk away, and he was close enough to hear, and would sit there and smile. It was rather amusing. I definetly wore a skirt today and Andrew( not the smelly one, Hagen) So we're all sitting on the "bench" which is definetly the consession stand area.... he tried to life up my skirt and I hit him upside the head. LOL, pretty hard too, which was by reaction. So during break people have issues with grabbing my legs and pulling me off of the counter....so Derek, being the ass that he is tries to several times and so im not really paying attention the last time cuz the smelly kid and I were laying our heads on each other, so Derek grabs my feet and pulls me...so I sqeak really loud, and throw my arms around Andrew's(smelly kid) shoulders and still get pulled off....bringing him with me. So then they all laughed while I'm almost having a heart attack, and I swear I was going to pass out, not that it was the horrible, it just scared the hell out of me, so Smelly kid is standing there like holding me, because I almost have a panic attack. And Nate sits there and looks at me like i have COMPLETELY lost my mind....so that's my story and I'm stickin to it.
