He was shaking his head so violently to the music I thought it might get detached from his neck. Jack Neo explained that he had to write these type of songs for him because Lee couldn't sing any other genres. I didn't even know he sings. He even did a little dance which showed off his grey boxer shorts. Neo went on stage a little while later to show his support too, they sang a couple of songs together and talked a little about how a Changi Prison cell looked like. One of the scenes in Neo's new movie 'The Best Bet' was filmed there. I think 5 out of the 6 songs in his CD was sung within the short half an hour. I wonder why would the audience still bother to pay 16 bucks(they gave a special discount of $2 today) to hear them all over again.   I didn't hang around to see how many people actually bought the CD just to get their autographs. I went to grab a burger for dinner. Only to learn after that that the fries I ate contained 47% fats. I really do have a healthy diet.
