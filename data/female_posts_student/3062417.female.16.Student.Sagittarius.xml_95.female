All I'll say is that it was some fun times because I don't want to explain everything. Then I went to jazz band and finally got home around 9.    Today - Was actually good. I missed Chemistry and Chem lab so I was happy. I had to play for the voting day thing. Then we played catch phrase in study hall! It was so much fun. Danielle, Jenny, and I are awesome catch phrasers right!? Lots of fun times in that study hall today. Then I stayed after school and chatted with Carol about the guy I like (kinda) and just hung out with everyone. Carol is convinced that this guy is perfect for me for some reason. (???) I don't even know if I like him. Then we played at the voting thing for jazz band. Then I talked to Carol on the phone for a little while when I got home and now I'm online.  Oh, and big news, I'm sitting first for wind ensemble for the rest of the year (?) because Erica is in the hospital. I feel bad for her because it's her senior year and all and it's gotta suck big time.  Thoughts: [I hate how people make little things seem like a big deal.] [Popcorn is a type of soda.] (catch phrase) Right Danielle? [A baby sheep is a LAMB not a FAWN.] (catch phrase)  No song for today because I'm on my mom's part of the computer so I'm not listening to anything right now.
