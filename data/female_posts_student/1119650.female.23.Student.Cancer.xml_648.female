Starting on a hill at a light with a manual transmission and someone pulls up thisclose behind you causing you to a) stall out or b) squeal your tires like its Dukes of Hazaard*  2.  Liars  3.  People who think they're better than they acutally are  4.  Rainy days (when its been raining for like 5 days in a row.  This is Connecticut, not Seattle)  5.  People who can't take a hint  6.  People who don't clean up after themselves  7.  Not having a sufficient amount of money  8.  Working at this job  9.  My 2 favorite pens dying on the same day  10.  The exorbited price of gyms  11.  Having to clean my room...again (I don't even really live there anymore)  12.  Living between 2 places and never having what you're looking for at that moment at the place you are right then  13.  Vacations ending  14.  Friends moving away  15.  Realizing how much time you've wasted being "responsible"  *   In fairness to me, I've only been driving my new car for like less than 6 hours total so its exepcted that I'm not gonna be *perfect* at driving it.  It just makes me aggrivated though.
