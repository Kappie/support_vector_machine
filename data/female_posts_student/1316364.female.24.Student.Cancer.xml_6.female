He needs  to be a soldier and not husband it's just I miss my husband dammit. I wish he was coming home already, but the fact is that he hasn't gotten overseas yet. Yesterday he told me that a bunch of people from his company were going to be sent to support other companies within his unit/battalion. It is a good possibility that Jesse will be one of the group that have to support the other companies. He said that they do not know where they are going to be stationed yet but that it has been confermed that one group will be stationed in Kuwait. I really hope Jesse windes up there. The minute we found out that he was being mobilized i hoped that he would go to Kuwait.   I just hope we find out soon where they are going to place him. I hate waiting.
