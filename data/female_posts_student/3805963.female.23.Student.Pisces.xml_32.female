The movie features one of Marvel's most malevolent bad guys, Doctor Octopus. It also revolves around the love story of Peter Parker with Mary Jane Watson. A lot of the movie focuses on Spiderman's inner struggle with his own dreams and his duty to being a superhero.   The special effects were really awesome, and on par with the former movie, and the fight scenes between Spiderman and Doctor Octopus are very intense, and features even more property damage than the Hobgoblin fights in the first movie. One of the coolest scenes was the fight on the subway train, very intense and very good special effects. The movie also features a comic relief in Peter Parkers current apartment and his interactions between the landlord.   The movie invokes a wide spectrum of emotion throughout the film, and does it with very good cinematography. if there is anything to complain about in the movie it would be the amount of times that Spidey is without his mask. He reveals himself to too many people in my opinion. A Superhero is supposed to mask his identity, and in the comics does so to a great extent, whereas in the movie he's practically revealing himself to everyone toward the end of the movie.   All in all I recommend seeing this movie, it was very well done, and besides the slight annoyance by the amount of times spidey reveals who he is to people, there is nothing else to dislike about this movie. I give it 5/5 stars, and is a must see movie.
