I wish I could swim!!! hahaha This I really did try but the instructor was like SO scary that I eventually just gave up learning! hahah I can float though..  I wish I had the power turn invisible. Not because I want to find out about the private lives of others or what people think of me. Don't worry- I don't want to rob a bank either! Its just that it would be really nice to be all by myself at times without people looking for me or bugging me..hahaha  I wish I had the stamina to run forever! I love the feel of the wind blowing against my face and I love running simply because it can be an endless activity. The only thing that is stopping me is the exhaustion and panting...hahahah  I really would love to learn sign language. I believe that sign language would open the doors to a whole new world that I presently can't appreciate or truly understand. It's something that I have dreamt of learning since very young but have not found the time or a good course that suits me. But I definitely will learn it in the future :)  I wish there were more than 24 hours in each day! I wish there was no disease or illness in the world. I wish everyone would be happy. I wish there would be no poverty. I wish there would be no one dying of hunger or thirst.   BUT if all this were to happen, the world will not be the place it is now! It will be very dull with no challenges. It will be too perfect for humans. There would be nothing to work towards or work for. So I guess deep down, I would rather everything be just the way it is now!!!
