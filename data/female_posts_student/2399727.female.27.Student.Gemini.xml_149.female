They should throw the word "intensive" into all summer course titles I think.  When I took Beginner's Intensive German a few summers ago, I thoroughly appreciated the "intensive" part so I knew what was coming.  We have to be subjects in four experiments for this course as our participation mark.  I wonder what mental probing they will do to us.  It's going to be a busy summer.  I watched a comedian on  Comedy Now!  last night.  Her name was  urlLink Nikki Payne , and she told the tale of growing up in the Maritimes in a trailer park with a lisp.  Talk about a triple whammy. :-)  Well, Nikki did this bit about wanting to lose some weight.  She said she went to her doctor and got some diet pills, but she noticed on the label that one of the side effects was "anal leakage."  At this point she starts to giggle nervously and announces to the room, "I look great but I smell like shit!"  I laughed so hard I almost fell out of bed.   urlLink    Nikki Payne urlLink     More to come...
