For some reason I can't except the fact that he is gone and that I have to move on with my life. I broke down tonight. While all those "perfect people" watched me express my darkest moment.  Luckily somebody actually understood. Somebody not to stuck up to help out a friend somebody actually cared for once and I never had to give anything  in return for the favor (but I do owe that person).If it wasn't for that person I probably would still be there, in my little world with my head up in the clouds to messed up to realize that somebody actually cares. That person made me realize that no matter what I will always have him and other people. As corny as this sounds it's true.  So thank you so much for helping me out. I owe you big time and I love you lots though I rejected your attempts to make me happy the first few times you didn't give up. So thank you again.
