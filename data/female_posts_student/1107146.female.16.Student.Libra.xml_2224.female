They aren't numbers like they are everywhere else. But that was definitely not the point of this post. The point was did anyone else get their AP test scores?  I got a 4 in everything (US History, Psychology, and English) so I'm fairly happy. It'll get me out of classes just about anywhere I go to school, which is really all I care about. Kind of nice since I didn't bother studying for any of them for more than an hour. Oops...
