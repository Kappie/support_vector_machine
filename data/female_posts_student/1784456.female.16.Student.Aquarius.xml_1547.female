At least I haven't got the freaky eye thing when you can't concentrate on anything and your eyes wonder everywhere! Yeah, I freak people out when I do that and try to talk to them! *but the walls are sooo interesting!* Ahh I need a new head... *optional donations of pink matter are ... optional* If you had a chance to 'choose' your kid, then would you? Wouldn't that be like expecting them to be like something without even knowing them, I would hate to live in that society! Every one would expect you to look pretty and get good grades, they'd expect that from everyone. And what if because of your environment you were a failure? Would your parents have a right to blame you and punish you? Ahh, don't you just hate 'the west' sometimes too?
