Ross has this thing with him that well is his own and I do not have a right to publish, but he is fine and feeling better now. It was my first time in ER in years, last time I don't even remember it.  A lot of old people, alot of waiting.  Wouldn't suggest it, but he was gonna drive himself and well I do not think he could even resite the alphabet let alone drive himself there with no supporting friend.  But I would like to say that I started this blog, and my others, because sometimes I believe I actually have something interesting to say.  To me this is nothing really personal, it is things that I would tell a friend.  My away messages get to involved and well they cut me short so I started this blog so that I could ramble on about my day, people and politics.  Also wanted a place where people could find out about me, and where I could share with my friends pictures and moments of life.  Sometimes I even find a good website to share with you.  But I think most peoples' fears are the fear of being forgotten and of expiring and no one having taken a notice to them.  Everyone wants to be heard and everyone wants what they feel and who they were to some way be remembered.  I think in person I am mostly quiet, it is easier for me to write and do my art which I enjoy.  My Art and actual Writings stay private, but this is so I can rant and maybe someone will agree with me, or take interest.  I wanted to share myself so here it is, a blog.... so blog yourself silly world!  urlLink
