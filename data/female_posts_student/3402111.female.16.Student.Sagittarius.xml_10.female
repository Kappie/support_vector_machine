And I got to see them all today which was great. I had missed them so much.   So at the moment I am great, which I am sure you wanted to know.... I get a hair cut tomorrow too! Sounds kinda strange, but I look forward to hair cuts for some reason... dunno why.   I never realized how much I like to be the center of attention. It is horrible. People will be talking and I will always interject so the conversation turns back to me. Or I try to be good and quiet and that turns the attention back to me, still. I feel bad about that. And it has gotten worse over the past few weeks. I hope that this journal will help.... because all I do in here is talk about myself... me, me, me.  Jasper is great. He is Liz's dog. He is incredibly good mannered and well-behaved. When I first got there, he didn't jump or get over excited. I'm happy he is such a good dog and has such good owners. Okay... i go now
