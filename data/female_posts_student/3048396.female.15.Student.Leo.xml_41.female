It looks so empty in there! Oh and I counted all the pictures I had on my wall. 307. I had 307 pictures on my wall. Woo! Yeah...I read the newsletter today. Last one of Howards. I cried. *sigh* Im really gonna miss him. He helped me thru so much...and gives me so much crap bout Ross. *sigh* Im glad he confirmed me. July 18th will just really be a sad Sunday for me. Mom and I will be bawling our eyes out by the end. *sigh* On to happier issues. My Grandpa came home from the hospital today. Hes doin great! I think he was happy to be home and that made him feel better. Im glad hes doing good...cuz I dunno what I woulda done if something happened to him. So yeah we went over and saw him after supper. Before supper Kim came over and we talked and did some stuff on the computer...Then after supper Mom and I went on our walk and Jeff and Nathan went by on their mopeds and Nathan yelled "I can't take my eyes off of you!" Eh. Hes crazy. *Shakes head* Then round 8 I went over to Kims and we watched How To Deal...again. For like the hundreth time. We quoted almost the whole thing.  And theres just this one scene that really makes me think of Ross. *sigh* I miss him soo much! I really wanna see him soon. But im not going to. :'( *sigh* So then I came home and I sat on the computer until now...I think my Dads gonna kick me off soon. Eh like this is late! Half the time im online till 3. Gur. Hes annoying sometimes. *sigh* Well I better head off now...  Tara   Current Music:  none  Current Mood:  emotional  Quote of the Day:  "Kim, your cans are hard!" LOL
