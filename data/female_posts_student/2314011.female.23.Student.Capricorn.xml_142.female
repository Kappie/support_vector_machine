But, that means I can do a blog entry while I'm here instead.  Yay!  I must tell the story of the shelf-peg.  It's classic.    Went to my cupboard earlier in the week, at the end of a long, tiring day, for some soothing tea to find my middle shelf slumped back.  Thinking it time to flip the shelf over to counter-act the apparent warp, I unloaded the shelf and examined the pegs holding it up.  Ah-Ha!  One of said plastic pegs had given up the fight and defected to the bottom of the cupboard, leaving the peg-part of the peg nestled nicely in its hole-home.  Not in any position to devote any energy to any particular reaction, I instead replaced the board on the three remaining pegs and carefully placed light items upon it.  Tea bags here, graham crackers there.  Soup cans and microwave popcorn relocated to the upper and lower shelves.    Made to Moscow Building Supply a couple days later after a light day of class and before the 80+ pages of Civil Procedure project was to be tackled.  I was sure to bring the peg at issue along to be sure I purchased the right size.  Only when I'm faced with a myriad of plastic pegs of various sizes, no other time, do I realize the one section of the peg I need to gauge the size to be purchased is the one in the hole back home.  Still refusing to give in to any emotional reaction, I calmly pick from the range of sizes I feel pretty certain will fit.  4 of this size (because I may as well prepare for the others to give way, right?), 4 of that and 2 of the more expensive ones.  They're too big, anyway, so I'm not going to buy 4 I know I'm not going to use.  Better to get 8 that will probably work.  Sure enough, the 8 were too small.  And the two too big ones fit perfectly.  Again, not even going to worry about it.  I can take them back and recoup my $2.32.  Not a big deal.  Now I just have to set about getting this remainder-peg out of this hole.    It should be noted at this juncture that I am a very bad lesbian.  I need to go through a remedial course on basic lesbian-isms.  Just as an elementary but very illustrative example:  when my toilet clogs, I call the landlord and have them send a plumber.  Oh, I  say  I've tried plunging, but I haven't.  I think I  could  check my oil if it came to that, but I've never tested that hypothesis.  The only tool I have in my apartment is a hammer.  No nails, no screws, no screwdrivers.  Just a hammer.  So, with this background, let's proceed.  I head to the peg with the nail clipper, file at the ready.  It's small; it's thin; it's all I have that will work in this situation.  And so, I begin picking, pulling, scraping, pushing at this angle and that, to (shockingly enough) little avail.  Soon, I employ the steak knife's help, merely as a stronger force with which to bed this mere stump of plastic to my will.  Then, I realize:  the clipper might be used as a clamp-device and I can perhaps  pull   the stump out.  Indeed, such a plot would work, were it not for the sharp edges of the clipper.  It does pull the material quite a ways forward, but inevitably cuts through the weak plastic, leaving me in no better position.  After more than a few minutes of rearranging myself on the countertop and continued benign attempts at finding the right combination of leverage, pressure and pulling actions, I begin realizing I may have to explore other shelf-placement options.  Could have it a bit lower or a bit higher.  Stopped a couple of different times to seriously think about these options and always come to the same conclusion:  I want the middle.    Eventually, I stop to eat.  It's been five hours since my last meal and roughly one hour since this adventure began.  Hands are starting to shake and I'm beginning to take the whole thing personally.  The bagel and apple helped and I began round two anew.  With similar results.  Decide to call Joe to see if he has any tweezers (because I don't even have any fucking tweezers).  He has none, but suggests a corkscrew.  Why not?  Sure, it's a bit large for the area at issue, but who the hell cares at this point?  It was working at breaking the stump into a more workable slab of plastic, but the scraps of surrounding wood-work it was taking out of the cupboard panel made me nervous.  Yes, the area  around   the hole seems to be getting gradually larger, while the hole itself remains fit snugly around the peg.  The knife makes a few more appearances and the clipper is thrown down in frustration thrice, each time with the intention of never picking it up again because, really, it's time to just figure out another level for this shelf.  But as soon as I start thinking about it seriously, the more I refuse to let this fucker win.  If I have to cut it down, bit by bit, with the clipper, so be it.  If it takes all night, so be it.  And with cold, lonely resolution, I attack again.    During a typical, identical-to-all-its-predecessors, round, holding my breath to prevent the clipper from cutting all the way through the plastic (because that helps) as I pulled it forward, the stump popped out.  And few things, accomplishments, victories, etc. have felt sweeter.    I celebrated by washing the honey stains off the shelf and making completely unnecessary trips into the cupboard for the rest of the night.    Brought Sadie over for lunch today just to show her.    And now, I will run to the Building Supply store to return the unused pegs, go home and read Civil Procedure.  Happy Friday to me...and to you.
