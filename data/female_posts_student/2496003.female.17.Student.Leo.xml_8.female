Got to wake up early to go open a checking account (with the bling bling my grandma sent me ... who knew I could feel such love for her?) and then spent the day with my mommy in Gettysburg.  She even let me drive for most of the day, even though I almost got us hit by two cars.  My bad ... I really should learn to look both ways before I move the car.  She bought me more clothes, from GAP, which is one of my favorite places now because there's an uber hot guy working there who purposely came over to the register that I was getting rung up at (by the gay guy who makes my day every time I'm in there) just to look.  I've decided that deep purplish-red is my new color.  Which means I'm finally adding some color to my pretty much all-black wardrobe.  Then we went to Perkins and she brought me home, stuffed full of chicken and cheesesticks, only to have Ashley call me.  So Ashley and I went out.      I wasn't exactly sure what Ashley and I were going to go do, but we ended up at Barnes  Noble looking for books and magazines about prostitution.  No luck, and that apalls me.  Thoroughly.  So we gave up and went to the coffeeshop, and the adventure began.  I saw my friend Duncan from the RaggedEdge (the coffeeshop in Gettysburg that sadly burned down).  And we started talking and he hung out with us all night.  Definitely was cool enough to get himself invited to my Meteor Shower Party!  I think I might have offended his friends a little, one by calling the guy in black gay, and two by staring blatantly at them.  I had nowhere else to look, I swear!  Haha, yeah right.  I was just staring at the hot guy in the blue shirt who apparently is a bit of a pretentious snob.  Nothing new for me ... snobs are the best ones to fuck with.      But this must end here ... I've got some packing to do before tomorrow (going to see my sister is Pittsburgh, I'll be back on Sunday, I promise).  I love you all, my babies.  : )      With all my loving (and badly aimed) Gaydar,   Your Sweetest b.
