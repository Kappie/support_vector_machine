I keep getting these sparks that say “HEY ASSHOLE, BE NICE FOR ONCE!” I’ve never been able to though, and it hurts. Sometimes I wish everyone would go away and leave me alone. Lane, Ginny, Boots, Noodle, Dave,  EVERYONE . I wish I could move away and start all over, and be that friendless girl who goes out of her way to assist the people who pick on her. I may not have any friends that way, but at least it wouldn’t be from the fact that I’m mean.  I hate being mean. I get a lot of respect that way. People fear me. And the people who don’t fear me and still manage to become my friends won’t open up to me. Some friends I have. They can’t talk to me about how they feel. And all I do is cry over it. I’m so weak. Everyone hates me. Some just do a damn good job of covering it up.  I’m starting to doubt my friendships. I don’t think they really even exist any more, and they’ve just become facades to keep from hurting my feelings.  I want to break up with Dave. I’m hurting him, I can tell. He won’t admit it though. He doesn’t want to hurt my feelings. I don’t even know why he cares. Nobody else does.  I’m such a liar. I lie to everyone. It’s become a habit. I don’t blame anyone for not believing what I say. Why would anyone care what a liar says? I even lie to myself. It disgusts me.  I want to dies. I want to stop hurting others. Especially my little brother. Oh, how he  hates  me! He’d throw a party commemorating my death and all of my “friends” would attend. I suppose that being a gifted middle class child means I have real potential, but I’ll never live up to it. I might as well just die.  I wish I could cut myself. But I’m a weenie, so I can’t. I pulled a muscle in my thigh the other day. It hurts when I walk on it. So I walk on it. I pinch it and poke it and hit it. It feels so good. But it’s not enough. I’m still waiting for that thunderstorm to strike down the tree that falls over and kills me. No one will miss me in the long run. Once my friends marry, their memories of me will disappear.  I can’t stop the pain. The tears won’t cease from flowing. I cried last night for two hours. And I’m not talking about moping around and tearing. I cried. But of course I had music on so no one could hear me. I want to be left alone. I’ve never felt this kind of pain before. Not even when I went to the hospital last Memorial Day weekend. That wasn’t real pain. But this is.  I have so many regrets. They outnumber the things I don’t regret. Life has lost its luster. I have no purpose any more. I’m perfectly expendable. My friends can get new friends. My boyfriend can go back to that girl in New Jersey. My family won’t miss one member.   Told someone not too long ago that I found happiness in the experiences with my friends. But they don’t find happiness there. So the experiences are meaningless now. I have to find a new way to become happy. Somehow I don’t think it will happen.  I want to bleed, but my heart is so cold that blood doesn’t even flow through my veins. If I cut myself, thick black tar would ooze out. The mirror shrivels up in disgust with one look at me. It eyes me with impending regret.  I laugh at myself. Even though I have a heart of stone, I call myself soft. It makes my hysterical.  Are these feelings real? No. I don’t love anyone. Not even Dave. I’m living a lie. I’m such a liar. But he doesn’t love me either. If he did, he would tell me what’s bothering him when I ask him, not hours later in a faceless email. If he loved me, he would defend me in a fight if he supported my side. But instead he takes the luxury of standing back and watching while my world rips me to shreds for thinking independently like a rotweiler rips up a baby squirrel. He doesn’t love me, and I don’t love him. But of course I can’t say that to his face. I’m weak like that. Besides, if he can’t tell me how he feels, why should I?  I just wish everyone would go away...   Current Mood:  Cold
