But if you like Guns at all, or if you even just have access to "Appetite," I think you should go listen to "Rocket Queen" RIGHT NOW.  Anyhow, this isn't a Guns blog... it's a nothing blog.  But not in an annoying "Oh, let me be just like Seinfeld" kind of way.. just in a "not committing to a theme" kind of way.  See?
