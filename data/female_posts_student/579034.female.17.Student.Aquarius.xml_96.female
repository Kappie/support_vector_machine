More then sad, more then something that makes me proud of my faith and deffinitly not something that would make me hate Jews. I mean, yeah I'll still joke about how they killed Him and all but I mean, they really only played a small part. In then end, it was everyone. The scourging scence I couldn't watch. I covered my eyes for the most part. The parts that got to me most were the parts with Mary. You could just see the anguish in her eyes and it made you feel for her, like you were her, watching your son go through all that pain. I mean, how do you do that? Wether what He was who He says He was (and as a Catholic I firmly beleive he was), how do you watch your son being beaten and wipped and have his skin ripped off, then have to watch him carry a cross and die on it. Those were hard scens too.... at one point I just like grabbed Mike's arm I just hadda hold onto something. It was just very powerful and I felt like comming home and saying a Rosary or something.  I think it was all in all a very good, and, as I've said, powerful movie. I like couldn't take my eyes off the screen, well execpt at certain parts. Like, watchin Simon help Him carry His cross, watchin the woman wipe His face, watching the Romans beat Him, watchin Him gettin nailed to the cross was just something that makes me proud to be a Catholic ya know? It's like, I think that from now on, when they are teaching about the Stations of the Cross and about His Ressurection they are going to show that movie. It is deffinitly going to go down in history in some way shape or form. There are really no words to describe the impact I feel. I know it's kinda weird and all, to be so effected by a movie but this was just so... powerful lol. Like, you read about it, take tests about it, learn it and know it by heart but you never really like... are truly able to experiance it... and now... you are. As to the whole "Anti-Semitism" thing I think thats just retarded. I mean, if you hate Jews this is only going to highten your hatred but I mean if you never cared before you wont care now. Like I said, in the end it was everyone. I really think everyone should see that movie. No bout-a-doubt it.  x0x0x0x
