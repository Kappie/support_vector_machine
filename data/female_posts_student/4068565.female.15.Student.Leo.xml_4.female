Mom got me up around 9 when she left for work...so I laid around until about 11 and decided I needed to get up and do stuff. So I did nothing for quite awhile...mom left for  the hospital around 12...and I sat here alone all day long. I went crazy...I watched the ending of my favorite movie...so I was bawling when the phone rang. It was Deb calling bout babysitting Sunday. Then I hang up and watch the rest of the movie and cry some more and than I got a call from my favorite person. It was good...but I ended up crying after he left. So I sat here some more...decided to do something half way constructive so I  worked on the dance and then colored. It was something to pass the time. So then dad came home and we ordered a pizza...round 7ish everything started looking up. Arik called and said he could come! I was sooo excited. And I really hoped my parents would say yes...then my mom got home around 8...I couldnt ask right away she was telling us more -good- news! My Grandpa looks the best he has in a long time...hes walking good and thinking better. Wow. Unbelievable how life can change so fast. So I walked up to my mom slowly with a huge smile on my face and asked her. She said....."I already said he could come..." yay! I think I flew...lol Im sooo excited and soo happy. Wow. I keep getting this wonderful feeling in my stomach....*sigh* Im so happy. Life treats you right sometimes doesnt it? Once again....life goes on...I got thru some ruff days...and await the good to come...*sigh* Can't wait! Well im out for the night....  Friday the 13th is good...not bad!  -Tara
