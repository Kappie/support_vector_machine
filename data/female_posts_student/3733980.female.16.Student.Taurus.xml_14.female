For all of you who are wondering why in the world I would want or get a petticoat, it is for my Mesquite Symphony Guild Debutante Cotillion Ball. I get to wear this AWESOME all-white outfit and  urlLink waltz  with my dad (and my date, LORD be willing I should have one) and it's gonna be soooo awesome! What a blessing! Now that the petticoat came in, I have all the required items:     Big white dress   White opera gloves   White ballet slippers   Hose, etc etc etc   White petticoat    Isn't that exicting?! Well, I don't have any hair pieces yet... not have my dress straps been altered to fit, but I have the main items, like, totally down! And that's coolness! I am glad of that. Very. ^_^  Let's see... um... stayed up talking to some friends, as usual, and discovered how I can avoid bringing my entire CD collection downstairs with me to my computer room if I want to hear  urlLink some   urlLink of   urlLink my   urlLink music : windows media player's "copy from a CD" option. Brilliant. Praise God. So along with making backups of every single one of my CD's in CD form, I shall back them all up on my computer as well! Not putting all my eggs in one basket  tends  to be a wise thing.  Mom and Dad went to 3rd Saturday; turns out Mike's flight home from Ohio doesn't actually arrive until 4pm, so we have some time. ^_^ Um... So I just woke up a little bit ago and OH! In case you were wondering why the title of this entry is the title that it is, ( Pyjamas and a Petticoat ) that is because I had to make sure that the petticoat fit properly and, hey, I'm wearing pyjamas. Not usually will I disclose or divulge my current attire, but this was relevent to the message, no? YES.  So that's about all that's going on around here. I'll probably try to read as much of The Agony as possible w/o getting too too carsick and of course read da Bible no matter how carsick I get and OOH! I get to help with Elizabeth's 7/8-year-old class up at the church tonight! I get to do a skit and hang out with the precious little darlings and (more than anything) I get to talk to them about  urlLink JESUS!  Now  that  is about enough to totally make my day.   Yep yep. Soon I shall send this out to all of my family and friends to read. :) Until then, just  urlLink e-mail me, man . ;P
