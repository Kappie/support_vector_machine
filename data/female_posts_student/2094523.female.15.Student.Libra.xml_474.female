I could barely sleep last night and kept waking up to be freezing cold. oh well on a good side note i'm damn gorgeous. ba ha! but how come i can't get anyone even if i tried?... beats me. I should be studying my music history and stuff coz i haven't all day but i feel really cruddy right now so that shit will have to wait. the exam is 2morow to those that don't know. im not that worried.. well if i was i'd be off my ass by now and i'm not so.. shows how much I care. I miss everyone that is out of town right now because by the time they get back I will be out of town and I haven't even seen them for most of this summer. just our luck. Don't tell me things I don't need to hear. don't tell me things I don't want to hear. Coz as far as I know I live in my own damn world and everything goes my way.  Sometimes i get really jealous.. what can i say I'm a jealous person. I envy probably the people that least expect it. ehh.. lifes not fair. i want my own Luscious I don't even knwo why I care so much Maybe I don't It's always just a freaking infatuation anyways Damn it all.
