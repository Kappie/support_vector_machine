This name makes you think of   RYAN:   JOCK boy. the jerk type who makes out with random cheerleaders by his locker EVERYDAY and occasionally with the not-so-gorgeous nerds, just to torment them. he gets away with EVERYTHING though, just because he looks like OHMYGOSH!! HAYDEN CHRISTIANSEN.   ALEX:  sporty guy with a goofy grin. he is tall and lanky and most definitely a redhead. his skin is permanently pink. he's really good at running, although he flaps his arms too much and looks like a chicken when he does.   TIFFANY:   exotic girl with her hair in cornrows. she's the funky hiphop type, she's into breakdancing, dj-ing and grafitti art and she beats the boys at it all. she LOVES bar top dances.   PAUL:   the boy in the corner, gazing out of the window during class, he stands up occasionally to make inspirational speeches which are mostly irrelevant to anything that is being discussed, but he gets away with it.    ABBY:  goth-ish grunge girl, dressed in vintage black. she loves drama with a passion. she is often seen with a camera and she goes around filming people in the hallways. she tints all her short-films purple though, because it's prettier that way.    PHIL:  guy in a tight t-shirt and feminine cut jeans, and that versace bag. he is not gay, he just has a horrible sense of fashion and tries to be everything, punk rock, emo, vintage all at once. he waves his hands about too much and oh yeah, and he just LOVES giving girls fashion tips.    SALLY:  surfer chick! long, straight, silky dark brown hair accompanied by streaks of light brown. she does 100 sit-ups a day and has very nice, firm abs.   DERRICK:   boy in too-big-pants and a backward baseball cap who watches MTV too much for his own good ("i'm just chilling, man!"). he never hears what you say because he's always plugged into his CD player, grooving to ludacris or missy elliot. he starts every single sentence with "y'all" and ends it with "dude" or "man".   ALLEN:  androgynous pretty boy. he looks like a fairy, and has dark haunted smoky eyes and full girly lips. the girls adore him, and he could pass off as a model. but he never really belongs anywhere.   JODIE:  5 foot 11. gorgeous. black hair and green eyes. model type. totally.   SAM:  loud nihilistic girl who is pro-anarchy. she's a rebel and a non-conformist, and sometimes tries to hard in the process.    MICHELLE:  preppy, AVRIL LAVIGNE worshipper.   JESSICA:   blonde cheerleader captain with that jock boyfriend and that huge clique of admiring girl pals. she ALWAYS needs a manicure, or a pedicure (they are like therapeutic!). she is the miss popular type, everyone can't help but loveeee. her  dream is to be on the cover of Seventeen and get voted prom queen.    LEAH:  child-like girl with her blonde hair tied in plaits. you can almost see her mind wandering off to make believe land.    ERIK:  hippie boy. he wears tie dye (homemade) and has long straggly hair, pulled back from his face by a sweaty headband. he kisses trees and holds candlelight vigils in times square. the boy believes in peace, love, hope, joy.   BILLY:  the type of guy who is ALWAYS sweating from his armpits. he's a little momma's boy and dresses in white collared shirts and Sesame Street ties. his socks are nearly knee high, his shirt is tucked all the way in, and his pant's are pulled up to his bellybutton by suspenders. he's not very bright either, and doesn't get any of the jokes people say. he's quite a sad little thing. his parents own a farm.   JOSHUA:  typical slacker boy (i would have said JOCK. if his name was josh. but well joshua is a different thing all together). he doesn't care what people think of him REALLY. he just hangs in the garage and plays the electric guitar. he wears whatever comes out of the laundry (if he bothers to even change) usually its the same nirvana shirt, torn up jeans, grunge sneakers assemble. even his hair is naturally messed up. of course, he begins every sentence with "like", and EVERYTHING he says even the most direct statements , sounds like a question. ("like, he was here today? and like, i saw him?")   BRITNEY:   annoying little sister of a head cheerleader (see JESSICA). probably a ten year old, who is as blonde as her sister. she wears her hair in pigtails and lovessss picking up the extension to whine while big sis jess is on the phone mushytalking with her boyfriend. an aspiring teenybopper star, who just adoresadoresADORES dreamstreet.   CHRIS:  spiky hair and sunglasses, he has barbie doll eyes and plucked eyebrows. he lounges about in his convertible in too-tight sleeveless tops and leopard print leather pants. he's perfectly straight though, in fact he's a playboy and he changes girls like he switches rhinestone earings.   MARIO:  three words: Gay Italian Fashionista   BRANDON:   a poet, a writer, an artist, a singer...and very pretty on top of that.   Hahaha i guess i got REALLY carried away describing people. but its fun! and it boosts your creativity :D * beams *
