If you haven't had time to get caught up, others here include Kuronue (some anime), Colonel Jack O'Neill (Stargate), Captain Jack(three extra characters here) Sparrow (POTC), and me, Sarah Anderson (Stargate fanficdom).  A noose? A noose?! Hah! You're afraid of dying once! When I go on "buisiness trips", I have to worry about dying several times, which the good colonel here can attest to.  Okay, thanks for that understanding, captain. I suppose we could get to a point without so much negativity between us.  Lemme point somethin' out, Cpt. Sparrow: I was interpreting someone else's message to Jack. And, by the way, she says peanut butter's better than rum, beer, or chocolate. ...Humph. Now, how could any alcoholic beverage   help   with "the whole cancer thing"?
