At this point in my life (well today and the past week or so) I have been  Very  happy, which for me is strange. I think I would have had to start this out a while back for you to have known that, well lets just say I can get very depressed, it's more of feeling sorry for myself, ha. Any way, the main reason I am happy at the moment is because of a girl I meet online. Yes a girl, and I am a girl, yes I know, well if you knew me better you would know that I'm bisexual. Anyway, continuing...I meet her on a website I had been visiting for about a year, and we just began to talk about everything. Soon I found myself falling for her, and I thought 'Sure I may like her, but she may think I'm an Idiot for falling for someone I have never meet and may never meet.' But, she told me that she felt the way that I did even before I said anything. Still I thought I was a bit crazy as I knew I would propably never meet her as she lives over the other side of the world from me. One day she told me she was going to be visiting  London  this August doing charity work in a soup kitchen and asked me if I would meet her when she came. Of course I said yes, and yes I know that it isnt even august yet, but wait a moment. Then our feelings became stronger for each other, I told her that  I loved her , it wasnt just a crush, and when I said it I ment it. And she said it back, I was so  happy .        Then one day, she told me that her brother was applying for a job in London, and they were looking for a house there. Next thing I knew was that they had got the house and it was in avillage called Barton-Le-Clay,  I couldn't believe it, she would be moving just  15 minuites  away from me. We would be able to see each other all the time, not once in a few years. Then one day, I got another one of my long awaited e-mail's from her, I couldn't wait to read it, but I should of known better, as after the first few lines I realised that this wasn't going to be a happy letter. She told me she had been to a three day Christian getaway(She's christian if you hadn't noticed), and at this place she had been able to give up hersin, and that washomosexuality. She told me she no longer loved me asshe would a girlfriend or a wife, but shestill loved me as a close friend or a sister. It hurtso much that day. Everything seemed unreal. Blurred by the light. I was so confused and Icouldn't understand anything that was goingaround in my mind. I didn't understand how her homosexuality and love for mecould just disappear over night.        After a lot of talking and crying, we finally sorted things out. She said that she did still love me, and I was the onlygirl she liked anymore as she didnt want tokiss this girl as shedid previously. It's all very long and complex,I'm sure you don't want to hear itall. Anyway, Iwas asking her questions aboutwhat had happened and I hadone last question for her, was she still moving here? She told me she was, but without herBrother, as the job for her brother fell through and she was going to move on her own, but get a different house or appartment that she could afford. She will be working in london, she already has a job position waiting for her, and she is hoping to find a place to live in the bedforshire area so we can still see each other.        So thats why I am so happy at the moment. Long story hey! Anyway I will tell you alot more as the days go on, or if you have any questions then add them to the feed back! See you for now!
