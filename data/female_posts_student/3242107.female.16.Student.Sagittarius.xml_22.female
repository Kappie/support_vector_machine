" and it prolly didnt help that when we were leaving hard rock walking, everyone picked up the hooker ads and porno mags out of the magazine racks and started flipping through the guys and making fun of some "things". lol but yea good times. then we left and drove down the strip one last time andamy jumped out of the car at an intersection to take a pick of the m place . great idea right. haha so then we went to the airport and some chinese guy cut me in line and mr renfro- beccas dad went bazirk and went up to him and was yelling at him and telling him to go back to the end of the line. it was cool what sucked was that by the time we got to our gate it was like 11 nad everything was closed and me and amers were thirsty and couldnt find any water or anything so we went and watched some old people play the slots by the gate, and we all played cards on the floor bc our flight wasnt for like atleast and hour and when we got back home in houston my dad was waiting for us in baggage claim and it was already light outside. our flight landed at like 6 something.  but it was the best time ever. too many memories.. the gay bar, cali, getting lost, the hotel, kitty, losing money haha except for mandi lol, cilla not being able to stop crapping, megan waking up and screaming and me and mandi being next door, beating all the cali teams, and only losing 1 game, all 3 teams from texas that were invited getting in the top 10-> elkins taking 1st, south lake carrol taking 3rd and us taking 9th. the stupid bandage mr mike put on my leg that changed the color of my knee, and stayed that color for months, all the dinners and that one lunch at that place with the ppl that had off campus lunch- ugh, EVERYTHING! but the best part had to be morgan's lil bro kyle running up to some cali team saying we heard them dissing us and staring crap. that was funny. but i def wont forget when that one girl from south lake carrol dove into home and landed wrong. that was super scary. we were watching and cheering them on, and it happened and we all freaked bc megan and their pitcher were friends on the same select team. the girl coudlnt move and they had to call an ambulance it was so scary omm. but she ended up being ok so that was good. but all in all spring high softball + 4 vans + las vegas + hoover dam + and the tournament of champions national invitational softball tournament- ramada express = our principal regretting letting us go. haha jk jk the best spring break ever!
