It shows up for you because the image is already cached on your computer, but it just shows an "X" in the corner for everyone else. Since you sent me Cel's graduation picture, I took the liberty of uploading it to your space. I changed the image source from HTTP://WWW.GEOCITIES.COM/PIAE16/CELGRADPIX.JPG to just CELGRADPIX.JPG both here and in your personal blog. You can upload more stuff by using an FTP program (you should already have WinFTP installed in your computer, I believe it comes standard in all Windows platforms). If you do not like WinFTP, you can easily download CuteFTP. It's very popular and it's readily available. Check your email for the FTP info (ftp site, user name and password).. I'm emailing it to you right now.
