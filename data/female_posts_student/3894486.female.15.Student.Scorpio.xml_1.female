Maria came over at like 6.10 and we went and saw the notebook! that movie is soo great! We cryed our eyes out lol it was soo good! Plus the lead guy is super hott! lol but yeah so we can back to my house where the cake that I had baked(all by myself! hehe) and I sang happy birthday to her and then we had some yummy pizza and then ate cake...danielle came over also so we had fun!
