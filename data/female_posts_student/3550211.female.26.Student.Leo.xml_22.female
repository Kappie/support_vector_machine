Anyway, this is an interesting  urlLink article  about a new Jewish magazine.   I quote: "Self-satire has a long tradition in Jewish culture," said founder Jennifer Bleyer, 26. "Our magazine takes that tradition and applies it to the interests and media habits of an underserved audience of young Jews."
