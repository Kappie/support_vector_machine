I clicked on it out of curiousity, andon the page that loaded,I found a Gay Q with a guy named Steve, who is a homosexual. It broke my heart when I read this one:   Q. Steve, what can we do to get these bible abusers to get real and acknoledge that they are trying to steal civil rights from a minority, as the Nazi's did repeatedly in the early 30's ? They refuse to see their own bigotry, THEY make blind assumptions and present them as FACTS. I never asked to be gay. I tried to be "normal" for these people, it caused YET another failed marriage in America, and MORE children raised in a "broken home" when I could no longer live a lie !  -Dolphins fan 4 life, Memphis, TN  A. Dolphins fan, the best thing people can do is to tell their own stories, just as you've done. I'm sure other gay people will relate and nongay people will have something to think about. Thanks.    Christians  are the ones making blind assumptions? Well who is calling who a Nazi, here?   Dear Dolphins fan 4 life,  Okay, first of all: I'm sorry that the experiences you have hadwith Christians were so awful that you nowassociateall of uswith Nazis and call us "bible abusers." But, well, we're not like Nazis, really.It hurts that you're making such a blind assumption of us,Dolphins fan.If we were like Nazis... well, things would be a lot worse for you, is all I can say. In case you didn't know, Hitler killed Christians. He wanted to create a new world religion and replace Jesus Christ as the central figure of worship with himself. He is not our best friend. So if you don't mind, don't call us Nazis.   Second of all, I would just like you to know that the Christian "agenda" is not to "steal civil rights from a minority." That's blind assumption number two forya, buddy. What would be the point in stealing civil rights fromsomeone?It's not like they're something we can hoard all to ourselves, oranything. "Ahaha, these are MY civil rights! Precioussss!" No. That is notwhat Christians want. At least, that isn't what REAL Christianswant. Sometimes, asChristians, wecan come off a little strong with our fire and brimstone talk, butultimately... well,realChristians want to spread the truth of God'sWord to the world. We're not supposed to point fingers andact like we're better than everyone else, because we're not. But, well, like it or not, God's Word says that homosexuality is a SIN. Yes, that's right. SIN.It's a hard word to hear, I know.But guess what, EVERYBODY DOES IT! MYSELF INCLUDED!SIN IS A HARD THING TO DEAL WITH!The ONLY difference between usis that I recognize my need for a Savior. I know I sin. I know I can't do anything worth doingapart from Christ. And I know and believethat Jesusis the only way for me to escape the consequences of sin.  (Collective gasp) WHAT? There are CONSEQUENCES for SIN? But... I thought I could just do whatever the heck I wanted and get away with it! Isn't that what America is all about?  IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT IT SURE IS LOOKING THAT WAY LATELY.   But you know what the absolute greatest part is? Yeah, there are consequences for sinning. To put it bluntly, people who sin go to hell. Which means that all of us are condemned to hell. (Oh yes! I  went  there! Final destination for sinners = HELL!) But you don't have to go to hell.  What? But you just said...  Yeah. Remember Jesus? You know, the guy who came to Earth roughly2000 years ago...? Well, he did this thing for us. He died. On the cross. He was crucified, which is actually a pretty painful way to die. I don't know for sure, but I wouldeven venture that it is probably THE most painful way to die. But see, he didn't die because he did something wrong. In fact, he never did ANYTHING wrong in his entire life. He never sinned, not once. Which is pretty amazing, if you think about it. The reason he was able to not sin his entire life was because he was actually God in the flesh, which is even more incredible. God! Walking around! On   Earth!  TALKING to people!Come on, doesn't that mean something to you? It sure means something to me. You know why? Because he came to Earth to die for ME. He did it because he for some insane reason LOVES me and wants me to be with him in heaven for eternity. So when he rose again three days after he was put into the grave, he had conquered death and from then on, all you had to do was believe in him as your Savior and follow him. That's it. Believing in Jesus = salvation from sin and its consequences.It's REALLY not thathard to understand.   Dolphins fan, in fear of sounding incredibly hateful, let me just say this. Gays and lesbians should NOT be whining about being persecuted. You're getting an amazing amount of press because of all yourvarious antics, and all the blame for your supposed "unhappiness" is landing on us Christians. After all, we're the ones upholding the founding fathers' Constitution. We're the ones who want to keep America's last bit of purity before we lose it completely. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not bitter about the whole persecution thing. It's promised in the Bible that because the world hated Jesus, they will hate his followers. So really, I don't care if you do it. But because this is America, and we have freedom of speech and religion, I'm able to defend what I believe, which is what I'm doing.   I'm a Christian. Am I afraid of change, like everyone always accuses us of being? YES! I an desperately afraid that this nation is going to forget their Creator. I'm so scared that America is going to be a highway for others in the world to be led astray, and I'm scared that even more people are going to end up separated from God for eternity. It is MIND BOGGLING that SO many people actually believe the lie that they were "born that way." Satan is having his way with this country. Homosexuality isn't the only thing that's wrong with us.Thereis a plethora of other things that should worry any thinking person.Why wouldn't I be afraid? But thankfully, he who is in me is greater than he who is in the world. And he's our only prayer right now. He's always been our only prayer, and personally, I wouldn't have it any other way.  Sincerely, Sarah  Dear Steve,  Thank you for posting that comment. It did give me something to think about.  Love, Sarah
