(Doesn't sound like it, but it was) Well... I'm feeling better, but I'm free from school cause of holidays, so I'll be running around like an idiot anyway *ah well* Actually, I think I'll act dead for a few days, then go on a hyper sugar streak of activity *mostly running around buying chocolate bananas* Mmm... random. Heeey that would be lush! Chocolate bananas! And... and... strawberry cheese! Wow, I should totally become some one in the food industry! 'You don't need to diet when you've got Katie's TM R PQC food near you' Muhaha.... dieting fools, I shall rule the world! (Funny how most of my blogs come back to ruling the world)
