Of course I won't be able too start working until after August 20th because I would be so fired if I told my employers that I couldn't work for three weeks out of the summer because I'm vacationing, or partying, or going to the beach with my family or otherwise doing another job for no pay at Science World, all of which was previously planned. Ya I don't think that they'd like that at all.   You know I seem to be doing a total mend thing this comeing year. School year I mean. I'm cleaning my room, slowly yet surely, thus instilling more organization into my life. I'm trying to get a job, thus preparing to save for univercity. I plan on clubbing myself out, i.e. debate club, writer's club, arts council, possibly dance councill, I plan on starting liturature week in our school again, and probably another club becuase it looks really good on scholareship apps, that and I want to volenteer somewhere. Plus I'm going to be working out at least two times a week, somehow. Luckily I can re-organize work outs. The only thing I'm not planning for is a social life.   And if I do get a job then I have to be careful because I want to do that conferance in surrey at the end of October. What if I can't get the time off... Oh I'm stressing myself out and none of this has even happened yet.  I think I should keep a work out log... Naw that would just deter me. I plan on editing some more today, somehow. If I have time. I really hope I do, it'll be nice. I plan on finishing the Fraser part in beth's chapters, and the Taryne part is kind of sliding into place all on it's own. Of course I never know what to do with Taryne. She refuses to tell me ahead of time. But I can guess. What we have hard copy at the moment is amusing but kind of pathetic. Pathetic in that it sounds really young. No one except our parents would think it was worth anything. Poor Beth  might be a bit disappointed though she really enjoyed writing that part. Well I'll have to break it to her gentally. She's a big girl she'll get over it.   Well I have so much more to tell and so little time. Maybe I'll post later. It doesn't really take me long. Yes I believe I will. Ta ta for now
