And that was at 9:00 a.m.    I stopped at Balthazar for coffee and a free bite of walnut-raisin bread, and also so I could feel for a moment like someone who had any business buying coffee at Balthazar (i.e., not a graduate student).    Anyhow, I was walking along Spring Street and there were a bunch of construction workers with a jackhammer, messing around in a hole in the street.  I was walking all weird, trying not to glisten too much (for those who don't know: women glisten, they don't sweat) or let my legs stick to the insides of my pants. Gross!    As I reached the towering heights of primma-donna-dom, I looked at these guys in their heavy jeans, equipment and plastic helmets, and with dust all stuck to their sweaty selves, and I thought about how they had to go about this all goddamn day.  I felt thankful for consrtuction workers then, because no matter how much you get paid, that sucks.  Plus they make our streets  less hopeless.  I talked to my friend Bill about this and he made the half-hearted suggestion that perhaps the manliness quotient makes the suffering worth it to them, but I'm skeptical.    Today there is an article in the New York Times about the  urlLink secret language  of garbage collectors. (Read the article to find out what "disco rice" is.)  That reminded me how thankful I am for sanitation workers, too.  Not only does the trash on the street stink exceptionally during the summer, but my dog is always trying to nose around in it and eat old chicken bones.  every Friday afternoon, I am so glad when it is gone.  I think it's important to remember that actual, real human beings came and picked it up, it didn't just disappear while I was at work.    There is this ongoing business with people refusing to say "police" or "firemen" here, it always has to be "New York's Bravest" or "New York's Finest"  --- or more annoyingly, just abbreviated to "Bravest" or "Finest," as in:  urlLink Finest Plants Bomb in Times Square Subway .  I am grateful for firemen, I'm not trying to pick on them whatsoever or co-opt their nickname.  But why not take a little time to recognize the invaluable contribution of construction workers in all their finest-ness.  And when your daily duties include the very real risk of rat bites, who would dispute that the garbage collectors are super brave?
