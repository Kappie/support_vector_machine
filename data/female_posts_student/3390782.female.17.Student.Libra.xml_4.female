I hit a fucking brick wall and everything is shattered into a million, jagged, pieces. Then, when I try to pick the pieces up, I cut my hands and just end up drowning in a pool of my blood and I have no one to blame except myself. I wish that just once, my life wouldn't be a fucked-up mess! I thought I found happiness. I thought that I would no longer be this angry little Goth who hates everything unless it will destroy her. I thought I had a reason to wake-up in the morning. I couldn't have been more wrong! I have nothing, NOTHING!! And I believe in nothing! I AM NOTHING! I just wanted to be happy and this is what a get. I can't even lay down because of all the fucking knives that are in my back! I wish that, just for once, instead of me bleeding for everyone else, I wish someonewould bleed for me. No one has ever bled for me. I passed out last night, for some odd reason,and I woke up with the most fucked-up headache and no one cares. I don't even care. I have no purpose in my life except to destroy myself. I don't even have to do it because everyone else is doing a great job destroying me. I have suffered for so long and I don't see an end. Someone, anyone, please hear my cry and if you know me, or even if you don't know me, if you care, then let me know because I feel so alone right now.
