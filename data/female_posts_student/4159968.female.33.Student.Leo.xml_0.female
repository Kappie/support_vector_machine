So they did.  The girls are not exactly thrilled to have 2 strange males in the house... and since its still drizzling Mys is pacing back and forth from the door to the chair unable to settle.  They will be mostly done tomorrow... which is cool... but dang ... now I have so much to do and am still stumped ... have my bed that is still not here.. still have no mattresses for it... still ahve to get the carpet in...   I know its a never ending battle but a respite would be nice.
