I HATE THE DAMN SCHOOL... and they better frikin call me back so i can make a damn appointment to get this schedule fixed or else I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL ON AUGUST 30!!!  cause theres no way i'm taking 2 ap courses, hon chem, french 5 AND on top of that.. hon english so they better get that out of there and give me my web page design class or they are going to have one very angry student on their hands.. and they don't want that.        ok i'm bored so i'm just gonna keep going but u have permission to leave if you're bored.      heres a song i really like and i just need to put it in here:      you can find me   if you ever want again   i'll be around the bend   i'll be around the bend   i'll be around...      and if you never stop when you wave goodbye   you just might find if you give it time you will wave hello again   you just might wave hello again      and thats the way this wheel keeps working now   thats the way this wheel keeps working now      you can't love too much one part of it   you can't love too much one part of it      i believe that my lifes gonna see   the love i give returned to me      -john mayer for all those people who didn't know      ook i think i'm really done now..      peace out!      -j
