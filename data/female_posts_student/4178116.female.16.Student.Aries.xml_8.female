They had to scan some pictures for their aunts slideshow, for her birthday. We are supposed to go to lunch on Friday because that's the last time we will be together for a long time. My cousin Justin is going off to college and he leaves the  15th , but I will be in San Francisco so I won't be able to see him off. He will be back for Christmas, but that is so far away. I am kinda tired so I will write some more tomorrow.
