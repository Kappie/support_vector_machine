I'm at this concert type thing, its a dark buliding with like multicolored stage lights and black lights and has the glow under black light writting on the walls. Pink, white and yellow writting. I spotted these 2 good looking guys sitting at a table (this is in the end of the dream, i forgot what happened before all of this..) but i go up to them and take my guitar and ask them to tune it. They are both skater types. The cutest one says sure and starts to tune, as he's strumming the strings the 2nd one starts to really wiggle and is way outta tune, its too loose, so i kinda laughed and said "yeah i tried to tune it but gave up..as u can tell" he fixed it and said no problem, while hes tuning my guitar im talking to his friend and we go over and sit to watch whatever we were suppose to be watching. I then walk off to talk to my mom and she tells me it's time to go. I walk straight back over to the guy sitting down, hop in his lap, and totally start makingout with him while my mom is standing there waiting for me to go. lol Then i go over to skater boy and get my guitar and then totally kiss him as well. dammit..i think im a lil too forward.   YAY that was my pathetic dream..yup yup..  Lorne just called me baby and asked me if i was talking to anyone (as in guys)...im gonna throw up. LMAO  I also just got off the phone with Kaela and shes excited that i'll be home tomorrow....this is my last nite in TN!!! i swear, im sooo excited to go home and now im craving those chicken wings in the fridge..yum...  Anyways....  *much love and chicken wings*
