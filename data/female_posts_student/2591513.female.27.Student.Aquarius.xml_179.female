Anyway, I still have mine and wanted to get it published.  Does anyone know how to go about doing that?  LOL  Maybe it isn't that great, but it holds great sentimental value.  So who knows.  I am extremely bored today.  Can you tell?  Is the three blogs any indication of this boredom?  I am trying not to turn the A/C on....but I am not sure how much longer I can hold off.  It is extremely hot.  I don't want to go into the pool because I refuse to get sun burn.  I got bad sunburn a couple of years ago that took a couple of years to go away (the tan portion).  So anyhow, I am here contemplating life, dreading the next semester and thinking about life after graduation (albeit three years or so from now).  I will be so happy when I get to graduate and see my babies cheering me on...Oh I can't wait.  But baby steps.  I have to remember that each small steps I take are bringing me closer to the goal...I just need to remember that getting closer is better than getting no where.  Well I better get going again...I am going to have to try and stay off this computer and reverting to blogging to procrastinate from cleaning or doing something more productive.
