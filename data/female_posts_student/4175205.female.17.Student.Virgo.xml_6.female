I had Codys explorer and didnt have a car that is my own(well that i like to drive anyway-seperate story) anyway i like to drive Codys explorer and i felt like listening to a certain cd(butterfly boucher) and i felt like driving, so i agreed to drive Joy to the store and normally i would sit in the car and wait, but i actually went in with her. She was like wow! While we were walking around HEB i saw a package of peporoni and i found myself saying "me and cathy(my best friend) used to eat those raw". So i got some cuz they looked so damn good. But i keep seeing and thinking of little things like that. It's the little things i miss somtimes.
