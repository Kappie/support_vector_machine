I've got a lot of stuff to do...I need to review, I've gotta pack for the family reunion. I'm leaving Wednesday morning...we're holding the reunion in Tennessee so everyone can meet halfway. *sigh* Oh boy...I need to take the Illiad and Ethan Frome and work on those on the way.  Ah, I also need to learn to drive. I'm seventeen years old and I don't even have a license. I have a car, I just can't DRIVE it. The logic in that? Umm...I'd say none. I know people worse off that I am, however.  More later. I'm gonna go eat, which is what I do best.
