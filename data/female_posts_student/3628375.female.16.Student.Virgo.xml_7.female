But when he lived with his dad, nothing really stopped him except his dad was stricter than his mom. But when he lived at his dad's it put a HUGE damper on our relationship because he was so far away and it was difficult for us to see one another, its just so hard. I just wish I could jump in his head and let him feel the things I feel and how bad I freak out when he does this crap. I really hope he learns his damn lesson...I love him so much, and I hate when I can't reach him.   Gotta go...tootles!!!  ***Look forward to a brighter day, the sun has to rise sooner or later***
