He appears to be a kind person and like he really cares about you and your 'spirit man'. He doesn't strut around the podium with a holier than thou attitude. No, he preaches about forgiveness, love, and hope for the future. Today's sermon was "God wants to Restore" or something like that. The gist was that if you are having a hard time, God wants you to come out of your troubles with more than you had before. All very soothing and motivating. It doesn't hurt that he is an attractive man and his wife is just as cute.  That is why I wake up on Sunday mornings and stumble downstairs to listen. I've been a little upset lately because Pastor Joel is selling his first book  and he is giving sermons in far flung cities. I don't like to share.  I gave up believing in religion a long time ago.  And that is a long, long, story. Still, there is a part of me that wants to believe in that picture perfect way of life.   You know, God-fearing people who are all loving and wear their best to church on Sundays. I wish that all christians were as loving as Mr. Osteen seems to be. But I've never met any.
