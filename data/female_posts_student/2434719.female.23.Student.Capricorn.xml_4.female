IF YOU DON'T CARE WHAT'S THE POINT. i just asked someone that.  i am so tired.  oh whoa i'ts almost april fools day...  when i was a kid, i'd always fake an injury, so when my dad came home i'd be on crutches, or have my arm in a sling, etc....  he NEVER fell for it. he wouldn't even pretend!  drove me insane.  but i could get my mom.... oh man.  i'd HAND WRITE a detention notice.  and she'd FALL for it.  amazing.  something i remembered today taht i hadn't thought of in ages... was the bedtime stories my dad used to tell me as a kid. they were always about farmer brown.  farmer brown had this chicken coop, and there was always this fox trying to sneak in the middle of hte night and steal farmer brown's chickens. oh but that silly fox always got caught :)  goodnight kids. :)
