Was loadsa fun had a great time and still managed to get up in time for work despite Ian and Smart staying and chatting to my parents for ages after walking me home, bless you guys you deserve an award.  Have had a good weekend.  Went to my Aunt and Uncle's, stayed up til early hours playing cards for pennies and generally having lots of giggles at my father's expense.  Bless him, but he will drink too much and start sneezing and try laying clubs as spades etc.  Slept on the sofa, well i say slept, more like lightly dozed for the 4 hours between going to bed and getting up again for a shower and realising I left practically everything at home.  Then we all trundled off after waiting for Bev to get ready (as per fucking usual) to Dagenham market, home of the essex girls!! WOOHOO, got some fake tans and sovereigns going on there.  I only got a ring, which meine Mutti got for me due to her buying some ridiculously ugly some-strange-era inspired bag for said time waster (ie:BEV).  I have to say my ring is much better then her bowling ball sized bag.  So then we all went home, and I got a squished and bloody fly in my hair because I try pose too much in my cousin's car.  Ah well, if he wants to do 120 down the motorway with the windows open and the system up, I'm not gonna stop him.  I actually almost shat myself though when I watched the speedo creep up, I thought, oh god shall I get my pad of paper out and start writing my goodbye letters now?  ANYWAY so I'm home now and missed the last bits of the football match but n/m, I'm sure we lost, as we usually do.
