The secconds,minutes,hours,days,weeks,mounths and years pass by I still dont know why i dont have my Mum.  I hate Cancer that's what took my Mum away Why she had to get it i just don't know I wish I could earse the pain and the past and find her still here with me at last.  To feel her warmth around me to hear her Gentle voice to feel loved and cared for is my wish i have.No one to comfort me no one to talk to Mum i want you back i need you.  I love you with all of my heart and i miss you so please know that I am sorry for the years of pain if only i could have been a better daughter if only ... and what if... and maybe....  I love you Mum forever and always in my heart Your everlasting loving daughter-(not written by me)
