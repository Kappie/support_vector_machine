The evening is what I hate the most. I mean Mondays are okay because you're already there, you can't get out of it. But Sunday evening is just before it, so you have that anticipation for Monday.  Five more days until Spring Break. 20 Periods. And I get out all day Tuesday so that's only 16 for me.  It's sad I'd rather be going through torture at the orthadontist then at school. School isn't that bad.  I know first semester was a whole lot worse, so I don't let it get to me too much.  I'm thinking of doing this blog thing regularily. Since I haven't been. Nobody reads it though.  I guess that doesn't matter.  Nope. Doesn't matter at all.
