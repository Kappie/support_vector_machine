It makes me sad  What have I done  to make him mad  I havenâ€™t said a word  nor given a look  but he took my gift   my art  and destroyed them both  for no reason at all  I just don't get it  I've done nothing wrong  So why does he hate me  it makes me sad...   He probably expects me  to destroy all his gifts  but I'll just hold them  even closer to my heart  I wish I could just  make him happy  But I know I can't  and that makes me sad...   Why me?  Why now?  Why him?  Why us?  I just don't understand  It makes me sad...
