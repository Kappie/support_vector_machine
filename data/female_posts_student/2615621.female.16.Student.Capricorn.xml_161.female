Its either listenin to music or surfin www.purevolume.com and listening to music. some of those bands are KICKASS but others im like..umm dude, theres a reason why ur band hasnt left purevolume's site...Limbeck is freakin awesome, i love those guys! they're on purevolume, but they left (knew they would!) and everyone should go out and buy their cd. Their single JULIA is so about me..execpt my intials arent JRC..lol To listen to their whole cd go to www.hieverythingsgreat.com Right now im listening to Howie Day.
