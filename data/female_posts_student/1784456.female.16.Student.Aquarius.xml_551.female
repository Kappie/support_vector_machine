If they actually send me the email! I lost the old ones so i have a new pen-name (hopefully) now. Hahahaaaa! twas funny, mum forgot to clean out Russell's cage, and left it a couple of days later than normal, and we found the Russell had chewed a huge hole right through the plastic in protest!! If he had chewed any longer it would have been big enough for him to get through! He is not a normal hampster. He is too smart for his own good! He can stear a hampster ball  perfectly  around corners and he knows his way around everywhere! He knows that if he has no food left in his bowl, and we're all in the kitchen, if he hangs from the bars of the top of his cage, we'll notice him and notice that his food bowl's empty! Weird, but smart....perhaps...to smart.
