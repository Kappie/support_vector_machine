Ok so I just got back from Evas dance recital it was tres tres good. Eva you are a dancing queen! haha Taryn I am almost positive that she is still virginal! I ate a McFlurry as well very fattening, very worth it! Tomorow is the Park Societys goodbye meeting, not that we are breaking up, oh no never will that happen! I will now give you my opinion on Bjork, you may not want it, but meh I don't really care. She is a funny lady.She enjoys her sulfer and Her songs are very good. She has a pretty voice and I think if the Spice Girls (whom I loved as a young lass, as well as now) should invite her to come and take Geri's spot! Oh was I ever mad when Geri left! I think if I can recall correctly that I cried, well mabey it was more of a blubbering wheezing sort of deal! Ha ha Well I am off Roast Chicken awaits me, which is a good thing I like it!
