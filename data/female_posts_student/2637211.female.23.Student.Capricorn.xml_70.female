They make me want to dance and scream and faint, all at once. Oh yeah, they make me want to sing.  Last night I went with Lisa to the Law School Prom and had a good time, but I'm now suffering the effects of dancing in high heels and drinking too much Jack Daniels: my feet hurt like a bitch and I'm a bit twitchy and ever so slightly hung over. Nothing that can't be fixed by a day of reading and a good breakfast.
