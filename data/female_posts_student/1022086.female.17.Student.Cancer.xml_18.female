At least I got to sing for 2/3 of my weekend, and it was definitely worth the time.   I can't go to Spivey Workshop *frown*; I was heading out the door to go to choir and turn in my application on Friday, and Mrs. Dunn decided to inform us that we have a quiz Tuesday and a test Wednesday. I could have dealt with missing both the Chemistry and Quackulus quizzes, but we will be tested on the proofs of the Fundamental Theorems on Wednesday, and because I don't really understand those, I likely don't need to miss class on Tuesday, when she will review and likely answer questions. I hate school so very much. I'm starting to hate math, too, believe it or not... It's not only the fact that I am exorbitantly crushed by my not being able to go to Spivey, but also the fact that it no longer interests me and only seems to frustrate me. Although I love astronomy, it involves massive amounts of mathematics, obviously, and I haven't exactly decided whether I will eventually begin hating Physics, too, once I actually study it in depth.  I am leaning toward the idea of taking Theory again. Erin tells me that the class really is worth it, and she seems really engaged positively in the class. I have not made up my mind yet, but I think I'd enjoy studying theory more than anything else. I will get a final feedback from more people at the end of the year and see how that goes.   My mom really does not seem to like my idea of studying music other than, perhaps, as a minor in college and making it my profession. I don't understand why. Anytime I question her "hmm"s or twisted expressions as I mention a career in music, her answer is "do whatever you like." A career in music does not necessarily involve performance- although if I go into music, it will likely be choral directing. I just don't know what to make out of anything. I have applications to fill out that I have yet not gotten to and don't know exactly when I will, and I'm getting ever more confused by the second.   I just don't want to do something that I'll eventually hate. It has been proven to me that, even if one thinks he or she completely loves something, it often happens that his or her idea changes with time. Music is the only thing that has not disappointed me so thus far in life, and although many will say that it is not a panacea, it really is. I cannot think of a time I am happier to be somewhere than when I am on stage performing, hearing voices being molded by expert hands and realizing that everyone around me feels the same and knowing that I am a part of a phenomenon that can change the life of anyone in the room. And it really is a phenomenon.     Oh, yeah, and my mom is knitting again for the first time in probably 10 years and remembers how to do it perfectly. She's knitting me a throw, and I'm deeply touched. It's multi-shade-and-tint blue.
