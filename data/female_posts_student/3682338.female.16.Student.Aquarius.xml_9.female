AwEsOmE huh!?! jk. but i didnt find the kind i wanted so i shall search again for those tomorrow. so when i got home i went outside and harassed some rabbits. lol. no really ive been waitin to see when some little baby rabbits are gonna come out of their nest. my yard is like a bunny farm. you should see it. im not joking. oh well tho. so after that i sat around and watched tv and stuff like that and that leads me to where i am now. typin on here. and i bet you are just enjoying every word you are reading right now huh? lol. i know i wouldnt be. i know its boring but hey-i was bored and had nothing else to do. but now i think im getting real tired of this so im gonna go.lol. later gator!
