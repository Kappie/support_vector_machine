There were all these weird french/native people putting their tubes on the raft which prevented anyone else from using it. Bastards.. there was a movie on tv the other day called bastards... true story... but i watched it and it was liek a documentary.. and they ate muffins.. ANYWAYS.... Caroloo had this bag and then it turned into a dirty water bag. Then we got cold and went home. Meatlof tried to have a vacation in Red Bank and meet the whore dogs down there but he did not end up going.
