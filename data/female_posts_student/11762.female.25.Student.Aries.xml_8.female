She died in her sleep; she had sat down to take a nap during the middle of the day and when her daughter came home from work, she discovered that her mother was no longer among the living.  The funeral took place on what would have been an otherwise gorgeous autumn afternoon. As I watched her casket being lowered into the ground, I could not help but ponder the irony of burying my grandmother, my spiritual rock, on such a day as that one.  A couple of years later, my family buried our beloved pet, Freckles, after he lost a brief, yet painful, battle with liver disease, an ailment that is very common amongst male cocker spaniels. It happened so fast and I will never forget my mother calling me and tearfully telling me about his passing. She loved that dog.  It seems that there is so much pain in life. Sometimes, I want to wail against Godde, because I know that she has the power to cease the world's suffering and sadness. Then, there are moments that I know I am growing stronger, because of the suffering that I have had to endure at times. The fall is the perfect time of year to reflect on that strength. In the tradition of the Celts, the autumn season has become my personal New Year's celebration. I use this time to re-focus my goals, especially since I have a habit of getting distracted over the summer. This is the time of year that I pay homage to those individuals who have passed through the veil.  I miss her. There are still days where I feel an overwhelming need to hear her voice over the phone or to hold her hand. When I realize that this is no longer a possibility, there is a sharp pain that runs straight through my heart. It takes my breath away and I start to leak silent tears.
