But this is something worth failing. YUCK.  I can't believe I saw a flasher. It's damn sick, and such indecent exposure should be condemned! This is the first time I saw a penis[and the balls] in my life, after my dinner somemore. I almost puked. It's THAT sick.  Man. And we were discussing why people would actually put that into their mouths, it's outrageously INSANE. it's GROSS. HAHAH! According to Shavon, she says that a penis is a gross thing because it's pertruding out of the body, whereas a cunt ain't that bad. But I guess if I see a woman sitting in front of me, flashing her cunt at me, I'll be shocked as well, and perhaps burst out in a fit of laughter. HAHAHAH! But the dick is one scary thing. I swear I'm not gonna eat Taiwan sausages for a few days. YUCCCCCCCCCCCK.  Back to some cleaner news.  Had speech day today which was fantastic. The seniors did really well and i wanna be just like that. Heh. I wanted to share something but it simply slipped out of my mind. Urgh.  Owell, shopping day tomorrow with my sis, but i've got nothing much in mind. Have not received my report book yet, although I did really badly, so atrocious that I feel like it's so "throw-face" for my parents to see, but i want to get it. Hmm.  OH OH OK I REMEMBER. In Lit today, we watched Pride and Prejudice, it's FANTASTIC. I shall go read the book later. Bought it a year ago but I've not read it yet. Hah. I love Lit these days. I love it when they flash shows for us to watch. =] I love to Kill a Mocking Bird. I love Pride and Prejudice. I love me. =D  Bye bye. Study hard kids!
