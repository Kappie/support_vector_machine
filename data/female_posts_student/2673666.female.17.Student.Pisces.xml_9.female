The links have gone, mainly because I'm crap with css so I couldn't figure out how to put them back properly. So, news... have had to give up work (well, I gave up whether or not I had to).  Back to my usual slacking self *sigh*.  Have gone on the pill, which is fecking great, Colin and I are VERY happy.  Twas a year since we met on Sunday.   urlLink APR  gig the other night was fab.  Pissed off because  urlLink 8th House  have found a drummer just as I was beginning to bring Colin round to the idea.  Bollocks.  Actually, I'm pretty miserable anyway, my skin's being a bitch thanks to the heat, but I can't really complain.  OK, I can, but I'll try not to.  Need to have a good think and sort my life out (again). Anyway, not much else to report. xL
