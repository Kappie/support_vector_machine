I was busy all night and did not get home until midnight last night, and I wasn't in the position to update the website. I hope Jackie is enjoying her time at Tampa Bay, because when she gets back, she is taking over update duty for a while.  Also, I want to know why I haven't gotten my fucking Mountain Dew hat yet. They shipped it on June 16th and I have yet to see it on my door step. I am getting mad, and when I get mad, I eat ham... Only replace eating ham with throwing things... and mad with pie... Because pie is fucking awsome.
