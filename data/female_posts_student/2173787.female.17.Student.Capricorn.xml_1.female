Hannah came over and we worked on our story book project, for 4 hours more or less steadily.  6 pages done woo hoo!! Anyways, before she left we got talking about all kinds of stuff, including ratemyteachers.com.  if you are ever really bored, or maybe just kind of bored check it out, there seems to be an entry on almost all of our teachers and its pretty amusing, especially when you try to match up people to comments.
