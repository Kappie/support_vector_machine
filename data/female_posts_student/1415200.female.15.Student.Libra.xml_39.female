All include: Dan, Harry, Pat, Bob, Jeanette, myself, and I think thats it. Then Harry, Dan, Joe are all comming over tomarrow. I think Rob is comming later. Oh well gotta go plead with mom.  --Later-- Alright. It's 9:15. Serious update time. Let's rock da socks off! Well chineese was fun. Though, Pat and Jeanette didn't show. I forgot Jen was grounded and that Pat dosent do anything without his better half. Oops. So it was just me, dan, harry, and bob. O yea. Harry's gma was there too.  I miss having our group together. Just the 4 of us. It hasnt been that way in a while. So, I guess things are just changing. Have I ever told you I dont like change? I dont like change. Gots a new sn. I didnt like the xsurfpunk07 thing. Kinda gay. Oh, well. Im gonna go. I gotta get an icon. Plus, I cant type 'hard' the mother is sleeping. and drama calls. Like ive said before. Ppl cant live without me.
