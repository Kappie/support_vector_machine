The kids of the Interfaith Choir were as upset to b there that early as us. We had to have nametags and since ppl thought that me, Katie, and Megan were sisters, we came up w/ the Smaxter Triplets by combining our last names and we put that on our nametags. We sang w/ Dr. Rollo Dilworth (s.c.) who actually believed that we were sisters, but when we took a pic w/ him we explained. He had a good laugh. But yea, he was amazing. We were so surprised he was young lol. He's composed like over 50 pieces of work and he's an awesome pianist. Boy's got soul! lol So we sang w/ this other choir. I thought their director was wicked creepy. We ended up singin ALL FREAKIN DAY. We took a break for lunch n after a while, Rollo had to go. The director of Interfaith arranged for recreation. There were three options: 1)Go outside, pray it doesn't rain n have a "good time", 2)Go outside, play in the rain, 3)Go to the gymnasium. Well, we, the Smaxters, didn't like those options so I mentioned we should ask about Secret Option Numba 4: shopping. We convinced Joel n Jeanene to let us go shopping. So a few of us escaped to participate in the infamous SON4 and we rode the "L". It was rainy and 50 something degrees outside. So we're walkin down State St. I think, and these little black boys, about 10 years old were riding their bikes and the one kid was like "You have a nice ass" And I was like excuse me? and he repeated it. And the kid on his bike behind us was like I think you have the nice ass, refering to Katie. So I learned my lesson in wearing shorts in Chicago: just don't. After that oddness, we shopped for about 20 minutes then had to go back to the L. We were caught in the rush hour traffic of it all and you really get to know people well after being smashed and stepped on a few times. Especially since we had to transfer trains. So we sang and sang and I had the worst headaches. The kids in Interfaith liked my shirt *ORLANDO!* and my nails *black n pink checkered!* After the concert, we hid in our little stairwell away from the littler kids like we had been. Then we left. We talked to Paul to let us ditch the museum the next day and continue son4 and he told us he'd think about it. They made our curfew 10 instead of 10:15 n we couldn't go into guys' rooms n they couldn't go into ours n it was kidna goofy. While I was startin to pack up along w/ Katie, I called my mom n filled her in n w/e. I got a part in Godspell Jr! I'm gonna b one of the soloists, but I think Loren overcast it...but there will prolly b a lot of kiddies dropping out like flies in weeks lol. Megan n me went to the computer while Katie talked to Al her bf *awww* I informed a few ppl and Brad's gonna get the Thezzies to come...I hope lol. I'll call Mitch, he'll get it done. So then Megan and me got back to our room after talkin to ppl online right before curfew lol. We then just talked and packed and looked at my pics of my goofy friends from school. So continues our adventures of the Smaxter sisters and others...btw, Paul denied son4 for the next day.
