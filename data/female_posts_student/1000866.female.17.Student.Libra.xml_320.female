Really. I guess, my theory on life is that I might as well enjoy it while I'm here. I suppose though, when I become so big that I'll have to pay for two airline tickets because the seats aren't large enough, I wont be enjoying life. "Excuse me miss, but your fat ass wont fit in one seat. We'll need you to buy two tickets."  And of course, I'll never be able to go to a farm. OK, so I like cities better, but still. I like farms sometimes. I'll get mixed in with the cows. Someone will try to milk me, and that'll be it. I'll sit on them. And then I'll be charged with murder and high tail it out of there. "Dangerous woman on the loose armed with her own fat. Please be extremely cautious." Of course, there is one good thing about all of this. I'll be able to be in the Guiness Book of World Records, which would be quite cool. I bet I'll be the only albino 2000 pound woman ever.    Oh the possibilities.
