I'm having premonitions about me having arthritis in there 30 years from now. ;)  I'm browsing sooo many personal sites to get ideas for my own.. among them, I found a review site, whose sole purpose is to review other personal sites and give them ratings out of 100. Am I the only one that finds this idea completely arrogant and condescending? I mean, if you need some stranger's approval of your site, maybe you need a different hobby. My site's for me and I personally couldn't give a shit what a bunch of elitist snobs think as long as I'm happy with it.
