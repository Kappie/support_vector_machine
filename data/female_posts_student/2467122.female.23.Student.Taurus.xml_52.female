Monday was the Teacher Empowerment lecture at Sarah Lawrence College with Sheila, a teacher/professor who lives in my dad's building.  I met Jane Andrias and heard her keynote speech about her life as a young teacher and as director of Central Park East 1.  I met so many cool teachers and people in charge of all kinds of different masters programs in New York.  We'll see where that goes, but for now, I will totally stay in touch with Sheila.  Tuesday I went to see the taping of Late Night with Conan O'Brien with my sister and her friends.  It was SOOO funny!!!  Conan is freakishly tall in real life, but oh, so hilarious!  We got front row seats and one of Laura's friends was actually on TV.  This kid was only 18, but he still managed to try and hit on me.  I will leave him to Laura, though- He is actually old enough to vote, so it's a step up.  After the taping we all headed over to Ellen's Stardust Diner, the one with the singing wait staff.  They are always really entertaining.  I had a total blast and it was cool to watch Late Night afterwards and know what was going to happen.    Today was an adventure also.  I picked up my paycheck, which was pretty sizable considering I worked twenty-eight and a half hours last week.  I took out some cash and headed to my mom's office.  We met my sister downtown and went to this totally cool little Indian restaurant where they served us a ton of yummy food and free wine and dessert with dinner.  There were like a million strings of lights, including Christmas lights and those pepper lights that you hang out in the yard, and if I had epilepsy it would have induced a seizure.  After that we walked back up St. Mark's Place to the take the train home... Only I convinced my mom to make a pit-stop into Andromeda (the tattoo and piercing studio) to look around.  I love that place, it's where I got my tattoo!  Well, long story short, I have a new hole in my body.  Don't worry, it's above the waist!  I am definitely going to make my way back there before the summer is over.   I guess that's all for now, but I will let you know how much it hurts tomorrow.  I cannot believe that it takes 6-8 months to heal.  *sigh*  We'll see after a few weeks how worth it this was.   And now for something completely different...          urlLink   What will God say to you when you die?
