Not too fond of memorizing anything that involves me having to stay up half the night punching myself. Kinda sad though, my brother will be leaving at the end of the month. It's nice having a family member here. It's so different with him here, I don't feel so empty. I always felt like something was wrong, something was missing. Hmmm... He'll leave and I'll feel like that again...   My brother and I almost got in a car accident this morning! It was so scary. We almost crashed into a semi-truck. I was shaken up for about an hour. I could tell my brother was pretty shaken up too, considering he was driving and all. He seemed kinda mad at the same time, I think he was mad at the truck driver. The driver was a retard, I don't think he even knew how to drive the semi properly. Whatever...   There was so much drama this past 4th of July weekend. The news was pretty shocking. I was sick to my stomach. But, sorry I can't say what it is. But I'll tell you this much, it's definitely Jerry Springer material!  Gotta go study!!
