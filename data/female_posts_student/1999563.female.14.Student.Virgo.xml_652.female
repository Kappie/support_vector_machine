[alrighty then...] I woke up at 3 and I just wandered around aimlessly for like a half an hour because I woke up way to early. I tried to update my blog but it wouldn't let me for some stupid reason. It was super stupid.  At 3:45 we went to go pickup Beka. On the way there I tried to get myself hyper so we turned on some oldies but they were playing really depressing music so Hannah and I just ended up turning the radio off and making our own music. Then Beka came in the car and we were all like "lalallalalallala" We finally got the airport and like 4:30. We were the first people there! It was crazy because everyone else was all concerened about getting htere 2 hours early [wow I just seenzed and got snot all over my jacket. Now that was atractive.]  So we got on our plane and that was pretty uneventful except this hot guy Beka liked sat near us and Beka was like "0OOOH!"   We had a layover in San Jose and I called Mandy. But being the smart person I am known to be I stood right in front of a  loud speaker and I couldn't hear anything she said and I doubt she heard anythign I said. Haha.  We got on another plane and finally arived in Ontario. Then Jackie Heather and I waited for Beka and Rhonda to show up with the rental car. They finally came and we all boarded the car to disney land.  Disney land was so frekaing scary. I thought I was going to die numerous times. But, I went on all the rides [Including splash mountain!] and I had a really good time.  But who cares about that?  Then we all loaded into the car off to San Diego. We got stuck in a traffic jam at MIDNIGHT! It was the weirdest thing ever.  We finally arrived at the Hilton and like 3 and we fell asleep so after our arrival.  At 8 I woke up and I was SUPER excited because I would get to meet all the other IMPROV PEOPLE! I mean really, husband potential.    I took a nice shower and blow dryed my hair with the crappy hotel dryer. I looked pretty good if I do say so myself.  SO we went to the Yacht club. At first I was really scared but after I met the first few people it was simply wonderful. At CYT Vancouver I always feel untalented, unatractive, and shy. But these people made me feel beautiful. They made me feel like i had self worth.   it was great.  We played this game called american eagle 1-2-3. It was SO scary but awesomely fun. There were two people in the middle of the beach and you had to run by them without getting picked up. They would pick up and yell "AMERICAN EAGLE 1-2-3" then throw you on the ground before you touched it. It was fun! I lost so soon though. I think it's because I don't weigh much, i'm and easy target. :) This guy who was probably 16 just picked me up then "dink" set me back on the sand. I am glad I didn't get injured! :)  Then I met the pink team. We ate lunch with them. They were SO awesome!!! This one guys name was David Hott! Hahhahaha. For the rest of the day I just called him the Hott one. Hahhaa. He was pretty atractive, but not my type.  After a day at the yacht club we went back to our hotel room to rest but we didn't get much rest. I called Mandy and got to talk to her for a long time which was nice. Then I called my Mumsy. :)  Then we went to In and Out burger! YUM!!!!!  After that we practiced for along time. But I REALLY wanted to go to the Bingo party to hand out with all these cool people. But, alas, we were 30 minutes late. It was still a lot of fun though! I met this girl named Jen whof or her summer job dressed up like orky the Otter at Sea world! Hahhaha. Then I met Andrew....*sigh* He is so beautiful.  Back to the Bingo party.  So, I totally lost. Hahaha. It was not cool. BUt it didn't really matter because most of the time I talked to all the cool people. I cannot get over how cool they all were. I wish we all lived in the same town so I could see them all everyday.  After the bingo party I was just haning around tlaking to people and for some reaosn Jen started kicking me jokingly so we got into this "huge" fight. It rocked.  Then Beka made me leave to go pratice. On our way to the elevators I saw andrew and his cute friend [not to mention they didn't have shirts on. wow that sounded really bad. I am never saying that again!!] and they were like "Do you wanna go swimming with us??" and I was like "DO I EVER" but I couldn't because we had to practice. It was sad.  SO we went to bed at like 2 and woke up at 8 for the Improvathon.  It was fun.  I don't really want to expand on it because I only have 10 minutes left of time on this library computer butttt...  We got there at about 12:30 and just hung out with our team. I REALLY wanted to hang out with the other people but I couldn't. Then it started. We did SUPER good on our two games but for some reason the judges hated us so we got out in the first round. Afterwards allllllll these people we had never seen before came up to us and were like "You guys were cheated out of your first place title!" Everyone on our team was SUPER upset and they were all crying. But for some reason I didn't feel that sad. I geuss I should have, but i wasn't.  Then we left and I didn't get to say good bye to the pink team which made me really sad...  Then we went to Fuddruckers. I got to hang out some with Andrew and His mom. We talked about the Beatles like the whole time. Andrews mom was met PAUL MCCARTNEY. I was so jealous. Paul is andrews favorite beatle tooo. I love that boy.  Oh no my time is almost up so I shall say one shocking detail of my trip, I HUGEED GUYS. LOTS OF THEM! But I didn't get to hug andrew which was quite sad.....so here is my officail list of *doo de doo*  GUYS LAURA HUGEED! Justin Tim Ben Kendrick   ooh crap. I forgot everyones names.  Haha  Well I hugged like 4 other guys. Look at me gooo! Wow. This was a weird post. I will post more tomorrow. I LOVE YOU GUYS!  Laura Fantora
