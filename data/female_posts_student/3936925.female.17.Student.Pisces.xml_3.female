But if you think about it...if somebody changes, could you really accept them for their true self after...or would it be too much?      i never knew the answer to that until now...It's amazing the things you learn as you grow...and you know, i've still got a lot to go before i get to where i want to be...and i'm  hoping ... praying ....that i will get there, along with my friends, the people i  love .              Awwwww.....Aren't we cute??? *grins*  And now.... Ladies and gents...Hold onto your shorts....Believe me when I say....this will be the   HOTTEST   thing you've ever seen!       Aw shoot!! Damn....Now if I was single.... *grins* Love ya hue!
