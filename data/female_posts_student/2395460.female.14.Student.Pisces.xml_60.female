A new study by  urlLink Clean Production Action  and  urlLink Computer Take Back  found neurotoxic chemicals in the dust of every computer included in their testing. The worst offender was PBDE(polybrominated diphenyl ether), which is a widely used flame retardant that has caused health problems in lab animals.

Becoming a Luddite is no solution, since the problem is global and unless you're prepared to create your own  urlLink biosphere , you're unlikely to escape PBDEs. One way to help directly is to  urlLink recycle your own electronics  and urge companies and your local and federal government to do it more of it as well. Spreading the word about PBDEs is crucial so that corporations will feel some pressure to start phasing out the use of these toxic chemicals.  Read more from  urlLink CNET .
