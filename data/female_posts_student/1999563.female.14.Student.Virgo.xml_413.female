Maybe I should put a hit counter on it..btu those are kinda cheesey. 200 people read my profile which is kinda creepy if you asl me. I wonder who reads it? I bet there are tons of random people who read my blog. I wonder if anyone from China reads it... My mom wnats me to make and apron for improv. Hah. WHy does everyone thign I am so handy? My mom is all like "Your the fashion person, make it!" I AM NOT A FASHION PERSON. I despice fashion with my very being. Everyone thinks I am all fashionable and I care alot about clothes but I don't. I wish people would stop thinking I am something I am not.   Ugh.... :)  For improv we must sell hot-dogs and hamburgers. I guess it will be fun...whenever I am around the Improv people I get really nervous becasue they are always always ALWAYS funny...I am not funny...I just like to observe everyone and not talk very much...all they do is talk and laugh. Whenever I am around them I feel inferior..  Now my mom is in a SUPER DUPER WOOPER bad mood and she is like "Go make an apron!"   Right.
