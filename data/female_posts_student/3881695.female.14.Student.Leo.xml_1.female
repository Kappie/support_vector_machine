I had to stay home, cause my mum went to work and my dog was totally dirty, she had obviously been digging outside and she got my Pj's dirty.  I'm trying to get over my cold, it have gotten worse since yesterday, it was prolly the rain or something. But, yeah. Im takin pills for it. So uhm....yeah.  I also took the National Life Expectancy test last night and it said I was only going to live until im 78, unless I change my life. Which is what im going to do, I might go on one of those non-eating diets, or just eat a healthy dinner and nothing else, then no one would notice. Yeah and I will excerise and stuff. Im also thinking about starting Hip Hop lessons, I did dancing from the age of 4 and stopped when I was 10. So I did it for a long time. I also did it for last year, but then I stopped again.  Well im talking to Dan on MSN so imma go now.  Signing out, Bridget!
