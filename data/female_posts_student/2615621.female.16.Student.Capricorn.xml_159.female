WE KNOW!! but hey, my middle name is KATHERINE, sound the same, spelled differently, just pretend shes my kinda "katherine". haha or even katies..hahahaha i could go on all day crackin catherine jokes. anyways, baby..im sorry. haha   I had a weird dream last nite and becuase i waited so long to write it all down, i cant remember all of it but here it is:  I was at the computer and danny had yahoo and he was talking to his cousin (the chick i recently added) and they were talking about me. and by this point in time i had already met danny and he said "man, i wish i could take her away and marry her and live here in VA, everything would be great" to his cousin and she copied it and pasted it to me.   DUDE how fucked up is that?! haha my mind is seriously not dreamin right! what ever happened to my dreams where i get to watch Bam Margera skate naked?! haha im JK. that's great...  I tried callin my mom today to tell her how im coming home early and how i lied to my dad so i wouldnt hurt his feelings. just so she can back up my lies incase they talk. hahaha i doubt they will though.   oooo yesterday i watched "2 punk rock 4 this" real world stuff and it was AWESOME i could have watched that ALLLLL day. another one called "the shit they should have shown" is coming on next tuesday..yays!! i cant wait, i love real world!
