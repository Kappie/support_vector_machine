Drew went to Kayla's church today. He really likes her alot... like ALOT alot. You can read about it  urlLink http://www.xanga.com/bmxpunks2000 there. And I feel so left out. Like we had this awesome conversation last night, well this morning really, and I thought it was going to get better. But not once did he mention me. It's all Kayla, Kayla, Kayla... I love Kayla, dont get me wrong. Iam justpissed at Drew.
