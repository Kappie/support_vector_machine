An hour ago I attempted to post something and the website gave me the run around.  On to more interesting things though. My jacket should be here tomorrow, or Friday, since it is still Wednesday. Anyway that jacket is the coolest fucking thing I have ever seen in my life.  Hopefully no one that talks with my mother is reading this right now, but, I don't really give a shit. I am drunk, and in about five minutes the whole world will know how much drinky drinky Ian took in. That's right, the list of hatred will be posted.
