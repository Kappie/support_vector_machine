So I turned in my first late assignment since starting at UCF tonight. It was due at midnight and I posted at 12:52. Sigh. I'm such a slacker. :)   urlLink Marie  and I spent the day discussing how much better we are than everyone else. I feel so bad for people that come into contact with us in the lab. We really are research bitches.  In an interview on CBS, Teresa Heinz Kerry (he could only be married to a hypocrite as big as himself!) was quoted as saying "I'm cheeky, I'm sexy, whatever."      urlLink     Such an intelligent and eloquent woman, isn't she? I want to know who in their right mind would find her sexy?! I think this would have been the more appropriate quote to accompany the picture...  "I'd like to be a dog," she says to a group of pre-schoolers. "Do you know why? Wouldn't you like to be a dog? I would. Dogs are friendly." Ah, honey, all that money, and look! Your wish came true!   See, sweetie, the problem is to be first lady, you actually have to be a lady!      urlLink      You go on being cheeky, there in your gas guzzling, party-switching house on the hill, Teresa.   Sorry, had to get that out of my system...  Tomorrow I have to write a 5 page paper on my expectations for Russia...Any thoughts? Do I include that I'm terrified and I don't want to go?  ~D~
