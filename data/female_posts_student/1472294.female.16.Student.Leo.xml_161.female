A lot of special effects, cannot really see what the action was about and what was going on. All I knew was that the Star Crossed Lovers were seperated at birth and they met again under very unfavourable conditions and vowed to stay together. Well, the starting point was very touching especially the lead actor talked about how love is all about and he hoped that he never met Xiao Qian before coz it would bring pain to both their hearts. ...>_ very fun * events in my school next week... -__________- (That is the longest frown I have ever made)
