I think I will start where I last left-off. On Sunday I woke up late and my mom said that we could go shopping if I wanted and get some pants, so I invited Brandon with us. I got 3 new pairs of pants and then we went into Nordstrom's and had some soup and then drove home. Brandon stayed and had some ribs with us and then we watched some TV and then he had to go home. On Monday I slept in and then I had to go to the Orthodontist, but they got things messed up so then they told me to come the next day. Afterwards I sat in the car while my mom was looking at the Library for books. Then my mom stopped at Albertson's, while I sat in the car. Then my mom went and took me to Perfect Ten and I got my acrylic nails taken off. The rest of the day I just layed around and talked with Brandon. On Tuesday I slept in again, and then I went to the Orthodontist and then came home and then I just stayed home and talked on the phone. On wednesday I was woken up at 9:00 because my dad said he wanted me to get up for no odd reason. I got ready and then I had to go to Costco with my mom and then afterwards we picked up Brandon. We went into Blockbuster while my mom went to Albertson's and we got Animal House and 13 Ghosts. We came home and then I made some campbell's soup for Brandon and then we watched Animal House. Afterwards we watched half of 13 Ghosts and then had to stop to have some dinner. We had the best food ever, Chinese food....we had a feast! We finished 13 Ghosts and then afterwards we watched Boat Trip. By this time it was about 10:00 and his mom came and picked him up. On Thursday was Turkey Day! I woke up around 8:30 for no odd reason, just to the fact that my dad wanted me up, again. I got ready, peeled 9 apples, and 10 lbs of potatoes, then talked on the phone. I had to entertain 8 family members from 3-9 and yea that's about it for that day. On Friday I was supposted to wake up at 8:00 so then we could go bargain shopping for day after Thanksgiving day. But, I woke up at 10, same as my mom. We got to the mall at 1 pm and headed straight for Abercrombie and Fitch. I got a sweatshirt, 4 longsleeve shirts, 1 short sleeve shirt, 1 pair of pants, and some perfume. We then went to Hollister and I got 3 longsleeve shirts. Afterwards we went to Nordstrom's and had some salad, afterwards at B.P. I got 1 longsleeve shirt and 2 turtlenecks. Then, I got this new cell phone cover that is blue kinda see through and has these Hawaiian flowers on it. I came home and was verrrrry tired. Brandon invited me over to watch Barber Shop so I brought some dessert over for him. On Saturday I did really nothing, just sat around. Now comes to today, today I woke up at 10 and then I did really nothing, again. I just watched TV and went on the phone and then I did my makeup homework for chem and then studied for some makeup quizzes. Now I'm on the phone with someone who I deeply love and is blasting his music because his parents aren't there. Well that was my Thanksgiving Break, one good break indeed. I really needed it cause I needed sleep and I needed to just RELAX. Hope that everyone else had an awesome break like I did. I can't wait till Christmas break. Driving class, snowboarding, family, ice skating, rollerblading, movies, Brandon, and who knows else?
