I felt like I had no place to go...Nowhere to hide and felt as if I had been left alone in the world...I wished for people who were true..People who really cared...Not just people who seemed to care...But really didn't...I was tired of being with hypocrites...Besides I had been having other problems and felt as if I had nowhere else to go....So it felt better if I could just disappear..Permanently..To just stop being...To cease with this unnecessary existence....To simply...Die.....And it felt like a good idea at the time....And yes I know the obvious questions.... didn't you ever think about those who love you??...What about your family...Your friends???? ...Well I did think 'bout them....But I they had decided to continue living it was their choice..And either ways they would continue living....With or without me....So I felt as if I didn't make a difference in their existence....If they kept living it was their problem....Wasn't mine...And if I had decided to stop...It was my problem then...So I was stuck with it...And I didn't want to have any more problems....So I just wanted to get away...And even though it seems stupid now..It felt right at the time...And it was decided...I was gonna kill myself....End the deal...And I did.... At first I thought about a gun...Fast and easy...But then again not that easy,...cuz...Where the hell could I find it???.....So I gave up  on that one.....And then there was the knife idea.....After the first cut no blood came out....Well not as much blood as I wanted...Well as I needed to die...So it didn't work either...Then pills...I took right about 100 pills...But that didn't work either...It just seems they made the effect they should....But for a VERY long time...They were sleeping pills...And I felt snoozie(or whatever) for like about a week or so...Then I realized I hadn't been snoozie...Or sleepy...I had achieved my goal...I had died...I had ceased this existence..I wasn't there anymore....That's when I realized it wasn't worth it...That suicide wasn't worth the trouble..That everyone had problems....But tried to make them better...Not ran away like I did..And I regret it....Deeply...I got a chance to know how my loved ones were...How they reacted when they saw me dead...I had emotionally destroyed my family....My friends felt as if it had been their fault...And I tried to talk to them.....I tried to tell them. It hadn't been because of them...I was just not good at that time..And that I felt sorry.....But sorry didn't make it any better.....Sorry couldn't bring me back to life....cuz there was nowhere back from where I was...At was in the middle....Not in the beginning neither in the end...I was stuck in the middle because of my decision....Of that terrible decision...A decision that had marked my life...Well not my life...But my destiny...My happiness..happiness that had faded away...That had left my side...Like had left my loved ones' side..I was there I saw them...But they didn't see me they didn't feel my presence...But here I still stay...Stuck.....Confused...Living in my sorrow....Living in pain....Watching how everyone went on with their lives...And I didn't...And now it remains as my problem...But unlike the ones I had when alive this one can not get better...
