After he got home from school today, he did his homework, I was typing a report, it seemed like any other day (except most of the time he comes in screaming and all hyper-like, I like the quiet so I didn't question it). Then he got the bright idea of playing his recorder. In the kitchen. Which he has known to be against house rules since I started band in fifth grade. Me, being the easily irratable person I am, step in and tell him to take his musical mojo elsewhere. And, big suprise, we fight, he winds up overreacting like the drama queen he is and cries.  Then it hit me: I was going to go to Dave's tomorrow, so if I want to keep my ass from getting grounded, I'd have to fix it, and fast. Running out of ideas, I suck up my pride through a straw and apologize. Sincerely. Well, enough to fool him anyway. He's gullable like that. Anywho, it turns out he had a super-crappy day, bullies and such, and we both wind up crying on the kitchen floor. Ok, I wasn't crying, but I felt like crying. Sorry for having a heart of stone. But the bottom line is that I know what it's like to be bullied in school. (Off topic: anyone notice how it's bullying in elementary school but it's harassment in middle and high school? it just occured to me...)  So after a long discussion on what he had done and what he should do about it, I take a stroll down memory lane, pa comes home and voila! I'm saved from Grounded City. And then Zack defended me from pa about something, I don't know.... but it seemed like he really cared.  I guess it was bad since I was only trying to keep myself from getting grounded, but hey, it's a win-win situation. And for once my brother shows that he cares.
