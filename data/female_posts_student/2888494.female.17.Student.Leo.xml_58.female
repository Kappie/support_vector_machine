How wise I am.  So... Joan Jett and the Blackhearts- bad reputation. Best song ever. Today I submitted my first two lessons to BYU distance learning. In the comment box I wrote "purple monkey dishwasher. Yippee!". I hope they have to document and catalog every comment they get. Muwhahahaha....  Elisse is going to stop smoking. Huzzah! Save the lungs!  I have to go memorize my lines. Stupid lines. Stupid play.
