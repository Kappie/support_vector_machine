I got 5 tanks woohoo. Not much yaknow but its something. Then I came home and sat outside and played basketball for awhile. I thought I was getting tan...but I got really burnt. Woops. Oh well...atleast I have some color to me now...And my hair is getting blonder too which makes me happy. So yeah thats all I did yesterday...  Today has been really boring! There is nothing to do. If it wasnt so windy I could sit outside but no...Eh. Its gay. So My mom and I have been cleaning the backroom all day so hopefully we can make it into my lil room n stuff. So i'll actually have a place for friends...like I ever have friends over...HA! but yeah...a place for me...so yeah...I guess nothing else is going on........  -Tara
