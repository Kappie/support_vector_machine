I have been computerless for a few months now, and it's good to be back online!   I am adding some new stuff to my site, including a gallery with links to some of my friend's sites . . . If you'd like to be included, just send me an e-mail including a link to your site.   I've been working on something that has been fun for me. I am painting my room. I've already gotten the annoying roller painting out of the way and i am in the midst of painting various designs all around me. It's fun because it's abstract . . . i'll include some pics of my room on here when i have completed it . . .   I'm working on a new novel. It is a completely new genre for me and so it has remained interesting. I'm also working toward getting some of my children's books published. Cross your fingers for me :)
