This weekend the explorers are going to help out with relay for life. To tell the truth i volenteered so i could watch one of the preps from school fall and hurt themselves! Drew: You did not hear that though.... I swear I'm a good lil girl! *Whatever* Over the last few weeks we have been having fun at meetings. Drew bought this shocking game and let us play it. *Forgive the product placement* You can buy it at spencers. It has a red light that blinks and you hold a button. The light flashes and needs new music! when it turns green you push your button fast. Yes i got shocked a few times cause of my bf. Oh well... I'm just relived the army didn't find the dead body *JK*
