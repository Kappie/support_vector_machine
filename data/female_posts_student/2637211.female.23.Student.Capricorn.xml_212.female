I was glad to show Liz the Rockridge neighborhood and take her to Christopher's, which is like the only place I ever eat cheeseburgers. Organic beef, you know. Very tasty, especially when hungry.  Last night I did my own thing, I watched a little  urlLink Adult Swim , and watched some other lame television. I think I even caught an episode of  urlLink Trading Spaces  that I hadn't seen before. Then I crashed, probably staying up later then I needed too. A nice time, though. I forget how much I like my own company late at night. I had to be quiet though, because Lisa was sleeping, but that wasn't so bad, because I'm usually awfully quiet late at night.  So, I slept in, had weird dreams about being at fair and trying to keep a baby rattle snake from biting people at Renaissance Faire, then having to save the chickens from being eaten by a cat, all this after being squirted in the face with liquid LSD. A strange dream, I know. I woke up as my dad was trying to get us a better camp situation at the faire. It's refreshing to wake up when my body is just done sleeping. Then I had some coffee, IMed with my sister, and Melissa dropped by because she had a brunch in my complex. Then I called Alex, and we talked for 45 minutes, which was nice. Now I'm putting off reading, but I better get back to it, I have to present it tomorrow in class. I'm more ahead on my reading than I normally am on Sunday afternoon, so I'm a bit complacent.
