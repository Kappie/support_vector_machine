I will NEVER LIKE him.. NEVER! He's one of those guys which I classify OUT OF MY LIST! Goodness I don't even talk to him.. HOW ON EARTH WOULD I LIKE HIM... he also loves to make noise in class.. like nobody's business  attracts attention. Coz during the break time.. Charlene, Michelle, Siew Ting  me went out to eat at clementi central area... after which we went to Mac to use the toilet. And... DOTS... the freaky group of guys were there.. SICKENING enough they started doing their USUAL BUSINESS AGAIN... Ok I didn't go to school today.. kinda good coz I don't hafta face those irritating guys.. immatured ones....and the fact that I'm sick makes my temper worst... today's chinese new year eve  I wonder how about tomorow if I'm still sick...
