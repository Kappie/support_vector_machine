She used to say she's content knowing I'm in her life...  Now, She said she can't see herself being with me anymore... Now, She said I keep reminding her of her mistakes... Now, She said she can't live her life with me... and  Now, She said she can't move on if I'm in her life...  How does a person learn to accept that?  How does a person keep her/his self-dignity if its been crushed like that? How does a person learn to respect her/himself if the only person s/he's ever loved has said those things to her?    Everyone keeps saying LET IT GO... to just take the plunge and let go. They say that it would hurt for a while trying to get used to it... time heals all wounds.  But how can a wound so deep within your soul heal with time? Its hard when you have to smile or laugh and be hurting so much inside.  Its so hard to hide your tears and pretend as if everything is fine.  But for now that's all you can do.. hide and pretend.
