The only thing that I've found out today was how much of a jerk evan really is...if you don't know what i'm talking about, oh well, you'll probably end up finding out anyway...eventually. Well, i guess that's all fortoday. Hope y'all have fun at band next week...mwahahahahaha...cuz i'm not gonna behere. Just knowthatI'll miss you all. lol    Like a fat girl in dodge-ball, I'm out.    ~Caitlin*      2 days til camp Y
