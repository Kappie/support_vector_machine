WHAT WAS THAT? Oh. God. Going to kill Emily. We just watched The Ring, see. I’m the type of person who can’t watch Jurassic Park  without seriously freaking out. They’re saying we’re about to watch South Park. Never seen it. Mum totally objects.  3:16 am  South Park was very good. Very funny. Very, very, VERY rated R. Must remind friends NOT TO MENTION the movie in front of mum. The Ring, too, ‘cause it was definelty rated R also.  No way. I just looked at the case. Rated PG-13. The ratings board were on crack when they watched this. The Ring is so incredibly R that it’s not even funny.  Extremely sleepy. But they want to watch Spirited Away. Either that or Gothika. Must convince them to watch Spirited Away. I don’t think I could handle any more horror.
