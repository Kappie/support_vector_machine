The damn hospital has got me working freakin midnights (11 pm to 7 am) and I find myself having mixed emotions about it.  I dont mind working these hours, but I dont really like getting to sleep at 8 am in the morning.  The people I work with are cool. Thank god it's Spring Break....after I take my Physics final in a few hours.
