Hehe we also found a really stupid one of my brother sitting a toy car with his hair sticking up like a pineapple! And after all this time he hasn't changed a bit! Then we found some other photos...of my Nan...my Grandma and my old cat. We're lucky for the time that we have. Mmm, don't worry, I wrote in my diary last night so you're free from moral ramblings! Oh great, school tomorrow. :(
