Everything just totally seems to be getting so much better and I couldn't be happier. I love him so much. We've talked about everything and last night he was reading a note I wrote him and he started crying because it was saying how much I loved him, and he feels like he hasn't been treating me right and he doesn't want to lose me because I am the best thing that happened to him and he's just scared that I'm going to leave him, but I reassured him that everything was fine and I WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIM!!!!!! I love our relationship, we talk and we understand each other. I can't want to marry him!!!!  But on a sadder note, my friend Sean, went into a diabetic seizure on Tuesday night because he took 13 triple c's smoked weed and coke. Yeah, pretty dumb but he's alright now. Dusty and John got caught too but their parents weren't notified. John and Dusty and Danny can never hang out with Sean again. I just hope everyone learned a lesson from this. Danny and Sean say there done with everything, John wasn't even on anything he was just there, and Dusty said he's just never doing coke again. Yeah, we all had a little scare there, but now everythings good.  Well I have to go clean my room. Love ya'll!! ~*CaSeY*~   ***When you love someone all your saved up wishes start coming out***
