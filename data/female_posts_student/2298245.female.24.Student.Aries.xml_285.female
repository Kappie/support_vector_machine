Last night, I did something that I haven't done in a very long time.  As I was lying in bed, this overwhelming feeling of dread and anxiety began to fill my stomach.  My heart started to pound very fast, and I felt genuinely scared.  So, for some strange reason, I said aloud, "I'm sorry, but this is something I have to do," and I got out of bed, knelt next to my bed, and began to pray, prostrate over my bed and before God.    It's not that I don't ever pray, it's just that I've never been very good at prayer unless there was some sort of external crisis going on, like sick relatives or problems with friends.  I've always prayed for other people, but never really for myself.  This might seem strange to some, and it certainly seems strange to me.  I've always thought of myself as a Christian - certainly not the best or more pious out there, but it's something that I've rarely questioned.  But I guess that was the problem - sometimes, I think it's easier for people who aren't brought up religiously, who come to it on their own, because it somehow means more to them.  Me, it was always something that was a part of my life - so I think I've taken it for granted.  Only recently did I think I really understand for the first time how awesome a power and force it could be in my life.  And I think it all finally came home to me last night.  For the first time when I was having a personal, internal problem and conflict, it occurred to me to actually ask God for help.    So I got out of bed, down on my knees, and began to pray.  And I cried as I did.  I cried at the simplicity of this action, at my own stupidity and ungratefulness, for my complete ignorance in not realizing this thing was before me.  I prayed for a while, falling upon great moments of silence as I fumbled through unfamiliar ground, ground that shouldn't have been unfamiliar to me at all.  And after I was done, I felt the most amazing feeling of peace.  I don't honestly think I've ever felt like that before.  I asked for God's help, and for once, I didn't feel weak doing so - or, more accurately, I did feel weak but I realized that it was okay, that it was the whole point.  I am weak.  I am weak and I need help and I shouldn't be afraid or ashamed to ask for it.  I had asked God to calm my mind, and when I got back into bed, I found that it was calm.  It still took me a while to get to sleep - as it always does - but the thoughts running though my mind were not harried thoughts of the millions of things I had to get done and hadn't.  They were pleasant thoughts, silly thoughts, thoughts completely mundane, or dreams of things I still long to accomplish.  But the stress was not there, the agonizing over how I am going to get through another day, of the piles of things that went undone as I fritted away my time this weekend, just like every other weekend.  These thoughts were nowhere to be found.  I woke up tired, but not plagued with doubt and dread about starting another week.    I do not want you to think that these thoughts are all I have been having.  It is indeed the rare occurrence (usually Sunday nights, when I am at my most stressed and unhappy now that the relaxation of the weekend has passed and another week of things to do is upon me), but when it has happened before, I've not had any recourse but to lay there staring at the ceiling, doing nothing, hoping for it to pass from me so that I could get to sleep, since no one likes to face Monday tired as well as grumpy.   But last night I fought back, fought back against the force of woe with the only weapon I have, the only one I know, and the only one truly strong enough to fight.  My faith took an enormous leap last night.  It may be too soon to say that my life has changed - but at the same time, I don't think it is too soon, because any further acceptance and recognition of God's love and power has to be an important occurrence in one's life, certainly more important than the trifling deadlines and pesky classes and general duties of my existence.  This morning I came to school really happy, really charged and ready to be here, even though I was majorly unprepared for my classes and dreadfully behind in many things.  And I haven't felt like that...well, ever that I can remember in my existence.  So I think that it is something...something big and exciting and unforgettable.    I already owed God so much.  And now I owe Him a little bit more for proving Himself to me when it was unnecessary for Him to do so.  I cannot repay the debt, that is for sure - but at least I can make it worthwhile.  I can make it mean something.  And from now on, I will try to do my best to do so.  I may often fail, but I've no doubt that, in the end, I will succeed, flourish, and prosper.
