Everyone had fun though, especially the kids who had their birthday party in the afternoon of Saturday. I wasn't there to witness it though since i had a meeting with the LECTORS' MINISTRY. Our meeting was so long, and stated another load of work for me as I am the secretary.  When I got home around 4:30 in the afternoon, the children's party was just about finish. And all i got were kisses from all of my pamangkins, and glad to see most of my cousins with their own toddlers. Kinda reminded me of some of my ideas of late.   Anyway, my pamangkins were so full of stories...(from all their gifts), and non-stop babbling about their games and their prizes. Their enthusiasm was infectious, it made me forget that my back's really aching and my hip throbbed from the badminton game I had earlier in school. Having them around made me re-think about some goals in life.   Well, the farewell party for Father Dennis started about 7:30. And as usual, Allan E. stole everyone's attention with his glittering "do" ala Celia Rodriguez...even Father Dennis was rendered speechless. Some pictures are due soon, and i'll leave the judging to all of you.  Even when my whole body's screaming for rest, songs from Ma's choir helped ease the tension. "Bisayan" kundiman managed to make my day, and reminded me of the times i spent with my Lola in the farm.   Oh well, it was a superb party with all the superb people, and a comfortable time where everybody enjoyed each other's company.  Father Dennis, bon voyage, good luck...and do well with your "pearly shells"...wait for me. And when you visit Grand Kapalua Hotel, please don't forget to send pictures. We'll surely miss you.
