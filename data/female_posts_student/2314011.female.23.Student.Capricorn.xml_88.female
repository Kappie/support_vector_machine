       
      An angry email, an angry-turned-to-revelations hurried conversation and finally a conversation full of open, honest communication later, I think we're doing just fine.  It always does the trick.    "So, you wanna get a room Friday?"  "Sure."  That helps, too.  And, as promised, today's the year anniversary of a great, great day in the lives of two young (and not so young) people and a few celebrities on the side.   Tuesday, January 7    In the morning, I dressed for the theater.  The plan was to spend the day in museums and the evening enjoying Rent.    "Looks like it"s just gonna be me and you today."  I looked up from my Corn Flakes/Bran Flakes/Rice Krispies mix, questioning, trying not to look as excited as I was.  "Grant's not feeling too great, so he's going to stay here and rest."  "So I guess I better change, huh?"  On the Tube heading into the city, a thought occurred to me.  "How long is that Gillian play going to be here?"  "'Til February, why?"  "Well, I'd really like to see something I can only see here, you know?  I can see Rent in Spokane whenever I want."  "That would be really great, actually.  Grant doesn't care to see it and you didn't say anything when I mentioned it before, so I just figured I'd miss it."  "Well, let's not do that anymore, k?  Let's get tickets for tonight and just do it."  "Super!"  After a stop at Starbucks and a chuckle about Virginia Woolf's Burgers, Pastas, and Grills restaurant, we made our way to the British Museum.    The museum is the center of  the literary district of Bloomsbury, and has served as a haven for all kinds of hippies and communists, from Gandhi to Karl Marx, to George Orwell, Charles Dickens, and Virginia herself.  They all holed up (not necessarily at the same time) in the giant reading room at the museum; their names, and those of other such strangers, inscribed on the walls of the library bring the history of the establishment and the city home in a way dry historical facts and dates just can't.    The distinct aroma of the city does the same thing. The air is rich and full there.  Full of industry, food, busy people, history and life.  It's immediately noticed, quickly adapted to, and eventually missed.  It goes quite well with coffee and perspiration, the kind one accumulates after walking all over hell and back every day for a week.   "I'm getting the feeling that there's no way we're going to get through all there is to see here, so just show me the highlights."  "Oh, don't worry," he said over his shoulder.  First was the Egyptian halls, filled with statues, relics and sarcophaguses from centuries past.  The shadowy sense of the city's life that whispered to me from the beginning solidified as I ran my fingers across the bottom of 3,000 year old works.  The day before, we admired portraits painted during the 1400s, now we were standing in front of products of 1400 BC.  We were standing in a hall of legends, surrounded by gods and kings, and talking to each other felt like an interruption of whatever wisdom they were imparting to us.  In hushed whispers:  "Over here's the Rosetta Stone."  "Oh really?  Kick ass!"  Pause.  "Remind me again of the importance?"  "Well, when the explorers came to Egypt, this is what they used to translate the markings in the pyramids and such.  There are three different languages written on it, so when they found this, they knew how to read Egyptian writing."  "Oh, right.  I get it now."  "Wanna check out some Greek stuff?"  Panels and statues from the Parthenon in Athens lined the walls, and my appreciation for the Greeks was sufficiently renewed.  We were finally shooed away from mummified bodies, pets, internal organs and food as the museum's closing time quickly approached.    With an hour to spare before the play, we searched for a quick dinner back in Leicester Square.  The screams of the crowd alerted Levi to the lights and posters.  "Oh, this is the 'Gangs of New York' premiere," again with the "this happens all the time over here tone."  Not truly expecting anything grand, we made our way over, just for the sake of gawking.  But as more time passed, the more real the idea became that we might actually see someone.  Accordingly, we forfeited our dinner and found a space, mashed against fellow onlookers, trying to conserve heat on the blustery winter night, waiting for important cars to arrive.  First was Harvey Weinstein, looking like Jabba the Hut, in true Hollywood fashion-cell phone in hand and all.    Martin Scorsese arrived with very little bombast, in a mini-van, no less.  The next recognizable star was Daniel Day-Lewis.  Now we were down to two, only caring about one.  "We can leave when Cameron gets here, really."  We watched as the clock ticked closer and closer to 7.  "We need to leave by 7:10, and that's all there is to it," his voice of reason declared.  "Jesus, I can't feel my fingers."  As the tension mounted and cars pulled in, the crowd was sure this was her.  It had to be.  As I readied my camera lens, I listened carefully to catch the person's identity.  Finally, I heard his chuckling voice behind me:  "Oh ... It's Joan Collins."  "What the hell is Joan Collins doing here?  Acting like this is her damn movie?"  The next round of cars arrived quickly and suddenly Leo was there, in a mob of other men in suits, looking more gorgeous than he had any right to.  It quickly became apparent that Cameron was a lost cause, so we headed to the theater and Gillian.  Arriving in time to buy the essentials: chips, water, poster and program, we brushed by glamorous, sophisticated, important-looking people and claimed our discount sixth row seats.   I'm so glad I changed out of my fancy, theater-going clothes this morning.   The show itself was quite phenomenal, living up to the hype of the day, and the evening's entertainment breezed by in what felt like a few minutes.  As we gathered our bearings outside, preparing for the journey home, he noticed the line.  As we took our place, the man announced:  "It'll be just a minute; here's the deal: One item per person and nothing from the 'X-files.'"  After a few good gasps and jokes, and before the enormity really hit us, the line began moving toward the small redhead in the doorway.  She seemed really exhausted, but still gracious when forced to endure bad play-referencing jokes made by star-struck American strangers.   And it's only Tuesday!  If everything had gone according to plan, I'd be flying back tomorrow, and I doubt we would've spent this evening out on the town.   Yay.  Told you it would be good.    And just out of sheer randomness and end/beginning of the year shit I'm a week late for, here's a list of all the books I read during 2003:  The Truth Is... Melissa Etheridge's Autobiography: B+ (I had to have something to take my mind off the fact I wasn't yet in London, thanks to the fucking Passport people!)
