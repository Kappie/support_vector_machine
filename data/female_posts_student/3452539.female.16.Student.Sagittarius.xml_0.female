I woke up with an attitude that reminded me of my english teacher this morning.  "I do not know how much I could ever trust a thing that bleeds nearly immensely for several days straight and does not die..." -James Francoeur in regards to females...yes...my english teacher said this to our class. I do not know where he got it from, but it came to mind and got me to laugh a bit this morning.  Now that you are a bit freaked out...the parades went well and once more Engineer Dave teased me about being the only female. The candy cannon worked well too. It allowed us to demonstrate that there are two different forms of "Ah"  There is the one which is amazed, such as: Ohhh, Ahhh, look at the fireworks!  And there is one which is terrified, such as: AH!!! HOLY SHIT WHAT WAS THAT?!?!?!?!  Both were heard today. About three people got hit in the head by candy. We started saying "Heads up" and all people would do was look up just to get konked. Or they would be like, "Why heads up?"   clunk  , "Oh."  No rain! Beautiful day...a bit buggy though.   lol, we had to use my dad's truck battery in our cart...sucker...lol.   Nah, just messing. It was a lot of fun today.  Daaang, I need to clean.  Have a good day!  -J9
