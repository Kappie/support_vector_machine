I got to go swinging YAY(actually it was reallyfun ;) ). And i am sorryI broke down on ya on the phone. As you said it was knew to me. And just to let you when you say you always have to put on a front. I really do know how you feel. And i understand cause i've been doing that for almost my hole life. And yeah my parents aint exactly good together and my life aint all that. It may not be anything like yours but we have a lot of our ups and downs too. It just ended up showing last night. I'm not trying to compare lives or anything i'm just saying you can talk to me about it and i may not fully understand but i will still listen and try to understand as much as I can. (( god please help Jessica, KDand I we are having some troubles. Give Jessica strengh to hold on. And Give Kd strengh to get out of there.)) Jessica thanks for saying that you are always there for me. Cause honostly i will also always be here for you! I love you girl. I love you too Kd even though your not here to see that i still do.   Okay i'm getting a lil mushy. But hey sometimes it's good to let it all out. PEACE, Kristine
