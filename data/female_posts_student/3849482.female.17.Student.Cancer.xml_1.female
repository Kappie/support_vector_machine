It's ironic how something as simple as a zodiac sign can tell someone everything they want to know about me, even the characteristics I try to hide the most.  I have low self esteem, but I wonder if other people see that as me being snobby instead.  If that is how others view me, I wish they wouldn't... but I cannot blame them because I am sure that I mistake the insecuritiy of others as over-confidence, as dumb as it may sound.  Although I'm sure that being a Cancer has nothing to do with it, the reason for my low self esteem actually is body image.  I'm in a fat mood as I often am- it's not a great feeling if you know what mood I am referring to.  I eat when I'm not hungry and I am angry with myself because I do.  I know I'm not "fat" per se, but I do have this strange inborn fear of gaining too much weight.  When I was little, I read that Cancers were supposed to have a love of food, and ever since then, I've been self conscious.  I guess this may explain a lot to some people.  I do not like sounding so superficial though.  *sighs*  I can't explain it.  In ninth grade, I did a project on eating disorders.  People with anorexia had so many symptoms that reminded me of myself.  They were people who obviously were not happy with themselves, were usually overachievers with this need to please others.  Because they felt that weight was one of the few things they could control, however, they decided to focus on being the skinniest or lightest for themselves rather than for others.  Don't worry, I know that I am not anorexic nor will ever be anorexic... unless it is merely a state of mind, in which case, I should be considered one. *ponders*  Well, anyway, I am planning on losing weight while staying healthy at the same time.  ^_^
