I just love Flora with Moses so much!!! hahahaa...Going to put this picture as the wallpaper on all of my computers.       I had made a new resolution. Today onwards until end of September, I will try not to read Flora's news or surf any of her websites so that I can concentrate on my work first. I had even cleaned the bedroom this morning (need to have a new start to everything).   Hope I will be able to keep this resolution.    Oh yes, I managed to find the  DIGITAL FORTRESS  by Dan Brown today. Going to read it soon. Hahahahaa.. I think I will like this book as much as Da Vinci Code too.
