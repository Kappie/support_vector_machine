One of those weekends that really made life a little bit easier. Well here goes..  I guess you can say it officially started Friday morning. It was a flex day, so in my opinion that kind of ties into the weekend. I really love flex days. It's so great to be in school, but not be in "school". Sometimes you just need a change, something out of the norm, and flex days (no matter how stupid some people think they are) usually provide that for me. This one in particular was pretty good. The whole "How to math" thing was actually fun.....although to my dissapointment I didn't learn how math was a verb. But anyways the thought of teaching kids and maybe having an impact on their lives kind of cheers me up. Just something to look forward too...... Well in the afternoon I had the building as text walk. Now seeing as how I had this in the afternoon I got the chance to talk to a lot of people that had it before me. Everyone I talked to said the same thing....."It was so boring and stupid", "it was pointless and tiring", well anyways of course I went into it thinking it was going to be just that, pointless and tiring. But much to my surprise I found it pretty interesting. I mean we are pretty lucky to live in such a historical area, and the fact that we got to go out and experience and take a look at the actual history (which I soon learned I knew little about) was pretty cool in my mind. Nice job teach.....  Later that afternoon I went to the Southeast Raleigh Homecoming game. I went into this thoroughly excited. I had never been to a real high school football game, and imagined it being just like the movies. Well much to my dismay I came out there quite different as I went in. That night I experienced: overwhelming crowds, (yes worse than the freshman mobs) a numerous amount of fights..... i mean full out beat the crap outa people fights, and I also realized that nobody seemed to include everyone. I mean everyone was hanging out with their close friends and that's it. There were distinguished "groups", and it kind of reminded me of middle school.   Well out of all that I realized that Raleigh Charter High School really isn't that bad. It's a good environment, and I needed an eye-opener like that game to help me realize it. I can really appreciate knowing everyone now, and I can clearly see that we really are accepting to everyone, and i like that.   All that and I'm only on Friday. Well on to Saturday..........  On Saturday me and Angela went over to the RLT ampitheatre. You may ask why we do this, and I myself can't really explain this, but in a couple of words.....it's fun to play on. Well anyways we went over to the stage and we came to realize that there was a wedding going on in the rosegarden. Well of course we couldn't be too loud during the wedding so we resorted to just kinda sitting and hiding from the wedding people-who kept looking at us weird. Since we couldn't make noise we decided to go see if Tom was home. Well he wasn't so we went to Hillsburough street and walked around....... You know I just love college campuses, there are so many interesting people......... Well anyways we went to I love NY pizza (the BEST pizza place in Raleigh) and came to discover that their pizza is only $1.60 and like 3 times bigger than the ones we get served at school!!!!! This both kind of angered us, it's not fair. But that's besides the point because we THEN went BACK to RLT and played some more, the wedding people still being there. They were just taking pictures though so we managed to stay out of their way. And I learned how to SKATEBOARD!!!......... Next we decided to call Noah and do something with him, so we all 3 went to Baskin Robbins. Geoff, Alyson and Jen were also there so we all ate together. It was great fun. Great great fun. Then they had to go. And I must say, I miss Noah...... Ok well then we left and went BACK to RLT (yes a 3rd time), and this time we got the stage to ourself. It was great fun. Our theatrical debut went quite well I must say. You know you feel really free on such a stage. Well it woulda been even more fun if these 3 freaky girls didn't come by and just watch us, so we went in the rosegarden and just sat down in the grass (very springy grass) and did nothing. You know, I've forgotten how nice it is to just do nothing except enjoy the outdoors. It really cleared my mind, and I think it was really beneficial to me. Definitely something I need to do again......just sit back and smell the roses. ( I think that's how that saying goes)  Yes Saturday was definitely a good day.  Sunday was good too. It consisted of shopping, and spending time with the gram and the mom. Good stuff. I would elaborate, but the fingers are getting tired.  All in all, it was a damn good weekend.
