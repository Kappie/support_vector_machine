Mmm... nothing to do... how am I supposed to do homework with this head! Err... hey no insulting me! I mean what's inside *nothing* it hurts, whatever it is! Wow... IT sounds like a load of fun *ZZZZZ* but then again, it is short course, forced IT what do you expect? Oh well... Yeay! Some one else feels like a chopping board! IT'S THE DAMN SCHOOL ... WEAR *hehe.. just forgot the proper name... wait a minute... who am I?* Nope, haven't spaced out that much yet!
