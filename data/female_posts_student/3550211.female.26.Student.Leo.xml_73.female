While it's unclear which song will make it to the airwaves first, folks who have heard at least one produced track describe Hilton's sound as "old Blondie, not Britney Spears at all."   Those who know Hilton only from her Fox reality show and her dip into porn-video experimentation shouldn't count the glam girl out, said one source. People who have stumbled upon listening sessions already can't believe it's Hilton belting out a tune. "No way," said one shocked listener. "It sounds pretty good."   Paris Hilton has named her debut CD "Screwed?!" Freakin' brilliant. Have fun doing a Google search for info on that disc.  And how much you wanna bet that the "shocked listener" who said the CD sounded "pretty good" was also a co-star on "The Simple Life?" I'm thinking it's Tinkerbell, (since we all know Nicole Richie can't string a coherent sentence together).  I also heard that Heiress Records is accepting demos, but they're only taking 12 inches right now. (ba-doomp-boomp)
