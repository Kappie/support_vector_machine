Ashlyn, Erin, Amanda, Codi, John, and I. It was fun! I finished 1984 last week (well 2 weeks ago) Now I'm half way through Stephen Kind's "It" ;) Sorta I was sick on Tuesday and Wednesday so all I did was read. On Sunday all I did was read as well. Seniors are gone now. It's rather sad. Well in some ways it's good in others it's bad. I have just became pretty good friends with some seniors. 8 days of school left! Wednesday before school I have to go in and take a math test. Tuesday before and after school I have to take skills tests. I have to pass them. I have an 87.5% in Biology =) Suzy and I made a list of people that we want to do random things with before summer is over, I got one of them done last night! uh oh I forgot to grab the lighter fliud bottle. I'll have Codi bring it to me on Tuesday. The coast guards told my dad that a tall girl with long brown hair and two other girls were sitting on the side of the road. Oh and she was wearing grey sweats... yeah I was wearing grey sweats, cute isn't it? I don't think so because it wasn't me! RAWR. 1984 is a very screwed up book. It really makes you think. The government could someday become this controlling! Today I've eaten a breakfast burrito and a bar of schocolate and it's not midnight. My dad and Bonnie only caught two crabs. Wow to think that they spent around four hours crabbing. Crazy. My dog smells like flee dip. Next week should be awesome! Other than math finals... Felicia and I can hang out hard core! Anthony's school year is over and Sarah will be gone... some where... not sure where though. I don't really care. Sierra yelled at her in PE class, it was funny. I think I'll go eat something now. Ciao
