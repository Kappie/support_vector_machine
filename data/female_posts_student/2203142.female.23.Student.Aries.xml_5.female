Am I blind to see that there's something there behind your eyes And it's bringing me to my knees. All I want is you and I don't care All I want is you and I don't care Cause all I do is wait in,  wondering and hoping,  that we'll survive it. I know that all this is true. All because of you. Something's wrong with you, The walls you build around you now, Seem to fit you like a glove. Something's wrong with you, Cause stars cannot be found in clouds that cover up their love. Cause all I do is wait in,  wondering and hoping,  that we'll survive it. I know that all this is true. All because of you.
