Just crushed that Brians moving soon..which brings up the breakup. Its really hard cuz i've never met anyone like him before..he's different..i'm scared someone else out there is going to find out how amazing he is..and i'll be out of luck..but there's nothing i can do about it..you can't make someone want you the way you want them..:(..hm..anywayz! new subject! I went w/ Ash to her Dr. appointment and then to her ultrasound!!! ITS A BOY! :) It was awesome to see the baby!!! It was moving around the whole time!! It took like 45 minutes..She gotta like 10 different pics to take home..They're soo cute! We've heard the heartbeat twice now! And then this morning i went to Winthrop with Em,Ciera, and Ciera's baby (Adrianna) to look at Em's senior pics..so i have a lotta anxiety about that too! woo-hoo. more shit to think about! I don't have anything planned for that...haven't picked the place, clothes, backgrounds or anything yet..really prepared,huh? oh well..yeah, tomorrow I'm getting my hair done so maybe that'll make me feel a lil better..who knows..Goin 2 the salon usually helps..I'm getting black chunks in my hair...my hair is already dark..so its not that drastic..maybe if i like it i'll go all black?! Its not like it really matters tho..
