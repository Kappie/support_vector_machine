I've been keeping busy the past two days or so, and now that no one's here, there's a prominent and reverberating echo that follows me everywhere.  To sum things up...most of that time was occupied by  THE VIDEO .  Yesterday we went to Bi-Lo, where we filmed us defiling a can of peanut butter and putting it back on the shelf, and then looking at condoms and attempting to buy some and make it embarrasing as possible, all the while on film! We were throw out thereafter, tho.   So, thus pissed, we went to some nearby shrubs and did some damage. Seth jumped into them once and smacked his skateboard into the curb and fell into them...I did a stagedive on them, face first, whereafter I rolled out the front and was witnessed by a couple 'o people, but no cops. So we didn't get arrested and that was great.  We also filmed other stuff...it's pretty gross and I won't go into detail. But it's not us streaking (yet) so don't worry about it.  At home, Seth and I designed the logos for this production, which is called SF, which stands for either ShitFiend or StupidFriends, depending on the audience. But moreover, it can stand for whatever you want it to. We just like ShitFiend.   We also wrote a parody of Good Charlotte's  The Anthem  and a song making fun of Star Wars with an awesome porn music background. w00t w00t.  And THEN...it was the next morning, and battling a lot of rain, we managed to get Alex and Brooks over here. There were many preliminary stunts with fire...LOTS of stuff is flammable. Seth's hand, basketballs, his skateboard, the ground...if it was burnable, we burned it :) It was amazingly fun to watch; moreover it was a middle finger to the age old cliché "play with fire and you get burned".  I  didn't get burned so HAH. Well, at least at this moment in the story.  Then, we had Brooks ride down the driveway on a scooter and got Alex to pelt him with a basketball. He had some impressive wounding from hitting the agregate. Alex did it to and we filmed it from a downhill perspective, with me, my sister, Brooks, and Seth throwing balls at him. He was also injured by this encounter tho not as much because he stuck to the grass. Mostly it was that getting hit in the head really hard part that made him wail.   AND THEN THE FIREWORKS. I had one more left in my house so we used that...I donned a new pair of jeans and took it in the right pocket, or so dictates tradition. We got it on film...it looks like I'm getting shot in the ass. I could watch it all day and never get tired of it. There's also the aftermath of me being on fire, where I take the hose and put myself out.   We later went to Brooks's house and got his MASSIVE box of fireworks. I said (very foolishly) that I would take ten in the back pockets. They argued my will to six, deeming me much too insane and wanting to preserve the lower part of my body for motor purposes...wheelchairs, people, wheelchairs, but they didn't listen...SO. Three in each pocket. Surprisingly they all lit and exploded...that it truly an assorted rarity in bunching bottlerockets.   Then, Alex threw one at me and it landed in my back pocket somehow...when it went off it streaked down to my ankle and blew.  And by the way...not any of that caused the burn.  The burn came from the last one. I told Brooks to give me one for the road and I filmed it myself. I don't know why but that one pwned me. I got a bit burnt so ouch. But it was all in the name of fun so "smile all" to quote Rosie.   And remember, if I die, I die smiling, and that's what matters.  We also have some really awesome footage of me and Alex performing  Master of Puppets  and  Freedom . Seth is a pretty wykd fotographer.   Anyway kids...that's about it. Just thought I would give an update and tell everyone how dumb I'm being so the rest of you can feel that much smarter.  Peace.
