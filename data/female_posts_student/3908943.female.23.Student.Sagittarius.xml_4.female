I realized then that I won't get to do that very often soon since I won't be coming back here after college (no matter what happens).  It made me sad because I know I won't get to see my family as much.  Decatur - I can leave with no problems.  But I will miss my family and the few friends I have left here.     I've been to some of the most wonderful places in the world: New York City, London, Munich, Paris, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta, Orlando, Philadelphia, etc.  I've gone to places that are 100's if not 1000's of years old, met people from all over the world, been to 8 different countries and 25 states.  I've been on the snow-capped mountains, in huge fields of flowers, swimming in the Caribbean, places where there are waterfalls all around you, cave diving in some of the largest caves in the country, kickin it with friends in Disney World for over a week, and standing in the middle of Times Square. I've stood where monarchs, politcians, famous composers, inventors, and even ancient Romans have been.  After seeing all that, you can see why I won't miss Decatur at all.  Maybe this explains why I'm easily bored though sometimes.    But I am by no means done travelling.  One of my friends told me that this was probably the happiest they had ever seen me, when I'm travelling.  Guess its no secret that I'm not a person to stay put.  There are so many places I still want to go and see: California, Alaska, Australia, Italy, Greece, the pyramids of Egypt, New Zealand, western Mexico, Spain, the Virgin Islands.  Hopefully I'll get to see it all someday.  And I can't wait till the day I can go back to London - not only to see my family, but to actually appreciate the things I see this time.  It truly is one of my most favorite places (if not the most) to visit that I have ever been to.
