I learned that more than half of the young population, I think it was even 70% isn't against some kind of civil union.  If only we could vote, we would make a difference.   All I want in life's a little bit of love To take the pain away Getting strong today A giant step each day All I want in life's a little bit of love To take the pain away Getting strong today A giamt step each day I've been told Only fools rush in Only fools rush in But I don't believe I don't believe I could still fall in love with you   I will love you till I die And I will love you all the time So please put your sweet hand in mine And float in space and drift in time All the time until I die We'll float in space, just you and I And I will love you till I die And I will love you all the time So please put your sweet hand in mine And float in space and drift in time All the time until I die We'll float in space, just you and I   Baby I love you today I guess that's what you want And I don't know where we are all going Life don't get stranger than this It is what it is And I don't know where we are all going   I will love you till I die And I will love you all the time Everything happens today And we're out here in space And I don't know where we are all going Baby I love you today I guess that's what you want  And I don't know where we are all going   Spiritualized "Ladies and Gentlemen We're Floating in Space"  During the show, they said that all anyone needs to do to get more support, is to just talk to one friend.  And it made me realize that I am actually helping, whether I realize it or not, whether I impact   everyone   or not.  I   can   make a difference.
