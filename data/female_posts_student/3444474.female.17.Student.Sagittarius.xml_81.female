In other news, my mother isn't speaking to me, which makes for a rather uncomfortable work/living environment. I think she's going through her hormonal stuff, which is just dandy, seeing as I'm leaving soon too. It comes at SUCH an opportune time, doesn't it? *sigh* I don't want to go into specifics, but essentially, she's mad at me for being selfish.   I dunno.   I'mleavingsoonI'mleavingsoonI'mleavingsoon...  Back to work, I've got mailing and such to do.
