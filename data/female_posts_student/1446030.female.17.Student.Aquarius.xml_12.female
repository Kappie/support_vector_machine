That time(after MT 'O' Level) when we went to her house...i forgot wat sumone said... den SHE said sumthing dat struck me..." pass out le bu zi dao hai hui bu hui zai lian luo..." i felt so sad dat i wan to jus bury my face into my hands and weep...but i cant. i can onli weep bitterly in my heart...i'm in agony...y cant she feel it? duhz.... betta stop it...dat hurts.
