I want people to talk to so my mind won't be on how ill I am right now. *waits for people to come online* Maybe I will draw some pictures on paint...make some icons for all of my various online journals...too many journals...its a wee bit hectic.  I spent a rather long time trying to find a free mp3 of Eleanor Rigby by The Beatles last night...I ended up downloading an mp3 of some guy telling me its not nice to take music without asking, and a thrash cover of Eleanor Rigby...which was alright, but not any where near as good as the original.  Yeah...so I guess I'll go do something produvtive with my time now...productive-ish...  Chera
