I have just got in and my face is covered in pen saying 'Bye chicken' (left cheek) ' :O) ' (right cheek)   I have just realized that I usually just right this diary one the weekends but hey!!  I'm listing to a song on the radio called 'Black velvet' its quitegood.  Now Mcfly's on....   Right these stupid little retards that I'm really pissed off with, (A.K.A the water people),have switched the water off for four days it only comes on between 9:00pm and 11:00pm which means I have to wait till the just to have a shower that's really retarded!! Yes finalymy mum says the waters now on so i can have a shower!  Go to go...  Bye x x
