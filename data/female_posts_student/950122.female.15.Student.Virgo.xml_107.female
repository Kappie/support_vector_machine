It hurts to see people who aren't even part of the whole thing (no matter how small it may be) get affected. It's hard watchingtwo of your closest friends fight. So I say this.  For God's sakes, GROW UP! You're both 16 for crying out loud, do you still need us to fix things up for you two? Nagpaparinig sa blog;  Yelling at each other thru YM Stats...Wellhot damn, talk about maturity.Talk to each other! It's so frustrating; it makes everything sohard! What you do affects all of us..  ...or did you forget that in the spur of the moment?
