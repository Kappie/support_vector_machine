I have less than 2 hours before yoga and then the rest of the evening is mine to do with whatever I will.    How odd.    So I thought it would be fun to compare the length of my outlines this semester to last.  It's pathetic and gross, I realize, but looking at my Property outline from Fall semester made me laugh out loud, so naturally, I had to find out how comical all the others were, too.    Property:  Fall = 7 pages.  Spring = 28 pages.  Contracts:  Fall = 12.  Spring = 34.  Civil Procedure:  Fall = 11.  Spring = 30.  Torts:  Fall = 11.  Spring = 26.     Criminal Law:  Fall = we didn't have this class last semester, but I couldn't leave it out of the fun.  Spring = 24.    I'm taking the new numbers as a good sign.  And now I'm going home to enjoy the rest of my evening entirely void of any duties or responsibilities.
