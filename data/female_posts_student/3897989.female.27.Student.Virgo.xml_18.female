As we were leaving for the evening from deep tissue class we had to be aware of the little family of skunks running around. They were really on the prowl. I'm surprised they didn't get in a scuffle with the little kitties running around everywhere.  The President and Dean of the school came to the 6-8 pm class tonight to tell them the schedule plans. They put all the students from both classes in the same room. One class was very lucky they were not out early like usual. I wonder if they were doing work or spending class eating dinner?  Deep tissue went well tonight. We reinforced strokes AGAIN....We're finally having our midterm Thursday. I learned a better way to get deeper. I have been doing it all wrong!! I'm thankful for the breakthrough. I can grow in more areas, I feel, now.  I went to the park between classes and had a nice walk around the lake even though my hamstring group has a great deal of lactic acid build up from this weekend. I've been drinking plenty of water and put biofreeze on them. I'm going to try to get plenty of quick restful sleep tonight.  Speaking of restful sleep..why did my dream bring me a 2 story round home with an overhang deck? Inside, on the top floor there were tables around one side of the room and I was doing a massage there. It was my home. I went downstairs and all my furniture was there, the fridge was stocked with colorful fresh fruit and veggies and my juice. He was with me, walking hand in hand, as we were searching for a place to put in the water wall....At the clinic, the secretary mentions the director has a round home in the works. It doesn't dawn on me until I remembered my dream of which is significant just to have since I only have them after a certain meditation. I disregard what she has said and when she leaves, I start searching for the round home in my dreams on the internet while I have time. I find the one, woody landscape and all, and he comments this is the house he is building; the sight I am looking at with the house from my dream. It's inspiring and confusing all at the same time. Is this dream supposed to mean something? A coincidence? He and I must have some kind of karmic connection. I can't understand why else our destinies would coincide with such similar goals and dreams?  I truly felt his presence within me as his embrace rendered such peace calming my heart. He sent me such great thankfulness, love, and peace. So strong and lasting. His skin felt like silken warmth between my arms. A willful moment in time that will rank ever high amongst my thoughts. But also, as I gave him loving touch today I felt at times my heart pumping with such force it would almost take my breath away. I assessed to see if there were some sort of physical exertion on my part, but it was naught. It only happened at the level of his 7th chakra and his 4th. We have great energy that keeps trying to bond beyond our physical being. One immaculate evening may our bodies be blessed with a shared release of our higher selves to bring understanding and enlightenment to what our energy is trying to achieve. What that energy purpose is, only time will communicate. Be the whale with the rainbow penis :D  I need to run catch some quick sleep. Thank you for the peace surrounding me, thank you for waking up my legs, revive my heart with gentle understanding, and let me touch someone's life forever.  With love,  BLG
