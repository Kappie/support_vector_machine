Um yeah okay, my dad calls asking me what his valentine looked like and i described it to him and he told me my oldest sister, amanda, ate it, which I am so not surprised for...then my dad decides to hang up on me with his last words of "Thanks a lot for nothing" i started bawling right that second considering i dont know what i did or said that was so horrible. This is was pisses me off half the time. Did i Eat them?! NO i was only doing what my dad asked me too was telling him what we got him for valentines, which my sister said he got it but he said he didnt get it, and im so confused and sad, and i dont know!!!   just got off the phone with my sister, apprently she still does have the valentine, but then why was the thing my dad found the exact thing with the exact stuff in it? what the f*ck!
