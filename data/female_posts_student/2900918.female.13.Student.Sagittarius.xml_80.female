I wanted to talk about the newborn baby that my auntie had but i decided not to [Due to the fucking com].  I went to a person's blog today and the whole post was typed in that all the punctuation marks like "," or "..." or ":" was replaced with fullstops. How irritating is that? I mean, ure trying to act cool and emo in this way, which u aren't.. sad to say.  can u imagine if someone writes a story like this [an i.e.]:  today.i had lunch.it was fabulous.i saw my fren.tim.down the street.talking to his fren.Her name was tina.reminded me of bla.and i went back home.my lovely nest.where i could enjoy the tv.it had tom and jerry.an animated cartoon.on.i went to the loo.took a pee.went back in.the loo smelt clean.dry.and hygienic.bla bla.bla bla bla. bla.  How lame can this get? First it was the neoprints in display pics, now comes this writing style.. Can bloggin get more idiotic than this? Why can't people type normally? This way, its easier to the eye too. I'm surrounded with dumbasses who can't even type properly.. What's so bad about the original method? These ppl obviously cannot differentiate between what is the better method for reading and trend of bloggin.  We already have enough fashion victims, we dont want any blogger victims who follow the trend blindly.  Use your brain ppl, and pls.do.not.type.lik.this.for.heavens.sake.  Grrrrr.  |and would you tell all your friends|cute without the e|TBS
