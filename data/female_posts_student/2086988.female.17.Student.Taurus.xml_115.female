I sware I can never be perfect for this woman, god nothing is ever good enough for her...I do so much and I try so hard, but it's never any good. Now, after ALL that shit I went through last summer, she wants to start it all over again...I'm sorry I don't look perfect, I'm sorry for not looking like a fucking size 2 barbie doll. I'm just so sick of all of this, I want to go away...
