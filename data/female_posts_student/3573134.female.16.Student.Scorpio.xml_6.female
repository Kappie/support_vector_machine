But after i came back from m'sia i got pretty busy... so anywae, why is it every movie i watch including those based on a true story always different than my life? See in movies, bad guys will reign at the beginning of the movie whereas good guys reign at the end... But why is it there isn't a single preiod of time that i reign and be happy?? well who cares... (me probably) anywaes... with the mother tounge 'o' levels being over... i have come to the realisation of how close the 'o' levels are... N i am scared shitless... yet, i seem to be able to find the time to write this stupid thing that no one seems to be reading... well it's ok... one of the reasons i write this thing is not for others to read it but for me to read it... so that i know how my life is progressin tho i dun think that progressing is the right word for it... I hope my future will improve and who knows maybe i'll lead a movie life one day... Like i said in the previous post, i am a whiner... but i dun care... it seems that the only thing worth writing in these posts are complains and feelings of sorrow... Guess tt's the only thing in life tt i'll remember.   You noe wad, maybe it's time i change my attitude on life... it's abt time i take a stand... gona make my presence felt and my work appreciated... ain't gonna be hesitant abt asking or approaching someone new... at least tt's wad my horoscope tells me to do... i dun believe em but wad the hey... it makes sense.... so till next time sayonara and au revoiure... dunno if i spelled that properly... and i'll update on wether my life has really changed or if this was juz another one of those i'm gonna change my life speeches without actually doin it...
