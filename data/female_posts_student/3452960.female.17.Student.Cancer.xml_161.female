Last night me and and my friends had a BBQ on chapel field with some drink...well maybe alot of drink. I pleasantly enjoyed it. Well...until I fell into a bush of stinging nettles with my friend Pete. Yeah, we're in pain...it's not funny! What else? Ohh..I'm still doing the ol' GCSE's. You know what? In the past 5 years I think I've meant to be learning about all the religions out there. I still know nothing about any of them. So anyway, basically, I failed my RE GCSE *laughs inside* yeah...maybe I'll regret that. But I have history coming up which is quite worrying because I want to do well in that...A* people!! And someone said something about penis enlargements?? I think I'm going to need that...(don't ask) Anyhoo there is your blab, I'll have a whole bunch of additional blab for next time Warly xx
