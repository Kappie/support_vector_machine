During the first lesson, one of my school teacher send a bouquet of “flower” to her upon somebody’s request. The flowers are not red roses or plastic flower, but they are 11 different flavours lollypops. Wow! It’s really romantic. Some of my classmates were having a celebration with her in canteen during the recess time. They bought a cake for her. This year, I was not involved in the celebration since I was not informed. Man Loo, Happy birthday.   P/s : Hey, friends. Next year I want to have a birthday celebration too!! Remember.. Hehe =)
