So many things discribe me, happy, sad, cold , warm, crazy, calm, and so many other things sorry to those who have to put up with it i show my feelings way to much. things just get to me way to much i need some medicine maybe i should go to the doctor and get fixed that might help me and my many feelings but then i would be on to much medicine and that would be bad so i dont know what i should do. do you know what i should do?? if you do leave your comments thanks to eveyone who does if anyone does ( i have only had one comment so far, man i am such a loser) well i might ttyl i dont know right now if i can make it! ~ashley~
