Now, I don't mean to point fingers, but it's been nice up until SOMEONE came back home from Boston yesterday, and now it's supposed to be summerlike again here.  Hmmm....is it just a coincidence?  Not sure, but I have my suspicions on the matter though.  But it's all good because my a/c in my car got fixed just in time for summer temperatures to return (ha!  Jim thought he had outdone me).  Like him (and thousands of others), I am waiting for that winning lottery ticket to cross my path.  Alas, though, it is an elusive little creature.    Speaking of elusive creatures, has anyone heard or seen the Mexican since he got back from Boston?  Probably hibernating somewhere.     I leave for Macomb in 2 weeks or so, THANK GOD!!  I am ready to leave the cultural armpit of the world that is named Decatur.  Although Macomb is not that much better, I at least get my own house (well, half of it anyway).  I love my family to death, but damn are they nosey.  Sometimes I feel like I'm 16 again with the 21 questions of where I'm going, who I'm going with, what time am I going to be back, etc.  Surprised they haven't tagged me with some kind of homing device.  Or maybe they have, I do tend to sleep alot, so it wouldn't be hard.  I'm ready for a vacation from my (summer) vacation.  Only a few more months and then hopefully I'll be sailing to Mexico!  I've got something to look forward to, other than graduation in December.
