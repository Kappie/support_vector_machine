And today, after picking berries, he's all like, Go away. BEFORE he was like, Oh I wanna see you I miiiiiss you..And now, he's saying it wont work out, blah blah...Then asks me if I'm ok with that! Well, shit! Even if I wasn't, what could I do? We still wouldn't be going out, it would just be me, lovesick.   I hate men. I dont know if I ever want to be with someone again. Because this just hurts.
