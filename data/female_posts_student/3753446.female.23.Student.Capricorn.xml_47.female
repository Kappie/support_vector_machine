People are singing along to their favorite oldies songs and completely butchering the lyrics. My favorite guy is singing in the shower to "Sugar Fried Honey Butts" (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch).  Do try this at home: Sing that song, with the new lyrics, at the top of your lungs like I did.  And just TRY not to laugh.
