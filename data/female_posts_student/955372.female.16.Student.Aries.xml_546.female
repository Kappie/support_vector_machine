I woke up at 10:30 (sad, i know) read for a while, played all the tunes on my sister's keyboard (mostly Crocodile Rock and Killing Me Softly With His Song) then watched disney channel, then popped in Emma (which i rented from the library) then watched meaningless hours of television. After my brain was sufficiently fried i turned the tv off, only to hear my sister "playing" the keyboard. So now here I am. A sad state. Oh also fit in there an attempt to discover my hidden talents as a pianist. I guess those talents are a twinge more hidden than I thought.
