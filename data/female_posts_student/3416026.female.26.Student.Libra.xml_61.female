Here they are:  ENRON'S KEN LAY INDICTED, TO SURRENDER EX-GOP SENATOR: BUSH SHOULD DROP CHENEY FRENCH FLOCK TO SEE "FARENHEIT 9-11"  [As for that 2nd one, I am not in favor of anything that might boost Bush's chances, but it would be fun to see Cheney dropped like a motherfucking hot potato.  It would suck if Bush then picked the  urlLink too-cool-for-school John McCain  though. Yikes.  Everyone wants a piece of his ass.]
