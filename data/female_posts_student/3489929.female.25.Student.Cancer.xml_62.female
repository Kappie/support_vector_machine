Lisa let me drive her car today, and everyone at work called me a pimp (Barbie told me to tell you your car is very much a "check-me-out-hoes" kind of car... I'm sure she meant that in the best possible way). My dad will look at it tomorrow, and then I may be paying another towing bill. Sigh.      And I can't register for my classes. My freaking PIN doesn't work.      I had to sit on the phone- at work, on my lunch break- for almost thirty minutes to get the damn number, and I get home today and it doesn't work. And because I kept trying it, the system has locked me out, so now I have to call tech support on Monday AND the registrar's office yet again to make sure the number is right. Grrrr.      My parents and I are driving to MS tomorrow so I can start looking for a part-time job and to see if there are any cheap but decent apartments. I hope they don't want to start early, but knowing my parents, they'll be knocking on the door at 8AM...      I said bye to Foxy today. It was her last day before taking off for maternity leave. She's due on the 16th. My day in the pool is the 17th. I told her to try to hold it in until then if necessary. :)      I am going to miss her, but we'll keep in touch, and I'll come visit baby Elijah.      I'm going to miss several people very much. But life goes on, and there's always the telephone. And there are several people I won't miss much at all (you hear me calling you, Crackhead?- she didn't bother to show up ALL WEEK). I can't wait to leave.      And I ordered a deluxe luxury foot spa from the incentives catalog at work. Hopefully it will be here before I go.      I'm just glad this week is over. Finally.
