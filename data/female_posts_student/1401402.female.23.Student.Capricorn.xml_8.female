When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or do things my own way, they call me a *bleep*. Being a *bleep* means I won`t compromise what`s in my heart. It means I live my life MY way. It means I won`t allow anyone to step on me. When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it, I am defined as a *bleep*. The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being everyone`s maid, or when I act a little selfish. It means I have the courage and strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won`t become anyone else`s idea of what they think I "should" be. I am outspoken, opinionated and determined. I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that! So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold within me....cuz it ain`t gonna work and I`m still gonna be a B*TCH!
