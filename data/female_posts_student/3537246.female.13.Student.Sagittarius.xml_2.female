But then in the afternoon we continued with the test because we didn't get finished in the morning and we had a supply teacher so everyone was like "what's the answer for this?!" it was hilarious... but of course i didn't do that.. -shifty eyes-  so total sweetness here cuz there's 11 days left of school work! YAY! and grad's on the 23rd (i think i said that .. before ..) and so yeah... :D I'm all hpyer and stuff all the time cuz I'm so excited. yep so that's all. later dudes
