It's funny, cause if I had had a choice, it's not the ending I would have chosen in the beginning.  But looking back on it all, this ending satisfies everyone. It's a good thing, which proves that I can't tell what will be for the best and for the worst when I'm so wrapped up in things.  I've stepped back and looked at the whole picture, and I like what it looks like.  It's a good ending, and still just a beginning ;-)
