Last week I wanted absolutely nothing to do with this office, or this place. I just wanted my bed. Now I feel better :), atleast I can work properly and get my shit done, although now I'm feeling kind of behind, but I'm sure I can catch up by the end of wednesday with everything I slacked off on.  My new cellphone is still pretty, and still awesome :)  I'm still engaged to Cameron, still don't know if he was serious, but I'm still finding it amusing to think about. ;)  and I'm still feeling peachy keen. It's not a bad morning.   Carissa bought my mom a shirt that says, "You're Not The Boss of Me" She's wearing it right now. I have a feeling she'll be wearing it all day, lol.  I brought salad for lunch, we'll see if I actually eat it today.   In conclusion, my morning is decent. :D  More in the PM.
