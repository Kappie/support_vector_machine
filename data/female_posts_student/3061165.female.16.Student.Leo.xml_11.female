Lotta games, food etc. around and i manage 2 win a few prizes! ^^ Anyway, our class(409) and another(50??) won de class competition(c which class hav de highest %age of ppl wearin ethnic costumes)... Both got 100%! Not bad, but still duno wat de prize is.. That day was pretty sickenin though... Mayb its de Maths DT im havin or de extreme warm costume ive got... ^^"  Yesterdae was suppose 2 be X-Country but after we got there early in de morning, there was a heavy downpour n they had no choice but to cancel it. Manx, waste my time... I got up at 5.45am on a Saturday jus for this! Wished i'd hav overslept... After which Sai Lam n i went home.. Ivan n de rest(besides ron who i didnt even c him there) went 2 his house... Went 2 play basketball later at the CC wif ivan, zhan yuan, yi peng, yi ren n guo wei. We played 3 matches but i won one only. >   -I'll stop here cuz i dun wanna talk bout wat happened.-   P.S: I took some photos on Racial Harmony Day... Lazy 2 put any photos here so..
