I was very suprised that I didn't get really ticked off at either of my parents... however, I've really learned to bite my tongue when it comes to a lot that they comment on.  It was wonderful seeing Rob and Kathy... although, all 3 of us got sunburned on Saturday... :-(  Which made it nearly impossible for me to go and swim or anything during the day.  I'm just glad I didn't have my heart set on swimming in the Gulf... call me crazy, but I don't like having sand in areas which sand should never be.  I did a fair amount of walking on the beach, though... and I got some WONDERFUL  urlLink sunrise pictures !  We ate at many good places, and went to the aquarium, and just spent a lot of time with each other.  It was, by far, the best vacation I've had with family since I was about 10.  The only thing was that I missed my cat, Boco, TERRIBLY.  So, I was anxious just to go and get Boco and my dog Dioji.  As we pulled up we saw a peculiar  urlLink PINKness  to the front yard...  Ya see, the youth at my church are doing a fundraiser, and it involves putting this horrid, pink, yard junk in peoples' front yards.  My Mom bought some insurance (it's like, $5 to ensure you don't have them land in your yard)... however, I apparently should've gotten some too on my own.  I think it's just a loophole that they found... and I'm convinced that the "anonymous" persons are Daughn and Deena.  Those RATS!  Just wait!!!  Maybe I'll steal a tire from one of their cars!!!  ;)
