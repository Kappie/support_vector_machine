Okay, I've been doing pretty good- working, going to school... everythings just peachy... and then the guys come in. Why oh why is it everytime I decide to just say "forget romance right now, I can do better by myself," a slew of just awesome guys comes along? I mean, yeah, I have a lotta guy friends, and they're wonderful, but it's like they are standing out more than the others right about now. I totally believe that it is possible for men and women to be strictly platonic friends, but most people dont... so that leads me to wonder if I should believe it or not. But, I have plenty of guy friends that I'm strictly platonic with. But what if things start to change? I've been havin little birdies in my ear lately tellin me some of my guy friends are cute- more than once they've said so. One of them I know there's no chance in hell that we'd ever even look at each other that way- but what if we did? Would I sleep with him or try a relationship? I dont think so. I would never want to ruin a perfectly good friendship. So now what? I dont know if I want to settle down yet. I do, but with guys acting like they are smoking rocks nowadays, I dont want to risk finding a total nutcase and trying to be his woman, 'cause once I love you, I love you- period. NO if ands or buts about it. I love unconditionally- and i know this may be starting a whole new onslaught of guys trying to win me over, but I am smart enough to know better. You may think you're smarter than me, but I've heard every line there is. It's hard to find someone that will treat me the way I want to treat someone else. I spoil myself because nobody spoils me... I know what I'm worth and I get told so everyday, if you dont agree with me. I'm a good girl, not into cheating, not into sharing my man with someone else, and I try to keep the utmost trust in my man, but with the way things have gone so far, it's hard to do that. I will trust him until he gives me a reason not to. So why am I frustrated? Why dont I want to settle down? You know how it feels when your heart gets broken... You feel like there's a lead weight on your heart making it hurt and making it hard to breathe. I'm tired of crying over a relationship that is going nowhere and I'm tired of being treated like a slave, piece of meat, "the other woman" whatever... For those who are rolling their eyes right now saying "whatever" you put yourself in my shoes. To love someone completely and without any prejudice is a strong kind of love to have- and I dont know how to love any other way. You hurt me, I love you. You cheat, I still love you. You hate me, I still love you and will cry 'cause you said you hated me, but I still love you. And then, comes the final, "it's not going to work out" and here I am, heartbroken all over again feeling like I'm having a heart attack. Or, the guy turns out to be totally crazy thinking he can order me around and when he says jump, I'm gonna say how high? No matter how much I love them, I cannot let someone control me like that 'cause you think they'd let me control them like that? I doubt it. I've spent my whole life learning the right kind of woman to be, caring, honest, and totally devoted- learned not to nag or cause scenes. I tell ya what tho, I really wanted to once. A guy I was seeing (not dating- there is a difference... if you sleep with someone you're "seeing" them) took me out to dinner once. My grandma had just died and I had just burried her on Wednesday. This is Friday, and he's just going on and on about "what if I just keeled over right now?" WTF?? Dood, my grandma just died and you want to talk to me about dying? Total head fuck is what it was. Pissed me off to the point where I lost my appetite and to fuel the fire he says, "what's the matter, you dont look happy over there" with a big grin on his face. I wanted to stab him in the face with my fork and scream, SHUT UP YA ASS! but I just kept my thoughts to myself and held my tears back. When I finally did bitch about it, it was in a letter because I dont like arguing and he informed me that he had nothing to apologize for. And I'm supposed to want to settle down with a guy- one that could possibly as insensitive as that? I dont think so. I wouldnt call myself picky- just smart. You know you're doing your job if your parents and older brothers never worry about who you're dating. Above all, liars take the cake. Dont tell me you're in school and just fail to have even a single schoolbook in your house- that's a blatant lie. Dont claim to be something you're not. Fellas, I'm telling you this so you know, the lies you use on other girls, dont work on all girls. You better try telling the truth a whole lot if you want to obtain a girl that's worth your time. She should be your best friend, someone you'd trust with your life. I know a lot of you either have a. had a crazy bitch fuck you up and scar you emotionally, or b. never been in love and are scared to death of it. Dont limit yourself to being a manwhore for the rest of your life. Strive for something more, or you're no better then those crazy slutty girls you been messin with. And you're definitely no better than the one who hurt you. I gotta close for today :D.
