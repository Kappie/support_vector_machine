I have to work tomorrow with the "hot chick" everyone talks about. I hate shallowness. I hate how Marie is starting to hang out with people who have no running definition of the word "class," and suddenly she seems to think it's rubbing off onto her. And have to listen to her tell me that making out, hypothetically, on the first date, or making out in the back of a loaded pickup is "not a big deal." Had I have asked her that two months ago she would have been vividly opposed. But then again, nothing is ever shielded from the turn of time. And yes, I hate that too.  The only person I can ever depend upon is myself. Here's to my usual inner grouch. Cheers.
