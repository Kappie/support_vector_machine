So, after being really upset about finding something to wear... although, I know that's not what I was truly upset about, I finally settle on something, we begin the somber ride to Hermitage.   We arrive at the funeral home.  There aren't too many people when we get there.  Most of our friends are already there and they all wave and give us hugs.  I just want to break down, but I know I must be strong for those who hurt more than I do.  Sad music is playing over the speakers, and you can hear Jared's mom sobbing on someone's shoulder.  There is a line through the pews that ends in a semi circle where there's Jared's urn, a slide show, and photo boards of him.  Everyone offers his mom their condolances, and finds a place to sit after looking at the pictures. Kelly shows up with Catherine, and she is already a mess.  My sister walks around with her, and gives her the support she needs, while I talk to Alex who is obviously hurting.  He isolates himself from everyone else, even when he could cry on someone's shoulder and nobody would think he was less of a man for it.  There are so many people there.  Boy Scouts, Friends, Teachers, Family, people he probably didn't know he had an impact on.  There were too many people to fit in the room.  Some had to stay outside, and jsut listen to the service.  I am glad we got there early.   The Reverand gets up, and talks about what a great person Jared was, and how he still lives with us...  Frank gives a eulogy.  It was so sad, because we all remember our last moments with him and never would have thought that it would be the last time.  Frank's eulogy is wonderful, and then they play a song by Yellowcard.  That's Jared's favorite band.  It was about saying goodbye.  Everyone is crying.   The funeral is over, and everyone groups outside, where I hug Spencer and just fall apart and cry on his shoulder. Drew is there from Florida.  Even though he had classes, he skipped them to be with us.  Quintin is crying in Emi and Kelly's arms.  I have never seen him cry until now.  Frank's face is all red and his eyes are bloodshot.  Jared was his bestfriend.  Sheena looks like she's about to lose it, and I walk over and give her a hug.  Everyone cries in someone's arms. We all came together today, in such a horrible time. Today I realize that life is too short to hold so many grudges.  I don't want to die with my life like this.  I am sorry Ben.  I am going to get my life in order so if I die tomorrow, I can leave an impact like Jared did.   God Rest his Soul.
