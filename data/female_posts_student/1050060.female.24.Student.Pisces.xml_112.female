I have the day off tomorrow but i am maybe going to be called in always. They are going to need someone in the kicthen for sure tomorrow night.   My dad is suppose to get the truck fix so I will be able to drive myself to work. My dad needs the other car. Even if I took him to work everyday and took the car it wouldn't work out because he finishes work before I do. So we need another car here for the summer anyways. Dad said that if its not too expensive he will keep the truck on the road even when I am gone to university. It would be nice bacause I still would be able to drive when i am here on the winter and spring break. Anyways I am going to go because i have the feeling that they are going to call me for work. Have a good night!
