Chris,  I was not made to sit still and do nothing. If others can idly watch while the shit hits the fan, goody, but I can't, I won't. I don't agree with that defeatist behavior and I won't ever think it's an acceptable course of "action". I respect those who choose to sit back and "see" how it turns out. I think individuals are entitled to execute their God-given free will. But just because I respect that someone's a moron and let them be in peace doesn't mean I think they're right. It just means that I want the same respect from them, I want them to leave me be in peace. In my experience getting off your arse is half the battle, unfortunately the mentality of sitting still and waiting for divine interference prevails.
