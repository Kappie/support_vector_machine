I always did love journals.  Never had a public one.  Well, there ya go.  I'm sitting here in my Pace dorm room at 1:35am.  This is the latest I've been up all summer semester-- no, forget that.  But it IS rare because I had an eight o'clock class this semester, and I tried to go to bed early.  Otherwise, I would be dragging myself out of bed at 7:50am (like this morning, for instance), pulling my hair into a ponytail, and showing up to class with no make-up on in jeans and a t-shirt.  I always try to wear my "Instant Human: Just add coffee" t-shirt when that happens.  Dang.  I feel like crap.  Maybe that's a sign I should sleep.  Nahhh...  My new hamster is running with incredible resolve in her little wheel.  I'm taking suggestions for names.  So far, I have Achilles for a boy and Olivia or Poughkeepsie for a girl.  Ha.  She's so cute.  She's some kind of dwarf hamster, and I almost fit her into a tablespoon this afternoon.  I did take a picture of her in my teacup. :)  I drank my first beer in a few weeks tonight, and it was good.  Beer is good.  Everybody should develop a taste for this most fine of drinks.  Ben, here's to you and your pint!  *raises glass*  And, Allison, to you and your foreign beers!!!  And a toast to all of you who just finished summer semester!!  Just for the record, I kicked some major behind on those two World Lit finals.  To steal a line from the best of all cartoon flicks, BOOM BABY!!!!  Well, anyhow, I went to the pet store this afternoon, and there was the most beautiful of all persian kitties there.  She had the silkiest long white hair I'd ever seen.  Ahhh.  YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HER!!!!  Ok, well, I'm losing power in my gray matter, and I have the shakes.  I'm goin to watch t.v. with my suitemate.  Bye, ya'll.
