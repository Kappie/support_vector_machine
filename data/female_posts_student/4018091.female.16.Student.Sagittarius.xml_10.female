"Pullin an Ashlee Simpson huh? haha" Yeah, it was funny when Brittany said it but not when ten million other people do it to. So, yeah. I'm getting my hair dyed and Patsy ((the hairdresser)) told me that my hair color most likely wouldn't change unless I bleached it. My hair is already almost dead because of my straightener and bleaching it may cause it to fall out. What the hell? I used to be in love with my hair and now it's gonna fall out!? So, she didn't bleach it but the color she put it doesn't change it at all. So next weekend, we're having a bleaching party, but I'm not supposed to like blow dry it or straighten it because it needs as much strength as it can get. Yeah, whatever. I hate my curly hair and I'm not about to not use my straightener. I have an unhealthy relationship with that thing! Haha, yeah. So me and Logan were supposed to have an OFFICIAL pimp/hoe date today before I went to Floores but his bronco broke down and so now I'm gonna go shopping with my mom. YAY?? Haha. Okay, well I'm gonna go straighten my hair! Byee!!
