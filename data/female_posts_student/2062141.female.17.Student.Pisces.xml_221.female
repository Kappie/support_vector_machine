I went sunbathing today for two hours, I didn't get burnt and my skin still feels warm. I'm proud of myself. I shall be TAN for summer. It is my goal. Oh boy this weekend's gonna rock. Friday shall be like the greatest day ever, and Saturday me and Ryan are seeing Donnie Darko, and on Sunday I'm seeing the Billy Joel musical with Caitlin. YaY! And today and the next two days, final days, we get to go to school 2 hours later. Sleeeeeep. Yes sleeeeeeep.
