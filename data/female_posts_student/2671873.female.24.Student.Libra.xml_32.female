Nevermind the cold I am getting and the working insane hours at the bar as well, but whatever that is all fluff.  :)  So my life this week has been endless and alas I have to leave again to make it up to our teen program tonight.  I am still looking forward to going home, but the more I am here the more this town has grown on me.  Oh yeah the 12th went well, well all except some silly fight in Belfast, but I guess that is what happens when you combine drink and pig headed folks who can't compromise.  WAHOO for stubborn drunk jackasses!  Or not.  Well that's me signing off.    Peace!
