Anyone else feel like that sometimes?   But anyways, the more I thought about that, the more I realized - hmm, the reason I don't have a crush on anyone, is because there  isn't  anyone. Or at least anyone I'd consider having a crush on. See my problem? It is the inescapable circle of doom!! *dum dum dummm*   So  then  I thought, I need to meet more anyones. Which means, I need to go out more and meet more people, because the CDS pool of anyones is sorely lacking. Which means, I need some sort of hobby, since piano guys aren't really my type (or at least until they hit puberty). Which means, I need ideas! And no sports, since I loathe sports.   Or, better idea: instead of  me  meeting people on my own, someone can just  introduce  me to anyones! Any takers? hehe. Just kidding, just kidding.   But I mean honestly. This is weird. I dislike this feeling intensely. I want to  eradicate  it. Isn't that an awesome word? I decided I liked that word today, and that I wanted to use it. So there you go: eradicate. Muahaha. It gives me Dr. Evil-type shivers, you know?   So after all that blathering, I really haven't made a point. And since I don't have one, I've decided I'll be silent, and leave you all in peace. heh. Au revoir!
