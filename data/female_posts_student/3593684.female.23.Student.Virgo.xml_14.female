Well, it must have been wednesday (I use the past tense, it being 12:30 am), because it was, in all ways, a shitty day.  Let's start at the begining   Act I, Scene I:   Time:  12:30 AM  Place:   urlLink Club Spaceland , Los Angeles, CA.  State of Mind:  Mostly Sober  I had just finished sitting through two and a half shitty bands. Not true: one really shitty band, one band that was entirely unnovel, but okay to listen to, and one band,  urlLink the standard , which I thought would fucking ROCK, but which were really just OKAY live.   Plugging those values into the rockability calculus, the evening's rating was: -2.5.    To top it off,  everybody  at the concert was dressed like an emo catalog model.  (see instructions on  urlLink how-to dress emo ), except for one dude: MR. I-Look-like-jesus-and-smell-like-him-too-because-i-haven't-bathed-shaved-or-changed-my-shirt-in-a-month DUDE.  And, of course, he was the ONLY guy who hit on me.    Well, i guess it wasn't like I was going to the show to get picked-up.  Oh, who am I kidding? Of course that is part of the reason I went.  That and the need to earn coolness points with Vince/David/Rod and other misc. men in my life.  But more on that later...   Act I, Scene 2   Time:  1:35  Location:  Some where, I don't know where, in the middle of Los Angeles.  State of Mind:  95% sober, 100% paranoid, and really needing to pee.  I got totally fucking lost trying to find my way home. I made it there eventually. But I kept looking for the damn cops.  Not that I was in danger of getting a DUI.  Well, I don't know, maybe I was.  What's the limit these days? .08, that's about one drink. I had two starting at 9pm, but no dinner.  So maybe I was at risk...  Yeah, yeah we all know that drunk driving is not something one should do, or joke about.  Well, maybe it's okay to joke about: So a priest is driving drunk down the road...   Act II, Scene 1   Time:  seven-o'clock-in-the-fucking-A.M.  Location:  in my small and sadly empty bed  State of Mind:  Hung over.  Nuff said.   Act III, Scene 1   Time:  11:30  AM  Location:  The Firm  State of Mind:  Hungry, tired, frustrated and feeling generally stupid  Not only do I constantly feel stupid at my job (I am a grossly over-paid summer associate, read: law student, at an LA firm, to remain unamed for now), but I have only two people to smoke with.    Also, I fucking hate my HR director.  She is a total fake-nice cunt and I can't stand her. And despite all my rants about not liking play-nice-social-interactions and false pretences, the uncertainity of whether or not she overheard me telling another co-worker that I didn't like her is driving me batty.   And where were my two smokers, but nowhere...   Act III, Scene 2   Time:  sometime later  Location:  Smoking a cig. outside The Firm.  Enter MR. Vince.  Smoker #1.  Vince is great. He's smart, cute, nice, interesting and has good taste in music. At least as far as I can tell, since I have only interacted with him a couple of times.  Did I mention that he's hot?  Even, with the piece of rice, which of course I noticed, on the front of his shirt.  (Hey, Vince, if you're reading this, I have even more reason to be embarrassed than you do.)  Did I mention that he's 40? and I'm 23.  Probably not.  Aye, and there's the rub.  I am quite certain that Mr. Vince has nothing but the nicest intentions towards me and I must appear to be quite a baby to him.  And that's really too bad.  Let's do the math:    *  Former rock musician = +5  (those damn guitarists) *  Former alcoholic  = +3 (can't help but like the bad boys) *  Former alcoholic  = -3 (would feel guilty about driving him to drink) *  Offered to loan me an     "extra" electric  = +4 *  Is an "older man" = +4 (i have a lolita fantasy). *  Kept his youthful     good looks        = +5 *  Has a shitty hair-cut  = -3  *  Likes his shitty hair-cut = +4 (i like his "I don't give a damn about what other's think attitude")  I think that comes out to 19 on the fuckability scale.  Which is pretty damn high (Mr. Jesus-Dude was a negative 40).    Anyway.  MR. Vince is cool. But completely unavailable.  I am still trying to get his number without coming across as hitting on him.  Because honestly, I actually like him independently of any carnal desire and I don't want to scare him off (since he could be a very cool friend).  Anyway, this is part of the shitty day, because even though I am trying to play it cool, I am sure I come across as pathetic, lonely and overly eager.  Sigh... I used to make fun of people for wearing eau de desperation, now I am its fucking spokeswoman    Act III, Scene 3.   Time:  7:00 pm  Location:   I-10 West  State of Mind:  Bored, exhausted, sucking fumes in LA traffic.  Nothing to do after work, no one to come home to.  At least my amazon package was there when I got home.   Act IV, Scene 1   Time:  8 pm to present  Location:  in front of my laptop  State of Mind:  self-loathing amusement  As I said, I had nothing better to do.  So I started this blog.  How Paaaa_thet_IC! oh yeah and I smell bad.  and I have a dry cough because the office air is to dry and I smoke a pack of cigs yesterday.  And I am tired. and cranky. and I keep thinking about the stupid things I said: i) at the concert to the band when I purchased their CD, ii) to my office-mate about my HR director, iii) MR. Vince, iv) David.    Who is David? Or Rod, for that matter.  That will have to wait for the next post because I'm tired and I'm going to bed.  Where's my damn Ambien?   Fin
