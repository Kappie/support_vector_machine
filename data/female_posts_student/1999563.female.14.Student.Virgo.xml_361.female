But, if I don't go to school tomorrow then I can't go to tennis and I wont be able to play in the game against Battle Ground on tuesday..which would be quite depresssing. Gosh. UGH I am so i dunno.  I wish I was dead.  This has been like the stupedist day of my existence.  I am so physically and emotionaly weak but I just gotta continue with life. I can't just let me being sick hold me down.
