But that's the fun of summer, isn't it? Still trying to get used to it. I constantly have a vague and constant sneaking feeling of having not done some project, or having to wake up early. I remember a dream last night where we were already back in school, but we were sitting in my grandmother's house, and everyone was talking about what I had done and why I couldn't remember anything. It has a lot to do with the fact that every morning and every few hours I come to the false realization that it's already over. I love summer/hate school way too much.  By the way, for those of you that have Rhetoric by Aristotle for AP next year yet... WHAT A BORING BOOK ! It's horrible...even the table of contents is tedious...still working on reading it all, and yes, there's that much to every little caption for each section in this damned book. Slaughterhouse Five is pretty damned cool tho, lots of timetravel and such, and it's just a tripped out book; I'm pretty sure that it'll be a wonderful reprieve from that horrible English-abusing, big-words-overusing argument bible.  *yawn*
