Im beginning to think that i truly am fat, this black guy says "eww put some pants on" I HAD SHORTS ON, but, doesnt muscle weigh more than fat? wtf. *sigh*  Life sucks right now. I dont really know what to do. it seems like im complaining but what else am i sposed to do? :**( im tired. im gonna take a nappy wappy.
