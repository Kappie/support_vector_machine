I'm gonna post the part that made me cry, just incase you haven't read it, because you need to. It really shows what war does to people:  Later, higher in the mountains, we came across a baby VC water buffalo. What it was doing there I don't know-no farms or paddies-but we chased it down and got a rope around it and led it along to a deserted village where we set up for the night. After supper Rat Kiley went over and stroked its nose. He opened up a can of C rations, pork and beans, but the baby buffalo wasn't interested. Rat shrugged. He stepped back and shot it through the right fron knee.  The animal did not make a sound.  It went down hard, then got up again, and Rat took careful aim and shot off an ear.  He shot it in the hindquarters and in the little hump at its back.  He shot it twice in the flanks. It wasn't to kill; it was to hurt.  He put the rifle muzzle up against the mouth and shot the mouth away.  Nobody said much.  The who platoon stood there watching, feeling all kinds of things, but there wasn't a great deal of pity for the baby water buffalo.  Curt Lemon was dead.  Rat Kiley had lost his best friend in the word.  Later in the week he would write a long personal letter to the guy's sister, who would not write back, but for now it was a question of pain.  He shot off the tail.  He shot away chunks of meat below the ribs.  All around us there was the smell of smoke and filth and deep greenery, and the evening was humid and very hot.  Rat went to automatic.  He shot randomly, almost casually, quick little spurts in the belly and butt.  Then he reloaded, squatted down, and shot it in the left front knee.  Againt the animal fell hard and tried to get up, but this time it couldn't quite make it.  It wobbled and went down sideways.  Rat shot it in the nose.  He bent forward and whispered something, as if talking to a pet, then he shot it in the throat.  All the while the baby buffalo was silent, or almost silent, just a light bubbling sound where the nose had been.  It lay very still.  Nothing moved except the eyes, which were enormous, the pupils shiny black and dumb. Rat Kiley was crying.  He tried to say something, but then cradled his rifle and went off by himself. The rest of us stood in a ragged circle around the baby buffalo.  For a time no one spoke.  We had witnessed something essential, something brand-new and profound, a piece of the world so startling there was not yet a name for it. Somebody kicked the baby buffalo. It was still alive, though just barely, just in the eyes. "Amazing," Dave Jensen said. "My whole life, I never seen anything like it." "Never?" "Not hardly. Not once." Kiowa and Mitchell Sanders picked up the baby buffalo.  They hauled it across the open square, hoisted it up, and dumped it in the village well. Afterward, we sat waiting for Rat to get himself together. "Amazing," Dave Jensen kept saying. "A new wrinkle. I never seen it before." Mitchell Sanders took out his yo-yo.  "Well, that's Nam," he said. "Garden of Evil. Over here, man, every sin's real fresh and original."   well...comments would be nice...
