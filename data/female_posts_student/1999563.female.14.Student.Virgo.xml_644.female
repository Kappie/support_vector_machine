See, shoutboxes are temporary but comments last forever.... :)  Dude, I have a piece of popped cord stuck in my braces and it wont come out!! I don't understand! why do I have you go through this torcher? :) Acctually, braces are totally not as bad as I thought they would be. I thought my teeth would always hurt but they don't! Plus, I don't look like  a beaver anymore!!  I have  a  really boring life. Well not most of the time, but today it i quite boring. I have no clue what I am going to fill my time with today! Hmm....  You know what. Whenever I say goodbye on a blog post it just feels akward. Like should I just leave without telling you i am going to leave? Do I have to "sign" my name? Gosh, so many decisions!  Ummmm...
