NIKO GOT AN ASSIST ON AARON DOWNEY'S GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Osgood was not on his game tonight, i'm telling you.   And Niko got in the penalty box for high-sticking double minor!!!!  Thats my boy!!!! He's actually been getting in the box alot this season, he must be getting caught for all that hooking/high-sticking he doesn't normally get caught for, lol.  Thats my Niko!  This is a great night for partying and celebration.  Now me and Brittany are going to go play NHL 99 and win a Stanley Cup.  Rejoice, for the Stars have won against a team they had no chance against!  Go Stars! ~~~Taylor~~~
