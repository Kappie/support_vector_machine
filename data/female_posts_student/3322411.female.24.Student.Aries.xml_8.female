I found it to be an interesting and insightful case in which individuals can learn from. I thought it was extremely unfortunate that the fellow was not offered a position because her protege, John, was physically attracted to her. After all of her accomplishments and outstanding work, she was denied a position simply because she was an attractive female. I know for a fact I'd be extremely peeved if I worked my rear off and I was denied a position because my employer was physically attracted to me. He made an assumption saying he thought the attraction was mutual and if she was given the position, it could potentially lead him into having an affair. You cannot make ethical and moral judgments or decisions based only on an assumption; it could wind up backfiring, as it did in this cases. I honestly believe that this would make any individual, whether male or female, feeling extremely humiliated. After all that effort and time she put in, was he simply giving her all those praises because he was attracted to her?  In any organizational setting, individuals are going to work with members of the opposite sex that they might find attractive, but that does not mean they are going to act on their impulses especially if they are happily married with or without children. The fellow might not even have had the slightest bit of interest in her mentor. She had every right to be upset with not getting that position, but claiming sexual harrassment might have been the wrong way to handle the situation. After she was offered another position, her male colleagues and executives limited the amount of time they spent with her. When an individual claims or threatens sexual harrassment charges, especially if they were working for the first time, it makes the situations with the opposite sex more tense. They fear that if they look at her the wrong way or say something out of the ordinary, she would file sexual harrassment charges against them. Who would want a reputation as the individual who makes sexual harrassment threats? It is often rare that males make sexual harrassment claims, but if was one in my organization that made a claim or threat, I would be extremely wary of him.    With John being the CEO of his organization, he should have made a better judgment call. In his eyes, he didn't see that he did anything wrong, but he brought humiliation and distrust to himself, his wife, and even the organization. The fellow had definitely warranted a position in that organization after her accomplishments and efforts she so diligently worked so hard for. I have a strong feeling that sexual harrassment occurs more often in work settings, but it is not reported for this very reason: the individual making the accusation does not want to have that reputation and have it follow him or her around everywhere he or she goes.
