I dont know why i'm just mad. i dont deserve this mark. my boyfriend had to go to Co-op so i didnt have anyone to vent to either. oh well it'll pass. I'm reading a really interesting book, it's called The Perks of Being a Wallflower. by stephen....something i dont know, im too lazy to go to my bag and get it. lol i'm watching Fresh Prince of Bell-Air and will just burnt down his house. great show. anyways I best be off.
