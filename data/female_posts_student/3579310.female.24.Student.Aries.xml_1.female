I have been accepted to an international AIESEC conference. It is called You! Can. It's in Hanover. Germany. I am so excited and so scared that my dad will not let me go... I have to convince him somehow..... it sucks to think that I am 24 and still have to convince him and am so dependent on him. Well anyways I guess it makes life easier ;o)) I have been really busy lately.... AIESEC work hass gotten to be too much. The work of a while LC is being done by 2 people here. There are so many problems. I do not know how to do half the shit I am doing but I am faking my way to success ;o)) I hope I make it all the way there..... I was just remembering how badly i miss my family. You know how when you miss someone so much that your heart really seriously does hurt.... that is what I am feeling now. It is really hard to leave your whole family like this. The sad thing is that they are all together and do not know what it feels like to miss them so much. It is so sad to not have a vivid picture of your mom on your mind. To not have spoken to your brother in so long you cannot even count. To not have attended your sisters wedding and to have never met her husband. To not have seen her in her pregnancy. To have a father that does not see you enough to know anything about you. To be so superficial with all of them because the distance dictates that you do not get any closer. IT HURTS!!!! I also realized one of my bigger problems in living with my aunt stems from the fact that I have all the responsibilities of being her daughter and none of the benefits. You know I have to do what she wants, clean, take care of her kids, run errands, etc etc but I do not get the feeling of unconditional love, of the hug that makes everything right when you are having one of those wrong days. SO I guess I am in the grey areas of all my relationships.  Well summer is about to start... I am already starting on my tan. A lot of people are coming here this summer. All 3 of my half brothers/sister are coming for the whole summer. It will be strange. I do not think I have lived this long with any of them. My dad is staying for a week.....  Ok lets get off that depressing subject.... Yesterday I went to meet with some people to delegate work to, met with the advertising agency to discuss the ad and the take over ceremony for AIESEC. This week I will be meeting with the managers and CEOs of some of the better companies that Alexandria has to offer. This is amazing considerign that I am still in my final year of university. When I graduate I get to write on my CV that I am a Vice President and a member of the executive board of one of the largest global organizations in the world. How amazing is that!!!!!!!!!! Well I will leave on this happier note...
