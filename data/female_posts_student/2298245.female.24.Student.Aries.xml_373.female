First of all, there is a poll to  urlLink rank the best sports movies of the past 25 years , in celebration of ESPN's 25th birthday.  You can go and vote, and then tune in at a later date to see how the experts feel.  This poll is somewhat weak because it eliminates all those great, older sports movies, such as  Pride of the Yankees  or the musical  Take Me Out to the Ballgame .  They also have, on Page 2,  urlLink a comparion of fiction and reality , per the Cleveland Indians and  Major League .  There's also a  urlLink very funny article by Bill Simmons , also on Page 2, about the "evil women of sports movies" and the foibles of watching deleted scenes of your favorite movies.  Here he is on his experience getting to see deleted scenes from the upcoming release of  Hoosiers :   No Wet Blanket Girlfriend was worse than Fleener. She didn't invent the genre, but she did perfect it. I was already expecting the worst from the Hickory rally scene ... and then ... there was Myra pulling Coach Dale aside, batting her eyelashes, dusting off a smile that hadn't been used since 1938, her voice softer than ever before. She looked like -- gasp! -- a real person. Myra thanked the coach for everything, wished him luck in the game and announced she was moving to Chicago, win or lose. "I just wanted to thank you," she says. "I wouldn't have had the courage to do this without you."  Wait a second ... what? You're Myra Fleener! You may as well be Satan! You're thanking someone?  Then she drops this bomb: "You know, Chicago isn't that far away." Or something like that. I can't remember the exact wording, because there was blood spurting from my eyes while I was watching it. Basically, she was telling Coach Dale she wanted to continue their relationship in long-distance form. Like two college kids. What was this, the season finale of The OC?  "No!" I kept screaming. "Noooooooo! This can't be happening! MAKE IT STOP!!"   And that's when they escorted me out of the building. But not before I learned three important lessons. First, be careful what you wish for. Second, deleted scenes are usually deleted for a reason. And third, Wet Blanket Girlfriends are much more useful in sports movies than Dutifully Supportive Girlfriends. Find a woman who doesn't believe, a woman with a knack for twisting the knife, and you'll probably find a pretty good sports movie that comes with her.   I will admit I don't remember the movie all that well, though I remember a vague feeling of liking it.  But this piece is still very funny, nonetheless.  Anyone can relate to that deleted scenes thing - or at least any movie fan can.  My favorite sports film is probably  Field of Dreams .  This movie is wonderful, and lyrical, and I never tire of watching it.  Not only is it one of the best sports movies, it is one of the best films ever made.  And I say this as the person on the planet who is probably least enamored with Kevin Costner.  He is not what makes the movie good, though it is serviceable in it (I feel the same way about  The Untouchables ).  The movie really captures the essence of what makes baseball so special, and this is no easy feat, since it is very hard to put into words, except to say that it is part of the very fabric of the nation itself, one of the few things that are truly American.  Much like the art of movies itself, which while it developed somewhat contemporaneously around the world, was perfected in Hollywood.  It is also for this reason that baseball makes the best movies.  There is something magical about baseball and film, something that comforts us and makes us think that we are not alone.  When you see a really good movie, or a really exciting ball game, it makes you feel connected to the other people around you, from close friends to perfect strangers, and all of you leave understanding something that you didn't understand before, sharing a secret and a commonality with those who were there that those who weren't could never comprehend.  There are some good movies about other sports - Oliver Stone's surprisingly good  Any Given Sunday  is a notable example - but baseball has definitely provided the most fertile ground.  What's the best scene, you ask?  Well, aside from every frame of Field of Dreams, I think that honor would have to go to the very last scene in  Eight Men Out , about the Chicago Black Sox scandal of 1919.  If you have not seen the movie, feel free to read on or not, as I really don't think it ruins anything - unless you're one of those people who likes to go into a movie pure.  In the scene, which takes place several years after the scandal was over, a bunch of guys sit around watching a game of some sort in New Jersey.  They are speculating about one of the players on the field, wondering if it is really Shoeless Joe Jackson playing under an assumed name.  It is in fact him, played in the film by D.B. Sweeney.  They argue back and forth, and discuss the player's checkered past - he has now been banned from professional baseball.  Suddenly, one of Jackson's former teammates, the also-banned Buck Weaver, played by John Cusack, interjects into their conversation:  "I saw him play."  He describes him as the best.  They ask him if they think the guy playing now is him.  His very sad response:  "Nah.  Those fellas are all gone now."  This is one of the better film endings I have ever seen.  It always gets me - the pathos of it is brilliant and such a striking failure and corruption in baseball is certainly akin to the failure and corruption of the American Dream itself - and stays with me long afterwards.    But  Field of Dreams  is still the best.  The film is a wonder.  It is mysterious and strange, yet so familiar and warm at the same time.  And I can't watch it without turning into a blubbering fool.
