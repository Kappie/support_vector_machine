I discovered this website (    urlLink   www.fiendster.com      ) on a magazine ( CLEO ).  So basically, it is just a frienster-haters. Or shall I say..antifriendster site? I thought it has anything cool in it but none. (or Im the one who doesnt really explore the..thing) wutever it is.. Its lame. But try and check it out!           By the way, this is my first time here ( in blogger.com ). I dont really blog because I dont have the time. But blogging is interesting ya know. It is something that everyone should do. BLOG! - yeah, Its easy for me to say.. I myself is not a good blogger.     p/s: Anyone here good in HTML? or RICH with HTML code?
