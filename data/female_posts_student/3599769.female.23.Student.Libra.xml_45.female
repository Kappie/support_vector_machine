I wanted to call him so badly, but I called Jenn instead to keep me busy. Line 2 rings, I get off the line with Jenn. It's his voice. I already know but I asked who it was anyways.   You: Busy? Me: Uh,nuh. YOu: I can't hear you. Me: I said no. You: Do you still have the pic of me in full uniform? Me: Yeah. (Its still posted at my desk dumbass) You: Do you think I can have it? Me: (biting my lip) You can have whateva you want. You: I just want that pic, in case I die I'd like to have a good pic of me. (his job safety just went down about 500+ points so very much a possibly) Me: Not funny. Well if you die, I'll make sure they have that pic.  You: I just want to frame it and put it in the house. Me: No. YOu: Please. ME: No. (He already knows I'm gonna give it to him) You: Yep, first day today. I'm gonna bring home a cruiser soon. My uniform is really hot I'm sweating and I'm in inside. I'm gonna have to show you my uniform sometime.  Me: Uh, huh. Well, I'm very happy things worked out so well for you.  You: (sullen) Yeah. Oh, I need to put my contacts on, call you back.  Me: yep.    click
