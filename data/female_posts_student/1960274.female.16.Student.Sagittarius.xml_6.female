I think I was in an onry mood or something.  I snapped at people about everyday.  One person in particular,(sorry nathan), but it's all good now. Then that Sunday was a full day.  I had orchestra from 11:30- 2:00.  Then Nathan and I went over to PW's for the last 5 minutes of the leadership lunch, then I went home.  For about an hour and I was off to church once again.  VBS closing program.  After that we ended up helping put all the decorations away in the barn..what an adventure.  You'd think we could come up with at least 1 truck, sseeing as like all the guys have trucks, but all we had was Amanda's jeep and Mike's girly car. (sorry mike, the mustang is better, i don't care what year it is.)  That took a while.  Then we went to Fazoli's.   It was fun.  Jared rearranging the restaurant, the universal breadstick call, what could be better.  haha! Some people decided to go to Dan's to watch Zoolander, so we took Eve home, then Kelsy home, and somewhere along the way my shoe got thrown out the door by Jaybo.  Then we get in Jaybo's dad's old stick, where the dashboard light doesn't work so we had no idea how fast we where going.  That along with Amanda's backseat driving...good times, good times.  Haha.  Last week was Talents for Christ Nationals in Chicago.  Actually it was in St. Charles right out of Chicago.  I had so much fun.  Although I didn't place, I came away with a great experience and many great memories.  Weird judges (haha eve), TGIF, magic guys, Justin's stories, shoes, Target, Leuker (what???), Regis and Kelly, Target Furniture, Nathan's magic tricks, I could go on and on.  This week I've been at work a lot.  I don't really like my job anymore, but the people are great.  Thunder and Lightning charades with Will, pink whistles, Jim and Adam's defence class, great times. The fourth was a good day too.  I love the pig roast.  I stabbed Jaybo with a fork and made him bleed.  haha! Lots of orchestra stuff that day.  It was fun though.  I went to Slaytor Hill and listened to some of the music with Nathan, Matt, and Turza.  Learned how to brigde when I shuffle (sorta), watched the fireworks.  THe fireworks were fun..even though some other stuff happened.  Aaron- I do NOT want you to sit on me!! lol.  Now we leave for SMITE in less than 10 days!! I can't wait! There's still a ton to do, but it will all work out. The people in my SMITE group are great.  I'm actually getting along with just about all of them.  It's gonne be a great trip! Life's been pretty good lately.  Well I've rambled for long enough.  I'm out. And he won a free book off the radio.
