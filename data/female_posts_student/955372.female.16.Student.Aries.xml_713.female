I'm staying at my aunt's apt. on friday because my parents are going to some other random wedding in cape may. And my sister is going to some sleep over thing. I would stay here alone, but we have no TV or air conditioning, and my aunt does. Hmmm tough descision I know. Speaking of our TV which was apparently MIA. Our TV broke like two weeks ago or something like that. So we gave to Boscov's to fix, they sent it to reading (which took like two weeks, even though Reading is only like an hour away) Then they lost it for a while. But good news now it's found and in Reading. I want my freaking TV back.
