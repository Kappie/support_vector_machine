Sbi nya na there was a point before na naiinis sya sakin dahil nasasaktan ka na daw bcoz of me…it was as if you thought and felt daw na binabale wala ko lang ikaw…parang daw bale wala lang sakin yung pagmamahal mo sa kin dati………and this daw might have been the reason why you left me……she said that this was the only time that I reacted to you…I was too late na daw…………………………Honestly, I have absolutely no idea why you thought that way….Think of it…. Would you think id talk about you to the whole class of 2-9 halos everyday kung binabale wala kita? Would you think id skip some class lectures just to find time to write you letters kung binabale wala kita? Would you think id txt you everyday to see how you are doing kung binabale wala kita? Would you think id pray for you every single night just so that you’ll be safe and so that God may help you in your problems kung binabale wala kita? Would you think papabayaan ko na inaaway ako ng ibang tao dahil sayo kung binabale wala lang kita? Would you think id try all I can just so that I could be whom you want me exactly to be kung binabale wala lang kita? Would you think id try all my might to keep us together kahit ayaw ng ibang tao king binabale wala kita? Would you think id say that I love you kung binabale wala lang kita??????? ………………………I can’t understand how you could not have seen that…… I for myself had even thought that maybe I was going to forward or something all bcoz you txted me before that you were not the kind of person who’d say “I love you” everyday…that’s the reason why there was a time na I started to “lay low” on the things I have been doing……….ang hirap mo mahalin…………………….sna maintindihan mo yung reason kung bakit lalo akong nahihirapan mag-“move on”…I could not see kc that ive done anything wrong……so don’t expect me to let go just right away bcoz it’s hard….and I know you know how hard it is because you’ve already experienced being left behind…………………………….IM TRYING MY BEST OK…it just takes time………… I did not write this letter to make you realize anything…..and I have no intention of getting you back …..like I said….may gusto lang ako linawin..yun lang talaga…..btw, I also want to say sorry dahil nagalit daw si louie sayo bcoz of me…kasalanan ko naman talaga….di na mauulit…ako na ang lalayo………pero sana lang kung mahal na mahal ka niya matuto siyang magtiwala sayo….dahil I am absolutely sure na wala ka talagang balak na balikan ako because you love her so much…you may not notice this but, i know that bcoz when I see both of you together………you seem to flash your most happiest and prettiest smile….......im happy for you pau……all I want right now is to wish the best for you………..stay happy with louie….:)  P.S. You don’t have to reply if you don’t want to…im not expecting you too..
