You can actually begin to appreciate it more when you have nothing on your agenda. I went shopping with my friend in SM Manila, and it was great! Though I only bought one blouse, it was okay. Shopping really makes me feel good. After that the driver picked me up and I went to Festival Mall by myself. I just really like shopping alone, I don't know why. After another shopping marathon, I settled in SBC to have a nice tall glass of iced mocha.  While I waited for our driver, (he was picking my mom up at ATC)I contemplated the things i've done over the past weeks. Sigh... it's been real good.
