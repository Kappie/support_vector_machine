Thunderstorms caused a number of delays but eventually the billed artists took the stage, including Steve Winwood who had some water-related equipment problems that nearly cancelled his set.    Warren Haynes, Kingaroo   Warren Haynes, whose Live at Bonnaroo came out last week, performed multiple times over the course of the weekend. On Friday he joined Chris Robinson and New Earth Mud for “Got Love If You Want It.” Then on Saturday he appeared on the main stage on two separate occasions over three sets, the first with Gov’t Mule and the later two with the Dead.   Adrian Belew Sits in With Primus   Manchester-TN, Primus performed the only late-night outdoor set of the festival, appearing on the Which Stage around 1AM on Sunday morning. This setting proved apt for the band and its production elements, which included a series of orb screens behind the group. Late in the group’s set Primus invited King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew out for a version of that group’s “Thela Hun Ginjeet.”   William Hung: Bonnaroo Grand Marshall   Manchester, TN- The second annual Bonnaroo Mardi Gras parade took place on Friday night (technically Saturday morning) with a special, curious guest of honor. William Hung, the American Idol cast off appeared as the Grand Marshall. Hung delivered flat, off-key versions of a few songs including “Can You Feel The Love Tonight” and ”She Bangs.” No word as to whether this was intended as a commentary on the vocal quality of performers within this scene.   The Inverted Umphrey's>moe. Switch   Manchester, TN- Two months ago in Las Vegas, Umphrey’ McGee emerged during moe.’s set. On Friday night moe. returned the favor, appearing mid-way through Umphrey’s McGee’s late night performance at the Other Tent. The members of the quartet emerged one at a time during a jam that developed out of “Triple Wide” and remained on stage for “Recreational Chemistry” and “Brent Black” (the latter song also featured String cheese Incident drummer Michael Travis who was cajoled out of the audience by moe.’s Rob Derhak). Then the group brought out Umphrey’s manager Vince Iwinski for a version of “Enter Sandman” with Iwinski looking particularly Hetfieldesque. Following the song, Umphreys’s returned and kept the metal momentum going with a take on “And Justice For All.”
