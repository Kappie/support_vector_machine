Fueds between my sisters and I have hit the point where we can hardly be in the same room together. Stressing about the yard sale, "Bobby", and my upcoming vacation is making everyone in the house, including me, a little crabby.  I've done a little on the next chapter... Yeah... Just a little...  g2g  amber
