The end is the best: Everything ends with the giddily ridiculous  "Braineaters"  in which the chanting voices of the band bemoan their  constant diet of cerebella and ask for intestines instead , but the real freaked-out highlight comes smack dab in the middle with "Mommy Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight." Taken from the show made up of the Evilive release, it starts out on the edge and, after Danzig delivers the title sans instruments, turns into an  explosion of rhythm and feedback that should have killed everything within 50 feet of the amps.   So great.   Shelby called me today around noon. I was so happy for a long time after that. Shelby Shelby Shelby. Her birthday is tomorrow! I hope she feels better...she's sick. :( And her party's today...I don't know if she's mad I'm not coming or not...I don't think so...she said she wasn't or anything like that...but a lot of people are bailing out...I don't know why...that's so sad. I would go if I had any guts at all. I'm definetly going to her 18th. I will go to her 18th no matter what. No chance I'll get out of the next one. No, no chance at all. No chance whatsoever. Nope.      Music: Malleus Maleficarum - AFI
