Right now however, as I am just starting my blog, I want to comment on the freinds that I hold so very dear.  Brooklyn, Bri Bri, and Rizz are always there for me.  Yeah it sounds cheesy, "These girls are  always there for me" but they really are, and always have been.  Brooke and I came to be friends becuase of a forced seating chart in 5th period sience, Brianna and Erika came a long this year at sophmore homecoming, and are like sisters now.  Through everything I have done this year I have always had there there to give me advice and laughter, and I don't know what I would do without them.  Always making me laugh, and ready to listen.  And even though I just met them all within the last two years, but the bond we have is unbreakable.  It's already gone through a lot of hard things, deaths, fights, cops, everything, but it is always there, and always lasting...I hope all of you reading this are as lucky as I am, to have friends you can't live without.
