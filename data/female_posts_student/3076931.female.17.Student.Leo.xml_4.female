Well..I'll start with one. My first tattoo I want is a four leaf clover. so I'll have good luck always and forever. The other tattoo I want is one that says lucky 7 like they do on the slot machines in casinos. yay cuz 7 is my lucky number.  These tattoos are def gonna be hidden..no places that are going to be visible while I am fully clothed..cuz if my dad found out..he would KILL me. Not so much my mom. She wants to get one but my daddy-o won't let her. I guess she doesn't do it out of respect for him. Hmm..I still have respect for my dad..but come on, it's my body.   So today was incredibly uneventful.  I decided not to go to school today, so I pretty much sat around the house and ate. My parents left for New Orleans today. wahoo no parents. hit me up if u wanna party. haha. This is a really boring entry. So i'll stop writing.  oh yeah..shout out to my brother...he's the big 13 today! weee happy birthday, bro!
