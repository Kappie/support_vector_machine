And although I complained (wait, I didn't really complain, but I sure wanted to) it ended up being good because we were able to spend the first day on the gorgeous beach. I will have to post some pictures...it was just so damn beautiful. After sunset we went to the markets to look for souvenirs and such. Everyone is so friendly there! They all asked me if I had a boyfriend...and that they would be my "Mexican Boyfriend". Everyone kissed me on the cheek and held my hand, touched my back, etc. Honestly, and this is not an exaggeration in the least, about 17 people asked me that. One, Diego, even offered to take me dancing, he would pay the cover charge.    The next few days were pretty similar. I met this nice guy, Jose, and he told me where I could get cheap beer, and we talked. Every time I saw him after that we would talk for a while...just have good conversations.    We went to Chichen Itza as well...rented a car and drove out there. It was amazing how advanced the Mayans were. They had accurate calendars and they also had this amazing thing where you could stand near the temple, clap, and it the echo would make the sound of a sacred bird. A few days later we went to Tulum (which was right on the beach, also beautiful).    All the while, at nights, we would venture to the clubs. On the way there was this lady begging, and she had the most beautiful children, so I would give her money and have a little conversation with her every day. I also saw this cute little Mayan boy, Benito, selling bracelets, and I talked to him. I asked him his name, and where he was from...stuff like that. When I asked him how old he was he got kind of nervous...I think he was too young to be selling things. But we also became friends...we would talk when we saw each other on the street. Every night, even when we didn't go to Jose's bar, we would talk.    One day we went on this  Alltournative  thing. First we pedaled through the forest to a cenote (which is like a very clear sinkhole) and went snorkeling in that. It was amazing...the water was so clear you could see the bottom, which was, in places, 50 feet. Another cenote, not as amazing, but still better than a lot of the places I have been snorkeling, was visited. Then I went on three ziplines through the jungle. I have never done anything like that..ever...and I probably won't have the chance to ever again. After the zipline-ing we were blessed by a Mayan priest-type-guy, and then had a traditional Mexican lunch. It was an unbelievable time.    So now...I find myself at Jose's bar, downing margaritas and tequila shots with the skill of an accomplished drinker. Our waiter was the most handsome man I have ever seen in my life. This certain Argentinean, Fernando, had dazzling brown eyes, thick, curly, kind of longish hair, a perfect nose, and a charming smile. After a few drinks he asked me to dance and of course, after gazing at his beauty, I had to. So up I went, onto the bar, grinding and talking with the visual man of my dreams. Not only was he beautiful, but he was a great dancer, and a kind person. We talked and talked. I started stumbling around after a while because, as I stated, completely drunk. Fernando tells me that I, "don't have to worry, I wouldn't let a girl like you fall." After a few songs, and many many many shouts/whistles, I returned to my seat. Two more margaritas later I had made friends with all of the waiters in the bar. Completely drunk, I ended up kissing two of them (I'm pretty sure they made the first move, but, admittedly,I did not resist), and dancing with all of the others. Each one told me I had beautiful eyes/I was  bonita /that I had to return the next day. I even danced with Jose. One of the men that I drunkenly made out with looked like a Mexican mobster, with long curly hair, but a large smile. This man was quite a few years older than me, I am sure of it. But I must say, it was the best kiss/kisses I have ever had. I'm sorry, you white boys just can't compete.    Then I had to say goodbye to all the friends I had made. I hate being home without being able to flirt with Fernando and Jose. And poor Benito...I miss him. I miss them all. I miss being gazed at by everyone on the street.    I must return soon.    Oh and by the way, Jose gave me his e-mail address so hopefully we will keep in contact.
