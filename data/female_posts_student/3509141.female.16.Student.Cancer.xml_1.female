I'm sitting here, seem to be waiting for something, don't really know what, don't really care either.  I sometimes don't understand why people let some of the things get to them, they all seem upset, angry... sometimes i think it's not what's really happening, just what they think is happening, it's all a matter of reception.  now i sound like someone who has no problems, but trust me i do, we all do, but the point is not let the problems lead to other problems, the trick is how to solve it, scream, swearing are all just temporary methods people use, but the real problems still remains, i know i'm making it sound too easy, but the fact is that it's not that hard if you just jump out of the box.    i should be a phsycologist ( if i learn how to spell it first), it hurts me to see people struggling.
