I was so nervous that whole day since I had been gone alot all summer I hadn't had much time to practice so I was freaking out! Anyway so basically my day started off with a bunch of nerves, I tried to calm them by keeping myself busy doing chores and what not but that didn't really work, so I went online and looked up tips on how to play a better tennis match and stuff like that. Well as I was reading all of this information I came across a page that said something along the lines of "Is dehydration effecting your game?" So I read it and realized that it probably was, since the day before I had played tennis with my mom for an hour and hadn't had hardly any water at all that day **idiot**. So anyway I went and got my pink Starbucks water bottle (that I purchased in San Jose) and filled it with water, then I put it in the freezer and went out for a swim in the pool. Well it was a little too chilly for a swim so I came inside and did some streching excercises to loosen up before tryouts. That was pretty routine and sort of boring. Anyway after that my dad came to get me for tennis and I grabbed my racket, water bottle and purse then I headed out to the truck (nice truck, hell ya 2004 ford lariat 350 diesel, awesome!) So my dad drove me over to the school tennis courts and I was so nervous I was shaking, I asked my dad not to watch me because I get nervous when my parents watch me. Anyway yeah so I walked into the tennis courts and I knew a few of the girls so I socialized a bit, then we started warming up. Doing serves (my worst.) Then Coach Smith called all of us over to him to call out our names and ask us what we thought our level of ability was in terms of 1-10. I rated myself a 4. Haha. Anyway yeah, so then he matched us up with other girls in our ability range and we had to play them. Well I won my first game 6-2! It was awesome! So then he matched me up with another girl who had beat someone else and we played and I beat her 6-5! She was really nice though and tomorrow she has to do a match with another girl to see who gets the last spot on the team or something to that effect. Anyway yeah I walked over to Coach Smith and he told me I was on the team! Hurrah! I was so happy! Yeah so anyway I told my mom and my dad and they were really happy. Later that day (more like evening) my dad took my to get some school stuff then we went to Gart Sports and I got a cover for my racket, after that I went to another store and got a new shirt and some shorts and then my dad got some taco bell (bleh) and we talked for a little while. It was fun! Yeah so that was my great day! Today I have to go back to school to practice for the game we have next Tuesday! Insane...anyway yeah, I'm gonna get going now, see ya!!!!    Ciao, Danz
