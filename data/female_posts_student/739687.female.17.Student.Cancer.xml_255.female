So I gave up. Stupid I-net blows.  I should probably go to bed soon, because I have to wake up for kickboxing tomorrow morning.  Fun.  "I love to eat each and every sprinkle...as I watch the stars twinkle."~~~ You can thank Rachel for that lovely quote. Bah hah.  Well, I think I'm gonna go and probably sleep.  Live wildly, crazies. I'll talk to ya later.
