I want something farther away when I do my acting stuff. I don't necessarily want to be near the city, because NYC is known for its musicals...and I'm not a musical actress. Never have been.   I dunno...this is so hard. But I'm going to do it. I need to do it. I can't see myself doing anything else but acting. It's what I want, and it's what I love.   You don't find art, art finds you...it's so fucking true.   It sucks, lol, because it's a hard life...  But it's true, and I can't deny it anymore.   Blah. Now to memorize LOT'S of monologues.
