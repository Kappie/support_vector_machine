Well, it's actually taken from a book by Oscar Wilde, of the title "The picture of Dorian Gray".  The beautiful Dorian Gray who is just coming of age is painted by his friend and the portrait given to him as a gift.  He is jealous of the portrait because of its imperishable beauty, where as his own true face will both age and show the effects of his sin.  He wishes that the portrait instead might capture his aging and the effects of his sin and that he might live on unblemished.  Miraculously, after he breaks up with his fiancee because she had a bad night on stage, his portrait has a cruel smirk instead of its normal innocent smile.  Dorian realises what has happened, and immediately decides to repent and write to his fiancee, using the painting as a conscience through which he can keep himself pure because of the knowledge that his very soul will show up for all to see.   Unfortunately, his fiancee had already committed suicide, and on receiving this knowledge, he decides that it is merely a romantic shakespearean end to a romance, and decides to see his painting as a gift -- he can sin and age and not have to experience the effects.  The interesting thing is the whole sin thing worked into the story.  I was expecting the aging thing, but not the sin.  The interesting thing about the sin is that as the book progresses and you see how Dorian tries out different sins, throwing himself into one at a time; the actual sins that Oscar Wilde chooses to portray (and I haven't finished the book yet) are mostly sins of indulgence (well, what is sin but selfishness...?).  The indulgences so far could be those of any well-educated lover of knowledge -- he collects musical instruments from all over the world, he collects silks and brocades, he attends operas, he collects rare jewels, he indulges an interest in different medicines, he becomes intrigued with Catholic masses and so forth (although there are some references to him waking up in inns in a dodgy part of town...).  But even these 'mild' sins show themselves on the canvas of his soul.  It's pure self-indulgence that Oscar Wilde seems to be studying.  I wonder how the book progresses, whether what begins as a richman's self-indulgence will transform him into a totally self-centred individual that leads to grosser and grosser sin?  And what will Oscar Wilde portray as gross sin? Or does self-indulgence in whatever form lead to self-destruction (or portrait destruction)?  Although it is possible that Wilde is doing a Plato, taking both sides of the argument in his book in order to work through a premise until its final conclusion.  Dorian Gray makes some eloquent arguments on all that humankind has lost through its bitter self-denial through the ages.  I wonder what Wilde's purpose is in writing the book, and which stage of his life it was written -- in young idealism, or in old regret?
