At the same time, the church is behind him in prayers... spiritual covering... and there's this gal name Rhoda who is one of those behind-the-scene people... she heard knocks on the door and recognised that it's Peter's voice... but she didn't open the door immediately...Ok after the background, the main point of the msg is to open the door to allow God to enter as believing is not enuff, you hav to be ready to recieve...   Nothing much happen today... gonna stick to my TV and try doing my wrk... tt's for the last weekend alone... I miss Terence and I'm counting the last few days before he comes back...
