It is about realizing that some of people may be very important to you but they never noticed it. Just like how you inspire or how others value you without knowing it.   Then after few chews, I rememeber the story that read from a book. It is about a man who has barber for more than twenty years. They had a good barber-and-customer-casual-relatiionship. They shared stories everytime he visits his barber shop. They talked about father and everything in their lives. then the moment has come. The barber have to leave his place cause his family have a new house and they have to move for a reason. So he went off with his family.  Few weeks later, the man's hair is growing. He miss his old barber friend. Hi miss his monthly visit for a usual hair cut that he used to have since his hair was still brown. The barber may never know that this man miss him but for this man, there are things great things that you'll never notice. Unknowingly, he thank his barber for giving him a perfect shave and haircut. He thanked him for sharing his life stories with a simple customer like him. He thank him for being a good barber and a nice person.   Well, as I said you may never know how much you mean to others. How thankful they were in meeting a person like you. How you inspire them in your own little ways which seems simple to you. Many people know me whether a little aquaintance or a good friend. But most of them never knew how grateful I am for hearing my nonsense stories. For listening to my old nobody-loves-me-monologue and for laughing at my boring jokes. (coz I talk so soft and in minimal voice, and jokes don't look like jokes.ü). To all those people, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I really appreciate it whether you also do or don't. hehe.. And to those if there are some whom I inspired, (is there anything inspiring about me?) hehe... THANK YOU na rin po. I love you guys... whether you hear it or not it's precious cause I really mean it from my heart. ü
