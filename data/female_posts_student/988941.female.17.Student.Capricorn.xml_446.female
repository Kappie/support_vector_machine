For the following paragraph, replace the word 'cabage' with something that ryhmes with "ducking" and starts with "f". A terrible day. Tried to dig a cabage hole for a cabage plant in the cabage garden, but some cabage idiot built the cabage garden on cabage clay so I can only go about cabage 10cm. Another one of my cabage computers has decided that computer-cabage-life isn't just worth cabage living and is now sulking in the corner of the room not doing anything. I have a cabage head-ache and I can't cabage think straight. It's half past cabage eleven and I'm going to cabage bed.
