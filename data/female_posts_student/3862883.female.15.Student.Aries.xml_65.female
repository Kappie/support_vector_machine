In the movie Apocalypse Now the setting is in the Vietnam war. In the story it is not placed here but the stories are alike in another way other than this. In the movie the main character and the main character in the story in the Heart of Darkness are the same. Marlow and the special opps, General Fuller have a order or a job to do, to find something. They may be some what different but they both have the same drive to find what is going on in the jungle. The Thames River and that both of the men are meeting at this place. Also obviously that it is placed in a jungle. The setting is has the evil, dark, place to it. But these are the similarities that I have seen between the movie and the story so far.
