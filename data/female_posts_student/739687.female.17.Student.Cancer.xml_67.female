That's life...and how will you learn anything in life if you never have mistakes to learn off of anyway? I really hate when people try to make my decisions and their like "dont do that..it's a mistake.." and blah blah blah. If it's going to be a mistake, then I'd like to make it on my own. I'm a hands on person...I want to learn from my own mistakes, not everyone else's. I can accept making mistakes; I mean, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. I can live my own life, and I like that. Mistakes help people to learn, and often, they can make you a better person. And I know that first hand...because I've made mistakes, and I know better for next time. But there are things out there that I haven't done, and if I want to go out and do whatever I feel like, then so be it. I don't want people trying to stop me...if it's a mistake, I'll learn. But that's better than going through life just wondering...and not really knowing. I mean, what if something that I never did wouldn't have been a mistake? What if my only mistake was trying to avoid that "mistake"? I want to live life first-hand, not have other people live it for me. I think people should live more like that. I mean, I want to see every aspect, be every person, do everything, make EVERY mistake. Because then, I'll know who I really am, and what I really want to do with my life. It's kind of a self discovery thing. If you only take one road, and one path, then who knows what adventure and excitement you missed on all the others. To sum it up: Carpe Diem. Seize the day!
