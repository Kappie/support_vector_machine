Just wanted to share something I learnt today, that really spoke to me.  God used Gideon and he was just a farmer who doubted God and said “if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about? But now the Lord has abandoned us and put us into the hands of Midian” (Judges 6:13) Hey he thought like me!!  Then when God asked him to go and do this job he said “but Lord how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh and I am the least in my family” (again my thoughts) but God said to him “I will be with you and you will strike down all the Midianites together” He was a nothing, but God used him for amazing purposes.  Maybe there is hope for me yet! (Although God if you are listening to this, I don’t necessarily want you to use me in battle against thousands of Midianites – or their equivalent!)
