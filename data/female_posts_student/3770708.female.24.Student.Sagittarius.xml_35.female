Sometimes it means inconsolable sobbing, sometimes it means unpredictable chomps to delicate mama anatomy, and sometimes it means tearing around at top speed and lobbing objects at a haggard parent. Gavin chose this last option, becoming a raging wee monster as soon as he started getting tired this evening. He sped around the grocery store, ripping books off the shelves, throwing sponges and plungers into the aisles like a man in a chase scene, trying to throw off his attacker. He shrieked and went limp when picked up, oozing from my grip and puddling onto the floor before springing up for a speedy escape. At home, I plunked him bodily into the bathtub, yelping in surprise and anger as he scooped up a cup of water and dashed it in my face violently. Determined to soothe the savage beast, I sang him love songs and rubbed his back with lavender baby wash, firmly stopping him from his repeated attempts to spit water over the edge of the tub. I held him down and brushed his teeth, noting grimly the white bulge of gums where his latest tooth threatens to break free. After half an hour of nursing, his kicks to my stomach became less and less frequent, his nipple tweaking subsided, until, at last, the plastic teletubbie rolled from his limp fist and he was asleep. Wet, bruised, and hoarse, I staggered downstairs, and here I sit. I can't believe some toddlers are like this every day. I am so lucky that our battles are, thus far, contained to the rare days when he is cutting a tooth, with months of peace and love making up the balance. I don't see how other mothers refrain from chucking their children out the window if they have to deal with this every day.  Good heavens. At least he was charming for the first part of the day, even bestowing me with three unsolicited kisses. I just hope he is able to sleep comfortably tonight, because my mother goes back to work in the morning, and there will be no help for me if I'm too tired. Must sleep.
