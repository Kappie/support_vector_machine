So that is the reason for the abrupt ending, and if you don't like it you can write an ending yourself and post it as a comment! Actually, that would be very much a fun thing to do because it would be a bit like Mad-libs or those choose-your-own-adventure books(series) Goodness, I must be going insane with summer boredom! Well it's not that long until August---right? Summer is my favorite season, well, I love all seasons but summer is the most freeing time of year for me. Except this year I feel like an animal in a cage. The only thing I am getting out for is a singing mini-tour in New York from August 5-9 and then this coming saturday I may go see The Redwalls in concert! And that's it. Oh, and my birthday is August 20th, but who knows if anything special will happen this year. I had a suprise party last year, but they're a bit overrated (sp?) especially when your mother palns them. *Sigh* *Another sigh* I really need to get out--maybe I'll go somewhere and spontaneously make new friends!..........yeah right, who am I kidding--if I can't even talk to someone I've known all my life on the phone then how can I ever spontaneously make friends with random people face-to-face? Well, there is that certain excitement about making an impression--whether it's good or bad. I am writing so much today! I think I really must be going insane or at least I'm experiencing withdrawl of not even being able to use AIM  IM people kind of like a real face-to-face conversation. That brings to mind the fact that I have not had an actually meaningful conversation with someone in a long time...actually since school ended and my Critical thinking/"gifted" class in high school ended. I miss that class. I think I had probably the most amazing/brilliant/fun/kind teachers in the world with whom you could have the most philosophical conversations with just as soon as you said hello to them. Even people in my gifted class, some of them were like that, it was like there was a deeper understanding that just a meaningless conversation. I like that, especially when you can't really describe something amazing that you realized (like time  relativity  such things as those) and they can still understand but on a much deeper level. I love that--and I'm glad that I'll be seeing most of them next year.  Wow, as I read over this I come across as selfish and an unecessary banterer (if there is such a title). My humble apologies, and I hope you do not think this how I really am. I just need to vent a bit. But this is too much I'm writing so I will save the rest for my written journal and spare all of you (and conserve space)
