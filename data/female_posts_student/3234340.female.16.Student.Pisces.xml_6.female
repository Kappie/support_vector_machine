I think that's the last time I'll hear from him until Saturday, bc he'll be at sea for the next 2 days. I miss him so much! It made me soo happy to talk to him yesterday, but it just kinda depressed me to talk to him today, because its still gunna be soo long until i get to see him, or at least soo long in my world. Gah, I must sound crazy, or obsessed, or something, but I'm just in love..hmm...i unno. This week has just been dragging by...at least tom me and ashley are gunna go do something... that'll at least get me outta the house besides babysitting, which i might add, i am dreading friday! i like them right after they wake up and after lunch, thats when they're easiest to deal with, but its not like i can just quit because i dont like it.. i agreed to do it and at least i get paid for it...
