Blaine suggested Sexified, but I don't think that people would get the joke.   my little song  In my little head I thought about all she said Everything, everything that I heard everything from her first word to her last word  It comes to me now that I can't cry not even if I try her thrust is nothing but a push against my heart  Her empty words  Make empty wounds Bleeding empty blood Doesn't it hurt?
