I pointed ahead -- ahead of myself as well as you." - George Bernard Shaw  Because of its essential completeness, it is difficult to make constructive comment on this quote, other than to say it is amazingly thoughtful, thought-provoking, and well-worded, and it beautifully illustrates the progression of two eternal and essential parts of our existence: knowledge and learning.
