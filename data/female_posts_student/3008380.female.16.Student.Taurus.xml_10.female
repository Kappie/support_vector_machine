Mom said she's going to find a rust bucket for me to drive, Uncle Jon said one of his friends has a $600 caddy he's trying to sell, so we are looking at that right now. Things could be worse. At 4:45 I get to go feed the homeless for 3 hours. Big whoop. It's not bad, I need to do some community service, I'm just too lazy to do it. GRR! Tomorrow is Joely's birthday! Yay! We get to go cruise around and eat pie! Yum! And we can go make a mess for Hergie to clean up. God, I hate that kid.
