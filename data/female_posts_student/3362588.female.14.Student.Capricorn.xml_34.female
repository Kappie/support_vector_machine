I supose the other girls who went would slap me if they heard me say it was just good, but they don't really have any other camp experiences to compare it too.  The camp grounds were pretty basic.  Really basic.  We stayed in bug infested barns, which wasn't as bad as it sounds.  Played crazy games and rock repelled.  Games like Ultimate Frizbee with a frozen ham.  haha.  Fun stuff like that.  The preacher dude was really boring, I thought.  The only night that was something like interesting was when he preached on purity.  He got pretty fired up.  The music team was awesome.  Great stuff.    I found this totally nifty site where you can get themes for your computer.  http://www.themexp.org/  Pretty cool.  Lots of mac themes and stuff.  Nifty.  So yeah..... Nothing mucho else to say.  Except I'm sooooo tired I could.... i don't know what I could do, but I'm totally tired.    Signing off- Ja.... *yawn*....CK
