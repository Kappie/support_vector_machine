It srarted Monday early morning and we got there and put our stuff in our rooms. Then we went straight to our first rehersal where we learned the song "Footloose" and these crazy dance moves. Then they did and audition thing where we had groups of 5 and we had to perform on the stage. Then we did they groups of 5 thing againa nd sang a song. Then we had lunch, which was pretty good. I am thinking I had pizza.  Then they cast the roles. laura didn't get a part but she was happy because the people who had parts had to work way harder than the rest of us.  Then...hours later. The scene: A funny old dorm room. Two girls, Karsen and Laura, try to sleep with no luck. They sleepily talk about life.  Karsen says in an exhausted voice "What if you scared your grandpa and he died, would yoou get in trouble?"  Laura responds cluelessly "What are you talking about Karsen?" then go into spasms of laughter.  [More conversation continues]  [door knocks]  A leader like figure enters "Girls, lights out was 2 hours ago, get to sleep!"  Girls respon in unison "Okay."  Hahahha. That was weird.  Laura's stupid qutoe for the day [monday] "Is this the improv room?"    [Story time]  So it was like our little free time kinda thing [which I was mistaken,read on]Bekah siad somethign about having a fun time just to play improv games and I love improv so I was like "Woohoo!"  so I went and changed into my pink barbie like outfit and went to where Improv was supposed to be. I was really hyper so I push the door open and I was like "IS THIS WHERE IMPROV IS?" and they was a huge group of CYT people having a Bible Study. Hahahah. [it was funnier in real life] I felt really  blonde because everyone was having "God moments" and here comes Laura, the freak, "IS THIS IMPROV?" everyone laughed. Hahaha.   Hmm  Then we woke up and it was Thursday. We rehersed like ALL Day. Then we ate some.  And then we had a bible study.  Most of the days were the same.  But I figured out a lot fo stuff about myself.  Like how I don't fit in anywhere.  I figured out that the reason I never fit in is so I can be friendly to the new people or the people who don't have friends.  I figured out a ton of other stuff which I tried to share at the "share time" this morning but it didn't make sense and I bet everyone thought I was a jerk. Haha. I said something like "I used to think that only a few people deserved my love" and everyone was like ":o" and I was like "alrighty...sitting down now." That always happens when I try to say somethign amazing, it comes out all wrong!!   Hmm..  i am going ot go to friday.  So we all got into our awesome 80s outfits. Me, Karsen, and Katie ehad had the BEST COSTUMES.  Christina and her loyal followers didn't do like anything I was like "this is theatre, go crazy!" and Janelle [the dance instuctor] was like "The Barbies didn't do anything to there hair" I was like "I LOVE YOU JANELLE" I didn't realize that about her until the last day, which was sad. I always thought she liekd the pretty people more because she was always putting them in the front of the stage. [I know..I think weird thoughts] I mean really, I was always placed in the back. Shoudl I take the hint?  but then, when Janelle said that I relaized that we kind of had the same mind. It made me smile.  We had a rehersal then it was time for our performance. it went super welll!! I only messes up like 3 times!!! Go LAURA!! Christina messed up more than me so I was like "Hah!!" It made me super happy. Gosh, I am being mean to her again. STOP LAURA.   But. What. I CAN'T TALK. I am trying to go into a subject that had been bothering me  all week but I can't put it into words. It was just this moment that made me like start totally crying in front of everyone. Not like they could see it or anything. Over the years I have learned to hide my emotions.  So, Tim Head [sheriff] was singing his "Heaven" solo and I was just like staring at him and I heard this voice in my head and it just kept going over and over saying "You're going to marry Tim Head" and I was like "Yeah right whoever you are. You obviously don't know that Tim is like the most gorgeous guy in the entire world. I mean davis times 10,000" and then it was like "What makes you think your not good enough for him. you deserve him."  it freaked me out.  I am just going to put it aside and just  make myself think I was just of in my own little world trying to make myself feel better by saying that.  It was just weird.  I mean it's not liek I wouldn't absolutely love to marry Tim...it's just like I am not worthy of him.  And I am totally not putting myself down.   I cried a lot this week, but no one saw. Like I said, I hide my emotions. Like when everyone was sharing and stuff the tears just started pouring.  A lot of people think I am very unemtional but I am like the most emotional girl EVER.   But guess what. I observed a lot this week and I have offically decided I am a JERK.  I'm out.
