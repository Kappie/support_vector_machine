I cut my hair last night...so now in addition to the Bettie Page bangs, it's overall length is around my chin again. Something about the heat and humidity here in Georgia that keeps me from being able to grow this mess out...that and the painful tangles that constantly plague my wild tresses. Haven't dyed it yet...I'm actually contemplating either leaving it alone for now or dying it to match my roots (minus the silver highlights, of course) since they're starting to show. Bleh. I have to head over to the financial aid office as soon as they open in a few hours to get my aid paperwork straightened out to see if summer semester is even a viable option...for if it's not, what's the point of meeting my advisor this afternoon? I'm hoping this all goes through, though because I owed $500 on my student account because they erred and gave me extra aid for spring...and then told me I had to pay it back a couple of weeks ago. Thanks for the advance notice guys. I asked about getting a student loan to pay it back but they said I'd have to a) borrow the money from someone  pay it off, b) apply for the loan,  c) then pay back whomever I borrowed from when I get the loan. Fucked up, I know. So I got my dad to loan me the money since my grandmother and I aren't on the best of terms right now. I guess if the loan thing doesn't work out I'll bite my lip and work for my aunt for a few weeks to make the money. I'm just lucky that he's giving me until classes start next month to pay him back since I owe a couple of other people some money right now.
