Now all they care about is their honda 4WDs and plasma screen TVs. It's all one big competition... but it aint gonna make them happy. They frustrate me... never do anything to help others or their problems or what goes on in the world, its all about whos got the shinest car or ring, or new TV or rennovation. Ha - the CRV that hasnt left paradise (the streets of corlette) - of course they  need  that leather interior. They live in a bubble... and they arent interested what happens down here - after all, we don't live in corlette so what does it matter? guh! they have such... unfulfilled lives.  I'm sick of people having no priorities! They are just happy to sit back and pretend the worlds problems don't exist...  Money just screws everything over. it's why my stupid rellos are so pretentious. it's why i lost my job - wow max you get extra money of tafe. nevermind the chick u hired is a total ditz. Now i don't know what to do. i dont have enough time and energy to spend finding a new job! I'm doing my HSC for beeps sake. But i hate having to get my money from my parents. My dads dead set against it, but my mum said she'd give me money. I hate this! i don't want to be a charity case :( and i want to be  independent ... but i got thrown out on my ass. I spose i have to accept help from my mum... but i feel like such a scab.  I hate this!!!
