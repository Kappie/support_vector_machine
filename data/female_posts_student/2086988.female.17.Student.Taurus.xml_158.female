Too bad my log mananger didn't save the convo, but I'm sure Kiera would believe her best friend. First off, this asshole IMs me and demands that I call Kiera and tell her to get online. I'm like WTF? Dude you don't even know me. So I'm like umm no, if you want to talk to Kiera you can call her. "oh I don't have any minutes." Well sucks for you then buddy. I then ask the obvious question, "do you like Kiera?". "yea". "So then why don't you go out with her?" "oh I don't do long distance relationships." He fucking goes to UT in ARLINGTON! What, isn't that like a 45 minute drive at most and his family does live in McKinney, so it's not like he won't be back. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want Kiera to go out with him under any circumstances, but his justification for not wanting to go out with her, SUCKS. If you want to try a long distance relationship, try 600 miles, mmmk?   Anyways, I finally just go off, saying he's using Kiera and he's all like that's your opinion. Yes mine and everyone else's. He knows Kiera is weak, that she has bad self esteem. But she's too blind to realize this and he knows it. He drops her after Winter Ball and then all of a sudden they're at it again? I told him that she really likes him and that all he wants his to get some and that he probably has like 10 other girls. He goes "yea and she can go with any guy too." HELLO? She likes you, she doesn't want anyone else. He basically just told on himself there, yeah he's TOTALLY not using her...It's really sad when you have 3 people simutaneously yelling at him and he blocks all of us, yeah really mature. So that's all the proof you need there for that.   Now, let's get to tonight. Kiera asks if I've talked to Joe. I told her he IMed me yesterday wanting to talk to her. But I didn't say I went off on him. And I asked her if she had talked to him today. "No" she said, "he hasn't been online, he has on his cell, but I don't want to bother him during class." I'm sure this fool doesn't have class at 8pm especially during a summer session. But, here's the cherry topper! She told Allison during this same time period, that she did talk to Joe and in fact that they are "going out". See, what exactly did I miss here? She had just told me that she knows no one likes Joe, esp me and that I was looking out for her. I was thinking that I was finally getting through. But nooooo. She goes behind my back.   Kiera has a bad rep, since she did all that stuff with Brian (BJ) and Josh last summer, it's gotten around school. And Em's ex, Chris is good friends with Joe, who informed Joe of Kiera by Embry in which he knew to call her for a good time. I'd rather be a nobody then be known as a slut. She asked me the other day why guys always ask her to do things...umm DUH...yeah. Why can't she just find a nice guy? It's not that hard. All the guys she lkes are the ones that are total players and just want to use her. If she just acted normal she would find the right guy.   Tomorrow, I'm going to give her an ultimatum, either drop Joe and change or I'm not going to be there for you when you need me. I know what's going to happen, she's going to get her heart-broken or end up in some serious shit and I'm won't be there. I told her so and if she won't listen to what I have to say then she's on her own. Hopefully mine and Ritika's talk tomorrow will change all this. I want the old Kiera back, the one who is fun to hang out with and is not on the phone or net with guys all night. I can only hope and pray we get through to her tomorrow, for her own good. I don't want to see her hurt.    you've come so far since that time when you let your first boy in and you do it so carelessly as if you had no self esteem a victim of apathy but you don't care what people say about you i will let you in before you break yourself
