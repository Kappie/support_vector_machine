It was located right in the middle of the old Johor Bahru town, on a slope. It was a typical old colonial bungalow you find around Malaysia, with the old window designs and that old smell you can never get rid of, not that you’d want to anyway.  The house was owned by the church we attended, Holy Light Presbyterian. And so when my dad joined the pastoral team, we were given an offer to stay to at 4G since it pretty near church. The senior pastor was the former resident and soon after he moved into his own house, we moved into 4G.  It wasn’t a pretty looking house when we first moved in. Sure, it had its old, cozy English look, but the huge rambutan tree was unkempt and the orchids planted around the compound looked horrendous with charcoal around the plant. There were 2 mongrels left behind by the pastor and his missus, Brown and Tiger, both female and extremely lovable. It was quite some months before we got the house up. Dad did some thorough work in the garden and soon he had some vegetable plants at the back, and loads of flowers up in front. The dogs used to dig up the plants and every morning, I would cringe at the sound of Brown howling when dad caned her. Haha, oh gosh, we caned our dogs.  We had a cat named Oscar, which we brought over from our Taman Suria house over to 4G. I doubt Oscar was used to living with two boisterous female dogs, but the dogs sure enjoyed him! When we moved, we drugged Oscar for a few hours, and when he woke up, we decided to let him out of the mobile cat kennel thing. Drowsily, he fumbled out and walked onto the grass, smelling cautiously around. When suddenly two huge brown furry things which smelt real bad came sniffing him, spraying saliva all over. THEY WERE DOGS!!!! Goodness you should have seen Oscar run. Never have I seen a cat run that fast. And he ran up the rambutan tree, not knowing whether they were anymore of these brown furry wet things around. That, I bet was the first time too that Oscar had ran up a tree. Me, being the lover and fusser of Oscar, checking on him every half an hour, and he refused to come down. I remember very clearly, he stayed up in that tree for 8 hours. Nah, we didn’t call the firemen.  That time, when we had moved to 4G, my bro had grown up and wasn’t so keen on playing guns and shooting stray cats with me anymore. He was in form 4 and had begun hanging out with the young adults from church. So I was left to look for companions to share my childhood curiousity with. My two neighbours Nina and Melissa were the ones. Strange though, what we used to do.. You’d never believe it. We used to make pancakes together and figure out weird recipes for our poor parents to try, or if it turned out horrible, we’d take it over to the Istana Gardens nearby and feed it to the ducks in the pond. Hehehehee.. Sigh, memories.. We would often go down to the Malay warung for breakfast too, the pak cik knew us well. His lontong was superb man. ;)  Besides that, we would just play our normal stuff, talk our girlie stuff and go to the old library up the hill every once in a while. They didn’t dare go too often because their photos were pinned up on the ‘Didn’t return library books’ section. Haha, killer times lah.  Back then, my parents let me out by myself more often. Nowadays, and I’m 15+ mind you, and I can’t even cycle round the next street. Sad betul… When my bro was in a happier mood, he’d take me for walks thru the nearby Malay kampung at the back of my house, then we’d go see the cemetery and the guy who carved the tombstones. Before going back, we would of course, buy some kuih kadok (toad kuih) before going back home. Hahaha. Most of the time, my brother would be out cycling by himself. Once, on Easter Day, he fell off his bike on a slope and broke two of his teeth. He breaks a lot of bones, don’t worry.  The house at the top of the hill had been doing renovations and leaving piles of sand by the roadside. So during the rainy season, it would wash the sand down to our road and since it blocked the drains, our whole house would get flooded. We used to curse that house a lot because after the flood cleared, wah, our house compound was one muddy swamp. And it happened quite a few times.  More on 4G later, have to study.
