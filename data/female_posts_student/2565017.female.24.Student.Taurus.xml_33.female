I washed laundry, washed dishes, vacuum cleaned, dusted, washed windows, changed bed sheets... anything you can imagine cleaning.  Then, I was invited to Anne's, to pack up her van with her stuff. She probably won't be with us the next semester. Not if she can transfer to a school closer to her boyfriend and the house they're building together. I wish nothing but the best of luck for her, but at the same time I wouldn't want her to go.  Well, Tatu's probably leaving too... so... we packed most of their stuff to Anne's van (she's going to make a little detour for Tatu and take his stuff to Tampere, to his girlfriend's place, at the same time as moving her stuff away) and we'll continue packing tomorrow. It was fun too, cracking jokes and spending a little time together.  Hmm... tomorrow I have only 1 class. 1! What's that supposed to be, pyh... Well, I appreciate the free time, I need it. I need to write a couple of assignments.... and... read for exams, majorly.  I think I'll go sleep soon, it's early wake-up tomorrow, I still need once machineful of laundry to wash. at 8 am.... I wonder if I'll want to wake up for it or just think "ahhh, I'll wash them some other time...zzzzz" :)  zzzzzzzzz.....
