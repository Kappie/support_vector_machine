Well, I wrote her a letter to see if she'd bring Knightettes back since the second levy passed and it's not back. I think it's really convincing, especially since my mom's friend Nicole wants to coach us! I know Heather's interested, I doubt Carolann would be but you could do it with us ((!)), and Ray you probably are but I need to know.    When I have the meeting w/ Principal Miller before the new year I want to be able to tell her how many girls would do it. Rach, if you would could you ask Vicky, KC, Julia, Hali, and whoever else if they'd want to do it? Thanx in advance. I REALLY wanna do this and she won't unless she really thinks enough girls would want to. Trust me, Nicole's been in dance since before high school and she still dances in competitions. She can do this if we want her to. Everyone loves our moves Ray, let's get serious about it! Heather's in already, yay Heather!!! I'll CALL and ask Carolann.
