I did get my paycheck awhile back which made me wonder about the longevity of social security. Um, how long will it last? With all the political analysts and people in that crowd complaining about the government deficits and the Bush administration, I now wonder if the $21 deducted for social security and Medicare will ever be returned to my possession. So... Maybe I should major in economics when I'm in college?  Speaking of which... I need to update my senior resume for my counselor, like what I did during the summer and what not. Oh, and one of the funnier things in college planning: keep track of the process. Hmm, what am I supposed to write? I really want to get into UPENN or Yale and I am worried that I will be out of town again when the Yale representatives come? And..Ohoh yes, my various new additions to my already long list of colleges to apply for. Oh dearie... It's already getting stressful.
