I dont know. Life is wierd right now. I'm not sure where I stand on anything. School, family, girlfriends, boyfriends. It's like a wierd transition period for everything. I want everything to be as it was, or as I always wished it was... depends on what subject we're talking about. I just want things to be .. normal. Whatever that is. I want to feel like I matter to somebody. I hate drama, I hate my friends being mad at me, or being mad at them. I feel like I'm long overdue for a heartfelt talk with every single friend I have. Am I not making time for them or are they not making time for me? I want to paint. I wish I had the energy and time and patience to do art all day, for hours, and have something come out of it. I wish college wasn't so close. And yet I don't want to wait anymore. Charlotte, Erinn, we have to have one of those stupid girl nights and see Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. Don't pretend that you don't want to see it. Lol. One of those nights where you stay up til the sun comes up and the birds are chirping because you talk all night about absolutely everything. Talk about Erinn's recent indiscretions with a certain BOY (yes boy). I wish it was last year. I wish it was next year. I wish it was summer and I was going to burton, or coulon beach. or newcastle beach. Or charlotte's house. Or caitlin's house. And I still have to see a rated R movie! I'm 17 now, god dammit. But tomorrow's another day. jgi;ajgie;ajg;;baiejuoiwae;fjjakncxm,z You heard me.
