Minor detail that i hadta get up around 10 and get ready for work! Had a nice long shift today of 7 hours.  Was originally my only day working this week but i needed more so now i have some hours tomorrow! *score*  Got to see caitlin today cuz she had lifeguard training, haha what a great class im sure--the pple seem uh..interesting.   I've feeling kinda out of it. It's weird and i dont know, swore i wouldnt get too personal on here so i wont! Plus itd be hard to describe.  Anyways, working tomorrow, getting to see caitlin, gonna do something with laney soon, and gotta go see the notebook with christine.  And i really needta go see fahrenheit..AH! so much to do.  Actually its not really but ill keep myself busy.  I always do.  Al Lapin jr, cofounder of ihop, died..how sad.  The guy who came up w/ that silly chalet style for a pancake house.
