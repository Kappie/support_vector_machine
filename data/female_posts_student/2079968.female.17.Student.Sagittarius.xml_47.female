I've literally been inside this house and haven't left it since tuesday evening...like...4 or 5 days...  Man people should read this if they wanna know what's going on with me...  I've got 2 readers...steven and laura...that's it...andrew doesn't even read this crap when he's online.  Poor pathetic me, huh...?  I am such a brat and a drama queen.    I love this thing because it allows me to be so egocentric.  Now, I am leaving.
