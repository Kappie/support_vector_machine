He fussed and cried only because we had to hold his head. Thank you G'ma Jan! Awesome job.    Today Nick and I had another 1st...we ventured to the Whole Foods Co-op and got Soy Ice Cream and teething biscuits. Nick has been teething like crazy. He was up almost all night long. I was so crabby by the time 6 rolled around and I was up. Poor Shawn-I took out my frustrations out on him because I can't take them out on Nick. I need to find a better way to vent...maybe meditaton or yoga of some sort.    It is so hot  humid outside right now. I miss Shawn more than ever. I am so lonesome for my husband. I think Nick is, too.
