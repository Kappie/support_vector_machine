So far I've had an ex boyfriend tell me he's in love with me, 2 say they were living in Orlando now, and 1 tell me that I'm going to hell. AOL Instant Messenger, how I missed you!  Finals are this week. Wish me luck. Then it's time for website updates,digital pictures, more frequent blogging, and maybe even a clean house! Exciting stuff to come!
