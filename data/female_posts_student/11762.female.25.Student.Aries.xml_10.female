I did not keep a scrapbook full of pictures of rings, dresses, and cakes. In college, when I first discovered feminism, I proclaimed at the top of my lungs that marriage was a patriarchal institution and there was no way that I was going to willingly participate in the ultimate downfall of women. Yet, the entire time that I went through that militant phase I had a dirty little secret.  I wanted to be married. I wanted to fall in love with a man.  Now, I am older and a bit wiser. I recognize that I can be both, a feminist and a wife. In the last few weeks, I have been contemplating this topic, mostly because I have a great number of friends who either are married or are engaged to be married. I find myself turning into one of those women; clipping dresses and rings out of magazines, thinking about ceremonies, but most of all looking for the ever elusive  Mr. Right . My feminist self knows that such a creature does not exist. I am too cynical to believe, truly, in faerytales. I am no longer viewing the world through child-like eyes. However, the hopeless romantic in me will not stop looking for this individual.  I would be lying if I said that I was not ready for love. I would love to be in a relationship with a man, a committed union with someone who wanted to spend his life with me. The problem is that I am not ready to give up all of the things that I would, most likely, need to sacrifice in order to be with this person; traveling abroad, working in Washington D.C., getting my doctorate. I am not sure if I am ready to be that unselfish with my time and energy.  What is problematic about this situation is that I give my heart away with too much ease. I am a hopeless romantic and caring for other people is second nature to me, not because I am a woman, but because I am me. It is a seamless part of my identity that I can not divorce from other parts of my life. I crave a partner, a companion, like most of the world. I want to fall in love with a man who would be willing to move to another city/state/country for my career. I want to be involved with a man who is my best friend and loves me because of my flaws and not in spite of them.  The hard part about contemplating issues, such as this one, over which I have no control is that I am afraid of the hard, realistic possibility that I may never find this individual. However, I have faith that things will follow the path that they are meant to travel. In the meantime, I am going to take a deep breath and focus on taking life one day at a time.
