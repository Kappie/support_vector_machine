That was not what i had aimed to do, but one thing, stop being so padantic and masterful over 'YOUR BLOG' WHICH YOU OWN PERSONALLY. No one likes that. Just calml down a bit and everything will be ok. Its nice to hear from you Andy, and nice to see you chose to blog, and didnt get a detention or solatry confinment from the 'master of the blog' the 'supreme leader of us all'. I hope everyone who went had a good time at 'Harry Potter' and i once again apolagise for not being able to make it. I hope you are all well and enjoying the rather 'heated' discussions, of late.  Talk to you all soon, Dave
