Hmm...feeling...very peaceful today. I'm just quite optimistic that things are going to take a turn for the better. I just have...this feeling. And God I hope it's right. Things are starting to make sense. Things are starting to get simpler. And simplicity is just perfect.  I just want to be different.  Cuz I'm not happy with who I am.  There are times when everyone rushes in and tries to be the hero. And then there are times when you really need someone to save you.  I'll leave it at that. Bye crazies.
