The purple turned to a grey white.    Do you remember when you started to understand symbolism?  I was fairly little and my family was going to a wedding.  My mom and dad wrapped the present and I brought out some dried roses that I had to decorate the top.  My parents said no way.  For me they were a dried treasure, carefully kept.  To my parents, the death of the flower is what stood out.  When they explained to me that a rose is love, and a dead one is not a good sign, then I began to understand symbols.    Think of when we were barely literate in symbol systems, when things just were.  The world was a literal moment, devoid of hidden meaning because we did not give it hidden meaning.  Now, a word is more powerful, covered in not only cultural meaning, but seeped in the dust of our own experience.  Like when love was just for family, and dog, and cat.  Then it spread, became more.  It became enjoyment of things- strawberries and light and music.  It became sex and longing, sweaty moments of undiscovered palpitation.  Eventually it became all these things and an undertook of pain, fear of being without, nostalgic sighs and a memory of possibility.  Layers and layers.  In most other languages there is more then one word for love.  There is love of friends, love of a lover, love of family, love of a thing or activity, love of your baby.  Love for every occation.  In our culture we  have only one word, that is suppose to mean all things.  I think it cheapens the word, makes it ring less true and deep.  When you can say, "I love that commercial!" and you can say, "I love you."  Well, that's just not right.  Now my love has to encompass so much that is trivial, and so much that is the basis for heart ache, and so much joy.  How can we expect to understand each other in this world, with this barrier of meaning?  And what does it say about a culture that has this one love, but it has a plethora of very specific words for fight, war, battle.  I know, I just looked them up.  The words that we are given for love, are not really love at all.  But the words for fight, for attack, for destroy... Well they are numerous.    I need a warm day and a sunset that makes things look clear and red.  I also need to go to class...
