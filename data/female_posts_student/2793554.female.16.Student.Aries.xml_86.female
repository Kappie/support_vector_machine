I wish i had piercing needles, i wonder if me and melissas clamps came yet. ::shrug:: I wish i had a piercing liscense too, so i wont fuck up and paralyze things when i pierce myself/people.  blah! my tummy hurts.   My life is hectic and confusing.  ::yawn::  haha, jessies dad asked if she was drunk "cause she looked funny"  "you look funny. are you drunk?"  haha.   ABBY
