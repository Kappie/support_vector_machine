Well, actually, I didn’t get rid of them, they graduated so they were out of my hair and I started making amends with my love.  I tried to get everything back to the way they were, before I cheated.  I kept saying to myself, maybe if she wasn’t such an insensitive asshole who always ran out of money and got sick all the time, I wouldn’t have cheated on her.  If she didn’t take me for granted, the thought of kissing someone else other than her wouldn’t have crossed my mind.  We weren’t having enough sex, which is not to say that sex was the end-all and be-all of our relationship. She just wasn’t as sweet as before, like when she-snagged-me-from-someone-else before. Since I was the guilty party, I tried to forget that her insensitivity and lack of creativity led me to cheat on her.  Come on, cheating is cheating. When you hurt someone you love, you break their trust and unfortunately, trust isn’t won back that easily even if you break into Tracy Chapman’s Baby, Can I Hold You Tonight.  And even if it was the other person’s omission that led you to break that trust, the fact remains, you folded. Folded badly, I did.  That was 2002.  Things were different the year later. I tried so hard to make it up to her.  I bought her stuff, I fed her, I loaned her money, and I took care of her when she was sick.  Things were exactly the way they were before I cheated, except for the cheating part.  I was sweet and caring and everything.   Sometimes I thought, "Why the hell am I doing this? She was the one who wanted to get back together immediately after my big boo-boo, she was the one who said that things would be different, that she’ll be sweeter and more sensitive, that we’ll start from scratch, that’s everything’s forgiven and forgotten and shit like that.  She only realizes how important I am when I’m important to somebody else.  But every time I point out that she’s not doing her part or that nothing really changed, it always comes up.  It always has to come up like some big excuse she finds convenient to use when she’s an asshole.  There is a prevailing doctrine in law,  the principle of   estoppel . It goes: one should speak when he ought to speak and should be silent when he ought not to speak.   I remember it clearly, because, she is estopped from using that excuse on me.  She could’ve not taken me back. I mean, I cheated and I didn’t want to get back together right away because it was my fault. I wanted her to get mad and ignore me and treat me like shit ‘coz I deserved it.  But she didn’t, she took me back.  A year later, when I’m kicking my butt so hard just to please her and I’m just asking for a little respect or appreciation, I get this?  She met her student-dentist in 2003. We were all fourth year students at the time.  They became really close. So close, my girlfriend’s gift to this girl was the exact same gift she gave me on our month-sary (a bottle of strawberry daiquiri) except, hers was gift-wrapped and mine was in 7-11 plastic.  I had chocolates, she didn’t have any chocolates, but they spent the afternoon together.  Dental appointment :)  I come home late at night and she wouldn’t bother to ask me where I was or if I was safe but she had time to text her dentist that she was okay :(  and other shit like that.  Being the blabbermouth that I am, I kept complaining.  I’m a jealous girl. Weird huh?  I flirt with everyone but when my girlfriend does it, I get jealous of everybody.  We were arguing all the time.  She kept saying, “ You always accuse me of doing something behind your back when I’m not even doing anything.    I trusted you and you screwed up!”  It’s funny how the past has its way of getting back to the present.  When I was cheating on her, I told her I wanted to have time alone for myself when I was  actually with somebody else.  She didn’t really give me that time to think.  When I was with that other person, my mind was clear.  I had an opportunity to realize how unhappy I was with my girlfriend, even if I didn’t want to admit it because I was so in love with her to actually see it.  I was mean, I was bad, I hurt her so bad, and I know that.  But that was two fucking years ago.  When she finally broke up with me, November 10, 2003, that’s what she said.  She needed time to think for herself, that she hasn’t completely gotten over what I did and that she needed to be away for a while and I let her.  It’s actually very hard to stay away from a person with whom you share a sorority, a band and all your classes together but I shooed away from her because that‘s what she wanted.  Of course, I could’ve bugged her the same way she bugged me when I needed to be alone.  I could’ve stalked her to death the way she was at our house  everyday , I could’ve threatened to kill myself the way  she did  or tell  her folks  what their only daughter was doing with another  person’s daughter the way she did.  But I didn’t.  I backed off.  I was sooo busy blaming myself, kicking myself in the butt for something I did two years ago that it never occurred to me that  she was cheating on me . She did to me the exact same thing I did to her:  she broke up with me to be with dentist :(  Why did I not see that?   Every now and then I see them in the library, studying.  They look so cute I want to shoot them.  But I don’t.  I don’t.  They should be happy, they should be.  I mean, her breaking my heart should be worth something, right?  They should live happily ever after. Because if I’m hurting, if I’m miserable and having difficulty studying because I see the two of them together or because people won’t let go of the fact that we’re not together anymore ( our public is still experiencing withdrawal symptoms ),  they should be happy, right?  ‘Coz if I’m miserable and they’re still not fucking happy, then fuck them!  They’re asking for too much. I ain’t gonna pick her up when she falls again.  I was doing that even before we got together and all three years that we were together.  I told her the first time I cut my hair really short that I was getting rid of my demons. By demons, I meant, the two people I cheated with, I got them out of my system.  After my graduation, I cut my hair really short again. It was a sign she knew very well.  Days later, she cut her hair really, really shorter than mine :)
