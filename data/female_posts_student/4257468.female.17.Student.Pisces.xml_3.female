From what I can see, it looks like those of you who followed the email link are on and those who didn't aren't.  I will try to figure out how to fix this.  Meanwhile, could those of you who DIDN'T follow the link go back and try to follow it.  It might be that the system simply has to make the connection.  Try this and see what it does.  Thanks!
