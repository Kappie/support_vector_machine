Yongjie  and i might be workin on our homework together. hopefully he is able to make it. besides, i need to write a compo of characterisation all about him! so i should really get to know him better. i would then be killing two birds with one stone.   Yongjie unable to make it = no motivation = zilch productivity!!   * Tsk!!  at least if someone goes, i'll be able to force mahself to do something.
