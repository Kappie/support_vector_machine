I'm blogging this at a cafe since i'm still here in Butuan waiting for my next class later at 1:30, what a bummer. This Saturday though, i'll be busy in the morning coz i have classes, then in the afternoon, i have a meeting with the lectors...then in the evening, we'll be having a blast once again...Tequila na sad!!!  Ate, if you're reading this, just pray na lang. I have already talked to Maam Ruffa, and everything will turn out ok in the end, just don't lose hope. You take care there and send my regards to Papa.
