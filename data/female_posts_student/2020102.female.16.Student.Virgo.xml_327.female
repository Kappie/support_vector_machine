Blake: You should make a music video and film you guys playing in church and then when you're in the recording studio, and then you could cut to scenes of you walking along the beach... Alex: Where? At Chatfield?  "Hi, my name is Erin, and... my favorite color is clear..." -Ryan after Erin said something really stupid  Sarah: (talking to Erin) Gee thanks for telling us that, Erin! What would we do without you? Ryan: Live normal lives.  "You're going out to lunch? Ohhhh. EEEEHHH! Try writing that noise. Why does that noise hurt you? I want to know about your personal life, Ryan. Oh my gosh he's smiling LOOK! Oh my gosh. How many times are you going to fall for it. I'm fixing it. I fixed it. What? What? Oh my gosh I hate you! That's the worst thing you could have said! I hope you die. I'm not going anywhere with you tomorrow! I hope the guy you really love calls you because I know you love that HEARTWRENCHING FEELING! I know you are but what am I? I know you are but what am I. (fake cries) I really don't want him to call! That's like wishing your eyes would fall out of your head." -the latest Erin rant  (talking about nicknames and how people rhyme names) Sara Cole: Everyone calls me "Sara Bara". Austin: Yeah, everyone calls me "Austin Boston". (moment of silence and confusion) Sara: Oh I get it, Boston is a real word, not just nonsense that you made up.  Boston is a state! Austin: (laughs really hard) (sorry, "emense" is not a word) Sara: What is so funny? Austin: You mean city, not state.
