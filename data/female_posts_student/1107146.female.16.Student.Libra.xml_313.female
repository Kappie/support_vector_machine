You know I'm so sick of feeling guilty over what I did and then having you go on about how cruel it was doesn't help. Either we forget the past and move on to be friends or we can keep on fighting and not be friends and driving everyone crazy. so I vote that we be friends if at all possible. I promise never to think of what happened if you do, don't even mention it. love yall rosie
