Just when I start not caring about what will happen and thinking that everything will be all right that way, everything to force me to worry again happens.   So far, in 24 hours, my cat's bladder nearly broke, my washing machine broke, my toe nearly broke, my computer's half crapped even though it's pretty new, and I've yet to start studying.   Moo.
