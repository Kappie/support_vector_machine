       
      Starry, starry night  Paint your palette blue and gray  Look out on a summer's day  With eyes that know the darkness in my soul  Shadows on the hills  Sketch the trees and the daffodils  Catch the breeze and the winter chills  In colors on the snowy linen land    no one is talking to me. the people who think they understand are silent, the people who know they don't understand are worse. people who just don't know talk too much, a mixed blessing. i scorn them for petty problems, but praise them for distracting my from the soap opera that is my life. people tell me to stop using lyrics, to say it my own way, but what if i'm tired of hearing myself talk? anyway, i'm going to go see the third lord of the rings tonight, and i'm going to have a wonderful time, and then i'm going to come home and it will all start over again. i wish something bad had happened in my life, a terrible home growing up, an abusive boyfriend,  something . but no, there is nothing in my life to blame for this depression. there's only one constant, and one thing to blame. Myself.
