I feel like I have no friends and like everyone has forgotten me.  No one calls me.  No one!  If I don't call them then I don't hear from them.  This is the first year that no one even called me to do anything New Years Eve.  I just stayed home on my couch watching the re-run of the Canadian Idol Finale.  Everyone else went out, while I just stayed home and was lonely and bored out of my mind.  Then I called up Chels today.  Usually me and her can have 2 hour conversations no problem and like just talk and talk.  When I called her today it seemed like the last thing she wanted to do was talk to me.  All she said within the time span of five minutes was: "Yeah, uh-huh, maybe, and oh."  I was kind of like having a one-way conversation.  I KNOW for a fact that if it had been Monet that called she would have not been so boring and unenthusiastic on the phone.  I did offer to her that we could go to a movie today or something but I never foreced the decision on her, all I said was "call me later then if you want to do something."  For some reason though I know that she isn't going to call.  I don't think she wants to do anything with me right now.  No one seems to ever want to do anything with me, but why?  What have I ever said or done that was so wrong?  What was it that I did?  After that conversation I just cried because we aren't the kind of friends we used to be.  Ever since she met that new girl Monet this year she has been way different.  I mean I have nothing against Monet and she is very nice, but all the stuff Chels and I used to do together is the stuff that Monet and her do together now.  I always hear about "When Monet and I went to the mall" or "When we went to so-and-so concert."  No one invited me to the mall....and no one ever invited me to the concerts they have been to.  Chels used to be the ONLY person that I could talk to about anything, and it hurts me so much now.  There are so many things I want to talk about, so many problems that I want to discuss with someone but I feel alone right now and there is just no one to talk to about anything anymore.  It hurts alot.  It never occured to me that someday our friendship wouldn't be as strong as it once was, and I never thought that she would meet someone that has better qualities in a friend that she would like better then me.  It makes me wonder sometimes 'Where did I go wrong?  What did I say to make you feel this way'?  I wonder why no one ever calls me.  I didn't do anything to hurt them or upset them, it's certainly not something I did or said.  I feel like I have no friends right now.  At lease no close friends at the moment.  As I get older the people I once were close with just somehow don't seem as close anymore.  I know this is a common feeling for a lot of people, but I don't want to loose all my so-called friends that I once had.  I can't do that you know, I can't do life alone right now.  I need people here for me more than ever.  I don't know what I would do without anyone else.  What I am trying to say is that basically I just feel very ALONE and FORGOTTEN and I need someone in my life right now that cares just a little.  That's all.
