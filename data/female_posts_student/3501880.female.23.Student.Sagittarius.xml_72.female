And while I feel relief, I also feel as if I have gone through what it feels like to squeeze a 10 lb. baby out of something the size of a lemon (metaphorically, of course) for about the last week or so. As a result, I am feeling a little blue.   There is always this period after finals where I don't quite know what to do with myself. I feel a bit empty and a bit lost and a bit unsure of what to do with myself. I feel a bit like Marie Osmond after having her 20th child, I guess.  This never last more than an evening at the most, cause then I realize that I have a ton of things that I would much rather do than school and felt guilty when I did do them during the semester.   But for the moment, this brief moment, I feel the emptiness that follows when you produce something, and let it out into the world, and just hope and pray that you didn't fuck it up too badly.
