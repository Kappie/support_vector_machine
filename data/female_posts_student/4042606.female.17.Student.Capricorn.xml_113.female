Why doesn't he just get one of his whores to join the website, and not my sister. I know exactally what is going to happen and he is just going to end up hurting her. Abby may have known Ian longer than I did, but, I still know more about him. Abby is just being stupid when she says she wants to hang out with Ian again. I would have posted this earlier, but, somehow Abby got Ian's phone number and hasn't gotten off the phone since 4 in the afternoon. I want Abby to stop calling Ian, and I want Michelle to butt out of everything, she has no right talking about us when she is way out in Ohio, and has no idea about what is really going on.
