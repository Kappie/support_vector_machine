I fell in love with it the minute I tried it on. Sure, I probably should have gotten something a little more colorful, but black goes with everything so it doesn't matter what color Mark wears. Besides, black is slimming and god knows I need to slimmed. Hahaha.   Ho hum. I'm such a lucky girl. Why do I need other people to tell me this before I can realize it for myself? I think I'm crazy.
