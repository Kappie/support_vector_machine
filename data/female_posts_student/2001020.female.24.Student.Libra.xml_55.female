It's not that it's not a strong feeling, because it is, but it's a very guarded feeling. I feel like giving into it may be very bad, and that's why I hold back. But how bad could it be? How wrong is a feeling, even though you know you shouldn't have it? He's Jewish, I'm Arab, it can't and won't work, and it's going to go nowhere. So I ask myself, should I fall in love? Is he in love? Does it matter? Does the fact that this does not compare to the others prohibit me from being in love? Will he fall in love with me? Has he? Is he? It's been 5 months today...it seems quite normal for me to be in love way before this. So, what is holding me back? Is it right? Should I jump? Or should I just walk slowly back down the ladder?
