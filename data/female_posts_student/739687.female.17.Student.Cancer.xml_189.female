I didn't think so..."  "...then you bring me home  cuz we both know what it's like to be alone  and i'm dreaming in your living room  but we don't have much room to live..."   Well, today was again rather typical. But aren't they all. I'm really looking for something different in my life, and I'm just getting the same repetition. And I'm hating it. However, some good memories from the past are catching up with me, and I really enjoy that. Just getting that feeling again...it's nice. But I'm looking for more...I'm always looking for more.  Well, computer is lagging so bad and I'm gonna go kill it now. Later crazies.
