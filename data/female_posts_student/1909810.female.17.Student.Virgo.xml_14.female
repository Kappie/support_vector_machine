It was an extremely nice day outside today but sadly I didn't do much to fill up my time, I hung up our hammock between our two trees in our backyard and read my book which was nice, and then of course I fell asleep.  Rehearsals start tomorrow, I have a feeling this will all feel like a waste of my time, but I should make the best of it and stop my complaining seeing that it's not much to complain about.  I wish I could get over my excessive shyness, it's not just with people I've recently met..it's with  everyone  and it can be quite bothersome, especially when there's something I want to say but that I can never get myself to say and then I'm stuck pondering about things alone rather than talking to a friend. Hey...that was one long sentence. uh.  When I was younger I was never shy, up through the 6th grade I think.  During that time I talked a little too much, probably to a point where people wanted to slap me across the face and tell me to shut the fuck up. And then middle school happened, it stripped me of my sanity and here I am today stuck with myself and no one to talk to. Well...there are  some  people to talk to, but of course I limit myself and my words so as not to say too much..because being shy can do that to you...
