So does Maria.  Maria i love you so much.  Seriously.  You rock so hard.  So does your brother's band.  Too bad there's a ringing in my left ear now lmao.  I haven't decided if Friday's game has pulled us together as a team, or pushed us further apart.  Honestly I don't care that much, I just wish people would stop getting hurt (mentally physically etc)  Today I went nuts and kicked a hole in our kitchen wall.  Long story, basically my dad is an ass and made me shovel ALL of the dog crap in our front yard because he got pissed when he stepped in some.  We have FOUR dogs.  I almost puked.  What a jerk.  Then I came in and he made me move all these paint cans into the basement and I was just tired of doing crap for him.  So he went out into the garage and I got mad and kicked the wall.  REALLY hard apparently.  A little bit harder than I kicked Matt's shin, now there's a hole the size of my fist in the kitchen wall.  I guess Matt's shin musta hurt a bit. :)  Also basketball was terrible.   4 suicides 20 laps around the gym 16 sprints (8 with balls overhead) not to mention  stupid ass defensive positioning drills  the employment of BUBBA in our outlet-layup drill five-man from hell 2 minute layup drill...olympic... the whole nine yards. all in an hour and a half  why do i suck at life?  and why DONT hate Jeremy?   good question.  :)  Hating people is fun until you realize there is nothing to look forward to anymore
