Usually, I really enjoy being back in my own space, getting back to its natural sparkle and charm.  But this time, I just missed the break and the folks I spent it with.  Thank god for morning pages, I tell you what!  Had too damn much to get done today to be doing it in a mood!  So yea, as each line of the three pages filled, the little black cloud above my angelic head dissipated, leaving nothing but a bright, sunny ball of sunshine in its wake.    And I've been really productive to boot.  Completed two loads of laundry, cleaned my apartment, hung the new wall decorations (which kick serious ass, thanks to that fabulous man of mine), had my chipped windshield (that wasn't really chipped, had a bug baked on...oops!) to the windshield doctor and chatted with a favorite journalism professor.  Yay.  And it's only five!  Think I'll put the trip to campus off until tomorrow.  Get to buy a $100 book and see about health insurance.  Damn turning 23 anyway!    The sulkiness of the morning reminded me of this day last year.  (Come on, you knew it wasn't going to end that quietly, didn't you?)  This was the day of my big departure/inevitable return, and there's only one way to commemorate it properly.     Sunday, January 12    We all awoke on time.  There was no time for laziness today; we needed to get to the train station by 10, although if something prevented us from reaching it in time, it wouldn't have broken my heart.  Each stop on the Tube lasted an eternity, bringing me closer to the last place I wanted to go, but also not going quickly enough.  The frantic pace of life was returning, and I fought to hold onto the patient, relaxed lesson I learned in the city streets.   I have to remember how to do this when I get home   The process of saying goodbye was made all the more difficult because the three of us had, by the end of my stay, formed a cohesive union.  At dinner the night before, Grant and I finally looked into each other's eyes and laughed the laugh of friends, a slice of understanding sliding into place.  It had been decided that I would make the journey to the airport by myself, so this station was to be the site of our farewell.     I love the sound of his footsteps behind me, listening to their sighs and laughter.   "Have a safe trip back and a safe drive back to school.  Let me know you get there okay," he said to my hair as we hugged.  "I will."  It was the last thing I wanted to think about at the moment.  "I'm glad I got to meet you Grant, and I can't wait 'til next time."  "You too.  The train's getting ready to leave, get your ass on!"  And he shoved me aboard.  Then we waited.  I took a seat next to the platform so we could make faces and over-dramatic gestures to each other, laughing so as not to cry.     I smell the white room, and can feel him tapping my back in time with the music.  Wonder if I'll still be able to smell this city on my scarf in a month.   They ran with the train as it pulled away, creating entertainment for my fellow passengers and a perfect memory for me.   Grant was right--Coke does taste better over here.   Yay.  You can all celebrate now; no more London essay.  But it'll always be part of you now, don't even try to fight it.
