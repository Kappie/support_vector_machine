[New]  New Song #2  Where Are You Going  Help Myself  New Song #3  Everyday   __________________   What Would You Say  Rapunzel      Words, words, words, can't even EXPLAIN WHY this band would play 15 of the same songs they played Friday night in Tinley Park.  All day Sunday I was feeling like just getting into my car and driving down to Indy, but I'm damn glad I stayed home and spent the rest of the day with my dad.  Could you imagine hearing almost every song again?  I can't even begin to understand why they are doing this.  I've read things that people post on Nancies about DMB playing the same songs, but 15 out of 19 is just wrong.  Especially since almost every other song they played Friday and Saturday, came off of Everyday.  What gives?  Not for me to answer.  Just that I'd hate to be that guy who went to the Maryland Heights Show, the Tweeter Show and both nights of Deer Creek(verizon wireless) in Indianapolis.  Hope he had tons of money for liquor to take away the pain.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE DMB, but not changing it up a little, when you have a TON of awesome songs, is quite disappointing.  Now I am even more excited to see the set list from the Monday night show-tonight's show-they betta Rock The House!  Speaking of Rocking The House, I've decided that Dave should show up here, with the band, and play in my back yard.  I wouldn't be greedy, I would tell my close friends and family and it would be a nice little gathering.  Then I would proceed to suggest the set list for the first night, because Dave would be spending the night, and it would be like this...  One Sweet World Granny Warehouse *sigh* Grace Is Gone Grey Street *sigh* Dancing Nancies The Dreaming Tree Halloween *sigh*(i don't care how shot his voice is) Ants Say Goodbye Gold To Me (cover) Tangerine (cover) Don't Drink The Water (for sokie) Bartender Pay For What You Get The Maker  Encore with Crush and Too Much OR Crash Into Me and The Song That Jane Likes OR a long version of Seek Up and Two Step.  Then on the second night they can just give me stuff like WWYS, and Lover Lay Down, and Satellite....  My natural high would last into the night and definitely the next 10 YEARS!  I want my ring tone to be customized by Stefan with a special intro to Crush. Damn that boy!    Fathers Day. My dad was in Chicago this weekend for a bachelor party.  Going to a Cubs game for your bachelor party, then spending the rest of the night going from bar to bar in downtown Chicago.  What a deal!!!  That would be my ideal bachelorette party, add some smokin' hotties and it would be complete.  {aka cowboys!}  Anyway, my dad showed up at my grandma's in the afternoon and we spent the rest of the day together.  Ate way too much meat.  Pork roast and then later I had BBQ.  My mom made the best pork roast and potatoes and carrots.  Mmmmmm.  I wish I could have some now.  My brother and his family were there also, but then my brother had to leave and go to work.  It's always good seeing my brother twice in three days.  I think I'm going to see him again this weekend.    Thinking about going up to Wisconsin to see Phish on Friday night, then coming home early Saturday morning for a garage sale, lunch with Superfly for her birthday and then onto my cousins going away party.  Sunday will be her going away party for the family.  Oops, I've said too much about my personal life.  Talk about personal, I think the next time I get laid, I will post about it.  Hell, I might even make something up.  I really need to start writing steamy sex stories.  But I wouldn't want people to think I was that kind of girl.  Ha Ha.  My stories would start all romantic and end with so much kink, even I would have to stop and head straight to bed. "This girl is getting laid, and masturbates more than I do"  eh?  I agree.  If I was getting some, I would only get myself off for entertainment purposes only.  Oh my.  I will get to work on something soon and link a page to it.  Right now I have to burn a cd and download the new songs from this tour.  Holla.   Peace. Love. DMB.
