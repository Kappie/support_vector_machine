Everything seems to be pretty exciting for me because I do want to know, I want a path,  I mean destiny is mine and I can do what ever I want and how ever I want to my life because I control it. But all I needed was someone to guide me there and tell me that I am doing the right thing.   Monk Saran was very nice and very kind. He didn't make a big deal even if I didn't know how to speak proper Cambodian nor do I know how to speak monk. It was pretty hard for me but I managed it. He told me that my future looks great. I don't have to worry about it and that he doesn't have to say much. I'll be very successful within the next two to three years. Just have to keep in mind set on my goals and stay focus on what I really want to do and stay strong. This is business wise.   As for my love life... He told me that there is no one out there who can control me because I'm the wild one. I'm always the one that's always messing around with everything and everyone. The one that I'm planning on the start a family with is rite next to me and that I don't have to look for him anymore. This guy is the one I'll choose to be my soulmate and I will always be the boss to this person. I'll always be the lead which is good. I just have to be nice to this person and not talk so much shit. He said that I'm a shit talker and that I need to stop doing that if I want things to work out. I also need to stop pushing and stop avoiding him and start looking at the right direction.  The in-laws... my family and his family wont get along because his family is very strike and very tradition. We're looking at two different class rite now. One will look very low at the other. But all of this doesn't matter as long as this future guy can manage to maintain working things out with me we'll do just fine. The monk also told me that I am the type of person who doesn't like anyone looking down at me under any circumstances. I will work my way up to the very top and they'll respect me and see me as a somebody. But then again the love will by past everything.  Alyssia... she'll do just fine... I'll be very proud of this girl. She'll be very smart and very successful. She'll have a better life then her mommy will.   Having more kids.. one or two more if I desire.   He had said so much more but I'll cut it down short. I don't have to worry about my life, I'll do just find. Now, I'm just very excited, I'm gonna go for whats been plan for. I'm going for it and this time no turning back. I need to hold on and look straight towards my target. I'm happy that this is something very positive that I want to know..
