OK so I got a 60 something on my math quiz 10.5/16 but well I know it is not the end of the world and well it was just because I didn't understand the last question.  My math teacher was also being really nice today and she was so right.  Ya know she was telling me about how I am a really really great student and if I just had the confidence then I could do so much more.  She is right.  But well it is kind of the same for Chem but I am REALLY REALLY trying and well I think my average right now might be like a 56% and anyone who knows me knows that is NOT like me at all.  I am TRYING so HARD, but I really don't understand however I understand more than I did than when I began.  I am worried about the quiz for Chem thurs cause I am having diffuculty and the science wing is all closed tommorow cause it is Wednesday tommorow so I am not sure when I will get the help I need.  Anyways I don't know what to do about Chem cause well I could drop it and make life easier but I NEED chem for University like the courses I want to do, but well even if I do pass I don't think they are gonna want someone with like a 56 some average in there.  I am SOOO CONFUSED and I WISH I KNEW just what I do.  Well after I write a poem about how I feel right now I need to go practice my math for tommorows test.     Wondering Why?      Forever, it seems  One more breath, one more time  Wondering why, oh why, oh why  Is this happening?   Why Chem, why me, why now  Why  Why   Why    Why     Why?!  I sit here and think and wish  Things will get better   I must pass chem  Dig my way through this tunnel  Find the exit  Looking for it, forever   Wandering round,  Finding that escape somewhere  somehow  Out in darkness   Tears unending  Searching  Wishing for not much,  Someone to hug, someone to hold   A person so special  Not too young, never too old  With power so strong  To heal this heart   Passing on days  Like they mean so much  Why are things so hard  Why must this be happening?   And In the end  I still do not know  Will I be happy?  Where will I go?   How will I get there?  What job will I do?  Will I pass my classes?  If only I knew   Forever, it seems  One more breath, one more time  Wondering why, oh why, oh why  Is this happening?   ~Vanessa
