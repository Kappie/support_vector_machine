Very wary. 2]  Always abandon the shitty job for the new job that kicks ass. 3]  Always work your ass off during quarter breaks.  Your bank account will appreciate it. 4]  Do not, under any circumstances, take 4 classes at one time.  For the sake of your sanity.   5]  You can not fit someone over 6 foot tall in your small Toyota Echo.  It doesn't work [sorry Jon]. 6]  Your small Toyota Echo is NOT a big badass red snow plow.  Well, thats about it.  Anything important that you learned this past year?  Feel free to share with me at  urlLink this E-mail addy .
