I'm sure I've written about this before,or maybe I just thought about it, but I had a nice dream last night that seemed quite realistic at the time.  The night before I had a horrible dream.  My house was my house, but it looked a little different, older, and Flagstaff was quite humid.  We had orange trees in our backyard and little ledges that hung over bedroom windows.  Well the orange trees were infested with bugs, well everything was really, slimy ones, and under each ledge over the windows were black birds with extremely scary eyes and there was shit all over the piece of wood they were perched on.  The bugs really freaked me out, they were all over my bedroom, and finally a big slimy spider thing was on my face and I couldn't get it off and I woke up to realize the plastic band of my headphones had slid down over my face and the wire was wrapped around my head, I had fallen asleep listening to music.  Speaking of music, Ani's CD is almost here.  Yay, I'm going right after school on tuesday to get it.  Eh, that reminds me.  We have finals this coming week.  Shit.  I freak out before finals, along with most everyone, but it's really not a good feeling knowing that your grade depends on ONE shitty test.  I'll be studying most of tomorrow and monday, yay, exciting.   I guess I'll be suffering through french for another semester.  When your choice is taking a 3rd english or staying in french, and the thought that the colleges you want to attend won't accept you if you only have 2.5 credits of a foreign language is pounded into your head, you're kind of just forced into it.  That was a long sentence...hmm.  I shouldn't complain though.  In peace last tuesday I became quite annoyed.  A girl began expressing a peev of hers, she didn't like that some people complained about stupid things.  Some examples: when people complain of having to mop with dirty water, well some people don't have a floor to mop.  People complaining about school, some people can't go to school.  Things like that, it all crosses our minds at at least one point in our lives.  Two seconds later this girl starts complaining about having to get a petition signed so she could get credit for her classes because of the number of absences she had, well...some people can't go to school.  I donno, she just...she never shuts up, and she gets annoyed when people don't concentrate completely on her when she's talking and when others talk she pays no attention what so ever.  I have no reason to be writing this...I guess I have nothing better to say.  It's a saturday night and I'm sitting at my house staring at  a computer screen.  How lovely.
