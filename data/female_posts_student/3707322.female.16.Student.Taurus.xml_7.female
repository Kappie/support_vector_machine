And I'm not going to lie, David was definitely one of those people that I realized a lot about my relationship with. Most importantly, that it was a very good idea to get out of that relationship. Looking back, I realized that he did nothing. Sure, he was a good guy, but he never took the initiative to call me or set up a time to hang out or anything. That was all me. I would clear my schedule thinking that we were going to hang out, but then something would come up for him and I would be left hanging. How does that make me feel about myself? How does that make me feel about what I mean to him? Obviously if he can just blow me off at the last minute I'm not important. And as his  girlfriend  I really should be important. At least important enough to call or make some sort of effort to be with. Also, I realized that there are much better guys out there, and I don't need to settle for a Freshman who I'm only minorly attracted to just because he is into me. In fact, I'm totally done with younger guys. I know that sounds very harsh, but I don't care. I'm ranting, I'm allowed to be harsh. If you have a problem with that, then you are just going to have to deal.  I also realized things about my political views. For one, I'm not a conservative. I'm just more conservative than some people in my high school. But in the scheme of things, I'm a liberal. I guess I just hadn't really thought about it for a while, and since then my views have changed. I thought a lot about God and my relationship to Him and what He means to me etc. I'm still sorting out my beliefs, but it helps me to believe that I do have a purpose and that He is all around us, in nature etc. I prayed every night for the protection of my group and all my friends back home and for guidance through this confusing time in my life. But I still don't know. A guy on my trip made some good points about the absence of God in real life which made me think even more. But God is what you make of Him, and I still don't know what He means to me. For now I'm content to just not know and keep thinking and sorting it out.  The most important thing I realized is why I am so self-destructive. I don't know how it started, maybe from being the oldest and therefore the natural provider of eight kids from a young age. Well, not provider so much as protector. I took care of those kids, even when I was very young. When someone got hurt, they went to me and either I took care of them or I brought them to their parents. When there was a fight, I sorted it out. When they were bored, I came up with a game to play. I had to grow up fast, and I did. I had to take care of them, and put them over myself and what I wanted to do. I guess I just got used to it. That transitioned over into my life at school and with my friends of my own age. I felt like I had to take care of everyone, just because I always had. Everyone gotused to it too. And they started to take advantage of it and take the fact that I took care of them for granted. So then whenI realized that I was unhappy, I couldn't stop. So I turned to other methods of getting rid of my pain and frustration, because I was unable to show it in public. I tried to change, but ended up as a social outcast. The fact that I was a really awkward kid didn't help with that either. Since I grew up so fast, I didn't fit in with my peers. I still really don't, but I'm getting closer. So I re-invented myself again to fit in, and it worked suprisingly well. I had friends and a boyfriend and everything. But I was playing a part, and I was still getting stepped on. I couldn't go on like that, and ended up having a serious breakdown. From then on I swore to myself that I would always be myself, even if no one accepted me for it. Besides, I had become used to not having anyone around, to being completely self-reliant emotionally. It's very hard to be alone though. Everyone needs to feel loved on some level, everyone needs to be reliant on someone. I've come to this realization recently. That it isn't healthy to be alone.It also isn't healthy not to take some time and so things for yourself.And yet I still continue to put others ahead of myself, and get stepped on. Addison is right, I need to raise my bitch level. Otherwise I will continue to be stepped on my entire life, and continue to be miserable. Jed was right when he said that I have a lot of hope and I am a generally positive person. I do have a lot of hope. I have hope for the world and for other people, I just have no hope for myself. Before my trip I had pretty much resigned myself to being miserable and stepped on (my relationship with David is evidence of that). But after meeting all these amazing people and experiencing all these things, I can say that I want to change that. I don't want to be stepped on for the rest of my life. At this rate, I will be dead before I'm thirty, most likely by my own hand. I just need to believe in myself and that I have more to offer the world than my services and my pain. I'm an artist, an actor,a musician, an athlete, and an interesting, intelligentperson. I just need some self-confidence, which I'm gaining. And it would be a lie to say that my trip didn't provide me with a lot of it. Especially the people. Everyone was so supportive, and they all liked me for me and thought that I was talented and told me so. That definitely helps with one's self-confidence. Also, they were all amazing and talented people that I respect, which only adds to the merit of their opinions in my mind. Doing challenging things, such as climbing the Grand Teton (summit:13,700ft above sea level) and backpacking60 miles in nine days, 25 of them while dehydrated, gives me confidence in my abilities. Both mental and physical. It took all I had to just keep walking while I was dehydrated. I was really out of it, and I had to concentrate very hard just to put one foot in from of the other and not puke all over the trail. Climbing the Grand was also mentally challenging. Getting up at 3am is tough anyway, but climbing and hiking at 4 is very hard, especially at elevation. Well, it was for me anyway. But I hyperventilatied and kept going, and sumitted with the rest of my group. Some of my personal relationships with people on the trip also attributed to my newfound self-respect, but for their privacy and mine, I won't delve into that.  So basically, I'm well on the road to discovering myself and who I really am. I was completely lost on the road of life, and I got a few vague directions. It might not be much, but it's better than nothing. It's like someone gave me a riddle to figure out, but it's written in code and I have just decoded part of it. I don't know the answer, I don't even know the whole riddle, but I know more than I did. And for this juncture in my life, I'd say that is pretty damn good.
