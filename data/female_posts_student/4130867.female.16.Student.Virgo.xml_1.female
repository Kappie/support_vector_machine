Recently, I met someone. ooh ok... not just someone. it's a guy. well its not a big deal actually, only that after all these time of not having dramas in my life made me feel as though it has been such a long time since i met someone new! but its not like im head over heels with him. maybe the emptiness inside  me is taking much more control of me than my feelings do! maybe... Anyway, his name is W*** and he's 25. hes not really a very nice guy, at least not the good type. he's kinda bad and he likes me becos im bad too. haha~ But then again, I will never love him. i wouldnt mind having fun though. just no strings attach. i know how agony love can be and i dont wanna be someone's toy.Giving in to sweet words and great actors. ooooh, im just aint that stupid anymore.i dont wanna waste my tears and my feelings any longer. i like someone's companion and i really wouldnt mind using him a lil. wicked me~
