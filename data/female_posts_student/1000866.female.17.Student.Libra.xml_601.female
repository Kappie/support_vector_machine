I think I'm glad i didn't see those last 20 minutes with Brandon and Peter. I would've made a fool of myself crying. Heh. It was great though. Even better than the first time actually. I really, really enjoyed it.   Tomorrow, I definitely need to do some homework. I should probably start working on my psych project and I definitely need to work on my paper for W.E.W. and get that done with.   Oh, today at the mall. I went to Hollister and got a sweater for $6, good deal. :) I also got a pair of pants and a shirt from gap for like...$20. Not bad either considering it's Gap.   Heh heh, good old Martha....ah, that was amazing. Four counts...alll guilty. :) Wow, that's really mean of me isn't it? I shouldn't be reveling in her pain but I really am getting immense satisfaction out of this.  Anyway, I need to go sleep or something because I am absolutely exhausted. So long, farewell...
