I didn't felt anything but a deep cold fear that froze all my body and mind. I felt so insignificant, so weak, so lost. I still soak in pain when I hark back. This wound is deep, too real, too hard to heal… I'm paralyzed, suffering in silence, my broken dream. Everyday I putt a mask and move on…  Though my injured soul till bleeds the tears of sorrow And this will be until the end
