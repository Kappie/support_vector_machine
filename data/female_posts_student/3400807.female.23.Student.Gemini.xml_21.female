This will be a temporary post!!! It's getting yanked down in... a week. I guess. I haven't decided quite how long yet... Ok, so most of you know that I came from   urlLink  here    first. I've just posted   urlLink  this entry   , which, I believe is pretty self-explanatory. Yes,   urlLink  Kyra   , I've already planned to include the   urlLink  Achilles' Choice    post. And I will   urlLink  probably      urlLink  post      urlLink  the      urlLink  whole      urlLink  what      urlLink  really      urlLink  happened      urlLink  series   . Other than that, I haven't decided. I didn't realize just how much I had posted there... Anyway, the point is, I'm taking votes. Either   urlLink  leave comments    (they do accept html) or   urlLink  email me    with anything you found interesting or worthy of inclusion at the   urlLink  Blogger site   .  (And  that , I think, is quite enough in the way of links for one post!)
