A couple of days beforehand I got a letter from Longacres confirming their job offer (so I duly accepted) so I'm finally not quite so skint (or I won't be when I get paid next Thursday).  Friday I went shopping in Guildford, picking up some fecking great bargains.  Mainly clothes, which I'd be getting as presents the next day.  Speaking of which, Saturday was my 17th!!  Absolutely fantabulous.  Gran, Papa, Phil, Mike, Maria and Alana came round for tea and cake, and I got my clothes (pretty purple dress, black bustier, silver corsetty-type jobby, purple 3/4 sleeve top and a black skirt, I think it's called a drindle or something), also a case for my camera, beaded curtain, and great big fluffy cushion and some fluffy heart lights.    This is Alana and JP on the aforementioned cushion.  Bless!!  Then an hour or so later my friends started to arrive for the big party.  Julie and Stew turned up first, literally as I'd just pulled my dress on.   Julie and Stew (well, Julie's arse at least, but it's a nice one!)  Theeen it was Colin, Paul and Jamie, followed shortly by Chaz, so we could get started!  This was taken before we got pissed, indicated by the fact there aren't CD's strewn all over the place.  However, Julie does appear to be stroking Jamie's foot in a strange fashion, but that's just her.  Speaking of Julie, she gave me a very nice willie keyring, which I would put pictures of up if they weren't a little on the rude side.  Anyway, here's me in my purple dress:    The flushed face, exposed cleavage and inability to balance can be put down to the bottle in my hand.  More drinking led to this:    Yep, that's me in the background, my tit covered only by a large, cunningly placed red cross.  I haven't yet mentioned my lovely balloons, mainly because I neglected to take a picture before all the helium was inhaled (leading to hilarious renditions of "Follow the Yellow Brick Road"), but you can see them in the background of this picture of Paul and Chaz:    She'll probably kill me for putting such an unflattering picture of her on here, but... oh well.  Most of the events of that evening are a bit of a blur, but highlights included me burning the pizza because I was too out of it to remember how to work the oven, Jamie conducting a loud phone conversation outside my parents' bedroom door about what nymphomaniacs me and Colin are, the traffic cone from my back garden mysteriously appearing in the middle of the floor, me and Colin declaring our undying love for each other (we didn't even need to be drunk, bless), Julie stumbling round at 4 in the morning trying to find her glasses (and waking us up!) and the zip for my dress being broken.    Shit photo, but it gives an interesting clue as to how my zip went.  Anyway, we eventually all fell into a drunken stupor and awoke early the next morning to find... SNOW!!  Some of us didn't much fancy getting up...    Buuuut eventually childish excitement took over and here's the pics:   Colin, Julie (well, part of her), Paul and Jamie.    Awww, Colin!  I'm having this as my wallpaper when I get my new PC.    Me, ever the poser, looking very fetching in mum's coat    Cheer up, it's snowing!!  Foolish chaps with no coats, eh?    Yay, happy dance!!    And that's it for birthdayness, I think.  I spent Sunday hung over, Monday I went to pick up my new crash (17" Sabian AAX Dark Crash, yum) from Drumwright and buy stands for the ride and china Jamie's planning to sell me, then put up the feathery curtain I got from Paul and Chaz and the fluffy heart lights.  Tuesday... oh yeah, I tidied up a bit and Colin came round.  I also gave my beddy bear (it's a lavender-scented bear you warm in the microwave, pressie from Col) a test run, slept like a log!  Yesterday I started work, all very thrilling, although I did turn up half an hour early due to dad's nerves.  Disappointingly I didn't go today, but went to the doctors about this blasted cold I've had for weeks, then snuggled up in bed again. So, that's the thrills and spills of birthday week!
