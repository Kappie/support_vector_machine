If I see someone with the same body frame, hair color, hair style, wearing clothes that he would wear, ANYTHING... it reminds me of him. I miss him a lot. Some days I'm fine, other days everyone I see has some feature that reminds me of him. I often wonder if it's my way of keeping him close to me... or if it's his way of letting me know that he's near me.
