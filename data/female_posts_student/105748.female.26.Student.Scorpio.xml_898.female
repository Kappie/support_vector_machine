A would be heir to royalty unbeknowns to Beauty,  he is soon feels the attraction to a horse.  This peturbed cartoon from Disney is unlike any they have turned out.  Lavish costumed horses and A Beast that is by far not even close to be lovable to any film buff.  Rated PG.  Had an accident driving to work this morning.  Snow on the roadway was not properly plowed from the surface and my tires slipped.  I hit a steel girter on the exit ramp of the NSP merging towards the LIE.  Some minor damage to my car -  right turn signal and a dent on the fender.  I am okay.  Dot commented that the worse luck occurs to me.  Lesson learned here - drive more carefully in inclement weather. Dot's birthday was yesterday and I greeted her the day before.  Doesnt that accout that I remembered and that I dont have to greet her again the next day?  I was in meetings and training all day thursday that by the time I got out of work she was fast asleep.  What do you guys think?  Its Friday... happy Friday! lets all  urlLink GET DOWN  on it...  NET
