Michael and Ali and this girl Ashley and her b/f Joe were my favorite people... they were mad nice to me and I had been talkin to Ali for a while online so it was AWESOME to meet her in person, same w/ Michael. They were all mad funny, they would come up to me in groups and ask me to say "wart-a" and then when I said it they would laugh. It was kinda funny how big a kick they got outta it but... oh well they were all really nice. Then Me and Mick stayed up till like, 3, and the next day we didn't wake up till 1. Saturday: As I said we didn't wake up till 1 so the whole-day-in-Indianapolis thing was kinda put on hold. So we didn't leave his house till around 5:00 and we started walking around at around 5:30. We walked around the canal and he showed me the Arts Garden and "The Circle". Then we went out to dinner and then we went home and stayed up all night and lets fastforward here.... Sunday: we didn't sleep so I just got mt stuff together and then I had a minor breakdown and then I met his family. That was an adventure. They were all really really nice. They like had the BEST accents but I deff had one to them so its all good. The Micks mom broke out the baby footage of Mick and the embarassment commenced. It was so funny... I couldn't contain myself. Then the moment came to say goodbye... there were a few good omens when we were going into the air port, like, were you ever on your way somewhere and like you see something that just tells you its all gonna be gravy? Well, we did, and it was good. But, then when I had to say goodbye. It was tearful but then he called me to tell me the plane was canceled and we got to hang out for a bit more.  I was really depressed when I was on the plane, it was such a relief to sleep and to not have to think about anything. Then we landed and it hit me the trip was really over and I might not see him again till June, maybe May. x0x
