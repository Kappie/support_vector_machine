Both really good movies. Hung out with Nicky a bunch, tis fun. Took Ayla to sewing Tuesday and Thursday, made a bundle. Nicky came with us on Tuesday, met up with Annetta on Thursday. Bought an outfit for Nick's dad's birthday party. tres sexy. Bought a foot pump for my air matteress. Took that to the lake on thursday with Ayla. It still works, which is tres awesome. Went to the lake again yesterday, just floated around on my air matteress,...nothing better than that. Went to Karissa's house later that day. Played Tom at pool and actaully WON for once. But only cause he messed up. Dan showed up too.....had to fight urges of violence towards him. Nick and Nana were there too. We bought a triple chill cake and ate it..gave new meaning to PCP party :D It was a lot of fun.  Nicky, Nana and Karissa went to youth last Friday. That was sweet. Hung out before that, got a boston cream pie (yum yum). Been trying to semi-organize the summer camp, and what the youth'll do there. It'll be rough....seeing as it's all me :P I've been trying hard to track down forms too for the damn thing...hopefully they'll show up soon.   Got a new bank card, to replace my stolen one. Hopefully my new care card will arrive soon. Annetta said she'd give me a wallet of hers that she despises, so score there. Nick invited me to go upisland with him and his family for 8 days, at Qualicum. Looks like it'll be a lot of fun. Apprently you can get sand dollars there, so I'll come home and be riiiiiiiich! Ahaha...ahem. 16 days til that, that'll be a lot of fun.   Going to some lake with Ayla today. We're bringing like, every float toy she and I own, and then gonig to raft them all together and go float around the lake in our completely ridiculous array. Too bad Nick's working out or whatever. It'd be fun if he could come too. Hopefully I'll burn nicely, so I can have a more fantastic tan. Be nice if my front and face browned up a bit too. I've given up hope on the legs tanning, but if they did, I wouldn't complain.  Anyways. I have to prepare making lists now. Lists for what I have to do before the camp, stuff I need before I go back to school, stuff I need before school, stuff I need upisland.....You know. Have a good one :)
