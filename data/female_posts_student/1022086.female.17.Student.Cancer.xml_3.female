For the first time in a very long time, I don't have any mandatory work for tomorrow. I will still get a few things done, but I can take my time! Not only that, but also I'm eating tostones (fried plaintains--- GOOD) while listening to an awesome, awesome song. (Damien Rice-- "Volcano").  Today was... well, it was not too gooded. I didn't feel good for most of the day at all. Mostly muscular pain. At one point at the beginning of calculus, I couldn't move and almost cried. Luckily, Kayla had some painkillers, and that helped me GREATLY, as I didn't have anything with me.   In Chemistry, we worked problems and bent glass. That was fun. I had done it priorly in first year Chemistry, but I had fun once again, and, like last year, I fused a piece of glass into a neat, twisted work of art. Once again like last year, I gave my creation to Coleman, afraid of getting in trouble with the school for having glass. *Rolls eyes* Sigh.  History was very boring, but I lived. I had fun doing some Watkins-bashing with Philip during lunch. I daresay that he almost hates her more than I hated her. Calculus was eh. I had a quiz and missed one of the multiple choice questions; I'm sure I did because I heard Mrs. Dunn explaining it to someone after class. I really hope that was the only one I missed, considering that there were only 10 questions on the quiz... On the bright side, I got my last quiz back, and I made a 100! This is miraculous because this is my first perfect quiz since the beginning of the semester. I missed the feeling of confidence a 100 brings.   Mrs. Bizarth had jury duty today; therefore, she wasn't in choir. We had a funny sub with an attitude, and that was midly entertaining. She was really nice to me, so that's all that mattered to me. Hehe. Well, anyway, Bizarth left one of those overly idiotic videos for us to watch and fill out worksheets about-- melody and rhythm. I would have appreciated videos regarding some more advanced theory instead... =-*    Anyway, Kim and I essentially talked all period and BS'd our way through the stupid assignment, as no part of it was valuable knowledge in any way-- not even trivial.   Had a pretty interesting nonsensical conversation with Sandra after school.   Came home. Am eating. W00t!!!    Okay. Yay. I'm in so much a better mood now that I'm home and can relax and do everything at my own time. Okay, I guess I'll go relax now. Maybe even play some Tekken Tag or something. Roo!   (Hmmm... this song would be great to skate to-- "Born Too Slow" by Crystal Method. I feel like skating now.)   "Volcano" by Damien Rice  Don't hold yourself like that You'll hurt your knees I kissed your mouth and back But that's all I need Don't build your world around volcanoes melt you down  What I am to you is not real What I am to you you do not need What I am to you is not what you mean to me You give me miles and miles of mountains And I'll ask for the sea  Don't throw yourself like that In front of me I kissed your mouth your back Is that all you need? Don't drag my love around volcanoes melt me down  What I am to you is not real What I am to you you do not need What I am to you is not what you mean to me You give me miles and miles of mountains And I'll ask for what I give to you Is just what i'm going through This is nothing new No no just another phase of finding what I really need Is what makes me bleed And like a new disease she's still too young to treat Volcanoes melt me down She's still too young I kissed your mouth You do not need me
