There's always the tricky ones that cause me to stop and think:  MC Solaar.  M or S?  Is MC a title or a name?    Dave Matthews Band: M or D?  If it were DMB, Inc., I'd know it would be D.  But it isn't.  that's all I can think of at the present time, but there are more.  Maybe later.  I'm doing laundry at my aunt's house.  Ordinarily, I'd feel funny doing that, but they've begged me to, and I'm poor, and running out of clean skivvies.    I just got an email from a friend with mention of Oingo Boingo.  I don't know if I mentioned them in a post, in an email, or what, but it was really funny because just last night when Iw as organizing my cd's I threw Only A Lad in my cd player to help me work, and was listening to the song that reminds me of Camazotz (I get enough nutrition by eating protein biscits recommended by the system)  Salt Lake City also reminds me of Camazotz.
