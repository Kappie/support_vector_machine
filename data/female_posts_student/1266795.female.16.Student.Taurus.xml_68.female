I'll expect everyone to be awaiting my arrival. :P All my faithful lil' companions...  Packing always gets me stressed. I'm one of those people who always worries that a pair of shoes or a particular item of clothing will be forgotten. De-stressing... Ha! Hey, if I made it through a sweltering KC Weekend in Ohio without sneakers or shorts, I should be able to survive ICON. :)  WISH JANICE LUCK! She's in the running for one of 14 International Board slots in the nation. GO JANICE! :P  That's enough for now. And by the way, Evan came over today to give me my birthday/Italy presents. I LOVE THEM ALL! They are soooooooo me! THANK YOU!!! (I doubt he'll read this, but if so, I hope he understands how much I appreciate his thoughtfulness.)  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"
