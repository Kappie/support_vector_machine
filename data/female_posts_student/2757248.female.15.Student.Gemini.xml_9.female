GOOD NEWS! I BROUGHT MY BAD GRADE UP TO A "B"!! YAYAY! god i dun care what else is on the prog. report im proud of that!!!!   12-14: MR.A let us off a mod early for lunch so me and Z went in the cafe. and i didnt have any money *TEARS* so i just ate her food.  and then rob, jess, and nate joined us and we played TELEPHONE! FUN!  15-17: English Lecture- worksheets, found out our grades.. i have a B!!  18-20: Algebra: we had a chapter test.. i think i did good. then gwen made a paper airplane and colored it really cute and tryed to fly it.. kinda hilarious if you ask me..   now im here.. eating cookies.. trying to find something on "how to build a catapult" then possibly lookin at colleges and looking more into psychology.. so yeah..
