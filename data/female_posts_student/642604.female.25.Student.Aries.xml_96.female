Visually beautiful, great story, amazing acting, I can't really even write anything about this because I am just so thrilled with it. Visually it is like American Beauty, which makes sense since it was directed by the same guy... just breathtaking... and oh my God I love Paul Newman.... just great.   Saturday day I fought with the cable guy.... he pissed me off and didn't fix the problem. That's two cable guys in four days....   Saturday night I went with Leigh and Amy to see the DC sessions. Not overly thrilled with the bands but I still had a good time. Sister Hazel played which was the highlight of the night. It started with Jackstar (I think that was the band's name) and they sucked. They were completely out of tune and the girl was either sharp or flat of the pitch the whole time... and their songs sucked. What mother told them they could sing??? Jesus. So then Ebo comes on, who is from Fairfax I guess. They're actually not all that bad, just not the kind of band I could listen to for hours on end. So then Sister Hazel comes on and they're not bad at all, in fact they have good sound, good tone, good harmony... only problem is I know a total of 2 of their songs and I am so hot and being pushed around by drunken crowd surfing crack smoking cheerleaders... no offense... so thank god, after we hear Sister Hazel's first radio hit from way back, you know the one that goes "Hard to say what it is I see in you, wonder if I'll always be with you..." Amy decides we can go.   Sunday day... fight with the cable company on the phone, work on English paper, write and watch Mike Meyers on television all day... that's about it....   :) [ Sun Jul 21, 11:18:22 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] DAVE in Hershey!!!   Leigh just called me from Hershey PA where he is, and I am so jealous here, at the DMB show right now... He called me twice, once during Two Step and once during Grey Street! I love this kid! My two favorites and he called so I could hear both! YAY!   "She feels like kickin' out all the windows and setting fire to this life... she could change everything about her..."   "Celebrate we will, cause life is short but sweet for certain, hey we climb on two by two, to make sure these days continue...." [ Sun Jul 21, 11:15:31 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Cheerleading???   So I had this dream last night that I went back to high school at my age now (23) for a fifth year... not quite sure why since in my dream I had graduated already the first time around just like before. And for whatever reason I joined the cheerleading squad. I don't remember much of the dream but I do remember that at one point after practice I went out to the parking lot and I couldn't find my car anywhere, I must've looked for hours. Aparently the high school parking lot was THAT big. So anyway, I am searching and searching and I finally remembered where I had parked. So I find the car. Then the next thing I know I am at practice and this girl and I are having an argument. Then the next thing I know I overhear someone telling this other girl that I am totally mean and that they don't want me on the team. And normally these are the kind of dreams where I get all upset and whatever but this time I just don't care. I'm like... they think I'm a bitch??? Whatever, fine with me. So I go to the coach and quit the team. The coach tries really hard to get me to stay but I say no thanks. Then I am on my way out to the car and even though it's the beginning of the year prom is like that weekend but I've decided not to go because I think that I've already been to enough proms in my first four years of high school and I don't really want to hang with a bunch of kids. I decide to just hang out with my friends at a party they are having that weekend. So as I am walking to my car to go home from the weekend this girl on the squad comes running up and hands me this invitation to the cheerleading after prom party she throws every year. I tell her I quit the team and she starts to cry saying it's all her fault and she's so sorry and she really wants me to stay. But I tell her it's for the best, I never really liked cheerleading all that much anyway. She says that I need to go to her party anyway, that she really wants me there. So as I am driving home I stop off at this dress store and just buy a gorgeous dress (cause aparently I am suddenly rich???). I think about who I can call and for whatever reason I decide that I will call my agent and just have him set me up with someone last minute... (I have an agent???). So I am there at my apartment getting ready and there is a knock on the door and when I open it my prom date is standing there... it's Joey Lawrence (why???)... I am utterly disappointed... I know the night is gonna suck and I am trying to get out of going. When we get to the prom I am all embarrassed because of my date and I think that everyone is gonna laugh but all these obnoxious teenage girls just go nuts over him and he is so happy... I realize that I need to just get out of high school all together right then because I don't want to be someplace that worships someone like Joey Lawrence.... so anyway we go in our limo to the girl's house who is having the party and just as we are ringing the doorbell I wake up....   It's totally weird, I don';t know where any of it came from and I am still baffled at the whole idea. But I wanted to write it all down because I always remember my dreams but they're not always as insane as this one. :)
