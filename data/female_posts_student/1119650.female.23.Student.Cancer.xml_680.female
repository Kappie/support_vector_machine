Its also good that the aforementioned girls weekend involved a lot of Sangria in pretty wine glasses (even if they're plastic), fresh baked cookies, card games, never have I ever and perhaps the filming of the most scandalous (non-pr0n) videotape EVER.  I don't think I've laughed so hard in ages.  Its nice to have girly friends who you're on the same page with.  Outlet shopping also helps this greatly.  Why am I addicted to  urlLink Pacific Sunwear >??  I also heard that the lovely Missy of RFBabies fame and Jeff of  urlLink Ron Fez.net  fame got engaged this weekend on the show.  Congrats to the two of you and best wishes for the happiest, healthiest, kitty  puppy filled life together!  You two deserve nothing but the best!  (c:  One week until my birthday, Happy Birthday today, to my cousin Melissa (not the previously mentioned Missy) and don't forget its  urlLink Anna's  birthday on Wednesday.  Get her somethin' nice!  Remember kids:  its fine at the time, but its a mess in the morning!
