Those Fins! What a place. I haven't been over my Finnish in a while. I think a lot of it has to do with those pure black circles under mine eyes.  And I'm sorry if the last post was too caustic, Abby. I really wasn't arguing to make a good or valid point, or to make a point. As always, there is lots of talk and not much thinking, as BLogs will do. But I'm sorry if I sounded bitterish. At least that's what I thought. Then again, I am an EMO kid.  And thus: how I get into trouble for running my mouth.
