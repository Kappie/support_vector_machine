Lorne and i can just hang out and it's all good. HOPEFULLY Lauren and Will can come over also..god i hope so. I mean...i know lorne and i arent just gonna sit there through a movie...haha but if we do something then will and lauren just might!! Oh boy..i hope liz doesnt come over and they do that...eeek! haha Its like after 2am and i still have to clean my room...hahaha omg and it's such a mess if u know me u know how scary it can get. Well...im sooo happy about lorne but then at the same time im wondering if its gonna be the slightest bit weird. I dont think it will be..who knows...i think everything will go ok and if it doesnt..then it wasnt meant to be. haha Ok, its like now 2:20 and i gotta clean my room and im about to pass out. Nite
