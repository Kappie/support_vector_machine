But I am just trying to understand what is going on in my life at this present moment. I am not sure where my life is taking me. But I do know that I dont want to take this trip alone. I just wish there was someone out there for me. SOMEONE, who would be there at least in my heart and in my mind. Even if they are not physically present. If a love is strong enough the mere thought of them would be good enough just to get through a rough day. With just a simple smile which would melt to the bottom of my heart.   One day I will find that person, maybe I will be able to fix the broken pieces that I have left of my heart. But until then I will sit here everyday wishing, praying, hoping that I would not be awake alone. I have to be strong! Be strong patience is a virtue and I would wait until my dying day because even on my last if you appeared at my dying moment my life would be completly into pieces.  YOU KNOW I CAN'T GET MY MIND OF YOU, GRAMS*.
