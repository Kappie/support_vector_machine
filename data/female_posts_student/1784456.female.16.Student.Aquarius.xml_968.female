Surely they're not shallow enough to sack him because of his social life, however perverted it is...eugh.    Anyway - Halloweeen partaaaaay...! Well, sleepover. I have vampire fangs! Mostly cos we're supposed to derss up as vampires and stuff for the orchestra-play thingie (which is in february) so I thought I may aswell get some while they're in the shops. Plus its an excuse to freak everyone out! I also have somegreen hair dye, which coukd be...fun (heh heh). "Hold still, I'll only spray a tiny bit on you...(sucker...what do you mean - "It looks terrible!"? It's great..."    Wow - Spung - "Wake up call" is so funny and true! Pure class...    Speaking of class - Look Around You is on tomorrow! This week it's about Ghosts! Could be funny!  urlLink www.bbc.co.uk/lookaroundyou         "SCIENCE stands for Super-Corroborative Information on Everything and Nothing in the Cosmos and Earth" Ahhh this website's funny!
