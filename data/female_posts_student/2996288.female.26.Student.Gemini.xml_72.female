I'm going to be in my late 20s soon.  Aren't I supposed to have more...stuff?  Houses and cars and beach-front property?  And...kids and all that jazz?  I don't feel old enough to be that old.  Not that 26 is old.  It is just older than I feel.  I feel 17.  That was a good age!  But then I'd be like  urlLink Doogie Howser  or something.  (Which, by the way, was just added to TVland's line-up)  What is the appropriate way to spend one's last week of 25-dom?  Any suggestions?  And what is the best way to usher in the onset of 26?  My plans right now consist of me singing Happy Birthday to myself.  With a cupcake.  And a candle.  And maybe a margarita.  Or a Diet Pepsi.
