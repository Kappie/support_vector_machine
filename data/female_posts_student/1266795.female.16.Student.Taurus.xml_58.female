I'm planning to have a part time job right after graduation in order to make some money for visiting you in 2006 summer!! (Plane ticket costs too much!!) I hope you would offer me some foods and place to sleepT-T Or else, i won't have enough money to go back!!!;   I'm majored in Chinese, and minored in French. But I don't speak them very well(both). OH, French. I CAN'T STAND THAT! I'm good in Korean of course. And I can understand English. But I'm far more comfortable in KoreanT-T. Too bad. I wish I was a genius in langaugesT-T   I love movies, and books, and SuperPeter And I always thank god for let me keeping in touch with you.  >
