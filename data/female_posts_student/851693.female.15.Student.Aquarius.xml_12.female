This week was tough, what with all the tests one after another. [am going to fail physics] But we did manage to squeeze in a few rehearsals. We did the Ruth/Francine scene, the I-can't-find-my-purse-must-be-gaoling-took-it scene, and the playground scene. We modified the script a little during the rehearsal.  Also, I'm supposed to re-write the last part of the script. The epilogue-thingy, where Young Ruth, Old Ruth, Young LuLing and Old LuLing come out. Suggestions needed! It's a bit messy now, with all the characters taking turns to say lines. Oh, and any suggestions as to how Ruth introduces Art? She goes, " Artâ€™s my live-in boyfriend of ten years. I first met him at a yoga class.  " But that's a little odd, right?  Oh well.  And to Michelle [Wong]: Keep the faith, yo. Great work so far! Speak louder. *grins*
