To tell you the truth I did not feel like coming back to work period. Don’t you just wish that we’d all don’t have to work. Don’t have any bills to pay for. Just chill and have tropical drinks ever now and then. In addition, eat delicious food everyday. Don’t have to worry about a single thing.  However, just smile the day away.   Vacation vanishes in quickness. So eternizing it was. I’d did some city hopping from Virginia, to Washington Dc, Atlantic city, New York, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Boston. With just a blink of an eye, here I am back at work again. It was nice to bond with families. I am gonna miss that so much. It won’t be anytime soon until I return. Let just say in the next ten years or so.   In a descent way I am mighty glad I’m back at home. Friends called me and asked if I would like to accompany them to Las Vegas in September. Going Jet Skiing and just have a blast out there again. I am so ready very ready to go to Vegas. Sure, count me in!!!
