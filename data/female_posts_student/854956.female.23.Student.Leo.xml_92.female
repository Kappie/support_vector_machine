You don't care about anyone or anything. You must be so proud    urlLink   which happy bunny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      And now for an update...    Port Aransas was wonderful!  We stayed at a condo place called Cline's Landing... it's about 4 blocks from the ferry port, and our balcony/patio looked out into the ship channel.  So, we saw lots of huge ships and little boats.  However, the coolest thing that we saw was dolphins.  Yep, we have dolphins in our Gulf waters, and we would see dolphins all day everyday, in the water right beneath our balcony.  At one point, we saw about 9 dolphins at once (and I mean, they all surfaced at the same time, so there's no chance we counted the same 2-3 dolphins several times).  It was fun to watch them... and every time a big ship would come through the channel, they'd go out and play in the water that they'd push in front of their crafts.  It was at this time that we realized there were some baby dolphins, too.  They'd jump completely out of the water, and they were just as cute as they could be.  I went out to the pool a lot, and on the beach a couple times, and so I got a bit darker.  :-)  We had a great time.  The only complaint I had is that my Grandma, being the older woman she is, is set in her ways, and she says some things that REALLY upset me.  Yep... racist things.  In addition to bugging me by doing this, she started in on me about every last detail of "Ricky" and would really start to get on my nerves by saying at LEAST once every waking hour that we should get married.  OY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I also had to sleep in the same room with her a couple nights... she snores... a lot.  And, as if she didn't talk enough during the day... she talks in her sleep.  One night, she made a sound like a ghost would make... "Wooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo."  It scared the SHIT out of me!  Anyhow...  We got back home yesterday, and we had already gotten tickets for the James Taylor concert at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater.  It was HELL getting onto Lookout Rd. and it was MORE Hell once we got off the access road and started down Lookout.  Fortunately for us, my Uncle Scott drives his little BMW like Mel drives her Corolla... he zipped past a bunch of people in the right lane (the WRONG lane) and then cut in front of some guy in the left lane.  We finally parked, and it was like, 8:10pm... James Taylor was supposed to start at 8... I'm glad that he didn't, because we got out of the parking lot and up near the front, and there was a LONG line forming to get into the show...  Well, anyhow... we got in, found our seats... and James came out about 10 minutes later.  He gave an AWESOME show... he did 3 encores... the last of which was Sweet Baby James.  If you've never heard it... it's a sweet song.  He is a much smarter man than I would've guessed.  He played all of his new stuff first... then played his older stuff at the end.  Oy... anyhow... there were some younger couples sitting next to my Dad.  And they collectively had about 14 beers.  Now, if you've been to Verizon, you KNOW that those beers are big... they aren't just whimpy cups.  Anyhow, they were VERY drunk by the end of the show... and for one of the songs, they stood up and were dancing around.  Some man behind us was yelling at them to sit down.  The very drunk guy that was sitting right next to my Dad turned around and said, "Stand up!!!"  Oh my... they exchanged some words... while we sat there afraid we'd get beer slung in our direction or something.  It was a bit scary... because the guy that was behind us and very angry... he wasn't a small man.    Well, that was my week and concert experience.  I'm glad to be home... I'm glad my Grandma's going home today... and I'm glad that I had a good time at the James Taylor concert w/o getting beer all over me.  I'll post something later!
