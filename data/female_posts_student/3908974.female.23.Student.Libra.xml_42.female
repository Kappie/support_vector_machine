I am just happy to be connected again, free to fill my shift with lots of happy shiny internet experiences.  The past few days have been as good as I could have hoped.  My man's home, finally, and we're still enjoying a mood of celebration about his return.  He came home three shades darker and a few inches skinnier, with lots of stories involving alcoholic binges and the police and the miseries of playing war games in the tropics.  What a trip.    He says he missed me, and I can't believe my good fortune.  Seems to me that I am a good woman and all that, but it's hard for me to believe that he finds me as beautiful as he does.  It's odd, but I could almost believe in the vision he has of me, that I am just so amazing.  But then again, it's in my interest not to care one way or another.  I will always be glad for the things he says to me.  No man ever has said them to me before.    We got crocked at a restaurant the other night and ended up weaving around downtown laughing at nothing.  And one night I had the best time sitting on the stoop with my roommate, talking about love and the meaning of life and smoking cigarettes.  I also had a sweet night of sleep last night, after a miserable day at work where I found myself dry heaving in the restroom from uncharacteristically bad cramps.  I took some pain pills I had squirreled away after a car accident a while back and floated off on a pharmaceutical wave to Dreamland.  And today it's raining like hell and I love it.  So life has been lovely, and it's funny how when I am happy I have little to say.  "And this too shall come to pass."  As little as this resonates with me these days, I feel that this is worth noting.  I remember telling a friend once that the only constant in my life has been the passage of time.  Time erases all hurts and minimizes all adversities.  Let go of something, and the current will pull you away and leave whatever it was washed up on some bank for someone else to find.  Keep something close, though, and time leaves it alone till you die.  I guess people ask me a lot of questions about how I have dealt with things like death and heartache, and I haven't done  a thing.  I just counted on time washing it away.  As I will be washed away, someday.  Anyway, enough of the 'deep thoughts.'  I just feel like it's something worth recalling.
