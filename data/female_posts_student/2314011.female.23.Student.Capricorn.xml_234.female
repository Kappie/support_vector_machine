But there is a third alternative.  Sometimes when you fall, you fly."  --Neil Gaiman, "The Sandman" urlLink      Realized it's been a while since I used the new picture feature, so I looked around my archives for something to celebrate summer's return.  Found this little piece from The Boy, done on a weekend not long ago.  It reminds me of a summer three years ago, sitting in Harley on an off-ramp, watching I-90 for any sign of the car we thought was following us back from Seattle.  While he kept watch, I read comics.
