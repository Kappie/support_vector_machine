He's playing the ps2 cos that gets his mind of things otherwise he'll hav a lil cry cos he misses his mommy and daddy. i feel so sorry, so young and innocent.   Yesterday we went to the city and it was great fun. We went with the Cruz's except tito art and Allister wasn't there. It was weird and kool cos we were all in pairs most of the time. Like our mum's were infront, i'd chill and talk to patrick, Di and Bernice would chat and the two lil boy (jeyar and nick) would randomly get lost. Even tho we didn't go on a shopping spree it was still hella fun. Like in Big W me and Pat sat in the elevator while it went to the different floors cos we 'missed' our stop. Plus my feet were killing me and i was too lazy to get up off my ass.  I've noticed now i'm ditching bernice more. not intentionally like i've noticed at parties or whenever other people my age are around i tend to talk to them.  And most of the time someone(fab 5) will say something like oh you ditched us again last night. I mean i can't help it cos i can be mature and talk about teen issues and stuff wid other teen filos that i don't see very often. And i can be stupid and a fool wid the fab 5 who i see all the time. Maybe they just don't see my point of view. What makes things worst is Bernice and I are drifting apart, at first we 'were' talking buddies we'd tell each other what was bothering us when we were down but now it's like 'meh' u wouldn't care. I don't know in time everything will heal itself and trust me i know from experience. I just don't know anymore!  well i better go put jeremiah in bed cos it's getting late.  peace out, take care monmon
