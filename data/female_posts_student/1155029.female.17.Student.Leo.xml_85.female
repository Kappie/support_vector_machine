     
      There aren't words.  But I’ll keep the purple blanket forever.  As you walk the streets of China I’ll lay in my bed with it around me, smelling and feeling like a beautiful night under the stars.  As you drift to college I’ll lay in on the couch and curl into it on sick days, or when I miss you most.   A reminder of you.  A memento of bliss.  A souvenir from paradise.
