I challenged Allison yesterday and today and beat her both times 6-4, 6-4. I truly hope that I can earn the vveerrry prestigious spot of first doubles. :-) Next year I'm going to be second singles! Yay!  Oh, and Suzanne said I looked skinner and asked if I was losing weight.  That's always a nice thing to hear.
