He got the day off and I had to work !  =P Brian and I both want to see  Hedwig and the Angry Inch .. Thanks for the heads-up. I'll try to rent it here. I hope they didn't ban it or anything. I hate the bible-belt !     All reading recommendations are welcome. I'm working on my sister's copy of  The Unmade Bed  right now. It's an anthology of erotic stories. So far, the stories have been pretty good. I sometimes read to Brian when the mood strikes.    Brian and I bought  The Fast and the Furious . He loves that movie !  The effects were great !  And I  love  Jordana Brewster !  She's so hot !   Wedding plans are slowly creeping along. We anticipate to finalize the guest list and order the invitations next week. My second fitting for my wedding gown is on the 27th -- and I am very excited. The gown fits like a glove !  As though it was made for me. My mom was teasing me about it. She said I can't gain weight between now and the wedding because if I do, my dress won't fit !  It really fits so perfect !  The only aspect that needed altering was the length -- as can be expected.    P.S. My holiday and gift stories are posted in my online journal ( urlLink http://ching.i85.net ).. There's lots of pictures, too !  Don't forget to check the archives !
