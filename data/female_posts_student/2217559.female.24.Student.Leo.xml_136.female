We ate at the Houston's Chuys which was weird. I am used to Austin's Chuys. It was fun though. My stepbrother and his girlfriend are nutz, I swear. They just crack me. We wound up sitting in the living for about two hours talking about random crap after dinner. They never seem to shock me with all of their weird questions. -another story-  Hmm, nothing much is new. Same 'ole same 'ole, I guess. I went to church yesterday which was nice. Had my little come to Jesus meetin' and that seemed to straighten a few things out in my head (always does). It was a small Methodist church close by my house in Houston. Don't think I will go back to that church but it definitely served it's purpose for me yesterday.  I am going to visit my grandmother this weekend (on Thursday) and I am very much looking forward to that. Just to spend a few days in the country with an out-of-range cellphone and no nonsense is going to be wonderful in general. I am hoping to spend some time eating blackberries and visiting with my little cousins as well.   I should run - must study! Big test (#2) on Thursday! Lots of love.
