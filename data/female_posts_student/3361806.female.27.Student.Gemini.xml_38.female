PHP releases PHP 5.0 MySQL releases so many products: database server, MaxDB, Cluster, etc.. They also release the commercial version of their product. The weakness point of their technology in my point of view is there is no support team in every country. If they have a strong support team, they definitely can take the share market of the same kind of product from the Big company.  for more information, please take a look at  urlLink  http://www.php.net   ,  urlLink  http://www.mysql.com
