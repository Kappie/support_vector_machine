We were also the bridesmaids in some persons wedding...that part  was a little odd :)  You know what.  I must be a pretty cool chick. Everyone is copying me.  Like, I got a blog and now like all my friends have one. Odd? I think not...I must just be super special and coool... Not only did all my friends get a blog they all have the same design as me. Lol. Sometimes tis fun to be copied but sometimes it gets a little annoying. :)  Lala  Its tuesday morning. I don't really like Tuesdays. Hmm...I feel sick and my hair looks absolutely aweful. But I can fix that. I  love straighteners. :D  Bye all you lovely people...  Laura
