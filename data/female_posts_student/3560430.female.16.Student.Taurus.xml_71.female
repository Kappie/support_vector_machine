Maybe this is why she wouldn't let you come over to my house tonight and "forgot" to answer her phone.  I feel very very bad for you. You were very tired last night. If you hgad been in a better frame of mind maybe a little less forgivable but it sounds like you were rather sleepy. You realise that if you have that conversation it's all going to turn around on your sleeping habits.   My daddy's uncle died. Very sad, he heard about it today at about seven. I hate it when adults are in misery, it seems so unnatural. i comforted him for awhile and then he told me a bunch of stories about his uncles. They were really funny most of which I've heard before but I got over that because they are really good and becasue he needed to talk.   OH! Bethie! Ya go for the Sears bed... Wait but the Ikea bed would go so much better... But the Sears bed... ikea... Sears. AAAAAHHHHHHH! I know what you mean.   Well  dinner is coming up so I had better go.   Crap I need to call Cate. I keep forgetting.
