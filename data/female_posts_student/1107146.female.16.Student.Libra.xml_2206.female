I was just looking around at these wusses, 23 posts ever by that person, 2 posts there, maybe 54 there, next to my massive, and truly EMO  eight hundred seventy three  (after this post) posts! That's sick! I've written enough words for a really goodly sized novel in BLogs (160,000+)! I'd really like to hear about the rest of you, but setting up the profile and all is actual work, albeit not much, but all the same. But if you ever get around to it, let me know.  It's just sick, but it makes sense, the last four on here have been mine. And I run at the mouth so damned much. I shouldn't be freaking out, I should be nodding my head in confirmation, with a confirmatory look on my face, eyebrows down, mouth locked in an "I knew it" or "I just ate a lemon" pose.
