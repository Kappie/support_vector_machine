Even though I probably should know what he's doing up there, I really don't want to know. I wanted to find something to do with friends tonight, but most of them are out of town at a volleyball thing or with their families. So, I stayed home on this Saturday night with my dad and we ordered a pizza. It was nice. I start school now in 11 days. I can't believe it. It'll be nice to see Fish D. :) That's about it. I got my haircut the other day. I got bangs. They're cute. They took awhile to get used to, but I do like them alot. I can do the punkish straight, ragged look or the cute, girly, side swept, whispy bangs. Man, I'm cool.
