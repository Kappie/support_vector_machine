Anyway... so here I am blogging once again. Hmm, so much has happened? Iunno.   Well, the day after tomorrow is Sudbury. I've finally raised $30. (I found some of my spare change in my OTHER wallet which totalled up to $10) and so yeah. But guess what? I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO TO THE PROMENADE TO GET MY BELOVED LIGHT BLUE COWBOY HAT! Haha! I'm such a freak. Anyway... so yeah. My mom says if we go on Tuesday after school, it'll be like... rush hour since everybody's getting off from work. She's not willing to go get it for me while I'm in school so I'm like: "NOOO!" Haha! Oh well! As long as I have my alien, it's all good. It's all that matters. Like I said before (gee, I'm so repetitive) I can lose anything but I just can't lose my alien. :)   I miss him... My mom and I dropped Julie off at her friend's house when I went to try on my grad dress again and we passed by Nima's house. (ahahaha! im so weird) I miss him so much. Meh. Ish all good. (o gosh... im turning into Moca! *mock horror*)  Anyway... This weekend has been THE MOST BORING weekend ever, thank you very much. All cos of the freakin rain and because I've been grounded off the freakin computer! My sister is now on my computer 24/7! Playing the stupid game Survival Project! Sheesh, I gotta uninstall that dumb game! It's taking up so much space on my computer! Plus, maybe if I take it off, my sister will stop going on my computer. Geez, she'll be here everyday! :O I'll even have to do something about my MSN Messenger! She'll be on it, no doubt, and reading my emails! Trust me, she does that! She went on my email last time and read 'em. Stupid sly idiot. She didn't know that you can always click "mark as unread" and make it look like she never read it. My mom and grandpa didn't know shit about computers and my sister denied reading my email. Geez, it was a really private one too. Grr! Little bitch...!  Hey hey, chillax! Don't get on my back! I'm a bit grouchy today so yeah. Blah... read a really cute, funny, and yet romantic manga at Rach's place. Grrr! Not gonna forgive Jae for stealing my seat! Hehe! Joking! Well, gotta bounce! XOXO~!
