And while that means my adoring public (as if I have one of those) knows less about what is going on in my life, it's mostly because there isn't much going on.  Busy with the four classes and the prelim paper, but it makes time go by quickly, if nothing else.   And, on that note, I need to get back to work.  I have to try to finish up what needs to get done today and then bake a cake.  Or should I work more tonight and bake the cake in the morning?  Hmm.  I dunno...
