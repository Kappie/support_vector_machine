We walked along Market, and went into Sephora (where else?), as well as miss sixty (European skank shop), and Rite Aid. By that time, my tummy was a-rumblin', so we took the bus to Ocean Beach for some lunch.    Embarassing moment of the day: On the way to the beach, my bladder decided to fill up, and I had the most irresistable urge to pee. My cross country bladder took over, so we walked for ten minutes, looking for a bathroom, but there wasn't any to be found! Finally, she tells me to just pee in the tall brush that's surrounding the sidewalk-- it's in the middle of the sand and cement, so in an act of desperation, I go. Unfortunately, I'm not trained to pee in a straight line, and she kept making me laugh while squatting, so a leeetle bit was sent off into the grass. I hope it doens't die a painful death.   So we snacked on the dead crabs and rotting jellyfish strewn across the shore (actually, I brought mi sanwich de lechuga and garbanzo beans, and she had Triscuits), and walked around a bit. Then, after we had had enough sea spray, we got back on the bus and walked to the MoMA.   Excellent stuff at the MoMA SF. If you're planning on going, go now before the exhibits change. Unfortunately we didn't have that much time, because I had to hurry back for a piano lesson, but the most memorable: Sculpture of giant spiders. The largest was one and a half my height, and there were four or five slightly smaller ones clustered under its belly. Large forest room. The art was the walls, but there were some abstract and seemingly random things placed strategically around the room. Diego Rivera painting. The title had something about symbolism in it. Loved it. Black painting. A huge canvas with tarred-up newspaper thrown on, and glossed over with black. A little weird close up, but very effective. A huge pencil/charcoal drawing with so many different things in it. One of my favorites, too bad I don't remember the artist. A toilet. Put on display not because it was scuplted, but because it was "chosen" by a famous artist. Ha. Woman with fruits (or fruit hats or something like that). Matisse. The one you've seen everywhere. Okay, if you want more, pick my memory, but I suggest you go see it yourself. See them yourself. All of them. So after that, we ran to the BART station and back home, I fell asleep the whole way back, and then I went to my okay piano lesson. Wheeee.
