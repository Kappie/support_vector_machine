Each performance, each muster parade is just as important as any other. Each is led by countless amount of rehersal and practising. Till now, there isn't a single time when I am not nervous during the event. Since the sec4s seniors left, the pressure and stress upon us had evaporated like water. But when they come back, there is a feeling of guilt. Until now, I'm still not able to detect whether a pitch is sharp or flat. My rhythm is just as messy and unclear as before. And my embroshure is still not right. I'm so worried. Tomorrow is the day. The whole school will be there to watch us, our class, our seniors, our teachers and our principals. There is a lot of stress created, especially on the student conductor, Nizam. I remember vaguely seeing him putting the baton down with frustration with fanfare was over and we didn't get to play it at all. His brows were furrowed, a frown upon his face, his eyes staring straight with hatred. I don't want anymore mistakes to occur this time but mistakes can't be avoided. The more nervous you are, the more stressed you will become. But the whole school is out there! This is just Nizam's second conduct of the parade. I bet he is so nervous that he bound to break down any moment. Stress upon stress, the seniors knew that our band had been "Deproved" since they left. They had high hopes in us, they wanted us to get Gold, otherwise will only result in the retrench of Mr Ong. But I really don't know what to do, in this hopeless state we're in. Players we want, they left. Players which we want to kick out, they stay. I really really had no idea how long this band is going to survive. Kaingee just reprimanded me on how awful we had sounded. I really can't avoid that, the juniors all wanting to early depart because of their parents' wishes. I understood and I appreciated how much freedom my parents had both given me. They gave me no limits to freedom, the latest is during the concert until about 12am. I felt so frightened that time, my parents were not there to fetch me and I was walking, almost running on the deserted street, desperate for a source of light and hope... This is the time. The whole school will be out there. It's the judgement which the principal is going to give, the vision of the other part of the school on the band. This is a test, the only barrier we had to cross. This is the time, the right time. Although I am not filled with high hopes but I'm sure we'll do well!
