It's one of my favorite love stories I've read. Alright, so I haven't read  that  many, but it's still one of my faves. It's about a principal's daughter and a troublemaker. Mmmhmmm. How do you guys like love stories anyway?  Hunting ghouls at Gothador. Muahahhaha. I'm almost at level 14. Now my AP regen rate is 18 minutes. Yay. I'm going to get sword of speed and equip myself with it when I'm not hunting. Mmmhmmmm. Yesssss.
