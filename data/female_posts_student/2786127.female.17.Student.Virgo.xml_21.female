I got John in trouble with his girlfriend yesterday, for having sex in his car. Just jokeing...though thats what she probably thinks, when in actuality he drove to chruch with me. Ridiculous.  The O.C. has lost it's appeal to me, sadly enough. I miss having episodes of Sex in the City to watch, must go rent season 2.... but before that, i need to go to school.   Jessica
