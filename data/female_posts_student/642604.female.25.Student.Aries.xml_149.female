And when you're manic depressive and feelings basically get the better of you all the time, nice is a pretty amazing feeling.  I love everyone tonight... and no I am not drunk... so thanks to everyone who helped make the day so nice." ~My away message on IM  I don't know if it's the beautiful weather or if it was the hot chai but it was a really great evening.  I didn't do anything special or spend time with anyone special but for the moment I am just so happy being in my own skin and that hardly ever happens.  I know I can be bitchy and I know I have a temper like a tornado but in the end I am a good person.  I hide behind sarcasm and witt but I'm working on it.  Most of you know why I do it, why I built up this wall so quickly but trust me I am working very hard to tear it down.  Cause I like the days when I can be honest and not worry that people will hurt me, I like the days when I can feel the need to tell someone how much I appreciate them instead of just cutting them off at the knees so that they don't get too close.  I love that each person I know, despite their faults and mine, has brought something new into my life.  I like that, despite what everyone thinks, I can forgive so easily.  I love that, whether you see it or not, I am a hopeless optimist and a die hard romantic. I like that I try so hard to be friends with people, even when they don't want to reciprocate because it means I see something in so many that is worth having in my life.  I like that once in a while, even though I don't hear it back often, I can be honest for a moment and tell people how much I like having them in my life.  I like that I have the ability to step outside myself for a moment and really see my thoughts (this is why my therapist doesn't think I need therapy anymore cause I just analyze myself) and my faults for what they really are.  I love that I am so passionate and feel so intensely that most of the time I have a really hard time thinking before I speak or censoring my reaction to things.  I love that I still dream like a child, that I still have all the hopes and ambitions I had when I was five, that I never gave up on those silly ideas that started almost twenty years ago.  I love that I am high drama, not my life but me, because it goes back to reacting so quickly and so outwardly to anything I feel.   I love that I don't give up so easily on people and that I keep trying until someone has to literally just say stop, and even then I don't give up quickly.  I love that I care about everything.  I love that I have a family who encourages me no matter how many times I screw up, they believe in everything I do.  I love that music can dictate my mood and that there is something out there like music that I can build my life around, because how beautiful is that?  How amazing is it to know what you love and what you need to be around?  I love that I can take the time to sit down and write out my sappy thoughts and not be afraid that others will read them.  And most of all, I love feeling content and nice just because at the end of the day I know that no matter what anyone else thinks I am a good person, I do care about each and every one of you and I think about you all the time... no matter what you think of me.  Now, I am going to get my dog and head outside for one last cigarette before I go to bed because there is nothing more amazing than night time at this time of year.  Good night.
