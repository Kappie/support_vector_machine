Im not even gonna stress pety shit thats goin' on in mah life right now. So Mothafuckin' focused right now. Just tryna spend some time with tha fam, get a job, go out - dont give a fuck bout nuttin' else. On dawgs, these past couple days have been mad weird, its like everything i let go of, be comin' back to me. Its like that Quote - "if your lofe somethin' - let it go, if it comes back to your, its yours. well he's mine then.   smh, tell me why this nigga, Natas, needs to be tellin' me that he wants shit back and he like me and its seems like i like him, so we could have somethin' goin? It was like 9 when he called, i havent talked to him in tha ill minute (prolly round 3 months) we ended up talkin for 6 hours straight. I told him he could call me again - im supposed to talk to him tonite and we supposed to cheel tomm - but i highly doubt it. I'll see how shit goes. If things go good - that'll be nice. If it don't - I dont give a FUCK! Niggas like him aint shit- Pussy feein' motha fuckas.   Bitches these days be lettin' their lives be takin' ova by men. Fuck all that shit, and fuck what they got to say about it. Blinded by "love" whatever the fuck that word means. I know damn well it don't mean he say jump, she say how high, or vice versa. So fuck em all. I'd be damned if i let a man take ova my life!
