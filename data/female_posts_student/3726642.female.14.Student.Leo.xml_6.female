The majority of known executions of juvenile offenders was in the USA (6 since 1990).   Great list to be on, eh?  But really, I have mixed feelings about the death penalty,especially when it concerns kids (yeah, I see the richness in me saying that considering I'm 13).  As an atheist I can look at it two ways:                 -Death is the sweet relief that those who deserve the death sentence don't deserve                 -Death is the way to destroy him, the whole eye for an eye thing that is more of a justice thing then a 'make the bastard suffer' thing   The first one is what I stand by (yeah, aren't I a vicious little sprite) because I think anyone who kills so many times or so heinously doesn't deserve to die, they don't deserve the peace of being nothing any more-they should suffer living in prison and knowing that they will remain there forever, knowing that they are hated and that if they were to be freed society will never forgive them for what they've done.  I suppose the reasoning those with religion use is that when they are dead, God will judge them and punish them according. So death isn't just taking someone's life but sending them to whatever version of hell they believe exists.  Of course I stopped believing (if I ever really did) in that silliness years ago so the question I must ask is, Is it better to not exist, or to exist for years, decades in jail before not existing? Is living worse then not existing?  Once I clear that up with myself I'll tell you which side of the capital punishment fence I'm on.  Til then-I'll meet you on the fence post.
