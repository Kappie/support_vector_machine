I feel new, found, clean, cold, crisp... a new dollar bill if you will... or a 10 or 20 seeing as how we dont have 1's here in good ol Canada... I've lost some weight, I've been kinda sick for the past couple days, crying and all... not being able to keep down food for long, not being hungry, not getting enough sleep, not being able to take care of myself well enough. Maybe unconciously I have been telling myself I am not thin enough and havent been eating basically at all... I really dont know because I dont know how my mind works. All my muscles hurt, I need an all over massage. Masochistic and makes you tingle when its done. Speaking of which, I think I have lost all desire to cut myself. ALL DESIRE. It's disgusting... I was disgusting for doing it. It hurts now, it doesnt feel good anymore... it just hurts... Bleeding isnt as beautiful anymore. I am listening to Champagne Supernova and the sounds of the water at the beginning make me miss the ocean so much. I want to see it again... so very soon. I want to go with Rem and just make love by the ocean... I just want to get on a bus with him and disappear... not tell anyone where we are going and just wander and be in love. I want us to be happy where ever we are but I dont want to be here. I just want us to be together, to belong to each other but not be mere possesions. I want to love him like he deserves. I love Rem North with all that I am. .:Sam (aka. Crazy in love.):.
