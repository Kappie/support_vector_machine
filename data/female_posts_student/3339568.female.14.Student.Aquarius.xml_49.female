All anyone cares about is exams, marks, results, tests. This is not what it's about. Why does it matter? Even we make big deals about it. My friend Melissa (aka. Bubs) decided that this year she wouldn't tell anyone her exam marks, and you wouldn't believe the crap she got from people who were obsessed with finding out what she got!And my other friend Loz, gets sooo stressed about exams, she is in tears during nearly the whole time, becomes depressed and once I was even scared she was gonna hurt herself. How can people allow this 2 happen? We are only  kids  for God's sake. Stress is known to shorten your life span and cause many other  urlLink detrimental physical effects on the body.  We shouldn't be put in these situations. Like I got my Maths exam back not long ago, and I got 70%, but seeing as I am in the top class, i scored "signifigantly below average" on nearly every section ('cept algebra, algebra rox!) And the teacher had to have a "chat" with me at lunch about my "dissapointing" exam mark. The pressure ended up finally getting to me and I was in tears in English. After I got over being upset, I felt angry. Why is society so exam-driven? It's not right. There are other ways to measure intelligence. Not everyone works well in an exam situation. I'm quite annoyed right now. Why is the pressure to acheive so great? Is this pressure going to have detrimental effects on our future generations? Who is to blame?
