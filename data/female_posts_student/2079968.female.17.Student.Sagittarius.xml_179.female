Hopefully upon leaving for vacation I can break my "writers block" or...not much interest in posting right now.  Wow. Upon reading that, I realize how much a vacation will do me good. I have a lot to say, I think. I just think I'm suffering from a mental overload and I need time to just...chill out? I dunno.  So, armed with my camera and my last bit of sanity, I bid thee farewell.
