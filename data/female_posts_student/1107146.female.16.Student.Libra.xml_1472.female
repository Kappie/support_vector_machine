But uh, kinda harsh at the end there, don't you think?  Anyway, VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT...  Yall know Elizabeth's cousin, Gael?  Famous for awesome jokes, puns, quotes, etc.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, maybe less, she was diagnosed with monterous cancer all over, basically, called something like "carcinoma without given cause" or something like that.  Well, she passed away a few hours ago.  They were very close.  She's the one that took Liz to Ren Fest every year and stuff.  Needless to say, Elizabeth is very upset.  She's kind of closed herself off from the public right now for obvious reasons, but might I suggest a call here in a day or two?  She's been wanting company for a while, as we all know, but now is probably the time of most need, so we need to make sure everything is taken care of.  Food, company, all we can do.  She's been through a lot lately.  Really, it is the least we could do to help.
