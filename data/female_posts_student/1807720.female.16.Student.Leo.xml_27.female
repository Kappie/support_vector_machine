I don't really feel comfortable yet and it's really hard especially for Math because I really need help but I don't know really how to ask the right way because I don't feel a trust level with that teacher yet.  And well her teaching style is really not matched with mine at all - I never understand what she is doing because she will explain something but will not go through the steps of how to do the problem and she usually shows like one or two examples and expects the rest of the problems to be tried out on our own - well that  *DOESN'T*  work because if I don't understand how to do something in the first place I won't know how to try it and get it right.  I've cried just about everyday so far this week and well I had a talk with Chels yesterday and that helped me figure out things but there are still other things that I haven't talked to her about and that maybe I need to figure out on my own.  I just really hope on Monday my TA or McDougall will be there so they can explain the math to me because that is really my only hope right now.  I feel so energy drained and kind of dumb, I feel like everyone else is good at math and I'm not, everyone is maybe better than me at chem, and so on.  That is just how I feel right now but I don't want to feel that way.  I am so confused and I am having feelings that I might fail math which would ruin everything.  It would ruin my whole life because of course my dream of becoming some sort of Science teacher would be ruined and well I need Pure Math 30 for that and well I have to pass my Sciences too.  I am having second thoughts about my career choice but not that I really want to.  I mean I  *KNOW*  that I want to be a teacher but I don't know what kind of teacher.  I really love science, in fact I always have really liked it but I am not the strongest at it, and well Math I would never want to teach anyways, English I am really not strong in reading comp at all and I NEVER understand that stuff so that would be out of the question, and even though in Social I usually pull off a good mark it just doesn't interest me the way in which Science does.  So I am just really confused, don't know how things are going to turn out, all I really want right now it to just be hugged - for someone just to hold me and tell me everything will be ok.  But I don't know if things will be ok or what is going to happen, there is no one here right now.
