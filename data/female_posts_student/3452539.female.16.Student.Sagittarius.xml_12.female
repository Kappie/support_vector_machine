Well, maybe a coffeehouse celebration tonight...except the group it was with (lucky college students who have been out for a while mocking me) called and said there was a change of plans. Since this is "my night", I am scared shitless. I have no idea what they are doing. I am sure it will be wicked fun though. Er...should I dare to say that?   Battlecry, as Brian would say:  Crackie3312003:  wpi t-minus one day and counting  Or...Boston...or...well...I do not know. I am not treading on that ground quite yet.   I am so glad that I have used writing so much as an opportunity to eliminate conjunctions from my written vocabulary. It saved so much time and grief on my history final. That is her big things, and now I am fairly accustomed to automatically avoiding them. There are a few cases where you are screwed because the sentence is so awkward without those little partial words with commas. If you try to say it properly you seem wicked British...or royal...or old...or something!   What else.  Did I mention that I am free? lol, sorry. Good feeling. Academic stress = non-existent. This week anyways. I am going to relax before starting the English work.   Did I mention, I finally get to see my tehanu soon? Well, you know the deal :-D  I am such an asshole for again falling asleep. It is called caffine Janine!!!! Dang.   I know there were things that I wished to actually post...but they have gone over my head again.  Working on the yearbook last year again another person that I met commented on how I look like someone that they know. How could anyone else look like me? I have never seen them...but I do feel badly for them if that is the case.   They also commented on how frequently I show up. 19 times. I love pictures, what can I say? I do not care how dumb I look in them, that is the fun part that makes you look back and laugh. There are a few I actually really like too.   I tried to nail Tony for showing up a lot, but I have him beat by three. Woo hoo. That is what he gets for making me run across a hot parking lot barefoot to get the frisbee...that I did a horrible job throwing...lol Actually he got most of them, which was appreciated. Frisbee is fun!   Um, I should stop huh? Since who knows what is happening tonight and I will probably update again. SAT scores Friday...I guess I will have to wait unless I can talk someone into checking and give them...my password...sniff. I should change that to something pointless then change it back after...hmmm  Okay, like I said, I am done.   Tengo muchos muchos ganas de menos de ti, Matt, me amo ti mucho, como nada en este mundo!
