I am terribly unimaginative ^^;   --Name: Caleigh Jean Minshall --Birthdate: October 11th, 1988 --Birthplace: Credit Valley Hospital; apparently it was a terribly traumatic experience, I took 12 hours and my mom vowed never to go back to that hospital again. She didn't, either. I was born right on my due date though, which is pretty cool. --Current Location: Bedroom, Caledon East, Ontario, Canada --Eye color: Blue-grey --Hair color: Brown --Height: 5'4 *sigh* --Righty or Lefty: Right --Zodiac Sign: Libra! Woo! Go scales!  --Innie or Outtie: Innie, obviously. Do I seem like an outtie person??   // Ver. 2 - Describe   --Your Heritage: Irish / English / French-Canadian. Izgood, izgood. --The Shoes You Wore Today: Black leather school dress shoes --Your Weakness(es): Overly critical of myself and others. Hugely high expectations. At times I am a total introvert and hate people (as unlikely as this may seem to some). I don't like leaving my house, or travelling, unless I know exactly what I'll be doing or whatever. Does not get along well with strangers ^^; --Your Fears: Mostly just that I'll die lonely. I wouldn't mind if I was just alone, but if I was lonely, that would be sad. That's why  Scent of a Woman  touched me so much -- I'm afraid I'll end up like the Al Pacino character from that movie. Also, I'm afraid of the dark ^^; not nighttime dark, but alone dark, when it's all quiet and spooky. I have a far too active dreamlife for that to be healthy. --Your Perfect Pizza: Cheese, pepperoni, whatever. Long as it's not raw or oozy. --One thing You'd Like to Achieve: finish my own book ^^; write a song, whatever. Something that I'm satisfied with, though.   // Ver.3   --What is(are) your most overused phrase(s)?: "Wowie!" "Fantastically awesome" "Insanely fantastically awesome" "Mad-crazy, man!!" --Your first thoughts waking up: Take me now, O Lord... --The first feature you notice in the opposite sex: Sense of humour, and apparent intelligence --Your best physical features: Hair, I guess. Eyes -- but just the eyes, not the bugginess around them (damn allergies). And I like my skin, too ^^; --Your bedtime: 10pm on school nights, and 11 on weekends. Without fail. *g* Early to bed, early to rise, makes a girl healthy, wealthy and wise! --Greatest Fear: Dying lonely, definitely. --Your Most Missed Memory: When I could still tell people about how I had my own world full of heart-creatures and trolls, and they'd think it was sweet and original, not weird.   // Ver.4   --Pepsi or Coke: Coke --McDonald's or Burger King: McDonald's, now. McFlurries, mmm.. --Single or Group Dates: Group, until the guy and I were better friends. Single could get awkward ^^; --Adidas or Nike: NIKE. Because they have a great slogan. "DO IT." How many slogans can be so blatantly applied to sex?? --Chocolate or Vanilla: Chocolate!!!!! Yes, A, I agree with you there. --Cappucino or coffee: Iced capp! I tried T's at Anime North, and it was soo gooood... plus, Tim Hortons! Not Starbucks! Woo! --Boxers or Briefs: Boxers, definitely. Boys who wear briefs are queer.   // Ver.5   --Do you smoke?: Never. But I love the smell of fresh cigarette smoke ^^; --Cuss?: Only sometimes --Sing Well?: Nah. I can hit notes, mostly, but I don't have that great a voice. --Do you think you've been in love?: Nope. Except with my dog. Yes, I'm in love with my dog. Go to hell. --Want to go to college: OF COURSE. Jeepers creepers... life without learning is like life without ... living... *blinkblink* --Liked High School?: Sure. I don't get along with many of my fellow students, but the teachers are all awesome. --Want to get married?: LOL A! This is why I love you! And  no , I don't want to get married. If I meet the right person, I'll get married. If not, I won't. Simple. I ain't lookin' for a husband *g* --Type with fingers on the right keys: Constantly. People who chicken-peck bug me ^^; --Get motion sickness: Only when I've read in the car for too long. But I love roller coasters and that kinda thing, so I guess I don't get motion sickness too bad. --Think you're attractive: Sometimes. Other times I think I look like a corpse. I don't think I'm so much attractive as loveable ^_~ --Think you're a health freak: God no --Get along with parents: Very much so! I love 'em. Everyone always complains about their parents, but mine are the bestest ever. --Like Thunderstorms: Yeah!!   // Ver.6 - in the past month, did/have you:   --Consumed Alchohol: ewwww no! --Have Sex: ewwww no! --Made Out: ... ewwww no! --Gone On Date: *sigh* NO! --Go To the Mall: nope --Eaten an entire box of Oreos: every day, man.. every day --Eaten Sushi: ewwww no! --Gone Skating: ewwww no! ^^; I  watch  people skate. I don't skate myself!! --Made Homemade cookies: ewwww no! ^^;;; --Been in Love: only with Ivy!  --Gone Skinny Dipping: *shifty eyes* nooo... --Dyed your hair: of course not --Stolen Anything: Nope.  // Ver.7  --Have you ever played a game that required removal of clothing?: hee. Yes --Been trashed or completely intoxicated: never! --Been caught "doing something"?: Look, if you're gonna "do something," at least be  discrete  about it... IDIOTS. --Been Called a "Tease": of course not. Me, tease?? --Shoplifted?: nah.   // Ver.8   --Age you hope to be married?: Look up for an answer to this whole marriage thing. --Numbers and Names of Children?: 2 to 4 kids. No idea what the names will be. I like the name Christopher, though... and Taylor. O.O Tristan!! ^^;;;; --Describe your dream wedding: Small, in the country, lots of flowy white material. Apple orchard! Tiny rural church, only close friends and family. The family that I like, at least ^^; --How do you want to die?: I'm immortal. I don't die. --Where do you want to go to college: MCGILL! Well, anywhere that's got a super-good social science program --What do you want to be when you grow up?: Professor of history/philosophy/etc.? Historian? Writer? Musician? ... possibilities are endless. Don't forget that. --most like to visit?: Wales! Big castles and lots of green. That'll make me happy any day.
