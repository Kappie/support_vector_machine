Then I sat around for another hour until I started working on a new harness. This one was one of the ones that we like to call a "pain in the ass". Some of the earlier models are a real pain because they are a huge mess, not a lot of the information we have is correct, and there are a lot of wires that must be disconnected and reconnected for specific reasons. Anyway, dad does these kinds of harnesses for a little more money than normal because they a such a pain. The shop that he has charges something like 700 dollars for a harness to be mailed to you and not installed. I get 125 usually. But this harness they were getting 100 dollars more for because it is such a pain. It is not any more work for the people at the shop or for my dad, only for me, as far as my dad says anyway. So don't you think that I should be paid for the extra work that I have to do? I spend at least 2 hours more than usual doing work and since I don't get paid by the hour it doesn't make any difference. But where does this extra money go? To the shop. And they aren't the ones doing the extra work I am and I don't get paid extra for it? Dont you think there is something wrong with that? Oh well shit happens. So I worked for a while on it and then went to bed. woohoo.
