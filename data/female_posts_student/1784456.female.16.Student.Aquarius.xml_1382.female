(Hehe... actually I'll probably find a internet bar some where so I can delete my junk mail!) *sob sob* All the mail I get it junk! Unless... I'm deleting all the non-junk mail. ^_^; Hehe... Eeek! Nahhh! Any way... zzz... so tired! Ooooh! I better go phone Izzy, she thinks that lent is over on Monday! (Dumbo!) Aaah! She might break the fast a few days before it ends! That would be bad! Okay, so I'm hyper on the net, but whacked out in real life... why can't it be the other way around?  What if we died in silence, No on heard the scream. What if no one saw, The body that was never seen. Why won't some one stop them, The murderers in the world. Why won't some one help us, Bring peace to all. When it is right in front of you, Staring you in the eyes. Why won't some one help, The Palestinian's lives.
