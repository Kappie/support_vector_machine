I smoked approximately 950 cigarettes, drank at least 180 diet cokes and 120 cups of coffee.  I've eaten probably 35 salads from the union.  (And yet no food poisoning!)  I wrote over a hundred pages in assigned work, not counting my other stuff.  Won't bother trying to figure how many pages I read and beers I had.   Suffice to say it was a lot.  Spent all night last night writing.  Second night in a row, and it was like old times with my roommate.  We developed this bizarre ritual last semester when we were both really getting schooled.  I was taking 18 hours of grad level stuff, and she was writing some big scary honors thesis.  We'd come home after work and go on these paper-writing benders where we'd put on our pajama pants and make pots of coffee and take hourly breaks to go stand out on the stoop and freeze our asses off while we smoked.  Sometimes there would be wine, which made my papers entertaining.  We'd do this for days in a row, sleeping maybe two or three hours a night until we got so addled we could hardly make sense anymore.  We'd start laughing for no reason.  I had tunnel vision sometimes.  It's funny what you miss, isn't it?  I had a big revision due today for a teacher I like very much and whose opinion I value a lot.  I'm really pleased with what I came up with in the deep hours of last night, but I'll be happy when I've handed it to him and I don't have to think about it for a while.  I read one of his books last weekend.  It was goddamn good.  Made me laugh.  It got a lot of acclaim when it came out, but I don't think he's put out much since, and it's been a while.  In any case, I am lucky I get to study with this guy.  We're doing a directed study this summer, and he already said that our primary project will be to polish up some of my existing work and get it published somewhere.  (!)  My only publications thus far have been in tatty local magazines.  My dad called last night at about 1:00, which is really late for him.  Usually my folks cash in around ten because they get up at the crack of dawn, even on the weekends.  I'd accidentally speed dialed him while I was out and about.  He left a message that went like this:  "Hello Daughter.  Are you calling me or are you really calling me?  Did you fall asleep and roll over on your phone again?  Are you in a ditch somewhere?  Well.  This is your old man.  Call me back."  I really love the hell out of my dad.  I didn't write this before because I did not want to think about it, but I saw a bit of the Nick Berg beheading .  It's been a few days, but sometimes when I close my eyes I still see that anonymous hand holding that poor kid's head, his slackened face.  Christ what a horrifying way to die.    Please let me be fortunate enough to go easy, in a car wreck or a hunting accident, or sudden one morning, maybe just dropping to the floor and quitting before I even realize it.    On that note-
