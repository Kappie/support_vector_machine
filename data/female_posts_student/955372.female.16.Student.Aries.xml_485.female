And cloe (chloe? i don't know they both look wrong) was like on the other side of the pond, and we're just like, yeah whatever she knows where we are. And then this guy and his dog were like walking by and the dogs like run at his dog and like cloe tries to attack it. And we spent like ten minutes trying to give the guy his dog back, and then like two minutes (not even) later the same thing happens, and all the dogs are wet from the last scuffle (because it took place near/in the streamlet) and we're like trying to get the zorro and g on the leads but g wasn't wearing a collar so madeline goes "just put the loop around her neck" as she's like holding her out away from her. And then g just like squirms out of it, runs two feet and sits next to a tree. Then that guys dog was like chasing her so i run up and get her and the dog is like jumping on me trying to sniff g's ass. And then cloe runs away and i run and get her while the dog is like leaping on me meanwhile madeline is trying to control zorro and g and the guy's dog (who had run back her direction) and then she grabs hold of the guy's dog and it's like running around her trying to sniff zorro and like madeline's like spinning with the dog meanwhile the guy is like trying to grab his dog and like he had to like hug madeline's legs to reach it. It was amazing. And we were like cracking up the whole time. Maybe you had to be there for it to be funny.But the best part was that this time we got to be the weirdos at the park, it's usually the other way around.
