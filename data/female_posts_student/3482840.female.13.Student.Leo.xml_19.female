And my uncle is getting me the Cheetah Girls DVD 4 my birthday! Which is in, 33 days but still. It's all good in the hood. Not that I LIVE in the hood but hey! *lol* Y'all gotta know I know what I mean.   There's not very much going on though. I'm SOOO bored ALL the time. My mom might be getting a job at Holly Hill though so that's cool. I found a stuffed hampster that looks just like Smurf! That's all 4 now so, L8TR DAZE!!!
