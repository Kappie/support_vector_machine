Girls Camp was actually really really fun. Like, i shirked all my duties, and i was totally a jerk to "my girls" but i went into town a bunch and hung out and went to mcdonalds and rebelled and broke rules. and i liked it. i became really good friends with these other girls from other wards, as well as many in our ward. well we became closer. i met these girls named Kristie (special K) and Sarah. and kristie called me mike jones cause she couldn't remember my name, which was fine by me. they were and still are, hillarious. we're totally hanging out all week. except like, when i'm at party's. or running in race for the cure. ah well. i've got some fan fiction to read. a novel to write. my journal to update and finish up. some sleep to get. some boys to dream of. some party's to plan and unplan. a summer to rock.
