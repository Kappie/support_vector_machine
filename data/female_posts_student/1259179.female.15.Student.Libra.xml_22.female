On Sunday we went to church, what a great sermon, we came home and the girls gave me their gifts.  Valerie gave me a little ceramic pot that she made with a beautiful card.  Melanie gave me a little pin made of dough and some coupons for me to cash in for some extra hugs and help cleaning the floor.  What great little girls I have.  On Moday I sepnd the afternoon with  urlLink    ~ Sandee ~   .  Had lunch, laughed, going to Chapters, laughed.  We had fun...      ~ Love you Honey,  let's do it more often ~     On this have a great HUMP day and.............Be Good
