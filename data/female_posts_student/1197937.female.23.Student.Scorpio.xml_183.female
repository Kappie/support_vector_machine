(with the exception of my mom:  aiya! so many black people!! ) well, right now, i'd much rather be freezing my a$$ off than suffering this sweltering heat. i feel like a human slushy that can't get through the day without two naps and a fudgesicle.  i went on my first trail hike this weekend at eaton canyon. it was a lot more physically demanding than i'd expected. as we traversed over rugged slopes and turbulent streams underneath the full moon, i thanked my lucky stars for deciding to leave my manolos at home.   i also watched starsky  hutch over the weekend. i think it was pretty funny, but i can't say for sure. i was constantly distracted by these wonderful fantasies of walking down the red carpet one day on the arm of this man:     now that's one kind of  caliente  i wouldn't mind. (the one on the right)  i also ate really bad sushi on sunday. after that, i was pretty sure i'd be abstaining from fish for a good couple of years.  for dinner tonight, my mom baked salmon with sweet onions drowning in XO sauce. that marked the end of my fish fast. i now have food coma on top of heat stroke. goodbye.
