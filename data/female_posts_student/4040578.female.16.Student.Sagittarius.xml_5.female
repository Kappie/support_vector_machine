READ AT YOUR OWN RISK EVERYDAY ...Anywho, life is good (well yesterday and today at least) Yesterday, after church I travelled up to Borders with my mom to see the lovely and talented Emerson Drive. Ahhh, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. They sung two acoustic songs "Last One Standing" and "November" then signed CD's. Well, Me being the fan I am have both of there CD's and you better believe it, I got them signed. I even got to have the lead singer put his arm around me for a picture (that is whenI just melted). I tell ya, that is such an experience. The only other autographs I have are from the Pacers back in the day of Larry Bird, Rik Smit,Dale Davis,etc. and then Chely Wright but I didn't get that one on my own. Not only is it an experience just to receive their autographs seeing the performance is breathtaking too. I went to the Country Music Expo earlier this year and that was awesome, and of course I have been to alot of the sporting events around the city.     Ok, well look for further blogging. Cause unlike some..no names mentioned..I will do my best to update daily!        Music Playin' In the Background: Rescued-Emerson Drive
