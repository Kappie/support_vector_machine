Yesterday Canadian Idol was also sooooooo awesome I mean Billy Klippert was awesome.  When my Dad was leaving from Calgary and going back to Vancouver we saw him at the airport.  He shook my Mother's hand and he hugged me.  Oh how lucky I really am!  Meanwhile I really think that it is Jenny Gear's time to go, in fact I never thought she should have even made it to Canadian Idol.  Toya was much better than Jenny, I mean Jenny can't sing - all she does is move her mouth and it is painful for me to listen to her.  My mom says she looks like one of those Hudarite people..LOL!  When I actually think about that it is so true!  I think that Canada judges way to much on appearance instead of like  REAL  talent!  And well my mom is at the Foothills hospital right now because Ben's dad is dying of cancer and they think he is going to go soon.  But well I think my Grandma is taking us out for dinner tonight - none other than the one the only...Zellers!  LOL.  That is like her favourite restaurant but well me and my mother would rather have a plate of ribs or Chinese...YUMMMM!  Oh well, I won't be greedy, I should just be lucky that I am actually going to go somewhere tonight  Lately everyone has been working!  Chelsey especially has been on the go non-stop and well she doesn't have a single class with me in grade 11 and well I don't know when we will even talk or see each other except for maybe Fridays cause we all usually hang out on Fridays.  School is only a week away now and well I am getting a bit more excited but a little nervous.  Just hopefully everything goes well and well I plan to ace Chemistry and hopefully that will happen!  Last year I don't really know what happened, I was good at anything that involved Science except for in Grade 10.  This year I hope to turn things around a bit, but of course still keep my good Math mark.  And knowing how Math last year was a big emotional roller coaster it will be even more difficult this year.  But well I took Physics and have it in the 2nd Semester and well last year I wasn't all that great at it and now I am having second thoughts about it.  I was so confident before that I wanted to do it though, and well I think after doing Math 20 Pure in the 1st Semester I should be able to handle it.  I will probably just try it for a while and see how it goes.  It would be pretty funny though if that ended up to be my highest mark.  I mean anything can happen can't it?!?!  I guess no one really ever knows.  I am just going to put my heart into everything I do and what ever happens was just meant to be!
