My eyes are fighting sleep as I write this for you my pen skims across the paper it's not capable of capturing any of this  I'm transparent as glass when I'm with you pleas don't shatter me don't disappoint me  Just cast your shadow on the walls and I'll speak to it I cannot bear to meet your eyes they penetrate me they permeate my skin  you have unimaginable power over me  All I want is for you to stay here with me don't disappear into the night the way you always seem to  please tell me the truth What is it you want?? yet you speak your own language and I can't understand  Yes, I'm transparent as glass when I'm with you but don't make assumptions don't take me for granted  Just breathe in the night air  listen to the wind speak  and sty here with me.
