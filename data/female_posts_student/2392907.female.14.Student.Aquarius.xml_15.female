"Kinkayston," replies Adam, feeling stupid as he says the strange name. "Really?" says Red Top, rather intrugued by the name. "I'm from Kent." "Oh really," murmurs Adam, not the slightest bit interested.  "Yes. I had to travel about two hours to get here you know, because my dad took the Mercedes and I had to get the train." "Oh." Red Top finally shuts up to emit a high pitched giggle. Adam cannot figure out why she is giggling. "But you know, Mike's my brother, so I thought I just had to come. I didn't think he had so many friends though. I mean, how do you know him?" "Ermm," says Adam slowly.  Who the hell is Mike?  "He's really a friend of a friend, really." "Oh I see. Would you like me to introduce him?" "No, it's alright, really, I've been introduced already, I think." "Oh OK." Adam sits there with his drink, not saying anything. Another girl comes over and whispers something in Red Top's ear.  "Oh my god. Really? I have to know all about this!" Red Top exclaims and says to Adam, "Sorry, I have to go now. Maybe I'll see you soon. Can I get your num -" She gets yanked away into the crowded by her friend.
