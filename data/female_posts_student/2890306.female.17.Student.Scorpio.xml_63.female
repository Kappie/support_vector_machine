Since I am related to most of the people that will be there, I am forced to join in the festivities. Joyful. I am now requesting an odd, but flavorful favor of you. If you do so wish, please leave me a voice mail message on my phone during the 3 days I am gone. I would like to listen to something other than my family once in a while. So yes,  do that .   Tonight I went to  Get Smart  at   la escuela de Roosevelt  , and it was lovely funny! I was delighted at how darling Geoffrey looked on stage in his "grey" hair. Also, Heidi and Ebony looked drop-dead  sexy  in their costumes! Don't you just love the 60s era? The clothes were simply  tres bon chic ! *nods* Afterwards, we all proceeded to Perkins for a bite. I find it fascinating that though we give restaurants good business when we go out, they never fail to yell at us for being their customers. *shakes head* Sure, we laugh loud sometimes, but since when is that prohibited?    *begin dream sequence*         Host : "Hello there, group of teenagers! Welcome to Perkins!"     Group of Teenagers : "Hello, host!" *laugh*     Host : "I'm assuming we can seat you in the smoking, non-laughing section, correct?"     Group of Teenagers : "Yes of course! And please give us the curtest, rudest waitress you have!"     Host : "I had her ready when I saw you walking in. Right this way, please."        *end dream sequence*    Yeah, that's basically how it went down. Don't forget to leave me a message, dear darling. I would love you a great big much if you did.   *hands you a  Twinkie *
