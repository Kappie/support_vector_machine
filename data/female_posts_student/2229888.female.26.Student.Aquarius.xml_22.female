I would like to stay passed out like a lump on a log until this whole thing passes! It's driving me crazy! But enough of that . . . let's move on . . .  I have come to an important decision. Those of you who've kept up with my journal, know how I am... I try to give everyone a chance ... I have decided to stop doing that and be picky for a change. You know why??? Cause I am getting no where on the dating field, and I am tired of dating idiots . . .Not that everyone I've dated is and idiot! If you are reading this and you dated me. I'm not talking about you! LOL  I think I naturally date guys who are wayyyyyy too possesive. I went on one date with a certain guy and he informed me that he did not want me to date other people . . . that's scary . . . yikes.  Anyway, other than the above bits of news, nothing really exciting is going on. Mom and Dad broke up, but Dad still lives here and has his own room. If you know anything about my life, you know why this news is not exciting. If you don't, then you are probably thinking I am a wacko LOL i'll let you in on some news I am a wacko ;)
