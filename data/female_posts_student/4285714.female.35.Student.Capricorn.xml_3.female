Nope, he still hasn't spoke a single word to me and actually I'm quite tired of this stupid little game that he's playing. While still young......I'm too damn old for this shit!  Later in the evening, after a few hours of his standing at the truck drinking multiple beers I ask my daughter to go out and ask him to go to the store for me. (remember he is keeper of the money now as he has cut me off from the bank account, or have I not mentioned that part yet? ) He says, "okay" but then gets in his truck, starts it up and SITS there and falls asleep until almost 12:30 a.m and then comes in and goes to bed. WTH??  Shockingly or NOT shockingly he has to go to work this morning, he doesn't work weekends. hmmmmmm? I'm NOT wasting my time calling to see if he is there, screw that!  I'm trying to keep my spirits up and not let him get to me, and I think I'm doing a pretty good job of it right now (or not, who the hell knows) but Damn this is absolutely ridiculous!!  To make matters worse..and I really hate talking badly about my sister, but I kind of have to in order for you to get the whole picture. I love my sister, she is 2 years older than me and has lived in Wisconsin for the last 16 years or so but she has always been very competitive when it comes to me and my "men". Ever since we were in High school, if I had a boyfriend then SHE  always  took a liking to him and wanted him for herself and usually once I and that boyfriend broke up she was quick on his heels and the guys seemed to think it was a great way to get back at me or make me jealous or whatever! Typical male attitude. In fact..........when I broke up with  a boyfriend named "Richard", she was all over him and even moved in with him but she ended up marrying and moving to Wisconsin with HIS roomamte! Great values huh? Even when I married "C", my sister came in town and while I was gone on my honeymoon and she was staying in my home, driving my car and keeping my children and hers, she spent ALL of her time in town with my EX husband, hanging out with him, going out to eat with him, talking to him about why our marriage failed and the fact that he wanted me back and was inconsolable because I had just got remarried and "god only knows what else they did" etc, etc,  etc.......So I have always been leary of her intentions, and I do tend to keep my guard up when it comes to her because of our past. My motto has always been "if you CAN take my man.....you can HAVE him". (because if he's takable , then I don't want him anyway. Kinda cold I know but it works for me.  Okay so I'm getting off track here.. My sister came down in July of this year after "C" came home and all I heard from her the whole time she was here is how great "C" is and how lucky I am to have this wonderful guy AND what a great body he has. She doesn't know the whole story. Not that I don't agree that he is a great guy at times (even most of the time until now) but there is another side to him as well that she has no clue about.  So....I called my sister yesterday because I have only heard from her once or twice since her visit a month and a half ago and that is unusual, we usually speak 3-4 times a week at the very least. We talked for a few minutes and she told me she hasn't talked to me because she has felt "uncomfortable", of course I ask "about what" and she tells me that "C" came on to her while she was here and didn't know whether she should tell me or not. WHAT???? What kind of sister are you anyway? I would tell her IMMEDIATELY if her hubby came on to me or I even  thought  that he had. She said "C" came into where she was sleeping on the morning that she was to leave (on his way out to work) to say goodbye and gave her a hug and was, in her words "extremely friendly". I asked her if there was any way that she could have misconstrued his behavior and she said "absolutely not". SO now I am thinking "is this her vivid imagination getting away with her because of her long time jealousy with me and my "men" (Hey! I HATE it for her that I am better looking than her and was always the first choice with the guys...a little ego there huh?) or is she trying to make me believe that "she won" this time because my guy came on to her?.... OR did "C" actually make a move on her while she was here?.....I just don't know and this was the last thing that I needed to hear right now. SO now I am PISSED, actually beyond pissed and could care less if "C" ever talks to me again. So torn between loved ones.  Anonymous, I think you are right when you say it seems that I am feeling better because I am able to vent some toxic frustration here cause I certainly haven't discusssed this with anyone else and it is eating me up inside and I DO feel much better after I get on here and rant about it awhile.  I woke up "this morning" and totally freaked out because my clock said 3 PM!!! I know I have been stressing and not gettting enough sleep but I haven't slept that late since I was a teenager AND I have a 12 year old in the house who doesn't need to or deserve to be alone all day. Thank GOD  what had happened is that the power had went out at some point in the night and it was only 10 am. Whoo!  I'm really letting all of this get to me too much. I tell myself that it's normal to be feeling these mixed emotions but I still don't like this shit!  Okay...now I am just babbling about nothing really, I need to get off of here for now. I look forward to any responses or even beatings about the head and shoulders from y'all. I could really use some input. Am I over reacting or do I have good reason to be feeling what I am feeling. Am I allowing this to get out of hand or do I really have no control, which is how I feel. Actually I feel trapped because of my non-working idiot self and not having the immediate ability to get the hell out of dodge. I NEED to finish my degree if I want to provide comfortably for my children and myself and not struggle from paycheck to paycheck. And why the HELL should I lose MY home when he is the one who is doing this shit?  What I really want to do is just take off completely, go somehwere, anywhere just to get away for awhile. My oldest daughter keeps her weekends pretty well planned with work and studying and her boyfriend and I don't have to keep her under my thumb at all times but my 12 year old needs her mom. Next weekend she is supposed to go to her dad's for the weekend so I am thinking seriously about just packing a bag and making a road trip......somewhere, not sure where quit yet but just getting away, maybe having a sleepover with a girlfriend or something without telling "C" what I am doing and let him worry about me and what I am doing for a change, make him think that I am the one having an affair, I'm actually even thinking about hitting a few bars, like he has been doing, I don't have a problem turning heads. I'm not sure that he would really care though at this point and then I wonder to myself if I am just acting as immature as him by having these thoughts.  Oh well........................it's a beautiful day and there are things to do and people to see.....not really but it sounds good right? I'm off to find something to do with this day.  By the way....I'm STILL.....HORNY  and  LONELY and Oh yeah! I'm still married too and it still sucks!! :o) I just want all of this to come to an end...some way....somehow! And NO!!! I'm NOT at all suicidal so don't let that cross your mind, I have too much to live for.   If you made it this far.....Thanks for listening! :o) Dawn
