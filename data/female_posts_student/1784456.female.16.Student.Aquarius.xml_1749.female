(Dado rail does a good enough job anyway :P) Ahh I'm in a weird mood, soory peeps! Listening to Lou Reed - Take a Walk on the Wild Side. Yup, it'll make you go crazy, as if you weren't crazy enough anyway! Actually, do you recon there are more people with mental illnesses now? Hmm... interesting... *If you're interested in that type of thing* Which obviously everyone is! Oh dear, gone into Reef listening mode. It's down hill from here folks... right downstairs and to the fridge to find dessert I'm afraid. *desert dessert?* Oh my god! There's a whole desert in my fridge! That explains why everything tastes funny... Well Tesco were trying to kill us by selling off potato salad. :D Hehe, I don't really believe everyone's trying to kill me, it's just what the voices tell me.
