I was just thinking about the stupidest idea I had heard in a long time. Of course comming from Brendan, you would think I would know better than to listen. A purse that has a zipper on both sides so when you loose things in the bottom you just turn it over and open the other side? Hello, things are on the bottom because they are heavy and if you flip the purse over they will fall to the bottom again. Really Brendan, we are glad that you are listening to our concerns but I expect more from you. What happened to the guy who had to hear a name 157 times before he remembered? I think living up at MIT has done something to you. Now going to Arizona. You better find a better girlfriend than Adam to put sunscreen on you. I know he has soft hands but he can't be with you all the time. Maybe that should be the next poll. Who should be subjected to the torture of putting sunscreen on Brendan's back?
