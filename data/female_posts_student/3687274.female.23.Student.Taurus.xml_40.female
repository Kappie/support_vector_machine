I was saying if I averaged 125, but came home once or twice with more than 125, oh say, about 150, or less than 125, oh perhaps 100, I'd still manage to break even if I stayed above 100!! 125 times the 4, four, IV, 1+1+1+1 = 4 weeks in a month is 500.  100 times the 4 weeks in a month equals 400.  400 does not, will not, won't fucking ever, !!Tammy!!, equal 500.   fucktard!!
