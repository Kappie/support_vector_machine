It was kinda hectic with lots of stuff going on and unfort. i rode my bike in since none of my closer co-employees that drive were working. Worked w/ Josh for most of the day. He's a pretty cool guy besides the fact that he smokes and isnt going to college like he should next year [[although he says he will eventually..]] He's one of the 3 guy cashiers, the other 2 being Tom [old] and blake who also lifeguards so hardly ever cashiers. Oh and then managers occasionally cashier. Left work around 7 15 and went home and ate my 2nd dinner.  Then Brad and Brittney came by and picked me up and we headed over to Caitlin's to hang out. I haven't seen britt since the middle of june and brad in like..a week? So yeah obviously being deprived. *lol* Matt and lee along with peter K. and two random guys from other schools came over to the pool w/ us and were being sketchy. BOO ON DRUGS! But yeah so we abandoned that and went to GOODBERRY'S! With the nerdy guy checking out caitlin and brittney and watching some guys skateboard + woohoo for the hotness of the convertible. Watched some real world...home by 12!  Yesterday i worked again but it was really fun! YAYNESSITY! I swam laps in the morning for about 30 or 40 minutes then worked until about 5 30 [[alli came in around 2 so we got to hang out and Robert was being semi talkative for once]] then Clint asked me to be his rescue dummy in his lifeguarding class so i did that for 2 hours! *haha* It takes a lot of energy to drown! But yeah it was really fun minus the fact that towards the end it was freezing getting strapped onto the board + i have a massive amount of hair that velcro REALLY likes! However...*supposedly* clint will take me out to a dinner and movie for it! *haha* He was like..just pick a movie and we'll go when you get back. I doubt it'll happen i just think it's silly. Clint's a great guy tho, just fun to be around [[alli made sure to remind me that he's 19 and yes..thats fine, its not like that w/ us]]  Then CHRISTEENY came over! And helped me pack! And we hung out [+ HUGGED! haha good times] Went to bed after talking to McCall for a bit--i was EXHAUSTED. Woke up this morning and hand some extra time before i leave for the BEACH!!!!
