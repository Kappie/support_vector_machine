What did you find there,  Did you stand a while and stare,  Did you meet anyone?    I've seen butterflies galore,  I've seen people big and small,  I've still not found what I'm looking for.  We're all looking for someone.    Captain Scott, you were so bold,  Now you're looking rather cold,  Out there in the snow.I've seen polar bears and seals,  I've seen giant antarctic eels,  I've still not found what I'm looking for.    Columbus, where are you bound,  So you think the world is round,  Sail off in the blue.  There are Indians by the score,  In many places that I saw,  I've still not found what I'm looking for.    We're all looking for someone.
