(Luke 9:62)         Many people who are willing to follow Jesus nonetheless worry about future uncertainties, hence their faltering footsteps and mindless fellowship. Jesus does not change His tone in spite of their lack of security; in contrast, He emphasizes that He is not one who is too concerned with personal security. He says, 'Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.'     Jesus wants us to understnad that to be overly worried about everything is not beneficial to anyone at all, since this readily weakens the fervour of devotion to life. That is why He syas, 'No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.' Jesus also says, 'Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day ahs enought trouble of its own.'    Following the Lord requires courage, perseverance and trust in Him. when you are certain about the will of God, be not afraid; rather ,just follow Him one step at a time, work hard to go forward, and sucess shal never elude you.    DAMN..tht was freaking inspiring..actually it was sort of like the answer to a question I didn't ask but was sort of in my sub concious...well that whoel thing up there was sort of like one of those things that GOD purposely sent for me....But still heres the problem:  - I really don't have enuf faith at all to sometimes beleive that God sent me that for  me - I am too proud to admit to who I really like or to even stick up for things I know   that I as a Catholic have to defend - I have a SHITTY temper - I am a little bit insecure although people think I am so confident  - I am too secretive to really appreciate what real friendship can do for me - I am too realistic to really think outisde the box and have trust in GOD..  man the list goes on...but I PROMISE I will try to have more faith...cuz at the end of the day..thats all really got...  [faith]
