Me and Kaiah and Brian played the African version of checkers and stick ball for the entire time. Brian always won, 'cause when you weren't looking he'd change all the pieces. Show off. Stick ball was a ball, I'm so bad at it. It was pathetic watching me try. But it was fun anyway. Brian was pitcher every time 'cause he was the only one who could pitch worth anything. I think I hit the ball a grand totall of three times in the hundred times I attempted in bettween groups of kids. Then Brian hit the ball on the roof, so Sue told him to climb up and get it but, "don't let any one see you do it, or I'll be busted." So he climbes up and saunters accross the roof, in full view. Sue was like, "why don't you just hang a neon sign up there? Didn't any one ever teach you to sneak?!" It was funny.   I ate homemade peanut butter and a tiny little piece of mango (pray to God that I don't have an alergic reaction). Good stuff. Haven't eten mango in soooo long. Love the stuff. Talked about movies and music. Brian was shocked that I thought Scary Movie was retarded and that country music isfrom the devil (I didn't quite put it like that... hehe). So he's gonna bring his cd player tomorrow to convert me. hahaha. Nice try.An we arm wrestled, Brian beat me, and we played mercy, I beat Kaiah, and we played drums and clapping rhythm stuff. Fun fun fun. Tomorrow we go swimming. And I really need a new bathing suit too.....  Signing off - Simply Jak
