Cast and crew list, as well as meeting minutes will be posted there to keep the whole class abreast of things. So please check regularly.   2) Exhibition people can make use of the noticeboard to post announcements, etc. It is not solely just for the production only.   3) The electives next week will clash with the first 1/2 an hour ofour consultation/rehearsal time. or maybe even the whole hour. Please check the noticeboard for rehearsal time updates.   Continue to work hard so that we can pull of a good show and exhibition! Everyone's doing a good job. Try not to worry about the SIA marks, I have great faith that Miss Ng will help us with that as long as we fulfil our responsibilities and keep a record of it.   Working with the class has been a satisfying experience, for me at least, despite all the hiccups and *ahem* a few people who have not been putting much effort into this project. I've learnt to be a better listener (at least I hope so) where the directing of the production is concern, I'm still trying to be as firm and decisive as Veronica ^_^ I'm very thankful for all those who have taken the initiative to make this production work and I hope you guys don't feel any resentment towards this project, and even if you do, we'll still have to stick it through and carry on with it. Just try to enjoy yourself, okay? And remember to post reflections!
