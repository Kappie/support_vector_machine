Tests, projects, quizzes, and more tests.  Yesterday my Cubism project was due, and I had my US History final.  Then there were editorship interviews...  Well that's done.  I made it home by 3 for the NTRB phone interview, and that one went pretty well I think.  Then I drove Jenny some advil and crashed, waking up bright and early at 6:30 to make my way to Escondido.  Well, MapQuest, you've fucked me over before.  So after deciding that staying on the I-5 wasn't the way to get to the 78-E, it directed me to San Marcos Blvd.  After about 20 minutes looking for that, I called home, and found that I was gonna have to get myself back on the I-5 and drive down most of the 78 before I got to Escondido High.  Well...I got there on time, but I was damn nervous.  Took the Writing test and got the hell out of there.  Now I'm home, thinking about how I might spend the rest of this weekend.  Parents are leaving Monday morning for Italy...oh, but alas, APs.  I love you all!
