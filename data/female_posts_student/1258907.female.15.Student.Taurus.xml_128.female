If I were to run, would you see I wasnt there? I dont think you would notice The absence of someone so little as me I dont think you would notice I ran from the falling debris The falling debris you left on my life The falling debris that brought all the strife If I were to cry, would you stay by my side? If I were to die, would you feel the pain inside? If I were to stop, would you slow down? If I were to ask for help, would you make any sound? I dont think you'd notice The absence of someone so little as me I dont think you would notice I left so I could be free Be free from the world I've come to live Free from the world where people wont forgive If I were to die, would you write my obituary? Would you stop and wonder, if i were institutionary? If I were to leave, would you see me go? If I were to scream, would you even know? If I were to move, would you even care? If I were to run, would you see I wasnt there? I dont think so Beecause I am gone, and you dont care.
