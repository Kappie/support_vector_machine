Sometimes she's a TERRIBLE actress, and she can't speak english very well, (obviously, with her accent and everything), yet she stars in many english movies. and chinese movies..but her main language is taiwanese.duH..so when she speaks cantonese..it sounds funnie. I believe that the only reason why she IS in the movie business is because of her looks...   urlLink       ...why is she so PRETTY? I wish I could be as pretty as her=(
