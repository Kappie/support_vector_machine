I think we should call it something else than Man BOOBIES, though...becuase we only get the hot guys to flash us none of those fat ugly gross men that really have man boobies. We can't call it man tits..ugh. I dunno...we'll have to brainstorm.It's kind of like a guys gone wild thing...Sometimes we have to explain that by saying that we want the guys to "flash" us, we mean we want to see their pecs...not their  family jewels ...guys seem to be confused by that. Some nights it's a total let-down though...I don't understand why some guys don't...you can walk around without your shirt on, but when you have a shirt on, it's hard for you to give a peak to some girls? And it's not like we're not hott enough...me and ren are pretty damn hott..haha. hmmm ok...but geeez! it's so frustrating sometimes!  Last night I think we got the best flash of our lives. It was at a gas station and WOW. Nice body.  VERY  nice. I had dreams about him last night. Wherever you are...I think I'm in LIKE with your body....  I thought this was funny from the other night...  Lauren: "I only want you from the waist up." David : " WHATTT?!?!?" Lauren:"Some girls just don't want the penis, David."  hahaha.
