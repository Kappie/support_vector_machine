Then she dropped another paper on us, The Great Gatsby Final.... Hmm, what should I write on? The signifigance of the green light? Gatsby's desire to relive his past? So many choices!  I also have Health and Economics homework.   Well, I'm trying to decide whether or not today was good. Gosh, I woke up to early, my cat threw-up, I couldn't find anything decent to wear, and the list goes on and on.   It seems like all I do is complain. Which is wierd because I don't complain very much, usually. Or at least I think I don't.   Oh, my parent's just got home. Got to go feed Taffy!
