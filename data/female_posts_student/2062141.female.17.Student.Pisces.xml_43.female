He has the kind of humor that if you don't get, you hate it.... but if you do you love it. I love it. And Mary Steenberger from Back to the Future 3 (Clara Clayton) was in it, and so was Mr. Grant from the Mary Tyler Moore Show... i loved that show... and of course Bob Newhart. I was veteren of watching Nick at Nite when I was little, back when they showed great shows like I Love Lucy and Wonder Years... now they show the Cosby Show and Three's Company (???). Ah well. Today my mom and I went Christmas shopping at Southcenter (suicide, i know) and I got a cd for my dad, body scrub and earrings for my sister, and a really long pretty red coat for me.. (hey, I needed a coat!). It makes me happy. Yay red coat. And blue tights. Exxxcellent. I am the sexybeastiest.  Haha... just KIDDING.        I watched West Side Story last night... I love that movie. It's the most beautiful movie ever. Everyone's so sweaty though. All the dancing and fighting. Lol. Next week after my art class downtown I'm gonna go see the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (by same guys who did West Side Story) which is the most awesome twisted musical ever. It's about this insane barber who slits his client's throats and grinds their bodies into meat and sells it to the unsuspecting townspeople... BWAhahaha. So awesome. I forget what else happens, I haven't seen it since freshmen year when Mr. Buckley brought it in for us to watch (which I realize now had no educational value, he just wanted to show us, he loved musicals). I wonder how the big house is treating Buckley. Just in case you didn't know, Mr. Buckley had a 17 year old girlfriend and he allegedly molested her little sister and now he's in prison...    ...but he was the most awesome teacher ever! Really! All I have to say is, never drop the soap.
