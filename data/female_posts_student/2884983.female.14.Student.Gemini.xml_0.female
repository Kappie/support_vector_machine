I am not going to go with them because I am tired. even though I went to bed a 10 last night, he he he. well...Illenips I dont think you should quit soccer altogether. just tell them how mad you are at them. or go find that other team that you couldve joined. but dont quit soccer just becasue some people are stupid ass's. well. I hope all goes well. goddess bless
