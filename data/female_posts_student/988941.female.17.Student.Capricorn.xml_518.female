Then, when I came out of a shop, it was beautifully sunny again! Fortunately my friend and I avoided all the rain, because we decided to get a bus back to Victoria instead of the tube, cos we couldn't acutlly find a tube station and we didn't fancy getting wet! The bus was quite odd, we got a seat so it was the first time we'd sat down all day, and it was some dodgy old bus that took us practically half way round london on it's way to victoria, but at least we got to see some nice places, lol!  Today the weather is beautifully sunny again (although it's quite windy), which  is a damn good job too, cos I'm going to be out and about again today! The only problem is the wind, so I'll have to go and do a wind test with my clothes- put on one outfit, stand in the garden for five minutes and see how cold I get, then change to the next outfit and so on until I get a combination that I'm happy and warm in, lol! Anyone else have any strange methods of deciding what to wear?  Anyway, must go because my hair is an absolute mess and I've got to deal with it pronto! Have fun at the park (whoever's going!) and I'll probbaly talk to some of you lot later! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
