Apparently he has been spending his time gardening, reading, and writing poems, one of which is about George Bush. The article also mentions that he has developed a love for American cookies and muffins, and even that he consumes 1,300 calories during his breakfast meal. This appears to be a public interest article rather than one published to inform. I found this very interesting considering how many serious articles the newspapers have written concerning Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Despite the fact that the newspapers have portrayed him in the past as an evil dictator, they appear to be writing about him in an almost sympathizing light, which I find to be quite unusual.
