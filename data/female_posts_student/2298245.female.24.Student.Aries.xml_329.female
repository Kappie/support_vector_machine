I spent the weekend when I wasn't busy talking to my family or hanging out with them, or doing nothing, taking that oh-so-often trip down the road of regret.  What would have happened if I'd only [fill in the blank].  Lately I've been beating myself up over staying in New York, because every time I go home I realize how much I miss my family and my home and I don't want to come back.  But come back I do, because I must, because I made a rather silly decision to come here in the first place and a rather hasty decision to remain here when I had other options.  Now I'm stuck with my choices.  And I regret that I made them, as those of us who are prone to self-doubt often do.  But then I start to think what would life be like if I'd never moved here to begin with.  I certainly wouldn't realize that home is where I want to be if I'd never left it.  And I wouldn't have met someone I consider to be my very best friend.  And if I hadn't stayed here, I wouldn't have met all the wonderful people I've met in law school, or gotten to better know a previous acquaintance, a person who I cherish now for her kindness and friendship and support.  So all in all I'd say that there is, at least, a silver lining.  And considering that all of these experiences have largely made me who I am today, and that I like that person, even though she's hard to find sometimes, I think that I have made the right decisions.  Except that now, should I choose to move somewhere closer to home, it could prove very difficult for me, since most people who graduate from this law school stay relatively close to this area, and certainly very few end up working in the South.  At the same time I feel I must go home.  I am feeling drawn toward there.  My sister is going to be getting married relatively soon (perhaps in a little over a year), and will probably be starting a family not too long after that, and I would like to be close enough so that I can be a presence in my sister's children's lives.  I want them to know me and love me; I want to be the cool aunt who gets to have fun with them and then send them home to their mother when they start to get on my nerves.  I do not want to see them only once or twice a year.  I also feel a great sense of peace whenever I go home, no matter how much stress I may be otherwise under, something I never feel up here even when I have no stress at all.  And I long for that feeling to return.  I just fit so much better there, something I never would have known had I not left.  But returning will not be easy.  It will probably not be easy to find a job.  But I have to do it and so it will get done.  I trust that if it is where I am supposed to be, and I really feel that it is, that all will work out for the best in the end.  So on I toil.  I promise more lively and interesting and un-personal posts will follow in the coming days.  As well as complaints about studying for exams I am sure.
