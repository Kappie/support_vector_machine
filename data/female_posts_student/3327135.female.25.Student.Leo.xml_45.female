Maybe I should change the title of this posting! Oh, but who cares? :P  Flora's series TGUIT episode 10-12 is due to be here this afternoon. I will call the videoshop in a while to reserve a copy for me after posting this.   Really cannot wait any longer to see how the story develops into now!!! Hehehe... I will go and get it and watch it as soon as possible.
