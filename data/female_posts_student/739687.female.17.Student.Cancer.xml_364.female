Not sure how good it is:   Alone in a velvet breeze, Softly, sweetly stroking my veins Warm with vital serenity- Slowly suppressed by chills-  Your fingers grazed my arms In laconic, lethargic, emotionless spirals Chills danced from your palms And lingered through my body-  I watched in silence As storms brewed anxiously in a distance Far away I saw the suffering- Those hopeful dreams clouded in thunderous confusion  And I glanced at you Though never quite looked over my shoulder- Just the knowledge of your presence Painted a picture my eyes studied in the dark  Carefully I memorized lines across you Lines I knew far too well I knew, for tonight, no words would utter But in my mind I fashioned my thoughts into letters-  ‘I watch you my love -my hate- My disposition, remorse, regret- Your careless disregard for me Ensues a desire – a lack of desire – To spend one more minute in your arms For tonight I silence myself And for times ahead, I predict the same You my love –my hate- My weakness, unhealthy desire- My carcinogenic habit –I don’t smoke- But I breathe you in –into my veins- For another night Of an addiction I will not kick So instead, I silence myself...to you My lovely antagonist’  Hours pass in silence Anticipant of storm clouds Easing slowly into this uncomfortable quiet Soon I will make my retreat  In a short time I will feel the comfort of loneliness -The relief of your absence- But the moments remaining of my stay Will undoubtedly be the loneliest of all.
