Made a mistake todae...for e past two daez....i tot SHE was going to csco 2dae...but it turned out dat 2dae dun haf practice...( dat explains it...i din feel alot...[meaning there's not much emotion thingy...] abt it...hmmz...can dat b called 'instinct'?) so...now wat? Haf to wait for another wk to noe lorz...but i reali dun wish her to join there...so sadz... u noe? i tried to put some distance between HER and me, ( but failed lar...ar bor we wunt b dat close together....i'm such a failure rite?) but she keep on showing me concern...bth arz!!!!!!!! Simply irresistable. Well...abt her and dat Timpani (dats wat u all call him rite?)...although my instinct TOLD me dat she likes him...now it no longer tells me e same thing...mayb dat was juz a crush on him... but even so...i chose to believe HER lorz...since she told me dat she doesn't like him...i guess...she wunt lie to me rite? after all... she has no meaning of hurting me...rite?  Gurl ar gurl...if its time to let go...u must let go...u alwaez tell others to look at things on e bright side...but can't u do e same? i can't. Cos my world is in sphere-shaped.
