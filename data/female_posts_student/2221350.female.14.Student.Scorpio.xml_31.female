All the entries are old and the poor blog's been abandonded but you should read the stuff that's there anyway, it's creepy and it makes me wonder what happened to her.  I saw you standing in the corner On the edge of a buring light I saw you standing in the corner Come to me again in the cold cold night  In the cold cold night  You make me feel a little older Like a full grown women might. But when you gonna grow colder  Come to me again in the cold cold night In the cold cold night  I hear you walkinÂ by my front door I hear the creakinÂ of the kitchen floor I donÂt care what other people say IÂm gonna love you anyway  Come to me again in the cold cold night In the cold cold night  I canÂt stand it any longer I need the fuel to make my fire bight So donÂt fight it any longer  Come to me again in the cold cold night In the cold cold night  And I know that you feel it too When my skin turns into glue You will know that itÂs warm inside And youÂll come run to me  In the cold cold night In the cold cold night In the cold cold night In the cold cold night
