I guess all this pressure is just building, and it is hard to handle right now.  B.J. is a good child, my parents golden child basically. He has followed everything they have ever taught him. In a few months he is going on his mission. Golden child. I don't really resent him, in fact I look up to him a lot, but I don't appreciate the way my parents want the rest of us to turn out as good as he did. Whatever. I'm gonna do things my way. Always have, always will.  Cassidy has rebelled against everything my parents have ever taught us. She has really hurt my parents, and me for that matter. She really resents my brother, and that ticks me off. She verbally abuses my younger sister, and me when i talk to her. She is not all bad, horrible-ness, but she has sent my family into turmoil many times. Right now she has us all walking on eggshells so that we don't set her off, AND THAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF!! Why the hell should we all be on edge just because she has a ****ing anger problem? I'm so sick of her attitude running this house. One more year and she's off to college.  Then there is me. I feel that because cassidy refuses to help around the house, my parents expect me to pick up the slack; watching the kids, cleaning, etc. I also have this lingering feeling that because their first daughter has rebelled so much, especially against our church, that they expect me to be their perfect daughter. I don't like this at all, because I am not one to conform to anything. I have my own way of doing things, my own thought patterns, my own style, everything, and I'm not gonna change just because I don't live up to my parents standards. If my mother wants a prodigy she has two other daughters she can try and mold.
