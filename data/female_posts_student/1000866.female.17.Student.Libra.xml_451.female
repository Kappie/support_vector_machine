So, yeah...Bryan asked me out. :) I was like, "come on, tell me, it can't be better than what you told me yesterday." I guess I was wrong...in a VERY good way.  YAY! Amazing day. I'm seriously so happy right now. I got inside my house after he dropped me off and I was like...jumping up and down I was so happy. :) I was hoping he would so much.   Ah, and now I have to go...more later maybe...
