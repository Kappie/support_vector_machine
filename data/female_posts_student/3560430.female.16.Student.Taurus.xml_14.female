I have let's see thirty dollars already put away for this writers conferance in Surrey, so I need... 400-30... let's see... 370 more dollars. That's a lot. I make most of my money on bottles and cans. Don't knock it I got $67 and something cents today! Any how I'll probably be able to get about 200 by October. My parents (dad) say that they may be able to throw money my way if they get a couple of students to live in our basement, but I can't count on that. So I have decided that I'm going to get people at my parents bussiness to give me their bottles, if I can. I've got to start working out again so maybe my smiling face will encorage people.   Another method of cash grabbing I may try is posting a baby sitting sign at the school (Kung Fu School), that may bring in some revenue... I want to get more but Agg... it's so hard not to spend. I believe that I may be able to manage though. The only things I have to spend money on is father's day and Ravens b-day, that's about thirty five dollars, anything else goes towards Surrey. That sounds really bad. What ever. Ya. I think I know what I'll get daddy though and it may not cost all of what I think it will. Ok that and the fact I'm going to calgary so all my change goes to that, that's a considerable amount. I'll see if I can squeegy the $15 for Raven's birthday from my parents... I don't know what else but I'm pretty sure if I talk to a couple of people I will be able to do it.
