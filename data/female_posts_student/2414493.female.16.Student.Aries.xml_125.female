The first three first violins weren't here tonight, so I somehow ended up sitting first stand, second chair. At one point, I thought I heard Sean mutter something about "no leadership." I fear Sean. I always think he's going to say something bad about me, as I've heard him put down other people. And then there was this new part in the Shostakovich which was pizz, but I played arco and sounded like a proper fool. I don't know what it is about music and inferiority, but I've never felt comfortable with it. It's not something I can flaunt. I cower constantly in the shadow of more talented, more confident people.  Things to do tonight (as of 9:48pm): make brownies for earth club meeting, do Spanish APG work, study for math test, finish Hemingway reading and questions. I probably shouldn't have spent three hours on Bailey, but at least I started notecards again and I'm on chapter 40.  Being the masochist I am, I still wish I had strings pressing into my fingertips. I was really stupid tonight. I would've laughed at myself if I'd seen my performance.
