Another day has come and gone, but I know there will be others, if it's meant to be, it will be and if it's not, you'll always be a part of me, you are so near and dear to my heart, I can't go one day without thinking about you, sometimes i laugh about all the times we've had,  and sometimes I cry knowing I've lost them, but most of all I just smile, knowing I was yours for amoment in time, and will be another day.....  Mel,  Why can't I do this alone? When will I be able to forget? I have to stop this but it's so hard, I miss him with all my heart!  Ran
