So I did a little investigation (taking a little break from studying), and I find out that he was none other than the man who killed Jesse James.  I found  urlLink what appears to be a review of a book about this event , and I find the last paragraph particularly compelling, where he contrasts Jesse James and Robert Ford as representative of the two different centuries while living on the cusp, though I do not know enough about the specific history of these two men to champion its validity.    It did get me thinking about something which is a nice segue into something else I wanted to do, which is make a movie recommendation:   urlLink Once Upon a Time in the West .  Yes it's long, and yes it's dubbed, but this is an wonderful, monstrous epic film about the death of the old West and the rise of the Modern era, symbolized by the coming of the railroads and the capitalists.  And if this doesn't exactly do it for you, it's got Henry Fonda, one of the nicest looking men ever to grace the face of the earth, looking quite rugged and quite evil staring out of those steely blue eyes.  Oh yes, and one more thing:  make sure you see it Widescreen, or else you'll miss the best thing about the film, which is it's style and beauty.  They say looks aren't everything, but I think with film, looks are almost everything.  If a film looks good, so much else can be forgiven.  And this film looks great.  It's very nearly perfect.  And it just  urlLink came out on DVD , so there are no excuses.
