Next thing i know a man is sitting next to me, talking about life and marriage and such and its like 845pm. I got there like at 530pm. So it turns out he lives in my complex, the thing is I think I told him which apt. I'm in and now I'm scared. I didn't in any way feel threatned but I acted so irresponsibly. I never even go to bars by myself, much less talk to some stranger. So all night I kept thinking to myself he's gonna knock at my door and I'm gonna freak. Not to mention, I'm so freakin' paranoid about everything, and that just escalated it. So now I feel like shit, I look like shit. So then I get to sleep like at 12am, and wake wide awake at 230am and stay awake until 5am. I'm freakin' out majorly. I called him last night too, and he was getting a fitting for his uniforms, small talk for like 3 mins. but that was it. I know, I'm not gonna call him anymore. Nothing much happened with his mom at lunch, I stayed away from bringing him up but she volunteered some info on what he did yesterday and such but nothing enlightening. I swear I'm gonna need anti-depressents soon cause I don't feel like myself at all anymore. I feel like I'm invisible and I feel downright scared.
