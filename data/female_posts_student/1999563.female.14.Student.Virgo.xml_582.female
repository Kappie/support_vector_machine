It seems like I could be here forever  Here, under a towering tree Never tire of your breeze. Never tire of your adventures  Because its Summer. Everday to make the best of. Everyday filled with your love.  I have never felt this way. I feel like I can fly. I feel as if your sun is calling to me.  It slowly speaks to me Telling me to run. Telling me to jump.   Because everyday  Is fresh It is clean  Under the sun...
