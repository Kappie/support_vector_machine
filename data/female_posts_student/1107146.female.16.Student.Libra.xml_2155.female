Does anyone know when the terms quiz is? It's not on monday, is it?  That would be REALLY bad.  Also, has anyone started on their research paper?  I've got a little research done, but I haven't even started writing it.  I hate not having a laptop.    I'm heading to AL tomorrow morning, but I'll be home around 8:00pm or so.  As if anyone will be on here before I get home anyway... my blog is officially "mostly dead."  Poor blog. *sniff*
