Now, take about 40 degrees of heat out of the equation, add the fact that the cell phone was locked IN SIDE the car... which was running of course, stick Lizzie outside a nearly empty LOCKED church... and you have me... yesterday.  Oh i am good... lol, and it won me the title of idiot... but lets all remember... CHAD DID IT FIRST!
