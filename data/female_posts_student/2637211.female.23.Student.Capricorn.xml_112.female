A movie worth seeing, but some really harsh scenes in there. Now I've got to do a ton of reading before tomorrow, and I'm so behind on the long book that we're supposed to read throughout the quarter. I have to read more than a book a week per class. In 10 weeks, it can get a little out of control, and I am way too into reality television. And my eye is totally infected and red and swollen. I can only hope that my thick lenses cover some of the horror of it. So, long story short, I'm pissy, hungry, tired, and misfigured. Who said college was the best time of their life? I'm glad it's only 4 years.
