I just got done watching The Truth About Charlie, which although is a very very good movie, has some rather sloppy, nose squashing kisses. But the thing is... they really seemed to enjoy it... Is it really not that bad to get your nose squashed in the name of love? I dunno. My day hasn't gotten much better. It's actually gotten a lot worse. But you know what?  Can't complain.
