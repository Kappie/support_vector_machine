It gave me a headache, though.  I don't feel like talking anymore.  So, be happy with what Rachel sent me while I was sleeping last night  imnochewtoy: ashleigh for you if I could I would be snow  Auto response from imnochewtoy: please snow  imnochewtoy: haha but you make me melt anyways imnochewtoy: omg I cant beleive I just said that  Rachels so cute :)
