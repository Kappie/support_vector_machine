Do you remember when you were a kid at camp (if you went lol) you would play chubby bunnies? Well if you have never played the game, you shove marshmallows or something soft and squishy in you mouth, and then try to say chubby bunnies. Who ever can shove the most marshmallows into you mouth and still say chubby bunnies, wins. It is a very funny game to play with your friends when you are at camp lol. Just thought I would share this though with the people who might read this.  ~ashley~
