I shared it so that she could be a part of something special. it's an old '63 dodge dart. i love that car!  i gave up the car for a year so it could be put in her name. i needed a car the whole time. i was pregnant with no way to the hospital. no way to work. but the reason for the car wasn't for all that stuff.  it was so kimmie and i could work on it and make it into something special. it was suposed to be a project for she and i. it actually hurt me alot when it seemed to turn into something for her and jerry but i didn't say anything.  it was hard for me to see that relationship between jerry and kimmieu because he'd been so mean, but if he was nice to her what right did i have to interfere?  but thru it all, i KNEW the car was hers and mine, and i knew jerry could never have that because he hadn't been thru what we went thru with that car.  i was pregnant with baby anthony with that car (i rode in it all day having contractions) that car brought us on road trips and drives thru the country, i taught kimmie how to drive it down the road...  it's not the car being gone that hurts. it's the symbol of so many memories. i can see that kimmie would want a nicer looking car than the dodge for her and teddy to drive. that is understandable, but she COULD have taken to the dodge to greenville.  Doesn't jerry go there every other weekend?  is there anyway you could trade back? jerry really loves you and maybe he'd understand you wanting the dodge back... i know you feell ike you owe him alot, but please remeber, although he really likes the car, I LOVE IT...  bryan comes home sunday with enough money that i could give her 500 dollars. That's enough money to put down on a new car. Then i could give her 100 dollars a month until i gave her a thousand.  I hope she considers it.  that way she  and teddy could pick out a car.  i know she probably won't.  she won't want to take something jerry likes so much away from him. that hurts because it's like she doesn't care about my feelings about it.  why doesn't she?  why is jerry suddenly do high and me so low?  i know he's really sweet to her and she thinks of him like a dad, but he's been that way for almost a year...  i might not have always been perfect, but i have always been her sister.  this car means so much to me. i would still share it with her if she would just change her mind.  if she decides against it, i won't understand, but i won't be mad anymore. it's like there's and empty place in my chest, but one day it won't hurt so much, i know.  there is the chance that she is just young and in love and really doesn't understand what she is doing in giving away this car. i really think that is it. there's no way sheu could understand what it means to me, i suppose.  but no matter what she decides, she means more to me than the car, so i am going to try really hard not to hold it against her.  i am going to be honest, it won't be easy... but i love her more than any old car.  i am sorry for my earlier emails to her. i was really mad and told her to never email me again. it's just that it surprised me.  i never thought she'd do this to me.
