I sometimes forget he´s the dean of my law school.  He apparently likes the band outkast and sang a song by Little Jon, the rapper and bobbed his head and everything getting into it.  The wonders never cease.  He also gave us a summary of Rocky and why it is actually a love story, haha.  Very funny man.  Very funny.  Anyway I am still feeling discouraged, this summer just isn´t how it should be.  I got my property grade back and I am less than thrilled.  I can´t explain how the class I worked the hardest on brought back the least desirable results.  As I said the wonders never cease.  I think my roomie is having a makeshift party in our room tonight, watching some movie called Red Dawn.  I wanna see Harry Potter really really badly, but I dunno of anyone who will see it with me, plus I would have to see it in Madrid where the closest decently sized theater is.  We went to Madrid today, we meant to see all the Museums, but we only made it through almost all of the Prado then we walked around forever and made our way back across the city to Plaza Mayor for sodas and water then walked up Calle mayor to the puerta del sol, I was the acting tour guide, we then went shopping in el corte inglés oh and before all that went all the way out to the Plaza de Toros of Madrid.  We had a very long but good, if not tiring day.  I got my laundry back yesterday from the take it and pay-by-the-pound place and it was still pretty wet, so my room looks roughly the way it did when I did all my clothes in the room with my roomie.  Tornado style.  Anyway.  Take care, I wanna go to mass tomorrow, but I can´t take communion so I feel kind of like its not the same.  By the way, Monsigneur Anderson from St. thomas, Dean Piatt, Amy, Karen and I went to dinner at a little place called Il Duetto, an Italian place and the dean payed again.  We even had Tiramisu.  I hope my incoming grades do not make me feel threatened enough to feel the need to discuss them further with the dean.
