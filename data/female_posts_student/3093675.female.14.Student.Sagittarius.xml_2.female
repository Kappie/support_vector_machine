I did, once, and I was happy for a while. The family cared about me, they gave me a place to stay, and they were nice to me. Even though I'm not finished, they were nice to me. The neighborhood was nice to me too, for the most part. There was this one lady who said I was Satanic right from the start, but otherwise, not many problems. Then Kim and her friends came home from the mountains. Kim was scared of me, and her friends didn't like me either. Then, one day, her friend Jim asked me to help him take back something that was stolen from him. I knew what he actually wanted to do- steal something from his father- but I went anyway, because Kim wanted me to. When the alarm rang, they all ran and left me to take the blame. I should have told the truth, but I didn't. Because if I  told the truth, then Kim would get in trouble, and I didn't want that.  But after I got caught, the neighborhood began to hate me, began to agree with the lady who said those things about me in the beginning. They turned around everything I had ever done. The hedges that I had carved in the beginning, the ones that they had said were "beautiful" and "original" at first, were now mostrousities in their eyes. They stopped coming over to get their hair cut by me. Then, the night of the Christmas party, it happened. I was making an ice sculpture,and Kim came out to watch. She hadn't liked me at first, but I could tell she was beginning to admire my work with the hedges, and that she liked my ice sculpture. It was of an angel. Then, when I was climbing down the ladder, Someone yelled and startled me. I jumped a little, and jerked my hand- if you could call it a hand- and I accidentally cut Kim's hand. It was an accident, and I felt terrible- but Jim was the one who had yelled, and he was now convinced that I had tried to injure Kim. She insisted that it was just a small cut, but he didn't listen. He attacked me, and then I left. I didn't know where I'd go. I just needed to get away. I walked around town, only for a few minutes, but when I got home, Kim was the only one their. She told me that her hand was fine, and that her parents were out looking for me. She wanted me to give her a hug, I told her I couldn't, because if I did, then I might hurt her. So she helped me hold my arms out so that my hands wouldn't touch her at all. Then I heard a noise outside. I looked out the window and I saw that there was a van going down the street, and it was going to hit Kevin, and I had to save him, he had been so nice to me, hadn't objected to me staying in his house or anything. I ran out the door and jumped, and I pushed him to the sidewalk on the other side of the street. But I had forgotten about my hands, and I cut his face. The neighbors all gathered around and then Kim and her parents went and brought Kevin inside. Kim ran up to me and told me to run. So I ran, all the way back home. The cops chased me, and the neighbors chased me, but i made it upstairs. Kim got to me before the neighbors, she told me she had thought I was dead. But Jim had followed her, and he tried to kill me. When I finally stood up, I had no choice, or he would have killed me. I had to stab him. He fell out of the window, he was dead. I couldnt believe what I had done. I thought Kim would hate me for it, but she told me she loved me and then she left. And that was the last I heard of any of them. Sometimes I still watch them from the mountain, but I don't know what happened after I left. Did Kim tell the truth about what she and her friends did at Jim's house? I don't know. The one thing I really know is that I can never go back down there. It's too dangerous, because even if they've forgotten about me, the same thing would happen again. I just can't be with them. Because even though it was a mistake- a lot of mistakes, really- mistakes can't be ignored if they're made by a boy who has scissors for hands.
