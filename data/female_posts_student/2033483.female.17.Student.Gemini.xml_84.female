Yesterday, I was joyfully skipping down the stairs (sarcastic, really) when all of a sudden I missed the second and most crucial one and fell down the remaining five steps.  My brother looked at me and then when he realized what I had did, he burst out laughing.  Not an "are you okay Kayla?" Nope, just hysteric laughter from my brother.  Granted, I was laughing too, because come on, I fell down the stairs.    Today I went to the mall before my Orthodontist appointment to buy this belt I've been tracking ever since it first made an appearance on ae.com.  I used Megan's gift certificate to buy the cutest belt that has a butterfly as a buckle.  It is finally mine!  After months of drooling from the window I finally own it!  Thank you Megan for helping a fantasy become a reality.  Very dramatic I know but go with it.    So after I killed enough time at the mall I went to my appointment.  I sat in the waiting for about a half hour and was royally pissed off about that.  But they cemented this wire behind my upper teeth today.  Dude, it feels so weird!  I have so much metal in my mouth I think I can start getting radio signals anytime.    So Renae asked if I'd hang out with her tonight, right.  But right when I was walking in the door she calls and says she can't hang out with me tonight.  Dudette, you asked me to hang out and then bailed on me.  What the fuck?  Mi familia and I went to Bagel Boy for supper.  My new favorite place to eat in the big S.F. I walked in and was very surprised to see Autumn Knutson working there.  She smiled when she saw me and got very excited.  Now Autumn is one of those typical popular, friends with everyone, cheerleader types.  But what sets her apart from all of her bitchy friends is the fact that she isn't a bitch.  She is honestly one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  She always says hi even when shes with all of her friends and always has something nice to say.  I've known her since elementary school and can't say this about a lot of people I've known that long but I can honestly say she is a genuinely good person.  I'm sitting here...and I have nothing profound to say.  I have a confession, however...I'm not so sure about this one but I'm gonna say it anyway to the only person that will understand.  Renae, I think I like him too.  I don't want to fuck the whole friendship thing up either but this time, I don't want to regret not trying.  Maybe he'll read this but I don't care.  This is me and this is what I am going through.    God Bless You, Kayla
