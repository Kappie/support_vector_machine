It'll be cool to be with all the guys again and stuff, but I dont want to deal with the other people. That IS going to suck.   I am really really really confused again..Thats half the reason I spazed out at band camp. I havent told anybody why yet..and I dont think Im going to. It's not the kinda thing I can just come out and tell people. Plus, it was more than just what was going thru my head. It was people pissing me off, and not caring about it. I really hope no body finds that hole in the wall that I punched... The horrible thing is, I cant even tell the guys what happened, because that would put them in such a awkward postion, and there too good of friends to do that too.   One a brighter note.. I learned tat I can unwrap a starburst in my mouth and a piece of Orbit gum. Im still working on a hershey kiss, but I know Ill be able to do that too.   I dont want to go back to band tomarrow. I only had 2 days off. Thats not enough! I need a week to recoupe. Im still kinda sick and tired from the food up in Edinboro. Damn Pizza. I dont want this school year to end. The sooner it does, the sooner I have to loose all my friends to the real world. That will just fucking suck. I better be going. I have to find out whats all going down tomarrow. Guys never tell me anything. Later.
