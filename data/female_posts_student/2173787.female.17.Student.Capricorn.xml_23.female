I don't know for sure, but I think that being happy and not knowing there was more out there would be better than knowing what happiness other people have, but not having it myself.  On a similar vein as much as it kills me not to know how people (specifically one person) feel about me it is far superior than knowing that they carry a negative opinion of me.  Somehow knowledge seeks me out though, and I doubt that I will ever just be content, instead of reaching for more.  As I become closer, the desire to be even closer becomes stronger.  Instead we delude ourselves into believing we can keep something light, and become devastated when its gone.  Although I can say what I typed, I still reach for  it  and am willing to face the consequences later.  I am tired of being alone and wish for an interval of connectedness, even if it means that I have more knowledge later of what I'm missing.
