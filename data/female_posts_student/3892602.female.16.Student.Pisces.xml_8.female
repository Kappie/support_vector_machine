(approximately three minutes later)  Well as you can see, I must be pretty, pretty bored if I am sitting down here on the computer, listening to British radio  yet again,  and   ORGANIZING THE FRICKING PICTURES IN MY PICTURES FOLDER! NOT PRINTING THEM OUT!  NOT MESSING WITH THEM IN PHOTOSHOP! ORGANIZING THEM INTO LITTLE FOLDERS WITH THEIR OWN STINKING LITTLE LABEL!!! GOD!!!    Welcome to the plethora of nothing happening in my evening.  Oh, British radio.  How I love thee.  'Scuse me for a sec.  urlLink YL  Thanxx for the patience.  Ahem...where was I?  Oh, yeah.  So anyway I'm like really getting down 'n dirty with the Christian life.  This is the best, but at the same time the toughest, decision I've ever made.  I only have one other friend who is an adamant, commited Christian, and we're clinging to each other for dear life so we don't drown in this ocean we've been plunged into.  Thank God for you, *cookie!* lol, you know who you are;)  I've got to do some major Bible-ing.  A lot of my friends need guidance and they're not getting any help from their families, so I'd better take up the perverbial cross and get 'er done, as Sarge would say.  Sarge??? Nooooooooooo! I can't believe he actually left me!  Well anyway, I think that's OK, 'cause I finally got to quit ROTC.  I mean, I'm sad b/c I actually really like ROTC, but it seems like the program at Beaver is like eating itself from the inside out.  The new sergeant is a Nazi, and it being an election year and the SAI being an adamant and somewhat insane Republican, I foresee a whole buttload of Kerry-bashing happening instead of instruction of left face, right face, port arms, et cetera, AND they decided to just throw all of the year levels together and that's like throwing Spanish II in with Latin IV.  It won't work.  So I'm out of that, thank God, and into chorus.  Good deal.  Also, the powers that be finally got me into Physics, something I'll actually use, rather than Chemistry, something that will definitely ensure me a seat on the next bus with the nice men in the crisp white clothes to the nearest Laugh Academy.   Thank you, Jesus.  Anyhoo, Counting Crows is on the "radio", and I despise them except for that Shrek theme thing.  That was them, right?  Cheers... Catherine
