My mom is right behind me on the tredmill so I can't really pour out anything deep right now.  I feel a lot better since I talked to someone about my troubles last  night and I thank that person for listening. Thats really all I needed,  someone who listened instead of talk for a while. So thank you.  There is still a lot that was never even said, but that is for me.  I can't really tell you that part. So thank you very much. You are a great person.
