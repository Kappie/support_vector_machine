Anyway, Nothing has really been going on but....gabby is just really frusterating me. What the hell does she have against me?...i've been nothing but nice to her...just bcuz her brothers SAY that i was talking about her(which i WASNT) she gets so offensive..whatever to 'if they don't like me then screw them'the whole get on with your life thing. Its not that hard to GET OVER IT and stop holding a grudge with out me know how she feels. but whats the point anyway if she doesn't even care what i say. she'll believe anything her 11 yr.old brother and her stupid 15 yr old brother say. its like...she cares but she doesn't want to. Plus i heard her talking about me to cindy on the bus. Cuz i heard cindy say'well your puting me on the spot and your making me choose' well...thats really not fair atall to cindy and...isn't alil weird how i didn't even talk about her to begin with and she goes off and starts yaking to bill and cindy? thats not cool. David(her lil brother) makes up things all the time especially about me. He spread a rumor that i flashed josh and that i talk about gabby all the time. Everyone believes him! whats up with that?...we're all 13,15, and 19 yr olds here...we really shouldn't be relying on david for information about another person. He just has to be the one to cry wolf. What will I do when something really bad happens...i prolly wont believe it if david is the one to tell me. David pulls the fire alarms, david always gets hurt, david makes up rumors, david makes so much noise and disrupts the apartment complex(S). Should ANYONE believe this lil kid?...gabby will believe anything her brothers say and deny anything we tell her about them..how the REALLY act!!! This is NOT fair atall. I am nothing but nice to gabby, i never have talked bad about her, about looks personality or her living style. NEVER!...and she will believe her family. Im still trying to think about where the whole 'live and let live' thing went. I have friends and family around me 24/7 and not once have i talked bad about gabby.     You know what...i think me and gabby have been friends long enough to know that I dont talk about her that way....how can she think that i talk bad about her. Just one lil comment that her lil brother makes and everything is HELL! whats up with that??????? Plus...we need Kevin one of her other lil brothers likes witchcraft and wants to do spells with me bill and keith but gabby (of course) wont let him. we need him for a circle dammit!...I try to be calm...but...why is it that when i walk and i see her she gets all pissed when i haven't done SHIT! whatever....I dont' even give a shit about what she thinks. As long as i got alla my feelings out right now...i'll be totally centered when i see her. Which i hope i wont.   I was supposed to go to see bill today also to see....someone but...when i called bill he was in traffic...i could tell by the rain and the cars. lol...but anyway...i need to go to the book store so i can get a BOS. If you don't know what that means...i'll tell ya later.   invoke fire element:(this works) Fire i call upon your heat to aid me in this magkal feat Give me what i ask of the As i will so mote it be.  u need fire to do this.....no wind!
