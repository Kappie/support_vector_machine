(how's that for alliteration?) i think i will end up voting republican for governor and democrat for president. (go dean!) both of which, of course, will most likely lose anyway.  i would like to make it a tentative goal to run in the LA marathon in may. i don't care about my finish time, my goal is just to finish the race, and live to tell about it.  when my self-imposed bank account freeze is over (lord give me strength), the first thing i'm gonna do is go to b to buy the following books: -she's not there by jenny boylan -benjamin franklin -kavalier and clay -  there were some other books i wanted. can't remember right now. will revise later.
