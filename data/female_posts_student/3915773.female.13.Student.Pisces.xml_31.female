The movie is basically the old fairy tale, Cinderella, modernized. As says the review,     Even for a fairy tale, “A Cinderella Story”, directed by Mark Rosman from a screenplay by Leigh Dunlap, fails to make sense. In an environment where looks are everything, no one notices that Samantha is far and away the prettiest girl in high school. Only a blind person could fail to guess the Girl in White’s identity when she makes her entrance wearing a tiny white mask. And a dropped cell phone as a substitute for a glass slipper simply will not do.    I haven’t seen this movie, but I have seen ads for it, and I got the same impression. Is Hollywood so uncreative that it can’t even come up with a new idea for a movie, and is forced to hash and rehash old fairy tales? And on top of that, mess it up? The media is largely based on money, and while some people do get jobs by pure talent, most get jobs by money, or knowing the right people (who, coincidentally, have money). So not necessarily all movies have large amounts of talent, creativity and/or thought to back them up.    While I probably don’t have the right to criticize a movie that I haven’t seen, I do find it interesting that there have been so many different retellings of Cinderella over the years. Yet I don’t know of any greatly publicized modern retellings besides this movie. Perhaps old fairy tales were meant to stay old. Maybe the media has used up all the material left in this well-known story, and should try to some new idea. If the media tries out one thing, and it turns out to be a great hit, they’ll keep doing it over and over until everything’s dry, boring and uninteresting. And even then they will continue with the idea until it makes no money at all anymore.    The long and short of it is that the media doesn’t really care what the general response to its products is, just as long as the products bring in money. The Cinderella Story will probably make some money, and the media will continue to create new Cinderella stories until no one watches, reads or listens to them, since in our modern, money-based world, income comes first. Quality is second.
