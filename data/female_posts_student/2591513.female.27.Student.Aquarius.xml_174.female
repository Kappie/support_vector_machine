This is one of those days you wish you had a girlfriend to call up and just bawl on the phone. AH!!  I guess I was thinking of the child who died.  He was born around the same time as Bailey, had his surgeries around the same time and we saw them every now and then during certain hospital visits.  He had a very similar condition as Bailey.  He passed away in school before his mom could get there.  MY WORST NIGHTMARE!  So of course in typical mommy fashion, I imagined my life without Bailey and now I am just crying and crying and then missing my dad.  OH THE HORROR!  I cannot imagine my life without Bailey...everything I am and everything I know is because he came into my life and blessed me with a love I cannot explain.  The mere thought scares the shit out of me.  Gosh you w*ould think I was psycho right now.  Loss...I hate thinking about loss...because the baby came to mind.  The baby number four that this bllog was initially dedicated to.    Snap out of it...God brought Bailey here for a reason, there is a reason why he has constantly defied the odds.  Sorry guys, a short loss of composure on my part.  I feel better.  I guess I just had to write it out since I don't have someone to call.  Thanks everyone for the kind comments lately.  They have been such an uplifting addition to my days.
