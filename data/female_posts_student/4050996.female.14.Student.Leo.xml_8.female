Okay, forget it. I'm going to talk about something happy today.  So, August 4 2004. Two days ago. Not exactly NEWs.  The cute postman dropped two very thick envelopes on my house porch when I just arrived home from school. And they were addressed to me. No surprises here. But I was really happy to get the letters, ah... ok, books. It was the first two books I ever got since joining BookCrossing. Two Stephen King books, in fact.   -   urlLink  The Stand    -  urlLink  Rose Madder       I finished Rose Madder already, so it's available. But i'm going to take ages reading The Stand. Man, they're thick. 1421 pages, imagine that!  Due to trial exams just around the corner, I may not be able to blog as much as I like, cos' mum and dad is keeping their eyes on me.
