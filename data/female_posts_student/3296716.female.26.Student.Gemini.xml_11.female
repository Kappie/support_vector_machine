We talked different ways to bring up my research objectives to the school district where I will (hopefully) be working- I need to ease them into it.   Also, as far as human subjects go, I can wait at least until September.   Ok- here was the big thing- I need to write my proposal. This scared me! It just seems so big and ... intimidating. So, he suggested that I write a little every day- make a draft tonight and then "revise" it every day until our next meeting, which is next Tuesday. That made it easier to think about, and made it seem like a more manageable task. :)
