Maybe I just picked up on it because I've been in a silimiar situation.  Obviously not the same causes or anything, but I've definitely felt something close to what you just described.  Anyway, all I really have to say is that nothing you can do would make us feel any different towards you Josh.  You're one of my best friends in the entire world, Abby or no.  Nothing can change the history.  The other thing is that you really needn't ask forgiveness from us, but if you need to hear it, we forgive you.  Clean slate, Tabula rosa.  Start again if you want to, but there's really no need.  We love you for who you are, Josh, whoever that is.  And if it's the person you were before, we support that.  If it's a different person, we support that too.  You need to do what makes you happy.  No one else matters.  Not me, not Abby, not Rosie, nor Will or Liz.  Take yourself into account first and worry about the rest of us later.  We'll support you no matter what you do.  We've all been through a lot of stuff together, and this is just another thing to overcome.  We're the closest-knit group of friends I've ever had, and nothing can ever break that.  Nothing.  We're here for you, Josh.  No matter what hour of the day, what day of the week.  We're always here for you.  Call me if you need me for anything. 473-2890.  You're one of the greatest people on earth, and don't let anyone tell you any different.  Don't let yourself tell you any different.
