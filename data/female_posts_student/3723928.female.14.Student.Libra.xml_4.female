I want to tell you how I feel, and that I really truely do like you a lot and when you hugged me on friday in jungle fun, you don't know what that felt like to me. It was like I had heaven in my arms, like nothing else mattered in the world except for me  you. I'm seriously falling for you  I don't know if what you told me was lies just to lead me on to see if I would fall for you or not or if they were true  you really did mean what you said. I'm sorry for being quiet, and for not being who I am. When I was with you I was so nervous  shy because I was afraid of what you might think of me if I was myself. You don't know how badly I wanted to kiss you and spend more time with you that night. I didn't ever want it to end. And if I could go back in time and stay in one moment forever it would have been that night. I want to be who you want me to be but its so hard. But I promise you that if you give me one more chance I know I can change, and I know I can treat you like how you should be treated. I think I might love you John. You mean so much to me  your the only guy thats ever seemed so effen perfect to me ever since the first time I saw you. Your everything I've ever wanted in a guy, your smart, and sweet, you smell awsome  your personality is so perfect. Your not too loud  obnoxius, and your so easy to talk to. Your so effen handsome  just the right height.I just wish that I could open up to you...let you into my heart. I guess I'm just afraid that if I do let you in you'll just use me  leave me heartbroken  bruised in the end. One more chance is all that I want...just to prove to you that I  CAN  be who you want me to be, I can be your perfect girl...I love you. I can't stop thinking about you. Your always in my dreams, and where ever I go I always want you near. Can you hear me when I scream your name at night? Can you feel my arms around you when I squeeze my pillow tight imagineing its you I'm holding? Do you hear me when I whisper "I love you" after you hang up the phone? Do I ever cross your mind? Have you ever dreamt about me  woken up to find yourself squeezing your pillow tight? I don't know what to do, what to say, when your holding me in your arms...You leave me in a bliss. And I love that about you. If only you knew you meant this much to me.   I will always love you, Ally
