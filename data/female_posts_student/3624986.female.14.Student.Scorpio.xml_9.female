The word poet, on the FictionPress.Com dictionary, is defined as  a writer of poems (the term is usually reserved for writers of good poetry) . I, as the author of my poetry (as well as any other type of piece that I do), have no right to judge my writing as good, but I use the term  poet  loosely. I have been writing poetry for two to four years (I've lost track of the times, I suppose), and although I follow no clear "form" in my poetry, I suppose I can say that I have had experience in the writing of it.
