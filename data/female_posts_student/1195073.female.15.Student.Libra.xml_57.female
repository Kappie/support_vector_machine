I don't know if everything I want to pack will fit in the suitcase. If the airline looses my luggage I will be pissed. I have good clothes packed (I have to look super glamourous).      Speaking of good clothes, I went shopping again yesterday. Got another pair of shoes from American Eagle and a pair of pants and a shirt I've been wanting forever from there as well. I got pajamas and socks, too. And I got my hair did and a pedicure! Now I got cute little rhinestone flowers on my big toenails!      Tomorrow I gotta go to the ortho and HOPEFULLY he's gonna start taking my braces off.      Molly          "Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills. You know, like nunchuck skills, bowhunting skills, computer hacking skills..."           You know, that's the truth.
