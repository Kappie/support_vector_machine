I am trying not to be a hostile, cold-hearted bitch (that my parents describe me as) about it, but at the same time I'm trying not to get it out of perspective.  I will miss her, but all the same I can realize it's for a good reason.  She almost bit me the other day when I came home.  I was standing in the living room talking to the rents about my new job (at the chocolate factory) and she tears across the room, leaps over my dad and lunges for my stomach.  I don't know when she's going.  Sometime in the next couple of days.  My mom's friend, Jan is coming over to pick her up.  My dad was torn up.  He is so attatched to her and it's fucking Father's Day.    It's amazing how I can plan to act one way and feel another and everything falls to pieces when I hear he is going away.  I was really trying to play it off as, 'I don't want to jump back into anything just yet, I'm not sure what I think of you, and tons of other crap.'  I know how I feel about it, and I can't bear the thought of him with someone else.  This Summer is turning to crap.  Very quickly too.  I haven't run in two days... dont know why I've all of a sudden become lazy and careless about our soccer conditioning...  And by the way.  I found a really good cd to drive around with when I am angry.  The new Avril Lavigne cd, which I don't traditionally listen to this type of music.  More along the lines of Modest Mouse or RHCP, but... I must say her vocals have tremendously improved since her last album (which gave me a headache).  But my sister and I like to compare her to Alanis Morissette now.  =)  I strongly reccommend it to all the angry and discouraged girls out there, who would like to rant and rave about their boy problesms. =P  Although her lyrics still need help, I can honestly to relate to them.  This is all for now I have things to do!
