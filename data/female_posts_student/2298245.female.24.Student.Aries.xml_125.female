Perhaps it is untrue, but it is from a most reliable friend of mine who I am sure put some investigation into the matter before telling me.  This is the final straw for me.  I was on the fence about seeing the movie, though the oddity of the casting had lead me to lean against.  But still, there is a lot of buzz and some good reviews for it out there, so I was being pulled in the other way, part of me willing and trying to give it a chance.  This, though, coupled with the fact that it is directed by Anthony Minghella - a man that I have never quite forgiven for  The English Patient  - has planted me firmly in the "no see" camp.  This is doubly true now that I am back in New York; I will not pay $10 to see this movie.    What is the problem with filming it in Romania, you ask?  The movie is supposed to take place in the United States, particularly the South.  There are plenty of places to film in order to make it look realistic.  Hell, filming it on a studio backlot would make it look more realistic than filming in Romania, which I'm quite sure looks nothing like it does here.  It doesn't look like the South at any rate.    The casting is another frustrating problem for me.  I mean nothing against Nicole Kidman or Jude Law:  I think both of them are excellent actors.  But I'm not sure either one of them have proven adept enough at something that is very hard to do, and that is accents.  Sure, they have had different accents in movies and it has been okay.  But the Southern accent is one of the more difficult ones out there to make sound convincing.  I have not seen the movie, so I suppose I shouldn't complain, but I did see the trailer, and I do believe that the accents sounded slightly forced in that forum.  Then again, very few movies even attempt to get the Southern accent right, and even when actual Southerners are cast, they seem to be doing a caricature of their own accent rather than a true one.    Then again, Vivien Leigh and Leslie Howard were British...Perhaps I just like to have something to complain about.  Maybe the accents just seem fake because I already know that isn't how they really talk and I am that much more ready to judge them.  And then you really do run across people in the South who do talk like that.  So I'm done with my rant now, and I am sorry to waste everyone's time.  The main reason I won't see the movie is that it looks like an awful bore to me, and I have seldom been impressed with the director's work, though I did rather like  The Talented Mr. Ripley .
