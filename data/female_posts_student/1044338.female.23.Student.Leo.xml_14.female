A young girl's parents and her grandmother tricked society into thinking that this poor girl was dying of lukemia so that they could collect funds from the charity they were promoting. It turns out that the whole thing was a hoax, and the girl is perfectly healthy. However, the parents and grandmother went as far as shaving the girl's head, giving her sleeping pills and putting her in counselling to prepare her for death. Now, if that's not traumatizing for a girl, I don't know what is. I wonder how this poor girl will turn out to be when she's older. Did anyone else hear about this?
