"my life depends on melissa's blog."  there.  that's much better.  now, onto my exciting entry.  i suppose i'll begin with friday- had a really great day for the most part.  i had a good laugh friday morning because of charles... hehe hes so funny :)  band was a lot of fun and of course, the fact that there was no game was awesome.  so after rehearsal, we all saw "sweet home alabama".  talk about disappointment!!  i was so looking forward to seeing it.. and i finally get to- and its TERRIBLE!  so predictable and lame.  and all the jokes pretty much fell flat.  after that, we went on over to kevin's house and watched tv for a while.  southpark was quite enjoyable- alabama man! "i thought i told you to shut up! *smacks other barbie doll*"  haha.. and then the whole predicament with charles's car keys... but it all turned out ok.  so then saturday, i pretty much sat around for the first part of the day, then charles, mooney, and i went to visit habibi up at game stop.  and i organized game boy games for a meager 25 cents!  i should've made like 20% of habibi's paycheck, but whatever- i guess you've gotta be thankful for whatever you get.  hehe  i do appreciate the quarter, mooney.  i'll give it back, though.  i really don't have much use for a quarter anyways.  anyhoo, then after that we saw "RED DRAGON"!  which was AWESOME!  definitely one of my favorites- not as good as "silence of the lambs", but definitely one of the best movies i've seen in a long time.  and then we went over to ross's (after sitting in the wendy's parking lot for a while, trying to decide what to do) and watched tv.  and then went home!  overall, a good day.  and then we get to sunday.  i woke up at 7 to get to church by 7:45 to help out w/ sunday school, and then afterwards, my dad suggested going to local diner.  i didn't really want to, but i reluctantly agreed... and it turned out to be really cool.  my dad and i actually talked.  like, not just small talk.. but   talk talk.  it was very nice, indeed.  and then my mom got home around 3:30 and boy, was i ever glad to see her!  a whole week without mom was pretty stressful.  there was practically no food in the house, all my clothes were dirty, the house was a wreck, and my dad tended to get on my nerves ALL THE TIME!  so i talked to her for like 10 minutes, but then i had to go to church.  so i went to mass, was insulted by eric (for piper, no less! haha), and then went out to eat with my parents to cheddars.  yummy food.  and that brings me here!  im just hanging out w/ the parentals... catchin up with my mom and stuff.  definitely a GREAT day!  and hopefully, tomorrow will be even better!  things are looking up already, since there's no school, and that automatically puts me in a good mood.  so thats my weekend in a nutshell.  i hope you found it as enjoyable as i did!  i don't really have anything thought-provoking or insightful to say, so i guess i'll just leave it at that.  adios mis amigos!
