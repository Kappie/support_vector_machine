I went to talk to Mr. Kaukus today... and, surprisingly, we talked a lot.  He's a pretty good guy... and he's got his ear pierced too.  How crazie is that? =P... UHM, he explained a lot of things to me, and yeh, he heard me out with the things that I wanted to say.  Then, I asked him about Alicia.  Since grade 8, she would be the one I'd go to talk to if I had a problem... she was and still is such an awesome mentor =)  So yep, he told me that she'd been back for 3 weeks, but she hadn't come to drop by the school yet.  But yeh,... I think talking to him helped me,... a LITTLE bit.  But yeh, then lunch came, and I went with Roxie to the Shell... and there was the cutest puppy!! MAN, I would soooo take her, but yeh, I was told no =(  But that's ohkiee, cuz I have my puppy!! hehehe... And then, yehh, I went to Math, and as always, it was boring... but, at 1ish, guess who came?! ALICIA!! MAN was it good to see her!  And yeh, she took me outta class, hehe... and, we talked for about half an hour.  I really did miss talking to her... but yeh, I told her lots, and she told me things, too... and yeh, she did make me feel better.  She's totally awesome!  And, when it was time to say goodbye, it was still good... because she sayd the most encouraging thing that I've heard in the LONGEST time.  She is such an amazing person.  Then yeh, English came and went, and then I came home.  I was here with Gerardo... and yeh, he was being a dork, like always... but I love him hehe... and yeh, he was on msn, and I realized that he is SUCH A FLIRT!  But, I guess it's ohkay right, cuz yeh, they are his friends... lol, altho, you wouldn't think so =P  mmmmm.... but yeh, that's all for today,... or yeh, for now.  Best day this week! =)
