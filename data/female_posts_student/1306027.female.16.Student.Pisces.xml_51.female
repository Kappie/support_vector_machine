AP American History is slightly a pain in my bum. I mean- scalawags is an awesomely sweet word and all, but I'm just not at all into American History. I love European History though... which is slightly strange. Does that make me- o forget it lol.    Hero of the Day  No, it's not you again Carmen. It's strongbad. The dude has some incredible talent answering emails like he does. I totally did the WWE outfit too. It rocks. If you don't know who strongbad is than you have been seriously deprived. I suggest you go to  urlLink HomestarRunner  immediately.   Been redoing my website  Yea- I've been redoing it for about 5 months now. I wasn't actually doing anything, just claimed that I was to make it look like I didn't have commitment issues. But anyways I got the background done. It's super spantactical. I'm not going to tell you what it looks like though because it's a secret. I think I will launch the site sometime in the near future.   In the mean time  I'm listening to a song Ritu sent me. It's "Do you believe in magic"- by loving spoonful. It's one of those "Get your butt outta the computer chair and dance all around the room", songs.     HUTTAH!
