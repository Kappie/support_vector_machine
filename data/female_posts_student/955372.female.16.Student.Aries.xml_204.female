And i'm thinking if you touch me again i will rip that noodle from your hand and strangle you with it! Yeah so while she's like noodle-raping/ savagely beating us i'm like wow what happened to the laws against child abuse... Yeah speaking of smacking people's asses. Today when i was getting my books out of my locker after 7th period this guy walks buy and like grabs/touches/you get the point and i just figured that he bumped into be. And then he turns around and goes "OH GOD I didn't mean to grab your ass!!!" and he like yells it. And me and christina like cracked up. It was pretty funny.
