It is only when He is in the 1st place, then i will really experience the joy when doin things tht i feel stress about... Like on thursday i so sad... so down... feel so lousy... but during guitar, i told God tht am i going to bring these feelings to guitar? I mean ok lah... i feel stress but somehow i commit it to God... then ok lorh... during guitar i forgot alot of things... i just concentrate on wad i need to do in guitar... so it was ok... Oh then yesterday i went to watch i-robot with my friends... wanted to watch mean girls... but finish liao... then i was so piss off... i dun like robotic show... starting of it i was like grumbling... then feel like sleeping like tht... Until i told myself, "hey! am i going to waste my money? am i going to waste my time here? God, show me wad u wan me to learn from this movie..." Hey... Even robots have purpose! they got 3 laws to follow... and when they follow, everything was good... until here comes a type of robot who did not follow... then the whole world became chaotic... then among them comes "sonny"... He could not find his purpose... Why did his "father" create him? He went to search for his purpose... Eventually found... And he fulfilled it... I think this reminds me of something tht happened in the bible... God created men... He has a set of rules for us to follow... It was good when we go according to His plan... But when we disobey, everything became chaotic... Then "sonny", we are like him sometimes... searching for our purpose... And when we found it, everything was good... We have Jesus... He came down here to wash our sins... If we followed Him in the first place, everything would be fine... But we din, we caused our Creator to suffer... And right now... there are still ppl disobeying... Funny rite... How we are worst then robots... Even robots have purpose... haha... Do we? I have!!!
