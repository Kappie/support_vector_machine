I just got in a huge screaming match with Mom and Chelsea, which wouldn't be terribly bad except that this is the second or third in as many days. We never used to fight like this. We would fight, but none of us would ever get as angry as we've been getting. I just cussed them both out; I called Chelsea a bitch and - this is the worst part and I hate myself for it - I told Mom that sometimes I wish she would just die. I don't, really, but my saying that made me realize that I do need to just be away from all of this shit. The entire family is so on edge, so stressed, that our tempers are on short fuses. I just...I need to move out for a little while. Not sure where I could go, though. I might ask Val, but to be honest I'm not entirely sure her parents would go for that. My parents wouldn't either, I don't think, but at this point I don't give a fuck. How the hell am I supposed to deal with all of this when I'm right in the middle of it? This is by far the hardest time in my life, and instead of it making me stronger it's destroying me. I feel like somebody cut me up and tossed my pieces all over town, and now some unknown force is trying to put me back together but I'm too spread out, and too finely chopped, so they can't find all of me and I'm destined to stay torn up forever. I can't help but wonder if maybe -  maybe  - just not living here for a while would help any. I can't help it; I love my family but right now I need to distance myself from them. At the same time, though, I'm torn because if my family ever needed to stay together, it's right fucking now. I don't think Mom would take it well at all, which is something she really doesn't need (the stress). I dunno. I'm always close to that breaking point, because I have depression and I've just never been entirely happy, but now I'm only like one step away from that point. I don't think I've ever been this close to a breakdown without actually breaking down.  See, I've had all of two mental breakdowns in my life and let me tell you - they suck ass. Number one was several years ago, when I was ten or eleven. I don't remember any of the details, but I spent nearly 24 solid hours just crying. The second and last one was last summer (almost a year to the day ago). I had been depressed for six months by that point, and I would lay in bed at night and just cry and think, this isn't right. I shouldn't be feeling like this. Then one day something inside me just exploded and I ended up physically hurting Chels. It turned into this huge mess and I was put into counsling and all this stuff. All that is beside the point, though. The point is, after that instant in which I threw the sharp object at a certain sister's...head...I spent days just crying and hating myself and just wanting to die. I thought about suicide contantly, and I was just emotionally a wreck. Looking back, I don't even think I was all here, mentally, during that time. I do not want that to happen again. Life just ends, which admittidly wouldn't be that different from life happening, but it still bites. I'm afraid that if one more thing happens, which is pretty much inevitable, I'm going to take that last step into mental nothingness. The logical, humane part of me is terrified of doing so and wants to do everything possible to avoid it. The cynical, depressed side of me, however,  wants  to take that last step. To just...lose myself in my own hate and self-terror. That's the best way to describe my mental breakdowns: I'm full of self-hate, I'm scared to death of what I might do to myself (I've plotted my own suicide many times; I decided that I would overdose on my antidepressants simply because it's quick and - most importantly - ironic), and overall I don't see how anything can go on.   The thing that scares me the most is that I'm already feeling myself start to think this way. More and more lately, I've started wondering what things would be like if I wasn't around. Not dead, necessarily, just not here. I've been thinking about suicide and death more, and I've started cussing for no fucking reason (see?). This  isn't  me. At least, it never used to be. Many days the only reason I get out of bed at all is because I have to take care of Zeus (the number one reason I have for not being able to move out - I wouldn't be able to take him and missing him would kill me b/c I adore him) and because not getting up would piss Mom off, which would start a fight, and I just plain don't have enough in me to even argue. I don't feel like I even have enough energy to  not  fight, if that makes sense.   Depression is such a fucking bitch. So is cancer.   ...So am I.    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  moodless  listening to/watching ::  Linkin Park, Meteora  eating/drinking ::  nothing  craving ::  ...  talking to ::  NOBODY!  thinking about ::  nothing. I am thoughtless.  wishing ::  nothing.  wearing ::  clothes  random ::  please...just...nevermind.
