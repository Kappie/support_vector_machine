Today I need to clean up a bit and then spend the night with Jessica so as to awaken early enough to arrive at Six Flags early enough for a fun day. W00t!  My back hurts incredibly, and I don't know why. I don't recall ever pulling the muscle that's bothering me oh-so-badly. Ehhh. It's been hurting since yesterday afternoon in the early, and it's starting to worry me a bit. I just hope that super roller coaster riding tomorrow won't totally crack my back in half. If so, everyone's invited to attend my funeral!    Italy paperwork is still to be finalized... *boils with anger at the mother* I said I'd do it if she needed me to, but nooooooooo! "Oh, don't worry about it, I'll take care of it!" Yeah, right! I should have known better than believing her. So, I guess I'll need to do that very soon as I still do want to leave the country.    I'm confuzzled as always, and suddenly I'm in a state of utter "oh-wow-I-have-no-idea-just-what-I'm-thinking-or-doing-help!!!". It's never too pleasant. I just hope I can figure something effective out very very very soon, as I am copiously uncomfortable with the current situation. I'm sure I confused you beyond belief by this point, but this was a selfishly typed section for my simple relief, and I must be utterly taciturn about everything and anything around it.   My house and room and bathroom and fish need help, so I'd better go, as I haven't much time left!
