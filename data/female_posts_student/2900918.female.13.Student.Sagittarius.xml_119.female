Ridgeland Ave., Tinley Park Information: (312) 559-1212  Some celebrities get so tough and hard when it comes to interviews. Given they probably have earned enough cred to do so, but it is still refreshing to get a laid-back big-timer who isn't full of himself. Lucky for me, I got to interview Tom DeLonge, singer/guitarist for super punk band blink-182, a relaxed stud who has developed as a musical God in the intricate workings of my head. Enjoy!   What's up Tom?  Hey, what's going on?   How are you doing?   I am doing, um, well. How are you doing?   I am good. I am kind of excited to interview you because you guys are like one of my favorite bands.  Oh, wow. Well, thank you. How did we get that spot on your roster?   I don't know, I have just loved you guys since you first started. It kind of makes me a little more nervous to interview you than some of the other hot shot celebs I have talked to.   Don't worry, I am nervous, too. I always do so bad at interviews.   Let's just have fun with it then.   Yeah, let's just have fun with it dude.   How much does it suck having to be interviewed so many times in a day?   It doesn't suck actually, I don't have to do that many. They never set up too many at once for me.   How many do you have to do in a day?   35,000. (Laughs)   That's a lot. Good luck with that. Hey, what's my age again?   Um, what's your age again?   Yeah, I forgot.   Mine or yours?   No, what's mine?   You are 23.   Oh, very good. That's impressive.   Are you really 23?   Yes I am.   Oh wow. (Laughs)   Are you stalking me?   Um, no. (Laughs)   How cool is it to be in blink-182?   That's a good question. It is pretty cool. It has its ups and downs, but it's great to be in a band with great music. But it's hard to be used as a piece of meat all day long by the media.   Do you ever look in the mirror and go, "holy [bleeeeeep], I'm famous?"   No, no, I look in the mirror and go, 'holy [bleeeeeep], I need to stop eating.'   You're getting fat?   No, um, um, yeah. (Laughs) I am getting super, super fat. So fat that I can't even fit on stage anymore.   That sucks.   Yeah, you're telling me. (Laughs)   You're the leader of the band.   Not necessarily the leader, but definitely the good looking one. In some parts of the country at least.   Is that helping you with the ladies?  No, but definitely with the men.   That's what I want to hear. Your milkshake can bring me to your yard. Hey, what if you left blink and became a white rapper, what would your name be?   If I were a white rapper my name would be Slurpie. It's like a new and improved ice.   Are you a Slurpie guy?   No. I am a water or wine guy. I don't really drink Slurpies.   How hot is Gwen [Stefani]? Is she a perfect 10?   Oh, she's up there. If not, close.   I heard you hooked up with her. Is that true?   Yeah, right. (Laughs)   Don't lie to me!   (Laughs) I would have to if I went along with your story.   Come on, can't you hook a brotha up with a headline?   Your headline â€“ you can make up anything you want besides that one.   We have gotten along, so I have to ask if I can be your friend?   It just depends. There is a waiting list.   How far down am I?   You are um, No. 1. There actually isn't anyone on the list. (Laughs)   (Laughs) That's good. Maybe I can sneak in soon. Jim Breuer created a great voicemail message for me, and obviously you are cooler than Jim, so will you do one for me?   Alright. (Laughs) 'Hey, this is Tom from blink 182, and you have reached Nick's phone, and he is one of my best friends in the whole world. Often we kiss, but when we are not kissing he will return calls just like this.'   bold --interviewer normal--mr. t delonge
