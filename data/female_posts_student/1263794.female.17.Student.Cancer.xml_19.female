I mean I would bug my mom forever just to take me to office depot, and I would have a blast there  buying all these things I didn't even need but HAD to get because I was so "caught up" in the mood. To this day I have no idea why this was so fun for me. Actually I think maybe it was the time organizing things when I got home that was so great. Everything was so neat and organized and every single year I would make a vow to myself that I was going to keep it like that for the year and it NEVER worked. But for that one week of school I just loved the "neatness", I mean I would just open my bookpack and look, and I would want to show everybody. Man back to school shopping was almost worth summer ending.  But hitting high school things changed. I never want go school shopping because that means school was starting, and I just wanted to put it off forever. I think I'm kind of always in denial up until that one trip to the store. This year it didn't really hit me for a long while. I think it was the book fair when I finally realized " A whole new year is starting". And although bummed, I starting thinking about the oppurtunitys that awaited ahead of me. I mean there are gonna be new friends, new guys, new teachers, new everything, and I you know I keep telling myself I hate school and don't want to go back, and sure there are parts of me that don't, but I have to admit I love for all these new things to enter into my life. The start of a school year is pretty exciting. So much happens in one year. I think of friends that have become really close to me, I think of guys that have drove me crazy, I think of all I've learned about myself and I think that all these things happen in such a short period of time. I think back at how different I am from freshman year, and I really wonder what is in store for me this year.    I noticed another thing as well. When I was in middle school I always had to get the "cool" pencils and pens and other supplies, and it never even occured to me that all these things were so trivial and stupid, not to mention the fact that they racked up tons of money. But as I was walking down the aisle I realized I really didn't care what I pencils I used, and I picked up the cheapest ones as they seemed the most practical.  This is something that has changed about me as well, and I love that it has. I can really say with confidence that I don't care what people think of me half as much as I used to. I think it happened somewhere in the middle of freshman year. Well I don't really know but I'm just glad it happened. I think if I met up with my "old self" I really don't think I would like me much. Some people just care sooo much about what people think of them that they change themselves so much to make them more likeable. I know this sounds like something you hear about everywhere from adults and teachers or what not, and we all say we don't do it but sooo many people still do, and frankly it drives me crazy. I love being myself.
