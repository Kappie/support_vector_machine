I seriously think I missed whatever that movie was about.  For those of you out there who've seen it, will you explain it?  The reason why it scared it me is that its about this guy who needs to find a place to stay, and he goes to this mansion which has some creepy and mean owners.  A nice girl who lives there shows him this room that hasn't been used for ages and gives it to him for the night.  So he sits down and ofcourse there's a storm outside and all of a sudden a these branches crash and break the window.  So he pushes them back outside but when he pulls his hands back in the branches have been replaced by two hands gripping is.  He looks out the window and there's this ghost with white clothes moaning  Come with me, Cooooomeee with meeeeee .  And thats where the story begins.  Freaky Deaky  So now I gotta finish P  I'll tell you all how I liked the end because I know you care.
