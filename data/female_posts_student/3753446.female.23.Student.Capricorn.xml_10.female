'And you have a voice in a country where it's very hard to be heard ...'" Nice! Maybe that should be in our tour. "   My sisters are hooked up! I always get excited when I hear about Muslim women taking steps in the right direction. Speaking up, getting out, etc. I remember what it was like in Bangladesh a loong loong time ago, and women couldn't even go to the mosque with the men. I remember I got sneered at when I went with my dad, and I was only six years old! And what amazes me more is that these repressive rules weren't part of Islam as it was originally. I'd be happy to share resources if anyone is interested. And I'm way generalizing here, but its pretty fascinating what a little bit of superstition, an overactive and undereducated rumor mill, and some institutionalized dogma can do to entire cultures. Speaking of education, I still think women's education will save the world. Mothers are the first teachers after all.
