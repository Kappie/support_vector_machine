We have not been able to have him in our lives since Christmas of 2002, when his mother found out Robert and I were engaged.  Ascension's mother teaches him to hate his father. She hardly ever has the boy he is usually with her ex boyfriend and his parents since they have a lot of money. The ex boyfriend has been in Ascension's life since he was two.  We will be taking her to court to get set visitation back since she has been in violation of the court order that was set more than a year ago stating that my husband was to be able to see his son when Ascension is at his grandfather's house. Robert is good friends with Ascension's mother's dad (grandfather). Since the court order was set Ascension's mother will not let him stay at his grandfather's house thus not letting Robert see his son.  I think that she is afraid that Ascension will love to be with us and grow to not like the person who has never been good to him. Robert is an excellent father. He may not get to be with his son right now but he is the only father that I have ever considered my children to have. I think Ascension is missing out on very important time with Robert. I do not understand how the legal system can prevent a loving father from being able to see his son.  There is much more to say on this subject, I will add more at a later time. In some cases I feel that the father is not given enough rights as a parent just because the mother carried the child for 9 months, sometimes the mother's are given too much power and I don't think that this benefits the child in any way.  I think that we should fight for joint custody. We moved here because Ascension lives here. We have lived here for two years and only got to see him barely a month and a half of it. He got to come over here a lot until one day when Robert was at work and Ascensions bus dropped him off here to me in the afternoon. When Ascension's mother got off work that day and came here to pick him up he started screaming and bawling because he wanted to stay here. That was the end of him spending so much time over here. I like to see my kids get upset when they have to leave grandma or others, at least this way I know that they like to be there.  More to come..
