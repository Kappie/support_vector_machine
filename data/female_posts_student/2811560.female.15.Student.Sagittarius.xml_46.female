We sat around for like 2 hours and then went from cue to cue which was really confusing and not cool. Then I had my audition for the Schaumburg Flyers, and that went really well. After tech, Michelle, Jasmine and I went to Aurelio's for lunch. Jasmine and I....we aren't really friends anymore. At least not like we used to be. Meh. I hate to say it, but the truth is, I don't rely on her for companionship as much as I used to. And I'm fine with that. I have a lot of friends that care about me and share the same values that I do. Jasmine and I just don't anymore. Anyways, Mel, Emily and I went to Battle of the Bands to see Richie Ribando and the Swingin Six, which was hysterical. They were actually really good for putting it together in two weeks. After that I went home. I felt really lame coming home at 8:30 on a Saturday night. A bunch of people were going out afterwards, but no one really invited me, and I didn't want to ask to go with them...so yeah. I felt left out :(. Whatever. I caught up on my sleep which was nice. We went to church this morning and there was this musical thing they did which was really cool. A bunch of people I know were in it like Cathie, Jenna, Josh, Kelly, and Lizz. It was really good. So I think I'm going to get involved with the choir there at Trinity. Fun stuff. I'm going to buy new hot rollers for the play today. I'm really happy because I'm doing two dress rehearsals on Monday and Wednesday. Lucky me. I'm excited to see my costume, too. Its coming tomorrow. I hope its not ugly. That wouldn't be fun. Busy week coming up.
