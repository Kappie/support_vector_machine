AHA!! ask = miłość :)  it's too late.  ok, gotta get that stuff and go and do sth like read bułhakow. this book has 500 pages... i don't know yet if this is good. i like myself with that sunburn, cos it looks different from my usual teint. doesn't matter really that it hurts. actually it really isn't that bad, there only are like two places where it hurts when i touch them + my skin is hot which is normal when you've been exposing your shoulders and decoltee to the sun from 11 am to 4 pm which is not really a good thing to do without using any sunblocker. hahaha, this was irresponsible of me. so what? i am irresponsible. these are the proofs: who climbs cherrytries that are said to be 'frail'? --> thats the translated word my grandmother used to describe them. who gets himself poisoned by......... ?[not gonna say what] who cuts a 20 m long hedge during one day so that he can't use his wrists properly at the end of the day? [yes, i had problems shampooing my hair later] who dyes his hair without really knowing what the effect will be? who mixes drinking stuff that shouldn't be drunk together? these are like the latest irresponsible things i did. '(...) the list is as long as my arm!' [quote from 'play festival frenzy'] what-ever.  gonna go and read 'mistrz i małgorzata' by mr. michał bułhakow. actually i saw the play like one year ago. there's no need to read that book since i know what it's about. and there are so many other books to be read...like coelho, zillions of harlequins from lidka, fear streets, poin crimes, dostojewskis, prus, orzeszkowa, sienkiewicz, mickiewicz... ew.  '(...) the list is as long as my arm!'  actually i feel like writing down the kissing scene - how i remember it. dunno why :) ok [preppie group (hunter, jill, will, missy, dawn, miss hockenschmoss.) stand in a line, backs to the audience. the judge (dr. h. urschenfutz) finishes his 'speech' then sits down. miss hockenschmoss turns around, holding bouquet of roses and shawl. missy, dawn and will are to 'react' to everything that happens in that scene, eg. missy and dawn giggle, change looks etc.] miss hockenschmoss: hunter! jill! today's d-day! (everyone turns, she gives flowers to hunter, shawl to jill) jill: oh no! hunter: please, don't let it be... rest of the group: the kissing scene! m. h-s.: (climbs on one of the boxes with help of will) now group, we must be mature and approach this scene with intelligence and taste. will: oh yeah, hunter's gonna get a good taste now. (makes kissing sounds)   m. h-s.: perhaps you would prefer the kissing scene will! (does highly appaling things with her cane/ her lips approaching will) now...(calms) hunter has brought sheila home from the arbor day dance. they stand on the porch, herbie starts to leave, turns back, takes her hand...kisses her gently...then, with increasing passion... (they do what she says but with great disgust. imagine me saying that as a miss hockenschmoss who is said to be a perfectionist :p) hunter: errr, miss hockenschmoss, i have a cold sore coming and i really don't think... m. h-s.: hunter! jill: you know, i was tested for mono just a couple of days ago and... m. h-s.: jill! hunter: but does it have to be her? jill: i met him in kindergarten! h.: our parents play bridge together! ((( talking about cards: d., you know how to play canasta??? ))) j.: what about my reputation? h.: oh please jill, you already kissed half the boys in school! j.: what? h.: the list is as long as my arm! j.: oh yeah? so you've noticed that one name is significantly missing from that list, hun-ter! h.: the fact that i have never dated anyone nicknamed 'hoover lips' (will making sucking noises)is hardly an indication of my amorous experiences! m. h-s.": that's enough! i'm happy to know you both have such a vast background on this subject! the scene should be simple for you. j.: it's not a question of experience! h.: it's all those people/children watching! m. h-s.: (my fav. btw) i don't have time for this. you people chose this play, not me. you want to flush all of your hard work down the drain over a stupid kissing scene...fine!!! (sobs, cries, covers her face in her hands, sounds desperate) h.+j.: sorry...sorry. m. h-s.: (looks up and smiles brightly) thank you! the scene please? [they do the scene - hunter gives jill the flowers, walks away, turns, blabla. but they don't really kiss] not bad...but there's something missing. (about the not-satisfying-kiss) will: movement! m. h-s.: do it again and add a little...movement.  h.+j.: no! m. h-s: (in crechendo - starting calm finishing in her highest pitch) lets try this...the two of you kiss and make it look like the real thing or tomorrow morning, right after the pledge of aligance the principal will announce that the two of you have been namend 'best couple' in a recent yearbook survey...now SUCK FACE!!! [they kiss, kick and 'move'] now that's more like it! [group exits]
