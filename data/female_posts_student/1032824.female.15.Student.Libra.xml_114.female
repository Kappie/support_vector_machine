Tmrw will be fun. seniors and i are going to soul garden for lunch :) that'll be my last time seeing them before i leave for Bali on friday evening! i'm worried. i've sat the aeroplane more than 10 times but..somehow, i'm quite scared..ahh... not to mention, i have altophobia. i've heard from many that Bali is a great place, especially for tanning! i'll also be staying at one of the resorts on some hill, near some plantations. haha. i don't know why but i'm soo excited cos i love the food in the aeroplane! it just tastes special. don't you all agree? or maybe i'm just weird! but yeaa..i love the desert especially! haha. it's like, of the highest quality. but the only thing i find it unfair about is that i'm gonna miss SURVIVOR! sigh.   Okies...good night!  To  NATALIE :  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!!!  *huggles!*
