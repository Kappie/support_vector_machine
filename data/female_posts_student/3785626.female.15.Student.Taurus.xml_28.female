Then I went to French Camp and looked at all the historical stuff. Then ate at French Camp's park and played. Reminded me so much of recess as a little kid. Then after that we went to Ackerman's park and raced around the track. I made it 2nd. Then me and Kristina played batmittonagainst Adriano and Jacqui, we won. Champs!! Then after that we went to Kristina's house and stuff. It was lots of fun. Then we went to church. Then today Tregory came over. :) Happy Cherry. Then after that me and my dad drove around Ackerman. I'm really getting better. I didn't stall as much. Hehehe...
