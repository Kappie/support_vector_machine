I dreamed about eggs last night, precipitated by this new agey short story I read before I conked out.    The story was about a lesbian who laid an egg out of her tear duct, and how it grew and grew, and she felt that it demanded something of her.  She tried eating it, taking care of it, climbing inside it.  Finally she just ended up carrying it around on her back.  The next story is called Sperm.  I am thinking this is some commentary on gender roles, but maybe I'm just too analytical.  But I digress.    The dream I had was that the egg in the story stood alone in this corral in my hometown that the 4-H kids used to use for displaying their prize pigs.  The egg just towered there, all pink an pulsating.  I was just leaning on the fence looking at it.  Then a seam slowly ripped in its crown and a flock of blue herons poured out of the top. Then a swarm of insect-like things that looked like dangling strips of undeveloped film.  They were like a plague of locusts coming to devour the world.  My dad appeared next to me and leaned on the fence.  He quoted some poetry that I do not recall and said that Yes, it was the End.  So I woke up all hot and disturbed and tossed the book into my closet.  When I went back to sleep, I dreamed of a smaller egg, one about the size of a basketball.  I was on some abandoned railroad tracks.  Weeds wound up through the gravel, and the railroad ties were all riddled with cracks.  There was a rickety black train with a count on it, like Count Dracula or Mephistophilis.  I played cards with him for a while, then I was back where I was, and I found the egg.  I pulled it a little ways from the trestle and set it on this old dilapidated wagon that sat in the dirt nearby.  My dad appeared again, and while we watched, the egg ripped open, and out flew a gangly gray bird with rainbows all over it.  My dad said, Hey, that's a pheonix.  And it was, and I suppose that means something, because the pheonix is a magical bird signifying rebirth and rising up from past strife.  So enough about dreams.  I went to the park and played frisbee with my man and our two friends last night.  Got on the swingset, too.  Felt so happy, but I have been here so long.  I thought of all the people I've been to the park with, how my first date my ex husband and I ever had was in the middle of the night on a bench there, and how my first boyfriend and I rolled around in the grass underneath the gazebo.  All the tracks I've made, all the days and loves that are no more.  But I felt good anyway, even though last night was one of many nights, and this love is one of many loves that will have played with my Grateful Dead frisbee and rolled laughing in the grass with me.  Rode around this morning, listening to the radio and singing.  Heard Imagine, and I thought I might cry.  This whole thing in Iraq, the state of the world.  The hooded victims, the greedy mongrels in charge of everything.   It's such a goddamn shame.  It's easy to get so tied up in my little life, and when I remember what's going on, it cuts deep.
