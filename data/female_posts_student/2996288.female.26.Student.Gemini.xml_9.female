For me, I guess that is blue.  But, really, I want to be a person who had red as a favorite color.  Time to go shopping!  Or not.  The girl who is about to ask her parents for several thousand dollars to survive until her next loan disbursement comes in (late August) cannot afford to go buy clothes.  Or to eat, really...!  At least studying is free.  And in great abundance!
