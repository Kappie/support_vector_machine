Then marching wasn't too bad and hmmm, then I went to Chris' tonight. That was fun. Nikki brought the homecoming thing over and she stayed for like, an hour. It was nice. We reminisced haha.   I can't wait to see my first James Bond movie tomorrow! :) I'm quite excited. I'm not sure who's going now or what...but we shall see, we shall see.   Anyway, I am EXHAUSTED. Good night.
