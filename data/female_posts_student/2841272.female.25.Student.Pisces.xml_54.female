One film left me feeling beaten down and dour on the state of man. Even a cliffs notes religious scholar like myself knows that the story of Jesus is suppose to be uplifting, but Gibsons relentless, masochistic film is so brutal and relentless all that reverberates afterwards is the evilness man can enact upon each other. While  Saved!  doesn't completely work as a satire (it finds sympathy for each of its characters) it does work as a religious film, preaching the value love and acceptance. At times funny and thoroughly well acted  Saved!  has the heartlifting optimism, Gibsons punishing film forgot.
