I just can't get the hang of it.  I want sooooo badly in the world to do good, and well with the quiz tommorow and me not understanding how to do LOTS of the stuff scares me.  I WANT to understand, and I am TRYING to get it, but NO ONE understands how difficult it is for me.  I wonder sometimes if anyone has as much trouble learning everything as I do.  I still don't understand my Chem though and well I was studying and practicing and trying to "get it" but tears just kept pouring out of me for a good hour when I was trying to get my chem.  I DON'T need to fail again, that is the last thing I need right now.  It's starting to set in though that it could be a reality.  If my mark drops again in Chem before the final and if I do bad on the final then it probably is possible to fail.  I CAN'T fail chem.  If I fail my life is literally over.  The rest of my life will be ruined because my dreams for the future all depends on if I pass Chem or not.  I honestly don't want to harm myself or kill myself, but sometimes it feels like a better way out.  To just get away from everything.  No one understands how difficult this stuff is for me - I keep trying to do the stuff and like I just can't seem to understand it and I don't know how to practice something I don't understand.  The chem teacher doesn't understand, no one understands.  I feel horrible right now and I am so scared for that quiz tommorow.  I just feel like I put in sooooooooooo much effort into trying to learn the stuff and it feels like all my effort is just going down a drain.  Afterall it's not the effort someone see's, it a mark.  When it comes down to it, what defines me is my stupid marks.  University isn't going to give a fucking piece of shit if someone tried hard.  All that matters is whether you do good or not.  I am so worried.  I want to get into the Biological Sciences eventaully but if my marks in my sciences are weak they probably won't even take a second look at me.  I wonder if this is what all 16 year olds think about or feel like.  I wish I knew, and I wish I had answers.
