Most of them were made so easy that a preschooler could pass them.  I liked that.  I guess the teachers don't want to end up with us next year again.  Friday I worked an LPGA event instead of going to school because I had no finals and it would ahve been stupid to sit there for hours doing nothing.  The event was alright.  Then i went to class night... after I found it of course.  Class night was alright too.  People started to cry, which I don't understand because most are crying because they think they'll never see people again.  First of all, if you're that upset over never seeing someone again, you're going to take the time to see them outside of highschool I guarantee it.  You will keep in touch with those you want to. And second- Murphy's Law- there is no getting away from these people because those that you ABSOLUTLY HATE will find someway of seeing you, you'll run into them somewhere it's bound to happen! Just deal with it!! you may not see them everyday but that's alright. That's better than alright in most cases it's great! I for one am very excited to graduate.  I'll admit there are some things I will miss however I'm ready to move on. I've experienced high school, I've delt with the drama, I've done it, I have regrets but most people do.  I'm ready to move on and start over.  Over these past 4 years I've changed and become close to the person I want to be.  High school's done that for me but there isn't much else I can take from it.  I need something new to learn from.  I'm ready for bigger and better things with new challenges that will help me really become the person I want to be. I will miss a lot of things about NBC- mostly the teachers beause of what I said about your classmates before.  And I have regrets, I admit that, but really who doesn't.  ANd all my regrets, have only made me a better person. They've made me want to better for college and that's what I'm focusing on now.  I can't wait to go.  anyway.... aside from that... the rest of my weekend.... Bill's party was last night and that was TONS of fun!! I had such a good time!! Today was father's day so I did a lot of running around then had family dinner.  that was about it... I graduate tomorrow!! wahoo... ok that's it bye
