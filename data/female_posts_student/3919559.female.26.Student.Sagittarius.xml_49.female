While I wouldn't completely trust the results - some states, like Delaware, have no polling data from 2004, and their prediction is based only on the 2000 election - it is a better indicator than the national horserace polls, which are basically meaningless in predicting who will win.  Those polls are only useful for looking generally at trends that might affect the few states whose electoral votes are in play.  If we learned anything from four years ago (although it's something we all knew already), the candidate with the most electoral votes wins.  The popular vote is meaningless, and its the state-by-state battles that matter.
