But, the other day, I was in Chinatown and bought one for old times sake. And, dude, my love affair with the pineapple bun was rekindled.   I ended up buying 8 buns for $4.00 (@ $0.50 a bun) and brought them back to Bard. I am ashamed to admit this, but the buns didn't last long. Despite their smooshed and sticky disposition, I consumed them pretty quickly. I think I'm going to have to make another trip to Canal to buy some more.
