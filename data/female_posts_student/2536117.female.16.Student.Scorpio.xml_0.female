OHOH i also STOLE (according to nazreney) pictures of the ADORABLE eliana, drapy's GORGEOUS ickle SWEETHEART of a baby, (apologise for the crapness of the quality, but taking a picture of a picture really isn't advisable unless in UNIQUE and SPECIAL cases...which this one undoubtedly was) but i thought it inappropriate to post those up on the internet, what with all the freakay PAEDOPHILES around... and no i don't mean farah. anyhoo, if you want a copy to KEEP for YOUR VERY OWN SELF, (yes, you can cut out and stick it on your wall if necessary - wow, we really ARE rather paedophilic), emailey moi or just ask and once i've verified that you're a tiffinian (paedophile), shall sendy them asap with my 'fastest fingers of the west', as dubbed by nazrene. (although technically, she deserves that title, her fingers are just like WHOOOSH WOAH WOAH BLURS!)  OH OH OH and also managed to clicky away and niftily get a photo of chris...YES THE 11 YEAR OLD JOHNNY DEPP IMPRESSION DUDE, PURE GENIUS - god it's THE BEST!! but likewise, didn't want thousands of adoring johnny depp fans following him around and demanding that he "do it again"! wait, that was us. and yes farah, you can have a copy of your beloved boy.  must also apologise for any offensive captionning, i know that frankie shall not be best pleased with the title 'le frank' - in fact, i think i may be forced to change it, or suffer the very DIRE consequences of frankie's WRATH.  anyhoo, enjoy these little gems my fellow 11w-elites (and although we're very much THE BEST, i meant that in an 'e-lights', we're just SO FAR OUT, WE'RE OUT OF THIS WORLD kinda way...damn i make no sense.)  much love xxx
