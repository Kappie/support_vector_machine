Well in a week my mom, Emily, and Daniel will leave from where they are to head up to the beach, and my dad and I will meet them there.  Well today at lunch my dad said he was in the mood to buy a new car, which is weird because he's all about saving money for us to go to college and stuff.  He said he wanted a new car for him or to buy a new van with more room for my mom.  Then he said if it's did cost too much money we could rent a van or something that he'd probably never buy.  We'd drive it up to the beach and surprise my mom.  The reason the van wouldn't work as well is because she has our van with her and wouldn't believe we'd buy another without trading hers in.  If they rented Hummers and it didn't cost too much for gas my dad said we'd have gotten that to drive up there.  He also said that when my mom asked whose it was he'd just tell us he bought it for me.  Which would never happen because I don't drive.  I think tonight after the car places close we're gonna go look at vans and stuff.  My dad just doesn't like people looking over his shoulder and calling him up to ask if he's made a decision.  This way if we go tonight and see something we like we can go back when the place is open.  I'd also like to let Veronica know that I'm so happy for her.  Jealous but happy.  Oh, and at least you have people comment even if you don't really know them.  I have you and Danny.  So if anyone is bored enough to read this please comment on it.  I won't beg, but pretty please.
