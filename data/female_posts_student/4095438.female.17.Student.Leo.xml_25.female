If anything, I just feel disturbed by the knowledge that there are 2 Level III and 4 Level II  urlLink sex offenders  in my area. What am I supposed to do with this information? Does anyone think that by knowing what street these people live on and perusing personal details and a photo, that I am supposed to save myself from the unimaginable?   The assumption is that these people have served their time for the crime (what does "indecent liberties" mean anyway?); they're either fit to be in the community or they're not. Is feeding fear really the way to go about reintegrating them into society? Or, is it the American way to punish without opportunity for rehabilitation?   In one known case, the assertion that the sex offender is a danger to society is certainly questionable. The  urlLink story  of Mary Letourneau is a bizarre one - she started a relationship with a then-12-year-old boy when she was a 34 yo school teacher and they had 2 children together (!) before she was tried for statutory rape and given a suspended sentence. Unable to resist seeing him again, they were caught in a car together and she served 7 1/2 years in prison. Now, I would argue that someone like Mary doesn't deserve to be branded for life on a website accessible to anyone and everyone in the entire world. The relationship was entirely consensual but she broke the law and she did her time in prison for it. Does she not deserve a second chance at a normal life?  In other news, I've found yet another  urlLink strike  against Seattle beaches; one I  urlLink visited  not a few weeks ago.
