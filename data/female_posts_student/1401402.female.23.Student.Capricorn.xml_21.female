I dont watch tv very much, unlike some coach potatoe friends of mines, who are always over at my house getting high and munching up all my junk food. What a friend huh? Its cool tho I dont mind because I'm the nice one LoL. I wonder if any of my shows fit any of your categories? Sunday Nite - Charmed on WB channel 20 @ 8pm. A show about three powerful sister's who are witches. Who try to protect the world and vanish all the demons. The first sister has the ability to freeze objects, the second sister could preminish things, and the third sister could move objects. Humm, If I could choose one super power it would have to be freezing things. I can rob a bank and be so rich only god knows what on earth I would do with all that money. I can strip people down in public. I can do so many things to so many people you wouldnt even know.  Monday Nite - Mr. Personality on channel 2 @ 9pm. A bachelorette looking for true love. She wont depends among the charm but better yet, she wants to reveal their inner beauty inside out. Therefore the bachelor (s) would wear a colored mask, try to persuade and win her heart. The bachelorette who has the power to decided who or which gets to stay or must be eliminated.  Wednesday Nite - Dawson Creeks on WB channel 20 @ 8pm. The show started out since 1998 and next wed. would be the very last episode ever. Damn I'm getting all upset because thats my favorite show. It reminds me so much about life, friendship, love, passion, heartbreak, betrayal, trust, education, drama and etc... This show makes me stop to think of Why do we forget the bad times so quickly? Maybe because we've learned to forgive and forget. Memories are the best of tymes and decisions are made clearly. Its true what they say about time. A min its yours and the world seems like yours forever with a simple smile. The next, its playing tricks on you and it fakes out on you rite before your eyes.  Friday Nite - Family Bussiness on Showtime Late Night on channel 14 @ 11:30pm A story about a guy name Adam who is a producer, director, performer in the adult films industries. Adult entertainer business thats what I've should have said. His films are called Seymore Butts. His a hottie and also looking for that special someone. His always going on dates with women he fines online. But its pretty sad that hasnt find that special someone yet because most women doesnt appreciated what Adams does for living. If ya asked me i'll probably freaked out the moment he tells me his in the adult industries. I wonder how many people found love and how many just gave up like me? i've used to chat online and end up falling for strangers but one day I realized that i'm just hurting myself by doing that. So I've disconcerted myself out of the dating online thingy. Its cool tho, what ever comes comes. When its time I'll meet that Mr. Rite. But for now let me just enjoy life as it is. I'm free and thats FREEDOM. On my spear time, I would watch Thai movies, play with Alyssia, or read romance novel. I think reading is a sign of intelligence. Or watch Food TV! Yeah yeah, the food network is awesome. Molto Mario and Emeril Live are the best cheft that I've like so far.
