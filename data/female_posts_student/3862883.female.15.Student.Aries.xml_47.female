He does have the right it judg him because I believe everyone is entitled to their own oppion about someone. Their oppion may change as time goes on, but people get a first impression of someone and then judges them. I'm sure Willard did judge Kurtz from what he knew and read about him. That way at least he had some idea of him. I did judge Kurtz when I first heard about him based on only what I knew. I may not have the right, but I do have the right to my own oppion of what I think of him. From what I knew I juged him as a man who has gone insane and lost his mind. My oppion of him never changed from what I saw him and read about him.
