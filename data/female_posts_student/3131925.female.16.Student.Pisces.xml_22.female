Last night I went to silver strand with carlye and jessie and for awhile we just chilled at jetty surf not really knowin what to do, then carlye and i realized we both had 10 bucks, so we got this guy to buy us some "stuff" and we went to this house their builing looking over the harbor and it was me carlye and shantel since jessie had summer school. Then we decided to see who all was at jetty surf and all the guys were gone so we walked to the beach and drank more and did cartwheels n stuff in our bras lol and carlye ran around while some sketchy person sat kinda far away from us. then we walked back and now all the strand guys were going to the beach but matty said a lot fo cops were gonna be on strand so shantel and i went to uncle rays..had some fun there lol, talked about furniture and shelves with memory lol, then how bad it would suck if you've never seen what you really looked like lol. Then after that it was almost 12 so I went back to Jessie's who of course was talking to allen so I got my shit and went into Jakes room and passed out. then 2 hours later jessie wakes me up and tells me carlye's at jetty surf cafe and can hardly walk and keeps passing out..and then decker comes in and laughs at me lol(random) so i'm like yeah ok w/e and pass back out, then jessie wakes me up and i go into her room and pass back out while carlye's sick in the bathroom. jessie had to get up at 6 in the fucking morning and she turned on her brightest damn light so i was awake the whole time, then i passed back out lol YET AGAIN and woke up to jessie gone but carlye coming in asking if she could lay next to me and how she was still drunk lol. So in all it was an interesting night, i forgot about clint and how sweet he's being at the momento, which isn't sweet at all so it was fun, and now it's the weekend..
