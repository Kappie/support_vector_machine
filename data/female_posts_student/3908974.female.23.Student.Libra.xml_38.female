My man's acting all weird today, and I hope it's nothing to do with me and how gooey I've been of late.  I guess I should be more careful what I say.  I forget how things can become distorted when they come out of my mouth, how threatening even the most unassuming admission of love can be.  Or maybe it's something else entirely.  I'm just afraid I might have screwed this up somehow, me and my big mouth.  Or maybe it's just me and my big ego, thinking obviously everything relates back to me.  Christ I am being neurotic.  Must stop now.  So fifteen minutes to go, and in my typical fashion, I am tapping away at the computer keys.  This workday has been less than productive.  I think I did one single work related thing.  The rest of my time on the clock has been spent fooling around, deep in conversation, deep in writing letters on e-mail.  I got this long letter from another old friend of my roommate's, one I really have forged a strange bond with over the past year.  I really have bogarted my roommate's friends, and though I resisted becoming entrenched in her social circle at first, I have pretty much become one of them.  Anyway, the guy calls me Cookie, which I find vaguely insulting and heartwarming at the same time, and I think if he lived up here, we'd hang out a lot.  He's an uber-nerd.  (Why can't I meet more of those?  I know they're around.)  People said he had a thing for me, but I'm positive there's nothing there.  Just the usual dose of complication arising from coed friendships.    But then again, I'm awfully dense about men...Actually, I am pretty dense about many many things.  Anyway, in my brief stint at actually doing my job today, I drove about campus and listened to bad rock and roll.  Billy Idol.  (Nice day for a white wedding.) Queen.  (Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round!)  So I would be in high spirits, but for the weird atmosphere surrounding my man, with whom I am going to make a conscious effort to be less gooey with.  Okay.  I'm outta here!  Rock and Roll!
