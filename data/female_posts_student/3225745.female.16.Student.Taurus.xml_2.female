He disclosed something about me that i wish he hadnt. now i know almost everyone there knew..but the guys that didnt know didnt have to.  I thought derek was a nice guy.  but he used that against me and that was just wrong.  i hadnt even done anything to him.  and just so those who know about the "church incident", it wasnt that i needed DEREK to be there persay.  I needed someone there because the girls at FBC dont like me because i dont have sex all the time or drink.  and im sorry if i seem bitchy right now maybe i should listen to matt and just get laid.  well im not going to do that but anyway.  i needed to get that off my chest. im sorry.
