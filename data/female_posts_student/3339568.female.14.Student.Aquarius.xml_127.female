Embaressingly funnny. Extreamley embaressing. Bates and the tutor group "oooing" and shannon making up stupid chants and screaming things down the corridor. God, when will they get ova it?! Haha. Tho i must admit it was quite hilarious. Altho i was extreamley embaressed at the same time!! I was like BRIGHT RED!!!! The day has also been sad. I can't reveal details becuase Annie swore me to secrecy. But also Annie is gonna leave 4 St.Andrews at the end of the year, and that is totally sad!! :( But the worst and most unfair part of it is the bit i can't tell. But trust me its bad. Oh i'm so frustrated. Poor poor annie. Science was a total bludge. Because we both couldnt b bothered 2 do any work, and Annie didnt come into the class until near the end and we had 2 console her, and mel was laughing at mi mank goanna fossil drawing which was extreamley hilarious, i soooo could not be bothered 2 do work, i just cant wait till 2nite! It's gonna be fun, in more ways than one! And no that was NOT a hint, 4 all u dirty minded people out there who hav been hassling me 2day!! I am excited because...oops sorry, secret!! Mwhahaha...Anika knows! Hehe, secrets r fun. Well if they are harmless of course. Bt these secrets r generally harmless. I remember ages ago when I used 2 haveaaaaalll these secrets bout people at church and I couldnt tell, and one time i got totally stressed out bout it becuase mel wanted 2 know sumthing and i couldnt tell her 4 a very good reason and it got all very ugly!! Hhe, its so cute because there is this guy who likes Jess called Jack, and hes really sweet, because he calls her every night, and he asked her 2 the movies, his shout, and jess says its not a date. but we all say it is! Guys, I need your opinion on this one please!! Is it a date or not? I think it could be. But y'know it could also not. Because I went out 2 coffee with luke like twice or sumthin b4 we started going out and it wasnt a date. But yeh, i bet that Jack guy likes her anyway. He's sposed 2 be hot as well. mayb he has shaggy hair? Shaggy hair is hot! hot hot hot.... Even jess's drama teacher thinks its a date, gem and jess were discussing it, and she walks past, and just goes. "It's a date!" and then keeps on walking! Haha. How random and funny! Argh! So excited bout 2nite! And world cafe!! hehehehe Mwahahaha, life's good again!! Maybe its becuase ive caught up on sleep! Ok maybe ill go and finish this post and then read sum other peoples blogs!! yay yay! Renata STILL isnt here! shes like 15mins late! Eh'xcellent! Blogging off, beth
