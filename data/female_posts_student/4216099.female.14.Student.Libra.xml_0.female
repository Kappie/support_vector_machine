" Kisses  are never safe when residue of old  love  is left how could I feel  lesser  when someone  better  walks around  waiting  for you to call out As your cold hand  grasps  mine I feel unright and  privileged  to be able to look in your  eyes  same chemical as stars Deformed fingers  leave  trails of  hearts  in writing could  three  words be the  end  to births only meaning  Crying  to sleep is my  remedy  urgently trying to stand on broken confused legs Am I looking for  reasons  not to be happy  emotions  catch up with me I'm  too fast  for them.."
