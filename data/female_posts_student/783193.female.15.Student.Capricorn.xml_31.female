That's my hunk. He's such a hottie.  urlLink http://www.imaginationatwork.com/Imagine?_nolivecache=20030212_004301010_76716259_lscid=73636210  This is the one I made for her. She gets to reuse her Christmas present. Sad, I know. Nothing much happening. We're going to Disneyland fo' sho' now. Or fo' shizzle, my nizzle, according to Derek. I can't wait. We're to go in May, but we've started a fundraiser, kind of sort of. We had to give our brochure things back because they weren't approved, and we're selling Otis Spunkmeyer cookies at the moment for regular school. I guess they didn't want so many monies (moan-eez) going everywhere at once at one time. Chris Chien's birthday today- Jessica was intent on singing Happy Birthday to him, but I stopped the madness. Chapter test in Giles.. it wasn't hard. Played Speed with Jessica afterwards.. I win! I always win! Yeah. As I said, nothing much happening. Bounced around at Cissy's house some more. Mixed more drinks. Went pee, like, twelve times since then. Good stuff.Coming soon: Lindsay may be starting a super-duper journal/blogger/diary too. Is this a trend, or what?
