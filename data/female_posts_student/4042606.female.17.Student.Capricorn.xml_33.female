That wasn't the case because I was on my computer all night IMing people and posting random crap that shouldn't have been posted. Hence that long section about how much I hate people. Right now, I have a horrible headache and I want to sleep. When I was about to go to bed a spider fell off the ceiling and onto my arm. It set me off balance, because, I was freaked out and fell on my bed. Luckly I fell asleep.  Anyway, Jackie was right last night. Part 3 of the story A Figure In October will not be posted because I haven't finished yet. I have to write a couple more pages then I will post it. Right now though, I am not really in the mood to do anything. I really had to force myself to even write this. I just barely woke up too.
