All of a sudden I see some kid in the middle of Broad Street, riding on a scooter right on the double yellow line, fool! YOU ARE GOING TO GET RUN OVER, that would suck. I got to school early so Xu could copy some of my notes. I partied it up in the L.I.B. with Xu, Marcoux, AG, Shaunda, and ECBC. It was such good times. I kept laughing about the Less Than Jake concert with Marcoux. See, we both knew we were going to be there, but we never found each other. Cell phones didn't work inside the club, either. So I go outside, see that she called, and then try to call her back. I start to leave a message about who knows what, then I don't know what to say, so I said, "And I want you to know, I love you very much!" I HAD NO WORDS, THAT'S WHAT I SAID! I wasn't high/drunk either, shit man, I know that's what you were thinking. I really just said that, it's only funny cause I don't know Olivia that well, but we're working on it. EC said something so funny, but I can't remember it now. What was it? My mind is completely GONE, it's sad. The English exam was aight. Then I went to study with Chels and Kristen. GOOD TIMES. We didn't study though, literally we studied for 10 minutes. Chelsea fed us these microwavable White Castle burgers, they weren't as bad as I would have guessed actually. Then we had to go to the library so Chelsea could copy Kristen's notes before she had to go home. Kaddy drove. They told me funny stories, it was great. On the way back, it had started to rain, we had to run to the car. We got in and Kristen says, "It smells like wet dog." Chelsea cooly replies, "Katherine." OOOH It was hilarious! Those kids are awesome. Then Chelsea and I had this really long conversation about bras and Victoria's Secret. She just doesn't understand, it's not easy or enjoyable to be bra shopping for me. I explained to her about, "The thick bra straps that literally fall off your shoulder they're so wide and the 15 clasps up the back!" IT was great! Good times. I went on a walk with my mom and the dog today. Family-it's so messed up. My mom has like a crick in her back and can't make turns and stuff. So the dog, right before we get home, stops in front of this house with people on the porch, and starts to take a shit. Dog, I hate you! I yelled at him and told him he was bad. He bowed his head in shame, everybody watched him. Then my mom is walking back with his bag of shit in one hand, not turning any part of her body cause of her crick, oh I wish you had been there. I'm so tired. I REALLY need to study for USH, I want to make Mr. O proud!
