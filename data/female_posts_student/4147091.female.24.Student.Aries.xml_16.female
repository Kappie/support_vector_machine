However, I woke up sick.  And I"m a sucker for being taken care of when I"m sick.  And theres no one to take care of me.  Although my best friend did offer to take me to the emergency room.  Ahh...no.  Sitting in a noisy hospital room waiting to be told I have the flu is not my kind of way to spend a Saturday.  I"ll veg and reminse about all the times I've been sick while living alone before.  And survived.  Although I'd almost give my leg arm to have my exboyfriend here now to take care of me.  He diligently woke me every 4 hours while I was living in Dublin to make me drink water and to make sure I hadn't developed some rare Irish sickness.  I had never been so sick in my whole life.  And I am eternally grateful to him for helping me.  I"m sure I would have accepted a marriage proposal after that.  But I digress...  I busted out and bought the dvd to the 46664 concert I went to in Cape Town last Nov.  I"ve never spent so much on a single dvd.  And the worst part, i can't find myself!  Not that we had the greatest view.  But somewhere in the back of my mind I was sure that I was on it...somewhere and Bono would see it and hunt me down...wait....I"m getting carried away...nonethelsss, I didn't see myself or the other 6 Canadians I went with.  And I must mention my deep unhappiness with the new commerical for the prequeal to the Exorcist.  I probably don't need to explain what an absolutly frightening movie the original is.  And this new one, although seems much less on the scarey side, is conjuring up a bunch of unpleasant images that I must deal with....here...alone.  I saw one at 10am!  Who puts that commerical on at 10am?  Little children are watching that!  Are we trying to push the next generation over the edge and into oblivion?  Or maybe the rest of the world doesn't find it as frightening as I do.  So I sit here on this oddly sunny Saturday afternoon awaiting a promising thunder and lightening storm.  I get cheated by mother nature everytime we have a storm.  I"m usually asleep and I miss it.  However, I'm determined to sit alone and watch it this time.  I find storms an oddly spiritual event (being so very non spiritual myself).  The electricity in the air clears me and recharges my batteries.
