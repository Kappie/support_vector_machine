Hahaha... in e end.. we catergories ourselves into 2 kind of person : Dear, Adrian Tan -- A Person who got to buy e stuff on e spot... espcially when he tried the thing, coz he thinks that he will nt go bck n try e thing again. So is, think now, buy now type. Dear, Apel Yap -- A Person who thinks trying =  no need spend $$, Y cannot? Will think a couple of day after spotting a item.. will buy it when time's n $$'s ripe.... Gd way to save $$.. (Hahaha....)   So, that's y coz of our 2 diff concepts.. we walked in n out of e shop.. thinking "To buy or nt to buy" e tamagotchi... hahaha, but in e end... too lei che lar.... Apel meimei gave up.. haha, lazy to think that much.. so BUY ba~ ( But horz, only this time.. coz like i say, if 1 of us spent alot, the other must SAVE!
