Last night while talking  to Taylor who is the son of the lady that very gracefuly offered to  host us while in town, the topic of white supremacy came up.   Today, the Arian Nations were holding their annual White Power parade  in downtown.  Needless to say I headed that way this morning to  participate in history in the making.  I had mental images of KKK  hodded people and imagined hundreds of hateful people parading through  the streets of this beautiful city.  I feared for my safety, but  my curiosity was bigger than my fears.  As we arrived there, there  were dozens of police officers and both of the main streets were  blocked off to trafic.  We stood a block away from where they were  marching and saw all 20 members of the Arian Nations congregation, most  of which are well beyond 65 years of age ridicule themselves in front  of dozens of very angry citizens protesting their mere presence.   Up on an old bit up white truck, was Richard Buttler himself, equiped  with wheel chair and oxygen tank.   Every time they chanted  "White Power!" the general public response was, "Shut up and GO  HOOOME!!"  This is one of the most incredible displays I've seen  in my life.  Across the street from where we were standing, there  where at least three dozen riot police officers in full gear awaiting  further instructions.  They took over the whole street and  proceded to load up into unmarked white cars that where lined up, four  policemen and policewomen per car plus two suburbans with officers  hanging in both sides of the cars.  There were also an Explosive  Disarming Unit and an Emergency Response vehicle along side fire trucks  with their hosses set to disperse any riot that may break out.  I  was a witness to all this on July 17, 2004.
