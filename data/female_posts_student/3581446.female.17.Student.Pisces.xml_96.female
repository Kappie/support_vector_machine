When people ask that, they don't literally mean, « What is the meaning of life? », they mean « What is the meaning of human life? », or perhaps even more specifically, « What is the meaning of my life? ». And by this we mean, am I stuck in a meaningless, absurd, Camusian universe, where all I can do is muddle through my sisyphean struggle? Or am I in the world of traditional religion, where I have meaning, and purpose, and rules by which I ought to live my life?  Most people find a middle-ground between these two positions- they sort of adopt a quasi-religious "God's in his heaven and all's right with the world" stance, where they believe in a God somewhere out there, but they don't bother to learn about him or rigorously evaluate their own actions to see if they are doing something contrary to His will. They don't pray or study, they just have this sort of passive belief and assume that their actions are more or less up to God's standards.   Then, there are pantheists and demi-atheists who, while disavowing a belief in God, nevertheless live by -- normally vague -- moral principles and derive what meaning they can by relationships with friends and loved ones, and by pursuing things they desire. Of course, there are more sophisticated breeds like Buddhists, who have pretty specific principles and disapprove of attachments to family, friends or material things, or Confucians (and their relative western equivilents) who emphasize social order, respecting authority, and relationships with family and friends.   On the two extremes are the devout and the hardcore atheists. Hardcore atheists aknowledge the camusian nature of our universe, and have resolved themselves to accept it- in all its meaninglessness, absurdity, and existential despair.   The devout, on the other hand, have taken the opposite approach and applied themselves vigorously to pursuing God, and as a result have made a thorough study of their religion's principles and prochedures, and have undertaken to implement them and, when possible, comitt them to heart.   In any case, of all these, could we say any were the meaning of life? We can eliminate harcore atheism, because it indeed leaves us in a state of meaninglessness- and demi-atheism and the 'easygoing religious' type only seem to go halfway, particuliarly the easygoing.   Full meaning can only be found in devoutness. Its opposite is the meaningless of hardcore atheism, and demi-atheism or the easygoing life only possess meaning in the sense that they resemble to that degree devoutness. Therefore, the meaning of life must be devoutness.  -Ian
