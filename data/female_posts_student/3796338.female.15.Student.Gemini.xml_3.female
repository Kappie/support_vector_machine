Two nights ago I woke up at 2 IN THE MORNING BECAUSE THE ASSHOLES BESIDE US HAD TO LIGHT OFF BOTTLE ROCKETS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!!! I couldn't go back to sleep.... I'm calling the cops. I came back from Island Park, and I was in and around my house for 2 MINUTES AND FIREWORKS ALMOST HIT MY HOUSE 3 TIMES!!!! That's rediculous!!! If they don't stop by 11, I WILL CALL THE COPS!!!   YOU HEAR THAT YOU JACKASSES!!!! QUIT LIGHTING OFF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS AT TWO IN THE MORNING!!! I GOTTA WORK YOU KNOW!!! I'M GONNA GET YOUR PUNK ASSES IN JAIL!!!   Okay, enough flarring for now, I will stop.... >.> bye peoplez....
