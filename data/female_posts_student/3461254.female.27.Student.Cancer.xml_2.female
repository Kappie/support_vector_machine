It's sort of like "Space madness" from Ren  Stimpy.  I just might eat the soap...  Here's a joke you'll only get if you're a med student who games (oh wait, Jason and I are the only med students who game):  How do you know if a med student games?  She has a d6 that she's spinning around to try to figure out if the numbers correspond to the chambers of the heart (in filling order, and order in space).  I did this for 15 minutes before giving up, because the heart isn't shaped like a d6.  Maybe I can try a d8!
