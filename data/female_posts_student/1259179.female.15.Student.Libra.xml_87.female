My family and I are going to Toronto for 3 days, at my brother Mike.  Mom will be joining us.  We will have a great time, like usual.  Marthe, my sister-in-law, is an amazing host and cook.  She is so organized and runs her house with perfection.  So until I see you again,  take a moment and reflect about why we celebrate this AWESOME Holiday... Here is a hint, it has nothing to do with bunnies and Chocolates...  If you need a hint.... Read  ~ John 3:16 ~ in a bible.  So on this ...........Be Good and God Bless \o/
