I'm really sick of the bull shit I'm putting myself through. I think I've changed alot in the past year, not for the good but not for the bad either, IDK. It's just different so in honor of my "Growing up" I'll fill out a new quizy thingy. Wait as cory as it sounds I'm not gonna "Grow up" I made a prommise (Here's the corny/retarded part) to Simple Plan at the Skate Fest that I would never grow up and I intend to stick with it! Ya ya, okay yell at the computer think "WTF! What a dumb ass....!" okay I can handle it..... here goes.....  1) Where do you see yourself in 5 years?: Uh...... ending an awesome summer road trip to California and Preping for College or somthin. 2) Name all your favorite bands: That's crazy! there is way toooooo many!

M=MXPX-Anything-right now I have 'Everything sucks' in my head N=No Doubt-Anything-'Spiderwebs' O=The Offspring-'Pretty Fly for a white guy'-so funny! P=Papa Roch-I forget  Q=QQQ  uhhhh mabey Queen's of the stone age- have to be in the right mood R=Reset-anything-'My Dream and I' S=Simple Plan- uh all of them but to narrow it down....right now I'm feeling 'meet you there' T=Trapt-'headstrong' U=The Used- A couple-'The Taste of Ink'+'Burried Myself Alive' V= W=Weezer- 'Hash Pipe' X= Y=Yellowcard-'Way Away' Z=Zebrahead-Anything I'm at a loss.... lol.... the retard in me came out.....
