Although this has yet to be confirmed I have no doubts that this will be a hot new thing for the Boys.  I think that the Backstreet Boys will prove to the critics as they always have that just because they haven't been around for a while that means that they can't start over again. Early next year the boys are planning a world wide tour of small and intimate venues so that they can get reaquainted with their fans.      There have also been rumors floating around that Brian will bring his wife and 1.5 year old son Baylee with them but it will only be at certain places for fear that it may be too much for Leighanne and the baby. Leighanne has stated that she and Brian want baby Baylee to know what his daddy does for a living.      Everyone seems to think that because the Backstreet Boys haven't been in touch with their fans that it means that the Backstreet Boys are over but in reality the Backstreet Boys have a new album coming out in October. :)
