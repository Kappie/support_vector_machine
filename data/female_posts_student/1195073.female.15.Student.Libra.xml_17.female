Then, we went to the Great Dragon for lunch, and then Hy-Vee.  I watched "Signs," but I wasn't really paying too much attention to it, though.  Oh well, I will watch it again later.  I have to go to a baby shower tomorrow.  I was put in charge of games.  Oh boy.  I am thinking of making one where I will take assorted types of baby food, peel the label off, and pass the little jars of baby food around, then, people have to taste them and try to recognize what type they are, the person who gets the most correct wins.  I don't know what other ones to do.  Maybe I will look around on-line.    Friday was sh!t.  A lot of people were pissing me off, plus, I didn't feel well.  I barfed Thursday night.  It was nasty!!!  I popped some capillaries in my face while I was at it, as well.  It didn't hurt, though, and I was actually quite surprised at that.  Gosh, it was all chunky and this really nasty shade of brownish-yellow.  It looked like that creamed corn or whatever it's called.  I will never eat that stuff again, even though that's not what caused it 'cause I didn't eat that stuff on Thursday....  or any day in the last few months for that matter.  Wednesday was.................  to be quite honest, I don't really remember Wednesday.  Same goes for Monday and Tuesday.  We started materials and processes or MAP, as I like to refer to it.  Mr. Lund is pretty scary, but we are doing pottery, so I think I can forget my Mr. Lund-o-phobia for a while to focus on my pot (as in my POT, as in short for POTTERY, not the drug, just thought I'd clear that up).  molly
