Anyway i wasn't trying to win, i was just saying that laurel betrayed me because she was all "steve be funnier." thats it. No "winning" involved. There now i'm done and i'll blog about this no longer, because its stupid and it doesn't deserve as much time as i have devoted to joking about it. hahaha, oh me and my lack of life, wooo
