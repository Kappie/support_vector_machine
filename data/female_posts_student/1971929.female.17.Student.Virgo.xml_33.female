After Tim and I broke up Lucas and I went out, and then went out again, and again. Though we never officially said we were an item, everyone started to call me Lucas' girlfriend and Lucas my boyfriend, so we just decided not to correct them anymore. We went out from December 2003 to the end of May 2004, so that's a good... five and a half months. Lucas is talked about on the main page so you can check out what happened to this relationship there. Check the posts for May 2004.
