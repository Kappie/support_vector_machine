The hotel doesn`t charge for internet if you are staying here!!!  Second, French people are really skinny here.  Like, seriously, I`m chubby here.  Dead serious.  Ok, now close your mouth.  Third, the people smell terrible.  There is no deoderant.  Well, there is, they just don`t embrace the universal "lets not knock each other out with our bo" concept.  Such a shame.  Ok, now for a little activity.  Look at your keyboard.  Find the "a."   Now move it to where the "q" is.  Switch the "w" and "z" and the "m" and ":."   Now you can`t just type a "."  Nope, now you choose shift semi-colon.  Then add a whole bunch of french characters, such as è, à, ù and ç, and you cqn imagine something close to the thing I`m typing on.  It sucks.  Majorly.  Well, tomorrow I`m off to Toulon, the city my sister lived in for a year.  It should be...interesting to say the least.  Again, don`t know if I`ll be back, but I`ll try.  After Toulon, it`s the night train to Italy.    I`m going to go eat dinner...it`s a 7 hour time difference here, so don`t think that I always eat so early.  Bye bye!!
