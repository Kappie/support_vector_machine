I think it all has to do with figuring out who you are and what you want...  It reminded me of a conversation I had with my barber Bob a few days ago.  He was telling some metaphorical story, something like "So you start in Florida and you want to go to San Francisco, but after a little while, you think, 'Eh, San Francisco is kinda far, how about Las Vegas?,' but then after a bit you go 'Oh, Vegas is kinda far also, how about Texas?'"  Naturally, I interpreted the moral of the story to be  Don't settle for anything less than what you want  (I mean, come on,  Texas ?).  But apparently, the moral was that  you can always change your mind .  He started talking about how people who had set goals and pursued goals somehow ended up happier, even if they changed what they were pursuing.  The more I think about it, the more I think its true.  It feels like we're pressured to know who we are come senior year, and then market that to colleges, and relatives, and everyone.  This seems to get everyone all freaked out about making the  wrong  decision.  But I guess what Bob was saying is that you are allowed to change your mind, but you will miss opportunities if you don't pursue anything for fear of pursuing the wrong thing.  Anyone agree?  G'night.
