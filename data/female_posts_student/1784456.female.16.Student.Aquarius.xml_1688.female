That would explain why Lifehouse music is booming out of the house, the haze of insence smoke and the lack of lights. Worth a try, but nothing's gonna save us. Woohoo for monotonous living! Actually... it's crap, but nevermind my life changes but working life seems to ...not. I think I'm just gonna have to buy a pair of tye dye thongs from Izzy and wear them over my trousers. No one would notice though, for me wierd is normal. Ahhhh! Anyway, stuff has happened. Like... I've become friends with one of my brothers friends so he's kind of 'warning' me not to be, and destroying a picture of the guy he sent to me. Hehe, tis quite funny really. Apart from the whole locking the front door, not letting me out thing. Ah well.
