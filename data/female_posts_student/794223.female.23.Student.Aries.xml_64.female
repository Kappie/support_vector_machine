How you can be excited, confused, surprised, and yet not surprised at the same time is beyond me...but that's how I feel.  I'm not surprised because I felt that I had a decent chance of passing this round; the real decision will come from Brazil, however--and they notoriously prefer dissertation candidates for this research grant.  I am surprised due to the timing, mainly because any thoughts about the Fulbright or the possibility of receiving it have been the farthest thing from my mind as of late.  Up until now I really haven't even considered it to be a possibility, and have mainly concentrated on either 2 years in Cuba or starting Grad School in August.  The problem with these things is that if you happen to be named as an alternate, there's a chance that you might not know the final result until late summer or early fall.  That could seriously screw up graduate school plans, although I'm fairly certain that Tulane would let me either defer for a year, or start a semester and then leave mid-year for Brazil.  We'll just have to wait and see; this entire spring is going to be nothing but a waiting game, on more levels than one.  Aunt Rite called me today and asked me not to come up for Brandi's surgery on Wednesday; as much as I would love to be there with her, practically I can understand that me being there would simply add more stress to an already stressful scenario.  Instead, she asked me to wait until Brandi had a more concrete schedule with radiation; that's when she and Brandi are really going to need me.  I'm actually ok with this; I'd rather be there when they truly need my presence.  In addition, I have to prepare for the presentation of my thesis on the 14th and 15th, and get the house ready in time for our out-of-the-country guest; the student Latin American Studies Conference is coming up, and I haven't even had time to give it a second thought.  Another surprise in the mail recently: I've been invited to become a memeber of  urlLink Phi Beta Kappa --apparently the oldest and most prestigious honor's society in existence.  I had no idea what it was (I'm quite clueless when it comes to Greek organizations); Mimi and Opa had to explain it to me.  They seemed very familiar with it, and insisted that I join (as indicated by their willing to spot me the application fee, which is not exactly cheap).  I'm still a bit confused at to what purpose this organization actually serves other than the mere idea of being a member; the other 2 honor societies I'm in stress community service in addition to being a part of their organizations.  Oh well.  Apparently this is something quite worthy, so I feel honored.  They do have a nomination form for an outstanding professor, so I intend to take advantage of that .  On the political front...thank goodness that they are finally ordering an independent council.  We definitely need to get to the bottom of all this.
