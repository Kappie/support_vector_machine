Anyways, we stayed in this town for quite a while and visited the lakefront, where the Ontario River and Lake Ontario meet, took a ride in a horsedrawn carriage through the town, and walked around for a bit downtown. It was very cool. After leaving Niagara-On-The-Lake, we went to the Niagara Parks Botanical Gardens and walked around. That was very cool. The plants and flowers are so much bigger and more colorful there than around here. I got a bunch of good pictures in the gardens if you're interested in looking at my albums on my profile. Anyways, after that we came back to our hotel room and headed back out to dinner at a place called Murphy's in the town we were staying in on the harbor. That was good food. Then we drove by the falls again when it was dark. They had lights projecting on them that looked pretty neat - the water droplets broke the white light into the spectrum. And the town of Niagara Falls is actually a pretty jumpin' place at night! So yeah. That was today.     Last song I listened to:   Master Of Puppets  by Metallica.    Last album I listened to:   S  M .    Last meal I ate:  Shrimp Tetrazini.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  They had a shop selling tiny model saxophones... Heheheh... I refrained from buying one, though.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.    Last person I talked to:  Absolutely no one.    Favorite song today:   Jump In The Fire  by Metallica.    Favorite food today:  My shrimp tetrazini. :)    Most interesting thing I did today:  Walked around and took a carriage ride :P.    Funniest thing that happened today:  A family seated behind us at the restaurant in which we ate dinner had apparently sold their boat today, so they were celebrating... And they were all drunk as skunks. It was more annoying than funny, but funny nonetheless.
