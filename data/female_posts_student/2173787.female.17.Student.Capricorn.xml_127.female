Friday night we went to services at 5:20 and then went to the Solkowitzs' for dinner and stayed until 11 ish.  Spent the rest of my time with my cousins playing pool, or with Erica and my cousins at Armadillo.  I realized that I may have found part of what I always felt was missing.  A truly relaxed day, with no appointments, no homework, no rushing (except to get to services at a reasonable tome).  To top it all off I awoke this morning to snow, which canceled work and class, so I get another day without deadlines.  Very nice indeed.
