It is kinda funny because it is like that for my whole family. All of a sudden we all yell, "SUN SHOWER!" We are true Floridians.  Yeah, so today was the first day of rookie camp. I had my screw ups of course.... but hopefully it will be better tomorrow and Saturday with the whole band. And that's about it there....  So, does everyone have little secrets? I just finished a book that was written by a British author and I loved it. I love the way they talk and use words like dappy and posh. It makes me smile. But I tried thinking of all my little secrets and quirks....  When I am alone in my car I turn up the music and sing really loudly  I do the same at home in my room : )  I can sit away in my room and read for ages  I get jealous quite easily  I loose my temper a lot  I will spend an entire day watching the "Anne" movies.... Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, and the third one.... oops, I can't think of the name.... Gilbert Blithe wins me over everytime!  I like lighting candles and playing with the wax  I will let my room get as messy as my mom allows me to  I love to laugh  I think about a lot before I fall asleep and the thoughts often comfort me and make me smile  I like to sit in the garge and watch the rain  I borrow my sister's clothes  I like to be happy  When I was little I used to run around the house tilting my head side to side with my pointer finger pointing up and each hand alternating with my head. It is hard to explain, but we have it on video when I am in my ballet recital costume.... it is really funny. And I still do the head bit.... and people always ask me "What the heck are you going," or they laugh at me!  I am quiet  And I know a lot of those aren't really secrets, but they are little tidbits of me.... I mean, what is the point of hiding who you are? Why be afraid? Don't know? Well, neither do I....
