The worst part is that it's been like this for like at least 3 days now, and death is upon me.  And worst of all, there's constant lightening/thunder, making stupid power outages that last less than a second.  Why can't it just rain already?  God damnit.  Well today, I didn't wake up till 4:30 p.m., w00t.  But that's probably because I didn't go to sleep at 5 a.m.  Heh heh.  I would have stayed up longer, but the sun was rising and the birds were starting to chirp.  I actually did wake up at 9:30, but I didn't think that 4 and a half hours of sleep were enough, so I went back to sleep.  I'm still feeling nauseous, bleh.  Tomorrow is Tim's bday party and I have yet to get him a present.  Halfsies anyone?  Now to quote Homer Simpson, "Marriage is like a coffin, and each kid is like another nail..."  ...la Gu
