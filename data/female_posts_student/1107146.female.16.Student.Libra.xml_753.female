If I had thought it would be a good thing, I would have said yes; but I figure if you're to the point where you can be gf/bf, this sort of mediation shouldn't be needed. And I know it sounds really parental and "Father knows best"ish, but I'm really of the opinion that no one can teach you things like this, and if they try to, you'll probably end up learning them wrong. I hope things work out OK in any case.  Some guy just came to the door, raising money for a wheelchair basketball team. I asked me how I was doing, I gave the standard, "Pretty good, you?" and then he paused, looked at me sort of ponderingishly, and said "Really good...actually." I thought that was a really cool answer, and I wondered what led to him being able to say that. I don't know why, I just thought I would share. We bought the book, by the way, and you should too. After all, my dad's disabled and  could  qualify to be on that team if he could shoot hoops and maneuver a wheelchair worth a damn. So buy it.  And Linds, keep on with your posts despite this, don't reply to that last part, pretend it's not there. I just had to put that down because it just happened and I wanted to record it.
