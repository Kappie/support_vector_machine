You can check it out in the web template section at  urlLink DHP1080.com . Feel free to comment and let me know what you think. Oh! And I made a  urlLink deviantART  account today and posted my new template design  urlLink here . Other than that, nothing really major happened today.     Last song I listened to:   Careless Whisper  by Ben Folds featuring Rufus Wainwright.   Last album I listened to:  Soundtrack from Cirque du Soleil's  La Nouba .   Last meal I ate:  Chicken, rice, vegetables.   Last movie I watched:   For Your Eyes Only .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Don't know.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Hmm... No chemistry moments today :(.   Last person I talked to:  Dan or Steph.   Favorite song today:   Rectifier  by RA.   Favorite food today:  S'mores.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Made my awesome new web design template.   Funniest thing that happened today:  We were making s'mores earlier, and I heated a skewer red hot and effortlessly poked a hole right through a napkin, a graham cracker, and then a chocolate bar wrapper :P. I guess you really had to be there.
