I visited my nephew and he is the most ADORABLE baby  ever .   He kicks so much now and he attempts to talk but all it sounds like is "agoo, abadagooo"..it's soooooo cute!  He's almost 6 months old now.     I've gone hiking now for once a week for 2 weeks now!!! Yay!! I plan on doing this every weekend.  I don't get hardly enough exercise in the week...the least I could do is go hiking once a week.  At least to get a some sort of a workout.
