Flowers from the beautiful garden withered Flame from the candle wick faded Air from the inflated balloon escaped Droplets from the puddle of water evaporated Breath from a living man taken away Yet the memories of hers remains...   Take care frenz... God bless everyone. n i noe tt He will help me look after her in heaven. ^_^ i m glad. really feel happy for her.
