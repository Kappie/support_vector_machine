I started a new job two weeks ago that does not give me the time that I used to have to surf the net and I am attempting to start my own business.  So my hands have been really full. I am still making attempts to get out of relationship that is doing nothing for me.  I don't even consider it a relationship anymore.  How did I get involved with the most ignorant man walking the face of the earth.  Well that is not the topic that I wanted to take about.  I am on to bigger and better things and I just need to find a way to knock him off the wagon. I can't believe how one idea could have developed into possibly an entire business.  I am now in the process of getting my business cards made and hopefully everything else will fall in line from there.   urlLink First Listen:  'Summertime'  I don't know if you all out there watched American Idol this past season or not but I Believe by Fantasia has become one of my theme songs.  Just click on the link above and select "I Believe".  Hope you enjoy it as much as I have. I been checking back with you all hopefully real soon.  Hopefully I have some more free time on my hands.  Maybe I will be able to cut out that sixth day of work.
