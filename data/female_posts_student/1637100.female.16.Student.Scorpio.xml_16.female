(this was around midnight) and all of a sudden this HUGE moth flew in through the open window.. and i freaked out.. it was HUGE anywaiz.. i was trying to whack it with a towel, and then i tried to get it with a tissue.. and then shan came in to help me.. finally we decided to trap it with a empty toilet paper roll and so i trapped it inside the roll and shan slid a book underneath it.. then we tried to thhrow the moth out the window.. i shook the toilet paper roll and then i looked inside to see if the moth was gone but it was right by my hand and it scared me so i screamed really loud and ran to my bedroom.. with shan close on my heels.. we were laughing so hard.. finally we decided to try again.. this time we filled the toilet paper roll half with tissue so it couldnt touch my hand coz i was scared of it.. and then we threw the whole roll out the window.. we were laughing sooooooooooo hard.. and my mom and dad both told us today that they got woken up by our loud laughter n screaming.. HAHA it was funny.. another funny experience was the other night.. me and shan and malc n zack were home alone and it was like 9:30.. we were sitting around the computer.. and it was really dark.. we were getting scared.. coz i saw this weird flash through the other window so i decided to go close all the blinds.. i got up and it was really scary so i told shan to come with me.. malc n zack followed.. i closed all the blinds.. and i had to close the window in the kitchen.. as i was closing it zacks hand brushed against my butt and it freaked the life out of me.. i SCREAMED so loud that they all started screaming and ran from the kitchen.. then we were sitting aroudn the computer and we all hear a thump.. then we saw another flash and then heard another thump.. by now our nerves were really on edge so on the next thump we all got up and ran into the next room which is my sis's bedroom and HID there.. realizing that there were no blankets or anything to hide under, me and shan ran out to the family room and in two seconds flat grabbed and carried 2 blankets and 5 pillows back to the room.. there we spent our next 30 minutes hearing thumps and being scared.. we had the fone and decided to fone to see when my parents would come home.. we were REALLY scared.. finally someone came home..(it was my dad n jo but we didnt know that).. then jo came to her room and opened the door really slowly which freaked shan out and she screamed and we all started screaming and hid under the blankets.. jo must've thought we were nutz.. later on we were still freaked out like freaked out to answer the fone and go in the garage.. and we were genuinely scared the whole time.. but it was funny.. definitely funny..!
