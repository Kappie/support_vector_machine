It's not bad but the roads are wet enough. I don't have to even look for I can hear when the cars pass by. I went to the gym today. I did 1.55 miles in 20 minutes on the treadmill! Yeah... I could do better I know. I'm in such a bad shape... I am short at 4'11" 115 lbs and with a poor lungs... *sighs* but I'm working on it! :) I may not get any taller but I think I can improve my endurance. Feeling slightly pressure I am. I have to find a job, soon! Before the school year even starts I have to find one. I HAVE to find one. My very survival depends on it. I have to buy my own stuff this year because money is really tight. So... tomorrow I'm planning on going on a job hunt. Well.. I think that's it for today entry.
