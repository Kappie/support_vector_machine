Right now, I'm sortta feeling tired, even though last night I slept 15 hours! That's because about 3 hours ago, I had stitches on my tounge. See, it's really a funny story; I was kickboxing with Craig. Now Craig is good. No, he's beyond good, he's great, increadiable, exellent. And I'm only so-so. Well, anyways, Craig and I are in the ring together, and I'm sort of holding my own when Craig lands a right hook to my head, and an uppercut to my jaw. This sends me flying backwards and I land on my tailbone, and my head slams into the floor. Being caught completely unprepared, I had my mouth open so my teeth smashed down on my tounge. I bit straight through, and the tip was only hanging on by some tissue in the corner. Instantly my mouth was filled with blood. I had gotten the wind knocked out of me, and I was gaging for air. Blood was sputtering out of my mouth, and I couldn't tell which way was up, I was so dissorientated. People rushed over to me, and helped me up. They got me to open my mouth, and looked at my tounge. I don't think that they could have seen much with all the blood and all, but I obiously needed stiches. I was rushed into someone's car with a couple towels under my chin, and we sped our way to St. E's emergency center...  Rest of my adventure tomarrow when I'm not so tired!  ~Ani
