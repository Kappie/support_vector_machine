I've been dreaming a bit lately, which is unusual fo me, so it's a sure sign that I have too much in my head; dreams are the brains way of shitting, getting rid of all the excess stuff that's hanging around. But I hate dreams. They're a fantasy, something that'll never happen, not real or certain. Just fluff. Bah...   I have no destination. I'm on a straight road, but I seem to be stuck; not moving in any direction. My life has no purpose. It feels like a filler; somewhere to be whilst waiting to move onto the next stage, and I'm stranded, in the same place, waiting for something, but I don't know what it is. I feel ignored, like 'they' forgot to give me something to look forward to, something to do while I'm here. I am. That's all. I don't do anything, I just be. I don't be anything in particular, just be.   I wish I could be somebody else, though,someone who wasn't ignored, someone who has a purpose. I just want to get out of this hole. I hate it, I hate this. I hate being nothing...  Someone said that I'm a rock; to my friends, to everyone. But who will be my rock? Who can I depend on. Who'll be there for  me ?  I want something, anything....but I have nothing.  I wish someone would help me pick myself up off the floor...
