I'm no snob but these people are from my "ghetto past"...yeah I used to live in the hood.  For example... the conversations moves to cinema and I say "Yeah Bowling For Columbine was probably the best film I've seen this year" ......all I get in return are blank expressions.....I try again "You know the Michael Moore documentary" and then they all look at me like I'm short then someone asks "What... they show documentaries at the cinema?"....I then decided to spend the entire evening starring into space whilst they continued their enlightening conversation about the best ways to spend money they didn't have.   Don't you just love the ghetto fabulous!!!!!
