It was my third time trying (Shh, don't tell anyone!),but I finally got it!  You know what they say, third time's the charm!  So, I've been driving around a few times on my own.  I love it too!  So, I've been planning my sweet sixteen b-day party!  I can't wait!  It's not going to be anything big, for certain reasons, and I can only invite about 8 to 10 people, but I invited my closest friends, so it's should be a lot of fun!  I just hope everything turns out okay!  Plus, my best friend in the whole wide world is coming up from Pawley's Island on Thursday for my b-day party!  I haven't seen her since Christmas and I really miss her!  She's the most fun person you could ever meet!  We met in second grade and it took us a while, but after about five months, we became unseperable!  She moved back to Pawley's Island after we finished third grade.  But, her grandparents live here in Easley, so I get to see her a lot. I really don't know what I'd do w/o her!  So, I think this week could possibly be one of my best for the summer!  I'll let you know if that ends up being true!  Well, I'm signing off!  Buh bye!
