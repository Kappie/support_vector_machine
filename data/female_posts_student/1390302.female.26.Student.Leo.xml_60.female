I suppose that it’s a relatively common thing to think of considering that nearly all of my friends have some trouble or other.  The question on my mind is how much is too much?  When does a loving request or a deep dark fantasy become depravity?  When does it cross the line, breaking the determined boundary?  I suppose that for these questions to be answered I would have to explain what is meant by “determined boundary.”  It is my belief that, in a relationship of any kind, the two parties set the boundaries of the relationship in the very beginning, either by conscious spoken agreements, or by actions.  The boundaries exist for the understanding and benefit of both parties; they are set to the liking of both parties and can be changed only by the express consent of both parties involved.  For example, if at the beginning of a relationship a couple expresses to one and other that they wish for the relationship to be an “open” relationship, they both agree, then go on this way for 2 years.  One day, one party wishes to change that to monogamy, it should be by the consent of both partners.  Another less exaggerated example would be if from the beginning of a relationship the couple never talks about past relationships, then it should change only by the consent of both partners.    Okay, now. When is it hypocrisy?   When does it become too much?  What is a fair thing to expect of your partner?    I have been thinking that it is mostly consistent of what the parties to the relationship are willing to put up with.  In a relationship, each partner brings something, or things, of value to the relationship –if they didn’t there wouldn’t be a relationship. If one party brings more than the other, that partner has a right to request equal trade.  Yet in the system of Objectivism, where two parties should be allotted equal trade for his or her value, value should be an “objective” term.  The said “value” SHOULD NOT be determined by the value that the parties place upon their commodity.  It is pretty much understood that people have trouble being objective about their own value, ego and pride play devils advocate when measuring ones own value.    So if this is true, and two parties cannot come to an agreement, what should be the remedy?  I personally believe that there can be none.  I think that either a partner is willing to see the objective value in his or her partner, or they are not.    It’s not for a person to waste their value, or witle it down to the “Expected” value of their partner.  So I sigh, because it’s a question which plagues me and one which I cannot solve.  I’ll keep you posted…  Kristyn
