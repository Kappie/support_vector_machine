Forever By John Stamos (Full House)  If every word I said could make you laugh I'd talk forever  (together my love)  I asked the sky  just what we had it showed forever  (together my love)  If the sun has it for you to fill your heart with joy I'd sing forever  (together my love)  Forever, forever  I felt so happy lovin you  With the love I have for you live in your heart and be forever  (together my love)  Forever, forever  I felt so happy lovin you  If every word I said could make you laugh I'd talk forever  Forever, forever  I'd be so happy lovin you
