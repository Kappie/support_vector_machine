I am just so happy to be back here and all. And yet I am kind of sad. I'm really sad that my freedom is kind of gone, but really my mom isn't too crazy about it.    Today was a lot of fun though. A LOT! Veronice, Ellen, Tim, Nelly, Michael, Nicole, Travis, Tracie, Rocky, and Aubrey came to celebrate with us. It was fun. We did a lot of talking and Travis and I played a lot of football, well technically catch. And we flagged down the ice cream man and had some ice cream! It was a good time. I really enjoy Veronica, she's so sweet. I adore her.    Well I know that I said that I was going to do a recap of the past three weeks with my dad, but i guess I kind of discovered that its really not necessary. But here are a few of the highlights:    Fourth of July: We lost The Chad. Damn it. Fire at Max's with Josh and Amanda. Mandy yelling ASS really loud when the firecrackers stopped. The guy who almost died when the box of fireworks blew up.    July 9 and 10: The 9th, going to see anchorman with Mandy and Chad. Chad's really funny stains on his pants. HAHA. The pizza getting dumped in Mandy's garbage, sorry! And Chad and Mandy over to watch 50 First Dates on the 10th. Good times!!    July 11 - 15: CAMPING!! Fun and not so fun. Extreme Volleyball, Taking Kevin's car, Sleeping with Max, Enjoying the time with the family and friends. I'll never forget how long those 5 days seemed to take!!    Tuesday Nights: Nip Tuck. Swooning around the TV with Mandy and Max. YES!!    July 22nd: CANOEING!!What a blast!! The scary bug and the cutie Chadd. Sinking our boat trying to learn how to splash. All those good times.    And WOW now its over. Time flies. And its really has been so much fun And I really have left so much out. And the month of June rocked too. I hope August is just as amazing!! It is my "summer of sin" so it better last into the school year.    Well I know I will be back with some more later but I must be going now. Oh but I've been to 15 states... in your face beotch!!! 15!! Illinois, Indianna, Nebraska, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Texas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. YES!! I rock!!!    bye    -gabby
