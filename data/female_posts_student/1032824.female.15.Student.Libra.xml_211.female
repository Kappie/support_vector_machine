Well, the holidays have been great so far. I love to go back to school because I get to spend time with my friends like Kalyn, Jeremy, Nana, Jiax, Fiona, Jason, Gabriel and Amelia. In addition, I managed to take some time off to unwind by indulging myself in.. shopping! And sleeping, day-dreaming, playing my guitar, chilling out and just doing all the kind of things which doesn't involve much thinking. Hee hee. :)   It rained this morning and we couldn't go for our morning jog. So Amelia called me and suggested going to town with Kalyn and Melissa. We lost Dear Kalyn - long long story! But I'm relieved that we found her. Haa haa. I bought a pair of flip flops for only $9 at these little tents beside Isetan and they're so adorable! They look pretty - got these neat tiny sea shells on them. I also got this RipCurl sling bag at a 20% discount. YUMMY! That's why I love the Singapore Sale. Ho ho! Kalyn was excited to meet up with Her Excellency but she couldn't make it. * Sniffle * Anyways, Thank you so much girls, I enjoyed myself so much today! :)  I just saw  Celebrity Boot Camp  and it rocked my socks! :) I love it. Hee hee. I was hoping Vitamin C would stay for a longer period though, I like her. Recruit Lamas is so good-looking! I don't think I would continue watching the show if there weren't any attractive guys in it. There are quite a few pretty girls, Recruit Bingham is from Bay Watch. And hmm.. Recruit Coolio is a Grammy Award Rapper. You guys should see it, especially those NPCC and NCC peeps, hee hee. It's on 10pm on every Saturday.   Good night sweethearts. Don't let the bedbugs bite. ;)
