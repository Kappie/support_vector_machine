My driving is a lot better than it was before.  I think once my Dad's contract expires he is going to review with me uphill and downhill parking, and probably some parallel parking too so then I can take my drivers test.  I feel a lot more confident now, and a lot more ready.  Once I review that stuff I should be good to go.  I also went to the zoo today.  There were so many people there.  I think half of Calgary was there actually.  It was really neat cause I saw the new white tiger they have, it was so beautiful.  And I saw cute little (actually big) sloth bears playing - how cute.  And I said the cute lil' adorable red panda.  There were other things I saw, but of course the tigers, sloth bears, and the red panda seems to stand out more in my mind.  Got school tomorrow.  I am excited of course but scared for Bio for some reason.  Silly me!  I am also kind of nervous because the model UN is going on during the weekend I am involved in it, so basically I am going to be very busy next weekend.  The closer it gets to it, the more nervous I get.  Though great people are also doing it with me, like Megan, Kenda, Elisa, and Maria to mention a few names.  I think I will be getting a ride with Elsie that day, but if not then probably Megz.  I think we will stick together cause we won't know a lot of people.  We had a sub for English on last day of classes before the holidays, but our English teacher was there and told us to read a story and that we were having a test when we get back on the story.  See the thing is - I don't remember the story that I read!  I mean I didn't understand it in the first place, but it was Wednesday that we read it.  What am I suppose to keep these things stored in my precious memory???  I don't think so!  So I am thinking that tonight I might read it again just in case.  I also can't wait for Active Living and Drama tomorrow.  Hopefully we get to play Kinball again in Active Living cause that was like so incredibly fun!  And well in Drama we are putting the final touches on our February 18th performances for the Open House at the school.
