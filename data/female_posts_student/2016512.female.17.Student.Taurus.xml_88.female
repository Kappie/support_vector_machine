A single streak of clouds came across the moon. The affect might have also been helped by the fact that I was listening to a song that reminded me of all my friends. It was kind of like that australian guys "sunscreen," but this was a girl talking about the shit in her life and the good things that come out of it. it rocked, but sadly i don't know the name. yay for the song currently known as "Untitled."  K-E-Y...Y because we hate you! *cheesy grin* -Betso
