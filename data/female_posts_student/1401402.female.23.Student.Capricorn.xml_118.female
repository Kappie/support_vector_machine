At home, you drink for half the cost and you don't have to tip the guy who gets the beer out of the fridge."  Yeah, it costs half or less, the beer is as good or better, and you don't have to wait for your next one. Plus, the music is fantastic. So, why go out drinking? I suppose, if you're feeling flush and social.  Dude com’on now, I’m not a bar kinda gal. Its boring….. Don’t ask me to go to a freaken bar. Never ask Sakdary to a freaken bar. Don’t pursuant Sakdary to go to a bar. Cuzz the answer would be NOOOOOOO….
