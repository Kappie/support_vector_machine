But it needs to get done because I told this professor that I would do it over the summer.  I had planned to have it all complete by the end of June.  But friends coming back into my hometown and planned roadtrips kept me busy until the middle to end of July.  Procrastination is a bitch.   On a different note, I'm loving the weather here.  Its almost as if the dog days of summer have been skipped.  As fall is my favorite season, I can't really complain about anything.  (Although today its raining, but hey its not humid or the "Don't touch me" weather.)  I'm hoping that we have an indian summer until mid-October.  That would be awesome.  Especially on the football weekends.  Ok....back to effectively working boredom......
