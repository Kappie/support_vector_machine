Another tiring day, stuck up printing songs, left alone at home..one thing uplifted my spirit though, i watched Boys and Girls and Freddie Prinze was just awesome and yummy...(as usual)But then Claire got him..argh! Bummer! Hmm...i miss my bestfriend who's in LB right now, (Brum, i know you'll be reading this later on), i really miss our escapades in college. How comforting it would be just to spend it watching latest great movies abd then hang out at the Park...(lam mo na yun..) Mom arrived late...from Church, a little bit disappointed since i ordered some food...not even pizza..argh! Spent the rest of the evening finishing up all the printing jobs left for me. And listen to songs from the James Taylor, Bread, Michael Johnson to Linkin Park, Smashing Pumpkins, Blink and Goo Goo Dolls then to Parokya ni Edgar, Side A, Freestyle then Rivermaya.  Then, logged on at around way past midnight and got to chat with the person who showed me the way back to BLOG... I wonder...how much Blogger is paying JCR for this...hehehehehe Just a thought!
