Now I can't remember what I wanted to write. Everyone is expecting too much from me right now.  They don't understand that I can't deal with everything, I can't deal with all of their problems.  I need my space.  I don't have the mental capacity to handle everything.  I hear from (name deleted) that (name deleted) is upset with me because I broke off our plans.  What bothers me, is that I told him from the very beginning that I didn't know if the plans would work out in the first place.  What the hell am I supposed to do about it?  Too many appointments, too many thoughts twisting through my head, too little concentration, too many people, too little time.    They don't understand.  Tyrells says he's been where I am before, obviously not, because he's still telling me that I shouldn't ditch my friends.  I tell them that I just need some time to be a lone, yet they still have these high expectations.  Well, too fucking bad.  I need to think of myself for once, and I'm not going to let them take control of my life and tell me what I'm doing is wrong.  You are not me, you do not see things the same way I do.  So fuck off. I need a new pen.  This one is annoying.  God damnit.  I can't even think of what to write.  It's challenging to keep my mind focused on one thing.  Everything is spinning around in my head.  Cyclones... blenders.... chopping up my thoughts, hopes, and dreams.  This was a good morning.  Four people said hello to me in the hall.  It made me want to skip.  So I did.
