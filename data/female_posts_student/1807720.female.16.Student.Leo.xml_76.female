I tried and tried to understand my math but I just don't "get it."  I really wanted to finish at least one math assignment too but I couldn't finish it.  I feel so bad, like I am giving up but that is certainly not the case.  I don't think I am doing too well in chem either.  I don't know what to do.  I know lots of people have difficulties learning in life and stuff but things should not be really diffucult for me like this all my life.  Literally all my life things have been difficult and it makes sense that maybe I do have some sort of learning problem.  People don't seem to think so though, they think there is nothing wrong with me but man if they knew how many times I cry and get frustrated with things and how difficult everything is.  I put so much effort in and get hardly anything out and it is soooo annoying and not fair.  How come I can't get good marks if I put so much effort into trying and trying to understand and doing my homework.  I don't know what is wrong with me but something is...I know it.  I know that things in life should not be this hard or frustrating and they should not have to go through all I have been through.
