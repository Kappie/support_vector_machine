In my head i think he has changed or that he will have the will to change for me, but i'm starting to think that i'm part of his game. i feel at times that i'm just another player in his game and when he is done he'll just throw me in the closet and forget about me forever. i hope that is never the case, because he really did steal my heart from the start, i just hope he saves it all before its too late. i guess i'll just have to wait and see!
