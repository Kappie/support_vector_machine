No paper tomorrow, but I've got Chinese O Levels Oral. Owell.  I found this blog. Nothing really escapes my eyes afterall. Hahaha! Okay, that sounded so haughty.  Anyway, I was contemplating whether to lock my blog or not, I went to try google.com and yahoo.com today. Typed "Winnie Leong" and my blog came out to be the first on the list. Woah.  I feel so voyeuristic.. not knowing who reads more blog. Owell, I've got nothing to hide anyway. This is getting boring.  -edited post/ truncated-
