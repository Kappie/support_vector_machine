I have plenty of Homework and plenty of work related work… in fact I really haven’t had much time to think for myself. Saturday is my first meeting with the wonderful group of the 319th Sig Bn Family support group. They scheduled a meet and greet/ potluck with a computer class to help all of those who need it (to get through the Yahoo Group that was set up by the Lt. Col.’s Wife. So far there has been a great outcome of support among the email group but I am not too sure that too many people are even going to show up on Saturday. Danielle Barber and I are going to car pool together, and I am hoping that I will get a chance to meet some of the people I have been chatting with in the email group.   I got to talk to Jesse last night but I wish I could say our conversation went undisrupted, but it didn’t. His phone kept on cutting in and out on us and eventually we gave up. I did, however get to talk to him for a good and fair amount of time. He told me that they were scheduled to leave the states on March 15th, but we still don’t know where he is going. I am sure by now he knows but as a security precaution he cannot tell me. I already know that once he gets over there they will assign him an APO address and that is all the information I need to know. Jesse told me that he would send me pictures of the sites from where ever he is at, that will be really neat to see.   Part of me is glad that the wait is finally over, I mean soon he will be over there and I can start counting the days, weeks and months that really count, but part of me is scared that he is going, and part of me doesn’t want to let him go. I know he will be ok, I mean I have been told that the group they are replacing didn’t have any casualties, and I am fairly confident that he knows how to handle himself in any given situation. I understand that he has to go because hundreds of thousand of soldiers are counting on them and need their services. Communications is important. But part of me can’t help but be selfish about the whole thing.  Yesterday Jesse told me that he  was going to send me a picture of Him and Carrie. I asked him who Carrie was and he told me it was his gun. He told me it is a tradition in the armed forces to name your firearm, and the first thing that came to his mind was Carrie. I asked him where he got that from and he said from Stephen King’s “Carrie”. That made me laugh. Any way I have taken up enough of your time with my babblings… ttyl!
