People forget to make the most of what we have. Ahh... hey people, if you wanna listen to some thing listen to Goo Goo Dolls they're good and relaxing. Everything I listen to has to be relaxing! Hehe... especially Manu Chao! No one knows them in my class! And they're the biggest European band! Yeaay for Manu Chao! Boo to English 'pop music' *shiver*. Does any one actually like that crap any more...? I better go guys, actually blog when I have some thing to blog about!
