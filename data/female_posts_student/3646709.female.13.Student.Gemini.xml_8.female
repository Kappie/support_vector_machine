I haven't done a post in like FOREVER!! well umm.. lemme think when the last time was... probably like the day after fourth of july. anyway, i got back from austin yesterday! it was fun fun fun! the first day we went to my mom's office, then went shopping, then went to barton springs, this really cold spring/pool, then we went to the oasis for dinner. I had yummy enchiladas. then on thursday we went to schlitterbahn. THEN on friday we rented a boat on lake travis for like 4 hours. I knee boarded and swam a little bit! it was soo much fun! but.. i got sunburned which really sucks. then on saturday we just sat @ the hotel and then left around 9:45. when we got home i went to leigha's and we went slip-and-slidding @ jeannie's, then i ate then went to amanda's to spend the night. then today i stayed @ amanda's then ate w/ her and now she's over here! YAY! well.. i don't know what else to say. i just pretty much told you what i did for a week. latas.
