But, I have not found any TVB video rental shops around Bukit Batok or Bukit Gombak area yet. Does anyone know? Please tell me by leaving the address at "Comments". Thanks.   Based on the trailer found in  urlLink TVBI COMPANY LIMITED , it should be an exciting and interesting series. And best of all, Flora is starring in it.   Hehehehe...
