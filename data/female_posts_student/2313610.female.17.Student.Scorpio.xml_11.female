By some absolute miracle I found the translated lyrics of Rise. I love it so much, because, like all the songs in Ghost in the shell, it's so powerful. I'm going to post the translation, because I doubt cyrcillic is of any use to you all.  I'm a soldier, and that means I'm both defendant and judge I am standing on the two ends of fire Bending over the steep turns, overtaking death and life I'm running to fight the shadow of the lies  No matter how much threads deceit weaves The truth will show the face of light  *Save your tears for the day when our pain is far behind on your feet come with me we are soldiers stand or die  Save your fears take your place save them for the judgement day fast and free follow me time to make the sacrifice we rise or fall  I'm a soldier, born to stand in this waking hell I am witnessing more than I can compute  pray myself we don't forget lies, betrayed and the oppressed please give me the strength to be the truth  people facing the fire together if we don't, we'll lose all we have found  *repeat  Chase the dream to the edge of the abyss This is the only way to save the world  Don't you cry, Hide your tears Because there'll be a new day Your fire Will be heating Thousands of hearts Now, rise up Hide your pain and fear far off  The one who is right will win Remember, everything is in your hands  *repeat
