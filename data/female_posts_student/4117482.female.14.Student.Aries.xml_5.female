Last night , while I was awake (i think i'm an insomniac), I sat at the end of my mum's bed and just thought. Are we forever haunted to live the same days over and over again? Are we in somewhat of a black hole? Althought I hate the phrase "life is short", last night I believed it. It's hard to do something exciting everyday, but I want to. Maybe this is just me looking into stuff, or I shouldn't have probably listened to "sunscreen" by Baz Lurhman, earlier on in the week. Either way, I scared myself. For a few minutes I was so tempted to just leave my house, and take a train to Oban. To see Chris! At the time I felt I couldn't bare to spend 2 more minutes of routine. Ever think about those days that you can barely remember, the ones where there's nothing worth sharing? We have so many of them. So, i've decided...today after work, I'm going to do something spontanius and every day, from now on. This is a small step, but at least it's in the right direction!      There is one thing on my mind. The other night practically everyone in my house was drunk and/or high. So my mum said it was oay to have friends round for a while at midnight, so they just popped in. One of these people, was Paul. My current boyfriend.  During the night I was sitting on his knee, and my mum came in. She didn't seem bothered. Later on my brother (overprotective bastard) came in and ased everyone's age. Paul is 16, two years older than me. Later on my mum and brother pulled me out into the hall and said something along the lines of "Euan thinks your showing interest in the older boy", it was pretty harsh on Paul...and he heard it. I was really upset once they'd all left. :( My friend Roslyn was staying over so we done girly stuff (that neither of us are accustmed too) like nail painting! We chatted,ate chocolate,drank tea,watched 'Almost Famous'  and stayed up till 6am! Right now I'm at work, it's been somewhat of a skive, haven't had to do anything really. Had a subway sandwich for lunch , t'was awesome! I shall post later on or tomorrow. Peace and Empathy Love and Huggles, Rhona xxx
