I can't believe I'm updating this again...it's the second day in a row!! of course, it is new....and I don't have to worry about anyone reading it....'spretty cool.  I can't wait for school to start, thank goodness for wednesday. Maybe I'm weird....I just want to be able to have some social contact (although, this is Recluse Lydia I'm talking about...) and stop hanging around being bored all day every day. Plus I'll get to drive, woohoo.  Speaking of driving, I should get my license tomorrow. I mean, I AM going to get my license tomorrow. I guess I should look over my rule-booky-thingy but I'm really not too nervous, I know the test and I know I'm a good driver, and I don't have to drive the manual for the test. So even though I haven't driven for a week or so, I still think I'll pass. I'd better pass, because I refuse to take the MTD and have to walk all the way to that bus stop, it's insane. sigh.  I hope my mum gets my clothing allowance taken care of tomorrow so I can get some jeans...I don't really have a pair I'm willing to wear to school. and I did my job, I figured it all out and typed it up and printed it and submitted it for her approval...so technically she should really take care of it. I wouldn't mind having some of the rest of thatstuff before school starts, either.  I wonder if she's just gonna let me use my credit card for my allowance this time. Even though it's not a cash card, but she keeps saying she trusts me, so...it's cool though, I feel so powerful with that thing. I think maybe I need to ask her to make "emergency" more specific, lol...  once again, I have no idea how this post ended up so long. wow.
