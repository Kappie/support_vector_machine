AND I STILL CANNOT GET THERE!I swear to the Goddess I am really getting fucking pissed at this stupid fucking machine. If there was not so much money and so much of my life invested in the fucking thing, it would have gone right out the goddamn window by now. I mean, you would think if the search engine could find it, that I could get there, right? WRONG! Apparently not. Stupid fucking electronic piece of shit. One of my friends hates computers, will not touch one whatsoever, and she seems perfectly happy. If i wasn't so dependent on the damn thing, i would just say fuck it. but I can't do that. Besides, I would hate to have to handwrite all of my ranting and raving. That would suck.      Trying to locate a new host for my website, but there are certain things that I need to have , like the ability to put midis on my site, and a lot of the free sites don't offer that like my current one does. I just hate the fucking fact that it cuts off half of my page, and that makes it difficult to design a proper page. Plus I have a lot of pages, so a new host would have to allow for that as well. Oh well, the search continues...
