I unbuckled and opened the door and I heard air coming out of my tires, but I wasn't sure what the hell it was at the time....I SCREAMED "JONATHAN" and I looked up and james had made it down the hill and was coming up to me....jonathan was pulling up in his truck and he got out and just came up and hugged me....I screamed "SHIT, DAD'S GONNA KILL ME" and he was just like oh my gah, im glad you're ok...him and james watched it happen from james' driveway....I've never been so scared in my entire life.  I was sooooo glad they were there....After the police came and percision towed it off,  Jonathan took me home b/c mom and dad had left russ t's to come see about me so they went back and I went home.....I got a shower and he sat with me and I feel asleep on the couch....he took me to get something to eat later and then he left at sometime and went to charles'....I went out with chelsea and lacretia friday night till 12 and it was fun, but seeing "him" made my life harder......anway, saturday i didn't do anything.......today I didn't do anything either.....jonathan came over at like 7 something after work and ate homemade pizza with us...then at like 9 something me and him went to ruby tuesday's to look at some rims of jay's cousins...they are bad ass, and they'd look killer, but one of them is warped really bad so i doubt daddy will buy them for me...anyway, im about to head to bed....night night guys
