Nothing else really happened today...It was extremely boring. I did get mad at Bill a couple of times but for stupid reasons. Hey, he bought me jolly ranchers and a snapple so it was all good from then on:-P..Just kidding.   Anyhow...I REALLY want to find another skin for this..AHH. I can't find a good one. I want one that's kind of happier than this one. I'm sick of being sad all the fucking time. William and I are actually gradually getting better, which relieves a lot of stress that I've been having for the past bunch of months. Shit is going okay for once. I'm hoping that it gets even better. Although I hate when things are REALLY good, because then when shit gets bad again it's so much worse. Damn..sometimes I feel like I am walking on a road that has the same fucking scenery over and over and over and I only see something new once in an extremely great while.   Tomorrow is my last real day of school, and it doesnt really seem like it at all. In Global Studies we're still learning new shit that is on the final. I'm really really scared about Finals and Regents next week. I think that I'm going to fail all of them. I dont want to be in 9th grade again, that would suck. I am actually started to grow concerned about school. For a while I didnt give a fuck, but I do now. I think that I'd be passing everything if I wasnt so disorganized and didnt stay home from school all the fine. I dont even fucking have to be organized, I just need to stop being a lazy ass and get the hell up for school. *sigh*..I'm dissapointing myself.   I think I'm going to look for a skin YET again. I think I'm actually going to start writing every day..I miss it. I'm sorry Bloggie..I've been too good for you lately. :( I love you:-D hehe..You're the best! (okay..I know Im pathetic..but shhh)
