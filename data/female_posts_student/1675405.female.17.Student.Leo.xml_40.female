Kenny asked me to prom, and I so happy that I literally smiled for the rest of the day, up until dinner at least. Indeed, I felt a little insecure about the fact that a guy was asking me, especially after my lovely rendezvous with Wade at homecoming. So, although it may not have been the most appropriate thing to do at the time, I asked him flat out if he was asking me just so he would have a way to get there. He said no- actually, he said something along the lines of prom not being that important, but he'd have a blast going with me. That's flattering.  And as if things couldn't get any better for me, he wanted to take me to Bilo with him to pick out flowers and a card for his mother. He knew I was going on break so he waited for a good 15-20 minutes in the lobby for me. Plus, guys who treat their mother great respect women...always nice.I feel important, I feel special, and God-- I haven't felt like this... ever.
