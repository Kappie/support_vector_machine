The Corvair spacecraft has apparently been taken over- 'conquered' if you will- by a master race of giant space ants. It's difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive Earthman or merely enslave them. One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords. I'd like to remind them as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves."  -- Kent Brockman,  The Simpsons        For those of you that don't know, I worship The Simpsons.  urlLink Homer  mainly, but also the writing :P One of the funniest shows of all time.  But back to the  urlLink giant ant invasion ; it's nice to know my new city (as of March 2005) is so stable :P
