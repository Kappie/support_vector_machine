Wasted journey's  , time spent better   knowing nothing   and looks, they don't help.Prying eyes wander west to where   oceans   meet    gold   , and you wonder   why my heart, it breaks in two .  Hours   pass   into   minutes  ,    kissing the seconds away   , and days seem to   melt   just like your classic   summers  . It's come to the point where,    everything looses perspective   ... and i'm the one, and   i'm the one  who ... Prying   eyes wander west   to where   oceans   meet    gold   , and you wonder   why my heart, it breaks for you  .   Stupid things are said  , stupid things are done and when the   time comes   i'll shout from    high mountain tops    ..
