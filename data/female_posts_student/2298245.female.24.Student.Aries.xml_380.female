I was kind of upset because I really didn't want to go.  My sister had asked me if I wanted to, and I told her not to buy me a ticket because I wasn't sure, but she went ahead and did it anyway, so I felt kind of obligated.  But once we started out there on the 7 train, my mood started to lighten a bit.  We got there very quickly, and it was fun getting to ride above ground and see the stadium coming up on our left.    Once we got there, things got even better.  We found out that Tom Glavine was going to be pitching, which was good news for those of us who are/were fans of his former team, the Atlanta Braves.  I am a fan not so much because he used to play for the Braves, but because he is hot.  We were right next to the bullpen, so we got to see him warming up before the game (but not before a slight bit of rain threatened our good time) and he even threw the ball that he'd been using to warm up with up to us.  It is now in my possession.  It would only be better if they'd stuck around to have him sign it, but hey, having an official Major League baseball that had been used by Glavine is cool enough.   It was Mike Piazza night, and since he'd just made the recordbooks for the most home runs by a catcher, and there were all these really great catchers who are also on the list there to help commemorate the moment - Carlton Fisk, Johnny Bench, Yogi Berra, and Gary Carter.  Tommy Lasorda was also on hand.  He got a new truck, and loads of other prizes, and it was pretty cool to be there for it.  We also got to sit next to this guy who was pretty cool - he goes to a lot of games, and makes lots of signs to hold up during the game when good Met things happen.  He also had a lot of cool buttons on his hat.  Overall it was a very cool experience, and it made me glad I had not forsaken the trip to accompany my grandmother to the theater.   The game itself was pretty exciting as well.  Glavine was less than stellar in his pitching, and the Tigers took a 2-0 lead fairly early.  But then Glavine drove in two runs to tie the game.  The one bummer was that since one in our group had to leave early - and he was too young to go it on his own - I was the lucky one who got to leave early with him.  He probably would have been fine on his own, but I had volunteered, and I knew that it would be my fault if something happened to him, so up we got at around 9:20 or so.  Anyway, we missed the best part of the game, when in the bottom of the 9th, with two outs, game still tied, Mike Cameron hit a home run to win the game for the Mets.  But it just so happened I was on the phone with my Dad (who was still at the game) at the exact second it happened, so it sort of felt like I was there.  I am very sorry I missed it, especially given the reason I had to come back into the city early - but that is a subject for another day.  Next time...I take some of the family to see  Assassins , and it doesn't turn out as badly as I'd imagined it would.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  Until then...
