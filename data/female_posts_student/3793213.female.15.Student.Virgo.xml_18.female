He goes with what may, he does not drive me places on time and is always late picking me up, unless I am with a boy. Then he is ten minutes early. I know this is out of love, but still, it angers me. Today I got ready to go to my dermatology appointment so my perscription could be tweaked or fixed or whatever but no. We were going to be late so I rescheduled. I hate late. I hate rescheduling. I hate it. I have homework I should be doing but I can't for the life of me concentrate on it. Oh And my sarcastic parents decided to make hot dogs and hamburgers to spite me and my decsion of veganism. When I came upstairs I had a banana and luke warm water for dinner. I'm literally starving because no one will bring me to shop for some vegan food I can eat. I've had a few potatoe chips today and thats it. It's one o'clock and I've eaten potatoe chips. And water. I have two apples to last me the week. It will be interesting for sure. I am going to stick with this too. I don't doubt it. But I'll probably die because my parents wont buy me a head of lettuce.  Kayle.  Goodbye.
