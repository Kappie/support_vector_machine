It was good at the time.  Then like two hours later my stomach really hurt.  Then this morning it was sooooo difficult to concentrate in Summer School and I can't miss classes cause then you get kicked out.  I even had to throw up in the middle of class.  I could feel the acid coming up and I know it wasn't going to stay don't so I quickly asked to go the the washroom and pucked up green and yellow stuff.  I am thinking my salad from yesterday.  All I ate this morning was two bites from my cereal and when I felt a little bit better (not 100% better) I wanted some fast food.  I have lost a a lot of weight too going to the washroom and throwing up, so I really didn't care if I had a happy meal from McDonalds.  That was so good!!  I haven't had one of those for years cause I usually don't eat anything from Mcdonalds.  The burger was small and so was the drink - a nice portion size for someone who is sick.  My mom had to finish my fries cause I was full and I was proud that I actually finished my small burger cause that was hard to get down.  That is the only real meal I had all day.  Usually I don't drink pop either, but something in it makes me feel better.  Luckily I felt ok when I wrote my quiz today and well my unit test is Thursday so I still have tomorrow to study.  I just really want to feel better tomorrow.  I don't want to be sick now.  I CAN'T miss Summer School.  I just want to get Social over with.  I do like Summer School though.  This is the first time I have actually ever found Social interesting.  Anyways I am going to watch TV cause I have been doing all the readings and assignments for the course earlier.  There is A LOT and it takes a while!  Anyways, hope I feel better tomorrow.
