Not that much though, just enough to get all dizzy and happy. :) Me and two friends of mine went to a couple of bars (even though I'm only 17 and in Finland you have to be at least 18 before you can get into any bars) and we had a good time.   Tomorrow I'm leaving for another city to visit my relatives and it's going to be pretty boring. I don't have any friends there and I won't be able to use the Internet so often. There are no good programs on TV at summer and the weather is not so good so I can't even go to a beach. Meh.  But two weeks... and then: Ilosaarirock festival! Another great reason to get drunk. :P
