We talked for a while and then we went to the movies at about 2:30. We saw New York Minute. It was awsome. When we got back we played a game called Tommy. We have a plate of lollies and one person goes out of the room. The other people have to pick a lolly then call the person back into the room. That person starts picking lollies and when they pick the lolly everyone has chosen everyone yells out 'TOMMY' and that person doesn't get anymore lollies.     It was fun. After that we played a balloon game in the lounge room. We had balloons that we had to keep off the ground. The last one to catch their balloon when the music was off is out. It was lots of fun. Then we played truth or dare. It was cool. I had to kiss my friend's little brother!! Then we went to La Porcheta for dinner. Three of us had spaghetti bolanaise and the birthday girl had pizza. We kept putting coke and rasberry soft drink in each others' spaghetti bolanaise. It was funny. Then when we got home we got in to our sleeping bags and watched SpyKids 3D and then my friends brothers went to bed. Then we watched Freaky Friday and then the Haunted Mansion. It was scary. Then we played for a while. We talked and played sleeping bag tumbles. We rolled across the matrasses in our sleeping bags. It was fun. Then we drew on each others' backs with our fingers. Then we watched Cheaper By The Dosen and then we got to sleep at about 4 in the morning. Then on Sunday morning my mum picked me up at about 10:00. My lolly  basket  smarties, molteasers, snakes, timeouts and fads (lolly ones). It was a great party.          That sunday (after the party) my mum took me shopping. I got some stickers and a new handbag it's really cool. It's brown with a small blue heart in the corner and has two pockets on the front. It was lots of fun shopping with mum. For lunch we went to Knox Ozone to Sakura. We had a lunchbox each and a melon drink. The lunchbox has fried rice, sushi (with caviar), chicken and a salad. It was deeeeelicious. I had lots of fun this weekend.
