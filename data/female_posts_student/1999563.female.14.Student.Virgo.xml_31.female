Fruits with pits: Do not bite into. Break or cut to remove pit, cut into bite size peices. Corn-on-the-cob: Do not bite into. Cut corn off the cob. Crust: Do not bite into. Break or cut into bite size peices. Chips and tacos: Do not bite into. Subsitiute patato chips or flour tortillas Meat with bones: Do not bite off the bone. Cut meat from the bone Sticky candy: Do not chew. Soda: Rinse with water after drinking. Ice: Do not chew. Popcorn: Do not eat. Gum: Do not chew.   Wow. If I cut everything into bite size peices its gonna take SO long to eat!
