The phone rings.  "Hello?" "Hi! It's Nazrene." "Oh hi," says Jane sleepily. "You know, I had the most.." "..wonderful dream last night. I know I know." "WILL YOU STOP WITH THE PSYCHICNESS??" "Sorry." "Anyway, I was going on this date with.." "Janey, that wasn't a dream, that HAPPENED." Pause. "Seriously?" wonders Janey, intrigued. "Yuh! There was a dodgy waiter and at the end when you were about to leave you sprang out and kissed him." "Naz, the psy.." "Sorry." "Anyway." Long pause. "Anyway what?" "I dunno. Why did you phone me again?" "Oh yeh. Are you gonna come to Mike's partay or what?" "Oh that. I dunno." "You can come with Adam." "I guess." Pause. "I'd have to ask him first though." "Yeh." "But I don't have his number. He rang me." "Oh you silly moo." "Damn." "Well ring me when you find out, OK? I'm only supposed to invite like one friend and I don't wanna waste that invite." "You invited Phil, Shivani and everyone else as well didn't y.." "Yup." Jane laughs. "All right, I'll call you soon."   This should be easy,  she thinks to herself.  I'll just wait for him to call me. Or bump into him on the road or something.
