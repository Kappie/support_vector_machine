This few weeks were terribly emotionally draining. Not because of what happened in REAL life but more to what is my stupid and spastic biological system and hormones are wreaking within. I'm feeling so much more helpless..so much more out of place. I'm begining to feel a couple of times when I'm totally not MYSELF at all. Times at "rest" were not spent recuperating from the previous activity but more often than not, I'm indulging inconspicuously, the world of depression and make-believe. I'm getting so weak spiritually that I dun even dare to face God. I can't even bring myself sometimes to utter a prayer for my faith's sake. I'm so weak inside. Horrendous thoughts race franitically in my mind and make me do things that my physical flesh have no power of control over. I hate this. I really do. I'm not a very expressive person I do admit but the terrible minus point lies in that this pent up negativity drills a holes within me that only till now that I realized that it's doing a hell lot of damage to my emotinal, piritual, and physical well being. I hate lif ein general now.
