First off, Lucas made my week yesterday by coming down out of the blue just to see me! he evn had plans with friends back home that evening... I mean he left his work in the middle of the day to drive about an hour or so to come see me. Wow! Dont think anyone has done that before. Plus he is coming down to spend the day with me and my kids today. He really can amaze me. Ok so lets get this dark note out of my day. I dont what the deal is but I was asleep last night and missed a call from Lizzie. She was crying and very upset and I dont need two  guesses to know why! Kevyn. He can be soo fun and sweet and then such a little ass at the same time. He really enjoys being mean to her and they are the best of friends. She takes him dinner at work everyday, buys him stuff, makes her plans aroound him, goes to the gay bar because thats the only place he is comfy, etc, etc, basically kisses his ass! Sometimes I wonder if he is using her as a psych experiment? So more drama... yippie! I had strange dream last night that I will go into later, but for now... I am thinkin about a nap! Later
