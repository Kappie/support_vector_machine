There was a man, woman, and three kids standing outside with blankets wrapped around them. They were pulled over because of a flat tire. The family was on their way to Disney World in Florida in their van. The man couldn't even change the tire, he didn't know what the tool to change it was called, and besides that the cable to hold the spare tire on under the van was rusted on and unable to get off. Even if a person could get the spare off it would have done no good beings it was flat.  I do not understand why you would drive your family a thousand miles or so and not have proper equipment or the means to fix something if you needed too. Especially a flat tire.  My husband is a nice guy so he took the tire off for them and drove back to his shop and in the dark tracked down another tire and then converted it to the rim and so on.  The family was really nice and appreciated it very much. He didn't charge them anything but they gave him money anyways. Triple A would have been there in two hours they said.  On the way back with those peoples tire we discovered 2 more vehicles pulled over 2 miles before the van. After my husband helped them we went back to help the other because we don't feel that it would have been right to help one person and not another.  The one car had a flat but since it was an old car they had the proper spare and tools in the truck to fix it. The other vehicle was a 2004 Ford SUV the guy had the spare off but the rims that he had on there were so fancy that the 4 way wouldn't fit to take the tire that was messed up off. My husband then again drove back to the shop and grabbed a special tool and the big jack since this guy was pulled off on to the grass and his vehicle wouldn't have been able to be jacked up right from a little tire jack. This man was really nice, he had two and a half more hours to travel, he said that he also had two daughters about the same age as mine. The guy informed us that there was a piece of metal on the road that he walked back and threw in the grass. That's why there were so many flats in a short distance. The guys tire was sliced in half, almost in two pieces! The guy asked if Robert would take any money and my husband said no that's alright and the guy insisted that he would at least take a few dollars. When we got back into the car thinking that the guy had gave him 3 dollars we found that he had handed him three twenty dollar bills!   I guess it goes to show that there are still good people out there in the world that could use your help. I still figure people should go by their best judgment when stopping on the dark interstate in the middle of the night to help others.  I guess I hope that this makes others check to make sure that when traveling that they have all the necessary equipment to keep their journey on the right track. Well at least have air in your spare tire!
