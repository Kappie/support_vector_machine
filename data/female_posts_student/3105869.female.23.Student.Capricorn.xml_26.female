There's a part of you that is wondering what would happen if you just let it all fall apart. But this won't happen, for your common sense grabs you from behind and shakes you, reminding you that you are responsible and that there are things you must do. So you buckle in and do what's expected of you. It's your nature. And then you can go to bed respecting yourself. Thank You rick levine from AOL
