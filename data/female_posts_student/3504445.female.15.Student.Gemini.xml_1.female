LOVE ME NO MORE (by Bardot) i toss and turn in bed can't get you out of my head even though you're so far away i need you here with me oh boy, why can't you see that i can't live without your love when i close my eyes i think of you well i wish i had you here with me but there's nothing i can do, oh oh  chorus counting every day that goes by and the tears that i cry (tears that i cry) you don't wanna love me no more wish that you could hold me tonight i'm hurting inside cause you don't wanna love me cause you don't wanna love me love me no more  i tried to call your phone but you ain't been at home i need to find out where you are so i can make you see that you belong with me for me there is no other love when i close my eyes i think of you i wish i had you here with me but there's nothing i can do, oh oh  repeat chorus  all i know is that i can't live without you ooh, but i wanna know what made you feel this way i'll be right here for you (right here for you) and everything that you do (thing that you do) but how can i get close to you when you don't feel the way i do, ah hah  repeat chorus to fade
