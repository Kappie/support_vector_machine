I still am a little confused about math but that can be dealt with tommorow and well I think the Chemisty test went pretty good.  My throat is kind of sore right now but I'm sure that is not too big of a worry and well I felt kind of good today.  You know just one of those little simple nice things that happen in a second they make me feel so special.  Cause well I was walking down the hallway and Mrs. J was there was talking to some other teachers and well she just kind of smiled at me with a kind look.  Man did that even make me feel good, and it is those things that happen in like a second that mean so much.  Tommorow is the CALM carocell and well Matt's party is also tommorow and I can't wait to have some pizza.
