Every year around this time my mom gets the idea that what she really needs is a portrait of "her two beautiful daughters".  The entire thing is a load of shit, especially since she doesn't want her daughters looking their normal beautiful, instead she wants us primped and curled and dressed up.  This year she was going to let us go casual, so I had on this brand new sweater that she convinced me to buy last week.  I come downstairs and she's like, you can't wear that you look so pretty in the Burgundy (never mind that Kayla is wearing pastel pink and we would look awful standing together).  So I change into another sweater that I like, but my dad determined that to be too casual and demanded we wear dresses.  Then after I had changed he rescinded his comment, but my mom was busy picking out something else, which happened to be a shirt that i hate, but haven't thrown out.  Then it was announced we weren't going and I was banished to my room.  I happily went, but Kay came to bother me and I slammed the door in her face. This pissed off my already pissed dad who has decided that grounding me for 3 weeks is a good idea...So guess what, I'm grounded through exam week.  So much for getting to see all my friends from camp on the 13th. Oh, and I still get to sit for pictures.
