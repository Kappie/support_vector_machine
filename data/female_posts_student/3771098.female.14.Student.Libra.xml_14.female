Well, i sit down determined to start this stupid book, and once i get to chapter three, i'm asleep. Now thats when you know it's truly a bad book. Mi Madre made chiken quesadillas tonight. they were yummy. My dad is still trying to change my flight. It's being a real bitch though.   So all i really did today was sleep in, eat some real food, and watch tv ( i tried to read, but it just wasn't working out). Tonight i got to talk to some irmites who i haven't seen or talked to in ages it seems. It was really cool. It's funny talking to people whoyou've known since you were like 5. They knew you when you looked like a total idiot in elm. school, and they've seen you in your absolute best and worst times, yet they still love you anyway. So overall it was a pretty good day. Tomorrow i get to go shopping for a new dress for church because i'm a lector on sunday, and mi madre won't let me wear my other dress because my boobs grew and now i have crazy cleavage (which isn't that great of a thing might i add). And i've got to look for back to school clothes because i absolutely can't wear my shorts (aka my underwear) to school. Then i've got tursday nights at church which means yay for liz b/c i can get copies of pictures from people from the trip. Then me and amez are going to the bowling alley with some of her friends and hopefully they'll be some hot guys there. Well that's 'bout it guys. And oh yeh, one more thing.. In steven's words "Lets go back to South Dakota." Amen my friend- well i'm out.  Liz
