Why don't you just leave it at "LadyNeptune" or somethin', Summer and I think Dollface already made references to you by that name.  Yes...I was supposed to come up with some form of hang out, Dollface, but my raging incompetence and lack of recreational knowledge makes coming up with something to do, real difficult.  Conrad...that new"Phantom" thing seems kinda...suspicious...I don't trust the whole thing for some reason.  If it's possible, I think I'm experiencing boredom, or just lots of exasperation, think I might just be loosing my mind. I'f I'm off the grip, realign them according to standardized specs.  We're all just their machines with an oil change. Hey, anyone wanna hang?  I'm Deadinside and that's my subtle hint for today.  "Eating is like, the only disorder that seems to be disgusting. I mean, yeah with drugs and alcohol, women are like, 'Oh yeah, that guy's like, a bad boy, I wanna be with him', or something like that. But with food...you never see a woman say, 'Oh you see that guy with the triple-cheeseburger with drips of grease streaming down his face? I want him.'"
