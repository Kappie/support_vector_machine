I've had training this week... it's going okay.  The instructor/training guy has been flirting with me a tad.  It's fun to flirt.  I won't have anything the next 2 weeks... then the first 2 weeks of August will be spent going to classes for more training hours for my job.  :)  Oh the fun of summer.  Um, other than that... my 22nd birthday is coming up... July 29th... mark it on your calendar... it's going to be a fun day I hope.  Hmmm... Also, I'm going to the Warped Tour tomorrow... after training  :'(  I hope I don't miss good bands.  Then on Saturday me and my bro are going to see Dave Matthews Band.  :-D  It's going to be great.  There goes my paycheck for training.  :-\  I guess I'll post more later... it could be an interesting night.
