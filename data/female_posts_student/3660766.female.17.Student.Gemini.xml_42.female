I dont even wanna think about the day when im 42. Her birthday made me wonder if im gonna be able to do and have all the things i wanted in my life before i grow old. Im always scared that im gonna get older and never find someone to spend the rest of my life with. That scares me to death. Im also afraid that im not gonna make alot of money. Growing up me and my mom never had alot of money and i dont wanna go thru what my mom did with my family( if i have one lol) Idk i look at my mom sometimes and i wonder if shes happy with how her life turned out. I feel so bad , my mom would have been able to do alot more if she didnt have me, and i feel like i held her back. I know shes not happy, and i wish i could make everything better. To see my mom laugh and smile would be the day. and with her birthday tomorrow shes even more depressed. Ok im done with that topic, its making me all sad lol I got my hair chopped off everyone! Hoooooray! lol My ends were fried bc of my dying habits so i had them hacked off and now my hair is all pretty again! : ) well i am gonna go and tidy up my room so i can have some people over.  :)
