So yeah, is the country birthday, but I don't get the spirit, if you know what I mean. I'm looking forward to watching Singapore Idol than watching the national parade. That's right, I have said it, shoot me....      Is always the same old thing over and over again. Almost routine like. Somehow I have the feeling they are trying to paint a picture perfect thing. Everyone clutching to a Singapore flag, singing national day song., being patriotic Well, it a rare sight, that only happens today.       Oh well, perhaps is just too early in the morning that I'm feeling this way. Hopefully, the national day fever bug will catch me. And yes, I will be watching the national day parade....       Btw, Danny Murphy is leaving for Tottenham. Well, I'm not really surprised, I was wondering when will this day arrives. I mean Murphy is a good player and hardworking. But he is not exactly a fantastic player, if you know what I mean. I always thought he would not last long in Liverpool, but he have surprised me by staying so long. To be fair, he had his days during Houllier's time. Well, all the best to him at Spurs, joining Rednkapp. The ironic thing is Liverpool will be facing Spurs next Saturday, 1st match of the season. Interesting to see how it turns out. But of course, Liverpool will win!
