That is.... until they shoved all the seniors into the gym and started the blabbering about grad... which naturally drives knives into the certain someone vs. someone scratching each others eyes out issue... -scowls- Evil school. They gave us a neat little package detailing what and what not to do during the ceremony and banquet. I found it amusing. Its done point by point, like a military drill... thats Mr. Rice for you. "No gum chewing." ... "Tassels on your left. Don't touch them." ... "Do not leave the room." (I can just see them stating loudly halfway through the commencement "Well Susie you should have thought about using the bathroom EARLIER" hah...)  It goes on like that until you reach the Banquet page, and it starts to tell you how to eat. -rolls eyes- oh boy. But ANYHOW the food sounds good, "Roasted Chicken Breast Sante-Fe with Zesty Tomato Sauce, Mousseline Potato and Seasonal Vegetables." heh... but the desert passes that by far. "Strawberry Ice Souffle with a Liquid Passion Fruit Centre and a Chunky Chocolate Flan Wedge." AND (not OR.. its an AND) "Caramel Cheesecake on a Brown Sugar Cinnamon Shortbread with Raspberry Caramel Sauce."  Sooo, anyone in the City June 3rd and 4th?? Feel free to come -coughs- its $40.00 cnd and formal attire is mandatory, but the foods good! -scowls some more- I have until May 7th to drag as many people as I think needful along with me.  And.. we get to keep our caps, (I'm not sure if this is regular practice or not, I've never heard of it).... We were thinking it over during lunch today..and could just imagine our kids later down the line finding this silly caps and asking "Mommy, whats this?" "Its the cap from my highschool grad gown/ceremony." "Really!!!.."...momentary silence... "You had UGLY school colors Mommy!" (for those who don't know, our school colors are orange and brown.. ICK)  So I'm going to go resume the moping around over grad for a bit then I guess I'm goin to a movie and the cheap theatre... yaah.... or something... hmm bleh... ah well... new day tomorrow....  Did I mention the headache monster has set upon me again? Anyone with a convienient guillotine about... gimme a ring...
