I swear, if i dont fail science Ill be surprised. I just hope my parents dont find out or ask....cause ill be in DEEEEP shit. And nobody likes standing in a pile of shit.  I had the coolest dream last night... i read smack before i went to bed and so i had this awesome dream. I was in some sort of house, and i was doing a bunch of heroin and dylan was there, and just... everything was so intensely awesome. And then i woke up and the arm that i had been doing the heroin in was completely numb (and i wasnt laying on it or anything) and it was cool.  Huh. According to thespark.com, I'm pregnant. And my baby will have a birth defect because it will have a dime sticking out of the side of its head. How cute. Especially since babies are UUUUUGLY. And fat. And stupid. Stupid babies.  GAH! school is stupid. EVERYTHING IS STUPID.  *All i want for christmas is my two front teeth. And some mistletoe all up in this piece, maybe a girl... one thats free of disease, and while im thinkin... throw in a couple of g's.... we smell like evergreens* IF YOU DONT LISTEN TO MC CHRIS, YOU DAMN WELL SHOULD. Or.. uh... something really horribly bad will happen to you. Ten year olds will come running after you with a chainsaw and a bottle of Robotussin.  Ka-ZAM!
