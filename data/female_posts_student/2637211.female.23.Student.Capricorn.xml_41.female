I'm glad that more in the Republican party are admitting that Bush's policies are harmful to our country and that these are scary idealogues, not policy makers. Now the moderates that Cheney fired are fighting back, and the press is loving it. I'm hoping for a Clinton-sized scandal here, but what with the conservative media, who knows. Luckily, I try to get news from the liberal media.... :)  Christie Whitman:  urlLink Op-Ed Contributor: The Vital Republican Center   Paul O'Neill:  urlLink Salon.com: He Cannot Tell a Lie
