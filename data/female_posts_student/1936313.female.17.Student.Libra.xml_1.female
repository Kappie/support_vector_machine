Went out to Liverpool for starts.. to the Museum.. which was okay until it became packed with schoolchildren (its the week before spring break for them, so they all go on their funny school trips...) loads of information on the Blitz and WWII which is what we're studying in Social Class.... I'll have all this newfound info on the Blitz and we aren't even really studying it in any detail... grrrr....  Drove off to Southport after Liverpool... you can see Blackpool from Southport.... I dunno.. kinda hard to describe Southport.. don't quite have the energy to try.... it seemed....fake to me... like a mini-Blackpool... kinda.. shady or something... lots of quaint little bookshops though... my kinda heaven... even if its seedy...  Tomorrow we're off to some Quary or something.... early in the morning (I'm going to die!! Finally just getting off the jetlag) its supposed to be something like Fort Edmonton park back home... and somewhere in there we're supposed to be visiting Uncles and Aunts of my Dads whom I have no idea who they are and have never met..... (Plus side to this... If I've never met them.. they can't tell me how much I've grown... hehe... though I'm sure there will be some variable on that.... blah.. ah well...)  Dads birthdays on Saturday.. still trying to find him something for his birthday.. not having any luck.. any ideas? Anybody? Let me know!!!!
