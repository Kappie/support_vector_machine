We are getting 326 new freshman this year which is the largest our school has ever had. U must remember, my school have a tops of like a 1000 students so 326 more kids is alot to us. I am in a Senior group of Krissy, Rachael, Heather, Angie, and then the boys with us are Jermemy, Tony, and their friends, these are the same boys that went to germany with me. They were so funny so this should be fun. Our group is gonna win in being the craziest lol Well after F.O i am gonna come home and get some sleep bc a group of us are going to Kings Island on Sunday. Im excited about that! : )
