I promised Jenny that I'd bring her pictures for the portrait pages and spent $10 getting two roles developed in one hour.  only 2 of the pictures are decent and the rest is essentially trash.  I can't wait for my b-day because I know I'm getting a digital camera.  In fact I can have it tonight if I want it, but that means nothing to be opened on my birthday.  Can I wait 3 weeks?  Oh and who ever took the pictures of our massive huddle did a crappy job of setting up the shots (which did develop properly)....
