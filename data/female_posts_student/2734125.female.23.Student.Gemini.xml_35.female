I restate that this blog is for class, or started for class.  Thus, when such topics come down from on high...  I was talking with one of my peers the other day during a break in class and he was talking about what a blog is.  It is not, he claims, what it claims to be: this is not a journal.  A journal, by definition, is something more private.  For me my current journal is a black leather book sitting by my bed recording the things that I need recorded and that I have no other outlet for.  My classmate claimed then that these blogs are in fact soap boxes, a space in which you blindly rant to unknown people about your own experience.  It seems like there is a level of that.  I would agree that this is a forum for ranting, and a space to state your piece with out the self consciousness of being in front of people- having no real way to gage their reactions you are free to create whatever your own reality dictates is acceptable.  It is a strangely safe medium.  I am aware, personally, of a strange thrill that is derived from others having information about me that even those that know me closely may not.  It is also a strange mark in my mind that I do not know which people have this information.  In a way it makes me more centered.  While there is always a level of remediation, we are always expressing ourselves in a series of layered metaphors, true meaning not even really known to ourselves, having another level of exposure to people makes me feel like being truer to myself during everyday interaction.  Sarah says, "So, it seems to me that we all need to define our own identity, and then explore that identity in relation to an audience invoked or implied."  Identity is a constant progression- to define it would be at once attempting to limit it and instantly making it wrong.  The fluidity of identity is what keeps me sane- to attempt to prescribe to one definition of self is to set yourself up for that definition being wrong- and then what?  Well...   And then there is the issue of audience.  I must have an idea of audience.  There are things that I have wanted to write and have not, things that I did not want about my life or my experiences that are held back from a potencially public domain.  However, I don't really have any clue.  I know some friends read it, as I sent out the link- but I don't know really which friends.  I know that some class mates that I would gladly consider friends likely read it.  But then there is an odd unknown element as well that lead to the fact that anyone could be reading it.  In a random wandering some government official could have stumbled upon it and made it a book mark for spying on the college perspective... I don't have a fucking clue who reads this.  Another interesting event, social convention: I know that people are reading each other's online journals... but there is a hesitancy in mentioning it to anyone.  I would not ask someone about something that I read about in their journal, no matter how curious I am, unless it came up directly in conversation.  There is a private knowledge, a feeling of power that comes from the knowledge.    Clearly I have yet to get into my political views.  Defining myself seems somehow painful.... I write here much about what I think, how I view things, the spaces in my life that are some how separated out from the drone of background noise that reality can become.  In a way I am writing to make those moments real, to possibly make them resonate with unknown bodies sitting in front of unknown computers in lives and situations that I will never know the full intricacy of.  This, however, this controversial dip into my mind, leaves me more exposed.  What I have written about so far are things that I am aware are my own... And if you don't like them it doesn't matter.  If it makes you uncomfortable, or pleased, or mad, or hateful, or strangely confused, really I don't care.  They are reaching out to you, and I am satisfied with that reaching- but they are not for you.  However, with a statement that is overtly political you are setting yourself automatically in opposition to others.  This is not a soft hazy thing- this is creating other to define yourself.  It is also overtly combative, and I don't really want to expose my combative side to people that I have no chance to have a dialogue with.  You see, when we are going into battle, and politics have been framed as such, it seems cowardly and silly to state your feelings with out any chance of anyone coming back at you.  The point of making statements about politics is to have other people question, confirm, debate and engage you in the discussion.  Thus it is a fight, and it is also a growing experience.  An attempt to define myself in a manifesto of political stance seems to be setting myself up for stagnation.  That, and I am a chickenshit.  Yes, this is a surreal medium that allows for little interaction with audience and less knowledge of who is reading what, thus more freedom, but it also has the chance of having very real consequences in "real life."  I am not declining as of yet, but I need to put some more thought into how I want to frame myself here, how I want to tie the knots in my noose, how I want the grave to be shaped.  If I am going to go in to definition, I want it to be on my own terms.  This is long, but there is more.  This is the more that I am interested in.  Yesterday had a blur of little sleep and layering knowledge that has not occurred for a while.  My dreams fell in shards.  I was drawn into places that I have not been, maybe ever.  Thought and action and contemplating and emotion.  They blended in a new way yesterday.  Yesterday felt like a new chapter in the alchemy of soul.  Not a life changing forever shift- more based on the assumption that nothing is really coincidence when it comes to it- the weird mix of sleeplessness and splintered dreams, and cold and hot and sweat and tea and sound and quiet were utterly unique.  I've written too much today, and it takes to much energy to stay vaguely neutral in my description.  Damn it.  I'll try again some other time, when the understandings have crystallized and formed truly.  Then maybe I can express the dance- right now not so.
