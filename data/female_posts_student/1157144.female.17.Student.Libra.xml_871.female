Well he talks to this chick that sits at the freshman table at art so I am going to try to get in with her so that I can walk with her maybe sometime in the future and he will walk with her too so THEN MAYBE I will be in closer proximity to him than the previous 5 feet or more.  Well of course I am not all too serious about this, but it is way more entertaining than listening to Jessica eat my ear off about why she doesn't like Anne or Anne eat my ear off about condiments and dinner utensils.  Oh and to anyone who is interested: There is a show this Saturday that I believe many of you would fine quite interesting.  Jason Webley, the cool Accordian player from Seattle is coming, and he gives a very crowd involved show where you get to dance, bang empty bottles,sing along, and spin in circles! Also, the Suburban Legends are playing, and for those of you who have not seen this band, you should, because they are energetic ska, with like 7 people, who do choreographed dance moves, flip over eachother, and random acrobats on stage. MIGHTY ENTERTAINING!! For those of you who (especially) are avoiding an emo-kid show, this is definately not one of those, so let the good times roll. =)   Oh, and P.S. That wasn't meant to come off as all-knowing or anything, since I am well aware certain of you are already going and all, but I felt that the general term "show" may imply something less extraordinary and did not do specifically these 2 bands justice.    END
