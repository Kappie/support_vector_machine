I'm on neopets right now b/c I'm bored. do you think walmart would be open today? I want to go buy some yarn.  anyhow. need to go buy pressies on neopets cuz I've been a huge lazy bum and didn't buy anything. except for a vortex negg for meng, and that's because that's not even unbuyable.  gosh. there are major money-making sharks on the tp and auction chat. though there is a babyca being sold right now for 360k... I really really want it, but I must learn self control. :(  yeah. anyhow. kailing! get on so I can neomail you instead of typing like this.  I have a feeling this will be a major pain in the arse to read.  hehe  ++sunny
