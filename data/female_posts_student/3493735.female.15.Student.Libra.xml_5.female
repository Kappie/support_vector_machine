Then i took a little swim then i came home and had a nice convo with my cousin! then me my mom and my sisters went out to eat and then stopped at Kohl's got some bra's and cheer shorts and a couple of shirts then headed to get some ice cream then came home. I got online and now i'm here. I didn't get a certain phone call today uh huh sure sure nice try though! can i say all talk no play?!

Well so i'm bored out of my mind and wicked thirsty so i'm gonna go get a drink i guess i'll talk to you all later!   -Tori
