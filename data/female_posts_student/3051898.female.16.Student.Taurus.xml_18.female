I'm sure most people know the feeling of when everything seems to be going wrong and it seems like everyone just wants to make your life that little bit worse. Okay so things aren't THAT serious. But today felt pretty crap. I have a boyfriend who doesn't trust me and thinks I lie all the time (I'm actually very against lying) and it feels like my friends are turning against me. I could explain everything about me and my boyfriend (as I mentioned in my last post, called Chris) but I'll probably ramble on about him enough in other posts. One thing that's really been bothering me lately is Stephen... I miss him. No he hasn't gone anywhere. He lives just down the road from me, yet I haven't seen him in quite a while. He's coming online less and less often and when he does he doesn't really talk to me. He spends more time with my next-door neighbour (Laura, we're both friends with her) and I just feel left out... It also annoys me that the few times Stephen does come here he wants to call for Laura. I know that the reason he spends so much time with Laura is because she plays football with him... and football doesn't interest me. Even so, I can't help but feel rejected that he calls her and makes plans and he never calls me anymore. I end up seeing them outside togther... and he never wants to call for me. It's upsetting, me and Ste used to be really gud mates, but I've never felt so distant to him as I do now.  Similarly, Laura is talking to me a bit less (on msn). In fact she's talking to Chris more. She tells me to dump Chris, even though they are friends (only because of me...) and even though if I did she would still talk to him on msn. She wants me to dump him because he can be really mean to me considering he's supposed to be nice as I'm his girlfriend! Depressingly enough he's probably nicer to Laura than me... Something that annoys me about Laura is the way she thinks she's right all the time. Actually that's similar to Chris. They both reckon they're always right. They don't even properly admit they're wrong when I have presented them with evidence that proves them wrong... it's so irritating.  Another person who keeps telling me to dump Chris is Lauren. Don't get me wrong, Laurens a lovely friend... I was annoyed yesterday when she signed in on msn as me though! She really shouldn't be doing that. I could've got really mad but I didn't. I changed my password anyway so she won't be doing that again. Today Lauren got all upset and started crying... all starting from me observing Alison was wearing a short miniskirt so I said it was a bit slutty... Lauren defended her saying it wasn't (Lauren often wears short skirts and revealing tops herself - yes we say she dresses sluttily). Anyway, we ended up not talking for a while... I felt as though they were both picking on me moaning at me, as I hadn't meant to offend anyone, I did mean it jokily. It was playing on the sims that really brought things back to normal, I'm glad me and Lauren are getting on okay. Though it was her who said sorry to me, and now I feel it's my turn to say sorry. I should've said this at the time, but I didn't... I guess I didn't want to admit this in person. I'll say it now because I think Lauren will read this.  Lauren, I'm really sorry for the way I say you dress like a slut. Of course you aren't a slut, I know you're not like that. When it comes to boys you're a good girl (usually :P)! So why do I say it then? As I explained at the time, sluts would also wear revealing clothes... but there's a bit more to it than that. I could say something like I'm concerned guys will get the wrong idea and something bad will happen, but the chances of that are slim. So I'll tell you a more real reason... I'm jealous. You have great legs, a nice stomach (no matter what you say you are NOT fat!), and a generally great body. The truth is that I know that if I wore the clothes you wear I wouldn't be able to look anywhere near as good! I don't even have such clothes to wear, so I can't even try to compete anyway. I'm really sorry. When I do say you're slutty I really don't mean to upset you... If it really does upset you that much I'll stop... it's just when you're dressed like that I feel like I must look terrible next to you. Please forgive me?  Moving on... I'll talk about Alison, who was taking offence at my comment today... I was sure she knew I was joking. Either way she said sorry so I'll also say sorry. I don't know if Alison will read this because it's so long, but if she does then i want to say this to her... Sorry Alison I didn't mean to make you feel upset. I really did mean it in a jokey way.  And now Louise, she's been great lately. Sometimes she gets on my nerves when I'm in a bad mood, but I know she doesn't mean too. Louise, if you read this then I want to say to you that I'm sorry I get so mad over stupid things, please don't get upset when I'm like this as I just need a bit of time to let off steam.  I now realise I've mentioned a lot of people... and I guess I've also realised that the world isn't picking on me. As usual it's just a few things upsetting me and I'm blowing it all out of proportion and taking it out on everyone else. Well I need to finish this post soon, so I'll finish by mentioning Rachel. With everything thats been going on, I still feel most sorry for Rachel. She might not always be nice, but you can still have fuun with her. I know she spends a lot of time feeling upset as she thinks many things are her fault that aren't... I realise me and Rachel have had a good share of arguments, but I really do wish her all the happiness in the world. It's not fair that she should be so upset all the time and I wish I could help her. Whenever I talk to her I always feel so helpless because there's nothing I can do to cheer her up. I don't think Rachel will read this... but if she does hopefully she'll feel just a little bit happier to know I really do care about her.  That's all for tonight then. I didn't mention my family (who were being nice today until my sister, Lisa, discovered I accidentally cut my leg while shaving and I was using her razor...) but perhaps next time.  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx
