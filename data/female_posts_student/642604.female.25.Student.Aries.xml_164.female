Went out to mom's yesterday, packed up tobey and took him with me.  I figured if I lost power at least I could actually hang out with someone other than my dog.  But the thing is the more I talked to people on the phone after we lost power out there I figured there was a good chance I still had power at my apartment.  So I packed up my dog yet again and drove back to the apartment and have been hanging out with lights and dvds ever since.  My cable modem and cable television finally came back on so now I am completely back up and running.
