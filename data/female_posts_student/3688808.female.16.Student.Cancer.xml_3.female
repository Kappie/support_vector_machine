I stayed up until 12.30 with Len while he wished me a happy birthday (many times) =D Then finally went to bed! I woke up that morning at about 11am (Yes...4 hours too early for me) and was in the happiest mood I'd ever been in! (Even happier than that random day last year in History when I literally fell off of my chair and banged my head on the corner of the table with laughter, and I can't even remember what I was laughing at =\)   I woke up, put on my dressing gown and walked downstairs expecting to be bombarded with "HAPPY BIRTHDAY"'s from my family but nobody was in. I soon got over it. I wacked the TV on, flicked over to the music channels and turned it up  FULL BLAST!  Then I danced around like a motherfucker for about an hour before Nikki came over to give me my card. I still wasn't dressed! We had a little chat and talked about Chris's car...Snazzay!=D Nikki had handmade me this gorgeous blue card, it was amazing! I don't know if it's just me but I think handmade cards are alot more personal than store bought ones. That's why I was so happy when she gave it to me.   After Nikki had gone, Kirsty gave me my card. She'd been hiding upstairs for about an hour making it. She'd glittered it up and put a little plastic bottle of champagne inside. I laughed my ass off, but I'll keep those cards forever.   Then mum came home and gave me my card from her  Nidhal (she'd signed it from him but...whatever)...I opened it and discovered £40! Wow...I'm rich! Then Nidhal came home from work and gave me a tenner. He apologised for not buying me a gift...but all I wanted was the money.   My mum then asked me (on my god damn BIRTHDAY) to wash the dishes, but I was in such a good mood, I thought; fuck it, I'll do them! My response was; "HELL YEAH I'LL WASH THE DISHES!"   So...I washed them, still in my pyjamas, while dancing around to Outkast-Roses! I go crazy whenever that song comes on, I swear! Then my aunty and my nanna came around and gave me my presents. I was a little shocked to see my nanna after all of that shit that went on between us, but fuck it...it's in the past now!   My aunty gave me a gorgeous watch (which is handy because I needed a new one) and a new make-up set (which is handy because I REALLY needed that!) My nanna gave me 20 L, a tenner and a golden dolphin necklace with real diamonds in it...I went crazy!   By then, I still wasn't dressed. My aunty and nanna left and then it was  PARTY TIME BABY!  At 7pm, I met Shelley, Rich, Faye, Kerry, Leigh-Anne, Liam, Vinni  Zoë around at Rich's and Shelley gave me my card from her, Zoë, Kerry and Leigh-Anne. I'd stupidly worn my heels even though I knew we were going down the meadows so Shelley and I legged it back to mine so that I could change into my trainers. We ran back around to meet everyone else and Rich went to buy the booze. Shelley bought me a bottle of Irn Brew VK and I spazzed out. I was just so unbelievably happy!   Then we went down the meadows and sat around drinking in the rain for about two hours. There were some lads that none of us knew, they were about 12 and they kept hogging the rope swing. Shelley (one of the nicest people I know) eventually got pissed out of her face and started ripping these 12-year-olds. "Why ya sittin'in the tree? Are ya watchin' for pirates?". Shelley and Zoë were being evil to the kids, but then Grant and Briggsy came down and started playfighting with one of the kids. But then they made his head bleed...so they stopped!   I pissed myself with laughing down the meadows! It was so much fun! Grant, Liam and Briggsy borrowed my lighter and started a fire in the forest. There was so much fucking smoke but no fire!   It was pissing it down so we all took off up to the Vanish. Rich and us girls went into the Vanish and played pool! All of us girls were being eyed up by some perv sitting in the corner. Zoë and Leigh-Anne went home and so did Faye, so Rich, Kerry, Shelley and me went to stand in the bus stop out of the rain. Grant, Vinni and Liam were all standing in the opposite bus stop so they came and joined us.   They spent ages quoting lines from Snatch, Shelley, Kerry and me were proper bored! Then fucking DICKHEAD Chris appeared out of nowhere and started talking about the time that Laura gave him a blow-job in the middle of the street. Grant saw and ran over to Shelley's screaming   "SHELLEY! LET ME IN...OH MY FUCKING GOD SHELLEY LET ME IN!"   he he   Anyways, then the 737 to Chesterfield came past and Briggsy dared Grant to prank the bus driver. Grant stuck out his hand and when the bus pulled over Grant looked in and said "Allr8 youth, when's the last bus?"..."11.00"..."Allrite then...thanks...bye!"    He deserved it! He's a bus driver!    Yeah, so then I went home and came on MSN for a while...then I took residence in my lovely bed!=D   Woke up this morning to find that Len had txted me! YEY! Got a bit excited there =P Did my History exam this morning, fun =\...then went shopping with Bex for my birthday present! Got a gorgeous bag and purse! Thanks Bexieeeeee   Hehe, I think I've said more than enough =P Asta xXx
