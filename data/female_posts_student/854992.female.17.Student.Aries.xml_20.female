(pause) It was just weird, because that had never happened before and I was unprepared. Plus, I didn't have my  faggot-y redneck-repellant gear  on that day!"  "Frank Sinatra has passed on the torch to me. but little did he know that  he'd be passing it on to a  gay opera queen "   "I've developed into quite a swan. I'm one of those people that will probably look better and better as I get older, until I drop dead of beauty."   "All of you girly singing boys: Come out of the woodwork. Don't be scared, it's OK, you can sing. We'll start some sort of  war between the gangsta rappers and the little singing boys."   "I really fall for straight guys...I almost like it more. This is terrible but basically, I just don't want to be married. Unless it's really exciting. I just like the thrill of the chase more than getting the prize itself.  I like to be a bit of the shit disturber...the home wrecker, the whore, the bad guy. "  "Wait , hold on, I gotta start the bridge again, I forgot the words. uh.  cause  I was thinking of the naked boy ."   "This is about forbidden love of  cowboys, cause you know they're all fucking each other, the minute you turn your back."   "But Sting's 16-year-old son is so gorgeous - he brought him out last night - now  I'm dying to be friends with Sting so I can molest his children "   "I was in the forest jumping around daffodils while everyone was high on heroin."   "I usually wake up around three and  sit at the piano completely naked  and play for two or three hours. That gets the juices flowing. Then I dress and go eat after starving myself. I wait until I'm completely delirious. I can't say that Twenty-third Street is my favorite area, so I'd walk with  my very low blood sugar all the way to Tompkins Square Park and,  on the edge of death, order some pirogue . It's a good way to stay thin."    "My butt doesn't HAVE any complaints"  - Rufus before singing 'Complainte de la Butte'  "I went to see Moulin Rouge last night and  I want to be in the sequel where Ewan McGregor realizes he's gay and we can do a duet together  on top of the Eiffel Tower or something."     What excites you the most?   "Looking at myself at a distance, naked, in a mirror: but only at a distance."    What is your favorite journey?   "Down some boy's pants!"    Where is the most exciting place you've ever had sex?   It was in a car and it was really good and the windows got all fogged up and that was kind of hot.     What would you most likely be arrested for doing?   Having sex in a car!    Which of your accomplishments are you most proud of?   I would have to say my hair.   Gotta love Rufus...
