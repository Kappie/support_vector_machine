Who You Are  You have a special zeal for life  You're a very balanced person. You have a talent for seeing beyond the details of day-to-day life. You refuse to settle long-term for a boring job or doing something just because it's expected of you. Love is the same way. Despite your natural charm, you can't pretend to care for someone if you're missing a deep connection. You're a secret romantic, even if you'd feel too silly to admit it. You're ready and able to experience romance and a powerful "spark" with someone special. Your biggest challenge may be finding time to connect given your busy (and often frantic) life.    What's dating all about to you?  You believe dating and life in general is about learning and growing as a person. You have a great skill for connecting with people, so dating comes relatively easily to you. However, it's hard for you to have a real intellectual connection with an attractive man. Hopefully, you've found a way to "go with the flow" in dating as you already do in other parts of your life.   You face two major challenges in finding the love of your life. First, because your mind is so busy making sure you say and do the right things on dates, it's hard for your deeper and caring self to come through. It feels risky to share this part of yourself. Second, although having a vision of what you want can be helpful, the risk is that your high standards can get in the way of loving a real-life imperfect man.    Here's how you compare with other women your age            How unique is your type?  Your personality profile is similar to a number of women your age. Looking at over 10,000 women who have taken the test, about 5% (or 1 in 20 women) have very similar beliefs, values, and habits. Of course, the way these qualities are expressed in you is what makes you so unique.   How many other women have personalities like you?    Quirks men notice  Like all women, you have your strengths as well as your quirks and shortcomings. Ultimately, you want to find someone who will love and accept you "warts and all." Though you have lots of friends, it's important to have at least one person in your life who understands.   You have a pretty even-tempered personality and may not have any especially annoying or quirky habits. Of course, seeming to be "perfect" could be seen as a flaw by some, in which case you may just want to pretend to have a bad habit!  Do men like your type?  Notice that 41% of men are generally attracted to your personality type. 3% say they are VERY attracted. With the millions of people on Match.com, that translates into lots of potential matches.   How many men are attracted to your type?       Who You're Looking For   He'll be an enigma  You're looking for a man who can be your soul mate AND playmate in life! He has a wide variety of interests and an insatiable curiosity about life. Though he has both close friends and a broader group of buddies to hang out with, he's also very independent. So it may be a little hard to get to know him, especially emotionally. But it's worth the effort! You'll never be bored, since he stays busy with outdoor activities, community involvement, and hobbies and will encourage you to be active too.   You don't expect your partner to be in a good mood all the time. You understand that sometimes your partner will be down, get pessimistic or worry too much. These days are balanced by the many good days the two of you will share. In fact, you share a number of positive qualities, including:    No strong similarities were detected, which suggests that you may be more attracted to certain "opposite qualities." Please read the next sections to see if you may be seeking someone with different or opposite qualities to balance your own habits and style.  Here's how you compare to your "ideal" partner           Number of men your type Men with the exact type of personality you prefer are rare gems. Looking at over 10,000 men who have taken this test, only 10% (or 1 in 10 men) have the exact combination of similarities and contrasts in personality you find extremely appealing.   However, there's a larger group, 34% (or 1 in 3 men), who have most, but not all, of the qualities and habits you like. These subgroups are charted below.   Approximately two-fifths of the men have at least some of the traits you find attractive.   But you'd have a negative reaction to 5% (or 1 in 20 men), who have some or many of the characteristics you clearly dislike.   How many men are your "ideal" type?    Finding someone like you  You want to share your life with someone who has the same values, goals, and style you have. Research has shown that couples who have more in common tend to stay together longer. The qualities you find attractive (and unattractive) in men suggest you would certainly be happier with a man who's more like you.   No very strong opposites were detected, which suggests that you are most attracted to men who are very similar to you. This is good news since similar couples tend to stay together longer.  Quirks you can tolerate  The truth is that everyone is potentially "high maintenance." We all have our quirks and shortcomings. The key to long-term harmony is finding a man who can tolerate (or maybe even enjoy) your "quirks," or the little personal oddities that make you unique. You seem okay with several common quirks that might come along with your "ideal" man:   You described a pretty balanced person as most attractive to you, so no strong quirks were noted. Watch out for quirks during dating, since they may indicate a strong quality that is hidden at first.  Downside of your "ideal"  In addition to his quirks, your "ideal" personality type may have other qualities that are more frustrating or challenging to deal with. Under stress, his quirks can become serious "flaws." But remember, these quirks are the "flip side of the coin," or the extreme end of qualities you otherwise find appealing. So, be prepared if:   Because you're most attracted to men with balanced personalities, no troubling differences were noted. Nevertheless, remember that too much similarity can lead to conflict as well, especially when problems call for very different perspectives or actions.  Deal breakers  You seem ready to adapt to the good and frustrating qualities of the men you're looking for, but there are types of men you clearly do NOT like. Men's habits and attitudes you'd have a hard time putting up with include:   Your responses suggest that you are pretty accepting and tolerant of shortcomings. No major personality "deal breakers" or reasons to rule out potential dates were identified.  Trade-offs you'll face  Good Qualities Challenging Qualities  Tries to balance spending time with a few close friends and going out with a big group of friends.  Given the demands of family, friends, and activities, it's hard to find time alone together.   Comes up with lots of great ideas about how to do things better or improve the world.  Creative ideas are often impractical or unrealistic.   Tries to balance an objective view of problems with compassion for the people and feelings involved.  Competing drives from your rational vs. compassionate points of view can stand in the way of making decisions.   Not afraid to make tough decisions and move ahead.  Jumps too quickly to make decisions, because waiting is so hard to do.      Sex  Romantic sex  Good sex is important to you, but it's only one of many ways you connect with your partner. To you, life is about finding balance, and a romantic and satisfying sex life is a key part of your vision.   Among women your age, your particular combination of sexual drive and interests is similar to about 1 in 10 women (10%).   Is he sexually compatible?  You're looking for someone just like you, who values the quality of sex over the quantity. You want someone who would never pressure you about sex.   What's ahead for you sexually?  A good sexual match plays a key role in your "ideal" relationship. If you can bring your natural creativity and imagination to the bedroom, your sex life will never be boring. It may be so good and seem so natural that you'll be shocked when sexual miscommunication or lack of interest occurs. You're prone to worry and read a lot into situations. Don't panic! You're very intuitive, so you're especially sensitive to bumps in the road. Fortunately, you also bring good problem solving skills and rational thinking to the relationship. A good man will understand your need for reassurance and may be willing to meet you half way sexually.   How you and your "ideal" partner compare         Attraction Science  What is personality? Personality is the set of traits and characteristics that make each of us unique yet relatively stable and consistent over time.  - People see and interpret the world differently. - They want different things. - They make decisions differently. - They get excited and energized by different situations. - They structure their careers, social life, and private time in different ways.  What does personality have to do with attraction? The way in which people are similar or different in personality strongly affects their attraction to one another. Two people with similar values are more likely to become (and stay) friends or a couple, indeed part of compatibility is having "common ground." However, for many people, compatibility may also involve a balance between each other's quirks and differences.   Where did the test come from?
