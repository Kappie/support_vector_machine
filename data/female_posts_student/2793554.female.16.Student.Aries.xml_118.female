If your name contains numbers, you'll need to convert them to letters first before you can convert to numbers. k=11 i=9 l=12 l=12 a=1 g=7 e=5 n=14 e=5 r=18 a=1 t=20 i=9 o=15 n=14 2). Add all of the numbers together to create a kind of super number. 153 3). Make a note of the first digit of this number, then add the digits of the number together. 9 5). Take the digit you noted in step 3, and count that many words into the post. 9= life 6). Use the resulting word in a Google Image Search, and select a picture from the first page.  7). Post the results for us all to see. Ya big freak     uh. yeah. there you all go.
