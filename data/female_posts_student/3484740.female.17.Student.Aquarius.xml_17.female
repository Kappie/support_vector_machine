At least, the only cat I've ever had that I could call my own. Twinkee found his collar on the side of the road about half a mile from my house. The weird thing was, he brought it, thinking it might be mine...and didn't say anything to me about it for like 30 minutes after we met up at the pool. Then he was like, hey I found a cat collar. And I was like, oh yea...thinking we could put it on the little kitty of Kerrys that has now moved in, and I turned around to look, and knew it was mine by all the fray he had caused from scratching it. I like freaked out then, and was like where did you find it and everything. We had been looking for Peaches before then, mom was out looking for him and everything, and I just brushed it off, oh...he'll come back, don't worry. Sad thing is, he isn't coming back. He might, I suppose. But if he got attacked, I think he would have made it home by now, he wasn'tfar from home, so I don't think he's coming back. I mean, this kind of thing happens.   Thats about all I guess. School starts in like 2 weeks, I'm so ready, but I'm really not. Last year, its really scary. This is going to be a very weird year. We have someone moving into our house, which will make it even more weird. But fun I hope. As long as I don't get tired of him being around. But we'll see. Anyway, wish me luck on Peaches...!
