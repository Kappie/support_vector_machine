This is usually the time I run into almost every single one of my 'online buddies', but to my dismay not a one is currently online. Either I really am crazy, the bump on my head from my accident left more of a lasting impression then at first believed, or everyone else I know has some sort of a life. I bet more on the last of the options rather than the first two, but I can not say for sure.  Las Vegas was overall a fun and enjoyable trip. The traveling group consisted of me, Tony, Nicole, Josh, Bobb, Jeremy, Ryan, April, and a few others that I do not know and honestly can�t remember their names. We left Friday night and returned home Sunday evening. The original intention was to venture to Sin City in celebration of Tony�s 24th Birthday, but along with that we had fun getting into trouble while we were there. I am sure all who went will agree with me on that.  Anyways�not a lot to comment on at the moment but I thought I should write something. As hard as I try, I am not sure I am capable of writing in a �profound� manner. But nothing is around to try and stop me, so I might as well try, right?
