She can't - without risk of losing her job. The idiot smoked pot the other night, and of course they will require a pee test. Considering her boyfriend went through the same thing less than a year ago, you would think she'd have learned and stayed away from the stuff. Of course, though, the folly of youth is that 'it can't happen to me'. So now it has happened to her, and if she seeks treatment, she will have to pay for it out of her own pocket or risk losing her job. STUPID! STUPID! STUPID!
