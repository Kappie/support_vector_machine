From an e-mail I got this morning:  Dear Rose Caraway:  It is our pleasure to inform you that your paper, "Post-Embargo Cuba: Economic Implications and the Future of Socialism" has been accepted for presentation in the 24th Annual ILASSA Conference on Latin America to be held February 12th through the 14th, 2004 at the University of Texas at Austin.  ~~~~~~~~~~  Yay!!!  I finally get to present my thesis after a year and a half of labor! Too bad I can only talk about it for 20 minutes...
