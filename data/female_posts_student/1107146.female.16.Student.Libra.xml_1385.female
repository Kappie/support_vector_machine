And I called you after that too, remember???  Anyway, I'm sorry that Alabama wasn't much fun.  Relatives suck, don't they?  Liz, it's nice that your back.  I had no idea where you went in the first place.  But, hi.  Josh, I'm not limiting your coke intake today.  I told you that, like, 6 times.  Your phone sucks.  Get a new one.  So, I went to the library today, and got this book about birthday cakes.  You should see them.  They are amazing.  I'm going to make one for my party...still a while from now, but I need to choose one.  All of the pictures look like...I don't know how to describe it, but I don't know, like, they were drawn, that they aren't an actual edible thing.  So, yeh, if that makes any sense at all.    It's an ardvark-eat-turtle world.
