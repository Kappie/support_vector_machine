My boss of sorts reprimanded me at work on Friday, accusing me of acting "too cool for school."  Well, that is bullshit.  You see, I am so not cool.  I have a fucking blog for christ's sake.  I played dungeons and dragons.  I played live action Vampire the Masquerade in college.  I graduated with a 3.96 and a degree in philosophy.  I am about as cool as Arizona asphalt on an august afternoon.    He also accused me of acting like I know everything.  Which is probably true. But it's hard when you actually do know everything.  Okay, no, I don't really believe that I know everything.  Actually, that's the whole point of this blog. See, I secretly doubt that I know anything at all.  I know I am big old fucking fraud, thus the reference to Stradlater.    Maybe my boss is right, maybe I try too hard in social situations and I come across like an arrogant know-it-all asshole.  But then again, I have also been told that I come across as an insecure dumb bimbo.  I can't seem to get the balance right.  Everyone says, well, instead of trying to come across as something, why don't you just BE YOURSELF.    But that's the whole fucking problem.  There is no "self" for me to be. I am just one big collage of other people's impressions.  The only time I really ever feel like I am being myself is when I am overcome by powerful emotions.  When I play a really rocking song in the car and I'm driving 80 mph and feel like violently turning the steering wheel just because.  Or when I am reading an amazing book and the writing is so good, and the characters are so real and I feel like I want to through myself off a bridge because I will never be able to express that sort of raw emotion in such a beautiful and moving way.  Or when I look over at someone like MR. David, and I am struck by how truly handsome he is and how strong and independent he can be and I realize that I will never be as interesting and admirable as he is.  Then, and only then, do I think I might have found a bottom to all the masks I put on.    But I can't exactly be that "self" in public, now can I?  That would go over just swell at the Firm.  Playing music in my office, full blast, Screaming at the top of my lungs because I am sitting in a big white box surrounded by the dull and the dying.    Now, I know I am being unfair.  I don't expect everyone to be a great artist or to feel uncontainable passion for life or to unrestrainably love and hate the human condition.  People, after all, must live. We must muddle through the mundanity of our lives.  And being a lawyer is no better or worse than any other distraction.  Not to mention, that some of those people really love what they do. They get off on winning trials the same way rock musicians get off on putting on a good show.    I know the real problem is me. My boss, though he happened to put it in simultaneously the most ridiculous and the most infuriating way possible (too cool for school) did touch on a reality.  I HATE MY FUCKING JOB and IT IS ALL MY OWN FAULT. I  do  have an attitude problem.  And it's because I don't have the discipline to suppress all that angst, ennui, etc.    Basically, I have been acting like a teenager.  I either need to 1) learn to love my work, 2) swallow my pride and suck-up and be fake and muddle through my job, or 3) quit.  Because I don't want to be that annoying little fuck of an employee who hates their work, but won't quit and makes everybody else miserable.
