Today's mood weather ::  sunny  Have you ever noticed those crosses and wreaths by the side of the highway or road? You know the ones I mean - the ones that people put up in memory of somebody who died there. Sure, you've seen them. But have you ever really  thought  about them?  You drive by those crosses on a regular basis, never stopping to think that for a split second, you are in the last place one person ever saw. For a split second, you're in the exact same place that somebody was when they died. But nine times out of ten, you don't realize that. You're too caught up in your music, or your conversation, or planning how you're going to meet that big deadline coming up. So next time you see a memorial cross, take the time to think that somebody really died in that spot, the very one you just flew past - alive.    RIGHT NOW    feeling ::  tired but awake...lol  listening to/watching ::  nothing  eating/drinking ::  Dr. Pepper  craving ::  a sonic hot dog...yum  talking to ::  Amanda  thinking about ::  taking Athletic Training this year  wishing ::  nothing  wearing ::  jeans and an Oscar the Grouch t-shirt  random ::  The mail is here!
