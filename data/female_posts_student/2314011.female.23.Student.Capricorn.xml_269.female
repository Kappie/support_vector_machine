I realize we are not all Capricorns, but some of the messages included in my horoscope overlap with the other signs', so just go with it.  Consider yoursevles informed, and on notice.      "You got through July, your toughest month. Rest assured that August will be better and September will be the best month of all. In fact, it could become your very favorite month of the year. Every day, in every way, things are getting better for you.   I saw such heavy aspects for you last month (due to Saturn), with most of the stress centered on a partner or detractor. As a strong, practical Capricorn, you have proven to me that you are able to deal with all sorts of circumstances, including difficult ones, with admirable grace and even ease. I should have been mindful of those qualities in you.   Looking ahead to this month, it's a bit of a mixed bag-but certainly far better than what I saw for you in July!   Mercury, the planet of communication, transportation, commerce and contracts, will be retrograde just about all month long, from August 9 to September 2. That alone will bring down the level of progress any of us can expect to make, because when Mercury retrogrades, it is sleeping and we don't have its beneficial rays to help us assess, communicate or project forward with the same acuity that we are used to.   This doesn't mean you have to come to a grinding halt on all current projects. You can certainly plan, do research, contact others and conduct meetings. I would suggest, however, that you wait to announce final decisions. I will also ask you not to sign any contracts, but other than that, you are free to work as usual. Keep your antenna up for possible changes in strategy or direction, because they often spring up when Mercury is retrograde. Mercury retrograde is like a green light that changed to yellow: Caution is always warranted.   This time, Mercury will retrograde in your ninth house, a part of your chart that rules travel, important relationships with people at a distance, higher education, publishing, broadcasting and legal matters. ( So basically, anything I'm involved in  at all  ) For example, if you are about to start a semester at college or grad school, you may find that some of your favorite classes are unavailable to you. (Sign up as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.) If you ship a package, it could arrive broken or get delayed in customs. ( Already had one of my textbook orders cancelled. ) Have someone professionally pack it for you and make sure the paperwork is letter-perfect. If you plan to travel, show up early at the airport, even though there's a good chance your flight will be late (sad but true). If you are an author, your editor may request lots of revisions. Just shrug and do it-it seems to be part of the cosmic plan. Also, if you are involved in a legal matter, something may suddenly change in the way the case goes. You get the picture.   This area of travel/study/legal matters/higher education is very prominent for you right now, because Mars, Mercury and Jupiter are all filling your ninth house. But it's nothing compared to what's coming next month in this area, when even more planets are gathering there! ( I love planet orgies!! ) Apparently, one of these subjects is rapidly evolving into a key area of focus for you, so you'll be happy to hear that things will improve and progress quite a bit next month. I love it that so many planets are gathering in fellow earth sign Virgo, for you will feel more "in your element" and things will go your way.   Money is emphasized in your chart this month. This trend actually started on the full moon on the last day of last month, July 31, when you were focused on your salary or a purchase. If you are in the arts, you may have made a sale, but it is equally possible that you had a large bill to pay, no matter what field you're in. If that didn't happen on July 31, this same emphasis is still at play during the first four days of August. ( $2/hour raise, anyone? )  On August 17, Saturn, your ruling planet (and, therefore, very important to note), will have a fabulous meeting with good luck planet Jupiter. This is an exceedingly rare event and will not occur again in a similar way until May 2007. On this day, you will come up with a sensational idea that will require your collaboration with a partner or associate that you trust. Collaborate for either business or romantic reasons-gold-star results await you.   I wish I could say that the rest of the month will be quiet and uneventful, but just the opposite is true.   The first sign that something is up occurs on August 18, when Mars, the warrior planet, opposes Uranus, the planet ruling sudden, unexpected developments. This is a very explosive aspect that is capable of provoking quite a bit of anger from you or the other party involved. These two planets will play out their high-noon shootout in houses that center on attitudes, opinions and doctrine. A conflict of ideals with someone who does not see eye-to- eye with you could cause problems, arising from out of nowhere. You will see this played out in a larger scale in the papers, for there will be world events linked to this aspect, as well. It's an aspect that has a wide berth, covering the whole week before and after it occurs, so don't expect just August 18 to be problematic. ( Go epic cosmic dyke drama!  WOO! )  Then, on August 27, Uranus, planet of unexpected developments, will oppose the Sun. This is a separating aspect, causing people to go in separate directions, also quite suddenly and impulsively. Once again, events seem to come out of the blue. This aspect has a plus or minus of five days, and will therefore overlap with the August 18 aspect mentioned above.   Your third and ninth houses are drawn into this conflict, houses that concern relatives, namely your siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles and in-laws. It probably will not be the best month to talk politics with any of your relatives (even though there's a Presidential election coming up in the USA). Bringing up any kind of controversial topic would be a little like throwing a match on gasoline. Some months it's better to bury your head in a book.   These houses deal with travel, too, and Mercury is retrograde, so it would be wise to schedule a checkup for your car to make sure it is in good working order.   The end of the month is likely to be equally tumultuous. A full moon on August 29, plus or minus four days, is due to fall in your third house, the same area that we have been talking about. As I mentioned, this house rules short-distance travel, communication, contracts and negotiations. This time, the moon walks arm-in-arm with Uranus, bringing on a highly volatile influence.   By the time the full moon occurs on August 29, we will have been through the other two nerve-jangling aspects involving challenges to Uranus by Mars and the Sun, so everyone's likely to be exhausted. If you feel you can't quite cope, join the crowd.   Mercury will always exert its strongest pull on the days it turns retrograde or direct, this time on August 9 and September 2. At the time of the full moon, on August 29, plus or minus four days, Mercury will be getting ready to change gears. That means that Mercury could throw plans into confusion at this time. Try to build in a contingency plan, because the planets are telling us to expect the unexpected.   Romantically, your relationship should proceed more smoothly this month than last. You have Venus, the planet of happiness, in your house of commitment at month's end. When it comes to love, your mood will more likely be thoughtful and serious than flirtatious and carefree. That's fine-love can have a kaleidoscope of moods. You seem to be aware that a relationship has certain privileges and responsibilities for both parties. ( I have no idea what she's talking about. Maybe I should ask Lorraine when she gets here tomorrow. )  If one person is not cognizant of this reality, you will have to talk about how to bring things into better balance. You may have worked on this meditation last month, but then you didn't have help from lucky Jupiter in the way you will now. Jupiter will cooperate with Venus in the best way possible this month.   Your best romantic moment will arrive on Friday, August 13. Don't be superstitious: For you, this Friday the 13th will be great!"   So there you have it.  And you better watch out.
