Let's see, today i went to Ardmore to drop granny off at the drugstore and also to drop off Charlie's belt. Nobody was home at Charlie's, so I accidentally walked into his house that had no one in it. It freaked me out, so I scuttled out of there pretty quick. Then I went to CyberSpace and picked up a sandwich for granny, went and picked up granny, got some gas for her car, and went home.  I watched these wierd movie called I Posed for Playboy. Actually, (and this is going to sound really wierd) posing for playboy looked kinda fun. lol, I mean, I don't wanna get naked and let people take pics or anything, but photoshoots in general look like they'd be fun to participate in. anyways, after that we went to Inky's ball game. Nick was going to go, but he had a dentist's appointment. hahaha! Though, in all seriousness, I dunno if he really wanted to go chill out at a ballfield anyways. Not that I blame him.  I'm trying to diet and exercise now. I'm cutting out all carbs and sugars that I can, only I suppose I'm doing so gradually. Ah well, that's what I get for being so darn fat!!!!  There's not much else to talk about now. As I said, dull day. Well, tootles all. Love, Shannon "Come into these arms again and lay your body down. The rythm of this trembling heart is beating like a drum. It beats for you. It bleeds for you. It knows not how it sounds. For it is the drum of drums, it is the song of songs."--Annie Lennox "Love Song for a Vampire"
