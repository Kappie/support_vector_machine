But anyways...today was a good day. Talked to Josh...and whoever reads this already knows about what, so I wont restate it. I'll just say that I am glad we talked about the stuff that we did. Now I'm just wondering what we decide to do, if anything. I dunno....I guess within time I'll find out soon enough. Well, I don't really have anything much else to say. So I suppose that's it for now. (Happy now Josh???) haha.
