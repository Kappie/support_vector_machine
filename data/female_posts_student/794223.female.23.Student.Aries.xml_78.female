My surgeon found absolutely nothing wrong with me.  No endometriosis, no sigmoid or pelvic adhesions, no scar tissue...nothing.  Nada.  Everything looks completely normal, including my female organs.  This is exactly what I did  not  want to hear, because now the doctors are even more clueless as to what's causing me so much pain.  I feel like screaming.  This pain is not all in my head!  How could "absolutely nothing" be causing all this pain?!  I'll need to seek out another gastrointerologist, another OB-GYN, and quite probably a pain specialist.  My only source of comfort at the moment is Matthew Chapter 8, Verse 17: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases..."  At this point I'm like, "Christ!  Only You can heal me."
