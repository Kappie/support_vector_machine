Martiiiiin, imthe man! lol well n e ways, today was apretty slow day, i went shopping with my mom at theOld Time Pottery store. She loves that place.. lol then i came home and just helped her clean and all thatgood stuff.I think this is the first time i stayed inall summer lol ihave been usually out and about, but tonight it was low key for me.I wanna go see a movie so bad, im thinking I.Robot, or Anchorman, idk i just wanna see something good. I wish there was like a horror flick out, a really good one, i feel like being scared shitless. i REALLY wanna be on fucking scare tactics or something, i just want someone to scare the fuck out of me LoLz me and tony ( moms bf) were talking once and i told him that when i die, i wanna go out like Texas Chainsaw Massacre people, i wanna be scared shitless and then skinned alive! lmao jk on the skinnin alive part but i do wanna be scared soon. Idk its like the feeling u get before u go into a haunted house, its like ur scared and anxious, yah i love that feeling. I also love the feeling of Fall where u know Halloween is coming up. wow i completely started rambling here lol Well lets see what else happened this week, OH OH OH dereks gf came into town and i got to meet her and lemme say this, she is like a spokes model for Progeria lmao she was talking about how she aint easy or whatever and the next day she lost it to Derek, LMAO i was likeyah fucking right ur easier than shit, and whats the kicker to the story would have to be, THATS THE 2ND TIME IN HISTORY THAT THEY HAVE EVER MET!!!!!!!! now u cant sit there and say she aint easy. im so glad im over him, i think he was a rebound, bc now i look back on it all andlaugh, i mean this was the kidthat i basically tore up with thejokes and then all of a sudden i liked him, oh hell no!! LMAO I just need to get my life rolling again and be who i was a long time ago. Recently i havent been me and that bothers the hell out of me, ive been all self conscious and what not and just being a baby. I mean yah i trashed someones car, which would be something i would do, but the real me would have takena shit on her seats , LMAO omg im soo slap happy now. Well Rara is coming back in T minus 76 hours 28 mins and 3 sec... Jk on all of that , but my partner in crime is coming back on Sat, and i got her a gift, a jesus fish for her car, bc it will keep her safe (inside joke). I dont think people realize how much she hates those fuckin things, its like when she sees one she goes anna nicole smith nuts on them. She better like it tho bc i had to go into a friggin Catholic store to get one of those, and if u know me, Catholic people drive me BANANAS! and guess what? im catholic lol i just cant stand the whole, Save us jesus talk they got going on, its like , Do u fucking believe in the Easter bunny too? Thats what the whole God thing is to me. See god sits right next to santa claus and the easter bunny, and they areall waiting for the tooth fairy to show up so they can fuck her in the ass. and OMG i just cant believe i said that lol See ive been programed so that when i say shit like that i feel as if i gotta go pray for my sins now, its so fucked up, the whole thing is fucked up. but not as fucked up as our president, altho i kinda feel sorry for him. Idk i just have pity for someone who tries so hard, and fails at it lol Altho i dont like Kerry either, his droopy eyed self can eat shit too. I want CLINTON BACK! i hate the rule about how many terms u can serve. I still think CLINTON was our Hottest president, and he sits right up there with Kennedy. Ok enough of politics bc this shit is making me mad lol Ok onto another subject i wanna get out, Greg. Now alot of people can laugh in my face and say shit about me bc i honestly dont think ill ever get over him. I dont care how many people leave me notes in this blog saying "HAHAHA" CODY! bc honestly ur opinion doesnt mean n e thing to me when it comes to him, now i do respect ur opinions on other topics tho so keep on ranting about shit that matters. Ok back to greg, i dont think he realizes how much he really does matter to me. i think he always thought that i was like oh i have a bf and shit and thats completely not true, and i feel bad bc if thats how he really felt and that i didnt really show him affection then im sorry. I think thats the first time i actually apologized about the whole thing, i mean yah i said sorry for shit i said but u gotta remember i have been to hell and back with the whole mess lol and whats so strange is still after what all happened i still want him, now i am willing to except the fact that he has a gf and i bet shes great but its kinda like i got the disadvantage to the whole shindig bc she was there when he visited his friends and i wasnt. But hey some people need constant affection from people, and i guess it had to be physical, i mean idk, thats just how i look at it, but im cool with it. I am just simply stating that i still love him and even if he doesnt love me n e more thats ok, i just wanted to get that out there. and hopefully he will always be one of my good friends. Ok thats all i got to say at the moment
