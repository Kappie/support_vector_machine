But Toby is working tonight and after closing he promises fun. *ooooooh*  I'm going home with him tonight. I can't wait. I love sleeping over at his house. It's so fun.  Tmrw is Saturday and I worky worky. Ugh. Annnnd I have to work with that stupid bitch Camille. She is such a fucktard. After work I inted to hang out with my bestest (Michelle). I miss her so much. It's like there is whole in my heart.   Oh well, stupid update is done. Must go eat and shower. Ew. I smell funny.      Jennnnnnnnnifer
