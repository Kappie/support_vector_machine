Almost as painful as stupid people that I know. I don't know if this will make me feel any better but here goes (can't get much worse anyway!)...  I met a certain guy in one of my classes. He was super nice, you know the type. He had a girlfriend already but that was cool cause I wasn't really interested in him like that. Useful for flirting purposes only. For now anyway. So we had lots of fun in class and on MSN. Whatever. And I really start to like this guy. So then his girlfriend breaks up with him for the billionth time. And I am not exaggerating. She does this all the time. And then he immediately starts asking her back. That's his business so I just talk to him about it, try to make him feel a little bit better cause he is pretty upset. Fine. A week or so later I am talking to him and he asks me out. Now I am thinking to myself "Self, this is a bad idea. He just got out of something. So even though you have a crush on him, you really shouldn't. Very very bad idea." But sadly, I like bad ideas. I put it off for a bit but I said okay. Anyway later in the week we meet up and fool around. From bad to worse, self. Bad to worse. So now we are an "item". Lovely. I am actually having a great time. I fall for the guy. And I miss him whenever I can't see him. At this point, my friends are all mad at me for ignoring them and they are all teasing me for making out with the guy in the halls. Because I have become exactly what I used to hate. Enter stage left: self loathing... More fun stuff. But no matter. Because I love this guy and he says he loves me and we are perfect together. At least that is what I keep telling myself. So what if he still talks to the ex a lot. Not important because he loves me now. Right? He meets my mom. Yeah, this clearly shows that I am serious about him because no one guy meets my parents. Except for him now. We are both really nervous but it goes well. And he walks me up to my doctors appointment cause I kinda quit eating. Mostly because it just wasn't important to me anymore. I had better things to do on my lunch hour. And Dinner was never that good to me anyway. Don't even get me started on Breakfast. We get there and he calls me on the fact that I don't like kissing in front of people. He walks home alone in the rain. My parents honk the car horn at him I find out later. And nearly turn purple with embarrassment. Why do I care? I am not responsible for their actions. Anyway, during this whole period of time, the ex keeps emailing him saying that she was going to tell him just the day before we started going out that she wanted him back. The day after the car horn incident, he gets another letter from her. Saying that she just knows that they belong together and she can't live without him and doesn't intend to. She wants to get married and have little babies that are just like him. Well, whatever. He seems totally fine about it. For a bit. Anyway, I see him later on and he says that he doesn't know what to do cause he still loves his ex and she was his first love blah blah blah. Did I mention that she is in grade ten and he is in grade twelve? Ordinarily, this is not a big deal if the grade ten is relatively mature. This is not the case. He says that he is going to have to think about things. Right then and there I should have told him that is he had to think about it, not to bother with me anymore. But I didn't because I really liked the guy. Anyway, long and sad ending short. He thought, we broke up and I was angry. At least for the first ten minutes or so I was angry, then I was sad. Really sad. This guy knew me better than anyone and he still leaves. Nice. "Well, I told you this was a bad idea." I can be very vindictive when I so choose. Anyway many stupid tears later I am fine. I tell him that I think we should still be friends. He thinks that this is a good idea. We should just go back to how things were before we started flirting back and forth. Except therein lies the problem, there was nothing before that. So we settle into a daily routine of not talking to each other. He goes back to making out with her in the halls. I go back to well, not doing that in the halls. Everything is fine.  Awhile down the road, I get mono. Not from him or anyone else (at least that's what I am telling people...) So I miss a lot of school. More than a month. I come back for an afternoon to return books and say hello to people I haven't seen in ages. I see him and tactfully ignore him, as is now customary. When I get to the class that I met him in. One of my friends tells me that him and the girlfriend have broken up again (!). I laugh because it amuses me that I told him this would happen but he chose not to listen. Too idealistic methinks.  Later on that night, I realize that just knowing that he is available has made me start to think about him again. This is not good. Not good at all. But that is where it ends for now because I am trying to avoid talking to him about it. Even though for some reason I now miss him a bit. So that is my sad and incredibly stupid story.   My bruise is getting more and more sore. Whoa that rhymes. Anyway, I have other things to do... All right, I lie but I would like to. Next time I will have happy or funny stories to offset this gigantic downer! Until then...
