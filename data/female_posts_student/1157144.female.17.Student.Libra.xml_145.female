I don't have morning practice tomorrow, but I'd still like to pick up the tape.  I'm scared to swim against Independence now... their coach is way too good.  One of the guys (coach, not kid) is an 18 time all American with several world records.  He teaches so well it's like I was playing violin and traveling half way across the world to study under a master.  I'm seriously thinking about taking a month of school swimming and "studying swimming" under him on his team.  At the Biology thing tonight I encountered the stupidest woman ever.  Through a thick Russian r-rolling accent and a beer-belly chin, I could barely make out her stupid questions like, "So to get college credit what do you have to do?", which she asked 3 times sucessively despite the answer being written down in the brochure she waved in her hand as she talked and the three crystal clear explanations by the host speaker.  Ugh.  I shiver in pain, disgust, and boredom to think of her child(ren).  Anyone up for a quick dinner tomorrow?  Fast food or cheap eat place like El Pollo Loco, Baha Fresh, etc...
