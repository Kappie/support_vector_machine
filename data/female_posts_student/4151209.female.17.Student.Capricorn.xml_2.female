My life is quite uneventful, but perhaps this journal will improve my already fantastic writing skills. - Gosh, I sound cocky!!! (I'm really not, I don't think I am good at anything, but the one thing I am confident in is my writing ability.)  Anyways, here's to my boring, nonchalant life. Peace Out, Brit
