I'm finally home and settled in again. actually i got home last nite but jess came over pretty much as soon as i got home, sooo...i didn't really get to get on here (besides the fact that my computer was EXTREMELY gay)...but today we started band camp again :D ! i love band...it's so much fun, although some of the people REALLY bother me. o well. it was good seeing everyone again tho. i really missed everyone sooo much. other than that, not too much is goin on here. like i said just kinda settling in. it kinda makes me mad that since i've had this, not a whole hell of a lot has gone on for me to "vent" about. it's good, i mean, don't get me wrong...but still...o well, i guess this is a journal too! well, i guess that's it...if n e thing occurs...haha..riight. nvm
