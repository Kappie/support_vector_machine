BUT ANYWAYS! My guitar is here!! yay! i was so excited, i was half way jumping up and down (not all the way cuz of my knee) and i did the happy clap and giggle and im sure my dad thought i was nuts. anyways, i sat down and played and played well, i wouldnt excatly call it playing, i TRIED to put down some chords and i watched some of my dvd on how to play and looked at this awesome website i found that shows u step by step and has pictures and example sound clips. yay!! I named my guitar Jonas.   I went shopping today, and of all days, today was a bad day for shopping. I want to wear my cute black and pink outfit to church sunday, which i really got for a wedding, but its ok, cuz no one will see me at church and the wedding! lol but nooo..my dad wanted me to "save" that outfit. DAMMIT. its a cute outfit..its a black shirt, kinda punkish, the way its cut and all, and it has little pink dots on it. lol its soo cute and i wear a black shirt and a matchin pink cardigan. its VERY cute when its all put together. But NOOOO cant wear it until july 10th. dammit. anways, this new outfit i got to go with some kahki capris, but its this V-neck lite blue shirt, makes my boobs look fuckin HUGE..or maybe they're already like that..but the shirt brings it out. haha idk but i def. bought the shirt for my boobs. and a pink little pull over summery shirt thing..idk how to explain it. whats up with me and pink cardigan type things? idk. lol im gonna go pick out some shoes for it later in the week though. Then i went to PetLand, which is like a Petsmart. I think their "specialty" is puppies!! they're sooo cute. and of course, i want to play with ALL of them, but dad is like "noo u dont need to play with the puppies" lol shit. i wanna play with the fuckin puppies! i want a little dog sooo bad. lol like one u can put in a purse. :D They were sooo cute. We then went to Diary Queen and i got a small cherry sundae. yum. it was good.   *much love and noodles*
