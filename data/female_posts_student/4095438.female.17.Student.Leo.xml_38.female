Today when I was downloading pics from the digital camera on to the computer, I discovered a little photo journey that my little sister had obviously gone on! I'll set up a way for you to view it later because it is SO funny :) She's taken photos of her dolls in all diff positions and she's rearranged things in my room etc.. she's such a mischievous lil monkey.  We got photos back today from way back in January when we were skiing in Idaho  Stevens Pass and there are some great ones - these 2 are among my faves! Just so you know, me and my brother were fighting (and giggling!) over the prime position on the couch so Mum decided to snap some shots when we were off guard (low blow!). They're scans so not the best quality but cute nonetheless! If you look closely, you'll see my hair all braided, fresh from the International Marketplace in Hawaii :D           Ok, off to sleep. Tomorrow's going to be a good day - half of our eBay auctions are ending so we get to live the excitement of snipers and last-second bids on our sales :D I'm also catching reruns of  One Tree Hill  on the WB; episodes I've never seen before! Wheeeeeeeee. Sundays rock. Oh, and HAPPY AUGUST ! The bestest month of the year. I'll leave you with a shot of India eating some snow.. teehee.
