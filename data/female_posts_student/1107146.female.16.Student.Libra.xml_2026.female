I figure one o' those will get me an all access pass into the Fat Man's house, whereafter I can have a field day.  The rhinocerous was the desire to have an unusual and large animal. Frankly, I'm more surprised that no one mentioned the fact that I wanted an astronaut. As in, I wanted to keep a human being in an astronaut suit in my room. Eh, I would have thought it was cool when I was a kid, I was maldeveloped.  If only that was all.  Goodbye to all, I'm going to fraggin' AZ. And goodbye to Abby and Linds, have fun in...well, wherever Breakthru is, man! Woo!
