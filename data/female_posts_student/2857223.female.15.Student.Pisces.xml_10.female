It was really good, way better than the first one I thought - although it had more stuff, like jokes/humor for adults, so a lot of the people in the theater w/ their kids didn't like it. The best parts were the ones w/ Pinnochio and the little ginger bread guy - those two crack me up. Puss in Boots was so cute too!!...and sorry to spoil the ending, but Fiona and Shrek should have just stayed "normal", because Shrek was a babe...haha, If I find a pic I'll post it, but I can't find one yet...Anyway, I definitely recommend it, it's a great movie :P GO SEE IT!
