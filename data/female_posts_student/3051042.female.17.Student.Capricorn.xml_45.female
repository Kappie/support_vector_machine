MtDewGirl87: yeah MtDewGirl87: that's what I said junknerd: attack like what? MtDewGirl87: I was dancing and taking pictures, smoking a cigarette when I felt the need to sit down. So I asked Michelle if she wanted to sit, she said she was okay with standing but if I wanted to I could go. MtDewGirl87: So I nodded and walked to two open chairs MtDewGirl87: I sat down for not even a minute when I told her I had to go to the rest room MtDewGirl87: she said she wanted to come along too MtDewGirl87: so I walked in and two of the stalls were free of doors, and the others were occupied MtDewGirl87: so when the next stall opened up (the handicapped one) I went in then blacked out MtDewGirl87: I woke up apparently a few minutes later, and broke out in a cold sweat MtDewGirl87: she thinks it was an anxiety attack junknerd: sounds possible to me junknerd: hope you're ok MtDewGirl87: I'm fine now MtDewGirl87: but it was weird MtDewGirl87: how was your night?  LMAO. Besides the random attack, the concert was beyond my expectations.
