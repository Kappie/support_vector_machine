Because there is this awesome guy who lives in Chicago who is always trying to out-do my presents to him with presents from him. It sounds like a perpetual gift war- right? Maybe. However it came about that I have a cool guy friend in Chicago sending me presents... I may never know. I just know that he's made my day awesome beyond words.   Maybe I should explain...  I'm not used to guys returning gifts for gifts. I usually just give them gifts, they say thanks, forget my birthday, and never send me anything. Case in point: Kevin So-and-So.  Me and Kevin So-and-So meet online and hit it off well enough. Before I knew it... my mom was calling his mom and we were long-distance buddies. I sent him a ton of crap, mostly because he was always depressed about something and needed cheering up, or just for the sheer joy of sending someone something by way of the U.S Postal Service. He sent cards and letters and stuff, but most of it inconsequential. I was constantly arguing with him about not treating me like his little sister (I was 14, he was 16), and he was content to do the opposite. One day, I noticed he wasn't talking all to much, so I asked him if he was talking to a ton of other people. He said; "Nah, just talking to this girl from (insert state here)". So I jokingly replied "O so now she is more interesting to talk to than me?". He hit me with a statement I will never forget... "She's the mashed potatoes and your just the gravy." Yea, sure he meant that as a joke. But seriously- would you tell a friend that someone you had just met is more important than you are?! I decided that since I was obviously a nuisance to him just to cut it off. We haven't spoke to each other in over a year. And now, he's engaged. (he turns 19 in September... I think..)  So, I'm not really used to this "You give me a gift, I give you a gift." I usually just give without any thought of getting anything back. That's just how I am. Maybe you can see why I had to write this post then.    Arturo and I met at camp  In the summer of 02'. I was taking Honors Ecology and he was taking Persuasion and Debate Honors. Now, I'm not really sure how the whole thing got started, but I do remember that the first time I saw him was at the CTD showing of  Monty Python and the Holy Grail  . He was sitting behind me and Maria (Maria, Marie???), and when the movie was over we all started playing cards. Playing cards was like, the only thing anyone did at CTD lol. After the movie, we all went to dinner together. Me and Maria sprung for a table in the back.. and the only thing I remember clearly is Arturo taking a dive into the chairs. He was, eh, running maybe? I'm not sure but I do remember him getting up and saying that he was all right whilst me, Sarah, and Maria laughed until we couldn't breathe. Yea... good times. So we all hung out on various occations. It was fun cause, I annoyed the heck out of Arturo and he annoyed the heck out of me. It was like, a mutual annoyance, but I still loved (I say that in the "friendly" manner) him anyways. Before I knew it, camp was over, and I went back to (insert state here). You know how everyone promises to KIT? Well... it never actually happens.    That next summer  I went back to CTD so I could flaunt my "older than all ya'll" stance. I hadn't heard from Arturo, let alone seen him since the last day of camp from the previous summer. I seen him... maybe like... the third day, while walking to an activity. Now, he had obviously seen me too, so he said hey or hi or whatever people say when seeing someone that they hadn't seen in awhile. I'm not quite clear on what I did next, I think I may have kept on walking or turned around and said "Yeah??". Anyways, when I did finally stop to talk to him, he told me that he had lost my email addy (as he is good at losing a lot of things in various places) and thus, couldn't reach me. So, I was like, ok well that's understandable. We started hanging out again, although, not as much. Why?  1. Because I had an enormous amount of work (no joke) 2. Because he was still a commuter, which does make it a bit difficult. 3. And Because we did different activities.  We still found the time to hang out though... He kept me sane. I was in a group with a buncha 7th graders and 8th graders who were, well, as me and ritu called it "Giglish". There were people in my group who I loved bunches (Ellen, the coolest 7th grader I have ever met, and Ritu- my companion dork.). But most of them just drived me insane. So it was cool to have someone to talk to that was neither A. Giglish, or B. under the age of 13.    We always found time to be ticked off at each other.  Funny as that may sound. The first summer, he was mad at me for hooking him up with Maria for the last dance and "ruining his/her life". I think we worked it out at the end of the dance or something, but, yeah, all I know is that I left the dance early cause I felt like crap and just wanted to go home.   The second summer, I was mad at him. He had come to socialize in the dorms on the last Friday of camp and left all his stuff in there. He talked to me for awhile, then headed to this one girls (the girl he was crushing on that summer) and had left all his stuff in my room. Well, me and my friends decided to head to dinner early and we completely missed each other so he could grab his stuff. So his sister came to me after dinner and asked for me to get his stuff cuz he had his music for the talent show in one of his bags. I brought all his stuff down only to carry two-thirds of it back upstairs. So.. she had what he need now... or so I thought. On my way to the talent show he came running over and said "My sister got the wrong bag!" I was like... o great that's just wonderful. So I had to give him my room key and everything so he could get his stuff. It was just one big mess and I was cranky to begin with so that was pretty much that. I stayed mad at him the whole night and well.. we pretty much avoided each other at the last dance. He imed me a couple days after I had gotten home and stuff so we talked and yadda yadda. I didn't stay mad, the whole situation was just to stupid to stay mad, lol.   We don't talk all that often anymore, but I did remember his birthday. I sent him a necklace I had bought at my hometown's ocktoberfest and a card and stuff. I was plotting something though. After he got the first birthday present I sent him this awesome basket of b-day goodies. I guess it must have made an impression. Lol. For Christmas he sent me an angel statue, then I, feeling bad for not sending a Christmas present, sent him a 20$ gift card to Hot Topic.   My birthday came up and he said "No money". So I said- just send and ecard or something. I mean, that's usually what everyone does anyways. So, on my birthday, he sent an ecard. Lol. He was one of the 5 people who actually remembered my birthday to begin with so he was automatically on my good side for that day.   And then this gift came...  30 days after my birthday. I wasn't really expecting it.. other than the fact that arturo had asked for my address a couple of days ago (he lost it.. lol). So that was a little clue. But yeah- it came today in the mail. It's this really awesome painting of well... I'm not sure. But I love it- it has all these hidden faces and things. Plus- it comes from Mexico! How awesome is that? Yea, it's pretty awesome.   ARTURO- THANK YOU, YOUR AWESOME, AND I LOVE YA!  Just wait until your birthday... I'm gonna get you good! Lol.    I leave you with this..... I'm feeling like a million bucks today
