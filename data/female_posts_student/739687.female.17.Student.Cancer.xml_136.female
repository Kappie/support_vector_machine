Had a doctor appointment, because for the past 3 or 4 days I've been getting sharp pains in my stomach...and it's so incredibly horrible and painful. So then I had to go down to Ft Worth for a blood test, because they  think (and I stress the word think, because you never know with crazy doctors these days) that it's either a gallbladder infection, a liver infection or appendicitis. Fun. So depending on what the results are, I don't know if I'm going to San Antonio this weekend or not.*Pains currently jabbing me...ouch*  Anyways...not much else going on. Last night was Halloween...it wasn't too bad. Well, I'm out children. Buh bye.
