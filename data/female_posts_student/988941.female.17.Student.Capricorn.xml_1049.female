It was the 10mb Hub. So, I need to get a new 10/100mb Hub. Seen one on eBay for a tenner. Yay! 10x network speeds for £10!!! Not that anybody cares.  Anyway, I think its time to start the Official Christmas List Blogs. Here's mine:  16x DVD Drive for PC  The Office - Season 2 DVD  Command And Conquer - Zero Hour: Expansion Pack  The Osbournes - Series 1 DVD  Thats about it for now!
