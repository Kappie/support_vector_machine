Maybe not.   The photographer's here. It tends to make one self-conscious--in my mind, I'm the only one who can stare at my own face for the sake of staring at it. Not today. Just little fragments that define people: the Durango in the driveway, a penchant for forgetting names, unctuousness. A body reminiscent of R's.  And a new body in the house makes me realize what kind of person I am, too. What's your favorite author? Composer? What're your hobbies? I can't answer one of them. Maybe it's because Fitzgerald doesn't immediately come off my tongue or I don't care to share that I love any romantic composer that just makes me melt or that I have a nasty habit of writing and writing and writing. I just don't think that this middling man in polos and khakis really needs to know. So I wonder, how do I begin to trust adults? Maybe it's when they're in the same situation as I am, not some sort of master/subordinate kind of thing. Maybe I only start to trust when I approve of what they do. Photography is not something I adore.  I don't like my mom around adults, either. I am very, very glad I do not have her personality, but my dad's. Mother dear is fidgety as hell and very very conscious of her appearance. Oh, I'm a hard one to satisfy. Eyeshadow. An old dress. "Is this all right?" Maybe it's silly, but I've always been afraid for Mom when she's around hired older men. First of all, the man is under her control, since she's paying for him. But he's trying to sell something too. This isn't the first time--the electrician raised an eyebrow of mine, too. My mother is too easy to please. With this knowledge, I don't want to know what she was like when she was dating Dad, who is a quiet, laid-back soul.   Drove on the freeway to Fry's today. Almost crashed the car coming out of the parking lot: tried to turn left across a wide road, and it took forever to wait for traffic both ways to subside. Eventually, the car behind honked and I acted on instinct and charged across. There was a gold sedan coming straight at me and my dad made a noise, but somehow, I felt so calm. I knew she wasn't going to crash. I don't know how that happens.  Get me out of these shoes and dress.
