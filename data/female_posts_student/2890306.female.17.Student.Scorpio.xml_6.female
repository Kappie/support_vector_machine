So, school was, as my friend would say, schoolish.  Today for lunch, we had chicken strips.  A question (one of many) that has always plagued my mind is, why does the human populous insist on naming meat products with parts that are not even a part of that particular meat.  Allow me to explain.  Do chickens have nuggets or strips?  I have never seen a buffalo with wings, have you?  And what sort of meat has balls, honestly?!  Wait.  Don't answer that one.  I should submit that the next odd animal product in line be fish knees.  Yes.  Now THAT would go over in the school lunch line.  There must be  some  odd collection of leftover meat lying around, just waiting to be made into "fish."  Just you wait.  Today, at play, things are progressing.  We are coming together as a cast more and more as the days pass, and that makes me happy.  I enjoy being there.  On a more sour note, at the beginning of play practice today, Jeff Robbins (who plays the bishop) hit his head on the frame of the very short doorway to the terrace of the play set, passed out, and started shaking!  I had just talked to the guy about 5 minutes earlier, so it was hard to believe.  Fortunately, he got back on his feet and went home after his mom was called.  I am just glad he's okay.  Now, chilluns, I leave you with a chucklable Calvin and Hobbes.  Oh, and if you'd like to leave me a little hello, click on my comment link just down there.  I always love a note or two...  See you tomorrow!
