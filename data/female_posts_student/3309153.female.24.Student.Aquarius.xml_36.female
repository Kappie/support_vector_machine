Iseriously believe thatwere my father to walk into a roomwhere I was sitting...just sitting there...something about the way in which I was doing it would make him uneasy.   He would ask, "What are you doing?"    Nothing.    "Why are you sitting here alone?"    Because I want to.    And then laced withtension, "Watch your mouth, young lady."    What?    Most people can still surprise me, but not daddy. Father, I can script. Literally as well. His is the only signature I can copy as though it is my own. He is easy, in that way. Whatever I do, it is threatening to him. I know that. I have accepted it. It is, in fact, how I tell if I am living rightly. If he does not like it, I must continue. If he does not understand, I am on course. If I move,and he becomes angry, the air I breathe is sweeter. I was not surprised when one of the books my father gave me for Christmas, a few years ago, was called  Hell's Best Kept Secret . All I was wasreassured. That he still thought I was godless, yes, that too. But mostly reassured that he has never forgiven me for loving himonly as well as I love my mother. He will die thinking the truth is that he deserves more.   But I thought it was just him. Turns out, it is actually me. Though I have no idea why. I have yet tocomprehend how it is I do what I do to make men miss a beat. Perhaps it is the way I am happy, sometimes, and they have nothing to do with it. Maybe it isthat I do notcrumble when they leave the room.Possibly it could be that I sing songs loudly and dance with abandon three feet in front of them, and when I am done, walk away never having madean attempt at eye contact.   Yesterday, my friend (not my boyfriend, though this wonderful friendis a man who might just as easily have been speaking on his behalf--I tell you I think all men are on the same side against little old  me ) told me that I don't believe in love. I asked him why he would say such a thing. He told me that I've written it in every letter I've written him in the past six months, in some way. Again- what?  Because I have done no such thing. I don't know anybody--ANYBODY--who believes in love as I who only continues to breathe some days because her heart can't let go of the fantasy of a man who will love her...all of her, as well...just so, just right...only for forever. But that kind of love is a fantasy. I live in the world and have never seen anything like it. Therefore, I have no proof that what I want even exists. Though I absolutely believe in it. And even as I type this, I am asking myself... is he right?       Wait! No! Of course he is absolutely wrong! I am right! People believe in all kinds of things they have not seen. People do believe in things when there is no proof of their existence. I believe in China. I believe in Brazil. I believe in Derek Walcott and Kate Chopin. I believe in these things, though I have never seen them. I am right. I do believe in love. And someday, before I die, I believe that a man will show me that fantasies can find flesh. And he will walk the walk of love. And he will talk the talk of love. And he will breathe the breath of love into me and I shall know. There will be my proof. And then I will tell everyone who will listen of this thing I have, this keeper of my heart.   But not today. I will not walk around pretending that I see human beings loving one another when all I see are people pantomiming what they have been told to pantomime,pecking the kisses they have seentheir parents peck. No, thank you. I know that there are others and I will have them. I know that a man can kiss the sole of my foot in broad waking day and not be ashamed. And I could want him, do, yet stillunderstand that he is not enough. Not nearly enough for the risk I might someday take. I believe in more, though I am content to sit in this quiet room for a while. I will see what will blossom.   My boyfriend, too, lives with the fear of my father. He is home, now, afraid to talk to me. Afraid to see me. He thinks I am trying to leave him. I listened to something he said, thanked him for telling me. And that is all. My quiet, I guess, was something he has never seen.   But I can be quiet. Sometimes, I really have nothing to say. Why men believe my quiet means I amplotting their downfall, Ido not understand. Why men always think I mean something else (i.e., "I don't believe in love" when I actually wrote "I believe in falling in love and all that that means but who knows how long that lasts") beats me.   And other women say, "Well, yes, dear. That is how they think."   "Oh, that is what men do, sweetie."   "Yeah, they don't make much sense."   "Dont try to understand, just ride hissilliness out."   And these things are from women they think are not their enemies, as they imagine I am. When really, I know men can be better. I refuse to accept that they are an other kind of human being than I am--really. There are, of course, things that separate them from me, but the real things--like how to love and how to talk and how to listen and how to take care...there must be some of the stuff thatis in mealso in a man.  Somewhere. Somehow.    I believe.   I believe that one day a man will look at me and not see a dagger pressed to his throat when I actually have a lily for him to smell...which could also be a nice name for one of our daughters.
