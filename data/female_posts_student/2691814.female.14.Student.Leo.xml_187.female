I felt like i could run a mile or something. But ya, it was a good class this time, a longer combination but this cheerleader girl (by her shorts) kept wanting to change the ending after everything was done. so ya, i was like....gosh darn it, just change the whole frikkin thing already. And plus it was her first class and she like made the mistake of wanting to change it. arg lol but oh well its just a stupid dance so screw it. It was fun anyway but ya i was just shaking i mean we did a lot of crunches and push-ups which are fine with me cuz i like doing them but, i dont know....i've noticed that i've gotten way stronger.     So anyway, I just keep thinking of that time where me and francesca went to the pool at night and jumped in NAKED!! no j/k lol but it was alot of fun 'someones coming'..'shh swim under' lol oh god that was funny.  oh ya, deidras going to new jersey....she said she wanted a change of scenery...ha, careful what you wish for miss Flacco.  I just wanna go to sleep and die for a few hours. Its too boring here.......im going crazzzzyyyyyyyy...xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxlalallalalalalal ....hehe. love u franny! yat yat yatttt
