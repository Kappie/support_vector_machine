And we seem to always have an obsession with our *firsts*, especially of the epic variety.    The sexy maroon number with the grey stripe on one end is certainly of that variety.  Leave it to me to travel many thousands of miles to buy my first item of truly British clothing at the Gap.  Not just any Gap, mind you, the one in the commercial heart of our dear old Great Grandmother.  No quaint old store on hidden backstreets shopping for us!  We couldn't even get away from huge commercial coffee shops for god's sake!  Regardless of its heritage (and maybe a bit because of it!), the scarf became an integral part of the rest of the London voyage and has remained such ever since.  I don't put it way during the warmer months.  It stays faithfully at the ready, even though it never gets used once the windows start staying open (which they are).    So yea, today marks the end of the little guy's reign for this year.  To be sure, he'll come with me for Spring Break because winter's still fighting like hell everywhere else in the state, but his duties are winding down.  I miss him when he's not around.  But driving to school with the window rolled down and squinting though the sun glasses work well to remind me exactly why he was left to his own devices.    Anyway...  Have a pretty light day today.  So, of course, I'm going to fill it up with important duties.  Well, just one, really.  Going to write the first issue of the Appellate Brief this afternoon, after the big Candidate's Forum.  GO SUE AND ALYCIA!  Will have a nice, solid 5 hours to crank that sucker out, making it the most beautiful rough draft of an argument I've ever seen!  It really shouldn't take that long to write it out, but I'm determined to use the time allotted to the fullest, so if I can make a editorial pass or two, that's just fine by me.  Getting the Motion to Suppress assignment back yesterday provided the perfect motivation, too.  We love rolls, and seeing just how far we can push them.    Friday's rapidly approaching and the Mixes are anxious to hit the highway.
