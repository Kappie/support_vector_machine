Sure enough, I saw Vincent. The guy who sometimes drives me nuts was there to make me feel better. I came up to him and said hey hows the game going? He was like oh it good man in his usual hows it going voice. We talked a bit and just as I left he said "Good Job With The Sales Man!". Oh man, I was sooooo happy, just that small boost helped me carry on through the pointless night. It's amazing what a little bit of  a boost can do.
