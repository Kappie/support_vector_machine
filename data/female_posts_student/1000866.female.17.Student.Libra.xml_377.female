Bryan asked me to homecoming and in a really creative way too! He put this giant cookie in a pizza box, and the cookie said, "Catie...homecoming + Bryan? And he gave me whipped cream, but we wont go in to that inside joke. So, we just ate the cookie during band. It was quite tasty.   So, that was a really really nice start to my day. I do have a cold which stnks, and I had to go to marching and the game tonight which also kind of stunk. I guess it was alright, but...eh. I guess I should go sleep for tomorrow. Argh. I don't want to go with a passion...  YaY!!! Haha, I'm just so excited I get to go to homecoming though. It's going to be so much fun. I can't wait.
