I came upon this realization while the little paper sleeves on the hashbrowns at McDonald's. It was quite an epiphany now that I think about it. How bizarre...doo doo do...doo doo do..doo doo do..oh baby...how bizarre. And now for totally random pop theme songs from the late 1990's.   And what's up with Victoria Secret's not having any spunky-fun underwear patterns in my size in the clearance catalog. Now tell me, can all of the low-rise bikini panties really be sold out? What a fraud! What a chirade! What about ending my post with three exclamative statements! What's up with that?!  Da Da DAAAAAAA...
