You know what the right and wrong things to say are...you know that you know!  Hmph.  Trying to decide whether it's a good idea to go out tonight and drink my cares away or stay at home and wallow in my sorrow.  Hmm, choices, choices.  I'm dreading going home for Thanksgiving.  Call me bitchy, but I don't want to deal with it.  I am fine being there when I'm there but it's hard to get me to go and hang out with people and shit.  I dunno, whatever, whatever.  I am so random right now b/c I had a disturbing incident with a girlfriend mention that I'm just not interested in right now.  Ugh.  So...what should I talk about?  I have nothing good to say.  I have pretty much ruled out the option of work for tonight.  I will be doing enough of that over break.  I think I may fly home on Thanksgiving Day and leave on Saturday morning.  Who the fuck cares anymore?  I am very upset, actually.  I shouldn't lie.  I don't know what I expected but I didn't expect to be intentionally upset.  He knows that he can't say those things to me!  He knows that I don't want to make her a reality in my world!  I have told him that.  That was so advertant and I don't understand why.  Man, I really DO think too much.  Why?  Why am I cursed with a brain that thinks so much?
