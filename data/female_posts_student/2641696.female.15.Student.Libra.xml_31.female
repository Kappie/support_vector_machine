My sister's been shopping every day since the year 1000 (in other words, since we got out) and here I am, sitting at home, being a loser. And, true to my loser-esque ways... an awesomely cool artist/writer (go check out her friends' work too, omgomgomg! I've already got 3 new wallpapers lol)    urlLink www.meadowhaven.net    Now, since I'm bored and really have nothing further to say that I'd like to post on my blog... I'm off to watch Mickey Blue Eyes. hehe. Hugh Grant may be cheesy and a bad actor, but guys with British accents are always funny, no matter what they say.
