I had to play for Mason today in band, which was somewhat frightening for me because I've never actually played for him before... so of course I wanted to make a good impression.  He gave me some compliments, so that made me feel good- although I didn't play anywhere near my best.  Then, I had a lesson and was like 20 minutes late for Spanish.. but all the juniors were out testing, so we just had a free day anyways.  World history was good-- we're watching "All Quiet on the Western Front" and I really like that movie.  Mrs. Ford was gone today, so we had a sub in chemistry!!  Just had busy work to do, and as usual, I ended up doing it all, and everybody else just copied off me, but I didn't really care since I had nothing better to do.  Then here I am in 5th period, doing the usual -- NOTHING!  Sooooo, no homework for me (aside from a couple world history questions).    Yesterday was so terribly boring.  Charles was with Kevin at Speedzone, and Habibi/Rebecca/Mooney were out job hunting, so me and Collin were left with nothing to do... sooo we just sat around all day until Charles came back.  Then, we all hung out at Collin's until like 8:30- I helped Charles with his physics lab while he tried to help me not lose Mario Party... but sadly, I still sucked.  Yep.. that was my uneventful day.  Birthday countdown - 68 days!  Cool song alert!! Radiohead - "Karma Police"  Anybody up for hearts tonight??? ; )  That's all for now!!
