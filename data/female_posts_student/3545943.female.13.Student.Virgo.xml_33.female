Unfortunately, I'm going to start off this whole dang thing with some random stuff from my old profile which is now dead.  Not really.  But whatever.  Actually, I don't think I will.  So scratch that.  I think I'm going to end each bloggy entry with a list of random things.  Current things.  Things to help you keep up with my life.  Ha.  Current: Knitting project--practicing various cables in light blue scrap yarn on size seven single point needles. Favorite color--grey.  Actually, it's more of a political statement than a color. Reading material--Summerland, by Michael Chabon Metaphor for life right now--Lost, but content
