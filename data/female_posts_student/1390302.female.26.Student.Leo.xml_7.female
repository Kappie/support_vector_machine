Memory is history recorded in our brain, memory is a painter, it paints pictures of the past and of the day.”  ~ Grandma Moses   I was thinking about my little sister this evening and I got to remembering when I was her age.  14 years old is such a carefree age!  Aside from the burden of getting the much needed education –which comes in handy when we get older- life was bubbles and cotton candy compared to what it means to be a “grown-up!”  When I was 14 years old I always thought it would be nice to be an adult, not to have parents to tell you what to do, when to go to bed, etc.  Now I realize that parents are the loving shelters that protect us from that nasty reality called age.  Parents are what keep us sane –and for God’s sake, safe- long enough to become a big bad 18 and older.    I gave my parents such a hard time growing up!  I wish I could take back all the agony I caused them daily.  I was a sassy, smartass bitch to my mother –now I realize that I wasn’t the hot shit I thought I was.  I didn’t know everything –or perhaps I did and I just forgot it all as I got older :).   I know that if I could go back, if I could be 14 again I would.  When you’re 14 years old your ignorant to life’s uglier side.  When your 14 years old you don’t know that you may grow-up, marry an asshole, and end up part of the nations largest statistic, Divorce –at least I know I didn’t.  When you’re 14 years old you don’t understand bills or hunger, or what you parents go through trying to make ends meet and even though every 14 year old may think that they suffered “depression” few actually know what that word means until they grow-up.    The worst mistake I ever made was to take my family for granted.  When I was a little girl, a teenager, my family was a good family.  Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my parents and Candace –and even Staci sometimes :) - but I was a rotten little brat.  Now I know some who have had the worst families imaginable, fathers who abandon them and leave them to fend for themselves in a children’s home.  Now I know people with alcoholic parents and parents who would neglect them for another joint, how lucky I was to have a hardworking mother and father who loved me and would never abandon me.  Stupid little girls my sister and I were, and I see now.  But my little sister, Candace is not.  Candace is a good girl –at least most of the time.  She does her work and is always there for my mom.  She’s a smart kid, a truly smart kid.  Oh, to be 14 again!  ~Kristyn
