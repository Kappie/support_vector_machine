I don't know what's going on, but I really want to help them all. Except I can't. I'm only one person. One individual. I was thinking about Vivian because she seemed really depressed today. I tried to comfort her, but I knew Mark would do a better job than me. To me, I'm clueless at times. And that was one time where I was.   I guess everyone has that phase going through them. Lots of people think I do too, but in my opinion I really don't think I do. Whenever I look upset, it's not because of something that hurt me, however something that affected me. All the times when I see sad faces, I feel upset. I don't know why but I just do. I guess it's who I am.  So many people sympathized me today. I really don't know how I feel. If I'm sad, happy, angry, relaxed. I think I just didn't get the time to organize how I felt about everything. I walked home today, as usual and walked to the pond that's next to my house. I went to the same place, the same spot, the same position, and just relaxed. I wanted to feel the wind, and the air that was around me. For a while, it was as if I was in a place where there wasn't any sadness, but a place where you can truly be happy. Even though that's one place to be truly happy, I still think that my life is happy. Everything around me is going to come to an end, like our lives. You know that one day you're going to go above the clouds and onto heaven. When I reach that special place, I'm going to find eternal happiness.   I think I should make my post related to the title. You know what I think now? I really think this was right. Even though at first I wasn't thinking straight, I know that God created things to be this way. Like all my other posts, life is meant to be planned but not by us. I was thinking about all the times where Safee was upset, and he said it wasn't because of me, but it was. And I accept that. I didn't make him happy. But I know when he loves someone else, he going to make her happy, and she's going to give all that he wanted. =). I'm just glad that for once I'm going to see a smile on his face. For once I won't have to worry, but I still will as a friend. I want him to be happy..  I guess that's all I want to say today. I just had to get that out of me. Because life is like a circle. It's never ending. Once it begins, it just keeps on going on.
