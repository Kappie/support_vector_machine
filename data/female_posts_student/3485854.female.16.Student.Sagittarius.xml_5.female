Tomorrow, I'm going to Holiday World. It's a trip for the managers at work. I hope to have fun. Mom and Brian are already talking about him moving in. She just met him for the first time on the 3rd, which is is exactly a week ago. Is that not some shit? Well, he better find some source of income, because I am not supporting another person, I'm struggling to provide for the 5 of us. I can't afford a sixth person.  Throughout my life I have come to feel this: 1.) I will depend on a man to support me 2.) I will never let the man I am with to sit while I support him, he will be expected to have some type of income 3.) I will never depend on my children to support me. If I can't provide for them I will not have them. Any disagreements?  Well, all, I'm going to go play pool. Later!  Joke of the day: Anyone coming?  The Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding on the range one day.   The two came to a stop, where Tonto jumped off his horse and put his head on the ground to listen to see if anyone was coming.   After a few seconds he rose and said, "Buffalo come."  The Lone Ranger was amazed and proclaimed "Damn you Indians are smart, how the hell did you know there were buffaloes coming?"  Tonto replied, "Face sticky."
