I miss Warped Tour.  I'm taking the guys up..too bad I don't think I'm taking god up. That would rock rock rock. If god graces me with his presence tonight, I'll be a happy girl. I'll also be a happy girl if I meet some new boys. That's right. Another song you kids need is "Long Goodnight," by the get up kids, and "I belive in a thing called love," by the darkness. Those are pretty nifty selections. I actually wanted to catch some sleep before we hit the road, but I don't know if I'll be able too. Ugh. This will be interesting. Esecially because I have a high hate-tred, for ska. Yes, I know. That makes no sense, and why am I going right? Well, put it too you this way, it's a show, and It's in Cleveland, only $10 and I'm going with the guys. I've never been to a show with them. This will be fun! .. I think .. If I don't die in the pit first.  I'm going to go, if anyone wants to come along tonight, your more than welcome. Just bring some powerade and all will be fine.
