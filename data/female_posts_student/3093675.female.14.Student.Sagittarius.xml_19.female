Well, now I’m working alone on Nigeria. The crisis is the Question of Palestine, which Nigeria doesn’t really have an opinion on. I decided to go with Palestine, because3 50% of Nigeria is Muslim, and they have some similarities- i.e., both were taken over by the British and removed from parts of their homeland. But I’m never, ever doing anything like this again, it’s wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-ay too stressful. Did i mention that the conference is going to be one day this week, and they don't tell us what day exactly? arrrgh!
