LoL Well here it goes...  Wednesday: Got up early and packed the rest of my stuff...worked in my room for awhile...Mostly just sat there listening to music cuz I was way to lazy to do anything. About 3:45 Terry came and picked me up. He talked with my mom alot bout figuring out our tickets to Clay Aiken n stuff. Cant wait! It'll be tons  of fun with Sandy and Tracy. So then he took be back to Sanborn. Had an interesting chat with him. He told me bout a guy named Chuck that Tracy works with who blew out his brain while scubadivin once and now hes kinda weird n stuff. Like all he says is "Oookeeey." and "Oookeeey guys." "I got this one guys." Yeah. So out whole thing this weekend was "Oookeeey!" Yeah. Then I sat there for awhile and Tracy and Sandy got home from work and soon after that we headed off. The car ride was long but it was alright...we kept ourselves busy n stuff. We got up to Starbuck about 9 and got settled in and stuff and then we headed off to bed.  Thursday: Tracy and I slept in till about 9 and got going...slowly ofcourse...showering is soo much work! Esspecially there. Gotta get all your crap in those bags and carry em over and use the nasty showers that has crappy pressure...but it worked out fine. Then we headed down to the beach and tanned from bout 1-5. Very nice day. Becky and her friend layed out by us and it was just an overall great day. Tho bout 3 or so Tracy and I went to get some pop to drink and I got these pokie things in my foot so we had to call docotor Sandy over to bring tweezers so I could pull em out. Those things were stuck in there pretty darn good. Then as we were leaving Tracy got one. LoL Just a great day for pokies! Then we went out to eat at A And after that we walked around...all the way down to the beach were we saw Paul and George. Fun stuff. We walked alot tho. Felt halfway thin that night....but not for long...We went to bed 11ish maybe...somethin...  Friday:Got up late and showered and around 2 we went down to the beach. This time we timed ourselves. 15 minutes on each side. I think we only lasted bout 3 rotations or so. But in the middle we went and got somethin to drink and there was two guys workin in the shack. One acted just like Gerry and another one looked just like Ross. It kinda...creeped me out. Yeah I think we nicknamed them too. So we went back and had supper and then went downtown to the parade. We actually got a good amount of candy. Fought off all the lil kids for it. LoL. Then we probably sat around the fire that night...then went to bed.  Saturday: Got up late again...and showered. We walked downtown and ate really good tacos. Weird thing was..I ate left handed. *shrug* Then we walked around and looked at stuff. I almost bought myself this really cute ring but I decided not to. Then we hid in the truck hoping Sandy and Tracys Aunt Pam wouldnt see us but they did. Oh well. We rode back in the pickup like that and then we did appsolutely nothing the rest of the day. So I called Ross later on since Jimmy and Tracy talked atleast once a day and I was going crazy. Tracy and I were both pretty hyper and I had really bad reception so who knows if he heard much. *shrug* Then we had supper and had DQ. OMG the French Vanilla Moolate...the best! Greatest thing. Then Tracy and I went along with Becky and Pat and all them on the lake to watch the fireworks. The lake was sooo full of boats! They put on a really good fireworks show. After that we all sat around the fire and watched the neighbors get drunk. It was interesting cuz there were the Kenny Chesney wanna bes and the Eminem wanna bes. It was just...interesting. One of the "cowboys" came over and started talkin to us cuz we were kinda yellin at them n stuff and Tracy asked if he was an actual cowboy and if he had cows that go moo. It was soo hilarious. Terry kinda yelled at him n stuff. Great intertainment! LoL Yeah then we went off to bed...  Sunday:Got up late...once again...showered then had a big lunch. It was cloudy n cold but warm at times. We were bored and layed around did barely anything. We took Ming (sp?) on a walk. Ming is Pam and Daves dog which is Tracys Aunt and Uncle I belive. Yeah. So that amused us. Then we went tubbin for awhile. Becky drove us. It was fun...untill my asthma acted up and it then sucked. It was horrid. I made them bring me back to the boat..and then Beckys boyfriend rode with Tracy. Then when that was all done we showered and hung around....sat around the campfire for a long time. We took Natalie and Nathan to the park there...where this lil boy was getting yelled at. Then I found out his name was Ross...gave me a lil laugh...Then we went back to the fire and sat around while all the "young-ish" people talked. Terry and Larry got married...they lit their sparklers together and it was a bonding moment. It was funny. Those two are hilarious together. Then they all went to bed and Pat, Tracy, and I sat around the fire until super late talkin bout stupid endless things. I got amused by random fireworks that went off...and they laughed at me. LoL. Yeah then we went to bed.   Today: We got up at a decent time and Sandy made us pancakes. I hadnt had pancakes since November when we had them at the fireman breakfast...when Ross was here. The only time he was here. He needs to come back...wonder if he ever will...Anyways then we showered and packed everything into the pickup. And round 2 we headed back for home. Bout the whole last hour it just down poured. It was pretty bad. We couldnt see the road to well...but we made it alright. Im living proof. So yeah I got home bout 6 and thats bout it. I had a great time with Tracy. Tons and tons of fun...and if anyone is still reading all this I'd be amazed....I wrote alot...Oh well...I'll let ya all go now...
