I mean it wasn't 'til a little while ago.  I just... feel like crapsticks right now, man. Like I can't do anything right, that I'm never going to be anything important.  Sort of like the opposite of those 'fuck you, god/diety' moments. Sorta.   I'm still like 'fuck you', but in more of a 'fuck off and leave me the hell alone' kinda way.  Maybe it's because I was the only person who cried at the end of Traviatta today. >   WHAAAT THE FUCKKKKK!  And now I'm listening to the Grand Gate of Kiev, which -always- makes me feel better.   And it's not working.   I'm still fucking -crying- my eyes out, damn it to all hell.  AGHRHGHSJKLHSDFK!    WHY do I feel like I can do nothing right lately?    I'm: DEPRESED//andconfused.  Alias: ELLE//fin.
