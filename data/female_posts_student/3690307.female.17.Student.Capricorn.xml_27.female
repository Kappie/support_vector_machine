I will soon change the picture (If I can figure out how) and also try to find out how to fix the comments so they don't just show themselves like whores all the time. You know what I mean? They're just there when you open the thingy! It's too sudden, I think, to have the comments hanging out like that. I like the slight tension and excitement you get from reading a good blog, and then looking at the bottom, and "Oh, yes. How wonderful, there are some comments!" See, more pleasurable. At least, that's what I think... It might be my own opinion. If anybody knows how to fix this blunder of mine, (I tried the whole  shit, but it didn't work) please tell me.
