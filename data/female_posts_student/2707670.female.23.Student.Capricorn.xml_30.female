I don't even know what I was going to say but let me tell you we had some fun last night. We stared out making some strong daiquiris. Then they moved on to margaritas (I stuck with water as I was driving) but we didn't have much mix so six of us piled in a pickup and went to the liquor store for more mix. All in all it was a great night but class this morning was rough for a few of the Mayhemers. Anyway I am going to see the Moscow Radio Orchestra tonight so it should be fun and then we may end up with another night of Madness!
