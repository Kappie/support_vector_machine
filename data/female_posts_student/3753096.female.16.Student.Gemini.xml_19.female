I saw you standing in that line  When your eyes brushed and held with mine   And you saw me standing there  Staring back like I don't care   About you  But I do   I still can't talk to you that way  I still don't know what I would say   Yes, I know that they  all  say  You give a part of you away   Instead, I carried you with me  And you, you liked to laugh at me   And then standing in that line  I knew the laughter was all mine   I saw you standing in that line  Out of space and out of time   I saw that strange look in your eye  Me pinned there like a butterfly   I saw your smile in that line  And it told me I'd be fine
