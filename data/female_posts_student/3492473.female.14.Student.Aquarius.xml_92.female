Then my grandpa got remarried to  some bitch  (seriously) and she became my mom's step mother. She also died. When my mom was sixteen. So when my mom started working at this restaurant when she about sixteen she met this older woman who was  amazing.  I don't know all the details but almost forty years later that woman is still in my mother and my life. Her name is Rosie. My mom always called Rosie  "mom"  and Rosie always looked out for my mom. She's always been really close to my family so I think of her as my grandma or something like that. But recently Rosie's husband found our he has like  three different cancers.  And it's freaking horrible. He has like liver, lung, and heart cancer. I know lung cancer for sure but the two I'm weary on. I saw them a few weeks ago and George looked awesome. And I was relieved in a sense. But today Rosie called and said  George is in the hospital  and I'm just upset because it sucks. Number two. Yesterday when I went to the library we rented a bunch of DVD's. I decided to get What a Girl Wants with Amanda Bynes because I wanted to see it when it came out but never did and thought what the heck. So tonight I decided to watch it since there was nothing else to do. I thought it was gonna be corny but I was sooo wrong. It is now  one of my favorite  movies. I cried  so  much! The movie was so awesome. And I understood what the main character (Amanda) went through with always wondering if she'd be able to dance with her dance at her wedding.  Like I dunno how many nights I cried myself to sleep wondering if my dad was ever gonna see me before Prom or be at my graduation.  Although my dad is back in my life, it's not like the movie where the parents get back together. Despite everything and forgetting the reasons my parents got divorced,  part of me has always wished they'd get back together.  Just so we could all be happy again, ya know? But it's for the best that they are apart. And it was crazy! Just the other day, Jules sent me all these quotes and she sent me one that made so much sense that I fell in love with it.  "Why are you trying to fit in when you were born to stand out?"  I think that I was born to stand out.  All my life  I've tried fitting in and everything like that but for some reason,  none of it felt right.  So I guess I sorta live my that quote now since I feel it describes how I feel so perfectly. So as I'm watching the movie Amanda is on a date with some very cute and super sweet boy she met. And they're laying in the boat as the boy asks Amanda,  "Why are you trying so hard to fit in when you were born to stand out?"  I was like, "WTF?!" That's fucking awesome! My new favorite quote is in my favorite movie! So that made me love the movie even more. And oh my lord! It was so cute. The whole relationship with Amanda and the kid in the movie was totally "awe" worthy. Number three. I hate it how people have to say certain things that upset you but they don't even know it. Like this person said all this shit to me and  acted like I was suppose to be the happiest person in the world.  But in reality, the crap they said,  pretty much made me cry.  It was just like,  "Why now? Why? I don't understand..."  And then I tried to talk to someone about it and he just said "oh" and the other person I wanna talk to, I can't. So right now I'm just really confused and in need of talking to  one  person...I hate it. Whenever I need someone, they're not there or don't even try...And then they wonder why...
