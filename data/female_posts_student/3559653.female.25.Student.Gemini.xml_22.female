Soon it will be sweltering hot and I'll probably be complaining about that! I worked today and then pretty much took it easy tonight, cleaned a bit and just puttered around with the cats/fish. :) I'm thoroughly engrossed in the season premiere of "For Love or Money 2" (total 'reality' TV addict!), so this is gonna be a short entry!  Word of the Day: Snar-i-bou (derived from 'snuggie' and 'caribou'). Malcolm and I had caramel caribou ice cream for dessert so I think we know where that word came from! haha.  More tomorrow!
