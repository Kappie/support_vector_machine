I waited for my roommate for the longest time and she never came for a long long time, but at like almost 2:30ish i met her. My roommates name is Sarah Balney, she is a great/amazing person. i had soo much fun talking to her and hanging out with her the whole time we were there on the first day. we then had a meeting in our city hall to meet n greet all the girls who were selected to go to girls state. it was a great privalage to have such an amazing city and to have great friends. we walked into the room as strangers and we will walk out as best friends, the week we spent together will be remembered forever, since it was a great privilage to be selected for such a great thing. We then explored the campus with our city, *Z* showes us where things were and where to find everything. after that we ate dinner with our cities, and we then had a bond to each other, i then started to hang out with nicole, krysta and bridget. at 8 pm we all went as a city to the upper convo room to have our opening ceremony, it was kind of boring but i guess u'll have that sometimes. after we had our opening ceremony we started to form our businesses and have some fun. it was a great day n it had soo many memories, i'm glad that i got a chance to go to this.
