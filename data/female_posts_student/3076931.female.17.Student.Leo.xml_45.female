Sometimes I get caught up in my own thoughts that my thoughts are only what I see and hear and I really don't pay attention to what is going on around me.  I've had this empty feeling in my stomach (and no, it's not hunger) for the past week and I don't know what it is. Maybe I just don't know what sadness is.  I sat up waiting for his phone call...and when he did call it didn't even light up anything.  I wasn't sad about that.  I don't know what I'm sad about.  And it really bothers me because I usually have a specific reason of why I am sad.  It's scary that I don't know.  The feeling won't go away.  I've never really been too good with my sadness, I guess.  Correction- I've never been too good at  expressing  my sadness.  And I guess thats a good thing. But sometimes I guess it could be a  bad thing. I don't know.   I hope to be seen as a happy and optimistic person, because that is what I am 99% of the time.  Even if I'm upset about something, I usually don't let it show.  I don't know why that is.  I need to freakin get over this sad and alone feeling.  It's making me sick and ant-social.  It's making me a different person that I don't want to be.  I still want to be the same happy person as I've always been.     I don't know what to think of myself half the time.  Don't misunderstand. I am   NOT   depressed by any means.  Everyone goes through a period of sadness and I think it's just my time.  And I'm not doing the whole take pity on me deal either.  I don't need other people's pity.  I just need to get over this stupid sadness feeling. It's just a point in my life where I'm starting to think about everything: my future, my past, my relationships (that have been non-existant), dumb-ass things I've done, EVERYTHING.  I've been over analyzing everything about myself.  And it needs to stop.  I just need to sit back and breath for a little bit.
