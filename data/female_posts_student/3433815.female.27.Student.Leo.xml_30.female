I have finally had some good things happen to me emotionally, physically and financially. I have lost some good friends in the process of    your    choice and continue to lose them because of so, and I must also move on from that too. But yet   you   must keep drudging up everything by texting, calling, emailing or instant messaging me? I now know that   you   like to bring misery into peoples lives by what   you   keep currently doing to me.   You   made the choice to cheat and screw around,   you   made the choice to tell me to my face that all I was to   you   was a fu*k,   you   made the choice to be with someone else. So I am not in anyway of   your   life. I am not calling, texting or emailing   you  .   You   wanted to move on, so LET ME. All   you   are proving by texting, emailing, calling me is that   you   have no feelings nor care for ANYONE, not only for what it does to me, but what about   your   girlfriend?! I am single and it is perfectly ok for me to be signed on to American Singles or any other online singles profile, but that does not mean it is ok for   you   to be emailing me or instant messaging me thru them. I don't (nor I necessarily care) think   your   girlfriend would like to see   you   online there searching for singles, or even to see what   your   profile says   you   are looking for, disgusting. All I ask is once again, STOP, leave me alone, this is what   you   wanted, so live it.
