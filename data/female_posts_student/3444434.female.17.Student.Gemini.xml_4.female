I wouldnt miss a damn thing about Washington, except my mother! I mean there are things that i would maybe miss and do care about, but they are things that will most likely change anyways, everything does. The one thing that will always remain is my mom so why should i try hard to hold on when sooner or later will be gone no matter how hard i try.       Last time i was here was last summer. I was here for a month and well in that month i met josh. Josh is....well i dont know exactly yet, but hes wonderful. He makes me feel so open, so willing, so volnurable, but not in a bad way. When i very first met him he was just a cute guy, but after i hung out with him a couple times i swore to myself i would marry him...CRAZY i know im only 16, but it was how i felt(feel)and it was pretty scary. I just thought to myself what is wrong with you, you just met this guy you cant really have these sorts of feeling for him its rediculos. And i just kept telling myself its alright its probly nothing your just getting carried away again.. your thinking to much.. its just a lil crush like the rest.     Well, i lost my virginity to him. And well i always wanted to be in love when i first have sex and have it be sooo perfect and the perfect guy,setting everyhing, every girls fantasy. Well it wasnt PERFECT it wasnt a FANTASY. But at the same time it was. It was the right guy, right timing, it just felt right. I don't regret a thing.  Im glad i waited, and didnt take all those other opportunities i had, cuz i would have regreted it. I was soo scared and soo nervous and usually being nervous stops me from doing things, but for some reason it didnt this time. I just gave in to it and im glad i did.       I spent alot of time with him over my month stay and the more and more time i spent the more and more the emotions and feeling just overtook me. I would come home from his house and tell my sister..."sarah, hes it..im telling you i will marry this man. no doubt about it i will marry him!" In this short period of time i was with him i thought i knew that he was the one. I felt so silly for feeling this way, but i let myself. Instead of telling myself no jess your leaving, its only going to bring pain in the end, stop while your ahead, i just let myself fall. Harder and Harder with every moment i spent with him. It was like all the memorie i would have and the feelings i felt while with him was worth any pain i would feel later on. And i didnt care. After coming home at night and being all happy and giddy, i would lie on the couch with the tv on and cry because i knew i had to leave, i knew there was that chance of me never seeing him again after i left. And the thought of that made me so sick and sad. I even cried to him about. Feeling so unbelievably stupid about it i still did.      I just prayed that maybe he'll fall in love with me and just HAVE to be with me and something great will happen...maybe he'll move to washington for me...maybe i can move here....maybe this maybe that. Getting completely carried away. I felt DUMB!
