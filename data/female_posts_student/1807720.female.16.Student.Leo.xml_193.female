We got lost like a million times, and yeah I made a couple u-turns.  Yup, I broke the law.  Then a couple assholes wouldn't let me in so basically I ALMOST hit them, but instead of clipping them, I just swerved back into my lane.  On out way back, so guy pulling out of a parking lot almost hit me to, but my car is fine and everyone else is too, so that's good!   It was so much fun though last night.  We ordered like tons of Greek food, and had lots of Greek desserts and everything.  Then we went to the face painting both and we all got mustaches with goatee's painted on.  OMG, it was so funny.  Then the kids that saw us with them painted on our faces, were all like "lets get mustaches guys, then we saw little girls starting to do it too."  I suppose we started a trend, or we are pretty influence and great role models!  Then we went back to my house and we took a picture of us with our sporty mustaches on.  Then I drove everyone back to Megz.  The ride from the Greek Festival on the way home was the best though.  I still had to concentrate on driving, but when we stopped at red lights we all yelled OPA, and you have to remember we looked strange too, with all that stuff painted on our face.  They also had a whole bunch of Greek dancing to watch, and that was really neat.  Not that I am like into Greek a lot or anything, but it's like totally different from the Ukrainian culture - foods and dancing.  Anyways, my mom assumes that when I say I like something, it's some sort of indication for her to go out and buy like 10 of whatever it is that I said I liked.  Like these yogurt granola bars.  One day I was like "yum, they are so good.  You know what she did...She bought a box of vanilla, a box of blueberry, and a box of strawberry.  Now she won't stop buying them.  I try to eat them quick so I don't have to see them anymore, then she just goes while I am sleeping to safeway and comes home with more food that I don't need!!  I can tell it's the beginning of holidays.  Already I feel kind of like a slave, but I mean I guess doing things for your parents is kind of expected.  My mom wanted to me take the newspapers from out garage to like a newspaper drive they are having at Bishop O'Byrne.  Ok, so I was kind of upset by her telling me this, but then I just felt like I was doing something to help out the community.  It took forever to load the newspapers into boxes and bags, and then carry them to the car.  Like seriously I swear my mother has been saving since Christmas.  I mean if they world didn't have newspapers, they would save a heck of a lot of trees!
