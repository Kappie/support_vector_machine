We have a lot in common and it is really cool.  May i suggest others do the same.  I dont regret it.  Its nice to meet someone new every now and then.  also i read this blog of an iraqi. now that was interesting.  to see what they write about blew my mind.  dear_raed.blogspot.com...you should read. anyway i got to go do my homework. see you all later.
