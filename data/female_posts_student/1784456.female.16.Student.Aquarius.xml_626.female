Well, cause I'm kind of anemic (I don't have enough iron) I need to eat healthy food. :( :( :( (That's not good news!) Hey, I'm getting to it! Any way, I have to eat LICORICE PANDAS! Wooohooooooooo! Yeah, I love licorice! and the pandas taste lush! Sorry, slightly happy! Ooh, and I'm doing Grade 4 piano and it's hard! You have to do all this scabby singing and noticing notes and stuff and it's like yeaaah... sure, I can do that *not*. Hehe, but any waaaay! Total madness craze of people going into Bristol! Yeay! Did any one ever have their sanity? Is their such a thing as sanity?
