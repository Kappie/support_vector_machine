Bruce didn't even know how to spell Snoelle's name until about a minute ago. Does that qualify as child abuse? Can you imagine the police report if she ever ran away? "so, tell me, sir, how do you spell your daughter's name?" "uh...I'm not sure. You'll have to ask her mother. I just come over to pull her paws and meow back at her..."    And then I remember that they're cats and dogs and that this is crazy lady talk. I'm going to bed now. :)      urlLink
