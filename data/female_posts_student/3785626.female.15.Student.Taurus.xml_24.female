It seems like people with problems seem to gravitate towards me, I'm not saying my friends are problems, I'm just saying they seem to come to me with help. I'm thinking of becoming a psychiatrist or psychologist, but I don't want to start analyzing my family and friends. And they say the highest suicide rate is caused by psychiatrists, because they hear all those problems. But maybe a counselor, they aren't as bad? Or maybe just a sociologist? Study human behavior. I really like listening to peoples problems I don't know why....It's strange.    Anyways I've talked to Tregory almost all frikkin' day. YAY. Last night he said he would call but he didn't he fell asleep. He's getting bad at that. I hate it when all those "what if's" go through your head...BLACH.   well later.
