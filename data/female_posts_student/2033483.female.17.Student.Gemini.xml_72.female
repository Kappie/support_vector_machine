I dreamt that I decided to go to U of M in the Twin Cities and my family and I went on a campus visit, but my parents decided that they weren't going to let me go because the campus was too big.  But the campus in my dream didn't look like the campus that newspaper visited in April.  What could this dream mean?    This morning was rather boring.  I did some Algebra homework.  Around noon I think it was I went to Brad's open house.  Then I came home and helped my mommy clean.  I've discovered my mom's hidden plot to trick me into going to Wal-mart.  She has this way of telling me we're going one place and somehow we end up at Wal-mart.  Take today for example, she said we were going to the mall so I was all for that but then somehow after the mall we mysteriously needed to go to Wal-Mart too.  This wouldn't matter all that much except I don't like going to Wal-mart.  And last time this happened I needed a notebook and she said she didn't know what kind I wanted so I would have to go along if I wanted it.  What is so hard about picking up a notebook?  Today, I found a song that describes how I felt about someone seven months ago.  It's by Slick Shoes and it's their song "Regrets."  You have to switch the girl to a guy but it totally fits to where I was at then.  I really wish I would have found this song earlier.  The last line of the song is "I know I'll always love you. I wish that you felt the same."  Atleast I know Renae still has faith because if you loose faith then you lose the magic of what was.  Or whatever philosophical shit she through at me that night.  Which in fact was quite enlightening.    signing off, ~Kaylala
