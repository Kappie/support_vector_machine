Amber complains about it because I don't have to take the finals I about three of my classes. Well she can get over it.  Last night no one was in the high school class, so I didn't get to play my joke on some of the people, I get them Sunday or sometime next week. I bet some stayed home to watch AI. For those who don't know what AI stands for it stands for America Idol. Fantasia won last night which a lot of people here in Nitro or just in Music App. Class thought Diana was going to win.   First block is one of the best class, our teacher just bought us some donuts holes, plus we have already taken our final so all we do in here is just get on the computer and play games was the awards assembly for the seniors which the whole school gets out of the morning class to watch. Hey, I'm not complaining since I got out of one class.
