You walk around in a trance. A daze if I dare to say. I think about you all night. Do you think of me all day. Life seems meaningless. Fulfilment is so far. The pain inside is bigger. Bigger than before. I never knew you knew me. I never thought you had. I never hoped this on you. I think it is really sad. You walk around thinking. Your better than him or her. When in all honesty, compared to you they are superb. You think your all that. And a bag of chips to add. You so pathetic on the outside. But inside you are so sad. You dream of suicide. The day you hope you’ll die. You hope for today. but maybe tomorrow. Your heart is filled with sorrow. You try to think of a way. Painless and so fast. You look at a picture and it takes you to the past. The life you’ll miss forever. The one where you want to go back. Change so many things. All the things that got off track. Now you cant do anything. Your time on earth is done. You thought you were leading a good life. But that’s where you went wrong. Now you spend eternity, burning in the flames. All because you fucked her, and didn’t know her name.
