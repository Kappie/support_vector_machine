Okay so I've been thinking about the news I heard first period since I heard it and I'm not quite sure what to make of it really. Then other stuff happened and now I'm more confused than ever...I'm so utterly confused as to what is happening, I don't know how to comprehend it even..the best thing would be to talk it out so both people know what is really going on...but who knows..I have no words, I just need to lay down...here's some lyrics... "Let me be angry, please it is the only way I can keep you from seeing how much you mean to me." -unknown "Two wrongs don't make it right and if I'm wrong, I ain't trying to fight."-wyclef jean "I want to make this work so much it hurts."-martina mcbride "It only gets harder the more that you know; You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down; We came together but we left alone;Maybe someday i will see you again and you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend."-yellowcard "makes you do the strangest things like act angry. It's your life, your move, your chance to make good of the bad. Can't hide the fact that you still lied but put the past behind, there's one more thing left to say."-moneen "i need you, tears on my pillow whenever you go"-destiny's child
