Heh, actually Scott, I don't quite know...I don't really use the computer much...I only use L337 (how I spell it, anyway) just cuz of how much of a bad rap it has, being the accepted 'net geek language and all. 90% of everything I say is based off of "how overused is this", and if it's trite enough, it becomes a part of my standard vocabulary long after it dies down in the mainstream.  Heheheh...well Linds...Abby can tell you about how the cooking went...a massive groan on my part. I was just distracted by my wonderful girlfriend and the suckers kinda...that's enough I think.  Happy fourth to all.
