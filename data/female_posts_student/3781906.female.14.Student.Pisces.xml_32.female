He changed my view of the people around me and he reached out to me like never before. For the first time in a LONG time, I was ALMOST speachless. I feel great, I'm rested (In the lord :D ), and my drive for writing has returned. I pray that I will be able to sustain this... I never what to let this feeling go!  I am begining to look forward to the family vacation. It will be quite the test for me. I need to work on my short fuse, and this may be my chance. It's horrible being around me sometimes, I'm sure. For all of you that I have flipped out on, I am really sorry. Pray for me!  Today I contacted an old friend of mine in the States. I haven't heard from her since the first of the year. She was also a christian, so I felt compelled to tell her what happened on Sunday. When she picked up the phone, I hardly reconized her. Her voice was haggard and she sounded as if she was depressed. I asked her what was wrong.  Apparently, she is no longer a believer. She, like me, was burned by the church, and had run away from it all. She told me of her saturday nights partying with people twice her age, getting drunk, and a violent fight she had with her father.    After I finished my call, I felt as if I was going to faint. Hearing my friend, who walked me though my troubled times when I lived in the states, ask me to get drunk with her the next time I saw her, scared me, but also made me feel very privilaged. It made me realise that I am very lucky to be where I am today. If it were't for God's Grace leading me to the Father's House, I wouldn't be hear.  So, I send out a prayor request for my friend. Her name is Treva. Pray for her, that she will be safe and that God will reveil herself to her.   Also, my mother is having test done tomorrow on her kidney. Pray that I all is well.  Thanks,  Amber
