I was wearing some sort of strappy dress and one of the men in the group put his hand down the back of it, it finally coming to rest both between my shoulder blades and my left hip.  He mentioned that all the women were cold because we did not dress for the weather.  I went to change into something warm.  There were also a new kind of bike in my dream.  In the dream I did not know why they had not invented them earlier, and I was buying white hightop biking shoes.  Also in my dream there was a test of love where you were suppose to stick your hand in a bucket that was filled with ice and razor blades.  I declined.  Ahhhh, the glory of sleep.  When I woke up my window was leaking in frigid air, and my shoulders were cool to the touch.  I let myself slowly emerge from where ever I had been in the night, and the morning has progressed in a sleepy but speedy haze.  I spent some time at the hospital emergency room last night with a friend.  Everything is fine, but the experience it self was unnatural.  We sat in a room separated by thin blue sheets on hooks.  Next to us to one side was a minor who was in there to be detoxed.  The other side I paid little attention to.  The only thing that I had to read was Chuck Palahniuk's Survivor.  If you want a truly painful hospital experience, read Palahniuk out loud in the emergency room.  Painful, but somehow lighter then it otherwise could have been.  I am reading in a quiet but urgent voice, since that is what the text demands, about a faux suicide hotline.  The people call up the main character and he tells them, "go ahead, no there is nothing to live for."  It was morbid and ridiculous.  I read quieter and thought the whole thing terribly funny.  Maybe I'm sick, but it was really very poetic.    There is a shining evening out, glowing but chill.  I have gotten little done today, other then cook with my sister.  There are assignments hanging over my head.  Tomorrow will have to be productive.  The roses that I received are dying, pink petals curling into condensed bruised flush.  The temporal nature of things is sometimes shocking to me.  It was suggested the other night that sometimes true and utter stillness is the key to understanding.  I had an exaggerated fear of that stillness, thinking that the idea even could make me stagnate.  Why the harsh reaction?  Possibly I am afraid of stillness, change being something that I have just learned to embrace?  Possibly it is the time spent still, waiting for movement, and what if that movement never came?  It always does though.  Look into nature and you can see that true stillness is impossible.  There is a chance that the whole is truly still, that in the movement that we perceive in the changing of seasons and fall of snow, there is truly one pattern that is fixed.  I don't think that I'm ready to see that pattern, there is much walking to be done first.  My mother gave me a bonzi as a gift.  I am entranced by it, but at the same time am loath to control it.  I don't want to examine it and make the choice that this branch is too long, this one is too short, there is no perfection.  What is nature if not wild?  Why try to place false constraints.  It seems to be an exercise in making yourself small, tight, with out passion, critical.  I'll tend it and let it grow, see where this tiny thing decides to take me.   It seems that I am still avoiding our assingment, the one about politics.  Hurumph.  One more thing to do I need not, so I might as well take a shot while I am already typing, yeah?  I have played with many political affiliations, and decided on none.  I don't like the idea of black and white.  It doesn't fit, and so I ignore it.  Polarizing yourself makes it impossible to take into account the complexity of any problem.  So I have been entertained by anarchy recently, but am not well enough versed in it to call it truth.  The ideas are intriguing, but are not embraceable as of yet.  Socialism is also entertaining, though for more practical reasons.  I would certainly not associate with either the democratic party or the republican party.  I like some aspects of different political theories, like feminism, and Marxism, and environmentalism.  I have ideas, and am comfortable with that.    I don't really like money, but that's easier to say when I have it then when I don't.  I am very very uncomfortable with big business, or corporations, or transnational corporations.  Scarey things lead that way.  Not sure, always trying to be flexible, ready for most conversations, if the others participating are willing to let ideas be just that.  If people are willing to talk about and act on things that they have really talked about... well, then we can see.   Two young girls just walked by on the street.  One had flaming red hair, and was tall and was wearing black.  The other had dark hair and was wearing red.  They looked like the queen of spades and the queen of hearts waiting to become playable.
