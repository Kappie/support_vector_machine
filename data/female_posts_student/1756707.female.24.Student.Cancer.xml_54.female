A friend was talking about how he was reading this girl's blog because he liked her, and he knew all these things about her like when she got a boyfriend, etc. But I don't think he was posting comments on the blog, just reading it.   So what about voyeurism with blogs? What about people out there who are reading them and not commenting on them? I know my friends, the ones reading and commenting, but there's no requirement to comment, and no reason why one can't follow your every step based on your blog. Interesting, and a bit scary.
