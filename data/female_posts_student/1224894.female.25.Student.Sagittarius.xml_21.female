Then was about to start chatting when my cellphone alarm went off...and reminded me that I have a lector serve at 6 am. Tsk...tsk...after i gulped some hot coffee...i changed for my uniform and went off to Church.  Then when i got back home at around 7, i was supposedly going to take a nap...or just a short rest, but, i had to help prepare the kids for their parade which started at promptly 8:30 after their thanksgiving mass...And at 9 i i had to attend the wedding which started so late by the way, that Fr. Ruel got really upset since the wedding ruined his schedule. Reminders: tell Ging Alita to have it discussed during pre-cana seminar.  My Mom and I got invited for lunch at the convent with both parish priest and vicar...BDW, Uncle Maning started the Church decorations for the upcoming Opening Salvo on Dec. 16 at 4 am.  I had my pedicure and manicure since i'll be judging a beauty pageant at 7 pm. We came home from the convent at 5 in the afternoon...i'm sooooo tired.  At 7, together with Ma and Auntie Rufa, we went to SMCC...and fortunately, the co-judges are friends of mine. Mimi and Gary...already booked a dance with Gary, but, Ma decided we get home early. So, after the pageant, we went home at around 10:30.  Now, i'm facing my monitor trying to write down the events of the past day...and now decided to take that well deserved sleep since 4 this morning.
