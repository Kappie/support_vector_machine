[going to king arthur tomorrow with amanda (walker), leslee and carlos. right now i'm watching canadian idol like a complete prat, wating to see jacob and kalan, cause their hot. and bloody hell, catwoman is actually looking like a good movie... this is wrong. gawd kalan is good looking, and he plays the fiddle and lives on a ranch in medicine hat alberta. i was just there! he was jsut singing born to be wild. he's so rock and roll kiddie, i love him to death... and he's a curly, floppy hair 18 year old. two year difference... that's a good age gap. anyways...
