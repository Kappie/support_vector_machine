When ever I get into the nave, a sense a calmness and security comes over me.  It's a good feeling.  Father Joe tried to inspire us to give up more evils in our lives and spend more quiet time with God for this Holy Week.  I told myself that I would listen to music less such as in the car and in the morning when I'm getting ready.  But so far that hasn't worked out too well.    Today was good.  In Algebra the smelly kids made fun of me.  First they made fun of Ryan for liking rock music like Godsmack and not rap.  So I stood up for him b/c I don't like rap.  The larger smelly one said "I can't believe this quiet girl likes rock music she probably rocks out to it in her room"  (rolling my eyes)  Brett Kollars and I got to talking about music some how I don't remember how but he said he liked Ben Folds so I asked if he was going to see him.  He said he couldn't for some reason but his gf was going.  I wish I could go...oh wait I am going (I'm sneaking in...lol)  Lit and comp was vocabish.  History was hellish.  Lunch was foodish.  In chem we boiled pop.  In physics we watched a movie.  We were slow in Newspaper today because the computers were being dumb.    After school I had to pick up Ty and bring him home.  I got a call from American Eagle and I have an interview on Saturday the 17th at 9 o'clock.  So cross your fingers b/c I need a job.    Later Gater
