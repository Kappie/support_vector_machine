It feels like I was supposed to go because my whole day revolved around it; I went to Charlotte's and did her make up and I made her look pur-ritty.. I wish I got to see them off cause I didnt' get to see Nick's outfit all put together, but yeah it's really funny I was like, their stylist... I picked out both of thier outfits and put Charlotte's together.... hehe. Now Amanda's sleepin' over and we went to Wendy's and I'm glad I'm actually doing something today. Maybe not what I was planning originally (...) but I'm doing something.
