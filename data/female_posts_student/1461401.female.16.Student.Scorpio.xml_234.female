I was considering going to see Peter Pan with cassie and kat today, but I don't think I'll be able to. Then amber was thinking about coming over, but I think even if she does call me about that I would have to decline. I look like crap, and the house is prtty much under contruction at the moment. I think I'm going to go veg infront of the TV while watching the princess bride and pray that the tylenol I just took kicks in soon. (or that someone will take me to grounds for an emergency coffee break) But I guess I can't just mope around here all day.
