That's what I do, is it not? Maybe it's just because you don't know me so you can't read inbetween the lines. But I know I talk about my problems for sure. Like I said before, if you have a problem with it,  no one is making you read this.  Carly, thank you very much for backing me up. And whoever left a comment after Car, thanks to you too. See, that person thinks I talk about my problems too. Alrite, get ready, because this is gonna be one hell of a post. Last night I went to bed at 4:30ish and Dave (my step dad) woke me up at 9ish to ask if I wanted to go to the beach. I told my mom last night that I'd go so I told Dave and he said I could sleep til 10. So I finally got up around 10 with a lot of trouble.  I just wanted to sleep.  So I got up, ate, got ready, and left. It was crazy because for the first time in  a while , my whole family was up by 10. We're the type of family who stays up all night and sleeps all afternoon. When we first got to the beach, there weren't many people so it was nice. Last time I went to the beach, it was like the 3rd of July, I got  burnt   sooo  bad.  I was even better than the Coppertone kid!  So today, I actually put on sun screen. That's something new for me. I know it's really bad that I usually don't wear any but  sometimes you just don't care.  I was gonna try to put it on before we left (like you're supposed to so it has time to absorb into your skin) but my parents wanted to leave so I had to wait til I got to the beach. After that, I went to look for water glass with my mom. She's like crazy for that stuff so every time I go to the beach, I look for a bunch and give her what I find. She gets all  happy .  I  used  to be like that.  In like 2nd or 3rd grade  I had some phase I went through.  I was like crazy about rocks.  They were so fascinating to me.  But I guess I just grew out of it. Although, I still find some pleasure in looking for water glass and other strange rocks. After awhile, I got tired so I went to lay down and tan for a bit. I guess I fell asleep because I remembered having a dream that seemed soo real but my parents came back (they went on a walk to look for some water glass and rocks) and were like, "Maybe you should turn?"  It brought me back to reality.  The beach seemed so  unreal  when I was first waking up. It was like the beach was the dream. But it was the opposite. I wish I could remember that dream. It felt so weird. And I haven't had a dream that felt so real for a few months. So I switched sides and once again fell asleep. But I didn't have a dream that time. I ended up getting up and looking for more water glass with my mom. Ya wanna know something I've always wanted to do? I always wanted to walk the  whole  beach. Like from one end to the other. I think it'd be really cool, especially if I went with a guy.   Romantic?   I say. Every time I go to the beach,  I get disappointed.  There are  never  any cute guys. And if I do get hit on, it's by  younger  kids. It's like,  where are the hot guys  and  what's wrong with me that the little ones hit on me?  So I didn't think I got too burnt. Turns out, I was wrong.  Very wrong.  The back of my legs are all burnt, the bottom of my back, part of my top, my chest, my tummy...  All burnt.  Oh well, it doesn't hurt.   Yet.   I came home and called Kristina to see if she wanted me to give her LOTF and if she wanted to hang out for a little bit but I forgot she went to Splash Lagoon with the twins.  So I was pretty bummed about that.  Then I took a walk down the street because I had to deliver something for Mrs. Laboda but the people weren't home so I'll just try again tomorrow. Then I came home, cleaned and did some crunches. If you didn't realize, I clean  a lot.  I'm pretty much a clean freak. I say my room is a mess if I have  a few  things of clothes out of place. I know, I'm  very  anal about my room. After that, I went online and talked to people. Julia sent me a bunch of quotes so that was cool.  I'm quote crazy.  I seriously think they're amazing. I've been a little confused lately because I think I like someone but that's what my head is telling me.  My heart isn't.  My heart is telling me to like someone else. So I don't know what to do or even how I really feel. I read something where it said to try to solve your problems  in the back of your mind.  Meaning, don't make them your priority. Because, eventually,  everything will be solved.  I believe that, so that's what I'm trying to do. But it's weird.  For the first time in awhile, it just feels good to be me. To be single, to be alone, to think clearly, to breath freely. It felt as if I was trapped before.  If I have to write a paper once I get back to school about what I did this summer, I know exactly what I'm gonna say.  "It's more what I  didn't  do this summer."  I seriously thought this was gonna be  the  summer. Where I was out partying every night, never home, always with my friends. But it's almost the complete  opposite.  It was like that in the beginning but then things just changed. At first I was upset about it all but  now I take it all as a   blessing.  Like when was the last time I've had  more than a month to do whatever I wanted?  To sit around reading all day, to sleep in, to give my face a break from all the make up, to give me hair a break from all that styling? It feels so good. And I think because of this,  I'm happy.   I've kind of found part of me I lost awhile back.  So then I got ready for soccer. I was waiting for practice all day. I wanted to see if all that conditioning was gonna help my game. When I got there, we were taking shots on the goal but I wasn't in the mood so I just talked to Nicole. After that, we did our warm up lap and stretched. Next, we did three on a ball. Which is weird because it was Sunday and we do that on Wednesday's. Oh well. So I was doing alright. It was really hot though. So we got to the ball dribbling part. Instead of waiting to go as a team like we usually do, everyone was just going when they got the ball. Lucas was going really slow so I was the last one to get the ball. I'm not too clear on what happened but I was dribbling and I was the last one and I guess the rest of the team was waiting for me and  I just tripped.  Quite embarrassing  but I was laughing.  So it was all good. I fell a lot today. Not little trips. But   BOOM   falls where I got grass strains on my shirt and I rolled over a bunch. I think conditioning did help my game. I think I was doing pretty well. Then there was some drama with Matt and coach and we had to stop scrimmaging and all listen and stuff. What Matt was saying, pissed me off, and I think the majority of the team. And I just thought it was ridiculous that he was acting so immature and freaking out over nothing. Then we started scrimmaging again. Soon it was time to go so we were all talking and I guess we don't have conditioning this week. I'm torn on whether that's good or not.  Like part of me wants to go because it was such a great work out and the other lazy half of me is glad to have a break.  So we have soccer Thursday. Although having practicing today and Thursday is  illegal.  I don't know why. It's just some state law that says you can't practice the first week of August. Oh well. I already break enough laws, what's wrong with adding a few more? So Eddie came and picked me up and we went home. My mom didn't make dinner because she wasn't in the mood so we got McDonald's.  I was craving my Big Mac soo bad.  So I started getting my food when Eddie called me in his room to see some pictures of his car. I didn't want to because I wanted to eat and I didn't wanna just leave my food on the table unprotected. My dogs have a tendency to get up on the table and steal food.  I know, bad dogs.  But I still went in his room thinking it'd be okay. I mean, there's been so many times where my dogs didn't steal my food. But  go figure  as we're looking at pictures, you hear something fall. You all know what's coming. Rascal (my newest and  most evil  dog) pulled my Big Mac down on the floor and started to eat it.  At that point, I lost it.  I went crazy. I started screaming at the dog. Screaming at my brother.  Just being a huge drama queen and bitch.  But I mean haven't you guys ever experienced a time when you wanted something so bad but somehow it got screwed up and you didn't? Well, that's how I felt.  All I wanted was that damn Big Mac.  But I couldn't eat it anymore.  I was on the verge of tears . I know that's very dramatic but I think I get overly sensitive and emotional when I'm on my period. I was just pissed after that. All I had left were my fries. And I kind threw half of those on the ground out of anger.  It wasn't a pretty sight.  I was being so mean to Eddie and he was being equally mean back to me and laughing at me. That's what I hate. When I throw those kind of fits,  he just laughs at me.  And he makes it worse if he didn't realize. The best thing to do is just agree with me and give me a hug. So then I took my fries and went into my room to blast Ashlee Simpson. I finally have her back! ha ha. I gave Carly my CD Thursday night so she could burn it and then we ended up not having practice til tonight so I was lonely with out her. Ya know what else really bugs me? This is my website and I can write whatever I want.  But in a way, I can't.  I know certain people read this on a daily basis so it sorta prevents me from writing some specific events that occur. Like in the past week, I've kept  so much  from you guys. And  it's driving me crazy  because I can't write about it so I have to talk to my one of my friends about it. Whatever.  You didn't think I was gonna tell you everything anyways right?  Ya wanna know something else that bugs me?   urlLink  www.poetry.com    I thought it was some awesome site when I came across it in 6th grade. I posted a bunch of my poems and continued throughout 8th grade. Some of my other friends and family members even came across it too. I always thought it was just a place to post poetry. I didn't know the poetry you posted was being judged and could be published. I didn't know that until I got a letter form them saying that they wanted to publish one of my poems. I was all excited and told my cousin. Surprisingly, he told me how he was once published from them and it was nothing special because they kept sending him stuff.  I refused to lose my happiness over his comments so I didn't think anything of it until later.  I started getting all these emails and letters for conventions and how I was chosen to be  a possible winner of Poet of the Year.  Like part of me still considers this flattering. But now I'm just sick of it all. I think it's just a bunch of bull shit. I haven't posted anything on that site in months but I still get shit for conventions and get letters about how they wanna publish my poems from like 6th grade. I'm sorry, I just think it's not a very good and true website. Oh well, here's a poem. I think it explains itself. It's about giving your heart away and having it broken. Hope you like.      Key   You broke my heart, Yes, you broke it in two. I gave you the key... You opened me up. You took your own hands, And ripped my heart apart. So now I'm lying on the floor, As my breathing is beginning to slow. I shouldn't have given you that key,
