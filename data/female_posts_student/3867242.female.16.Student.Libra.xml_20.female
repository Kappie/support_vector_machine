The only bad thing I have to say about the concert was the crappy dj that opened at the beginning. Some people behind me yelled "Bring out Maroon and Mayer!". Well when Maroon 5 came out the place went nuts. Girls crying, people screaming "at the tops of there lungs" (haha..I just had to throw a lyric line from "No Such Thing"..John's breakout song). But yeah Adam the lead singer just has an awesome stage presence about him..and James the lead guitar player kicked major...I just loved them. I swear that whole place wented crazy when they performed "She Will Be Loved". Now I want to rush to Border's and buy there CD. I also recommed there song "Sunday Morning"..great great song. The band was awesome..and again I love them. Then of course there my birthday buddy (I found out that John Mayer was born 10 years before me..on my b-day October 16th!). Gosh...seeing John Mayer  in person  was one of my life goals that was completed last night. All the way from singing "Clarity" to ending with "Neon" were the best 90 minutes ever! Of course I almost cried he sang "Wheel", "Your Body Is A Wonderland"..and so many good songs...and I loved the way he talked to the crowd. No my favorite part was he said for a few mintues "Why are musicans suddenly become political active these days?..there's singers for a reason..because they can't talk..so it doesn't matter to vote for red or blue..vote for you feel right about"..yeah I'm sick of celebrites and musicans telling us how to think on political issues but that's another story. Anyways..the crowd (including myself and my mommmy :) got so into the concert..and he came out for an encore! I thought it would be one song but it ended being four! The last song "Neon" John brought out James from Maroon 5 and they played awesome together!! They played the guitar behind there heads and then at the end they rammed the guitars together and played..it was awesome!! I also got to hear John's new song that won't be out until the record is out (which I hope is soon!)..and it talks about how people can suck at relationships! (I swear this should be my theme song!!!!!!!)..but yeah THE BEST CONCERT I'VE BEEN TO YET!! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
