But I prevailed and went to school sick anyway in seek of knowlegde.  I have to LEARN!  However, Renae was gone and I was forced to fend for myself at Lunch and in Newspaper.  A lot of people were gone today though.    Well I found that people do actually read my blog and ask questions.  Huh...didn't think that would happen.  But, ah yes, I have another crush in newspaper class.  But it's just that a crush, nothing more.  No need to question further.    School was very boring today.  I missed you Eaner!  No Eaner to brighten me up at the end of the day.  I needed that too.  Being sick and going to school are not two things that go together.  But alas I assume I'll be there again tomorrow infecting the rest of the student body.  Because, frankly, if I have to be miserable with a cold others should have to be too.    I'm on break form my history homework.  Yes, Kate, my homework consists of notes.  I hate it when she hears about that starts to laugh like it's funny.  I don't laugh at her homework now do I?  No!  So leave me alone!  Okay so I have issues, I know.  Doesn't everybody though?    huh...maybe if I think of something profound to say b4 the night is over I'll pop back on but otherwise...until next time!
