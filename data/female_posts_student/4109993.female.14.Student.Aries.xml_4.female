To all that we have I think of all the mistakes. All the mistakes that I could have stopped. And all the fights I could of stopped. Now things have gone too far, Too far, to change. Tears fill my eyes... Another night left to cry. My heart is filled with pain, `Cause I know nothing will ever be the same. Our lives are a mess, Now everything is lost Now your heart is breaking, because of me. Again because of me What is this thing we call, love is it meant to hurt? Is it meant to feel like this? Someone please tell me, is it?    ~Shadowlurk~ Cold tears Running down my blood covered face All I can do is run, run away from your, Living memory... Run away from life As far as I run, the problems, the pain, Follows me. A cold tear falls upon my stomach, awakening me to the reality of being, A victim of heartbreak Everyone knew how strongly I felt of you How you astounded me with your each word, Your soul, the most amazing soul that will ever, Roam this earth. You had the most incredible, wild, Imagination. One of the most precious people in my life, The sweetest flower, In the garden of life.     ~Lonewolf~ Destitute No more words. Emotions too strong for words to encompass, are draining my soul tonight. Loss undermines me Pain overtakes me. I fear to love - and love again. I'm scared to want - and yet I want her. No more, I beg. Please let it end. For fear of losing, I cannot win! Shall my heart be as granite? The hope of love be banished? I cannot resign myself to loneliness The fairy-tale awaits So I choose to believe. Yet a doubt lingers... Once love is lost too many times It's relegated to verse and rhymes, Existing for some, But not all For some appears a bridge, For me a wall No more words. Emotions too strong for words to encompass Drain my soul Leaving me destitute.    ~Shadowlurk~ I feel just so cimmerian, Forever trapped in this unenlightening world I collapse down onto the icy path, Watching other couples pass Being so far away from you is like god damn enslavement People stare at me, as though I am insane Lost inside my state of confusion, They cannot feel this suppressing sting... The happy times we had together, feels like an fantasy Why is it that, I cannot stop thinking of you? Why do your words and thoughts, effect me so? I hate it that our love feels illegal When it's the one thing that is real and pure Now suicidal thoughts are surrounding me, My misery is the result of you Each time I let it be known, that I love you I have to sacrifice my self-esteem I get trampled on and am left in a weeping pile.. . And now I really don't want to see, See another day. Because Iâ€™m feeling so alone Looking back, pains me but, I am afraid to look forward.. This is for you, from me These are my final words I love you. And that's why I can no longer be.
