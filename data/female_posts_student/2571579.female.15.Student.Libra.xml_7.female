But Lets go back to at least last night. I went to the movies with him, eileen, carissa, and matt. We saw Catwoman. I thought it was good even though i couldnt sit still and randomly would rock my chair or meow at the screen for no reason. Simko got a little agrivated lol .. after the movie we decided to be different and go out the side exit. So i kicked the door ..labeled 'emergency exit' open and we walked along a white hallway. Or we can say i tried bouncing off the walls. I was a little bit hyper haha But that was fun. .. Afterme and eileen slept over carissa's. There were many good times right there. We hung out for a while and then tie-dyed shirts at 3:30ish at night. We kind of got the dye on our bodies and it is tricky to get off haha .. it was down my leg and on my foot. After that we watched "i love the 90's' .. good show. Even tho i dont watch TV i do have to say that would be worth watching. Eileen fell asleep really early so i was thinking we should do something to her. What a good friend i know lol. We decided that toothpaste was a good choice and i started putting it on her face. She half woke up and just smeared it and made it worse. Then we took two pics of me standing over her with the empty toothpaste container. I was going to take the last one on the roll with carissa in it even tho she had nothing to do with it really. As i was putting the flash on she woke up entirly so i snapped it and she was like 'uhhhh?' and then she had to get it off her face. She didn't really laugh with us but she wasnt mad or anything. I think she'll laugh once she see's the pics tho haha i cant wait! But then she went back to bed and me and carissa watched more "i love the 90's' and sang the song 'uhhhh uhhhh nananana nana nana' and 'mmm mmmm mmm' haha classics of '94 i beleive. Then we watched animal planet for a while and then just talked. As it was starting to get light out we realized it was like 6:30 so we eventually went to bed. That night .. I guess you would say.. was 'Simba's' party. It was good. Jess and Sara were there.. and Ken .. and other people i didn't know but they were all pretty cool. Then i got into a few pillow fights and then an Axefight with Ken. Needeless to say.. i lost and reek of it right now. It smells great just not on me .. and not this much haha. Tomorrow I'm going toa Philles game in the new stadium so i guess that will be fun.. I'm not sure. I have other stories like how i almost got me and some people killed after the movie by bangging on someone's car. And another time with simko when we flipped people in a gang off and they came back and got outta their car to talk shit. But we're not gonna get to deep into all that right now.       I've decided i REALLY have to make the best of this week because i leave Saturday for camp and then vaca and all. I'm not even sure i'f ill get to sleep outside on my trampoline or in the woods before all that because i have work =\ Hopefully after vaca ill be able to do Lotsss of fun stuff but that's what happened last year. You start cramming things to make the best of your time away from school. But whatever.. i gotta be up early tomorrow so ill update about that.        David Bowie- Ziggy Stardust  "..so we bitched about his band and should we crush his sweet hands"
