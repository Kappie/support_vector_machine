       
      Going to school without my computer for the second time.  The first time it didn't help me too much, but then there were people I knew around to distract me.  So today should be better, since everyone else is involved in Superbowl prep, and I will be watching the game all alone (sigh), so there is nothing to prepare for.  Go Pats!
