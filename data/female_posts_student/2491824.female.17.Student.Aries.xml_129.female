Read at your own risk.  ...You have been warned... ......If you keep reading you won't be able to turn back... ....Are you sure? ......Are you sure that you're sure? .....Really?... Well, ok, here goes....   On the way down to Charleston, we were listening to various CDs...  One we listened to was my Third Eye Blind CD (their self-titled one). ...That is one on my favorite CDs... It just reminds me of happy, carefree summers.. Ah, good times... (Then later we listened to Dashboard Confessional, which didn't really help...) Anyway, I also made me think of Matt.. And how happy we were; well, how happy I was and how happy he pretended to be and how happy he told me he was... *sigh* ...And how suddenly he just broke up with me..  I still don't understand that.  He was like 'I'm happy with 'us'!'...'I love you so much!'.... And he was talking about after we graduate from high school--which was 2 years away at the time-- that he wanted to take me to Florida so we could go to Universal Studios and go to some beaches and do 'romantic' things like that...  Then about two weeks after the idea to go to Florida, he basically broke up with me...  (Read  here  and  here  for more info. NOTE: Hindsight is 20/20. And what I wrote there is very flawed. ..Then read  this .) ...It's crap, right?   I think I just need some closure...  The last time I talked to him was when I called him (see the second link above)...  Also... Sadly, I'm pretty sure that I am becoming desperate for a boyfriend, just for the sake of having one... I know that's what is bringing on these thoughts... ...But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I should just forget about him.. We disagree on religious and political issues that I am very adamant on...  ...But also, we have almost the exact same sense of humor, and anyone who knows me at all knows humor is a biggie for me... We both have very diverse musical tastes. ...He's one of the few guys I know that will be grooving to a Skankin' Pickle song one minute, then doing a line dance to a Rascal Flatts song the next. (...Hot damn, I love 4-H boys!...) But, it's just confusing... Why did he break up so suddenly and unexpectedly? ...Bah...   I'm pathetic...   I'm sorry if you actually read that.. . I kind of lost my train of thought in the middle of it, so I apologize if it didn't make much sense...    ....  §®ægådørë®§¤ says: hahhahahhahahhaahahhahaahhahahha Ashly's drunk  AshyAsh says: damn you!  AshyAsh says: i'm just dumb!    Oh! Another random thing... G says our fall and spring shows will both be musicals next year to get grant money. (In the fall a girls' musical, and in the spring a guys' musical.) Know what this means... My senior year, the best part that I can hope for is an extra, or maaayabe a walk-on...      ...C'est la vie...
