Sometimes I need to be made aware of the mistakes I make so I can learn from my actions. The support I receive from you readers helps drive me to share my experiences with all of you.   ~Thank you   Today I would like to retract a statement I made a while back about not having my friends there to support me when I needed it. A Few days back I sat down and wrote a very lovely letter to a good friend of Jesse and mine named Patricia. I have known her off and on for the last couple of years but only through association from an online support group for BBW.  I didn’t actually really get to know her until right around receiving the news of Jesse’s deployment. She has made it a point to message me every day just to ask me how my day is going and she keeps me company when she see that Jesse isn’t online talking to me. She also does the same for him whenever he is online and I am not. We have become very close and Jesse and I plan to make a trip out to her hometown when he comes back from Kuwait for good. I am forever grateful for the fact that she is a part of our life and extension to our family and look forward to the day of finally meeting her face to face and Jesse and I giving her a hug sandwich.        In FRG News:  I have been asked to work on the newsletter for the FRG. At first I was a little reluctant to do so but I figure it can give me something to do to pass the time away and also get me more involved with the FRG. I love to write and I hope that even if this is a temporary thing, my efforts are appreciated. I am also the (un-official) Photo-historian. This is a position that was made up at the last minute. My duties will include taking photos of all of the FRG events and compiling them in a library of sorts so that they are available for anyone to view (for example, soldiers of the 319th, the higher ups, or even family and friends of the 319th soldiers). I can also incorporate these images into the newsletter as well, which will give those who receive it a chance to see what our events tend to look like.
