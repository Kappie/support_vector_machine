Got my bottom braces off so that's cool. I said a funny thing to Debra before, I told her "Imagine saying that you went to the dentist and saying you got your bottoms taken off?" It was funnier when I told her. I'm so worried about finals. My face is breaking out so bad, and I have to take senior picture retakes cause mine are SOOOOOOO bad. Like... really, really bad.... I can't wait for summer. I just want all these finals to be over and summer to start and to live on the beach. That would be good. That would be very good. Become a beach bum. I just wanna pass my Regents. Get them all over with. Ug... thats a good word to describe my mood... ug. x0x
