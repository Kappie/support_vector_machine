It makes me so angry that people attack others based on two facts they know...the fact that they've never met the person and are talking behind their backs just don't seem to matter anymore.   Whatever happened to decency?  Have we just decided to all attack the innocents without evaluating ourselves?  Are any of us appointed to be the judges of souls?  Do we believe that as mere human beings, we have that sort of divinity?  Think about things very carefully before you say them.  Think about the way they impact others, and also think of yourself.    When true judgement comes, let us not be condemned for our hypocrisy.
