I`m not going to type much cause this keyboard is completely weird, but I`ll type as much as possible.  Having fun at school, Scott?  Josh, WHY DIDN`T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE SICK?!  Have fun writing your paper-thingy.  I don`t know if I`ll be able to update.  We leave here in about 2 days and then its off to Toulon and Venice.    btw, that was witnessing and dogs are ALWAYS better than cats.
