I have a lot of things going on right now, with it being the end of the year. This summer is going to be so much fun! Weddings, Maine, Family, SUN, VACATION! :D  You don't know what you got until it's gone!  I'm talking to a guy online who I used to be practically in love with and now... I CAN HARDLY STAND HIM!! But it's all good, it's about time. He's not very nice. Well actually he's a sweetie but a little two-faced! Graarw :S Dunno.  It's getting better all the time.   I love music, it's my escape, that and something (or one) else, but we don't need to go into that. later
