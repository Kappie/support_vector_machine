Had a guest service at church tonight and I took my flatmate Lisa.  Was quite accessible and interesting, but um... I actually disagreed with quite a lot of what the speaker said.  Well not necessarily disagreed but just don’t think he gave the full picture.  He painted everything in a rather rosy light, like if you become a Christian life will be perfect, everything will be wonderful and you will never have any problems ever again.  He was talking about how people have a need, a longing for something more than us.  No matter how much material wealth we have it will not make us happy. Ok so far. Then he said how God fills that space, how Jesus comes in and makes us complete and we will never be lonely again.   Um…   Then he said that if we have accepted the gift God is offering us, then his spirit will come and live in us and we will know the truth and we will realise and understand our worth, our identity, how much he loves us and everything. So does that mean that if we don’t realise those things, don’t understand them, don’t believe them, we have really accepted God?  We don’t really believe?    Then Lisa was asking me some questions about how do we know Jesus was the Son of God, not just a mad man, and I couldn’t answer properly. What if I never really believed? What if I didn’t accept the gift God was offering?    He said that it is like a broken computer. We try and press different buttons, fiddle with various wires, but nothing works because it is not plugged into the wall.  It is not attached to the power supply.  He said it was the same as life and Christianity.  We try and fiddle with things, fill our lives with stuff, but nothing will work unless we are ‘plugged in’.  Maybe that’s my problem – maybe I’ve got a dodgy connection.  Don’t feel really crap about this because know that he did just paint a rosy picture and there are loads of people who still feel lonely, doubt God’s love for them. But still has made me question stuff.
