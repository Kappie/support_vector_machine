IthinkI am finally over Devan , well I still have feelings4 him and probably allways will but it doesn't hurt to talk to him or be around him anymoreinfact I really like just being friends w/ him. But I cant help feeling that he doesn't want 2 befriends w/ me like I feel like I am bothering him. I think if I was he would show it or tell me. But I think if I was bugging him he wouldn't have asked me 2 go 2 his basketball games so hopefully someday we will be something more than friends again.
