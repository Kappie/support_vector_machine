The rest of my family has decided to desert me. So have my friends. They all eat poo anyway.  I haven't seen Steph all day, I miss her. *Waves hands wildly* I love you Steph, come back! I wonder where she is anyway. Maybe I'll call her later. Alice said she spent the entire day crying her eyes out, God knows what's happened now.  My parents left for dinner an hour ago, they left me without food. I don't care if I'm perfectly capable of making my own food, its just bad manners.  I'm so tired and hungry. See ya later...
