Cause 1) Rosie is practically fluent and 2) Latin is a dead language, sorry to say.  Don't get me on that one.  I'm just teasing.  Ahhh...well, I'm much better about the whole Michael thing.  Abby's got Godiva ice cream for me, so I've got to go eat it sometime this week.  It'd be awful to let it go to waste.  So don't be too mean to him anymore.  Josh, you can still "reason" with him if you're not too busy doing your usual nothing.  But, anyway...so, so-so, so-so-so. (Abby will get that one.)  Right. I'm getting off of here.  Choir at 5:30.  Yay.  You can see the excitement written on my face and the sarcasm dripping out of every word in this sentence.  OK, I'm out of here.
