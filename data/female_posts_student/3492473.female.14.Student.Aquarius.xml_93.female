I'm just a few months older than her so in reality, we're  really close.  I was telling her how I was confused about stuff and we were talking about it. She said she had to go but for me to call her. I was like OMG! Yes! My mom doesn't want me to see or talk to my my dad's side of the family other than three of my cousins who I'm also super close with. So my mom has no idea I hung out w/ Katie and other members of my family. I was extremely happy to talk to her though. We were discussing my problems, talking about our grandma moving up to Ohio, our sports, music, boys, Ashlee Simpson! LoL, it's so amazing.  We're really alike.  She loves Ashlee Simpson too. But it's also kinda depressing. I just found out her sister so my cousin,  Jen is engaged!  It's just like...wow. She's the first kid of the family to get married so I guess it's pretty big for us all. Katie was talking about going dress shopping with Jen and Meghan (other sister/cousin) today and  how she wished I could go with them.  Yeah, I wish I could too. It's so hard lying to my mom about this all but I mean, it's for the best. My mom wouldn't allow me to see them if she knew so the only way I can see my family  is to lie.  Don't get me wrong.  I hate doing it.  And it's not the easiest thing in the world. It's quite difficult because  my mom always knows everything.  Anyways, that made me cheery. So then I went online and talked to people til 2ish. I went to bed by 3 am and woke up around 9ish to get ready to go to my Grandpa's. So I ate, got ready, and we left to go get Kevin. Eddie and Kevin painted. And guess what I did?!  I WASHED MY GRANDPA'S CAR ALL BY MYSELF!  He asked me to clean his back window because he couldn't see out of it and I realized the car was really dirty so I offered to wash it. At first he said it'd be too much work but Eddie just pulled the car out of the garage and I started.  I've never done that before.  So it was cool. I got really dirty and wet but it was all good. He paid me in the end so that's always nice. My grandpa is  loaded . Like seriously. He retired from GE before I was born and still gets paid!!! A good amount too! So then we left to go home. I tried to read some Tom Sawyer but I went online. Then I read some more Tom Sawyer and ended up falling asleep on the couch. During this time,  my mom took pictures of me  so I can't wait to see those. Once I woke up, I went back online for a minute and went to read some more. I wouldn't say Tom Sawyer is good but I think it's funny. Just like the stuff that happens.  So I'm liking this book so far.  It's sure as hell better than LOTF.  A lot  better. Then I ate dinner. Recently, my sister and mom have been using  sexual references  to talk about things and I've been thinking, "Oh lord..." So tonight at dinner it was no different. But this time we started talking about their first times and everything and let's just say it was a little  too  much. My sister said something as I was chewing my salad and I started choking! I couldn't stop laughing and then I started crying because it was so funny. Oh well. My family is out there! But I love them despite it all. And now I'm here. I just wanted to clue you guys in on stuff! ; ) So now I'm gonna go watch a DVD so talk to you guys later. By the way, 21 days/3 weeks, until school starts... good or bad?  Mixture. I'll explain later! muah~
