Lindsey, the only spelling i care about is people's names, it's like calling me "weel" instead of will. the worst sound to a person's ears is their name said wrong, its the same with typing.  (by the way, the translation of this paragraph is it's fine when i do it but when someone else, especially Rosie, does it, its all wrong)
