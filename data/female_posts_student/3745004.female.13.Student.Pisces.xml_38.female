Someone was intruding upon his white haze..  his  reality. It blurred, before finally snapping into focus. He was back in the tavern.. he was back in the tavern, and he could hear Kaiuri's words. In disbelief he centered his gaze on the girl who had stuck her face in front of his. He just gaped at her, like he could not comprehend what she was saying. Uselessly his jaw worked up and down, no sound coming forth from his throat. Then he frowned, an angry look coming into his eyes. She was trying to take away  all  of his past... she was trying to wrench his  name  from him.  He would not let her!  "I am Sasuke.." he began, stopped dead by her words. ' I killed you. I ran you through with one of your own guard's weapons! ' "No, I can't have, you don't know.." ' You died that day. I watched your blood spill out like a waterfall cascading over the edge of a cliff. ' "That's not, there's no way.." But hadn't he awoken in a pool of blood, his own? No, it couldn't.. ' I watched you die. ' "You didn't.." ' I watched you take your last, shuddering breath of life. ' It can't have been.. ' I was there, you cannot trick me. I know you're not him. You're not Sasuke.. ' These words, and the rest, echoed in his skull haphazardly, each as if a separate voice shouting at him. "No, no, no...!" His forehead was touched by her hand. ' You are dead and I am alive! ' All her words between when she touched the spot where her kiss had landed years ago and when she declared that he was dead, had disappeared like the middle of his life. Just clouded by that white haze. Even before Kaiuri had finished condemning him to hell Sasuke was on his feet, the stool he had been sitting on knocked over in his anger. "Shut up!" he burst out almost childishly. Normally his shoulders were hunched, as if Sasuke just wanted to go unnoticed. But now, in all his fury, he was at his full six feet and eight inches, towering over Kai. "Just shut up! You don't know, you can't, I'm not dead! Can't you see? I'm not dead! You never killed me, I don't even  know  you! I don't know anyone, I don't.." his voice was dissolving into helplessness. "I'm not dead, I can't be, I can't.. I can't!"  But hadn't he awoken in puddle of blood..? Didn't this girl's presence cause him to fade into the white haze again? But he wasn't dead... was he?
