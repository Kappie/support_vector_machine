(HERES THE ENTY WORD FOR WORD. STREIGHT FROM THE PAGES) (THIS ENTRY WASN'T DATED AT THE TIME)  i hate being here. i hate crying. i hate her. its all my fault. why the computer broke. why my brother was born. why we have to live in this dump. everything. i f i wasn't born none of this would have happened. if i wasn't born, she wouldn't hate me. i cant even wish i was dead because that would only make me out to be an even bigger burden. the ony thing that would matter is that she now had to pay for my funeral. i hate being a huge disappointment. god i hate to open my eyes because all that i see is all the things that ive done to be an even bigger disappointment and i cant close them because it doesn't go away. thats all she sees and now i understand. there's no reason to be here. there's no purpose to my living. i'll never be what i was meant to be. i''ll just be more of a failure. thats all that peple see of me, a big failure. to life. she wonders why i cant tell her things. because this is what happens. she makes me feel like an even bigger failure because thats all she see of me. i feel so stupid for even feeling that i should be greatful to her for all the things we've been through and getting us out of them because what it really boils to, al throughout the situation all she was thinking about was how if i wasn't here, if we weren't here (my brohter and I), then it all wouldn't have gone that way. all throughout my life, i can be summed up to be  ONE BIG REGRET.     well that is the entry. heres another one from a different day. backround info about this is that i wouldn't wake up to do the dishes so she got mad. and called me ungreatful and said other things i dont feel like repeating.  (HERES THE ENTY WORD FOR WORD. STREIGHT FROM THE PAGES)  August 16,2004  God,my moms a miserable bitch. i sware. she thinks of everyway to make my life unbearing. she's like let me show you how its like for a mother to not care. ALREADY KNOW. let me show you what its like for me to have already eaten and not care whether you do or dont. ALREADY KNOW THAT TOO. let me show you what its like for a mother to not care whether you live or die. KNOW THAT TOO. something must have happened during her childhood to make her so evil. to make her wish that she had no children. it should be a law to keep unwanted children. ABORTION. i'm sure they had that in her day. then i owuldn't have to deal with her no. i dont know why they let ppl who hate children have children themselves. who care more about their crusty 40 y/o boyfriends then their own children. her whole life is revolved around verbal abuse and making her children feel horrible about themselves. i wouldn't have such a horrible image about myself is it wasn't for her. she thinks that because she's "here" makes her a good parent. because she works hard makes her an even better parent. and that the fact that probably only 3 times a month she spends with er children and everyother day she spends yelling and shaping their minds with bad thoughts about themselves. she rather brong a plant or a foster child home to love then her own children. its funny how once she's sick of you she can just get something else to take your place. for me it was Rah-Rah. but poor Rah-Rah got replaced with a plant. see how she thinks of us. and now that the plants have brought those bug things, now she's not gonna xcare for them and she'll probably through them away.funny,huh. if only she can do that to people.then mabey her life wouldn't be such a shit hole. ha. thats probably what she thinks about every day when she wakes up to torture us.  wll thats both of the entries. obviously i was mad during both. but i belive that when mad you say alot of things you mean or you feel that you try to stear away from when your happy.anyway. i wasn't completly sad during my time away. i was frustrated abnd mad.lol. just kidding. i was happy sometimes. but a few days ago i found myself thinking about things...
