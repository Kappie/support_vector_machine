Every step I take I fall back three  I never get it right I guess it wasn’t meant to be  I wanna be like you I wanna serve you  But I feel I can’t Its just so hard.  I try I get up again  But then I fall Fall back down.   Theres nothing good in me Its all you.  This life this heart I give it up  Please, do somethign good with it   I am stuck in this whirl wind  Or should I call it  atronado.  It never stops. It just keeps swirling around  round and round   I’m ina prison without bars I can’t escape  I try but the force is to strong  I want to be loved I wanna be held
