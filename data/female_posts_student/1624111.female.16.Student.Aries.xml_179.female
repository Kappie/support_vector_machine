In honor of my acceptance as in integral part of the Catholic Community. with a capital C. ha...something like that.       yeah, so i got confirmed today. It was fun. The bishop was nice. Not some old fogey like i expected. He  did  have a shiny gold ring on his pinky though...which made me think of Luther and Catholic Church monetary power abuses and all that reformation/euro stuff. But he was still nice. So maybe he deserved his ring. And he wore a cool red robe that looked like id be fun to wear. and his pointy bishops hat. ha. And...lets see... i got to do the big important job of lighting my row's candles. stupid open door almost blowing out my candle. And...Father Ron had to tell me to blow out my candle when the bishop started to come over to talk to me cause i was confused because i thought i had to blow it out but i looked around and no one else was blowing their out and i turned to Michele and i was like "am i supposed to blow this out?" and shes like "i dunno" so i didnt and then...he whispered "you can blow out the candle"... so i did. and...yeah. damn being first. oh well. got it over with quickly. And i got annointed with some fancy oil on my forehead. its still there, actually. mmm, fancy oil. holy oil, actually.      and...mmm...it was funny when my aunt/sponsor Libby confessed that she could only say the Hail Mary in spanish because it was just like automatic and it was weird and took thinking-through to start saying it in english. Apparently she prays all prayers only in spanish except the Our Father which she forced herself to learn in English. haha. funny to me. Crazy Spanish.       And i got 2 new rosaries. and a watch. and a book. and some jewelry. and...a keychain? i dunno, its not important what i got.       And i saw laurie there with Eric! aw, that was so cute. haha. You think Eric would go to Emilys confirmation if she was getting confirmed this year? i dunno. It'd be weird to have my boyfriend there with my parents and grandparents and all... i guess itd be weird to have a boyfriend in the first place. i cant imagine so many things related to that.      And im really tired and i soooo dont want to go work on our chem project tomorrow and i soooo dont want to do all the million pieces of homework i have. like those 2 essays. arg. i should force myself to do at least one of them this weekend. maybe the spanish one? oh, bah. well see. i wonder if i ever took my english stuff home? i hope so.       And i hope i get to do something with Emily next weekend or at least talk to her on the phone for a while. Then again, when am i not hoping to talk to her? Gosh...i could talk to that girl for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and days... and not get sick of it. Thats why id be perfect to take her to Tucson! but...alas.      Maybe that should be my goal this summer... to see if i can ever get sick of her. When ive talked to her so much im tired of it...then...ironicly...i can celebrate. With party hats and streamers and cake and everything. Minifiesta. And there will be much love. and happiness. abound.      I'm such a loser. I need a life. This is my life? this is what i write about on my blog? ha... im so weird. oh well... ill blame it on chemicals. Seeing emily engouh and talking to her often enough stabilizes some sort of chemical balance in my brain. Without that contact--> imbalance---> :'(. Damned chemicals.  right.  actually...f**k chemicals...love isnt chemicals! i refuse! my soul loves her soul. ha. eat that, science. *does show-off-y dance with fingers and girations*  anyway...  im going to bed. Goodnight, world. Goodnight, God. Goodnight, Emily. Goodnight, everyone who wishes i would individually mention them, because they probably deserve it for one reason or another but im a jerk and only mention Emily cause i like to think she's "special". Goodnight.
