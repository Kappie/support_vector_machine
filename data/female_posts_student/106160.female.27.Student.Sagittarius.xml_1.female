I completed the two ankle length skirts I was making for everyday wear and also my first EGL dress (EGL=Elegant Gothic Lolita to those unfamiliar with such). The digicam battery has finally died permanently (it had been holding a charge long enough to snap a handful of pics) so I can't take pics until we get a new one in a couple of weeks since it has to be ordered online. The dress isn't super short or super poufy but with the petticoat underneath...oi. I feel so girly (if it were all-white, I'd feel like a wedding cupcake). I started on the headpiece this morning but I cut my thumb a few minutes ago trying to use packing tape (the self-dispensing type) so I probably won't finish it until later this week. I made the dress using the same pattern I used for my Alice cosplay dress, I just shortened the hem and made the sleeves puffier. The dress is made with a lightweight black brocade-type fabric and has a faux corset panel of ribbon lacing up the front (am repeating the lacing look on the headpiece). I trimmed the hem, sleeves, and neckline with a soft and slightly stretchy lace and also used it around the faux corset panel. I think I might add a little more lace on the "skirt" portion though I'm not sure yet. The petticoat is one I won a couple of years ago on Gothic Auctions for just $5. It's white  has three tiers of netting. I haven't decided about bloomers yet since the dress isn't short enough to require them but if I *do* make some, they will definitely be black. Now I just have to make (or buy) myself some cute ringlet extensions to cover my pigtails. ^^;; I've already got an idea of what my next dress will look like and I believe I will go with a deep red or burgundy fabric with cream or black lace and go with a more EGA design. If it turns out well, it will probably be the one I wear to the EGL panel/tea party @ AWA. I think I'll use my generous scraps and make matching dresses for Absinthia (my SD)...hehe.
