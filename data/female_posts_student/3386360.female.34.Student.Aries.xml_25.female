He didnt feel like going in today. Excuse me ? Rent free, food free and you dont feel like going in so you can keep your job so you can move the fuck out ? On top of everything he tells me that if his "girlfriend" or "ex" (in front of Niki) calls again to tell her to "die".. excuse me ?? He sat and wrote to her that he didnt want to lose her and that he wanted to work things out with her and he's doing this shit ?? gods.. I get so tired of men like that. I see him as the player he is and I just want to walk away from everything. I see that if he got his head out of his butt he would be a great guy but.. sigh...   150 - 175 worth of food, most of it stupid things like mini frozen pizza's, big bags of chips, cakes, pies.. is all that he and Matt (Not going on Matt now because he's been gone) have brought into the house in the last what almost 4 months? give or take.. And Dave eats breakfast, lunch and dinner here.. *shakes head* This is a good lesson to me to NOT allow people in anymore without strict guildlines and NO MORE USERS..   oh well I hope he gets his life straightened out. His main priorities are drinking, smoking pot and parting with friends and now this new girl who I wish he had stayed with Crystal she at least had some class.
