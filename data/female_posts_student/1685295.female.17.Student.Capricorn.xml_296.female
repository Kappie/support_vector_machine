Of course, there's absolutely no way he's gonna win...too idealistic.  Too much of that, "all the world need is love" and "why can't we all be friends."  And he's a vegan.  I think what I'm trying to say is that he's a one man hippie revolution.  Still doesn't mean that I don't like him though, in fact, I like him more than any of the other candidates.    Oh, and another exciting fact of today...I HAVE HOT WATER!!!!!!!!  YAY!!  I have been going without it since friday morning!  And with the college interview on saturday, it was just hell trying to bath with cold cold water!  It hurt my head.  It was kind of like brain freeze, except not.  Then I finally had to boil water to bath.  But it still wasn't fun.  Not fun at all.
