I love it when they do "Holding Out For A Hero" at the end, I want the soundtrack... although in fact I *do* have the original version by Bonnie Tyler, which I'm listening 2 right now... Not many cds our family doesn't have between us!!  Puss In Boots is so damn cool, I love Antonio Banderas (and his wonderful voice) anyway, and tis a marvellous part! Just a pity he has 2 be an animated cat instead of his usual self *sigh* hehe!! But the cat is *great*!  Wearing my new top, tis ver' nice if a bit over-revealing, methinks for home use only! Got 2 start reading "The Poisonwood Bible"....  Can't seem 2 sleep anymore, tis ver' bizarre.... Ah well, *such is life*. Was up til 5am this morning, tis nicht so gut. /Me yawns!  Ever heard Genesis? No probably not... /damn my varied and unrecognised musical tastes!!  Damn this infernal icecream, etcetera, my diet has flown away on the wind... ah screw it.  Bttr go ... purely because i can't think of anything to say   [first time this has ever occurred in my lifetime]
