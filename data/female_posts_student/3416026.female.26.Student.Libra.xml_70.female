When I took the puppy out for a walk this afternoon, first I saw a guy slicing a pipe in half with some sort of circular saw.  Sparks were shooting everywhere, and he was not only wearing a tank top and no gloves, but also no goggles.  Not even regular glasses, or shades or anything.    After I finished marvelling over that, a man walked toward me and stopped about 10 feet away. He had two rubber balls in his hand.  He dropped each of them, let them bounce once, then caught them and kept walking.  Someone must be selling pro-Texas tee-shirts somewheres on 7th ave because I saw two women (separately) wearing "Don't Mess with Texas ... WOMEN" shirts.  Then I saw a third person wearing one that said "Texas Is Way Better Than France" or something to that effect.  I liked it because two of my friends are Texans and my dad is sort of from there.  Then I saw a Park Slope teenage boy (which you may  urlLink remember  is of a  urlLink specific variety ) wearing a shirt that said  urlLink KEEP MUSIC EVIL .  That reminds me of "1992's New Face of Rock," my old buddy  urlLink Kurt Cobain  and his wordy message.  Anyhow, last was a six-year-old asking his mom about the 5,000 people passing out flyers on 7th ave.:  "But WHY do they DO that?"  Indeed.
