I will go to bat for someone as long as they dont lie to me or steal from me. Well there was quiet a delima not long ago that has finally come to a head even after all my pleaing to stop... T. a 22 year old sex offender begun to live with a family who allowed him to sleep in the same room and bed as their 14 year old daughter. When she became pregnant the parents blamed "him" but still did not do anything about it except ask him to leave. This is where I came in. They asked me C. please let him stay with you, we want him involved with the baby we just dont want him here. Come to find out the reason why is because THEY would go to jail if the cops found him in the house due to the pregnancy. So of course I allow it. It helped me also to get back on my feet from another disaster of "save the world" I agreed to give him a few weeks to get his life together and get into his own place. There were rules. No lying PERIOD, no stealing PERIOD. Then I begun to see how they were treating him and my heart begun to feel for the guy. I dug a bit into his record and found the sex offense was a rape when he broke into a place but the DNA didnt match him but he still went away. So I thought ok lets give him the benifit of the doubt. The parents were "friends" one moment and "enemies" the next. There were so many times (enough I lost count) where one moment he could talk to the girl the next he wasnt allowed near her then it was ok then it wasnt. To the point where I finally said "You cant speak to her again on my phone". So what happens. On one of the "good" days with the parents (I should say mother the step father has been rather consistant with no contact) they go out of town and she calls, he calls her back without me knowing it and then he tells me he is going to go for a walk. Out the door he goes. A few hours later I get a phone call from the mother. He's with the girl and this time she has had it and is going to call the cops. I can not say I blame her. He went over without permission, lied to me, lied to everyone. Then come to find out he's been attempting to get a 15 year old girl in bed with him online, along with a few other things. After having spoken with some people and after having done some research myself (I am a registered counselor)I have now allowed the blinders to come off and see him for the predator he is. I am sorry he has turned out this way, I am sorry his life will be over at such a tender age but to know what I know and to realize that he will never stop praying on children I realize that the safest place for everyone is for him to be behind bars.
