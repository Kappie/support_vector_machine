Quentin Tarantino has done the remarkable, he's created three great films- the sublime  Vol. 1 , the moving, slyly funny  Vol. 2  and the dizzying masterpiece of the entire  Kill Bill  saga.  The genius of Vol. 1 (and where I feel most critics missed the boat) was in the giddiness Tarantino radiated from behind the scenes.  You couldn't watch the scenes at the House of Blue Leaves without imagining him behind the camera going "This is so cool".  But Tarantino isn't going to repeat himself, or cheat the audience to pay for the same movie twice, so he switches gears, giving The Bride, the storyline and respect she deserves.  Where  Kill Bill  is ultimately a rumination on domestic squabbling,  Vol. 1  was the flashy, juicy argument and  Vol. 2  is the thoughtful understanding of what went wrong and what happens next.  That's not to say  Vol. 2  isn't loaded with those trademark Tarantino scenes where his sparkling dialogue causes the audience to grin from ear to ear, but  Vol. 2  doesn't want to just entertain you, it wants to show the affect the atmosphere, established in  Vol. 1 , has on the character.  "That woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die" Michael Madsen, in the performance of his career, tells his brother Bill.  "But then again, so does she."  Madsen, in a beer stained sluggishness, is a man who's been slowly broken down by his sins, who's tired of killing but gets that thrill when forced to rise to the challenge.  Budd is the only viper who, like The Bride, has not overcome  his conscious, yet he's the only one she never speaks to.  Trailers have given the cinema two great fight sequences, the battle between Nic Cage and John Goodman in  Raising Arizona  and now the showdown between Elle and B.  The delicious scene, which was second to Bill in anticipation lives up to expectations, and is a testimate to the actresses physical prowess.  I understand your reaction to the final confrontation, but I think on a second examination (as I've had) you'll realize Tarantino gave us the perfect send off.  Too smart to redo or try to outdo  Vol. 1 's finale, Tarantino gives us his most twisted, layered act.  As Bill and The Bride go around and around, Tarantino does something remarkable, he simultaneously moves the story backward and forward.  The ride that got The Bride to that point was long (shot, raped, cut, beat up,slashed, kicked, buried alive, tortured under Pai Mei) and  Vol. 2  pays off with an emotional understanding of the journey.  Perhaps the best scene in both films is when  a never better Uma Thurman removes the truth serum dart from her kneecap.  Her hand quivers and you're unsure if she'll throw it or set it down.  The tension between her emotions, wanting to unleash her rage, and her training, which taught her to use her head and keep her cool is palpable.  Watching this woman battle her way through so much while knowing she could completely fall apart at any time is what made the ride thrilling.  Tarantino uses every weapon in his arsenal-dialogue, music, editing, cinematography, casting- to create a fascinating, emotionally rich odyssey.  In a few instances Tarantino seems to love his own words too much (Budd's dressing down at the topless bar could have been condensed) but this is a small quibble and an indulgence I'm willing to make to a filmmaker so in control of his facilities, so fearless and so utterly in love with movies.  It's Quentin's universe, and there's no other place I'd rather live.
