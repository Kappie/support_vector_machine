Yeah, he was in my english class but other than that I never really talked to him and stuff. It's sad though, to lose another life, he was a good kid. Quiet kid, lol "goofy". "SWEDISH PRIDE"  ONLY 15 MORE DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So I should keep this to myself And never let you know I could fall in love with you
