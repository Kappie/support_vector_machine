If I ever had a chance in hell again, I would date him because he's good for me. I'm never getting that chance again but ffs I would like it.  But when we go for coffee...I will watch my personality. I will not fiddle with stupid things like Sachin pointed out to me. He read me fucking well. Wow.  Hmmm...going for lunch now.  but...i must remember not to go into anything with expectations.
