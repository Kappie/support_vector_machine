Any way, this song, Semisonic - Secret Smile listen to it, it's good, any way it's going on about how 'you've got a secret smile' and don't you think that? Well I do, whatever's inside my head, all my thoughts are mine and no one will truely know your thoughts. I guess when it comes down to it, it's the last bit of privacy we have, and it's locked inside our head. Nothing can read or decifer the code of though. Geez, bit heavy there! Sorry, just a bit moral.... and crazy! ...It was Laura! Hehe, blame Laura for every thing great! Grrr... my ear keeps going and I say that 'I can turn it off' cause it I press it then I can't hear any thing and it shuts out every one's annoying fake laughing! Hallelujah!
