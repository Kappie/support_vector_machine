I am just tired of working hard and still not getting everything. It sucks. And next year is going to be even harder. I don't want to take calc 2, but I think my mom is going to make me. She is set on having me become valedictorian because she says she knows I want it. Yeah, I want it, but if I don't get it, then I will be ok. I just dont want to dissapoint her and my dad. But I also don't want to have an extremely hard senior year. Who honestly wants that? I don't know, I just need to talk to my parents and tell them how I'm feeling, because nothing is going to get resolved until I am honest with them. I'm in computer class right now...free days suck. Tommy is making me mad because he keeps looking up racist jokes. He thinks they are the funniest things....it's disgusting. I tried to give Martin the DVD today at break, but that didn't work out. Oh well, I tried to find him, then I quit. So then I put the DVD back into my locker, and then of course I find him. Yeah, I was too lazy to go back to my locker and get it, so I just didn't deal with it. Nice, huh? Oh well, it's not a big deal. I better not have that much homework tonight. The only homework I might have would be psychology or physics. I have physics homework that I should be doing right now, but I just don't feel like it. Damn, I so used to not be like this. What is happening to me? haha. No, it's not that important. I'll just lie to Mrs. Briley and tell her I was unable to finish it due to "family issues" and if she asks me to explain further, I'll look all sad, and be like "do I have to?" It works pretty good...I haven't used it in awhile tho. I might have to break it out today. I don't know if it's sad or not that I don't care if I lie to a teacher so I won't get in trouble. I know some people (Holli) would never do that because they would feel too guilty. Am I supposed to feel guilty? Do I have a cold heart? Am I asking too many questions that will never get answered? Yeah, I thought so too. Today is Monday...hmm...the last time I talked to Josh, I believe it was Thursday. Wow! That's a record! I don't know why I felt the need to state that. It's not like it's a thing where I have to talk to him all the time or I'll freak out. I only worry...haha. I suppose if I REALLY wanted to talk to him, I could always call him...I dunno. I've never been big on calling guys. (haha...Alex--I always make you call them whenever there is a situation in which I would need to call a guy....did that make sense?) Whoa...the weirdest feeling just came over me. I want to cry, but I don't know why. It's weird...hmmm....I'm highly confused over my state of mind right now. I want to cry....but why? Haha. That makes me sound like I am going crazy or something. I'm not. I've been typing a lot on this blog entry...I must be REALLY bored. WE still have like 20 minutes left of class....geez! I guess I won't be doing my physics work. I need to stop with this procrastinating....it's getting really old, fast. Now, I just really want to go home, and end the school day. I'm just not in the mood to be here right now. I'm not in a bad mood tho. I just don't want to be at school, that's all. Wow, to whoever reads this (prolly just Alex and Josh...haha), I am sorry for the extreme length of this boring entry. I think this is a good time to be ending this....so I shall do that just now.
