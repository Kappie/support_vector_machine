I'm not sure if they want naming, but it was a really moving speech and it made you think alot about self-harm and the damage it can do... So here it is...         "Teenagers all around the world are unhappy with their lives. Some more than others. Everyone has a different way of dealing with their problems, whether they are caused by family, friends or just life in general. If you ask a teenager ‘Are you happy with your life?’ what are the chances they will actually say yes? Even if a person looks happy and is always smiling, they might be hiding feelings from the world. We all know how much pressure we have on us. Many people cannot cope with this pressure and find ways to release it. And I’m sorry to say, that many teenagers nowadays, turn to drugs, abuse and self-harm.           However, even if a person does these things, they are still normal, they still have feelings. You should not hate them for being different. So... ok, they have a weird way of releasing their anger and stress, but would you rather they did these things or keep their feelings locked away inside? Adults try to get teenagers to talk to them, to tell them what is wrong. But, be honest here, if you mum was upsetting you in some way, would you tell here to her face, ‘Mum, you are the reason I’m upset all the time.’ Would you sit with her and talk about all your problems? I wouldn’t, and most of the people I know wouldn’t.           Self-harm isn’t all that bad. It is just a way of letting out pain and stress. By self-harming people are turning emotional pain, into physical pain. They are not trying to kill themselves or seeking for attention. I’m sure that you would not tell anyone if you were hurting yourself because of depression. You would try and hide it. But people don’t allow self-harmers to hide their scars. Rumours are spread; people are called weird by their best friends, even their family. Everyone ignores them, says they are seeking for attention, but they aren’t. They would much rather be treated normally, we all have feelings, and many of us know what its like to be bullied and have rumours spread about us. Treat others, as you would like to be treated. Isn’t that what we are always taught?           I don’t understand why everyone hates self-harmers. They are no different from anyone in this room, except they are full of pain inside. A pain that weighs them down, a pain that they cannot get rid of, a pain that is only made worse by their friends discarding them; leaving them on their own. It might make you feel better; make you feel stronger, as though you are better than your friend who needs your help now more than ever. Would you rather you felt good, than make someone who needs help happy? If you were asked you would say that you would help the person who is feeling down. But would you actually help them in real life? I know for a fact, that many of you wouldn’t.           There are other ways to release anger and stress. One of which is to write poetry. Many see this as a better option, but if your friends read your poems tell people what your write about; death, blood, suicide, hate, the same will happen. Many won’t like you; your friends will call you a ‘freak’ say you shouldn’t be allowed to see other people in case you ‘infect’ them. They call you names and say your poems should be reality. I can tell you now, that this will make people feel a greater pain inside, one that cannot be rid of by writing your feelings on paper. This is when people begin to turn to self-harm. For some the easiest way to rid yourself of pain and anger, is to cut it out."
