Having hardly any contact with fellow humans is quite tough and I do not enjoy it at all...especially being isolated from those few human I enjoy the most.  (Jessi's grounded)        I won 17 bucks playing cards....Im gonna miss the boys so much when the leave for school.  Our house is going to be boring unless we have some new guys to come play cards.  Any takers???? I cant wait till tomorrow....Im gonna hear all about Jessi's weekend, and since my life is completely boring...anything that happened will be enthralling! I think my life is turning around b/c things are different now, but the thing is...I cant tell anyone about it....:( thanks for reading
