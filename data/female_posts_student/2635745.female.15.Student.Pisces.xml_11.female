And also sanitary napkin is called that b/c apparently it is made of some of the same fibers that dinner napkins are made of.  INTERESTING!  I finished my aff.  WHOOPEE!  I am done.  Jake bugged me today, but he's not as irritating as he used to be.  He cracks me up.  I had a salad for dinner and rode our exercise bike for 30 minutes, I'm really fulfilling my new year's resolution.  YEAH for me! Buh Bye
