My results were unsurprising:  Lieberman - 100%, Bush - 98%, Kerry - 96%, Edwards - 90%, Clark - 89%, Dean - 88%, Sharpton - 87%, Kucinich - 66%.  If the Democrats were smart enough to nominate Lieberman, I'd vote for him in a second.  Don't know that I will vote for Bush, no matter who the guy running against him is.  I may have to go third party again, if it's between Kerry and Bush.  But we shall see.  It's a ways off, and a lot can happen before the end.
