And I feel compelled to compare last summer to this, because last summer was a painful, horrible time, and this year..it wasn't as bad.  Last summer: I started off with a wonderful loving boyfriend who I cared for muchos. We saw the Canada day fireworks together, even though my brother was with us. It was so super romantic. I wrote him a little cute book on the snuggle bunny (me) and her steamboat willy (him). We were madly in love, talked on the phone and on the computer for hours. He sent me the sweetest story about love, and I still have it to this day, I send it out to everyone around Valentines. Something I remember so vividly. I was having an incredibly shitty tuesday. He called me up, and talked with me until he had to go to work, then left. About...15 minutes later he showed up at my house. We spent the afternoon together, one of the best days I can remember. We made out at the top of my driveway. I still have a picture from that day. Towards the end of the month, he went up to his cabin in Sprout lake. It was hard being away from him, but his sister, who I was also friends with invited me over for a few nights. Willy came home for a day while I was still there and it was magical. I can remember going out to clean his mom's shop at one in the morning, and we sat out, under the stars, making out for what seemed ever and then some. Burnouts in his car, good night and good morning kisses. It was wonderful. Then he went back to the cabin, and everything was fine. And when he came back, I believe Aug 4, he broke up with me. Completely almost out of the blue. He then sent me harassing emails, blocked me, wouldn't talk to me. I was a lovesick mess of emotions. My best friend Liam was at camp, and I was alone with no one to talk to. Except for Alex. And Ash. Then Taylor came and spent the day with me and Fiona, and katie came too, and so did Alex. And it was great seeing Alex again, and I miss him muchlies. Then school started, and I was still pining for will.  This summer:  I spent July slumming around. Josie came to visit and stayed with me for almost a week, and started things with Tom. I told him I liked him. We went out. I was having a blast. I've liked this kid since I was in grade 4, it was like an honest dream come true. He went away to Seabeck.  And cheated on me. I didn't know tho. He came back, and we broke up. It was sad, but because I had been hanging around Lannie, I made new, older friends, some of whom I like more than friends. I've been tramping around, and hung out with my friends, water fights, argh, the works. I wish I talked to Alex. Making plans with Tom to totally sophisticate the world.  Or ourselves. Found out today he cheated on me. Feel betrayed slightly.  I still, no matter what, prefer this summer over last. The one good thing about last summer, was that I saw my Alex. And now that summer's over, I'm ready for winter, and conferences, and fun filled sex.   I heart you Adam, I'm sorry you're girlfriend is such an airhead.   Bring it on school....Gimme all you got. And a boyfriend. *eyes certain people*
