I feel so taken over with emotions right now that I can't even begin to sort them out and write them down. Love can only be understood if you experence it.  It is not like anything else, no other emotion and no other experence. I really love Paul with all my heart and my spirit. he is the best thing in my life. the person I get up for ever moring. The reason for me to live. I don't know how I am going to exist without him when he goes away to Gonzaga, even if it is for a few days. I will survive on the sould thought that he is coming back to me and that he loves me as much as I love him.
