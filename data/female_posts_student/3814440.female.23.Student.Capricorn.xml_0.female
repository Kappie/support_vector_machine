"She's one really smart girl. I can't believe she's like only 16. She's like my big sister. Actually better than my big sister. She rocks man."  Yeah, I could believe that. The hour I spent with her was enough to convince me that she wasn't your ordinary teenager.  So when I got home that Christmas break, I made sure to touch base with her.   [Hythiris] Hey there. Remember me?   [Sweething] Hmmm.. you sound familiar. *wink*   [Hythiris] Do I?   [Sweething] Hehehe, hey there Far!      She was still the same girl I met six months ago. That night, we chatted for hours. And when we logged off, I made her call me. And we talked some more.  Before I realised it, a week had passed. With us talking every single night.  Talking to her was like looking in the mirror. And I was amazed that I had found a bosom friend in a girl 8 years my junior.  Another week had passed. And we still hadn't run out of things to talk about. Gadafi would laugh when I told him about our phone marathons.  "Yeah, man. She's awesome. Be careful though. She's still a kid."  I laughed.  "You spoke to her recently? Or have you been busy with that new babe of yours?"  Gadafi choked. Coughing, he took a deep breath before answering.  "How did you know?  Ni mesti si Myra bagitau ni. Tak guna tul budak tu !"  " Eh. Tak guna tak guna pun, dia tolong intro, kau yang untung . I hear the babe's hot stuff.  Cerita ah sikit !"  " Cerita? Aisehman, ni yang susah ni. Nak cerita apa?  She's Myra's classmate. Came online once and Myra pointed her out to me. So that's it."  Man, this guy must think I'm dumb. Or hoping I'll just back off. Not gonna happen, mate!  " Cun tak? Intro sikit kat aku !"  "No way man! She's mine for now. When I'm done, I'll let you meet her. Gorgeous chick!  Langsung tak macam Myra . In every way. Don't know how they ended up being friends."  So Myra gave me her undivided attention. And I gave her mine. And, funny enough, this is where the story really begins.
