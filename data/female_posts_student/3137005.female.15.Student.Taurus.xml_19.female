I actually saw what looked like a very friendly man this morning, he was clutching his lunchbox and smiling on his way to work. This very friendly man must have been friendly for his was wearing a tie with little ducks on it. I smiled at him and he smiled back. What a nice man! Anyway update on the little miss born-in-a-nosepeg. She still seems to think that her swimming car and her deserve and entire lane thereselves. But me and this very very fit, and obviously in tune with me, guy our age, swam in her lane doing length after length of crawl,s o she had to move lanes or she would have been squished by two above 5ft 7 teens. Ha Ha!!! I always win!!!!!!  Anyway when Sammy finally gets her lazy little bum down there I can do that again, coz i don't know if fit crawl guy will be there again....I hope he is!  Anyway today was good. We actually did something in PE, unless you are Jess. I got strand two sorted out a bit in maths. We sang all through graphics, everything from 'if you're happy and you know it' to 'sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song'. I got an 24/25 A* on my physics, and i finshed everything in German and gotto get ahead on my latin, which meant Luke couldn't copy of me as much.... ha ha!!! I kinda feel sorry for him though. Shannon, Luke and Elenor are getting him moved to the ther side of the classroom. Ah well! I guess I just block out his annoyingness now...It's a skill!  My mum's hair is sooooo cool! I'm getting mine done on Saturday! But Nayway her hair is sooo groovy. It's got all these bright red streaks in it again. As my grandad mannion used to say 'Linda has had her hair done Post Box red again', ahh bless him! Anyway now I am here at my gran's writing this, about to do some art and maths coursework so I have to go now, bye!!!!!! Dani
