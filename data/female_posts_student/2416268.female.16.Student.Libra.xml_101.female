My every effort goes into defeating it, and getting it out of my life, but I wake up every morning and there it is, haunting me, getting bigger and darker everyday. I just would like all my effort and time to actually make a difference.  Although I am incredibablyhappy, I would still love to get rid of it, to defeat it, to wake up one morning knowing that my work had payed off, and that I was thin. I  WILL  defeat it, even if it takes every once of my being, it WILL  be gone!!   Hmm doesn't take a genius to guess what is haunting me....just take one look....ahhh yes there it it!!  x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x  Hmmm I think I might go shopping tomorrow....I shall see what time I wake up because I have to work in the evening...Oh the joy!!  x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.....ha......  .......................  What else can I possibly say, I hope I am not coming across unhappy at the moment, I undersatnd that it might read like that, but I really am HAPPY, I HAPPY OLD NATALIE!! See look......can you see me smiling......laughing at myself as I just bashed my ankle...ooohhhh that fucking bed........
