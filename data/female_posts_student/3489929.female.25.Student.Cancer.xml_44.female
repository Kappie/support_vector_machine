You've become a bit parched, like a cactus waiting for the spring rains.   What the fuck, Tuna Cowboy?   Thinking isn't going to give you the resolution you now seek. Logical analysis will only tend to confuse the real issues of the heart. Throw away the words. Listen to your feelings, for they'll keep you afloat.   Um. I know I'm a Cancer and all, but the water metaphors are drowning me.  Set to the tune of  Three Blind Mice :   MY CAR RUNS! MY CAR RUNS! IT RUNS GREAT! IT RUNS GREAT! I WAS ABLE TO RIDE WITH THE TOP DOWN AND NOT BE SCARED OF THE LAUGHING TOWN- MY CAR RUNS! MY CAR RUNS!   Best I can do on short notice.  But I'm happy. Can't you tell?  Yippeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
