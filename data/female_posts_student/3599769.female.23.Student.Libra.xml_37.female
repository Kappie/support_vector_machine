I'm trying to pinpoint what initiated it. wait, I can't reallly keep a straight thought. I think it has alot to do with not facing the truth. I don't think I've faced the truth alot here recently. A year ago, my highschool sweetheart died and I still havenn't ever really think about him being gone. I kinda blocked it out. And now these things with my lovely boy have happened, and somewhere I have this stupid hope that releases in small doses. You know, the kind where he all of a sudden comes crying back. What the hell is wrong with me? Oh well. Maybe after my dr.s appt. things will be looking up and maybe these feelings well subside somehow, some way.
