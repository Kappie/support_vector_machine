Lucky me, my peer edity-person was an absolute twit. He had absolutely nothing to say, not even sure if he read it. Oh well, wasn't done anyway.  Still, what a dufus.  My cell phone started vibrating during ceramics. I figured anyone calling me in the middle of class probably had something pretty important to say. I was definitely wrong. Ceramics is a pretty free class so I went outside to the porch on the outside of the ceramics building and answered my phone. Turned out to be Steph reminding me that I was her bitch... Not even kidding, what sort of person calls someone to tell them that? Not even surprising though, she had been telling me that most of lunch.   Today was weird anyway, people I didn't even know kept talking to me. Creepy, eh? Nothing rude about it, just random people starting conversations with me. You have to understand, most people don't just approach me like that. Then again, the people who know me say I stand out quite a lot. I'm actually really tall, nearly 6ft... That probably has a lot to do with it. Today I actually got over my fear of wearing high heeled boots. Yay for me! So what if the heels were only 2 inches. I'm still proud of myself. *grins* Anyway, I digress. Why are people talking to me? I know its a good thing but  I'm seriously not used to it... I was sitting around reading an Edgar Allen Poe book today and people kept stopping to talk about it. Whoa...
