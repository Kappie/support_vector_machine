Oh and i've decided we should have big signs tellin which way the classes are! I got lost soo many times and I just loved walkin round with a map shoved in my face like a geek! hahahah! Oh and u ask people where things are and they tell u take a right past the gym. I dunno where the gym is! I'm a band geek- come on! But hey i didn't get trashed or trip and fall on my face so I guess it's a good day!
