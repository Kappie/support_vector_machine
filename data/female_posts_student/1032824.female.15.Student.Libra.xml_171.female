My partner in class. Looking hot huh? ;) 2nd pic: Dasen, Fengrui, Jonathan, Weihao and I acting  dao  (did we succeed?), except for the Head Prefect Jonathan lookin all smiley smiley. Congrats by the way! Jon, your speech was awesome!   Oh yups! Mr Lee brought Fiona, Martini, Geets dear and I to Mac' for lunch today cos it was raining cats and dogs at around 3.30pm and we haven't had our lunch. Hehe! How incredibly sweet of him to drive us there!   I received a very good piece of news today! But.. I don't think I'll reveal it here yet. Hahaha. Just feel happy for me ok? Hohoho. Anyways, to those who are going for tomorrow's Speech Day rehearsal, please do hydrate yourselves! Chill it dudes!
