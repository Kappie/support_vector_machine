The Wounded Knee Massacre part of the cemetary was a mass grave with one enormous grave stone. I also saw a grave of a baby that only lived to be a week old. We had communion once we got to Wounded Knee with grahm-crackers and apple juice. It was really neat.   Later we erected a tipi, which was very cool. I even carried one of the like 15 foot poles by myself!!(minus that it took me like 10 minutes to carry it like 5 feet). Then once it was set up, we all got pictures in it, and sat in it. It was just very neat to be able to see an actual tipi. The Indian women were the ones who used to set up the tipi's all by themselves, in only 10 minutes! How cool is that.   Soon after that, a huge storm came in. It knocked over the tipi while Jesse (aka, Mr. Timberlake) and Tyler (aka, Harry Potter) were under it! But they're okay, which is good. Then we played this game, I can't remember what it's called, but it's really cool on the top of the hill while it was hailing. Then a beautiful rainbow came, and then there were two. It was gorgeous. It was so cool being on top of the hill, because you can see for miles it seems, and it's all silent. I never realized how loud it is where we live.   That night, we all slept outside. It was so peaceful, and I saw 8 shooting stars, and I've never seen a shooting star before so that was amazing in itself. I also saw the Big Dipper. I've never seen the big dipper before either. I had fun, but i felt a little left out, but that's okay. I did overhear Bertha telling some of her made up stories. I swear that child is a pathological liar. Oh yeh, the wind HOWLS out there! No lie. Plus it was cold. And I had a rock under my butt the whole night, but it was so worth it. But enough complaining. WHAAA. -lol- Oh yeh, the sun woke us up too. How cool is that? Well adios amigos.  Liz
