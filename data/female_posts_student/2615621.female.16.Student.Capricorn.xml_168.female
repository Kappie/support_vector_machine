But then again, if you're looking for someone to  hang out..haha Too bad evan (yes yes hot hot hot hot hot ass homemade fucker wucker--and to think we used to be like like tight with that boy! until dumbass katie..) wasnt there. lol Glad to hear you and hollis had a great time. :D oh and i bet that band was kick ass!  *on the phone with momma*  YES YES YES YES!! if only i could do my victory dance!! I told mom my idea about the concert...and...she didnt say no!!!! she said "i will think about it" and i said "yeah it would be nice..since ive been in isolation all summer.." and she AGREED! omg, did my mother just agree with me about going to a concert?! HELLS YEA. she said we'd talk about it when she's more awake. She's been up for a long time, she got back home at about 6 i take it this morning and hasn't gotten to sleep yet, its now like 11:20 there. YES!! fingers are crossed for the concert..fingers crossed! I gave her the sad story about me missing it in nashville because its the day im coming home..and then i told her how i looked to see if they would be in NC...and they were!! i be damned! and then how WOW $19.50!!! and then WOW!! tables and chairs away from the crowd for mom and her bf!! and then WOW!!! i'd fill ur tank up with gas to contribute to the drive! hahahahaha im so full of shit.   ANYWAYS!! THIS IS A GOOD THING!!! now lauren, work on ur rents.   I was reading laurens blog, like i said earlier, and she commented on my song. wow, i had no idea i would get that reaction outta her. I have no idea what reaction i was going for. it was actually going to be kept to myself..but i decided i wanted to post it, and i felt like sharing it with a few friends. Right now im working on music for it and then i might try singing it, but lauren is prob my top choice to sing it! haha She'd put a lot of heart into it. I tend to write songs as my way of dealing with things, and they usually don't leave my notebook. This one did. I guess i was hoping it would make an impact on someone, and i guess it did. Maybe i was just looking for the basic "thats good julia" comment everyone looks for when they show someone a work of art. Something to make you smile and think "maybe i need to do another...". Thanks lauren, u made me feel really good about it. You'll prob be the next topic with you moving away and all..hmmm..maybe a song just for you. :D haha Lauren, you are good at something! You're very talented. You sing, and i think you sing wonderfully! I've seen you in plays! You're wonderful. You're appreciation for musicals and talent is hard to find in someone our age, and i think one day u'll def. find that one thing or do something so spectacular with your life. Dont worry babes. check lauren out at http://thesupposedgoldenpath.blogspot.com :p shes kick major ass ass (as she would say)   I woke dad up at 1am this morning...because i was on the phone. I had been on the phone since 8pm...hahahaha omg what a long ass time to be on the phone with someone! 5 fuckin hours!! OMG! well..we talked for like 2 hours by ourselves and then 3 wayed someone..so i talked to 2 people...it was a very intresting conversation! to make it even weirder, we all 3 were on the computer playing Doodle on yahoo messanger...hahaha I was talking to kristen and nathan. and to think i really dont like kristen...haha weirdness.   Nathan told me i had a sexy lil voice. hes the 3rd guy who has said that. lmao how can someones voice be sexy on the phone?! i mean, i think it when guys have great voices..but me?! He was funny. when he got me off the phone he told me hearing my voice made him wanna fuck me even more. Ive talked to him on the phone before!! ive known the kid for a few years! But the first time i talked to him on the phone was with kristen on the line too and they were dating..so therefore he prob didnt care about my voice. hahaha He told me he would really "love to hang out" with me sometime. yeah...if i really want attention...hahaha. When i called my mom the first time this morning no one answered because she was at grandmas so i left a message..and listened to myself on the answering machine...lmao. i dont find my voice sexy. hahaha i think i sound like a little girl. hahaha  oo maybe i should talk to danny on the phone...hahahhahaha  until next time --- ooh and everyone needs to check out the band Wheat. i recommend them highly. They sing a song called "met a girl" on shrek 2, but all their stuff is good. "All these things" is greatness...  *much love and DUDE i just realized something! sales tax is 9.75% percert here! back home its a freakin 7%!!!!!! or 7.5--i cant remember..DAMN (9.75% is written above the hot dudes name that helped me at hot topic)
