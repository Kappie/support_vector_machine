Possibly the only one who actually reads this...haha. Anywho, its been kinda crazy lately. Anything Goes opens a week from Thursday. Woo hoo. We still don't have a new band director. And we won't for another few weeks. Speaking of band, I completely bombed my wind ensemble audition. Thats what you get for leaving your horn in the garage every night. I mean...not practicing....yeah. Anyway, I had an audition with the head of the voice department at U of I yesterday. I forgot the words so I kept repeating the first verse over and over again. Yeah, it was funny. But other than that I nailed it. He said he was impressed my my high range. Thats right, I kicked ass. Yeah and for my monologue, I took a bunch of lines from Anything Goes, the part where Billy and I are talking about how we spent 12 hours in the back of a taxi. That probably freaked him out a little, but hey, whatever. So it looks like I'll be going to a musical theatre camp in Champaign this summer, yay. And then I have another audition to sing the national anthem at a Schaumburg Flyers game this summer. And Wronski's working there, too. Speaking of baseball, the cubs lost today which really sucked. I actually watched the ENTIRE game. Usually I can't sit still that long, but I did. Yeah. And I've started going to church. I've found one I actually like. So me and jesus are tight now and it looks like I might not be going to hell after all. Lol. And Catchstone rocks my world. Yep, thats been my life for the last two weeks.
