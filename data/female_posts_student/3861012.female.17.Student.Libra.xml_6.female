Exams are so stressful but they'll almost be over and so will the HSC, that's what i figure with how fast this year has gone. AND with the completion of the HSC it brings about lots of celebrations including being 18 YAY for me lol.  I think my Chemistry exam today went alright but english yesterday is another story. I totally didnt answer one of the questions (King Lear) and just crapped on for a couple of pages. really pathetic. But there is nothing i can do now and I have time to work it out before the HSC... i just realise how much work i will have to do for english and how many practice questions.  PDHPE is tomorrow... i should do ok but not as well as i could. but thats always the way right.  well i better get to studying...
