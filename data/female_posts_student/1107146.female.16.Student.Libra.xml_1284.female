I honestly believe that she thinks that she's been the best of friends to us. Also want to choke her because she's managed to make pedchenko, marissa, and other people think that I'm the devil and that i'm the meanst person alive. She "tried" with philip but luckily he's kinda like Z....in more ways than one lucky for me. But also, she's bringing the whole documentations to prove that she's the nice one. I hope that you all don't turn on me like pedchenko did but then again you are closer to me. I love you all....even abby because it seems that she's worthy of Linds. Pray guys. Also...josh i don't think that you should confront her alone. Actually i don't think that you guys should confront her at all. you should stand in the middle all. she thinks that i turned you against her....and i pray that i haven't. please...if you want to talk to her...everyone be there in a happy mood to talk things out. i don't want fighting. i'm so sick of it.
