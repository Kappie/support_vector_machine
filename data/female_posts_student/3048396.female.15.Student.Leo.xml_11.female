It was kinda boring at my Grandmas since it was only Cody, Cassie and I but it was alright. Cody read Cassie stories...and hung with the old ppl like normal. lol. Then I made Jesse make his dip cuz its soo wonderful...and I was eating it as I was walking out the door. We were running late to go meet Kait. But they didn't wait too long...we were only about 15 minutes late. So we get to Humboldt about 7 and we sit around and get on the computer for awhile. I talk to Ross just sayin normal stuff...so he wouldn't think anything was up and then I said I was gonna go on a walk...  So Kait and I walk to his house...a block away we were both like "OMG I have buterflies in my stomach" so we walk around his block and decide to go to the front door. He answers the door and it was just funny cuz he was like what do you want? cuz he only saw Kait and then he saw me and was like What are you doing here! lol It was great. So we stay at his house for awhile...we went over to the park and walked in the fountain...and sum other stuff...then we rented a movie and Kait and I got back to her house about 11:30...Then we stayed up till like 1ish just talkin bout random stuff and watching the food channel. Good stuff....  This morning I woke up around 7:30...which is super early for me. Quite odd. Yeah and Jessica was comin down the stairs and she waved at me....lol then Kait didn't wake up till like 8 so I just layed around for awhile. Round 9 we finally decide we should get up and we hit the showers. When Kait was in the shower I played pollys with Jessica and we messed around with this awesome glitter stuff and got it everywhere. Amuzing...Then we walked to Ross' house and then we went out to eat at Changs. Yes I ate Chinese aren't you proud of me? lol Then we stayed at Ross' house till bout 4:30...not doing much...Looked at some really cute pictures. Hehe. And I stole a pair of his shoes which are super comfy. And huge. LoL. So yeah...it was a great fun weekend...to bad its over...only 18 days till I see both of them again. *sigh* I can't wait....  -Tara
