I just have to say she was a very nice lady who did a lot for her family.  I hope I wont have to post anymore about people I know who have passed on.   This is just something I wanted to add, whatever it means to you is good for me.     Smile  Sitting here thinking about the times we shared The love you gave so freely lets me know you care In spite of all the things we've been through I know it was only a test And now I wish that you were here with me to cure my loneliness   I'll just smile when I think of all the good times I just smile when I think about all the joy you bring When I think about how you touched my life  And how you set my spirit free I just smile when I think about all you've done for me   I never knew before we met what love could do for me And when we were together I saw how strong I could be With all the space between us I still feel you are here And all the love that's in my heart keeps you near   -Robert Randolph  The Family Band-  {I just called to make an appointment to get my hair cut again, I cant stand it in my face anymore.  This will be the third time I'll have it cut in 6 months.  So I wanted it done before I go see Dave on the 18th, and when can she get me in?....THAT MORNING at 8:45AM!}  What kind of shiii is that?!?  But at least I wont have a sweaty neck! HA!  Mmmmm, sweaty neck.  Joys of my two bundles of....joy?  Yesterday we had some family over for dinner.  While we were all outside on the deck, Sophia and Mo went inside and when I decided to go check on them, the salt was all over the counter, the kitchen floor and anywhere else she could shake it... shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it like a Polaroid picture.....  What did she say when I told her that was naughty?  "You should have put it away so I couldn't get it."  No kidding Sophia.  You should keep your little hands to yourself!  What else happened yesterday, oh yeah.  She got the cherry syrup for slushies and poured it on the carpet.  Mo told on her and she got mad at him.  Oh well girlie.  All the adventures of one rolled into TWO!   I found a blog today about a  urlLink guy who works at a strip club in the Midwest, .  He mentions the Colts.  So this place might be near me.  :-\  Maybe I should be a dancer....nah.  I already had this conversation with Sod.  Seems there is a chick who wants to tour the DMB shows this summer and strip at different clubs along the way.  More on that later.    PEACE.LOVE.DMB.  |11 days|
