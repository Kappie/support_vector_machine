Luck is won over and bought just like everything else in this world. I hate what society has done to society. If you watch movies from era's like the 50's, 60's and such, they all look so comfortable. Comfortable with their friends, homes, and everything that was going on around them. Why can't it be like that now? If anyone can answer that for me, I'll owe it too you, because nothing good ever happens to me.
