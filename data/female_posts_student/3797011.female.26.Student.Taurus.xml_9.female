Acctually i have write a little in the profile. But my friend said that it's not enough. Well okay, so this time i will write something abt him....my lover, my fionce n my jan :P  His name is Bilal ...he work in congo now, in a medical office. He is a nice guy (off course nice, coz if not nice he will not become my lover :P hahaha).What i like from him is his honesty, he always tell me all abt what he do, what he feel and all. He never hide anything from me. Though sometime the truth is hurt, but he always said that better you know it from me, than from other. If he do any mistake, he will tell me and then ask for sorry, well sometime it annoying me (off course !!!) but most of all, i really respect him so much. Coz i know to be honest is the most brave act, especially about confess our mistake in front of others :P....(it's true naaa)  He has a strong character and sensitive ...but sooooo muchhhh emotional :P,...and if he angry..i will be speechless (better silent than get shout hheheheheh :P).But he never angry for long time, today he angry, tomorrow he will smile again. What he hate is when someone do same mistake or say something again and again (I often it, fiueehhhh he angry me so muchhhh).  Basically he is a moody person (sometime so cool n sometime so romantic), serious and want other think and do practical. If he has a dream, he will try hard to reach it. He hate someone who always hopeless.   He taught me much abt live and love. One thing that capture so deep inside my heart is abt love to Mother. He said that Mother is our jaan (jaan=heart,soul), so we should respect n make her happy always. and he also teach me always to express my feeling,never to hide it, if im angry i must said im angry, if hurt i must said i feel hurt. He always say me that "there is someone in the world will be happy if you happy and will be cry if you cry, and that person is me, so if u wanna see me happy pls keep your smile and be happy always, coz i love ur smile and i love ur laughing voice" heheheh cieeeeeeeeeeeeee :P:P (make me shy heheheh)   okay that some abt him ....acctually i still have lot to write but i don't want to write all...coz i know you will be boring to read it heheheh.    P.S :Shaki, i have fullfill my promise to you to write a special post for him, someday i will write abt you...just wait naaaaaaaaaaaa...!! Thanks for being a true bestfriend for bilal and me, we will never ever forget all what you do and give to us, your support and love. We always pray that you will get all your dreams and happy always.  " When god gave you to us, He planned capture the image of you deep inside our heart. "  Best Wishes and Love always...from us       ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
