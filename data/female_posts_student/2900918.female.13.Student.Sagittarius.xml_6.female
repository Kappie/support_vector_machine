I love Blink even if they're on MTV, but for avril is a different case. I got nothing against pop, but i hate avril. Nelly Furtado does pop, but i like her. Avril is a fucktard man.. she brainwashes ppl with her "punk rock"  she don even write songs, don even play guitar lor.. seeing her w/o make up is worse. she's even worse than britney lor.. she's lyk britney on the rock side. i remember tat perfect 10 had a contest and if you win, you can catch Blink perform in Sydney  but tat fella damn suay man.. travis broke his ankle while skateboarding and they were performing on 13 march in sydney but travis decided to continue tat show and cancel the rest of the shows. But tat fella is not suay in a way la.. cuz it was postponed rather than cancelled... to some day in sept.. long way to go man..  weekend's here so im kinda gonna chill man.. i love Tom DeLonge!! I love the enhanced cd of blink man.. can watch "MVs" not really la.. is not their official mv s lor...
