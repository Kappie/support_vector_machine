I was up late reading this book, it was really good and I didn't want to put it down. I was reading when I got this huge pain in my side and I couldn't breathe really well. It totally freaked me out, but I ignored it and kept reading. But it got worse so I went up to my parents room and I was freaked out. So I was all hyperventalating and they finally calmed me down and I fell asleep at about 2pm. My dad stayed up and made sure that I was okay for about an hour. I woke up at about 5pm and went back to my room. It was a very unpleasant night! But I made it through and I'm feeling much better now. I have so much to tell you and I think my mom said that you were coming up next weekend or something? I don't know. I was supposed to go get my nails done but I got grounded for not telling my parents where I was going. Well, I pretty much got grounded for yelling back at my mom, apparently it's "Disrespectful". But you know, she didn't ask where I was going so I didn't tell her. That's just how it works! It's called the don't ask, don't tell rule. But yeah, I move out in 26 days. I'm happy and nervous at the same time. GRRRRRR! You know what makes me mad. Okay, I get into huge trouble for not telling my parents where I was going right. Amanda steals my mom's credit cards and they take away her TV and VCR/DVD player...but no other punishment. Isn't that so gay? I was so pissed off. She does something horrible and nothing happens. It's not fair! Parents are so dumb sometimes. But I have to go. I think I'm going out into the sun for a while!  Peace and Love, Melissa
