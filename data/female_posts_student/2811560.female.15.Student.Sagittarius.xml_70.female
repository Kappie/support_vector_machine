Then I went home, showered put rollers in my hair and went back to school for the performance. I was really nervous, a ton of my friends were there. But it went awesome, it was the best I've ever done it. I think it was the best I've ever sang, not just in this play, but ever. I was really happy. No forgotton lines or entrances. It was awesome. Kasper and Pyde came, too. So anyways, after the performance we all went to the cast party at Alex's and that was soooo much fun. It was really, really hot though. There were like 80 people in his basement, kinda scary. It was fun though. Noah, Wronski and Zuber all stripped, so it made everything totally worth it, lol. I was dancing next to Zuber and the whole time I was thinking "Oh God, I cannot believe I'm dancing next to a shirtless man." It was interesting. Richie was stoned off his ass, which was hysterical. They started dumping water on everyone, too, that was kinda weird. It did kinda suck that I had to be home at midnight, I really wanted to stay. Suzie wanted to leave anyway, and she was my ride home, so whatever. I think I'll have to find another ride for the party tonight though, because Suzie was saying she might not even go. I was thinking about asking Laura or Wronski. I'm trying to get the parentals to let me stay out later tonight, too. Hopefully they'll let me.
