Our love is a cursed ride With ups and downs And loops and rounds What I don’t understand Is why we can’t just get off Why we just can’t get off this damned rollercoaster  That first month was the first hill That great climb as things keep getting better and better But then there’s always a fall And of course the rest of the ride With too much going on I’m going to lose it all, Is that why now you never call?  Our love is a cursed ride With ups and downs And loops and rounds What I don’t understand Is why we just can’t get off Why we just can’t get off this damned rollercoaster  All these loops are starting to get to me With it all hitting me at once I’m getting too dizzy I’m thinking about you As I go upside-down again This is really starting to get silly…  Our love is a cursed ride With ups and downs And loops and rounds What I don’t understand Is why we just can’t get off Why we just can’t get off this damned rollercoaster  Now comes the end of the ride The slow stop back at the station After all that action can we stop now? All the flying the looping the hills All the laughing the crying the chills Can I really prepare to take this last vow?  Our love was a cursed ride  With too many ups and downs With too many loops and rounds And now I do understand  How we can just get off Because I’m getting off this damned rollercoaster
