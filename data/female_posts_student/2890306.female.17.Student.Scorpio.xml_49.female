Today was exciting, as I got to wake up and see the world.  What a great day it was too.  Nothing went wrong...well almost nothing.  I forgot my ID at home, you see, but Cindel had me covered (with a big lid) by buying me lunch and letting me borrow her spare badge of identification.  *smile*  What a great friend I have.    In 4th period, as I sat in the choir room , I was overwhelmed with the realization that First Ladies fails to impress me.  I don't like the songs we're doing, nor the motivation level of our group.  I know Suite will be so much better next year because everyone will want to be there.  A more intimate setting surely has its benefits.  Besides, I want to wear a sparkily dress and boogie down like the dancing fool I am.  That's right.  Dancin' foo'.  Some exciting news!  A couple days ago, I signed up for an account on Ebay.  While looking around, not expecting to find anything, I came upon a John Mayer concert poster from Japan that I bid on.  Well, tonight I checked the item, and it turns out that I WON!  Whee!  How exciting!  So, I will be receiving the poster in the mail soon.  Once you start looking around on Ebay, it is so addicting.  They have...anything and everything.  I even searched for "poop" and they had those joke plastic ones.  Haha.  I thought it was cool.  On a serious note, I have my AP Chemistry exam tomorrow morning.  *shudders*  I am nervous, but not as much as I thought I'd be.  My frame of mind is to focus on the large amount of chemistry I've learned, rather than the comparatively small amount that I don't know.  Besides, they don't expect us to know all the information on the test, and that, my friend, is a large reassurance.  After the test is over, Ellen, Ryan, and I are going to eat Chinese for lunch.  Mmmm!  It has been a long time coming for me.  Tomorrow, I'll post the fortune I get.  Until then, remember:   A metal oxide + water -----> Base (hydroxide)  A non-metal oxide + water -----> Acid   Sorry to confuse you, but sometimes facts are remembered best if you write them out.  Good night.
