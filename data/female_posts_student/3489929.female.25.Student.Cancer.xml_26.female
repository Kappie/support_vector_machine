Ahh, the joys of a home exercise machine.   I also received the hat that I ordered for Jefe a month ago off Ebay. To avoid feedback retaliation from the lying dude I bought it from (he told me he mailed it, then when I called him on it, he claimed he "forgot" and would mail it right away) I put some generic b.s. (thanks, nice hat, etc.). Plus, I also received a first-edition of   urlLink  Iris'     The Killing Game , and I can expect to receivefour more books, a purse, and a tie. Then I am quitting Ebay cold turkey for a while. I went a little crazy there and I need to try to have a little more self-control.   A girl at work (we call her "Stacked" because, well, she always has been even before she got pregnant) is having her baby shower this weekend, and Lisa and I are going. The nursery will be Baby Snoopy- how cute is that? I love babies. I want a baby. I think they make adorable accessories, kind of like Prada bags or Steve Madden shoes (okay, I am so seriously kidding here- I did NOT go to the Jessica Simpson School for Mothering).   But now that I am on the subject, I would love to have kids one day. One day waaaaay in the future, when I am able to be self-sufficient and hopefully have a husband/significant other to help lighten the weary load. I'll probably have kids when I hit thirty. My mom says that's fine, cuz she'll be 50 then and won't be a young grandma.   My mom will be such a good grandma. Not like my grandmother, who would cut you down where you standand feed you to a pack of wolves if it would make good family drama. I know I can count on my mom to let my kids know that even if they are horrible brats, she loves them anyway. She'll be a warm, attentive, slightly goofygrandparent.   Daddy, not so much.   Some woman in Iowa screamed at me today that I was rude because I told her if she missed her deadline to open her account with our company, she would have to find another company to help her because we can't keep extending her approval. She bitched me out and said I broke some law because I insinuated that she's not serious about paying her debts, and it's illegal to do that.   Holy litigious bitch, Batman!   *sigh* Some people are just completely outside the box, and they'll never be able to find their way back in even with a neon sign pointing the way.   Overall, it was a good day today. The customer-service manager had a birthday today, and we all got cake. Any day in which cake is involved is automatically a GOOD DAY. Hooray for the miracle that is pastry!   Time to scrounge some dinner and call my mommy to make her jealous about my new toy. Nyah nyah a boo boo.
