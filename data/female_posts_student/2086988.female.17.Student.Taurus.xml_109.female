Also, I'm just in a really good mood :) Probably because I got a really sweet card today :) It's like what the person writes or says is absolutely perfect...and it leaves you speechless. I mean I try to explain the feelings, but sometimes I just can't. They're all in my head, but I get so excited it all comes out weird, lol. This next year is going to be so hard, because I want to go ahead and be with him. In reality, it's not that long, it seems long because you want to spend as much time as you can with the person you love. At least we'll have alot more opportunities for that. I can't wait to go to college and be on my own...Especially being able to see my Davey anytime I want and being together. :) I love you Davey! ::kisses::   The tears of joy for all the pleasure in the certainty  That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of  The highest powers  In lonely hours
