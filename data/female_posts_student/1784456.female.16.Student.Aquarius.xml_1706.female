I'm bad though, I tell everyone everything most of the time, and if I don't I just tell Laura and we sit down and go "God that's so bad" for about half an hour. But keeping something a secret only hurts other people. Let's face it, one person alone gives crap advice, stick two people onto them and suddenly they're the next Rikki Lake. And they're wearing spandex. *ahh!* But if someone's talking to you it means they want help, or if you're a pessimist and believe that your grandma's trying to kill you, you think they want attention. Whatever they want, just be there from them. And if they've shot me remember to tell the police.
