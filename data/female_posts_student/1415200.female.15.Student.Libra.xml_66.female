The guys are amazed at my video game playing skills. They didnt think I could play. But I can. Today was just another blur, nothing good has happened. As usual. I want to go to the last fall from between show, at North Sharon Firehall, but Nooo Im not allowed. I might hafta make it another secret mission..
