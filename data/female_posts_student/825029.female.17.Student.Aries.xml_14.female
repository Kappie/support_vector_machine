Lots of... candy... and some movies or something... and ... sex. =D Reserve your seats now, cause my mom actually gave me permission for it! I figured out today that my mood depends greatly on food.  Yeah, it sounds dumb but... i felt all tired and sad and crud 30 minutes ago and then i had a big dinner and i feel awesome.  So awesome that im writing in here.  PLUS im eating a brownie and a bag of sour gummy bears *drool* mmm...fattening....  hey, chosen ones... youre all slacking off a bit... i should see more meaningless crap written in here.  por favor, gracias te amo... un chakadores... while in "i dont know spanish" mode, id like to say te quiero, melissa, te quiero.  also, a big juicy te amo.  anywayz... my grades are declining cause im slacking a ton.  Ill try to pull it up... so, i guess ill start right now. catch yas latar. ...baby
