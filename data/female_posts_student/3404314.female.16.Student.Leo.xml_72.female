"the measure of your life is the love you leave when you're gone!" remember this quote?! this is from sana'y wala ng wakas.. i didnt like the ending.. i really want ara for leo.. they look good together..  i havent watched mean girls.. i still have to find time for that considering that my prelims will start on july 19.. i have to review especially for zoology..
