First, we had to wait two hours whilst my Mom and some tire people tried to figure out what to do with the flat tire and if they should put on the spare tire or put on another tire and where to put it and..oy. So, that took two hours. Then we actually got on the road! And of course, it's about three hours or something from here to Raleigh..which was delayed..a lot..due to much road construction and a lot of traffic near Durham. So, the trip took about four hours. We then had to wait for an hour to get food from P.F. Changs..mm..it was worth, it though. And I got pants from the mall. Yaay. They're nice.  Ooh..and I got some really good cake from the Cheesecake Factory..yeaah. that was good. Of course, then I had to listen to my grandparents talk about their trip in Saskatchewan, Canada..eh.  On the way back, though, we stopped by Winston and I traded in my games and got SnowBoard Kids..yaaaay! ^_^ It was really really weird, though...once I got in the car, I called Aaron to tell him I had found the game and wouldn't have to get it off of Ebay, but then while his phone was ringing, I checked the back of it and it says "Aaron" in permanent marker. Ok..coincidences like that freak me out. We had a nice time laughing about it, though.  Lets see..  We have kittens (again) and so far we've only been calling them by their colors..like, "Hey look at the grey kitten" or "MOMMM...DAISY'S TRYING TO EAT THE WHITE-PAWED GREY KITTEN"..etc. My sister and I gave 'em names yesterday...so...we decided to kind-of-sort-of going with artists. The black and white one is Escher..my favorite, the grey one with white paws, is Toulouse Lautrec...and we couldn't think of a good female artist name for the grey kitten that's a girl, so it's Phoebe. heheh.   Ah..today I went by the newspaper office to ask about possibly shadowing someone and seeing how our local newspaper works. whee -_-; I had a nice time talking to the editor, though, and I'm going to go in on Thursday and Friday..one day to look at how they do page layouts, and one day to look at the ad designing. That's the stuff I like. I love advertising techniques. I can't help but watch commercials, captivated by trying to figure out how they try to get people to watch them. And I like analyzing ads in magazines 'n stuff to see how they're trying to sell their product. I think it's interesting. And I'm going to need to know the eye-catching design work to be able to pull of the literary magazine this year...so..it'll be good practice, if only that.  And..nothing else has been going on. Well, I've had a lot of fun making confetti out of all the republican mail we've been getting, but besides that..enh.   so much boredom.  Song: Hey Little Girl by Unwritten Law
