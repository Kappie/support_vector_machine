I understand that countries are obligated to respond to genocide and don't want AI saying its one. I understand that AI doesn't want to lost credibility. I understand all that.  What I don't understand is how AI could do this. I don't understand how people can make this decisions without hating themselves. People are being killed, and no one is doing anything. Yeah, right. Threaten sanctions. We don't fucking trade with Sudan anyway, what good will that do? If anything, it'll block aid, and thats even worse. There'll be a famine in Darfur soon because the Janjawid militia is burning crops and the region is subsitence farming.  I can understand why countries are avoiding labelling it a genocide. I hate it, but I can understand it. What I cannot understand is how AI is going along with this. Why aren't they speaking out? I thought these were the people who devoted their lives to fighting for human rights. I thought that they would do better.  This makes me sad.
