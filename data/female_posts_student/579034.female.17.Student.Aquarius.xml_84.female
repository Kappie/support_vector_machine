Plus I needed something to destract me from that silly little thing called studying. I have my U.S. History midterm on Friday. That should be a blast. I was just talkin to Deb about like, well about a lotta things really. Like have everyone has the right to be happy and be themselves. Like, I don't know. I think that yea things are gonna get hard but in the end I mean, you just gotta think about how your gonna feel tomrrow you know? Like... if theres something good, and it works, then why push it away ya know? And we were sayin about how like we feel mature and we just don't wanna deal with shit and she felt bad for makin me listen to the "bad" Debra and I mean, I didn't mind I mean, we all get like that sometimes, I mean I was like that for the most part of the day. I got really weird with my mom and I even had a little attitude to Mick, I don't even know why. Silly female hormones. But... I don't know... then we got into the whole thing about how like I don't like to drink. I mean I just don't see much point in it. Like, yea, okay, lets go out and spend money on something thats gonna impare our judgement and after a while make me feel gross and make me puke. But the fun doesn't stop there, oh no, the next morning you get to wake up with a spilitting head ache AND if you drank enough, your track skills will have just been shot for no reason. Now THAT sounds like a GREAT thing to do. Having said all that, I do plan on drinkin when track ends in the summer, after Notre Dame camp of course. I'd rather not make that big of an ass of myself this year when I go. I'd like to show the coaches there, if the same ones are there, that I came a long way from last year and I mean I just feel like if I drink and fuck up I won't. Plus, I mean my parent's trust means a lot to me for some reason. I worked hard to keep that up and I mean my parents know I'm a good kid and I kinda like that. But.. anyways... thats enough rambling. Oh, James (the Canadian) if you read this, or if you got any of my e-mails tell me the situation with El and if he can stay with you and any other Florida details. I think hes gonna be kinda mad at me once I do reply to his e-mails. Peace all x0x
