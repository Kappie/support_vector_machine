If you're in Australia and on your way back, you get them to get you candy, biscuits, milo, sauces, shoes, clothes ecetera ecetera.  If you're in Malaysia on your way to Australia, they ask you to get them candy, biscuits, milo, sauces, shoes, clothes ecetera ecetera.  God knows what kinda cycle this is but it's straight up weird.  The one thing, everytime we go to Australia, people make us get MILO. And last time I checked, Australia has milo. Infact, Australia has so many other manufacturers of chocolate powder it's insane to ask someone to bring them MILO. Heck, they even HAVE MILO there and don't give me the bullshit about how it taste different and all that because if it does, add more and perhaps use MILK instead of water and bombard the cup with sugar.  People leave wanting a new life. A new experience. Yet they hoggle everything in the past with them.   It's really just ironic.
