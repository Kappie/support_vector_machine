The Chief Engineer joined and we were sitting laughing, joking about the formal night tables, etc. I received call from the Concerige department asking me to report immediately downstairs. I quickly ran downstairs before taking one sip of my wine.  I walked into Chief Conceirge's office and there were four of ym colleagues. A passenger's sister called to the ship to report that their mother had passed away. The man and wife were in their forties so I know it was a shock to them.  As part of my job, I have to tell these families of this news and help them make arrangments for their disembarkment at the next port.  When  the CC told me, I just sat there for a minute and took a deep breath then just reclaimed my composure and went straight to the dining hall. I had to leave the couple a note to call me immediately. I then walked to their room and told them the news. I think it was one of the hardest things I have ever had to tell someone.  But at the same time it was good that it happened and wasn't as bad as a major starcode for my first time.  I have to be the grief counselor for our guests when their is death in the family both onboard and onland. It's a part of my job that rarely comes in to play but last night reminded me of the reality thatit exists.  Today I had to get up super early to assist these people with their disembarkation. I have a meeting later in the morning and then I am going to the beach to just rest for the afternoon.  Kind of strange to be up so early as most of the time I don't come into my office until 8:30-9:00.  I am so spoiled.   Christmas is coming so soon! We have trees all over our ship now! Very exciting. I wonder if Santa will be stopping on our ship??  Shelly
