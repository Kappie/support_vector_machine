We started talking about how we would go to the water park, and then of course..  She starts talking about how we should go out to eat at a steakhouse. And I was like "ew." And she said "Oh, yeah. I forgot. Well, you can eat a salad."   Me - "I don't like salads." Her - "Come on" Me - "I don't eat salads..." Her - "Oh my god. Come on Shelly. You can't force your beliefs onto other people. Just because you're a vegetarian doesn't mean you have to make other people be one."   Lmfao. All I was saying was that I didn't want to go to a fucking steakhouse, and that I usually don't eat salads. And it makes sense that I wouldn't want to go to one, since I'm a fucking vegetarian. Jesus christ. And its not like my parents would go to one anyway. They stopped eating red meat.   Anyway, then she called back and talked to my mom, and in referring to me she said something along the lines of...  "You spoil your children and let them do whatever they want so they grow up to become spoiled horrible brats."   How am I spoiled? I simply don't want to eat dead animals.
