       
      I like to act because I get to put on a mask, and escape reality for a bit. Sometimes I like to keep it on even after the play, just to stay in a non real world, even if only for a little while. But then, when I do that, it becomes harder and more painful to take the mask off again. To face the world through my real eyes. Life isn't scripted. You can't just sit down with a bunch of people and decide what you're going to say, and make sure everyone understands your decisions. Things happen that make me realize that more and more, every day. Not everything will happen how you plan.   That is why I like to act.
