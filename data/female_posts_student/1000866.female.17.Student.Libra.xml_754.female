Before the party, Katharine and I went to the mall to get her a present. We had no clue what to get her, but we found what we wanted to get her within like, the first ten minutes. We got her ths tinkerbell lunchbox from the disney store because we know she likes tinkerbell. :) Then we got her these dirty playing cards from Spencers since it is her 18th birthday.  They had these naked men on them....holy crap.....they were  so good looking. Then we just filled the lunch box with some candy and the cards and stuff.  We made her the coolest card ever too. I made a heart with antlers and it was funny because we couldn't find glue, so it looked like a five year old made the card. Fun, fun times though. Really.     At Diane's house we just hung around for a while. Then, Jim, Stephen, and Cameron, and Ryan (who I was really shocked to see since I hadn't seen him since gym class) showed up. We knew they were there because Jim played his horn. Man, it's the FUNNIEST thing ever. I love it. So, they brought this game they made, bean bags. I'd never played it before, but it's super fun. I was surprised. We had a massive tournament. Fun times.     Then, we had Diane's AWESOMELY GOOD cake. It was so good. I liked it a LOT! Then, I played a game of euchre with Scott,  Bryan and Chris. Scott was my partner and we kicked butt. 10 to 2. We won. They claim it's because I had good hands and...well, I suppose I did. Hah. But, we still rocked them so, it was fun.     Then, Diane opened her presents and people started to leave. So, we just hung around the table. Talking and having a good time. We played this interesting game that probably would have been more fun had I not been tired. I was SO tired by the end of the night. It was crazy. Probably because the night before last, I went to bed at 5 in the morning and woke up at 9. Ugh....that wasn't cool. Well, I'm off to go read or something.
