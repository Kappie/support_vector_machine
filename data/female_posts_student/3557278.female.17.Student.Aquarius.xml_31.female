People are the worst...   aaanyway . I'm just chillin now, having a break. Today i have been to the chiro cos my shoulder is totally stuffed up :( damn damn annoying shoulder. its so damn painful. im so frustrated and annoyed... it wont go away :( So all i have done today is English homework, then chiro, then PDHPE homework, and i still have to do society and culture work as well as possibly some maths. ugh but i need a break.  I got my english results today... 85% hehe thats the same mark as maths which is kind of odd.  gosh so over this shoulder!!!
