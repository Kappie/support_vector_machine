Based on that theory, I am possibly one of the most foolish people of my age.  Simply put, I hate people. I am a certifiable misanthrope for some reason took a job that requires me to not only deal with large amounts of people, but forces me to rely on them to make any kind of money at all. To sum it up, I work in the service industry. The restaurant industry more specifically. I live off my tips, which I can only get by spending long streches of time dealing with and sucking up to ridiculous people.  Of the thousands and thousands of people I have dealt with in the short year I have spent working where I do, only about 3% show signs of basic human morals or intelligences. The rest seem to have absolutely no consideration for other people or their time. I can't even count how many times people have called to place a phone order for food, only to make me wait while they call to people in the background and squabble over what they want to eat. Common courtesy and respect for my job on my part keeps me from hanging up on them completely or asking them to call back, but nonetheless it's  rude.  I have other things to do too. My time is just as valuable.  Moreover, I hate to be ignored. I will always give my costumers the benefit of the doubt and greet them not only kindly, but friendlily. When I approach my table and say hi, ask them how they're doing and they just look up and stare blankly before going back to what they were doing or ignore me completely and pretend I'm not there, it tends to put me off. I'm not asking for a lot; simply acknowledge the fact that  I  have come over to serve  you.   What's more, I despise it when people treat me like a servant or someone socially below them. By that I mean: snapping your fingers to get my attention like I'm some kind of dog rather than a person, calling me over and telling me your ready to order then making me stand there and wait while you decide what you want to eat, interrupting me with something trivial when I'm  clearly  busy doing something else, etc. I understand that people need things, but if you'd just wait the few seconds until I finish up taking a phone order I can help you a lot better.  I know many people will say that I should stop complaining because, hey, this is my job and that's what being a waitress entails and hell, I'm getting paid damn good for it. In reality, that's not the case. My hourly wage is $2.13. Yes, $2.13 a hour. The only real money I make is in tips, and the people I serve are overwhelmingly cheap. On a bill of $30 or $40, I may only get $2 or $3. And it's not because the costumer believes the service was bad. Not to be conceited, but I am not a bad waitress. That isn't the problem because every single server in the place has the exact some problem. Simply put, people are cheap and ungrateful. Anyone that has done it can tell you that waiting tables is a physically demanding job. It can be hard; and when people are rude or cheap, it's even harder.  The lesson in all of this can be summed up very easily: "service depends on my mood and your attitude."  If I recognize you as a chronic cheapskate regular, your service might not be as good as it can be. Other than that; I give you my best, and I expect only the same courtesy in return.  -Kachel
