But today, I realized, a lot of people really piss me off. I hate slutty girls. I hate wishy-washy people. I hate stupid people. I hate hypocrites......  Ok so I was in the middle of typing this when Amy called... We discussed how much we hate everyone, especially Paul. Then Steve took over the computer while held back from stabbing her in the neck with a pen because she's being a dick. And the fashionable thing to do when dicks are unpleasant is to stab them with pens..... That statement was wrong on so many levels....  And now I hate everyone so much that I don't even want to tell you about hating everyone. So instead, I'm going to pack for movie night at Amy's, and even though I really don't want to, I guess I need to shower... Then I will wait for my mom to come home, and I will leave. Then I will come home sometime tomorrow, so can watch Lilo and Stitch with Nick. You see, Nick and Amy are part of a very small group of people that I actually don't hate. They hate everyone too, so we get along well. Did I mention that everyone hates us back? 'Cause yeah, they do.    I hate people who hate things that they don't understand.
