Uncle Blake, aunt Kelly, Cameron and Conner left around 10AM and I spent the entire rest of the day cleaning. And when I say cleaning I mean CUH-LEAN-ING. I swept, mopped, washed, scrubbed, vacuumed, dusted, windexed, fluffed, fixed, wiped, and polished to a shining luster everything in this house. Although I was pretty pooped at the end of the day, I didn't care, I was so sick of sticky fingerprints and Mr. potatohead bits that I wanted it to be spotless. Plus there's always the added bonus of having everyone including mammaw in a fabulous mood. The only disturbing thing about Sunday was that I found out momma is making me go to church! a Baptist church no less! Holy fuck! I calmly and maturely told her that it conflicted with my own spiritual beliefs and that I would rather not attend, to which she replied "get over it, you're going".   Monday was... a blur. After staying up until 2AM cleaning my room and watching cartoons, I got up at 6AM and took a shower. The rest of the day I don't really remember, but Devon says I came home, wandered around, and went to bed at 8PM, which is something I haven't done since I was probably 10.   Tuesday... Ah... Had tons of energy, won my tennis match, and came home to find out that  I was being taken to a thing at church and then dinner with beau. The only reason we all went ((Devon, caitlin, mom, beau)), was to please Mimi, my step-grandmother who's got it in so good with -Jesus- she can't see straight, it was part one of Jesus' "story" where he saves the people and bla bla bla((don't think I don't know the whole thing by heart, I'm just not in the mood to go into it)) ((I like to know everything about something before I condemn it as a load of crap)). So through this entire little play, the four of us((excluding the holier than thou Mimi)) were giggling and commenting on the whole bullshit "sermon" that came after the production. Now I know I haven't been to church in a while... But aren't sermons supposed to sprinkle moral fiber and holiness on you? Well this, I don't know what you would call it... Was awful. a full hour of hearing some idiot tell these made up stories about people who were complete trash until they came to the church.. fuck a duck, these people need to figure out that all these pastors do is beg for tithes. It's sickening. He would read a verse from the bible, interpret it with another verse, then refer to the little white cards where you could give a donation and then join the church. What a stupid Baptist Nazi cult fucked up deal.   anyways, after that Jesus-flavored shitfest, we went to outback grill and I had some fabulous salmon and wonderful dinner conversation. Beau just finished writing a paper entitled "human consciousness as a variable in random events" it discussed experiments done at Princeton alluding to the fact that "wishing" "hoping" "praying" and all mental effort put into something will affect the outcome. Luckily he brought me a copy and it was fascinating. Then of course Mimi got involved, defending god and saying that god was responsible for everything good that happened. Beau replied with a well put speech on how this happens all the time but people make the mistake of forcing religious connotation, then went on to cite another experiment in which people had an incision made on their arm and then had their picture taken. Half of them were prayed over by Christians and wished well by atheists, while the other half were left alone. The half that had been prayed for and wished well by atheists and a collection of different religions had healed amazingly faster than those who were left alone. Mimi was dumbfounded so decided to launch into a spew about how the ladykillers had unnecessary profanity, to which we all cut her off in the quick, arguing that the character would not have been the same had he said "darn" and "fudge" and that without the profanity which was not overdone, the movie wouldn't have had the same feeling and it would have ruined the experience. Needless to say by the end of the meal she was pretty pissed off.   oh and something else cool that happened on Tuesday, mammaw decided to reward me for scrubbing the filthy house on Sunday by getting me a pedicure!!! Yah!!! So now I have soft silky feet and shiny red toes and I'm happy happy. mammaw has been totally cheesing on me lately, she bought me the Sims Bustin' Out for all the babysitting and it came in on Monday, and now with the pedicure I feel like I came out ahead in that deal.  so now it's Wednesday, I won another tennis match but I also got a sunburn. mammaw picked me up and we went to the hyundai place and she bought herself a new car!!! It's a mother-of-pearl colored XG-350 and it's gorgeous!!! She definitely deserved a new car too, she's been driving her Cadillac for 15 years now.   speaking of road rage, congratulations to Emily for getting her driver's license and a car!!! Woo!!! em, you've gotta take me driving!  alright then, I guess that's it except for one thing: I got my email address for yahoo and now I hope everyone will email me. It's RUCallingMeFat2@yahoo.com. my AIM is RUCallingMeFat2 and my msn is the same with @AOL the reason my AOL name doesn't work is because mammaw's in the process of deleting that godforsaken program and it's all messed up.  okey dokey, I MUST go study for my math test.   1. I always have a song or sound effect stuck in my head, it's a miracle I haven't gone nuts yet eh? 2. Right now I've got the yeah yeah yeah's "maps" stuck in there.  3. Yesterday it was usher's new song "yeah". Surprisingly enough, the song didn't bother me as much as "African American" music usually does. 4. I have developed a taste for green beans, something I used to hate. 5. Chewing gum gives me a headache.  Funny little something. Today in World History during our socratic seminar my friend was asking all the questions and was giving me easy ones to be nice. My final question was "is violent pacifist an oxymoron". We laughed and laughed, and I made a 100%
