(sarcastically) that's why i dropped out in grade four, moved to indonesia and made clothes. for my uncles. me: alright then.   yeah. it's really entertaining though. he said a bunch of other dumb things, but it's not like i have a big notepad and i jot these things down or anything...lol. it would be pretty sad if i did, though...  so other than go to drums tonight, i didn't do anything. except drive home from like, sherwood drive. which was entertaining. i heart driving. lol. it's pretty easy, too.  but yeah, i'm gonna go practice drums. later. (if i feel like being a  really  big lackey i'll blog again tonight. lol. buuut i dunno.)  -joebie
