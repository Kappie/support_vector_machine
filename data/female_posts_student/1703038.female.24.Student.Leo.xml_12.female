It makes me self-conscious, I guess.  I'll suck it up, though, and try to start my foray into this whole West Blvd. business tomorrow.  I know, bite back the anticipation...  I'll leave you with this, future educators and music ed. friends: we wonder why teachers are considered lame, ill-informed, and poorly trained?  Here's why:  While U.S. Secretary of Education  urlLink Rod Paige was in Columbia  for a seminar specifically designed to explain and try to defend the merits of No Child Left Behind, what were we--future educators and future subjects of this ricockulous initiative--doing?  Oh yeah, we were in a classroom watching a PowerPoint slide about NCLB at the exact same time.  How the fuck are we supposed to be advocates and activists for the integrity of the teaching profession when we aren't able to even meet our Biggest Boss Ever and grill the hell out of him about this?  Because the morons in our teacher prep classes couldn't pull their structure-addled heads out of their fat, chalk-streaked asses long enough to realize that it's OKAY to deviate from a lesson plan if it means your students will LEARN MORE.  I'm fucking ashamed to be a future teacher sometimes.
