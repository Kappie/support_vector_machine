Not that I was expecting it to be an easy ride, but even the concepts were foreign to me which, considering I rarely miss that class, was cause for great alarm at this stage in the game.  Luckily, for us, we had exams for the Corporate class rather than the Personal class, which is the one we are taking.  The fact that it took us so long to figure this out is a sad, sad thing, that is a subject for another day; today I am choosing to focus on the positive, not the negative.  I'm trying this new thing called "optimism" and you all should really give it a try.
