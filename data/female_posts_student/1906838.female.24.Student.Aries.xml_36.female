No. The brain needs fresh air. God, i was doing neurology today.. and by 6pm the words just seemed as though they were swimming across the pages .. nothing could be forced into this cluttered brain of mine no matter how hard i tried. I contemplated leaving the flat and getting some fresh air, initially decided against it, but then i felt soo miserable that i thought, even if i stayed indoors, it wont do me any good. I didnt even want to watch TV. Plus i needed FOOD. Planning to get me a nice takeaway after this. hmm.. maybe its time for that beef burger ive been craving for ....  God, i miss the study environment back home. and i mean home home. As in our family home in Kuching. We have a patio overlooking a spacious green compound, where dad would put , during my spm days , a table for me to do my studying in the late afternoons. yes, it was occasionally very hot, but that was good for me .. cos studying indoors ( like now) tends to me feel sleepy. arrghh... wish i was home..Plenty of fresh air. Good food. Mom and dad to watch over me ( hehehe.. i am such a big fat baby .. golliwog always says i act like im 14 instead of 24).  golliowog. mm.. miss him too. Can't believe im meeting him again soon. hahahha.. i have now got the same brand of soap i used when i first met him ( which i havent used since) and now its got that pavlov effect on me. haha..
