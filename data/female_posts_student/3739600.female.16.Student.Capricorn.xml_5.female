We mainly talked about all the other shit that's stinkin' up our lifes! But after I got off the phone with himI called another friend. At frist I was kind of afraid to say anything but he knows me better than anyone out there, so he knew something was up. I finally broke and he sat there and helped me sort things out. I'm gald to know that heis there because he wanted to be my friend, not just to be seen with me! Yes still have those questions flowing through my head but it's not as pianful to think of anymore.      Much Lov, Brandi*
