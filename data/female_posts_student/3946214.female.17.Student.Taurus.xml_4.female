Okay, art class is fun, but I really have no idea what the test couldbe about or what I could possibly answer. I was supposed to wake up early today so I could continue studying, but I ended up waking at noontime! And to think, it was a rainy day... all the more reason to get drowsy and fall asleep!  YEahhhhh... okay... I don't know why I'm even typing in here... I just want to play with this keyboard??? hahahahaaa, becoming retarded now... oh my... this is bad... better turn this off pretty soon... @__@
