We went to the lake at like 10 last night and ended up tubing while it was pitch black...Okay, so maybe that wasn't such a good idea, but it sure as hell was fun...And of course it just had to rain all night, so while we were on the boat, we were freezing our asses off. So, we set up our tent near some camp thingy and eat this huge bowl full of soupy stuff...Yeah, and Dan's water thing spilled sometime while we were on the boat, and we get up at like 4 and take the boat back to the marina so we can get to the "Rover" so we can find a gas station. It turns out that we turned the wrong way and thought that we were locked IN the camp--which is ridiculous--but anyways, so we go the nasty bathrooms they have because maybe they might have water fountains...THEY DO!...But....the damn water fountains don't have water!So we take the boat all the way back to our campsite and go back to sleep...We woke up around 12 and decided to take the boat out tubing before I had to leave because of work...So right now, the guys are screwing around and being the crazy guys that they are while I am getting ready for work...Awesome
