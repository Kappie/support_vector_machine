I copy/paste the codes right from the websites... and they either use the same comments for two different posts, or they don't work at all... it's weird, I don't understand it, and I am not interested enough in HTML to fix the problem by way of html knowledge... :-)  Yesterday on the way home from Kerrville, my parents and I witnessed a horrible accident on IH-10... most of the accident was acctually over on the Westbound part of 10.  When we drove by (at a very slow 5 mph) we saw a Channel 4 news van there, so we collectively decided to tune in later and find out the details of the story.  Anyhow, as we went on further on IH-10, it was crazy how backed up Westbound was... I mean, they had redirected people off IH-10 about 2 or 3 exits before the scene of the accident... We were thankful we only sat in traffic for 20 minutes as opposed to the OTHER traffic which we probably would've been sitting in for over an hour.  It was seriously that bad.  I just wasn't moving AT ALL.  Anyhow, later we tuned into the news and found the whole story out...  Apparently, an 18 year old guy was speeding down IH-10, and weaving in and out of cars.  He got impatient about waiting for someone to move over out of the "fast lane"  so he just opted to pass them on the shoulder... He got by them, but clipped a truck that was in front of him, and both of them went flying off their side of the highway, through the grassy median, and into the opposing traffic.  Now, I believe it was the pickup truck that the 18 year old hit that actually hit head on with another car, because when we passed by the accident there was a white truck that was smashed up good, and what looked like a minivan that was pretty much just a pile of car debris.  Then there was a small minty green car in the grassy median.  The minty green car was the one the 18 year old was driving, and since it wasn't too banged up, I'm fairly certain that the truck was the vehicle which hit head on.  Anyway, on the news they said that the couple that was on the Westbound side was returning home to Arizona, I believe from a vacation in San Antonio.  They were killed instantly.  Anyhow, it was just sad to pass all that up... seeing that... and realizing that it doesn't matter how good a driver YOU yourself are, because crap happens, and well, it's usually just a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  If it's your time to go... then it's your time to go.  Because, think about it... is there really that much you could do in a matter of seconds if you saw a vehicle flying at yours from the other side of the highway???  Anyway, at the end of the news report, they said that this teenager had been involved in another (very minor, but reportable) accident that same day BEFORE all this happened... so he may be facing severe charges.  I hope they throw this guy in jail.  I mean, that's just messed up.  He didn't learn from the first mistake he made that day... and because of that, he caused a couple their lives.  Oy!  Okay, well, so that's my sad story... and it's really from yesterday... nothing is going on today, except I'm doing lotsa studying/reading... and doing my assignment for Masterpieces... YUCK!  Oh yeah... and it's raining here... not hard... but constantly.  Maybe I'll post some more later if something happy happens... urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');    urlLink ">Comments
