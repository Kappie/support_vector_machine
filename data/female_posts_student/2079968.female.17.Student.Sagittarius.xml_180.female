It wasn't that big of a deal until the lady was being a total jerk about it...  Anyway...I'm sitting here eating popcorn...it is so good. Mmmm... what a genius snack idea.   So...Daniel's leaving tomorrow...Veronica is a little sad...I don't think I'm also good at expressing emotions.  More later, kids.
