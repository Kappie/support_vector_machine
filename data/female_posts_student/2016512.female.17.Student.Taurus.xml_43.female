EVERYTHING! but at least they gave us the first downs we needed. we struggled today with a lot of stuff out there. i think wade should be QB. he plays smarter than everyone else.  i really want this cd i read about in a magazine. the band is called "Something Corporate." it said they have a Ben Folds-esc about them. but sadly i did not find it at target. i should look up when it gets released because i'm sure by the time it's released i will have forgot about it. damn me and my busy lifestyle.  152...sights into my soul, -Betso
