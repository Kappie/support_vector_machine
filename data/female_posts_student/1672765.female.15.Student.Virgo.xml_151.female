But I just can never seem to do anything about it. I just never do anything about it no matter how badly I want to. Isn't that so stupid? If I want to so badly, you'd think it'd be easy to stop this...but I don't and can't.  I don't know why I can't.  It has to be something about me. I must be stupid. Or weak or whatever. I don't know.  I try so, so hard but it never seems to last.    Music: Steamer Trunk - Alkaline Trio
