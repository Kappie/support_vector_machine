It is the hardest task I have had to do in a long time.    I truly want to save this frienship because they have saved me from making some very wrong decisions and I feel that I have taken them for granted.  As I am turning this new leaf in my life I first had to start with the people I care about and they are definitely up there.  I hope and pray I am able to salvage our friendship and if I am not bring it to some kind of closure.  I love them both and it is scary to think I could face a future without either one of them in my life, but maybe it is a reality that must be accepted.  I'll post more after I do the e-mail and see how it turns out.
