I didn't get home from babysitting and get to bed until about 2:30 this morning...On the plus side of that I got $150 for babysitting for the night.  But, I had to get up at seven this morning to work and I was so tired.  Not to mention, I felt horrible when I got up this morning and I've been feeling sicker and sicker all day.  My throat is sore, I have a fever, and my eyes are really sore.  I have to get up at 7:30 tomorrow because I have to babysit again, but then I should be all set with waking up early for the week.  Today is Randy's birthday!  Happy Birthday Randy!!  I    Wednesday is my visit to Salve Regina; I'm really excited.  When Andrew and I went on the tour together, I  loved  it.  I mean it, I have a serious infatuation with this school.   So all that has to happen is that my parents have to decide that the Newport "lifestyle" isn't too....Newport for me, I guess.  Oh well.  So, I'm off to rest and watch some television, because I'm still feelin' pretty shitty.  Call my cell phone and cheer me up!!
