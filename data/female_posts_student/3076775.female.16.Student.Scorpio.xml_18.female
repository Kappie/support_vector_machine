Then I played Kingdom Hearts, and then talked to Nick for 41 minutes on the phone. After that, I went back to church. The last church service got me thinking though. I realize that I'm really afraid of dying. I don't know what to expect from death. I don't know where I'm going, and I'm scared I'm going to leave so many things undone when I die. I'm afraid that....well, that the people I care about will not know what they mean to me. And, I'm also afraid that I'm not doing anyone ANY good in life..afraid that I've let people down...of course, I haven't shared this with anyone until now. and also, I don't think that my sister likes me at all. I'm really scared that I embarrass her and that she hates me. I know I sound terrible and whiny, but it's how I feel. Guess I'm just a downer at heart. Course, I also got to thinking about how short and uncertain life can be, and how we should never take anything for granted, especially each other. It sounds corny, I know, but oh well. blog at you all later. Love, Shannon "Possessions dwindle; I mourn their loss. But I mourn the loss of time much more, for anyone can save his purse, but none can win back lost time."--Latin Proverb
