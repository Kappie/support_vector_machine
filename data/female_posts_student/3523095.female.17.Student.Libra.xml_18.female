Oh and yaa!!! Forgot to mention…you see, on Sunday I had this really bad dream about pap. Then I woke up…went toilet…came back and sleep…the next morning, I got a call from the person…I knew that it will be the person even before my phone rang…but hey..i also knew what the person would be saying….so I just didn’t pick up the phone….first my handphone rang…then my house phone. Both instances also i didn’t pick up. Just had that sick feeling when the phone rang…and guess what?? When I went to poly today…I just topped up ash card…then…we were walking out…chatting…and this familiar voice…  “oh my god? Is that gayathri?” “um..yea..” [aint super happy] “what you doing here?” [you mean?? I cannot be here w/o your permission? Sheesh!] “very hungry lar..came to eat…” [I pointed sooo obviously at the poly..] “going to meet Vicky issit?” “yea…” [I looked at her friend…dressed like a bitch..] “oh..this is my fren..her name is ________” [ who gives a shit about her name?] “oh hi..” [sarcasm just oozing from my tone..] “ok la…we going now..bye” “bye…”  then I felt like scum…why did I even have to bump into her on that day??? I know I just blanched when I saw her. Just hope that she didn’t notice it…hope it wasn’t obvious….  K me ask one thing…am I just bitching around??? Or being a snob?? Or something else altogether? Well……...i don’t know myself…I guess its just a ego thing. yes you heard me right….EGO.. If you start the damn fight, you jolly well say sorry. Don’t wait for soooo long to say it…and if you don’t, just go your own way. And let me go mine. BUT never never never expect me to call..and say sorry. That happens only when I am in the wrong…and I feel that you truly deserve my apology. But I have to admit….i haven’t really stopped feeling guilty…  Oh well…I guess I need to recover…and right now, I have more important things to think about…like my tamil project…unfinished econs…god!! Two essays…and…4 gp newsweek…and Christ knows what.   Outta here.  bubbyee
