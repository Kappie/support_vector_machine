I got my show music tho i am happy now. I have been waiting to get it. I love bein able to have music that is harder for me. The shows is starting to sound really cool. I had my doubts at first with it bein another insect show but this is one is really cool.I have been playin with the lil kids latly or helping them. It is sooo fun.   Today i went and got my birth certificate so on thrusday i can go and get my permit so i can drive YAY. I am so excited. This should be so much fun. Heather drove yesterday to band praticce and screwed her parking up majorly. But today while i was in flint i saw a Durand Area Schools Drivers Training van. It was sooooo funny I have to say tho, I am not all that excited about going into Flint there is way too many one way streets. But o well i will survive (I hope)  Today i am supposed to go to my dads but i am not sure if i am goin tonight or tomorrow. It depends on which day he gets back from the road. The company he works for has been sending him out on the road latly so he is gone all week. He gets to see lots of places tho. That would be kinda kool but in the same way i wouldn't want to have to do it for work. O well he has done it b4 and he can do it now. Ok well i think i am heading out P34C3 0U7
