It is not the ideal place to live but it is a temporary living situation that will hopefully allow me to save some money and then move on to bigger and better things. I didn't realize how much stuff I have to buy. I am literally starting over from scratch. My ex-boyfriend really cost me a lot but I can't blame it completely on him. When I moved out of Oakland in the beginning of 2003, that was his fault. He just created too much drama at my apartment and I was asked to move. It ended up being overturned because it was an unlawful eviction but ever since it has been hard to find another place. I ended up moving in with my mom and putting all my belongings in storage. Living with my mom was hell on earth and I ended up moving out of there twice, last summer I just could not take it anymore so I moved for about two months and went back and then this summer I packed my stuff up for good and never looked back. I was paying my mom rent and everything. Going to school full time, working part time, and taking care of two kids on my own and all anyone wanted in her family was money from me. I mean I was struggling but I was putting money into everyone else's pocket but no one asked me once if I needed anything and payed everyone on time. My family is just crazy like that, they won't help even if you are trying to do something with your life. Well needless to say I could no longer afford to pay my storage so I lost all of my furniture and now I am going to have to buy all new stuff.. Hopefully that just means it will be better than before.    I have had an unneccessary hard life. The things that I have gone through could have all been prevented. I mean I come from a well off family but it is a family that will stand by and watch you fail even if they have the power to make a difference. Isn't that ridiculous? I put myself through college and even had to keep a roof over my head. I have been on my own since I was seventeen and no one has ever bothered to offer a hand that would make a substantial difference in my life. I had to have my own apartment because my parents allowed my older brother who thirty something at the time have my room along with his girlfriend and son and guess what they have another child while they were living with my parents. At the same time I was working and trying to graduate and I no longer had a place to come back to and call home. Well needless to say I am still doing the same thing, maintaining a roof over my head, while my brother lives with my mom (almost forty now) and working to take care of me and my two children. I guess I am a true survivor. I just have to figure out a way to cut back on working so much so that I can spend some time with my children.
