Not to say that I  could  very well be working on something important right now to catch up in school, but I think it's important to take a break every once and a while from the usual grind. So instead, I've been enjoying myself by practicing flute, downloading music, and thinking of ideas for my composition in Music Theory. I guess you could say music helps a lot when it comes to calming me down and helping me unwind.  These past few days haven't been the best--it seems as though everyone I know has some sort of personal crisis going on right now. Strangely enough, I've been hearing a lot about people's animals (pets) dying. And there are so many other things that I want to address. I wish I could just help everyone. I don't like to see my friends looking worn out and unhappy. But like Azaam said last night, maybe I should just offer to listen, because that's the best thing a friend can do for another friend. I'll try to fulfill that resolution. Another goal I have this year is to restore amends with people who haven't exactly gotten along with me this year (namely...well, some of you know who I'm talking about). I've come to the conclusion that there's no point in having beef with other people. It's so much harder to hate than to be kind and friendly to other people. So hopefully I can muster the guts to confront those few people.  Here's a few things I also wanted to say outloud:  * Insha and Matt, congratulations on qualifying for NMS!! YOU SMART PEOPLE!!  * Insha, congrats on "you-know-what" (wink, wink, wink)  * Natasha, I am very very sorry about your dog. I'll be praying for him.  * Azaam, here's your fucking place in the blog.  * Karin, beautiful piece you made.  * Dream, Rachel, dream (wink)  * Have you looked at your calendar lately? Think about what tomorrow is.  That should do it!!!!
