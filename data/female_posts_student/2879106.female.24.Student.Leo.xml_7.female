Mainly the biggest problem in my life is that I think me and Alek are on the verge of a total melt down. I wrote him last night telling him that I want to separate in order for me to get the rest of my life together. I am not sure that I really want to separate from him. One one hand I love him with all of my heart and I don't ever want to be apart from him. Then on the other hand we are so totally different that it is hard sometimes for us to relate. He is going to be leaving to go to school in the fall and he will be 6 and a half hours away. They say that distance makes the heart grow stronger but I feel that if we are having trouble keeping things together when we live 20 mins apart, it will be almost impossible to work things out when he is in Illinois. What in the hell am I going to do???? I want to go over to his house right now and take him into my arms and have my way with him. I want to show him how much I love him and make him understand that we are meant to be together. But then reality sets in and I realize that isn't a solution. We can't just kiss and make up because this problem isn't just about some fight we had. (Our problems are much deeper than that!!!) Why can't we make this work??? Why does life have to be so hard???  Talking about life being hard. I am such a fuck up!!!! I can't pay my bills. I am in debt so bad that I can't see any light above me while I sit in this hole I have dug for myself. To make things worse I had to borrow money from my best friend just so I could keep my insurance from being cancelled. I am starting back at lonestar tomorrow and I am dreading it like no other. It was so humiliating last night when I had to call and beg Country to give me my job back. I felt so low that I just wanted to die. Everyone keeps telling me that it won't be that bad, but how can it not be. Also I am trying to go full time at American General. Once I do that, I am going to have to work 40hrs a week and go to school 15hrs a week come fall. That is going to be so hard and I am not sure I can even do it. My only hope is that an opening will surface so I can go to full time because if I don't I am not going to be able to go to school at all. Mom has threatened to take me out of school or Kick my ass out if I don't start getting caught up on my bills. I just can't let that happen because school is the only thing going right in my life.   Lastly, I hate everything about myself. I saw a girl the other day that at one time was my very best friend. She used to be my size and was just like me. (you know always looking to lose weight) Well she was so thin that I didn't even want to talk to her. It had nothing to do with her, I was just embarrassed for her to see me in my new even fatter state. Well we talked for a bit and she asked how I was doing. Of course I said great. "Me and Alek are great, Work is great, and School is better than ever!!!" Well in fact none of that is great because even with school we are on summer break and I am hating not being on campus. Well we didn't talk long because Amber was like "We have to go!!" I didn't ask her about her weight loss and I am not sure if I even want to know. I just don't understand how everyone around me can seem to do it and lose the weight and all I seem to do is fall on my face and into a big bowl of spaghetti. (which is what I am eating as I type this.) God I just wish things would change. I wish I could just snap my fingers and be in a fantasy world where everything is beautiful including me. I know that I just need to stop bitching and make things happen but for some reason I just love to be self destructive.  I guess I should end this blog with at least one thing that I am grateful for. This is not hard for me to answer because I know  what the most wonderful thing is in my life and that is my friends. They have all been so wonderful to me. They have been my biggest supporters, my shoulders to cry on, and even my financial help. Thank you guys for everything you have done for me and if you are reading this, I want you all to know that I love you very much. I could not make it through the hard times without you. I just hope that I prove to be the kind of friend you have been to me!!!!   I am sorry for bitching all the way through this blog but I haven't really felt like doing anything else right now. I know that things are going to get better and I know that I can get through anything that I work to achieve. I just have to keep moving and hopefully I will see the light soon. Love always Royale
