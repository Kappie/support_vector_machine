Hmmm, I'm listening to Louis Armstrong...What a Wonderful World. Such a great song, but it really doesn't suit my mood.  I can't decide if I'm looking forward to, A. Band camp and B. School. I really don't know. I'm worried about band camp. I think the only people I can live with for more than a few days are my family...  I'm worried I'll get really really annoyed with everyone, or of course vise versa, and then band wont be fun because I wont want to spend time with anyone. Ah well. I think me not being in the cabin I was supposed to be in is really a blessing in disguise. I wont have the opportunity to get sick of those people.   Hmm, what to do now, what to do? I could read, or watch television, or.....hmm...well, those are pretty much my options. So, I suppose I'll go do one of those things.
