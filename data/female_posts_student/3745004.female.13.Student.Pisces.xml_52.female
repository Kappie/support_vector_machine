Um, so, pretty much a friend comes over- Problems there, I was being such a bitch, but then again.. so was she.. and um vv;; Gonna have to apologize, anyway -then it's my lesson. After my lesson I go shopping for a one-piece swimsuit but end up getting this classy jacket for formal occasions and a white shirt to go under it, because.. um.. low neckline grrmm grmm guh. I also get a black tank top, because I  can .  Come home, time for Bekka to act domestic. -_-;; Cooking almond roca (carmel covered in chocolate and almonds- YUM), in an APRON. XD It... amused me, no I don't know why. But... APRON! :6 So, yeah.. too bad I don't actually get to eat the almond roca >_> It's a "Thank-you" gift for the Clows family.  Annnnnnd today I was over at Diane's house being domestic again, baking cheesecake with Diane for when we're at the beach.  That brings up something important. Tomorrow I'm leaving to go to the beach for a week. I'll miss you all! T-T *huggles everyone*  Baaaaaiiiiieeeeeeeeee.
