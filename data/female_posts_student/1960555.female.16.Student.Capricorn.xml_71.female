(AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, oh my, "Shane, whoa-- you laid an egg." huh)  Scott was attemping to steal Amy's 'cola', ever so stealthaly.... ("if i turn the two cans around really slowly, she'll never know which one is hers!!!!" "Ummm, Scott, mines kinda the FULL one..."  "here's... your.... pop...."  "No Scott, the full one is mine..." "nooooo"  "yesssss")  Tonight was good fun.  Violence towards Amy... Amy's retaliation that lead to the enevatable laying of the egg, the sheer and utter cuteness of Scott and Shane... awww, their so cute (baby voice)  (Amy muttering "Scott's so cute" in the background)  And where the hell was Ed during all of this.... oh yea, and what's up with all the dress shirtedness.  (Scott- "Whadda yea got against dress shirts?" Amanda- "Nothing at all, their hot!"  Amy- "Very formal" Scott- "Mine's got a hole" Amy- "Not so formal" Amanda- "Huh, holes... hot!")  Ahhh, watching the grad DVD again... (Shane- "THAT'S ME!!!  SEE RIGHT THERE!  YEA, THAT'S ME!" Amanda- "Pretty sure that's exactly what you said last time"  Amy- "I think he pointed then too!")  Then of course, there's Kirsten playing with the drumstick... again, abusing Amy.  (-twirl twirl twirl drop- Amy- "Ow"  Kirsten- "OMG, I'm so sorry... I've been twirling it for 1/2 an hour, and I knew I'd eventually hit something")  (Amanda- "oooooh, you're the mop girl!  hehe oh Scotty B"  Kirsten- "Yea, I so just stole a mop from school!")  (Kirsten- "YEA!  It's Scott Bell!"  Amy- "Oh Scott Bell" Shane- "Yea, go Scott Bell!!"  Amanda- "Uhhh, why are we all calling him 'Scott Bell'??"  Kirsten- "Cuz he's Scott Bell"  Amanda- "Oh, well then"  Shane- "And cuz he's cool!"  Amanda- "Oh Scotty Bell".)  (-Amanda being knocked off the couch because Shane's evil and wierd- Amanda- "What was that all about?? That was so uncalled for Shane, oh my!"  Amy-WINK-) Tonight is a tribute to Amanda's Grand Master Plan and Amy's ever so non-chalant winks!
