I am going to describe various people, and see if you can guess who they are!   1. Always just a little bit confused, very tough and could probably beat up me and a number of other people despite her small size. Constantly worrying unneccessarily over her weight, an exercise fanatic and likes eating noodles and salads. Obsesses over Armani.   2. Very imaginative and absolutely hilarious over MSN and through writing, but painfully shy and quiet in person. Absolutely insane ideas that almost always work, and knows more about old languages than Tolkien. Has probably fallen off the sacred cloud one too many times.   3. Craziest fashion sense I've ever come across. 'Baby punk,' if there ever was one, except she worries more over school and hair than is appropriate. She can too sing, despite her protestations, and that damn pumpkin doesn't know what she's talking about.   4. Another 'baby punk.' Could probably create a better and safer CN Tower with normal household objects. I'm in the process of re-decorating her bag. She'll also probably be the first female lead in an emo band. Or the next Santana.   5. Psycho girl who can act damn well.   6. Umm... I need more good friends ^^;   *g* Actually I can think of more, except I'm tired and the game's on and I'm bored. So, ^^;, have fun! Not too hard to figure out, but that was the point, mostly.
