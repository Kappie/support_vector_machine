And thing you said about you are really bored and you want to do something but you are so "blah" that you don't want to do anything. I get that way too. Like right now I feel like that. My brother has a friend over to watch the Super Bowl and I am really bored and want to do something but don't have the energy to do something. February is going to be the longest month for me because of the trip to Spain in March. I just want March to be here already.
