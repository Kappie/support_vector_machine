The downside to all that talent is we expect a lot of them.  The Terminal  is a well made movie, Speilbergs direction is the steady hand we expect and Hanks keeps his character from becoming a caricature or cliche, but it has nothing to say. There's nothing special or important in the story, nor is the film entertaining enough to get by without.  The Terminal  is like watching Lance Armstrong on a stationary bike- wow he's a good athlete, but what's the point if he doesn't go anywhere? While  Terminal 's creative team doesn't overcome the lack of story,  Dodgeball 's stars manage to get by.  Dodgeball  never soars to the height of lunacy of  Shaolin Soccer , but it gets by with some funny scenes and the charm of its stars Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller, playing their typical roles. I may not want to watch Hanks/Speilberg in subpar material, but it's not so bad with Vaughn and Stiller.
