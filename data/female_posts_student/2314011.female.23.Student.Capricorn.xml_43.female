Sounded a bit stressed himself when I called earlier to see how "The Hulk" went and whether it was worth my time.  He said no, so Harley won my attention instead.  Talked to Susan a while ago.  We agreed that our nervousness is a good sign.  We obviously care, are invested and want to do well.  Those without a care, thought, worry, etc. are probably the folks in trouble.  Of course, they could be totally together because of their confidence in their abilities, which is where I think I'm getting to.  As the night progresses, bringing the exam closer, I'm feeling more capable, confident and assured.  Hope it lasts through the night.
