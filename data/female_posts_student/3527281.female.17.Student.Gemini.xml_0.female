Mr. Shonk was giving something other than notes in class? Oh yeah... on test days.   Mr. Taylor wasn't the best teacher ever? puh-lease   we couldn't play instruments?   the first time you bowed on opening night?   the stench that lingered in the chem-is-try room?   cutting in line was actually daring?   you actually cared what the person next to you was wearing?      Sorry.. someone is beginning to get nostalgic, can you tell?   Only one month til move in...
