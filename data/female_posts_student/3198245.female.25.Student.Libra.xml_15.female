Ours is not a fairytale romance but still deserving to be featured in television.  Tini  was after all, my brother's Math teacher. Our courtship was short, about two weeks. I say   "our courtship"   because if I hadn't been a bitch about it, he would've taken even longer! Despite the short courtship, we still lasted this long. Pretty impressive huh?!        So  Tini , here's to our 6th year! Next year may we surpass the  itch  and hopefully get  hitched ! You're the only man whocan stand a bitch like me. And I'm the only girl who can stand a brat like you! I love you so much baber!!! Muah!
