Since CISMF he's talked to me a lot ^^; Now we're all shy again. But that's okay. I'll get over it. Hell, maybe I'll meet someone at Wonderland tomorrow *g* D's not going, btw. He hasn't emailed me or you, so I think it's safe to say he's forgotten. He does that a lot lol.   Of course, I am a total loser for letting a boy affect my mood. I am currently being a bad role model. Little girls, do not emulate me.   But I mean there's other stuff too. Tons of work to do. Actually I miraculously finished my sci. presentation notes today, and most of my history trunk... all that's left is the civics essay. And that's due next Thursday anyway, so I've got tons of time. I'm a bit worried about my sci. presentation though ^^; I hate practicing, soo... might not be 100%-worthy. Of course not much of my stuff is, but I gotta pretend like I'm trying, non?   So that's my life, and it's cool and all, except it's also not because I'm bored. *sigh* Murdles likes someone else (so what else is new? ^^;), I still like the hobbit-meister, and everybody else likes Johnny Depp. Tally ho.
