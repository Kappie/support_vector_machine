There are nights when I feel a part of a unit, just a piece of the whole.  Then there are the nights when I feel contently isolated.,  But the nights I hate the most are nights like tonight, nights when I feel as if I’ve been yanked from my roots and left to wither in the ever approaching sun.  Knowing that I’ll only be gone a month should make it easier, deluding myself into believing that I can come back to today and pick up back at Erica’s surrounded by everyone.  Even though it should make it easier, it doesn’t, not when I think back to standing in Erica’s kitchen looking at my friends, not knowing what to say to express my gratitude for the past year, for its ups and downs, for their unwavering support and their willingness to put me in my place when I needed it.  So instead I said nothing, and merely looked at them, giving quick hugs on my way out the door.  Will my departures always be like this, leaving without saying what I intended, without knowing what I wanted to say until I am alone and driving away from everyone in a dark empty car?  I didn’t return a phone call tonight, I promised I would, but I just can’t, can’t deal with anymore goodbyes right now.  I feel bad for this, even selfish, but I just can’t bring myself to pick up the phone and face another person.  I am glad that my family was asleep by the time I came in the door; glad I got by my neighbor with a mere grunt.  But at the same time I’m lonely and wish I had a person to look in the face and deal with everything brewing inside me right now.  The contradictions are back, the cycle has started once again, and once again I feel lost, spinning round and round, deeper and deeper into my own world.
