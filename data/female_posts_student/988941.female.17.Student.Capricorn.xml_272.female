Once again i didnt do one thing in science i didnt even bother to unpack my bag, what joyus fun. I think Mr moore needs to get some control over the class. He never seems to teach us anything becuase he gets sidetracked and ends up chatting to a group of people in the corner dont ya think ? Everybody is getting well excited about leaving, we still have most of next week yet! I cant believe people are already bringing in cameras and stuff. Fair enough people bringing in the boooks for people to write in becuase it takes time to do that. Everybody is just going hyper and it is making me feel left out ! I am already fed up of school and i cant seem to get myself motivated i still have my french homework to do but i cant be bothered so that will be done on the thursday, which in fact is very stupid because there is loads to do ! Ahhhhhhhhh Just to  let you know Mr Moore is the sexiest teacher in the school other than Miss Kay of course ! Well im now off for my dinner cause i am starving and i need some nutrician (soz bout spelling) toodles
