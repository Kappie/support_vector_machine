Soo I figured I'm charming anyhow. lol. eh? :)  We wont hear anything until the beginning of may. Either way we get a letter in the mail, although the good letter will have a packet with it and will obviously be much less thinner. And I can resist posting here: Don't want no thin packages here! ahahahahahhaahaha I'm so funny!   Back to work, back to work. My GPY 353 presentation is at 430. I have class at 3...so I have 2 hrs and 40 mins to finish my presentation or at least get it together. So T minus 2hrs and 40 mins, take away an hour between 1 and 2 for soaps...and I think I'll get it together. I just have too!  *and thank you for your good wishes! :)  mwah .
