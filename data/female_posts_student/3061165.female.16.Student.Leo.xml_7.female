Then waited for Hong Guan and we went to the church. We were pretty early(and we had to) and saw the vice principal and YiRen walking in too. We were given orders by Mr Lau to reserve 3 parking slots for his parents, his cousin and the bride's cars. It was really hot there and we had most of our jobs done anyway. Well, im skippin all these boring parts now... Jus tat many people arrived - principal, vice-principal, some teachers and 406 students, ex-east viewians, relatives and friends of the groom and bride's.. etc. After Mr and Mrs Lau exchanged the rings and made the vows, i managed to capture the video clip of Mr Lau kissing the bride! Had many more clips too. If anyone wants, feel free to contact me.. I'll send em to you! It was really a sweet and nice event there! Haiz, hope she's there too! The wedding ended with phototaking sessions and the buffet thingy. Perfect couple - both teachers!!! =)  After which, JunRong went to my house(after a long waiting for bus and long bus 17 ride) and watched Naruto anime and played games on the PS2. Was really tired now but still uploading those photos to my   urlLink webshots  . Oh btw, my 2nd webshot account has been created. Feel free to come and look at it! So now i have 2 accounts, one with the user leonwyx and the other with wyxleon. I tink some idiot(who's trying to be funny but not) used the username leonwyx2. Well then... Nvm. 5 more days now... Well anyway.. All de best to your wedding, Mr Lau! ^^    Happy and Excited Kelvin   Quote: One advantage of marriage is that, when you fall out of love with him/her or he/she falls out of love with you, it keeps you together until you fall in again.  Quote 2: A perfect marriage is one in which "I'm sorry" is said just often enough.  Quote 3: Marriage is not a word - it is a sentence.   Poem by  Anonymous : I dreamed of a wedding of elaborate elegance, A church filled with family and friends. I asked him what kind of a wedding he wished for, He said one that would make me his wife.
