Me, well, I will return to the ship shortly and go into work about 5:00ish.   Today has been fun - hung out with Tineke and her boyfriend Ralston. We went to the Red Onion Saloon and had some lunch.  Pretty weird having lunch in a 100 year old brothel hostel. It was established in 1898 as a whore house. I think they have a tour at 3:30 which I may go try and catch.  Today was awesome! I got to talk to my friend Nick on the computer and see him through the camera. It was so neat. I haven't seen his face in years so it was really special.   8 days and counting guys! I can't wait to come home!!! Somehow someway I have to find it in me to stay focused until I leave. Hmm, too many things going on though. As Adam sasy, "Eneh?" Hahaha, smooches.
