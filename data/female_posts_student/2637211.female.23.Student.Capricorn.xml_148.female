That was nice, though brief; I'd have liked to spend more time with Holly. After they all left, I sat down to watch Arrested Development (awesome show). There's been construction next door, so I haven't been as atuned to weird noises as normal. I thought I heard someone at the door, and I was all paranoid, so I wasn't sure if there was really anyone there. I look out the windows and out front, and I don't see anything. But a few minutes later I see some guy going in the back gate and going past the backdoor. And then I get brave and open the door and ask "What's going on?" Of course, this is through the screen gate, so I have bars in between us. I'm all ready to yell at some guy prowling around the house, but the landlord hired him to look at the tree in the back that needs pruning. Sounds fine, but he gave me a seriously creepy feeling. I mean, my eyes are up here. Please look at them, not other parts of me. So he's creepy, and I called Jerm, and he's totally dismissive of me. I honestly closed the door after talking to the guy and I was shaking. I haven't been so scared in a long time. So I'm still bitter at Jerm not comforting me or even trying to make me feel better. He just treated me like I was a fool for even getting scared that some strange, creepy man was wandering around our backyard. He made me feel like a dumb woman.
