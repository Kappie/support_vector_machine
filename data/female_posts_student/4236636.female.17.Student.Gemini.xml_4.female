That would be so horrible to lose ur parents, and then see ur syblings in so much pain when ur feeling it too. Please say a prayer for anyone who is going through that painful situation and cherish your own family because they can be taken away so fast.    A  nyways, it was a really good way to end it, to escape all the petty drama and to go back to y the family is a family now. Just had to share that!   Time for bed... tryouts tomorrow mornin! GOD BLESS                    "In all your ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths." - Proverbs 3:6
