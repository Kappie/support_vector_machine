Everyone else is gonna go c it too, except Dani. I was kinda leanin on the hope that she would wanna hang out w/ me and we could do something b/c i dont wanna be home alone on a friday night but she wanted 2 hang out w/ Tory so i guess im here by myself now. I really have no life. The only person who called me to hang out this weekend was Christina, thats it. I do understand why Dani wants to hang out w/ Tory b/c he's her bf and they don't see each other as much as i c her so i understand.  O well there's always tomorrow.
