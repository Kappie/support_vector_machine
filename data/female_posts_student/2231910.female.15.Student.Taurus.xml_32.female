Why.... Juli ask me,is it tat i feel left out from the clique.No,does i look like the one who is always left out(yellow colour)one? I really feel like giving up on everything,like this i will not have a big headache or stress.But i am sure when the time is right i will really give up on everything.Dun feel like continue,wants to take a nap!!Yah..
