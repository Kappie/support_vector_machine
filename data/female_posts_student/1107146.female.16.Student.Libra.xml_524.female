"Augh, Mrs. Stout, you're such a dingleberry!"...even if I did ace (literally, so as to brag) your test today. HOOAH! It's become my favourite diminuitive! So everyone, join the crowd and be a cool person!  I should be a math major, algebra is easy to understand. Geometry sucks, but o well.  So I need to go do some annotation. My headphones gave up the ghost as I was trying to record today. Sigh...can't be a good artist without good gear.  So that sucks, and life needs to be set on fire at times like this.  Bahamas dimes are really cool looking, I have one here and I should show you all the thingy sometime. It's BADASS!  So anywayz...Happy Solstice all, "have a nice trip and see ya next fall". I got that from the Power Rangers, they're BADASS!  I just used BADASS! twice. Now thrice.  Goodbye friends.
