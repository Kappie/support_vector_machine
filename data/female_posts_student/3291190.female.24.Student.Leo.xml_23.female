Which is great, more power to them. Its just funny b/c you can pick those who are in their "trendy" stage out. Those who will eventually grow up  become just what they hate. Just like a preachers daughter who rebels  becomes something wild, fun, crazy  free. She eventually circles back around  becomes what she was supposed to be. I think its ironic  I just wish I could be there to see when she puts on her first high water pants, keds,  mom sweater. Its nice to watch people become what they condemn...BECAUSE lets face it, everyone is soooo transparent, you condemn those things that hit too close to home, maybe those traits, those ones you love to hate are merely just reflections of you. take a look once in a while, try evaluating yourself  passing judgment on the things you do...ahh but its much easier to look outside of self  criticize everyone else.....
