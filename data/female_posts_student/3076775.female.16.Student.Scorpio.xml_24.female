Last night I got scared cuz Lumpy was making rather odd noises that sounded like someone breaking into the house. Fortunately, it was only Lumpy. Dang, Chelsea writes waaaaaaaaaay too much on her Blogs. I can't possibly ramble THAT much. (lol, had to say it, Chelsea) My granny is sick today, and she took too much cough syrup, so she's been acting rather odd....err, extremely odd. Heh, she sounds rather drunk, if you ask me, or like she's got a hangover. If she's stop smoking, she'd be alright! But NO!! She won't listen to the voice of reason(Me)!! Ah well, she'll do what she wants no matter what any of us say. Ooh! my room is clean! I'm so proud, I almost wanna talk a picture so I can prove that it was clean at one point. Well, I must be going. Nothing to do, and all day to do it.  Love you all, Shannon "Everytime that I look in the mirror, I can't believe how awesome I am!" --Strong Bad
