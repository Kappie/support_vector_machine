Ash's happy because I am. It's all good.  Today was tres amusant. After getting some more tests done at St. Vincent's, I went to one of the IPS schools where I tutor on half-days for their end-of-year parties. I distributed cupcakes to the two classes the students I helped teach (Miguel, who is in 4th grade and Andariya - pronounced "and-air-ee-ay" - who is in first grade) were in. They are so cute!  Now it's back to redecorating my room and packing. (Yes, Ash, I'm redecorating again! How fun!! Your room is next, since Jane's in Vietnam! :P)  "Don't worry. There's more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky..."
