Lately, I've been questioning my career path choice, and all the other choices I've made in my life.  I used to take ballet, and I always wanted to be a ballet dancer since I was very little.  A part of me still does, even though I haven't taken a ballet class in years, am woefully out of shape, and could never ever get back to where I was, and even if I could, I still wouldn't be good enough to actually do it.  But I still feel great regret over the whole thing.  I took the easy way out.  I didn't want to have to work as hard as I would have had to in order to make it happen, so I just gave it up and went to do something else instead.  But I've always avoided doing things I really want.  I don't know if it's because I'm afraid of failing or what, but I always do it.  A part of me has always wanted to write scripts and make movies, and while I've dabbled a little on my own, I've never done anything to actually make it happen in the real world.  I justify it by telling myself that those things I've always wanted most in the world are pipe dreams, and that I am not a dreamer, but a rational, practical person, who would never do something as crazy as that.  Instead, I've always made the rational choice...or what I thought was the most rational choice at the time.  And the rational choice is always the safe choice.  That's why I'm in law school now.  It was absolutely the safest, most rational choice I could have made after college.  Not that a part of me doesn't want to do it, I'm just not sure that it is right.   I worry that it really is to late for me to become what I might have been, but wiser people disagree.  And that gives me hope.
