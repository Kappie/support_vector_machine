As I was receiving the translation of the pact into English, there was a pause following the phrase, "If you do not share your problems with me, you must swallow one thousand..."  I immediately blurted out, "What!?  Goldfish!?" which was received with hysterical laughter.  The pact was one thousand "needles."  Am I sick for thinking immediately of goldfish?   Where on earth did that come from?  More to come...
