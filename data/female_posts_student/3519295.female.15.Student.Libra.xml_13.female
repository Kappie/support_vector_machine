BUT. at the mall i looked over and saw Blake, the super cute soccer player who i like to torture because of the way he plays, runs, etc. sitting in the food court alonenot TWO TABLES AWAY!  so i, being me, go up and plop down in the seat beside him and am like "what's up, soccer boy?" and then I notice that some very cute twelve year old is walking up to the table. he and i make eye contact and my mouth drops open. " Will?!?!"  i shout. no, no way, i am thinking, this boy with short hair could not possibly be the hottest freshmen at North, who i pine over more than any other boy at the whole school. he smiles at me and says "it's katie, right?" and i am thinking "it's whatever the hell you want it to be!" but then i'm like, yeah. he asks if i thought the oklahoma history final was hard. i said "not really; i wasted a bunch of time studying for it, though. i thought lorenz would try and put some trick questions on there." and he was like "me, too, i was really worried about it, but i came out with an A in the class." I asked him if he was playing soccer at ESC and he was like "no, i'm working at my dad's office." i told him about my making the Blue 89ers B starting team, which doesn't sound like much, but it's awesome to be starting for anyone, esp. anyone Blue. Italked for like, five, maybe ten minutes andthen i was like "well, i've got to go." and blaketold me aboutthis party he was havingfor theend of summer at his dad's house and asked it i would want to come. will looked directly at me and i was like "yeah, that'd be awesome", and then i put my phone number into hiscell phone and smiled at them and was like "see ya" and will said "yeah, see ya around"  or...that's what i wished would have happened. really, i didn't know it was Willuntil he walked by my table andlooked right at me.i figured out it was himand i was like,flirt with him!, so i pointed atmy hair and told himi liked his. he said "thanks, katie" and that was it. blake asked me what was up and i said not much, then he said"see you at school".  well, i know i liked the first story better... i'llHOPEFULLY see you later today, meike. bye!
