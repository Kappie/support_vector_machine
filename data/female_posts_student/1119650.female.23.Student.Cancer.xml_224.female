Boy: I dunno if you are ever honest with me anymore or not, and it drives me nuts I AbsolutAngel I: why does it matter? I AbsolutAngel I: like honestly why do the inconsequential details of my life bother you so much Boy: Its not so much that as the fact that going from best friends to lies and half truths through no fault of my own is a little confuding I AbsolutAngel I: well if i tell you the truth then you flip out and have a bitch fit over somethign that really isn't any concern of yours I AbsolutAngel I: so its easier for me to just tell you half the truth or tell you the truth when its convenvinet  Here is the whole truth, live and a lil late breaking but this way I can't be accused of things and this way everythign is out in the open and I can finally say everything I want to say in my blog.  I still am dating Joe.  Yes, thats right.  I am Joe's girlfriend, Joe is my boyfriend.  We date.  He  was  a scumbag and he still kind of is a little, but he's getting his life together.  You can't pass judgement on me because of who I like, love or choose to spend my time with.  If you want to get pissy over this then fine, but thats it...the whole truth.  I am dating Joe.  And yes, I really was in Massachusetts this weekend, so don't even start with that.  If we aren't friends any more becuase of this than that is superfuckinglame, but its your choice and I will respect it and back out of your life.  Bottom line.  The ball is in your court.  You decide what happens now.
