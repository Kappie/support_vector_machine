Im sad but its ok because its what he really wants to do. Ill miss him. Likeliness hell be gone five months and home six months from what he told me. Sadness. Oh well. My dad got a pet snake. Im going to join the choir at church. ummm.... I met Chris in my comm app class. and he ask me to be his girlfirend Nov. 7, 2003. Its probably Katies ,a friend, fault not that its a bad thing.   But she recongnized it and was all "Go to homecoming, Go to homecoming."(together) So we did. His birthday was January 12. He turned 18. We went to eat at anti pastas and then went to his house (me him Alex)   and had cake and he opened gifts. I got I him the day Vince code but he had it. I knew he did not by seeing it but just a feeling but I got it anyways because everything I saw it I thought of him. If you put our bookshelves side by side the pretty much match. Same stuff.    My friend erica will probably be going to collage in about a year. And then hell leave and ill be all by my lonesome. I love this school and the people in it but I think that there is no where that I fit in. I don't miss central Heights at all. Ill have Leslie and Tyler and Daphne but all my church friends suck now. LOL sadness. Oh well. Yeah sooooooo. I guess im done. till later.
