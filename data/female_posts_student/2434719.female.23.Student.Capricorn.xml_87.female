I think I actually have most of one written, since i called my editor after an interview or two and asked him if I could do a feature/profile story on one of the articles instead of just a news story.  i think the first assignment is a bit hokey, but they really need the pictures and article on the front page for the issue following the fourth of july, so i gotta get it done.  but i'm really wrapped up in the second assignment. maybe it's because i'm actually feeling inspired to write it!   i've never liked writing news stories. i did it everyday for class, and it drove me batty.  let's not forget my time with A's oh so wonderful (sarcasm sarcasm) newspaper, The Battalion. If you went to A, I just want to show you another school newspaper so you can see how jipped you were/are. But i've never been one to bash the batt, and i dont want to do that now. I was a part of that team, and I really did and still do respect those that work(ed) on it.   so what about those schools with the great papers? oh yeah, they were well funded,  respected , and had functioning journalism departments. and they like to hear both sides of the story.  amazing what that will do.  ANYWAYS the point is,  i'm actually feeling inspired to write again.   saturday is going to be chaos, running around from place to place trying to meet deadline and covering two things in one day. but i hope it's well worth it. my secret goal is to actually have them finished by saturday night, so i can still go up to conroe. i'll bring it on a disk and email, that way i can wake up early on the fourth, do some last minute edits on story #2 (story #1 is due as soon as i go and write it), and email it to my editor.   i'm going to work all day tomorrow on finishing these interviews, and creating a base outline of my article so everything can go smoothly on saturday.  wish me luck. :)
