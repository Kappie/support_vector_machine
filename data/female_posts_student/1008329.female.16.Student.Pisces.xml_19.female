Mi madre is going to cook for people. HAHAHA. This should be interesting. I hear back in the day she use to actually cook quite a variety of dishes. Then she had children (me  ZAC).          AwWw MaaaN. I'm so dissapointed. Mi amigos en Bako are all having fun times. Nonz, Terry, Bri  Justin(Bri's b/f) are goin' out to the ol' Shafter. I remember when I use to do that. G2 my gma's house for every holiday. Since we moved, however..we did the first year, but then we split up our holidays with others. Last Thanksgiving..I don't remember where we were. Last xmas we were in VA w/ Hartwell  Ginger(James' parents). Anyways. I was talking to Bri  Sophia. Sophia's bday is in a few days(DEC 3). I would tell you the correct amount of days till the joyous celebration, but seeing as how I don't know the present date...I can't. When I go on vaca all time seems to run together. I know there was a time @ Terry's that i totally forgot what or when it was.         Gosh, I really regret some things. How young and stupid I was just a few months ago. No REALLY. I can't believe some things I did (and a lot of them..fo  him ). Ew. Shoot me (not literally you psycho). AH! IT MAKES ME WANT TO YACK MY BRAINS OUT AND THEN WHEN I CAN'T DO THAT, CUT ALL MY SKIN OFF AND BURN IT. It sickens me beyond belief.     Anyways..           My jacket. My perfect xmas. MY dad said yes to what I asked for. Not like he wouldn't. That's one thing I like about not living in ol' Hell (Bako): since I don't see everyone as much..when  I do..SHOPPING GALORE. Yaaah. Even if it's every other month. I guess they feel guilty and give me MULa.         I told mi madre I didn't have enough clothes. She laughed. I was confused. Weird..or wierd?! ahh. SPELL CHECK!           Stalker Theory:        You always think about him/her/it. Him/her/it are the 1st things you think of when you wake up or the last thing you think of at night. It scares you. You tell yourself it's just a crush. Don't kid yourself. YOU'RE A STALKER. ahahahahahahhahahahah.
