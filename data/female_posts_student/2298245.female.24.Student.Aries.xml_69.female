I haven't had time to read the court's opinion, but I do not suspect this is the big deal that it seems at first glance, though only history will tell.  I suppose it is important as a statement, but I don't think it's going to drastically change the way campaigns are run in this country, and it will only be a matter of time before the politicians find loopholes.  That said, I think it is generally a good thing.  And perhaps I will turn out to be wrong about it's relative importance.
