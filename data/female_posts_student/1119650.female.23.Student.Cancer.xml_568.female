We've had our ups and downs as friends, but I'm glad that we can still talk.  I'm so happy for you for all the good things that have come to you as of late, you definitley deserve them.  I hope your birthday is filled with heinies and hineys (c:  I also ordered you a new, shiny titanium hip seeing as you're now 28 (wow, thats almost 30, you old goat!) in case your current one gets too brittle.  I keed, I keed.  Anyhow: hugs and have a great birthday, hun!
