And the great news is tt other class needn't do the chem and math projects...the teacher juz using my class a guinea pigs to experiment their new teaching methods. *shakes head* Sighz. Deadlines also so fast. Math project deadline in 2 weeks time. Sad.  Secondly, amos is in hospital for hydration for a WEEK. Can u imagine how long is tt being stuck there? Mi bro sure bao zha one day...oh yah, and he needs a new kidney soon; the signs are so obvious. Sighz...i think i haf to give it to him, if no one wants to donate. Then again, it must match. So...haiz....quite worried for him...  Thirdly, there're some rumors going on in school about me. Steph came up to me tt day and then asked me "u got bf is it?" I was like ... "WAT!? NO!" And then she said dunno wat rumors about me and tt MEP camp guy...aiyoh...i bet it's xinhui's fault. She and her big big mouth. Comeon lah...cannot be frens meh? Anyway, he's the one who sms-es me...and for the last time, i dun like him in tt way ok? We are juz frens ....want me to spell tt out again? WE ARE JUZ FRENS!!  Ok...enough said...haf to research on my SS project on conflict ... just when there's so much of it to choose from in my life...
