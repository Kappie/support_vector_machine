He is into poetry, some punk,classic rock,heavy metal ( I am too, some of it anyway) and all.. He has his own poetry site. It is the best site I have ever gone to. In my opinion anyway. And he puts so much dedication into it and all. And he likes me too but, IM afraid to tell him, that  like him too, he is on vacation right now in Hawaii, and Japan. And I miss him a lot!!! But anyways.. I met him in a poetry board, and like some guys, they HATE poetry with a passion! But he loves it! And his poems are so good and so deep. and he likes me too, and he is hot. but idc what he looks like, i care about his personality which rocks! and im gonna email him and tell him how i feel. but i am afraid to.. what should i do? should i do it? or should i wait? we've known each other for like maybe six or seven months know, but... what if he doesnt want to have an online-long distance relationship? i'll be soo heart broken. i mean..he's really cool, he makes me laugh, hes honest,sensitive,caring,sweet, and just so awesome..should i go for it? i think i will, omg he has the hottest brown eyes, and black hair, he's tall, he has tanish skin (cuz he's japanese) and he has his own rock band too called: Wasian Invasion (White and asian put together) but what should i say? i dont know what to put and im scared... but lifes about taking chances right? so im goin for it... and i hope everything turns out O.K. well bye for now.. ill write more later..cya
