Oh, shit , I thought, since Mom was out doing errands and Chris was at work and who the heck knows where Christopher was. The warning was for "1:30-3:30" but nothing happened until  three thirty . I had just gotten out of a shower and dressed up in my lovely black leather boots and courderoy jacket to go out. About thirty seconds later, the sky goes dark. The power goes out. It starts raining. I mean, it starts RAINING. There were torrents coming down, it was so bad I thought maybe our cat had drowned outside. I ventured out in a tank-top, through the backyard and the front yard, looking for a trace sign of Tazz. I yelled. I screamed. I couldn't hear myself yell  or  scream.   I was soaked. You could barely see anything beyond the sheets of water pouring down from the heavens. Mom left my Camry's window down, how stupid, and she went out to roll it up. I myself rescued the Jeep windows.  The power was out for approximately 4 hours. In an attempt to block out this potential scar, I am currently listening to my favorite hard-rock station, full-blast. I think the neighbor's yard is barking in protest.  It wasn't that bad - I mean, I am not a high-maintenance person who needs a hair curler and blow-dryer and T.V. every hour and everything else girly-girls entail, but I really missed my music. And about half way through I got this huge craving to play FF. That sucked. But it was fun...I mostly read National Geographic.  And I just found out it was only our block whose electricity went out. Fux0rz to the company. Damn.
