I'm really bummed out though.. well, I got up this morning, talked to Nick, then Chelsea, then took a bath, got ready to go to cyberspace cafe, then left. I got there, say, 12:30ish. I was supposed to meet Nick there at that time, but he got the pleasure of spreading straw all around the yard. so, he didn't arrive until 1:40ish. It wasn't so bad though. got to play checkers again Tuan and Colton. Tuan beat me, but I beat Colton. I just wish me and Nick got to spend more time together today. ah well... After that, me and Chelsea went to the movie theatre. 13 going on 30 was so hilarious! I loved it! The only problem at the movie theatre was that I spilled my drink all in the floor and on my pants. But that wasn't so bad.  We then went to the mall, I bought my mom $25 worth of candles and such from the Yankee Candles store. we then went to eat supper at Sbarro's.  Then we went to the sock hop for Girl Scouts. It was alotta fun. We went home after that, and I dropped my mom's candle!!!! I almost cried, cuz the glass is broken and such. I feel so STUPID!!!!!!!! *sniffles* eh, I'll live, I suppose.  Anyways, Chelsea's over right now, so I'm going to go.
