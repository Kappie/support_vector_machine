It's a really happy, jumpy song, but ever since I chose it to be my alarm tone, it didn't take long before it became one of my least favorite things in the morning. Sleepy. Like a habit, pressed the snooz button. Oh yeah, I have this EQ program going on... yes, need to get up before 8am in order to arrive by 8:30am... I could hear a voice in my mind whispering to me. Opened my eyes and looked at the window. It's still so early, the sky is dark (it's raining). I just don't feel like getting up, from head to toe... struggle struggle.   Before I know it, the alarm rang again. 7:50am this time. Curled into a ball. The reluctance to leave the bed is building up. Wish I'm a little animal, and curling up will prevent me from having to face the fights. Sigh. Meanwhile, thoughts about developing will power starts pouring in. Got up -- it's not so hard, after all. Went to the bathroom and did a full morning routine.  Although I call it a morning routine, the length of it is actually very flexible. If I have a class in 20 minutes, for example, I could finish everything and run out of the door within 5 minutes. If it is a Sunday morning, it could take a full hour. It's almost incredible that someone like me could possibly go to college at the age of 14. I'm the type that could move super slow when there is no pressure. Maybe I was a puma in my last life -- could run really fast, but only run when I really have to. Bad.   By the time I got to my car, it's almost 8:30am already -- time when I'm supposed to be sitting at my desk in ACCP. Sigh, even picking such a low hanging fruit for myself proved to be not so easy. What's making everything fall apart? The deep down relunctance to do something unless I absolutely have to? If I want to let that relunctance reign, I might as well not do a phd at all, and forget about dedicating to making contributions to this society. Got to keep fighting it until the bad habits back down.  Hopefully, I won't fail the rest of the program today. Finish the process maps, follow up with Jeanie, Jon, Ed, mail the stuff I need to, and ask ATA again for the e-tickets.
