Learn about my future husband...I mean...future husband? Now in list form:  1) He sniffs his brother's magical hair-styling stuff. (His bro has greaser style hair.) That explains his drop in grades. Mwahaha.  2)His last name is Villen...something. It means village in Spanish. I forget the rest.  3) I have cheese in my pocket and damnit I feel special.  4)....The end  Lol till something interesting happens, Katie ^ ^
