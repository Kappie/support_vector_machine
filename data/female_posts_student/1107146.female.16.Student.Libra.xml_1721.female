(Attaway.)(So yes...)(I'm helping my sis with her Geometry homework, or at least I think I am.)(I dunno jack about this crap.)(And she's reading this right now, so she's all, "whadaya mean ya don't know?)(And stuff.)(Groovy.)  (Anyway...you all have a psychedelic day.)(Nobody posts on here anymore.)(That comment has some obvious underlying connotations, doesn't it, Abby?)  (Heheheh.)
