Monday, I have a lesson, Karen Dillard Workshop, and a presentation in Dallas on Yale. Tuesday, I have a hair cut appointment, and more Karen Dillards. (and Craig comes home, but I won't get to see him.... grrr) Wednesday, I have leadership 10-4, then Freshmen Kickoff 6-9. Thursday and Friday.... rookie camp and Karen Dillards. Saturday... FULL BAND!!! So that basically take us the week....  Unfortuantely, I will be visiting Karen Dillards quite a bit. I went there yesterday to make up lesson 11, and there were originally four people in the class, but three were out of the county. And, the fourth kid showed up late. So I had around 15 minutes alone with the instructor. And she asked me if I had had her in class before. And I said "yes, last summer". Then she asked me ifmy scores had improved. I said, "a lil, bit. I think...." Then she gave me a look and said that she couldcheck thecharts and see. So, she looks andtells me"no they haven't, but I also see that you haven't been attending workshops or doing practice tests.this is like band. if you don't work then you won't improve." and on and on she went.And basically made me feel extremely stupid. So of course, I was incredibly relieved when the other kid showed up. But she wanted to pick on me because I was a "slacker." So we worked on sample problems and such.... and because I was incredibly frustrated and somewhat downtrodden, I answered them all wrong at first. Way to boost the self-esteem. But anyways, my socre was pretty decent in the end. But I will be going there a lot more now just to prove her wrong. I will do better on the upcoming SAT and PSAT. Plus... I was "making up" a lesson. I obviously haven't been around all that much to go to the workshops and do full length tests.... oh well.... That was my ramble for today. Everything is cool though. I am talking to Leonie, my bud from England. She is awesome, and I can't wait until they come over from England. Three months from today! I can't wait. And Liz is getting her great dane, Jasper from Austin tomorrow.... more Yay! So , that's about it. I  can  keep going... only two people I knowof actually know this journal exists, but I think I will go find some food that I shouldn't be eating in the first place.... I used to have self-control.... dunno where it went.... it would be cool to be teeny again... oh well.... maybe one day with band camp perhaps helping me along a bit....
