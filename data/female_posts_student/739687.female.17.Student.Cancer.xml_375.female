He called me and bitched me out last night because I guess I'm a bitch. Okay he wins...I did ditch him twice. So there shall be no more of him....ahh tough shit I guess.  I not = feel me so good.  No that statement didn't make sense and was not coherent.  I have to get my stupid shot today. Yarr yarr fucking yarr.  Okay...I'm all out of things to say.  find what you need, crazies.
