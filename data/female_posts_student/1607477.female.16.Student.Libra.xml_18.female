For instance, i came up with the idea to make a scary movie and i decided to let one of my good friends co-direct it but in his blog he claimed the movie as his. he wouldnt have even known about it if it wasnt for me. and another thing is that i hate it when people say that it is their blog and they put what they want but then ask for people to give suggestions on what to put, it makes no sense. and the guy who does that knows who he is. i have the right mind to not even let him be in my movie now. and then he says he doubts the movie will ev en get finished. that makes me very very mad, ive worked hard on the script. but he is no longer my co-director, i can do it without him. but another thing that is bothering me is my family and some adults i know. i met a guy at world changers , and my parents have discouarged me about him. everyone keeps saying that he is too old and all these other mean things and they dont even know him. he is a great guy and an awesome christian. He means alot to me and helped me when i needed him. no one knows anything about him. they weren't at world changers they dont know . Billy is great, and i wish my parents wouldnt judge him before they meet him. they say never judge someone before you get to know them but thats exactly what they are doing. and another friend of the family has been rude about it. no one understands and im kinda struggling coz eveyrone i met at world changers understood me. my parents dont know. i just wish that i could be back with the same group of people. i wish billy was closer. i told my parents that he means alot ot me and they were just like you dont know what he means to know and blah blah. and i told my sister about him hoping she would understand but she just said he only wanted me for one thing. and i know that Billy isnt like that. we talked about all that and he is nt like that at all it just makes me really mad. but i am going to play B.S. now i need to concentrate on happiness right now and be glad that i have billy ryan sunny jr and jameson as friends. and glad that i always have my best friend to listen to me when im sad and what not , she rocks. I LOVE U SAMANTHA! ... but anyways good night reeaders.  Lindsay 10:46 pm  July 6th 2003
