I had a list of things to accomplish and I got them all done with the exception of mailing one package out. This is to say also that some of the things on my list caused me to add even more to my origional list. I had a very productive day to say the least. For the   bad news ::  The apartment that I want is not available. I'm hoping beyond hope they will call me back and say something has come up. If not then I will take the second option. For the  stressful news::  Joey came home and said that some kid was "talking shit" about him and he and another friend went to the kids house and was ringing the door bell and kept ringing it until the kid answered then they hit the kid and took off. I am sick of the fighting. I basically went off on him stating that he was attempting to prove everyone right in being like Tony except that I didnt have this trouble with Tony at school just mainly at home. That I was sick and tired of the school calling me weekly (sometimes daily) regarding him and his actions and I was sick and tired of the way that he was acting. That there was no way I felt comfortable starting over in a new place if he was going to contenue to act like a fucking (yes I said it) jackass. He was furious at me but I dont care he needs to realize he has pushed me beyond what I am willing to except. I was willing to overlook some of the fights at school due to it being self defense but some of it wasnt and the disrespect for the teachers WILL stop ! I dont care if I have to start going to school with him to make sure he minds his damn tounge. There is not alot of cursing that goes on in this house and there is a reminder of respect constantly there is NO excuse for him to do this except he wants to be a jerk and I'm tired of it.  Good news::  the information I requested for the homes in VA are here. I feel in love with this one place and cant wait for AC to get here to show him. I'm so excited even though I know we have not figured out what is going on in life yet I still was excited about the information. I felt like we had connected in a way again. Also the phone calls are still coming. The empty blank line and when you dial the number back there is no ring just straight into a song being played it is so wonderful though I wish I knew what it meant.   Robin and her boyfriend had a close call. He said he felt that he wasnt giving her enough time (I told her NOT to push the damn issue but her insecurity gets her and it's REAL bad) and that because she needed more that maybe they should call it quiets until after things are settled down. She talked him out of it. I know that he doesnt want to break up with her I know that he cares about her alot but she is doing the same thing that she does each time she gets a boyfriend and she keeps pushing. I really feel sorry for her.   Ok I am dreaming here so forgive me. I started looking at new furniture dreaming of a new house. 3,000 to 3500 and I will be able to furnish the entire house with things I want and that is on the high end I could do it for less. I had this dream that AC came to me and wanted to "wait" on us getting a place in VA for awhile so that we could contenue to "date" but he was uncomfortable with my lack of funds so he offered to help pay for part of the rent type thing as he said he would be here a few days of the month. It was all a nice dream I know a way to ease my stress for a few moments of the money issues I am facing. Together we found a cute apartment I liked and he saw the stuff I was looking at in this add and said that we could get it and that he would be visiting faithfully each month and wanted to be comfortable when he was here. Ok I know it was a dream but it eased my stress while I had it. I dont want AC for his money I want him for the man he is. Ok well I'm off to dream some more of all sorts of things.. Hey have to have something to do while I do dishes and start to pack.
