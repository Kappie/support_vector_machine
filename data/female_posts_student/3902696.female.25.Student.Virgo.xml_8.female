I haven't felt the same the past few years. I have never been so sleep deprived in my life. I am a self-declared Navy Seal.  I feel as though I have very little to give anyone. If I do more than lay on my bed, I feel exhausted. Every task feels like it takes 100% of my effort. What a lame way to live. And here I am feeling this way, forcing myself to spend what little mental and physical energy I have, on a boring lifeless research paper.  As I was reading today, I heard my door bell ring. I immediately felt the shooting pain through my arm and heart and a momentary injection of energetic alertness. "Who could it be? No one I want to see for sure. Probably a solicitor." I opened the door and was greeted by a young attractive latina woman dressed in nice clothes. I suddenly felt like a bag woman in my stained white T-shirt and boxers with the fly open. I smelled her pleasant perfume. I instantly thought, "I dont have the mental energy to argue right now," as I gazed down and noticed her carrying a Watchtower magazine. I realized, I'm not arguing anymore for a battle that I don't know what side I'm on. Monica was her name. She did a good job of not showing her irritatedness when I told her I had been told that her Bible was an incorrect translation. I told her everything as though "someone has told me that..." it wasn't "I believe that," or "You Jehovah's Witness are wrong in thinking... blah blah." I didn't want to fight. I didn't want to make her feel attacked or that I thought badly of her. I don't agree with what most "Christians" think or believe so why am I fighting their battle?  When I finished talking to Monica, I told God I was sorry for failing him if I did, but that I can not go on pretending anymore. I feel persecution from others: "You're not spiritually strong June. You need to trust God, blah blah." I feel as though I'm closer to God more now than I ever have been in some ways only because I have at least shown God who the real me is. I have shown myself who the real me is. And I'm still figuring out who that person is spiritually. This is my journey and my battle and I'm not letting anyone scaring me back into pretending to be a Christian again. If I become a Christian it's going to be the way I want to be one, and for me and no one else. It may be on my death bed, but I refuse to play games anymore.
