She was 7, I think. She told us all of Elvis's depest darkest secrets. Well, not really. She told us what his room looked like. He has a scooby doo poster, a MXPX poster, and a "bunch of guitar stuff" Hahha. How cool is that.   I talked to him! Hahah. He said "Are you eyes really that blue? I go "No, they are contacts." "Oh...wow! They look really cool!"   It was a little uncomfortable though...considering I was standing in the guys DRESSING ROOM! Lol. It wasn't bad though. He wasjust about to take his shirt of when my friend and I walked in trying to find the owner of a sword we found. Haha. All these guys were changing wiht there shirts of. It was a little odd. :D  All the guys noticed me today. It was odd. They were all like "Your hair looks really pretty!" "I love your hair like that!" I was like ooookkkay. My hair wasn't all that great. Just these little twisty things. La la la  I don't think anything else exciting happened.  Right now my brother birthday thingy is happening. Haha. I am in a laughing mood. La de da de.  I better be going!  Talk to ya'll later!!   Laura
