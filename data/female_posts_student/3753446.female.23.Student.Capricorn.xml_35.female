"What is the correlation of # of beans eatenand # of smelly farts?" "If the average student in this class requires three cups of coffee to stay awake, what is the probability that the professor will say something interesting?" Arrrgh.   So what's the probability thatI'm going to  urlLink jump out of a plane  tomorrow? Its lookin like a 100% baby! Donny, Aaron and I are going to jump tandem from 14,000 ft, with a 50 second free fall, and hitting terminal velocity around 130 mph. Wooow.If blogs don't appear by the weekend, do worry about me.   I'm sooooo excited though. I haven't been able to study all night. Just been talkin on the phone with old friends and planning my New York trip for August. I caught up with New Yorker Nina and Jersey Boy Lutfi. And who knew that both of them had gone skydiving before? They said I'd be scared to death but I'd love it. That's definitely how I'm feeling right about now. I guess no amount of preparation and coaching can really get me ready for the real thing.   The pre-thrill is making me antsy.   My biggest fear as I get ready for this? That they'll open the airplane doors before I'm strapped to my trained professional and I'll get sucked out of the plane sans parachute.   Luckily,Soumya says that can't be possible because the negative air pressure inside the plane sucks air IN, but I don't know if our plane will be pressurized or not.   I guess we'll see how it goes tomorrow. Regardless, the probability of having a great time? 150%  Blog ya soon!
