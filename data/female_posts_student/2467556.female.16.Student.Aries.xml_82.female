I watched "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" yesterday....it was hysterical!  I was laughing for most of the movie! yeah so, please god make my feet stop hurting from all the traipsing through old houses my mom made my family go through today.....it was so evil you guys, you have no idea.  EVERY HOUSE WE WENT IN, the people were like "This is a replica of the original wallpaper" or "this chair is original" or whatever.  It got soooo old after awhile.    Stars won 4-0 over Chicago....i think that was the team.....well they won so who cares!  Mike Modano, Britt's future husband broke his ankle or something, so we hope he gets better.  Next game is vs. San Jose, who we definitley need to take down.  Good luck yet again to my Coppell Boys in Colorado, i know you'll kick ass!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
