I made sure I didn't wear anything too slutty, and made a huge effort not to swear. I think I only said fuck twice :D Its quite an acheivement for me.   There were about 10 people who had applied so we spent the morning playing childish get-to-know-ya games even though all of us knew each others names within the first 20 mins.   I really want to go to Italy, I have my heart set on it and I will be incredibly gutted if I can't go there. Alan Grant, the coordinator was like "Well I'm not trying to talk you out of going to Italy, but you have to understand that it is one of our most popular countries and I just don't want you to be disappointed if you can't go to your first choice country"  Yes I WILL be disappointed. Mostly becuase there is no where else I want to go. He really seemed to be pushing the South American option, and yeah that'd be really cool, but it leaves at the start of next year and I want to go in the middle of next year (for two reasons, one because I can't get 10 grand in 6 months, and two, because I don't want to miss out on all of my 7th form year).  Alan is ringing me tomorrow to tell me whether I've been accepted.... wish me luck!!!
