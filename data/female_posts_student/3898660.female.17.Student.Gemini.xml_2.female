I din know what exactly happen yesterday but i know it is something bad like i have been possessed by ghost or wadever. I was black out when i saw him reached my house door step. He carried me in to my room and he said that i kept crying till my mum was back. Both of them were scared and shocked. But i know nuts about it and i woke up only heard that lester is going home and i said ok.  Well. early this afternoon, i went to the zoo with lester. We're having fun eh! hee. Watched tiget. polar bear and etc. Kept asking wheather i'm tired or wad. So sweet of him! Loving him more and more as each day passes by. We went back home early and rented 3 VCD to watch. But we able to watch 2 shows only.   During the show, i saw bruises on my left arm and i touched, i feel no pain nor itchy. I was scared and wanted to cry cos i thought of probably last night the ghost did pinch me or whatever. Probably i'm just wild thinking. Anyway update again. Dun feel like typing anymore. :D
