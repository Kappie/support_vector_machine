There is also the story of the onion but I won't go into that now. I don't know why people aren't blogging, Tom has already he is busy so fair enough but Jo hasn't said anything so I may have to email her a warning saying that she needs to blog soon. I went to the careers convention at school earlier. Very helpful it was!!! I was chatting away to the lady at the army desk for about 20 minutes!!!!!!!! Then I spoke to the RAF for a while. Fantabulous.
