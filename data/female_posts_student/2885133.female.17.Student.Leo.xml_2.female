It's a whole new world when you are doused with philosophy, more specifically evaluations of evaluations of marxist philosophy right after you are mentally awake.  Oh dearie... apparently my dad won't let me sign up to go to the Republican National Conventiion unless I get MARXISM in my head. Honestly... I don't see how it connects, but I really want to go see a real life party convention. It would be interesting and I get to find out more about various aspects of American politics.  Right now, I must prove that I can understand and utilize Marxism/Maoism so I could get the $2,400 tuition and airfare to go. Oh dear, it's going to be a long summer with philosophy, art history, and biology every day.
