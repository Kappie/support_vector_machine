Especially because I kept looking over my shoulder, hoping that the man would reappear.  “You’ll never get anywhere that way,” a voice said in front of me. I whirled around quickly and the castle seemed to have jumped in front of me.  “What do you mean?” I asked searching for the body that belonged to the voice. A tall gangly man, with a black oversized jacket over a gray vest and white shirt, was slouching on the steps. His top hat was pulled down low over his shaggy hair, and his pants were baggy as well. A silver pocket watch chain hung at his side.  “Well, you keep looking back; you want to go forward right?” He unfolded himself and pulled the hat off his head. Two long tan rabbit ears sprung up, and I saw a matching pair of whiskers attached to a rabbit’s nose. I gasped and took a step backwards.  “Oh, so you do want to go that way. Well if you’re going to walk in that direction, turn around and do it. Walking backwards only confuses you.”  “No, I don’t, I mean…I do want to go that way,” I pointed to the castle, “it’s just, you startled me,” he pulled out is watch, glanced at it, and put it away.  “Hmm,” he sighed lazily putting his hat back onto his head. “Did I scare you then?” He leaned closer and sneered. “Well you’re going to be late.”  “Late! For what?” I said leaning away from him.  “The masquerade, the ball, the dance,” he was spinning around dancing with imaginary partners. The he latched onto me, “Every young woman comes in disguise to kiss the prince and marry him.” He spun me in a circle and caught a hold of me again. He dipped me, his face coming perilously close to mine. “Isn’t that why you’re here?” He righted me, stood back, and bowed. “Me lady.”  “I, um, I dunno. I guess so…” I stammered, flustered, and blushing. Was it the prince I’d come to kiss?  “Well then, madam, go. Go kiss your prince. Go win his heart, and the hearts of the people in your kingdom,” he pulled open the door, and motioned for me to enter. “Hurry down to the ball, but first,” he stopped me before I could leave. I turned to face him anxiously. “Don’t forget your mask!” He pointed to a basket full of them next to the door and I stooped to find one. I grabbed a black feathered one, and began to walk down the hallway.
