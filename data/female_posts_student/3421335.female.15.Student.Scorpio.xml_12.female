Every picture, canvas or raverie, Tells everybody, "This is me." The one who wears a mask, And tries to be happy.  Her heart is just not cold. Just filled with sadness, regret and nostalgia. Once her mind had been bold, But memories made her fade away fast.  A room filled with cans of yellow paint, Trying to cover up every inch of blue. Oustide a stormy weather rained, And inside her heart, it rained too.  Is it tears of happiness, For being strong to move on? Or is it sadness, That she can't let go of what happened so long.  Paints streaks of yellow paint, Trying to cover up the blue. Dawn to dusk to twilight's name, Morning glow to sunset to the shade of the moon.  She waits, and waits, hoping for a sign, She asks herself if she could forget. She would move on, back in line. But she could never forget something so sad     Written by Drifting Heart *Me and my guitar are one* *Me and my guitar are one in eternity*
