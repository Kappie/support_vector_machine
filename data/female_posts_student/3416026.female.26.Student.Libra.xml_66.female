Hmmm... inventing enemies, contriving conflicts, where have we seen that before?  Oh, yeah!    Wouldn't the world be better off if Bush and Saddam just gave their militaries some copying or filing to do during the off-times?  Also, as a sidenote:  I know it's like the pot calling the kettle black, but I can't help but smirk when I hear about Saddam calling Bush a criminal.  It's just so beautifully reflexive. I wish we could put Bush in a little hole and then smoke HIM out.  That would be totally fun.  Oh well.
