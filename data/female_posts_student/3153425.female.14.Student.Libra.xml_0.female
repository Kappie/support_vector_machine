Not much has been happening, really..Just trying to cope with my daily life of SCHOOL. Last week I didn't attend school as I was sick.. Gee, I love tonsilitis. Makes the tummy rumble. I'll just go through a whole bunch of gossip for you... Only thing I can think of doing.  Well, Tom Noonan and a chick called 'Charlotte' got caught in the change rooms at production going at it like rabbits.. Bad luck for Tommy Boy, his mum runs the production. :)    Apparently all the grades at school are getting shifted so it's mixed year classes. E.G: Year 9 and 10 in one class. Utterly Retarded.   Mr Toogood (Yes, that's his name..) wears G-Strings.   Delveck (Matt Delveck of year 11) is a total hotty and Kobi and I are obsessed. Today we found out that he's going out with a chick with huge boobs. Surprise, Surprise.   Steph Bryson slept with 6 guys on the weekend. (Highly Likely)   Rusty thinks I'm a fat bitch. (Highly Likely)  Well, I don't know what else to write. I'm really quite boring.    urlLink GO PIES! Love you boys. ;)  Remember, you're unique.  Just like everyone else.  Steph.
