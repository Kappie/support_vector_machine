I found out my grades for the spring quarter, and am soooooooo happy that I got on the President's List again (GPA 3.75 to 4.0) I got an "A" in English Composition I - "A" in Medical Terminology - "A" in Keyboarding (class was to easy) - "B" in Anatomy  Physiology I. But I have to admit I was a little upset about my A grade as I was only one point away from an "A" :(  I couldn't believe it, just one little stinkin point LOL :)  Oh well! So that put my GPA at 3.75, but in the winter quarter my GPA was 4.0, so combine the two GPA's and I am sitting at 3.87 (YYYEAAHHH).   My new classes for the summer quarter are:  Computer Applications Medical Law  Ethics/Therapuetic Communications Anatomy  Pathophysiology II English Composition II  Over my weeks break from school my husband and I went down memory lane and took a trip to our home (we call home of where we first met 11 years ago) to Copperas Cove/Killeen/Fort Hood. Oh! how I missed the place and didn't want to come back. Alot has changed since we were there, but in about 5 years we will permenately retire there for good :)  The only things that sucks is, they don't have medical assistant jobs :( They only have LVN or RN jobs. The town is small and a little behind the time with big cities, as when we went there for the 4th of July weekend, they had just took into effect the no smoking policy in buildings (if that gives you an idea how slow the town is LOL ) Copperas Cove is the town we want to live at and right now it's popluation is only 29,533. The place is perfect for us with how beautiful the scenic nature is with the beautiful mountains, lush green trees and grass, lakes, and most of all the wonderful temperatures at night and during day verses here in the DFW area :) So guess I will wait and see how the job hunting will go once we move there :)  I would like to Thank the Medical-Assistants yahoo group for sharing this wonderful site. I don't post much there as so busy with studying, taking care of 3 kids, house, etc... that this is a whole lot easier for me to do for all to see what is happening with me and also for all my other family and friends to know too :)  Thank You!!  Til next time!
