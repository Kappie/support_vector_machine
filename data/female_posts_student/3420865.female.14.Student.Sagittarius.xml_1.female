[so really it was a pretty shitty tree house... i'm so gonna make a better one in the summer. who's with me? yes? yes? no.] so yeah, there was this tree near the tree house, and it was perfect for writing on... so erin wrote "fort susk my penis". i think she meant to put "fort sucks my penis", minus the c... yeah, erin's challenged. aha while erin was carving that in the tree, we heard thing falling in the forest... like rocks or something. so we got kind of freaked out, and i thought someone was throwing stuff at us, but erin said there was no one there. but then i saw this person in the distance, and he looked like he/she was like 10 years old. so i started watching him/her (turned out to be a him), and yeah he was throwing rocks at us. i have no idea why... it's wierd. so we like started following him, but he got away on a bike (sneaky bastard...). so then we sat on these rocks and waited for them to come back, but they didn't... so erin walked like 10 steps, and she saw him. and she was like yelling insults at him... it was kind of funny, cuz like i said... he was like 10 years old. but he was kind of a potty mouth...  "hey, nice shot buddy!"-erin, as the guy was throwing rocks at us. "suck my ass, bitch!"-10 year old...asshole.  ahaha. funny kid.  so yeah... after our encounter with the kiddy-wink, we went back to my house and listened to music and talked and went on MSN until my parents went to bed at like 10.. then we watched thirteen and the texas chainsaw massacre... ahaha funny stuff... times 57385. here is just a taste of our awesome sleepover.  "you pushed me to the edge... you pushed me to the edge"- erin, like 47827 times trying to sing along with my brother's band.    "Do it"-guy in texas chainsaw massacre "I CANT!"-girl in texas chainsaw massacre "just do it.. get the knife..."-guy "oh alright"-girl  "want some POOTANG PIE?"- erin, so randomly.  *erin having a siezure while reanacting bloody romance by senses fail*   "If you're havin' girl problems i feel bad for ya son, i got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one.. hit me!"-me, like 538437 times while we were walking through the forest.  "the texas chainsaw massacre"-me and erin in a funny accent, after watching the previews. you definetely had to be there for that one, because obviously i can't do the accent on here.  wow i had a great time... we went to bed at like 2. (i know what you're thinking: "you rebels, you.") it was awesome. and i'm having a part-ay tonight... should be sweet. minus the fact that i'm scared...  k well i'm gonna go get prepared for the shin-dig. ciao. (wow, that's so gino.)  make the same mistake twice. burst of red and green all over me brings the things that she'll love- i should let it form over.  kayte.   p.s. liz, i love you.
