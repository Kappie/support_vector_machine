It's two-twenty-four (refer to the trusty time-date metre if you don't believe me), and I've been home for just under an hour. In science, I could barely write, so once I'd gotten my geography assignment (thirty-nine/forty, Brunsie can't spell 'your'), I went to sick-bay and they a-called my next of kin.       Carney gave me a prada ring! It's so pretty. It's silver, and it says PRADA. It's on my chain, because rings on fingers make me nervous. I always think they're going to get caught in something and rip my entire hand off.    But that's just me.       The Japanese thing was funny. I was so damn nervous for nothing, I guess. Japanese people are nice. Not one of them looked at me weird- props to them for that. Year eleven did about half a million solos (one of which was about elvis' pelvis and was completely embarrassing), and Year Eight danced to 'Hey Mama'.    Shocking, just shocking.    We took Michiko and the little one up and down in the lift- much to their delight.    So yeah. I really want to go to Japan next year now. I've just got to work on the whole 'god, i'm in an aeroplane, I'm going to die' thing, and I'll be right.       **   Bob: I don't want to leave.   Charlotte: So don't. Stay here with me. We'll start a Jazz Band.    -From Lost in Translation. Love that line, love that movie. Watch it.       **
