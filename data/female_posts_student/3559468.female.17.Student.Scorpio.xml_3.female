Sunnydale's no more. Buffy's been spotted in Mexico and Cleveland, with Lil' sis in tow. Angel and Spike are missing, presumed (and rightly so) dead, Xander's started a new life in Florida and is getting on with construction. He is also helping Willow who is his best friend, next door neighbour and a godess, fight the forces of darkness. And now the guy who guided the gang through the toughest time in her lives has gone back to his birthplace, England. The guy in question is Rupert Giles, a watcher with a background in black magic and with a habit of cleaning his glasses.
