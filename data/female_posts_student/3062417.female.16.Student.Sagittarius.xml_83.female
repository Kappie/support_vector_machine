So I was at Josh's for about 2 hours and then rode my bike back home with Carol. Ohh I felt the burn lol. Then I went to Carol's and saw the kittens in the shed. Yea, some stray cat had 2 kittens in Carol's shed. They are so cute!  Today- School wasn't that bad. I barely did anything in all of my classes. And I played cards with Shane and Mike in SH. Shhh it's against the rules. Don't tell anyone lol. Well, I lost really bad but that's ok. I don't even like pitch anyways. After school I went to Carol's and we went on a short bike ride. After that Carol and I found out that one of the kittens got out of the shed so now there's only one left. Then I went to Kimmy's softball game where she kicked some major Little Falls butt. They won 8-2 (?). Kim did awesome. She stole home plate and she slid! Yay Kim! Then I went back to Carols and hung out and watched some of Bio Dome. That's one funny movie. And now I'm just home talking to Eric and listening to music.  Tomorrow I have to go to my Dad's. Oh joy. NOT.  Listening to: [Save Tonight by Eagle-Eye Cherry]  Go on and close the curtains 'cause all we need is candlelight You and me and the bottle of wine and hold you tonight Well, we know I'm going away And how I wish, I wish it weren't so so take this wine and drink with me  let's delay our misery...  Save tonight fight the break of dawn Come tomorrow Tomorrow I'll be gone There's a log on the fire and it burns like me for you Tomorrow comes with one desire.. to take me away  It ain't easy to say goodbye  darling please don't start to cry 'cause girl you know I've got to go and Lord I wish it wasn't so [chorus] Tomorrow comes to take me away I wish that I, that I could stay but girl you know I've got to go, oh and Lord I wish it wasn't so [chorus]
