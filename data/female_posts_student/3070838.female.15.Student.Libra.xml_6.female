Here's a defenicion:   Tantiginous donut - a donut that is able to change shape at any time it wishes.  Now, donut can mean any number of things. It can mean the course of which life continues, neverending. It can mean the circle of people we find ourselves in contact with through our everyday lives. It can mean the way our brain works, moving through things and then coming back to them hours later, in a complete circle. The Donut is our way of saying "our world", basically. Our world of living, our world of thinking, our world of partay-ing, our world of loving, our world of breaking, our world of sharing. It's everything.  La rosquilla es la vida.
