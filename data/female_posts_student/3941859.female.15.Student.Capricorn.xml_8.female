Birds were flying in the sky, butterflies searching for nectars, people roaming around the city. At this time of day, in the city of Denver, you can see a lot of people walking around. Some were working; others were just lazily walking around, some were visiting from a neighboring city. And in the case of Marie Aames, she just came from Mr. Parker’s class which lasted for two boring hours on a discussion about atoms and molecules. When the bell rang, she practically run out of the classroom avoiding Peter and Warner, two guys who are deeply infatuated with her. She knew at this time that there will be a lot of people in the grocery store so she needed to be there first. And now she was here in the line waiting for her groceries to be punched. Alright, my turn, she thought. When she opened the door of the grocery store and felt a touch of the air, she breathed a sigh of relief. God, it was so hot in there it was like I was in a big oven, she thought. But the minute she stepped on the pavement, she was hit by a lad who she hadn’t seen. All her groceries were scattered on the pavement while the guy who was skateboarding fell on his butt.          “Hey!” Marie exclaimed as she watched a can of Coke rolling down the road.          “Oh, I’m so sorry miss. I didn’t mean to. Here, let me help you” the guy said.          “Yeah right! Next time don’t skate if you don’t know how! You just end up bumping in to people.” Marie shouted angrily while picking up all her remaining groceries.          “What? Excuse me but I do know how to skate. It’s your fault. If only you were looking where you’re going to then this won’t happen. That’s why we have eyes, moron!” he retorted back.          “Uh!” she stood up and faced the guy, “How dare you call me a moron! You’re the moron! You’re the stupid one! Oh, the hell with you wasting my time and all.” Marie started to walk away angrily.          “Yeah, you better go home because I’m sick of hearing your voice shouting at me. I think my eardrum is ruined.” Marie suddenly stopped on her tracks and turned back to him. She glared at him from head to toe then back, raised her left eyebrow and said “Who do you think you are, Mister?”          “And who do you think you are?! Here’s a piece of advice, just do your thing and mind your own business will you? I’m off here!”          “You better be!” she shouted at his retreating back. She noticed passer-bys looking at her. “What?!” The people glanced away. She went home pissed off. When she got home, she placed her remaining groceries on the table and sat on the sofa. She looked at the picture of Jake, her ex-beau. The guy has blonde hair and blue eyes. Typical guys that Marie falls for.          “Oh Jake, why did you leave me? If only you saw Mr. Punky a while ago you could have smacked his face. That guy is such a know-it-all.”          “You talking to the picture again Ria? And who’s that know-it-all guy?” her friend, Bianca, said while entering the house.          “Oh I wish Jake’s still here.”          “Oh c’mon Rie! This guy broke up with you almost 3 months now and the asshole cheated on you. And you still want him back? Get real Rie” Bianca replied.         “I know but you know. Why do you have to be so lucky when it comes to the L word unlike me? So so unlucky.” Marie complained.         “Ria... lots of guys wants you! All you need to do is choose. Oh there are no popcorns?”         “Oh yeah. It’s because of some stupid guy downtown.”         “The know-it-all? That him?”         “Yeah. He was skating then he bumped me so all my groceries were scattered.”         “Oh right.” Bianca arranged the remaining groceries. Marie was silent for a minute. Then a thought came up in her mind.         “Ian, can you do me a favor?”         “If it has something to do with money then no I won’t.”         “Oh no no, there’s no money involved. I was just thinking if you can hook me up with someone.” Marie smiled at her best friend.         “What? Rie, are you that desperate? Why don’t you just go out with Cliff? Or better yet Todd? Why do you want me to hook you up with someone when there are loads of men you can choose from?” Bianca asked.         “It’s because I don’t like any of them Ian. You know that! Ask Mark if he knows anyone he can hook me up with.”         “Now you’re also asking my boyfriend a favor? No, Marie Aames, I won’t hook you up with someone.” Bianca declined.         “Yes.” Marie protested.         “No.”         “Yes, you will.”         “No, I won’t.”         “Please?”         “Alright!” Bianca sighed.         “Thank you! I know I can depend on you!” Marie smiled and hugged her friend. Bianca laughed and hugged Marie back.         “Okay, can you ask Mark to set me up on a blind date with someone we both don’t know? And a different guy from the one I usually go out with.”         “I probably could.”         “What about this Friday?” Marie suggested.         “You mean the date? If Mark got one.”         “Cool. But hey, choose one who’s cute.” Marie grinned.         “Sure. And a guy with a hell lot of patience…” Bianca joked.         “Hey! That hurts!” Ria punched Ian playfully.         “Whatever!” Bianca punched back. The two were laughing and fooling around when the doorbell rang.         “Oh that must be Mark. Let him come in and I’ll just change my clothes.” Bianca ran upstairs.         “Okay! I’ll go to work now Ian. See you later! Have fun.” Marie shouted and went to the door.         “Hey Marie!” Mark greeted.         “Oh hey Mark. Gotta split..well have fun you two.”         “Need a ride?” Mark offered.         “Oh no, thanks. I’ll take the cab. Bring her home early, we got an exam tomorrow.”         “Sure ma’am, I will” he smiled and saluted.    actually di pa nga sya tapos e..tapos meron din ako isa pang story gngwa. i'll post the excerpt nun next time :)
