She was the featured artist. So yep, I am kinda proud of my lil sis today. Austin was there.. and he wanted to buy one of her paintings!  Tomorrow.. Caroline's party! Looking forward to that because her house is always fun. :-)  Saturday.. mom, Virginia, and Charles are leaving for the beach! I am so excited! A week of just me and my dad. And he's working late now so I'm pretty much to myself for a week. So I'll prolly have some people over. And then Aunt Rebel (yes, that is her name) told me that Holt's band is playing tomorrow and Saturday at Broussard's in Cape so I really want to see him play since I have yet to.  Sunday.. JP's party! Very excited about that. :-D  So my weekend is pretty packed! I'm excited. :-D
