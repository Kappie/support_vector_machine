The prof's bony finger picked his name off of the list And croaked, "Mr. Borrelli, would you please recite this case?"  And yes, if you must know, I am sitting at home on a Friday night, writing an epic poem about one of my classmates (hey, he was the only taker on my whole epic poem idea - I can only work with what you people give me - plus I rather like it thus far, though at four lines it's not seeming very epic).  Want to make something of it?
