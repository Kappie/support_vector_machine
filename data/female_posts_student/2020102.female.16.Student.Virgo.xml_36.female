I could totally understand that if he was latin or something, but I'm thinking he's not. Although, I could be wrong...but for my sake I'm going to assume he was being a moron who thought he was funny.   I clicked on his website after looking through people who have the same interests as me on their profiles. I thought it looked interesting because he had both Christianity and Atheism listed as interests side by side. Oh it was interesting all right. I just want to clarify a few things that he said about Christianity. I just want to point out what was right and what was wrong, in case any of you ever see it, you'll know.   And he isn't a Christian, so I think I'm a bit more of an expert on our beliefs. But hey, you don't have to believe me. It's your brain. It's your own screwed up twisted and brainwashed mind,don't let me tell you what to think.   He said that Christians believe homosexuality is wrong. Welcome to biggest problem in America 101. It is. For a Christian to walk around saying that being gay is okay, and then claim to know God's laws and commands is impossible. That person is a liar. Mentira. They obvoiusly have not read Leviticus. If you are a Christian, I'm talking to you. Being gay is a sin. I don't think of it any differently than lying, because in God's eyes, sin is sin, there's no difference between lying and murdering. It's a hard concept to grasp, but it's the truth. So I don't freak out about homosexuals. I think it's kinda gross, just because I could never look at a girl that way, but I'm not going to walk around my school and tell people to turn for homosexuality or burn in hell. If that was the case, I would be burning in hell for all the times I'm disrespectful. Thankfully I've got Jesus to pull me out of that.   If you don't believe me that being gay is a sin according to God, well I'm not the one who came up with it. "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable" (Leviticus 18:22) If you don't take the Bible seriously, and you don't believe that what it says is word for word the absolute truth, well honey you need to get a life. Estupido nika. (AY! lo siento) So it says right there that it's a sin, just like lying or cheating, although the consequences are greater.   Then this 'jesus' guy said that Jesus (as in Jesucristo) can save you from homosexuality. Well yea, that's true. Because Jesus saves us from our sin. He saves me from my lying, my cheating, my disrespectful attitude, my cussing, bla bla bla. So since homosexuality is just another sin, he saves you from that, and helps you to turn to God and the right way. In this case, heterosexuality would be the right way; God's way. In my case, using my mouth to be nice and encouraging rather than making fun of people would be God's way.   It's just sin guys. It's a little more visible, that's why some people are so bothered by it. But it's just sin. Hate the sin, love the sinner. Becuase if you don't love the sinner, how will he see Jesus in you? If a man says he loves God and yet hates his brother, he's a liar! God is love, we should be, too.   That's it in a nutshell. That was the one that really bothered me. I just wanted to set the record straight with everything that's going on in the country. How could I let someone tell the world what I believe, and yet be totally wrong about all of it? I had to tell you myself. I just wanted you to know. Becuase this guy 'jesus' doesn't know what he's talking about. But my Jesus does. My Jesus always knows what he's talking about. Because my Jesus is the truth.    (Almost forgot, I'm really sorry if I keep saying stuff in Spanish. I even did it at Master Drive today. I don't know what's wrong with me.)
