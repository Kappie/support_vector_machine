Otherwise I would talk to her again; after the whole thing with Michelle, I had to take some time to sort things out, but, I don't need more than a couple of hours to do so. She on the other hand will dwell on things for what seems like an eternity. Yes, I did start writing  A Figure In October  after I got the news, but, it is not a "funnel" of sorrow. Jackie stop trying to figure me out. Unlike what Jackie says, I will continue posting regularly as well as posting the short stories.
