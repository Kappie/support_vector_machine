I mean, i really only have one major thing i really enjoy is dance, and im not really enjoying that either cuz there is no challenge for me. Im not working. haha, i could apply for a job at publix but I have to wait until after my b-day and i probably wont even apply cuz im way too lazy. Plus school starts on the 9th so I wouldn't have time. hmm...maybe i could go out and skateboard alittle tomarrow. ok well thats my plan, and sleep of course. Theres nothing else todo.Ok well sorry, you must be bored, go read someone else's blog or something cuz nothing interesting is happening here in Sarasota. *sigh*
