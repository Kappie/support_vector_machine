Me and John woke up earlyish and went straight down to good old Eccy field. It was such a nice day! Extremely hot, but unfortunately there asn't any decent kite flying wind (John believe me there wasn't any wind... you were just lucky). I was absolutely hopeless at flying it but after John give me some tips, it was easier and i managed to fly it okish for a minute or so. John's practically a pro lol. Not fair!  Then with a hop skip and a lift we went to Johns for some scrummy yummy Sunday roast. Yummy. Then I fell asleep when the other half was playing some PC games. I had a good hour or so sleep :D I needed it lol. Then we watched some TV and played a game or two and went home! I played on CS and this dummy called me a noob (which tbh I am since I've only been playing a month or two), but the problem is I had more kills than he did! I don't get it! At that point I had 5 kills and he had 2... dumbo boy. Talking about CS, last night John was slept over and we were playing on CS pretty late on. This guy had us in hysterics. He was hacking (which we DON'T agree with) but this guy was a laugh! He wouldn't admit to using hax even though he was spinning around uncontrollably and getting headshots with every shot and his number of kills was amazing! I have to admit the aim bot he was using was damn good :P His name was Mav and the amount of times he changed his name to try and confuse the people who were accusing him I needed a calculator to count. Would you believe he faked changing his name to mine to try and frame me as the hacker lol. The guys who had been on the server from the beginning when there was 3 on a team (as we were) say the funny side, the others just didn't get it lol. Oooo funny funny time!  Anyway that's about it. Just listening to some Ataris, Thrills and a Modest Mouse song called Float On that Jay recommended! C'est tres genial!  :D that's for John... get in touch tomorrow asap!  Ciao xxx
