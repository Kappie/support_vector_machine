"to the extent that one's treasured paraphernalia, ie, tweezers...nail clippers..., won't be confiscated before boarding a plane??" (screeches the bushy-browed, nail-biting girl with pronounced bitterness in her voice.) best to stay away from something that hits so close to home.  well, that leaves topic 1. let's see what my response might look like:  position: yes, limitations should be placed and enforced on campaign contributions. argument: yada yada. counter-argument: but first amendment rights yada yada. counter-counter-argument: true, first amendment rights yada yada, but keep in mind, yada yada. and yada yada some more. conclusion: see what a compelling argument i'm capable of making? now admit me to your law school or thou shalt be condemned to the land of remorse!  okay, you know what the kicker is about the letter i received? "it is our hope that you will use this essay as an opportunity to think about and express your ideas,  research is neither expected nor encouraged ." yeah right. like mad competitive peeps out there aren't gonna be tossing in some legal jargon they just found on the internet to appear politically savvy. oh how i hate those rule-breaching, over-achieving desperados. why can't there be a general consensus among us that no one shall invest more than 30% effort? that ought to level the playing field just enough to work in my favor.  okay fine. i'm actually one of those anal bastardettes that like to spew out the most pretentious facts and figures and act like it's the most natural thing to hop off the top of my head and roll off the tip of my tongue. heh...it's the likes of me that nipped socialism in the bud.  hey there, the due date for this essay is march 15th. wow, that gives me...26 days. and that's not even counting today's productive brainstorming session! pfffffft, PLENTY of time...  whoa, oprah is 50. i must say, girl looks goooood for her age.
