It’s my friend Sara A. Sara A, this is THE BLOG! Never, insult it by called the blog. It must always be capitalized. Hehe. Now, that I know there is a reader reading my inspirational and exceptional writing…that I am making a difference however slight it is in somebody’s day and thinking…it is now that I feel that I have begun to accomplish what I set out to do as a child. What I dreamed about. I can laugh my as* off that somebody actually reads this cra*.   (Yes, I have decided that I will not become corrupted. My mouth will remain clean like a newborn babe. I will speak no falsehood nor utter what I do not know as fact. I will speak as an intellectual, knowing that I am an example to countless others…yeah, right!!)  I’m typing this in my sister’s room, even though it’s light is very dim. It casts shadows in the room that play tricks with my eyes fooling them; like mirages. Me- I like my light to be brilliant, to radiate, to spread everywhere ‘till all sense of blackness has disappeared. To feel enveloped in this light that shines. Till it is beyond impossible to realize that it is night that I am writing this in.   Okay, now I’m in a different room. Literally. We moved back to our room.  You know I was talking to my friend today, after I realized a very embarrassing thing. I brought my mobile with me for like no reason. I mean not one phone call. Not one missed call. Nothing! Whereas my friends kept having to get out of the pool, run, and grab their mobile how many times. Really, its humiliating. I brought a phone with me for people to call me- the fact that nobody did means it was absolutely useless. I mean somebody wouldn’t even have realized I had a mobile if I hadn’t told them. Yeah, I can see it now.  “Hey! I’m so down on credit. Could I borrow somebody’s phone. Please…pplz keep calling me”. Everybody looks around, but nobody wants to part with this treasure. It’s beyond valuable; its vital for their existence. There isn’t enough of it already. Only I scream out “Sure, you can borrow mine. I’ve got lots of credit.” Wait a second. All heads turn around and find me. Everybody stares in disbelief and then everybody’s mouth forms the same question: You have a mobile?! But we never heard it ring.  And then, because I’m so embarrassed I’ll smile meekly and say, “You could borrow mine if I had one.” Everybody will laugh and say, “Okay… you actually had us for a second!”  And now to our second chat that is more an insult trade.   Amina: You know, there are all kinds of idiots. Like your teacher is an idiot because he assigned you homework on a lesson that you didn’t even complete. Your dad is an idiot because he can’t understand that what you’re wearing is style. The guy who takes your order and gives you back your food at a fast food place is an idiot because he brought you the wrong food.  Sara A is an idiot because well, she is.  Mariam: Ahhh! Such an expert on idiots. I presume this comes from first hand experience: analyzing and dealing with yourself, my lovely butthead. I would like you to know that I’ve had a deliciously nice time today at a swimming bonanza at my pal’s. Surely, I did. Actually, we stayed in the pool for such a long time that my skin became as soft as a child’s, but as wrinkled as an old lady’s. Chlorine intertwined and shrouded my hair. I even got the markings of the beginning of a tan. The bronze color that I do love. You know, my chere, today I saw the strength of character somebody could have, but more importantly I discovered something. Do you know what it is?  Amina: I think my buttercup (notice, the usage of the word butt in that delightful flower) that I do know what you mean. You discovered how to use makeup. Was my deduction correct? Otherwise, how the heck can you claim that your skin was turning the color of bronze? Or maybe you discovered true imagination. Was that one correct? You know, my dumpling, I don’t believe that our guests (those people who don’t bother to write comments but read what we wrote) don’t know that we actually made up a game, several years ago, that had the same idea as the “Powerpuff girls.” And to think that we could have been famous if we had sold our idea long ago…:(   Mariam: Ahhh! (Notice how my paragraphs always start like that) I see, that you have not discovered what it is. However, once a wise woman said “Knowledge comes not from within but from what diffuses from the journey of life”, I can not share this information with you. In case, you didn’t guess who was the eloquent owner of this saying it is your butercup. (That my dearie, is the proper way to spell it when talking to moi). About our lovely game, please don’t insult it and me. You know it was 100x better than the Powerpuff gurls: HeLlOoO it starred me!! It’s okay: to err is human; to forgive divine. Second of all, my plays and my genius are a gift and work of art. I can not even attempt to picture estimating and labeling a price for them. Cold, dead presidents (money) is not something that I (I wanted to make that capitalized, but it already is) will sell my soul to; no matter how tempting it can be.  Amina: Of course you won’t sell your soul: my dear teezacup (teeza is butt in Arabic :D) I wouldn’t want you to do that. I didn’t ask you to sell your soul. I couldn’t ask you to do that. Okay, enough of the bull. Are you sure that there is no way I can’t convince you to do it? To sell your soul? To get rid of it? Please, it’s for humanity. It’s for the better cause. It’s for the good of Rome. Hhahahha Caesar has fried my brain. Or should that be Brutus and Cassius have fried my brain, since Caesar was dead. Nope, wrong again. Shakespeare has fried my brain. Oh wait, that’s still wrong. Of course they didn’t fry my brain. You see my brain is, just, well a miracle. It’s so big and full of knowledge. Enough modesty: time to brag. My brain is huge. It’s loaded. It’s awesome, and the whole world wants it because they all know that I have the biggest weapon when it comes to mass destruction. I’ve got my calculating, intelligent, cunning, amazing, and mind boggling brain. Get it? Mind boggling?! Hahahahaha  Mariam: Zakhroota at the amount of bul* you are able to make up in very few seconds; at the most imaginative lies one could write. But I shan’t give your tiny brain, another moment of my precious time. I have more important matters to discus: a toe that has a freckle, the freckle is brown…does this mean that the toe must have a brown spot? Confusing right. Allow me to make it easier; it’s the pinky toe; the one the little piglet got stuck, crying, and couldn’t find his way home. That’s the toe.  Amina: you must be quite familiar with the little piggys. How do you spell the plural of piggys? I don’t want pigs, I want piggys. It keeps marking it wrong. Oh well. Anyways, I was incorrect in writing that you are quite familiar with little piggys. I should have written that you are familiar with all piggys. And don’t you dare call me a piggy, I know the way your sick brain works, Mariam.  Mariam: It shames me to dishonour my beautiful, honorable, held high, name by allowing you to write your name next to mine. (To pplz who are having difficulty keeping up with our influential corespondance, I urge you to get a translator to translate our exceptional, genius language into your idiocy. People of your slow capabilities can’t do this by yourself)  Amina: you know what would be really sad, (you’re right. Your name shouldn’t be anywhere near mine, but for the opposite reason) if our soul mates somehow read this blog and find out that we are insane. Years later we catch up with them; they are exactly as we would want them to be, and we agree to get married, until they realize that we are the proud owners of this blog. Then they run like heaven (why is it hell?!) away from us, and we never get to marry our soul mates. All because of this blog.   It’s too much. We can not continue. I urge you Mariam to take into consideration your future and leave this blog to be.   Mariam: Oh, Amina. The minute my future husband (insha Allah) discovers you are my sister, I am a goner. (Don’t even think about saying it’s because he’d fall in love with you). I don’t blame him; I only put up with you because you’re family…there is no reason he should have to put himself in such a horrible situation. And I have a clue why its h-e- double hockey sticks/heaven. (but I won’t tell you…like a wise person once said “Knowledge is the waterwheel that soaks up information, turns it around, and absorbs all that is logical and correct.”  THE END OF OUR CHAT FOR NOW. (in case you didn’t know, mariam ended it…which means she won!!)   Amina: “ Bullshit, is what the bull excels at. Shit is what Mariam excels at.” Hey, guess what? That’s my quote :D :D :D :D   * we’re going now, just wanted to tell Sara A. we love you :D :D
