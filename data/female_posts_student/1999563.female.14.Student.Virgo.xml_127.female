Seriously, it makes my day to much better when I know I get to see Laura's cute face  I just thought I would let you know I love you sooo much...tha nks for always listening   I wuv you Shannon!!   One time, like 2 years ago, at camp this girl said to me, "You wear makeup? I thought you were naturally beautiful!"  Now that I think about it, it isn't as nice as I thought it was..but still! :)   I just got back form bibl study, it was fun :)  Yup..thats all I did today.
