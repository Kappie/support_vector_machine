It completely died several weeks ago, and is now to be returned to me with a brand-new hard drive, and a new monitor, but sans any files that I had saved on it.  To me, this combination equals 'new computer.'  Kind of exciting!  Also kind of sad, as I mourn the passing of my faithful companion of my first two years of medical school.    So.  Not terribly long after my Fourth Real Page, I had to use the facilities.  In the process, I managed to drop my pager...in the toilet.  (Thankfully after I'd flushed)  As I stood there pondering the age old pager-in-the-toilet dilemma, I realized that this was an automatic motion-sensing toilet.  Now, these things never work for me at the  urlLink apropos  time.  However, when I have a pager sitting in the bottom of the toilet, it decides to conveniently start working, forcing me to plunge my hand into the bowl to rescue said pager.  Good grief.  I don't even like the thing, but I just couldn't let it come to such an end.  Not yet, anyway.  Maybe at the end of fourth year...  Just in case you were curious: pagers don't swim.  So, now I'm pager-less until Wednesday, when the 'pager person' is in from 11-2.  In case you were curious, I know say "Wednesday" like I'm from the south, which means it has about 27 syllables.  It's kind of fun - you should definitely try it.  Repeat after me: Weh-uns-d-ah-ay.   In other news: 1. A  urlLink new dinosaur species  was discovered in Montana.  The interesting thing about  Suuwassea emilieae  is that it has a 'mysterious'extra hole in its skull.  I'm thinking that may be why the poor thing went extinct.  Hole in head does not lend itself to survival, in my humble opinion.  2. I don't know how I missed this: Andy Kaufman is alive and well, and is  urlLink blogging  right here on blogspot.  Hmmm.  Or  urlLink  is he?   The  urlLink debate  continues.   Personally, I would have to ask: why on  earth  would Andy Kaufman start a blog?  I prefer to think he'd be off with Elvis having a grand old party.  3. A certain female in our class (whose name has a paucity of syllables and vowels) is sporting a rather large diamond on a rather prominent finger.  And talks with her hands a lot.  This may be a 'daddy-loves-me-oh-so-much' ring, but I don't know...  4. I get my root canal tomorrow!  Saints be praised!  I never thought I'd be looking forward to it, but I'm ready to get this stinking sedative filling out.
