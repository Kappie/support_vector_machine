Katy...if you're checking this, we're not going to Genetech, so it's probably going to be pickup from the Graduate. I have to have a written note from the parents, though, lol...or so Dr. Pomeroy says. Hope you're having fun.  Rejection isn't fun, on the other hand. No, not so much rejection. More like resignation. I think of that episode of the last season of Sex and the City where Mr. Big gets that operation and opens his heart up to Carrie, only to close it again. I didn't realize it was open--or at least as open as I could ever wish it could be. No, it's not rejection. It's just not being savvy enough to realize that that was probably the best time I could ever have and not taking advantage of it. What I would give to live those moments again, to make more of it!  For some reason, I just want to attach something lovely to that first kiss. I don't want to look back years later and remember that it was but a momentary fling. I wanted it to be something serious and something true and something real. And then I think, it was there, what more could I ask for?  So I thought I was in love and now, out of it, I realize truly how out of it I am. A is just A once again, the guy who's still doing his math hw during practice, who's kind of lost somewhere out there. I just wonder what happened between crush for a year and daring to kiss and just there now. I was right, though. I never deserved someone like that and it was just a fancy, and just for one night. Is that what guys will do when they're asked to be nice, though? Or was it something more?  But I miss it.  So mock trial hell begins soon, and I'm just waiting for it to take over my life. I have too much to do at this time of year, and I'll just savor the moments before the avalanche.  Charles, stop being gay.
