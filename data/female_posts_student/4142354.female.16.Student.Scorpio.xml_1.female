But Amy and her brother missed their flight sending all our prior plans into a mass chaotic mess. To make a long story short a few people left and we knew where they were going and just didn’t want to go and then some other people played a little game called "Let’s ditch Rebecca and Morgan and see how upset they get." Well we were upset, very upset. So we watched "Tuck Everlasting."
