AND ALL THE CHEESE IS REALLY GETTING TO ME! (if you know what i mean, then you know what i mean).  enough is enough! and i'm going to break the damn ornament and that is getting to me too.... i love buying gifts for those i love. i hate it when love is over too. i hate that! how can something like that end, it doesnt' make sense! how can that just go away???  but i guess it does. stupid love. stupid kinkos. stuipd interview. stuipd no place to live. stupid summer. stupid school. stupid exam. stupid SCANNER. stupid stupid stupid scanner. stupid windows. stupid mp3 player. stupid one bedroom apartments i can't afford. stupid dishes. stupid laundry in the corner i won't put away. stupid diploma sitting on the floor that has done crap for me. stupid pens and pencils that don't work in my tin. stupid ice cream. stupid pink shirt. stupid hip flexer muscle that hurts. stupid allergies. stupid Negative people that piss me off. stupid scanner. stupid scanner. stupid scanner.  sorry. :(
