But what I did do was very produtive (it just depends on how you look at them). Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I'm not sure if my mother is calling me or not, if she i s  I don't care. I'm ignoring her.       Beth is haveing fun, that's good at least. I'll just keep saying that. ha. Well Fraser is up to about nine pages or something. Somewhere around there. I still have to do about four or five pages. gaa. that'll be an isue, I'm looking forward to it and not. I like writing but i'm in a bit of pain.       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh. Mom bought another useless item today a toothbrush holder for the down stairs washroom. Not only do mom and I, and a couple of other people own electric tooth brushes, but the regulare ones that we own wouldn't fit in the wholes. They are made for people whos hands get uncomfortable when they brush their teeth. You know my hands always get horrid rashes when I brush   my   teeth. I just   have   to be entirly comfortable when brushing my teeth or I'll spontaniously combust. You know it's true.
