Michelle and I went to Pinball Petes and played DDR and pool before getting out usual Starbucks and heading out.  Day Two: The Picnic. Senior Skip Day was today, the seniors had a picnic down at Loonfeather Park. Met up with Andrea and Chloe. Talked a shitload before getting a page from Q. We went out to Q's house but he wasn't home and Ryan wouldn't answer the door, so we left.  Day Three: The Tornado. We came back to my neighborhood and chilled at the park at about 2:10, so I could smoke a cigarette before heading to the mall.  "Damn, those clouds look menacing." "Yeah... It's like a sunset or something. All dark over there but bright as hell in that direction." "Hey look, it's turning green." *Ashley's Cell Phone Rings* "Hello." "Hey, it's Josh, you might want to go home and stay there for awhile. I don't know where you're at right now, but you might want to find some shelter." "Okay, bye." We quickly drove to my house as the wind picked up. I wasn't too scared up until the clouds starting passing by as fast as the cars that passed us down the street. We sat in my car for awhile, and then decided to head inside when the wind got worse. I didn't think my mother was home, so I went looking for my grandfather. I was screaming his name and then I heard the dog barking from what seemed like outside. I ran to the back door and almost got blown away yelling for my dog to come inside. My mom finally yelled my name and then told us to come down into the basement. I stayed there for awhile, but then decided to go and find my cat. Sonya was sitting pretty chill in my room, so Michelle and I got the cat carrier, but as soon as I picked the cat up she pissed all over me. It was hilarious but pissed me off. I ran into the basement just as my mom yell, "forget the cat!" But I ended up taking her anyway. I think she's still angry about the whole thing (my cat of course). After everything pretty much blew over, I went back upstairs to change and called a few people. Josh was driving back from Arby's, examining the damage done to our little town. I invited him over so he'd have a place to hang in case another wave was to hit. Apparently the next wave is coming tonight.  Day Four: The Mall. I took my mom to her alergist to get her injection. Michelle and I chain smoked a cigarette in my car like little 15-year-olds or something, before my mom came back out to the car. "I need to put something in my mouth." lol. I'm such a dork sometimes. We then went to the mall for our little shopping spree. My mom's car isn't fixed yet, so she's not leaving for WI until Tuesday. That sucks. I bought a lot of clothing and two new pairs of shoes. Fun shit. Michelle and I the headed to Makara for dinner after dropping my mom off at Louis Cafe. We had the biggest dinner in the world. I still feel like I'm going to puke from eating so much.  And now I shall make a fifth day out of my 24 hours by hanging out with someone, anyone, tonight.  Tomorrow's events will hopefully go smoothly. Nick's coming down for sushi and Starbucks. Then we're having the party at Mike's. Hopefully. That or things will be moved to my house.  Mom, Dad, don't ask questions....
