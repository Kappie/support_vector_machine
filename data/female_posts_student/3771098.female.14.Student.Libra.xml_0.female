Then i had to go eat lunch with the g-parents all the way out in the middle of nowhere in this like dump of a place where they had a barbeque bar thing.  make any sense?  It didn't to me.  So then i went to pick up concealer from clinique and i got a free gift (yay!).  Then i went to claires and got some matching earings and necklaces for my cousins and I.  After that it was off to Tarjay cuz i mean you can never leave for a trip without going to tarjay.  then i got my hair stuff and went home.  Well when i got home i checked out my makeup and it turns out that the clinique lady gave me the wrong shade of concealer.  I told my dad to go and exchange it cuz i had to babysit at 6 and i didn't have time to go myself.  I wrote him a note, layed the bag out on the counter and everything.  Well i get home and guess who didn't go to the store to exchange liz's concealer??  Mi Padre.  That's who.  So i guess i'll be buying concelaer in denver tomorrow.  Fun.  Well I got to see amez and hear all her wacky stories about L-ridge then i had to run home to leave to go babysit.  I swear that's like all i do now.  No job, no car, everyone's out of town.  Irmo just generally sucks right now.  So I leave for denver tomorrow.  You'd think, awsome, denver, great city to ski in.  Well i'm going in august so no skiing, and i'm visiting family.  Oh by the way, it's just me and my brother flying out by ourselves and I swear if i see one dude in a turban on my plane i'm getting the hell outa there.  No prejudice, just common sense people.  I really don't want to go.  I'll get back on the 8th and then school starts on the 9th.  Great timing.  I still have to get the rest of my school supplies, a bookbag, and some new clothes and shoes.  When am i gonna' have time????  Oh yeh, they've got stuff planned out too.  Like we're hiking and going to a water park and swimming and up to the mountains (i kinda' thought we were already in the mountains but i guess not) and all this stuff.  While that's great and all, and i sorta kinda like being outdoors, i'm telling you guys, i'm gonna' like pass out or something cuz unlike them, i'm outa' shape.  That's just the way it is.  So there better be some majorly hot guys up there cuz if there aren't i think i'm gonna' go crazy.  No lie.  I mean how would you like it if you got shipped out to like a different region of the country to be with your 9, 7, and 5 year old cousins?  You wouldn't.  Gosh.  And then schools starting soon and i haven't finished my requried book, and i still have to rent les mis cuz news flash people, i refuse to read another book.  And get this, everyone is gone the week i'm here and then i leave when everyone comes back.  So i'm just gonna' take advantage of having free roaming nationwide or whatever you call it and  just chat on the phone the whole time i'm gone.  oh yeh, and then there's this 3 hour time difference.  How nice is that?  My flight leaves at 12:30 and i arrive in denver at 1:30 or something, cept it'll feel like 4:30.  Nice.  No comprendo my schedule.  I swear, next summer is gonna' be crazy.  I've gotta do the msision trip thing, the partners program, somewhere in there i've gotta go on a family vacation, maybe a job, and all this other crap.  Oh guess what!?!  I was talking to my dad about going on a cruise and brining amez and hopefully/probably we'll get our own adjoining room which is off the chain and means that if we have a cerfew of like midnight, well come in, "go to sleep" and then leave again.  i mean how awsome is that.  I will have a muy bueno time.  Hehehehe.  Well mi madre and i got in a fight like yesterday i guess but before that we were in the car and she was yelling at me about how i dress.  My response was "well at least i'm not sleeping with people like just about everyone else i know".   That shut her up pretty quick.  So for once, we've come to an agreement.  Since i'm not having sex (yes i am a virgin and i'm proud of it)  she doesn't have any reason to yell at me about how i dress.  I'm liking this agreement.  Well that's about it people.  Maybe i'll run into some hot guy on the plane....haha-  well that's about it folks.  I'll talk to ya'll in a week!  Call if ya want.  I'm gonna go crazy out in denver.  Love ya!  Liz
