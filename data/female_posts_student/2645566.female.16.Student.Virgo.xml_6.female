I have a wonderful boyfriend, but I don't get to see him due to the fact that he lives in Manchester. It costs a little too much for us to drive 20 miles every day so we can see each other. So that leaves barely any options for the afternoon. Spend time with friends, do homework, come home. That's what I usually do but you can only do that so much. I find myself devouring my time with books and stories (usually stupid little things that will not benefit my being at all). Maybe leaving for mid-state on Thursday will have a positive effect on me. At least I will be spending time with different people from all over middle Tennessee. I vow to make the most out of Thursday, Friday and Saturday...my midstate experiance for this year. Now I will just go off and read...hoping for time to hurry and pass along so I can see Paul tomorrow. Then I'm off....
