You see, he's one of those Beautiful People, and he fully doesn't sit in front of the mirror in order to achieve that. He just IS...and then there's me. Jaded. Freakish. Wierd. You know who I am. I don't blame him for not loving someone like that. Maybe I'm making excuses. I'm just telling myself that it wouldn't have worked out in order to make myself feel OK for not doing anything. I don't know what I'm doing........ Is it wierd to miss someone U barely know? Is it wierd to want to kiss that person? Is it wierd for that person to appear in almost all of your dreams? He usually is just some inconspicuous person that walks by and smiles. Sometimes He says something. I can never remember what. Sometimes we kiss. Those are the times that I don't really want to wake up but maybe that's what I need to do...Wake Up.
