So far I've seen Sweet November, The Hulk, Matchstick Men, Underworld, Mystery Men, Mona Lisa Smile, and Sylvia.  Sweet November and Mona Lisa Smile were excellent.  Those and Sylvia were my mother's choices.  My father chose Matchstick Men (I didn't like it.  I found the end sort of disturbing to my mind).  Underworld and Mystery Men were my choice.  Underworld is probably the best movie out of all of them.  It was sooooo good!!!  I watched it again and again.  Wonderful effects and acting!!  Mystery Men was very funny too.  I didn't really like The Hulk though (my brother's choice).  So far, we've bought two video games for GBA SP.  The Sims and Onimusha Tactics.  I've been having my eyes on a new Harvest Moon game I've been lusting for for a long time.  Hmm...wonder if I have saved up enough money to buy it as I haven't seen it in Canada yet.  It's very warm down here.  ^_^ I can finally wear my t-shirts.  Well, see you all!  Keep in touch!
