The newspaper, citing U.S. intelligence officials, said al-Qaida would target an American or foreign leader either within the United States or abroad.   Let me repeat the key words for you.  Target an  American  OR  foreign leader  EITHER within the  United States  OR  abroad .  Well. That clarifies a lot, doesn't it. Could we be anymore vague? Hasn't this  been  the threat?   I do believe so.  At first, I thought this broad generalization was simply the result of dim witted local  urlLink newscasters .   I kept waiting for the interviewer to cut off the anchor man and ask "In your dreams, do the skeletal dead ever push through the dirt and claw at your shins, their fleshless faces leering in glee and pain?"  Perhaps that happened in the last half.   But, alas, I've come to discover this awesome dialogue came straight from the award winning journalism of this country's  urlLink  national  news leaders.  Great reporting, guys. Just great.
