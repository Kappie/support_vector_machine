I got a lot of stuff on my mind (like most) but I thought maybe I could go on and do a little venting.  So, if you have a password or code or whatever, please IM it to me or blog it?  Thanks.  Btw, what happened tonight?  Sorry I couldn't go out but I feel a little too tired and I'm really not digging hanging out.  Reason, I feel like this group communicates through journals, AIM, and blogger too much.  I don't really care, but I'm tired of going out and not talking about anything!!!  But, i can go on and read some journal and BOOM I'm done...  It erks me.  sorry, folks, billy needs a breather.
