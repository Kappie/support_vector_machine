Just coz some ppl dont hang out in big groups and appears to enjoy being by themselves doesnt make them a total loser. I mean we all have our own world, we all care about ourselves the most, we have our own secrets no one knows, and we tell ourselve things. We just stand in popular big clicks to put on an image to others when deep down .. ure a loner and u have no friends. But thing is.. what IS wrong with beign a loner besides the images of lookin cool? .... not that IM a loner....
