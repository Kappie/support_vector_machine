And from my window, I can see two strange lookin guys running up our driveway, up the stairs and loudy banging on the door and ringing the doorbell maniacally!  Normally, if I hear a doorbell or knocking, I just run up and open the door.  I don't know what, but something stopped me.  I was standing DEAD STILL in the hallway, hoping they wouldn't see from either windows...  I can say I've never felt that scared of being home alone.  Just when I think it is safe to go to the window and check if they're gone... I hear them running up again.  They ring the doorbell, pound, then leave.   ...Just a thought>We should get a peep-hole on our door...   Happy list: 1)Adam sleeping on the table... awww, how cute. 2)Fitz let me hold his glasses!!! LoL (inside joke) 3)I FINALLY met Gnome today on my bus stop...
