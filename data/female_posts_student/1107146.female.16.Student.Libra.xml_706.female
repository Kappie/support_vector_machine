Ok so...in lieu of recent mysticism, I'm making a rule that you can't have trailing, non-sequeter sentences anymore, unless you absolutely want to clue us in that you are having a problem and want to talk about it, just not on the BLog. Other than that, no more "So about that 21 year old guy.........."s and "Males are evil. I hate them."s and "There's something about how similar chicken and corn dogs are....."s. Except for that last one, all have happened lately! So, thus!  Because I am so cool I hereby do establish the   NON NON-SEQUITER RULE     Amen. And have lots of fun trying to find ways to violate it.  And as a first violation to this rule, please support Linds in this, her hour of greatest need...yeh not really, but that's just a fruckin' awesome segway into the aftermath of that statement.
