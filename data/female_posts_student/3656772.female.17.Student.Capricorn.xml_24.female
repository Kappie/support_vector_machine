(I’m guessing Sam won’t be reading this…) I’m having fun out here in New Jersey, we’ve been fishing a lot, and I’ve caught some gargantuan fish….hehe …that’s a weird word…gar~gan~tu~an… *groan* I lost my sunglasses, and my head is eating me alive…..stupid headaches from sun are the worst. Blue fish taste really good, especially when you catch them yourself and they are really fresh. Yummmm. We went out fluking (fluke is a kind of flat fish, they taste pretty good, but most of them are too small, you can only keep a certain size) and while we were fishing the whaler (a kind of boat) kept making this annoying beeeeeeeeeeeeeee~ing sound, and it wouldn’t fucking knock it off….it goes off when the motor is getting over heated, and we thought we got it to work, but a while later it started up again just as we were about to go out on the ocean! (can you imagine how much it woulda sucked if we were out on the ocean and the engine died? Bummer~uhm~Jim…;) ) So anyways, we went back to Uncle Don’s house and swam in the pool the whole rest of the day with Donnie (my cousin), Tim, and Donnie’s friend Katy (she’s really nice) and she’s inclusive, unlikewhenI feel like Donnie hates being around me.... . Tim taught me how to play ping-pong, I suck massively, but I was getting better. He is spastically good at pool too!!! We need to go to your grandmother’s house and play, and jump on the tramp and eat ham and drink sobe tea. So now I’m recovering from my head ache and looking out at the sail boat races on the river. You would love it here, I know it. It’s warm too ;). How is the weather out there? Good I hope? I keep looking at the weather for New York on the TV, but I’m not really sure where Buffalo is… I’ve been having issues getting on the internet…but I’m doing my best to get on. I have about ten min at a time, and I can never finish what I want to do! So it’s taken me about three days to get the rp post up *rolls her eyes*, just a little frustrating. Well, I’m thinking about you!!! Have you been motorcycling much yet?And have you gone to that one place with the buffalo wings yet?? I miss and love you!!! If you talk to sam on the email, tell her I love her and miss her a lot, and I can’t email her back because I’m having such trouble getting access to the internet.    It’s very peaceful too, we’re listening to this calming music, relaxing, its not any sort of a rush-around atmosphere like during school. I’m going to miss summer again I know. We have to play our video games, jezz we haven’t gotten anywhere on it. Tim rented this game called Drakenguard, it looks really fun, I think we should play it some time.    We’re prolly going to go up to NY and see a Broadway play! It sounds kindof fun to me…I wish I could see Victor Victoria. If you ever need to get me a gift, I’d love to have a DVD or VHS of it.  Pop-pop slow dances with me *Grin* ; ) It’s fun, he’s really good. Well I suppose I ought to go do some homework or some odd thing….*rolls her eyes* how about not….you enjoying our reading or anything? Ah, well I miss you.    We are close in heart,  Step
