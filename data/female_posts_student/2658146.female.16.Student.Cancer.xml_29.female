The whole time we were talking I kept dropping "I love you"'s all over the place and even hid a few in some screenshots of my desktop that I sent him. And he had no reaction to them. Sorry if I'm being selfish, but I feel neglected since he doesn't show his love for me as often as I show my love for him. He apologize for last night, but that doesn't change the fact that I feel unwanted. Who can blame me? Here I am trying to show him how much I care (he keeps saying I don't show it often enough around him) and he does nothing for me. And when he talked to me again this afternoon, he said he wanted to stop hugging me and stuff around Pa because "he will get to know pa better that way." I understand that Pa might not like us doing that in front of him (it's just a hug anyway, and he has yet to say anything to me about it), but Pa already likes Dave and I don't think it will make much more of a difference. Way to make me feel more neglected. I need to go out Wednesday before I explode. It was just "lovely" that Dave had to make sure he left with me feeling very very alone. Maybe I'm meant to be alone. Ever since I started to pray for his safety down in Vegas, his situation has been getting smidgens better and mine getting worse. I guess God wants to protect him from me since I'm an awful sinning Christian who doesn't read the Bible or pray often enough. He doesn't deserve someone as terrible as me. I guess that's why I get treated the way I do. I have a feeling that our relationship is going to spiral downwards when he gets back. I hope not, but I have this gut intuition that it will. Maybe his lack of attention-giving to me is what draws me towards the who, since the who is a very cuddly touchy lovey person. I wish I knew what the hell is going on with me.  I feel so very alone...   Current Mood:  Turned Away
