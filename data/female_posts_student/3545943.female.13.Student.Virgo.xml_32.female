And then you start to wonder if you've only built up trust because you haven't been observant enough to notice what would kill it.  But can you ever fully trust anyone but yourself?  What is trust?  Truth is a big part of it.  Does trust mean telling each other the truth, no matter what?  But brilliant minds such as Machiavelli contend that it is not always necessary, nor even good to be truthful.  If you lie to protect someone, may that shatter trust?  And what of love?  What brings you to care so much about someone that the love remains even through broken trust?  Looking at Machiavelli again, he insists that the ends justify the means.  But it takes more force to begin a motion than to continue it.  Love too can be shattered easily.  But then, what is love?  And in love, what is peace?  There is no black and white.  Only darker and lighter shades of grey.  There is no good, no evil.  It's all in the eye of the beholder.  It's a huge mishmash of grey.  The world is not our perfectly balanced black/white, male/female, yin/yang that we believe it to be, or wish it were.  But I digress; is trust a good thing?  Is it necessary?  Perhaps we ought to all live for ourselves solely, but then to quote Thomas Hobbes, "No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death: and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."  Ah, perhaps we are all the cruel joke of some creator.
