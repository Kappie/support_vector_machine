Say for instance those little tiny things that make us happy each day... So... I was thinking I should list at least 3 things that made me happy each day. Here's 3 for today: 1)Tim got me funky lookin' glasses 2)Chinese convenience-store guy 3)Guitar teacher...really cool guy...  I'm actually planning on listing these things everyday--that way, I could learn to appreciate those little tiny things that people often times pass by and aren't able to see the beauty of life!  Make it a good day!
