"why is that your friends can see how beautiful you are inside and out, but you cant?" its not that simple. i guess i'm just not strong like you people.  god...why is it that we let ourselves be bohtered by what other people think and do? i read in   BODY ELECTRIC by CAMY BAKER     "as we become young adults on our way to becoming women[and men], we'll be faced with many people-friends, boyfriends, parents, teachers, actors, models, songers- who will influence and inspire us in many ways. these people will influence what we wear, how we act, and even how we feel.
