Now I realized I really cannot fail this sem. If fail then really Hong Gan liao. Choy Choy! God will bless me. I will try to be a good girl. *MeOwWww*  The past few weeks hadn't been very smooth sailing...only just a few days ago. Well, like I said, I'm jinxed in a way. Hahah....trials and tribulations like to come to me in peristaltic waves.   Well, perhaps that's God's way of telling me that I shouldnt reschedule my interview that day to wed afternoon just so I can go mambo. Hiakz. Well I supp to have an interview with this company (shall that mention that bloody name or else it will be so disgusting that my com will hang) on thursday morning and I changed it to wed afternoon cos I wanted to go zouk on wed nite and I was afraid I can't wake up in time for it. Well, billions of banacles, I then just received news that I had ANOTHER inerview on wed afternoon at 3.30pm which is at eunos and the one that was at 4pm was in town. FREAK. Talking abt COINCIDENCE. Well, made a farked up mistake telling the co. at 3.30pm slot that I had a interview with another co. at 4pm(Damn) and can't make it down for my 3.30pm slot. Guess they weren't too pleased...sighz  THen it had to rain. I din have my umbrella and I was wearing one of the few times in my life a long sleeve shirt and pants with KILLER heels( really, I had 7 plasters on both feet in total cos of the damnit shoes). Then, best. MY HEEL BROKE...WOOHOO. And then another spam of bad news was, my contact lens on the right eye fell off. How sway can one be man? Tsk. Anyway, when I thought God had mercy on me for the interview I was so wrong. I was so bombed and so dishellved tat I was crying right after the interview walking in the rain.   And my bf chose to argue with me abt my character then that nite on my way to mambo for the next 1-2 hours and then with both hanging up the fone in a totally exasperated mode. THat nite, I was crying all nite as I was dancing at the podium.   Then, the next day, I called the co. up and ask for a chance of a 2nd interview for the slot I missed from ytd's 3.30pm slot. And she told me...SORRY, WE AREN'T ACCEPTING ANYMORE INTERVIEWS.   *deafening silence*  Eh, dun ask me how I felt. Cos I dunno. But then, I can tell u, it's NOT the first time I kena such shit. And I'm still taking it.  Then later in the day, my wallet fell out in the bus and although thankfully I din leave my ic and visa inside, my cash was stolen though my wallet returned to me.   And later that day, me and bf argued very badly again. He kept telling me how prideful I was, how defensive in reflex I always get and having to be submissive and all that then. All I though was.. I'm in such a shit emotional ride now and this has to happen. Am I really the result of all these predicaments that HAS to happen now? Despite all the ranting exasperations then inside me. I kept quiet and tried to discuss in the most calm way I could. Sometimes I really do get amaze at how much tolerance and endurance to certain situations I have inside me. Well... argument aside I guess a part of me was to be blamed for his outburst and I have to reflect upon myself but I guess it was a totally off timing to discuss it when i'm in an epidemic of catastrohpic mishaps(hhaha!). Was just thinking why din he discuss this when I was feeling slightly better..oh well...what happen has happen and it dawn on me suddenly as God said softly to me that nothing in this world will ever go according to what u wan. U can wish that u had done this, or that, wished he could have been this and that but ultimately, what happens if it doesnt occur the way I wan it? Do I sit and cry and lament and get into that self pity mode again? That was then...suddenly after a decade of being in so much self misery, I realised I am going to shove it back. I can't stop all the bad things from happening at once but I can stop myself from getting myself too caught up in it and think of them as a bad experience.   I still believe in God. I believed still He had a reason for making me go through these even in the midst of all these I never blamed God. Just disappointed. But He showed me the silver lining so soon after all these cos after that I got another chance to get interviewed with the other co. and I was accepted on the spot RIGHT AWAY. Everything seemed to get so much better after that. These few weeks have taught me what kind of person I really am, where I should start changing myself at a pt where I will stop self degradation. I thank my bf though for that time telling me to be more positive rather than thinking persimistically (but he was quite harsh in his tone though..) just hope God will continue to open my eyes to more ways on how to deal with my lifestyle better.   Ok, I have no more complaints for now liao. I got a loving family, a doting bf ( he just bought me a inouvi blusher today..so sweeeeet!) and I got my place for internship. I felt so blessed.   Oh, I'm gg to Brisbane with my classmates on the 24th of May too! I'm soOoOo elated for now. Hehe.   ok lah, got to go and study abit liao..sighz.. laterzz
