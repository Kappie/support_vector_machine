I don't know about the Shawn thingy,   but i am gonna ask Taylor if she likes him tomorrow, kay.!. Oh yeah I think i know who Samantha likes, but i don't   want to put it on here so call me if you want me to tell you!!! I saw Samantha and Meredith at   Wal- Mart. Last night was so funny because at like 11:00pm my mom, Laurie, Heather, Shellie, and me all went to wal-mart, and guess who we saw.?.?.?. It was hilarious, Gage was wearing these neon shoes,   and he had to keep walking through the thingys to see if he was stealing anything or whatever.   And they kept going off so we were all cracking up, be-cuz he had to take off his jacket, his shirt, and sumthin' out of his pocket   before he realized that it was his shoes. Well N*E*wayz you should have been there.!.!.!. Well c yah soon!!      I       â™¥     Matthew     **     Kevin!!!!      -   A s h l e y
