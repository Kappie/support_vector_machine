WoW.. this weekend started off aMaZiNg.. and now it suddenly BLOWS!!! we'll just start with the amazing part.. that part doesn't last long- don't worry. Thursday night me and brittany chilled for a while once she got off of work.. we met up with baker, charlie, crask, kyle, and chandler.. we went to baker's for a while.. that's all in my last blog.. we spent a lot of time with brenton and matt this weekend. we got to hang out with neil and steve.. we hung out with will a. and michael p. too.. i bumped into kelsey (cousin) - i havent seen her in a long long time- and molly.. we saw matt b., kameron b., and johnny g. too! saw chris and michael b. and charlie again.. then spent some more time with matt and brenton.. watched like 500 movies... got in a hot tub (that didn't last long, haha) .. we went and saw chad m., jessi b., and cole m. ... a very very very strange thing for me to have allowed myself to do.. some things just don't seem like they go together quite well... but its whatever.... so yeah yeah yeah~ to all yall my weekend might not sound all that *gRaNd*FrEaKiN*TaSTiC* but it really was SoO+ much fun! last night me and brittany chilled a while and i felt like complete cRaP.. like .. throwin up blood... yeah its sick but that's what happened. brit pulled over so i could like catch my breath and then we started goin again right.. okay well bLuE LiGhTs ArE a BiTcH!!! we got pulled over b/c we "looked suspicious" b/c we only paused for a min and then started goin again and he just happened to drive by in the time we parked.. he ran a check on brit's license and then let us go.. i mean what else could he do? we didn't do anything wrong so he couldn't exactly arrest us.. i mean come on?! that sucked reallly reallly reallly bad.. but that's not even the beginning of what ruined my weekend!! oohh!~ and get this. i fell down some stairs haha.. but i gotta admit it really was funny as anything.. like i didn't fall down.. i just missed one step and that made me miss about 15 more haha.. my right arm scraped the banister thing on the side and i was bleeding... it looked like i tried to slit my wrists and only did one... it still looks kinda rough but oh well.. it was my own fault... but that's still nothing compared to all the crap that went on this weekend... i'd love to share all the b/s details with yall but i am not allowed to.. and neither is the only other person who knows.. i made some sucky decisions and let's just say they caught up with me... bad. i'd take it back if i could... but i can't so there goes that idea. i am kinda grounded but kinda not.. which is a major first.. ive never gotten in trouble for like anything before.. i'm still not really in trouble.. b/c my daddy doesn't know the whole spill. my mom kinda like put me on probation i guess u could say... it's very strange.. and i could prolly get in trouble for talkin bout all this.. but its a risk i am obviously willing to take. i could go ahead and spill the beans n just spill em everywhere but i know CeRtAiN ppl still read this.. and those certain ppl couldn't keep a secret even if it was a life or death type deal... oh well.. anyway. i went to church this morning.. i couldnt go to the confirmation so i went to my church and i couldn't sit through it.. i felt so sick so my mom let me go sleep in the car.. when we got home i slept until like 5:30 and then i called brittany and woke her up too. i went with my mom to raymond and to the movie place.. got some dvds for me n britt to watch tonight.. we may have some ppl here, not really sure yet.. on the way there, me and my mom weren't feeling very chatty so i had the radio goin ya know.. yeah, well i busted out in tears b/c of the songs that came on.. first "perfect" came on... but it was like the version w/o bass or something.. i teared up b/c it reminds me of a guy i know.. he dedicated it to his real daddy... (and i used to be in LOVE with that guy so it got to me a lil quicker).. so when that song went off.. i was like 'aw sad' or whatever.. then "The Reason" came on.. i was like what's the deal!?.. for those of you who didnt know, i cry almost every time i hear that song b/c it kinda describes a relationship i used to have with someone who was and still is very important to me whether they know it or not.. and whether i like it or not.. that will probably never change. after that "Here Without You" came on and i was like DeAr GoD.. i wanted to like shoot myself.. cuz it was mine n someone else's song... i was like screw it.. screw it all!!! but i mean seriosuly screw all that.. i still love all those people to death... i really really do.. but some things never change.. and some things HAVE to.. for better or worse this is how it all worked out. but i mean.. that's life. mine especially. its full of screw ups.. oopses.. regrets.. amazing moments.. and memories that never fade. some that you'd kill to forget and some you pray to God you never ever do. i sound like one of those lil "quote for the day" books... or a fortune cookie or something. God i should be shot. i really really should. this blog has jumped from one thing to the next.. sorry about that.. but its hard to help stuff like that when you have so much to say.. and so much you just can't... me and brit were talkin the other day and we decided that we really miss jarrod. he used to be our best best best friend.. and then it just stopped. it was sooo weird especially now that we're so close to matt and brenton again.. kinda odd but that's how it all worked out.. anyway... we decided we wanted to be friends with jdawg again.. but we didn't know how to go about it.. well he IMed brittany today... its progress at the very least! who knows.. maybe we'll al be best friends again. okay it is SO past time to shut up! i love yall so0o much and here's a quick tip.. think about the consequences of your actions before you just go and think you know all the answers.. before you do what you think is best.. it may seem great at the time but i promise it will come back to you.. ...No oNe kNoWs eVeRy tHiNg... *JuLie eLiSe cArGiLe*
