It was at that stage of growth where its all over the place, has no shape anymore and basically looks lost.  Actually, because I got this new guy at the old place, the price was a bit cheaper.  It was actually pretty funny.  I could tell he knew how to cut hair but didnt want to upset me by doing something wrong.  He was also fascinated by my hair.  Said I had great hair.  Actually about 3 people in the salon said that.  Aww.  It made me feel very special.  :-)  After the haircut, we went to see Kill Bill Vol. 2.  I was more than a bit disturbed by the S undertones (overtones?) it had.  Bill was Uma's "master" then gave her away to "serve" under another man and do his bidding?  Okay, so the guy was training her, but he was also torturing her.  It was all so  sick ...So very...  "Story of O" ... and I still to this day cant say whether or not I liked that book, nor can I say whether I liked the movie...yet.  I think it needs to marinate in me for awhile.   Diane and I were talking about it today and we both agree.  Its misogynistic, and yet, because the woman ends out on top in the end, it makes one  think  its not.  But how much shit does one woman have to go through, y'know?  I dunno... it just BOTHERED me.  But here's the best part of my day!!  Before the movie started I had to go to the bathroom.  So I get there, its empty, which seemed a little strange for a movie theater ladies bathroom, but whatever, no big whoop, I do my bidness... then I'm thinking... I know its been awhile since I've been in this theater, but I could have SWORN this bathroom was bigger.  Then I glance around my stall and I dont see the obligatory "sanitary napkin" can next to the toilet paper.  Then I flush, get up and start walking towards the sinks...when just then I notice it.  THEY WERE NOT SINKS BUT URINALS.  HEY, WAIT.  THAT WAS NOT A WOMAN WASHING HER HANDS BUT A MAN WHO JUST FINISHED PEEING AND OH, GOD, HOLY SHIT, I'M IN THE MENS ROOM!!!     The realization hit me in about .05 seconds and I dipped outta there before I think the man even noticed I was a girl!  HAHA  Thank GOD I didnt see his dingaling!    Anyone that knows me well, knows that when I have a destination, I have the blinders on, and its actually funny how it never happened to me years ago!  Its so classic that I would do this.  There have been times when I've walked right by my own husband on the street, with him waving his arms frantically and calling out my name!  HAHA    I went back to my seat cracking up, I tell Steve and what does he do? Shakes his head saying, "typical".  (see what I mean?)
