So today my dad said there were some Sprites in the trunk, if I wanted one (warm Sprite...gross, tho Sprite is pretty ass-bad, especially with popcorn!). I said no, that I had a Pepsi in the fridge and I was going to get it, since I'd remembered it. I drank it...I had a drum lesson, Katie went to hers and a lot of stuff got scrood up there (first we were too early, then we were too late, but she had the lesson anyway). But I eventually came home and DEAR GOD! The headache!  It feels like someone jammed a rusty knife up my nose into the left side of my brain, it's the worst I've ever had. So...  I think...  That's the end...  Of my caffeine drinking days...  YES I KNOW, IT'S REALLY REALLY WEIRD. What, me, master advocate of caffeinated beverages saying "Don't do legal over-the-counters, kids," But lordy, I shall never taste of this pain e'er again, so long as I shall live. So I give the brown stuff up.  Gunter was in our U.S. class yesterday, he came to say g'bye to Mrs. Bayrd last period, in case anyone really cares.  AND I'M AN OFFICE WORKER FOR MR. ADAMS! AWW W00t FRIKKIN' W00T! I get to grade all the little sophies essays and put comments like, "Gosh, r u dum, 0/9", and for all my little sophie buds (Trav-o, Jonathan, Sarah Heines), no matter what they put, I'll say "DAMMIT, i bow w/ supplication, 8107304912341/9". It's going to be great.  And for the essay in English today...what did you all argue? I said that it wasn't fair to blame the greater part of America for the lesser's sins.   Whateva. Peace bias.
