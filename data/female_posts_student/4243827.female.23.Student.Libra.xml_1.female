Today is just another great example of the degradation of the manner of the man. I haven't been home for several weeks and from the looks of things around here, the garbage hasn't moved the entire time I was gone. I live in a duplex shared by two gentlemen (term used  very  loosely). We all have to share one garbage cart that, on Tuesday, has to be moved to the curb. When I arrived home a few days ago our trash was all over the yard. No one had bothered to take the trash to the curb to be disposed of, and instead of pushing the trash down, they'd been piling it on top. So this evening I was outside cleaning. Our neighbor (whose cigarette and beer containers I was picking up), sat on the porch playing his guitar and watching me. As I struggle to contain his beer bottles and other loosely packed trash to move the container to the street, he rose to his feet... and went inside. I'm left to fight the garbage alone, which incidentally took me about ten minutes to get it to the curb while trying to keep my two-year old away from the street. Do any decent guys still exist? I'm quite certain none are jumping to take out my trash.
