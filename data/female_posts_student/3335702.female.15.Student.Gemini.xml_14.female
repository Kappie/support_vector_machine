Adam however, he's been really sweet to me. So I'm pretty into him. Dylan has been acting weirdly too, ever since I stopped talking to him, and got involved with Adam, he's become jealous or something. He told me how he wished he could hold me in his arms on the beach and all this really cute stuff. He said saying "I love you doesn't even describe how much I really do". It was amazing, he's so sweet. Ashley and Anna think he likes me. I'm not sure, I don't even care about this shit anymore, love is just terrible. I don't wanna think about it much, it sucks. Ellis is also apparently the drummer for our band, he's got places to practice and guitars and amps. This might actually turn into something big, I'm really excited. I bought the Taking back Sunday CD and the New Found Glory CD. I'm going to go listen to TBS, Ashley's on the phone.
