I liked him before, and i still do. Tomorrow we are going to Stone Mountain to see the laser show. Kayla and Drew ill be there. Im excited to see Kayla. AND I get to be with all my friends and see Mark. How great is that. Im sooo happy right now. I didnt think I could get this happy. Wow, i need something to calm me down.
