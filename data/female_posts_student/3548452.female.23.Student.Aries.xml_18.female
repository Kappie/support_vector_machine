Someone I considered a close friend chose to think with his dick instead of thinking with his brain- which must not be very smart at all if it would let him choose to think with his other organ. So now I have to deal with his woman and then becase she is an attention whore who likes to start drama, I have to deal with him when I try to shut her up. And he chose to listen to her side of the story instead of everybody else, so now I have to be labeled a bitch in his eyes and I'm the one tryin to "start shit." Nice. Anyhew, four more days till the wedding that I wish I could go see, but it wouldnt be a good idea. I could just see him trying to explain why I'm there. OH and let us not forget about David. David and I have been friends for 4 years and for some reason, everybody thinks its a bad idea that I try to date him. He's been in prison the last 2 years and was in and out of jail before that. He had an idiot for a girlfriend- who liked to thrive on drama and making up stories about people to make herself look good. If a guy said hi to her, he was tryin to "holla at her" so it was pointless to take her anywhere with me. I metDavid when I was 19. I saw him around a lot, but he worked and I worked, so we never spoke or hung out. Well a friend of mine made it known that I liked him. He came over one day and this drunk guy was at my house- I was trying to go to sleep but I couldnt with that guy there. I asked my friend Chrissy to take him home, she said no, so I looked at David and he said yes. Something kinda clicked then.He asked me to comesee him at work and we all ended up at his house.We all were partying- stayed at his housethat weekend (he wouldnt let me leave) and I had no idea he had a gf because she never called or came over. Things happened, but unfortunately were interrupted. Well, a couple days later he went to jail and I found out about Jill. I wrote him and told him that it couldnt happen again because I dont help people cheat... I'm not one for that. So we have been friends ever since. I write him when he's in jail, and I kept my distance when he was out because I didnt want to do anything to cause problems with him and his girlfriend. He respected that. I finally met her because I was calling her for him and somebody told her that he and I planned on sleeping together when he got out. People that didnt even know me at that. So I meet her, go to meet the people who are telling her all this, and these girls are girls who both slept with my cousin. The one immediately decides better of talking about me and when I let the other one know who I was, she decides the same. Jill and I kinda became friends- until I realized how silly this girl is. She thinks that because she's from Grand Blanc she's so wonderful and smart and pretty and it just is not true. Her attitude makes her the ugliest girl I've ever seen (and I should know- I like girls).She started giving me a headache everytime I hung out with her 'cause her attitude was just blah. She started telling me all the stuff David has done to her and how he's cheated on her and stuff. For someone to be dumb enough to stay with somebody if they treat them bad- no matter how much they claim to love you, it's still dumb. The more I got to know her, the more I understood why he treated her bad. Well then I started seeing how she was. She'sa slut- a nasty one at that. Doesnt like to use protection, sleeps with guys that you can just tell sleep with skanks, its no wonder she's with David- not to even be mean because he isnt the same as he was back then. She started telling me lie after lie after lie- you dont drive over to somebody's house the day you have surgery, no matter how minor it is. She started to irritate me the day she tried to tell me my own brother wanted her : yeah, right. He said she looked like a raccoon and he'd never do anything with her. I believe him- he doesnt have to lie to me, he's my brother. At that point, David was in jail again getting ready to go to prison... And I am here, seeing all the crap his girlfriend is putting him through. She told me she was pregnant (all of this while he was locked up- and I know for a fact that conjugal visits arent allowed AND that they are NOT married) then she had a miscarriage at like 5 months. Then she told me they got married, celebrated with a conjugal visit, and she got pregnant but she didnt know if it was his. Now she has these pictures of this kid that she says is his but all this time she doesnt know that I've been writing him and that he tells me everything. So I listen to lie after lie after lie- eventually she tells me he's out too and that they're having another baby. *rolls her eyes* stupid girls make me wanna puke on em. In the meanwhile I am still writing David and keeping him posted on his "girlfriend" and all her crap... In January he started asking about us... which was wierd. This year in January makes 4 years that I've known him. I dont know what changed, but in February he started asking about us and I told him that things could never progress because he was with Jill. Now,I"m really just confused as to why he's asking me about us since it seems he's still with Jill and still loves her or whatever. Well, I told him I hope I was still around and single when he finally ended up single. That moment has come quicker than I thought. He told me a couple weeks ago that he and Jill were breaking up- so I told him I'd be here for him when he got out. Now he tells me they are completely done, and asks me why I dont want to be with him. I know just by the fact that he's completely cut all ties from her that he's seriously thinking about what he wants to do and that it isnt drama. More than that, he knows me. He knows what I've gone through the past four years, he's been with me the whole time. He knows I'm not going to be down for any bullshit or drama, and I just told him what will happen if we leave the dating and being together option open. Once I love somebody, that's it. No if's ands or buts about it. So while I"m definitely not trying to be his girlfriend, if the situation presents itself.... who knows?
