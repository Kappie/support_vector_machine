How when you're alone you find yourself humming the tune. How it's amazing within 2 measly day you've managed to memorize the entire lyrics.  And how you download it and listen to it over and over again at 1am in the morning only because you don't listen to the radio and you have no other way of listening to it without having the evidence on you. So you download it anyways, but you keep hush about it and everytime someone turns to you and questions you about how much you like that song, you grimace and say "YUCK!" only because you're kiasu and you cannot be caught chimming and enjoying mediocre mass produced artificial music.  Deep down, you know you fucking just love the song. And your boyfriend knows it too, coz you've downloaded it on his computer when he went out to wash the car. As soon as he comes back you switch to something 'more' you.  "Fall, sometimes I fall so fast When I hit that bottom crash You're all I have  Oohhh It seems like I can finally Rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Oohhhh it's as if you know me better Than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me."  It's been an hour on repeat.  I can now sing the song out loud, minus the music perfectly. WOOT!
