I took her to lunch (on the way home from the airport) and she kept speaking Spanish to the waiter and was excited about getting lettuce from the salad bar! Also, she had trouble sleeping last night at the Holiday Inn (she was cold with the airconditioning). I guess she will be sleeping in the tent in the backyard for a few days :)   Personally, I am glad she is home....she forgot to show me how to use the DVD player while she was gone.  Dawn
