The meaning of these songs that i'm falling head over heals for. I would like to dedicated these meaning to that special someone. You know who you are cuzz I've been thinking about you constantly :). Here are some of the lyrics.   1st song *.~ I really need to be alone and I dont want to talk. I really like the way you walk. I tell you no lies, I tell you the truth. You should know that i'm hooked on you baby. Let me know what we're going through. More and more your in my world. I tell you no lies, I tell you the truth. You should know i'm so into you baby. How I feel your heart beat is true. I am so in love with you, cant you feel the reason my love? I'm not quilty baby i'm not quilty for the moonlight. Tell me tell me that its your night baby show me heaven again. Do you feel it tonight? All I wanna do is make good love to you. Are you ready to play this game? I'll tell you no lies, I tell you the truth that i'm hooked on you baby. Cant you feel the rhythm of love? I'll show you love its not the same baby. Cant you see its just you and me?  2nd song *.~ You are the one who makes me shine. Your are the one will you be mine? You're all I need, the one for me. Oh baby dont walk away from me. All day and night I think of you. I hope that in everyways you want me to. Its a fine day, ship your love my way.  Shesh, now I sound so girlish. All these dedications makes me go Errr!!!
