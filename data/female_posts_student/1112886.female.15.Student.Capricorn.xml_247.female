In fifth grade it was, Perhaps you need another email account. Try yahoo. In sixth grade it was, The school has given you an email account. You're required to use it. Now, I get an email saying, You might want another email account. Try google g-mail.  Do they realize I now must check four email accounts? Actually, I check school email only during school. And the rest, like every other day (sometimes every other month depending on how dependent I am on the computer). At the moment, it's peak babysitting season. Parents have summer parties and the kids are out of school. This is good for us babysitters. I plan on paying off all my debts (only ~$100) and earning money to keep me happy until next season. However, I don't see people's christmas presents coming from this fund. Maybe everyone will get potholders or something easy for me to make. Or I can just bake a bunch of cookies which will probably win out. Haha. Sorry, I think I just ruined it for you. Oh well, you can be surprised at how cheap I am and I'm probably very cheap.  Drivers ed continues. The only thing getting me through the agony is the thought that one day, I shan't depend on others to help me escape. I hate having to call 5 people everytime I need a ride, or showing up somewhere at 11 because my parents were either at work or had something better to do (watch soap operas).  Off topic a bit, my family is really into soap operas. My mother, my grandmother, and my grandfather all watch soaps. My brother and my dad only watch sports. I'm the odd one. I like interior design shows. Is that too strange? I like the pretty colors and the idea that I could be creative (I'd probably step on it though. I step on everything.) Interior design is so much fun. I wish I could redecorate our bathroom. At the moment the wallpaper is ugly 50s print. The tub is grey and pink (such a charming color combination. Not.). I like four items our bathroom; the clear duck in the rain trashcan, the metal wire containers, the vase with lollipops in it, and the blue locker shelf that is now serving as an extra hair dryer kind of type stuff shelf. May I add that 1) They match each other and not the bathroom and 2) I put most of them in. Unfortunatly, the locker shelf shall only be with us until September when it moves back into my locker at school. Actually, I don't use a locker, so need I a locker shelf? This point is debatable and the conversation shall be resumed closer to the start of school.  More on the point of interior decorating, I've decided to retire some posters in my room. Colin Farell, Paul Walker, Eminem, and Milo Ventimiglia shall be leaving and will hopefully be replaced by some conventional shelves. The dophins, Tom Welling (not that I need him, but he brings color as his shirt is red), All-American Rejects (same note as Tom), Elijah, Mike Skinner, the Far Side Comic about sound technicians, The Pirates poster, another Elijah, Lord of the oil, a picture for seventh grade, a lion thing from my nursery when I was a baby, the calendar, another nursery wall-hanging, the soccer picture from sixth grade, a black-and-white picture of a beach that I colored on, and the butterflies will stay. O and Legolas and Gimli will stay as well because they make a comical hat rack. Of course, right now I've also got scarves, stuffed monkeys, stilletos, and belts hanging on them too, so the term "hat" rack might be inappropriate.  I think I'll sleep now. I have a PB teen catalog that I want to skim. (My god, I'm interior design freak.)
