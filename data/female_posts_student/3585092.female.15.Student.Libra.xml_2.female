JaPaN! on the 24th of september i will be on a plane on my way to japan for 14 days! i can't believe it! while i'm there i will also be spending my first birthday away from home :) !!!!! i can say a few things in japanese, like " minasama, hajimemashite" that means " pleased to meet you"  "namae wa amelia desu" which is "my name is amelia" i can't wait! i'll be staying with a japanese family while i'm there,  i'm going with my friends stef, emily, possibly teil, corey, liz  a girl i knew from primary school called kim...not really that good friends with her but oh well... my friend emily has also started to organise a small club that will promote the trips to japan. itz run through an organisation called C.I.F.A, which acts as more of a charity program kuz the only way it gets its money is through ppls membership. this would be great kuz the more ppl who join the club, the better it is for C.I.F.A kuz they r sponsoring the club :)  then more ppl will go to japan :):):) so it's great for everyone.  eww...nearly vomitted just then....GROSS!  94 DAYS!
