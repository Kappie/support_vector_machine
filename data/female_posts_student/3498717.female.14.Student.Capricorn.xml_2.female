Me and "TJ" went to help Ms. Jordan to change her file things.  She gave us Twizzlers for helping her. Yum Yum.  So we went back to Mrs. Laster's class and Ms. Gladwell came in and Anisa asked her if some of us could go to tanagrams so Mrs. Laster picked ppl and I wasn't one of them so I just got up and left. HeHeHe. Then after that we went back to her class and Jordan Wilson was outside and he was hilarious! He would come in there and like sneak around and get her all mad it was really funny!! Then we went back to homeroom with all the ppl who didn't make the ar celebration and who was still waiting to go. I was talking to Jen Hill and Ms Myers was walking towards us and Braden got on the counter and his pants fell down! Jen Hill and Ms Myers were the only ones i think that saw! (Thank Goodness i didnt see it :P) We had to do social studies worksheets but i wasnt about to do them :P hehe.. we went to lunch .. (Me, Jen Hill, LeAnna, Braden, Randy and Brian)
