Let me know if you want free space on GOLDEN SUSHI and I will set you up a username and password (of your choice) just like Pia.  That way you won't have to deal with the GeoCities Ad Square anymore.  The only downside is you will need to download an FTP program to upload to your space.  The space is available for you if you want it.  Just let me know.
