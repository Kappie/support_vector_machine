Weather: VERY sunny (I should probably be outside)   I can't find my Mandy Moore CD! I've been trying to find all of the CDs that I want to take with me on vacation, and I can't find it! I'm not the best with actually putting CDs back in their correct cases, but I've looked everywhere. I've got my  urlLink Gavin DeGraw  and  urlLink Five For Fighting  CDs ready though. I never thought that I would like so many different kinds of music. I used to just listen to country, then I changed to christian, and I then moved on to pretty much anything. My friend Casey made me a copy of the Evanescence CD, and now it seems like whenever my other friend Bekah calls, I'm either listening to it or the one song is on the radio. Bekah HATES their song. She thinks that someone's dying or something! lol Anyway, I also like Liz Phair, The Calling, Marroon Five, Ashlee Simpson and Yellowcard. With christian music, I like pretty much anyone.   I strongly believe that everyone should have their own web site. People go out of town all of the time and unless they have a cell phone, there is no way to figure out where they are. lol I'm the one always planning the get togethers here, and I need to know if people are in town!! Plus, it's good to know what's going on in your friend's lives.   I'm really working on two things this summer - well, maybe three. It feels like I've been spending my summer at the DMV! I FINALLY got my license last Thursday, and it was my 3rd try at it. The people at the DMV here are really mean!!! And I am a good driver - just so you know. I've also been working on being more outgoing, which probably sounds geeky and really stupid, but I don't care. I'm really tired of high school because of the judgement and all that crap. Plus, I hate it when people assume that they know you or that they 'get you' and they really don't. Also, half of the people who signed my yearbook this year put something along the lines of, "hey, you're quiet but sweet, have a great summer!" I'm tired of being the quiet girl! lol I'm also trying to become a better reader. I love to write, and I have all of my life - check out my books  urlLink BLEND  and  urlLink Out of the Ordinary  - but I've never liked to read too much. I remember the first books that I ever got hooked on were the Nancy Drew series. hahaha For me, if I'm not interested in a book, I probably won't get past the first chapter. hehehe I should be a publisher or something - I'd be strict! Anyone know of any good books that I should read? I'm going to finish this one by  urlLink Meg Cabot  that I started reading a while ago called, "Haunted." It's the fifth book in her, "The Mediator Series." (which by the way is awesome, you should totally check it out!) After I finish that I'll probably read, "How To Deal" by  urlLink Sarah Dessen . The book I have is two stories in one so it's forever thick, and yes that is the book that was made into the movie How to Deal. I've also been reading a lot of  urlLink Nicholas Sparks's  books lately ( winks at Kevin ) and all of his books so far are great! He's one of my idols! I've even been to his site and looked up his advice on getting published.   Taking about getting published brings me to  Ashden . It's my prospective 3rd novel. I really want it to make it somewhere, and I think that it could if I try my best on it because it's really unique. I'm not going to tell you any more about it (hehehe all you get to know is the title) I'm sorry, but it's top secret! I've been planning it out for about a year now, and I've just recently started to write my thoughts down on paper. I need to start working things into chapters now, but I'm kinda putting it off, and believe me, if you saw my desk you would too. I'm the type of person who will come up with a great idea at a totally random moment, and so I always just jot things down here and there on some computer or notebook paper. Of course, when I actually have to attempt to read my handwriting later - that's a challenge! lol j/k   I get these catalogs from a store called  urlLink Alloy , and I really don't know why they keep sending them to me because I never buy anything, but I thought that this  urlLink sweatshirt  was pretty cool, and it kind of made me laugh because my friends and I are always joking around about being po and not poor. I think it would be cool to find a shirt that says, "I'm not poor..." on the front and, "I'm po!" on the back. lol For those of you who don't know ... when you're po, you're poorer than poor! I think I have like ten bucks right now, but that'll be gone soon because I'm going to see King Authur with a friend next Friday.  Oh yeah -  everyone  must send one of  urlLink these  to their friends! They are so funny!!! Go check it out!  Well, that's enough for now. I'll type later.
