So here is my message from the stars- my new start, my new blog for all those who wish to read it. You can still check out the group blogs  urlLink Room 905  and the ever wonderful  urlLink DOY .   To start off with, a list of happy things which have recently occurred:   1. Visits from my Dad's side of the family including Janice, Steve, and Lynn.  2. Plenty of new movie experiences including  School of Rock ,  Ella Enchanted , and  50 First Dates . I love new movies. Or really any movies.   3. A new favorite movie to watch! It's called  In America  and you should all go watch it.  Now.    4. CA Pizza Kitchen Pizzas. Enough said.   5. I have discovered a new Broadway show:  Wicked . It's so good. Stephen Schwarz is a god.  Oh and an announcement:  MORGAN AND RACHEL BOTH HOOKED UP WITH SOMEONE!  Yes, they finally have "their men" as Morgan calls it, and are perfectly happy. YAY! All you need is love, you know. As for Katie Camille and Eric, apparently they both have interesting prospects. Muhaha.   As for me? Well, I was at Macaroni Grill the other day with my mother where our waiter was a complete dream. He was tall, good looking, good sense of humor. Lovely. And he had a tie with penguins on it. His name, which he so eloquently wrote on the tablecloth, was  Brad . Of course, my mother and I had a lovely time and I secretly plotted to come back and check Brad out.  Trust me, he's worth it .   Well, after going to the Bartlett 10 to see Ella Enchanted with my aunt Janice last night, I headed into TCBY to get some ice cream. Bad for me, yes, but it was very good. And, it is a good thing that I splurged because all of a sudden, who should come through the door but  BRAD!  * dies from excitement * And he recognized me! Morgan says I failed in this part cause I didn't get his phone number. Rawr. So we talked for a minute or two and he introduced himself to my aunt and then got some ice cream. Lovely. The shocking part of this is, that I was wearing the exact same thing I wore to Macaroni Grill.   SHIT!    Long story short my friends, we have a mission. I will pay any willing person to go with me to Macaroni Grill and meet Brad the waiter guy. I need courage. I need charm.  I need other clothes ! hahaha!    I miss you all and I hope that things will pick up to where I can see everyone soon. I need to get back with my friends again.
