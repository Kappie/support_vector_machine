And then after I'd sat in the little recovery room for awhile and they told me I could leave they tried to help me stand up and walk.  But it felt like walking drunk, so I didn't have much of a problem, and they told me I was pretty good.  I almost said "I'm used to walking drunk, so this is pretty easy" but I caught myself.  I don't know what would have happened if I did... not much probably.  Anyway, then I came home and slept a lot, then Ken came over, we played Monopoly (I lost), then we went to bed.  So yeah.  Yesterday was fun.  I was feeling bored around 12ish and thinking that I hadn't seen Heathy in awhile, so I texted her to see if she wanted to do something.  So we went to Subway to see Scary, then we went over to Beth's to see her and Sam.  Then Sam left, and Heathy went to work, so Beth and I walked down to the Red Rooster.  We got there at like, 4:30, so Pookie wasn't there yet, but we got ice cream and talked to Becca.  Then Lainie got there, and we talked to her for awhile.  Got chinese.  Then Beth and I left around 7 something and walked to Andy's house, but he wasn't there, so we went to Robert's.  His car wasn't there, so we called him and he said he and Andy were on their way back.  So then Beth and I helped Robert and Andy clean up from the party monday night (I helped clean up after a party I wasn't even at... oh well).   Then Jenny came over and we played cards and ate watermelon.  Then we met AJ at Taco Bell.  Came back to Robert's for awhile.  Watched some movies.  Jason Perdelwitz came over... We all played Monopoly, then Jason and Jenny both left.  Then me, Beth, Robert, Andy, and AJ got the bottles out of the cornfield, then put them in Robert's trunk and burned the boxes.  Robert put a lot of gasoline on the fire... Then  AJ cleaned out his car and we burned a rug and shit.  That was cool.  Went inside and watched another movie, then Beth and I tried to sneak back into her house and the door was locked... So we went back to Robert's and spent the night there, and when we got back there was a note for Beth saying she was grounded for not coming home... So that really sucks, b/c she'll probably be grounded until school starts.  She can still prob. sneak out for Robert's parties, but I don't know what she's going to do for Jake and Millertime's party...  Anyway... don't know what I'm doing today. Ken works until 12, then he's going to Tabitha's funeral, then he's going to come over.  We might go over to Jason and Sami's.  And I need to drop off Pookie's sunglasses at her house sometime before she leaves.  I need to call Robert too, to see if Ken can come to the party.  He could get Jason and Sami to come too, if we want it to be a bigger party.  God, I'm so excited that I get to get drunk again tomorrow night... I haven't gotten drunk in two weeks...  I'm just not going to take my painkillers tomorrow.  Maybe one when I wake up, but I won't take anything after noon.  Otherwise I'll get sick.  And I can deal with the pain... once I get drunk it won't matter anyway...  That's it for now I guess.  Call me if you can Bethy.
