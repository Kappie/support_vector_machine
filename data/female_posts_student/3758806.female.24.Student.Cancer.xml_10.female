I just had my father over and we spent about an hour and a half trying to set up this satellite thing, and he kept saying "co-axial this" and "co-axial that" and although I'm sure he thought he was helping, the word co-axial is just not a part of my vocabulary and was stressing me out more than anything. It was nice for a change, though, to have my Dad around again helping me out with household nonsense- now that I live alone, whenever the toilet overflows ( which, I swear, it rarely does !) or when my electronics go wonky, I wish I had my father around .... No wonder I got so serious with an engineer after moving out. But... why did I break up with him again.  Oh, right ...  I really shouldn't be fiddling with the satellite anyway (or for that matter, this laptop I'm typing away at) considering where I am...  I'm currently in a lovely little cottage (complements of my parents) on the lake... my nearest neighbor is the forest (oh, and yes, the bears... but I'm trying not to think about them). Before today, I haven't had the opportunity to get out of the scorching hot city since Thanksgiving (read: Canadian Thanksgiving... so October, not November)... I can actually hear crickets chirping and choirs of frogs croaking, and when I stand on the dock outside my screen door (can you believe it, I actually have a screen door!) I can see tons and tons of stars. I was starting to forget what they look like. This is certainly going to get those creative juices going... Not that I've been, in any way, lacking ideas (except for " how the frick do I hook up this satellite? ")...  Cet fin de semaine, je relaxe... Je suis stressee a cause de mes cours de l'ete. Des le 30 juin, j'ai fini... Et j'ai reussis!  I'm thrilled my parents let me have this cottage for the weekend. And although I'm a grown woman now living alone in Montreal, it is rather comforting to know that, at the moment, my parents are just around the bend of the road. Or, just over the hill behind this place (would never walk across at night though... v. terrifying thought,  indeed ).  One thing I had my heart set on this weekend: watching "Puppets Who Kill". It's a  guilty pleasure , a dark and twisted show on the Comedy Network, presumably Canadian (too twisted to be American, and certainly not British)... Perhaps I'll go watch it with Mum and Dad tomorrow night.  I just realized my father stocked this fridge with booze.... He must be confusing me with someone else.
