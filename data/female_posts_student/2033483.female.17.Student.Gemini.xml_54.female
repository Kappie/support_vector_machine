But afterwards we went to Taco Bell because I had a craving.  However, it wasn't very good.  Then for the rest of the afternoon, I just did homework, bummed around the house and took a nap.  I didn't have any weird dreams during my nap.  Lately, I've been having the weirdest dreams and chances are you've been in one of them because it seems like everyone is.  But after I woke up I ate something (which I will rant about later) and watched the Osbournes.  I had a thought when I was drinking my water.  When I was younger I was in swimming lessons and I'm sure you were too.  Do you remember one of the first things they teach you is to blow bubbles in the water?  Now, why on Earth do they teach you to blow bubbles in the water?  I don't ever recall needing to use that.      Later has come.  This food thing.  When ever I'm at home, I eat all the time.  I eat when I'm hungry and when I'm not hungry, just because it's there and I can.  This is how people become fat.  I really need to watch which types of food I eat and make sure they are at least healthy.      This blog typing is distracting me from studying for vocabulary.  Not that I would actually be studying otherwise but note, this is my excuse.      I don't want to go to school tomorrow...I can't think of anyone that does...Their is snow on the ground and it's assnumbingly cold outside...There you have four good reasons why school should be called off!  God Bless, ~Kayla
