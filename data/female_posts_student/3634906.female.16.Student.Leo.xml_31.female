So you buried all your lover's clothes and burned the letters lover wrote, but it doesn't make it any better. Does it make it any better? And the plaster dented from you fist in the hall where you had your first kiss reminds you that the memories will fade. So this is strange, our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance where nobody leads at all, where nobody leads at all. And the picture frames are facing down and the ringing from this empty sound is deafening and keeping you from sleep. And breathing is a foreign task and thinking's just too much to ask and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights. This is incredible. Starving, insatiable, yes, this is love for the first time. Well, you'd like to think that you were invincible. Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time. Well this is the last time.  The Good Fight Consider the odds, consider the obvious. The martyr is meaningless, the campaign has died. In the planning stages and the fallen faces are the singular proof that it was ever alive. This purchased rebelliion has been outbidded, denounced, and rescinded and left to die championless. I begged you not to go. I begged you, I pleaded. Claimed you as my only hope and watched the floor as you retreated. Hope has sprung a perfect dive a perfect day, a perfect lie, a slowly crafted monologue conceding your defeat. This purchased rebellion has been outbidded, denounced, and rescinded and left to die championless. I begged you not to go. I begged you, I pleaded. Claimed you as my only hope and watched the floor as you retreated. Does it comfort you to know you fought the good fight? Basking in your victory, hollow and alone to boast your bitter braggin rights to anyone who'll listen. While you're left with nothing tanglible to gain.  This Bitter Pill Walking away, it's not that same as running. is it to you now that you've run this in the ground. And you say take this. This medicine is just what you deserve. Swallow, choke and die. And this bitter bill is leaving you with such an angry mouth. One that's void of all discretion such an awful tearing sound. With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare glaring over you and over you this feeling of despair is never wearing out. it's wearing off and its leaving you with such a heavy heart and a head to match. The bottle is waiting the cap is twisted begging to be used and so are you. And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth. one that's void of all discretion such an awful tearing sound. With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare glaring over you and over you this feeling of despair is never wearing out.
