I really don't want to do shit but enjoy my summer  I start thinking crazy ass shit like, "why should I have to work?" why the hell not? i know i have to make money but fuck it.     So, I looked on bonnarro's website today  I became SOOO excited about their line up....i can't wait to go! heres a side note, my back hurts  I want to scream! but at least i woke up this morning. how quickly we forget :(
