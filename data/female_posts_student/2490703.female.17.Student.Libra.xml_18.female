It was the last pair left on the shelf...Actually they were the display shoes. Anyway, I'm talking to this really cute guy online. He goes lives in East Lansing. He's so nice. I'll have to send a picture. Anyway, I have to jet, I have soccer stuff to take care of for Amanda. I will talk to you soon!  Peace and Love, Melissa
