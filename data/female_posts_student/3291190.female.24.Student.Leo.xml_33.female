It has confused me to a great extent. Basically, I am fighting with myself. Do I handle things the old way? Where I push people away  become angry, or do I look at the situation despite the fact that it causes me pain and work through it. I guess everyday we have a choice of acting in accordance with who we want to be.  It is so easy to be who you were.  But I guess as the years pass and hopefully I mature, I can come a couple steps closer to acting in a way that is consistent with who I have hoped to become.  I don't want to be resentful, angry  judgmental, so why does that seem to be our human nature? Our default? Automatically pushing things, people,  situations away out of our gaze when they become painful.  Maybe to protect ourselves. I want to transcend these feelings, so they don't prevent me from enjoying the experiences that we are blessed with everyday.  It is so easy to become consumed with your own thoughts and feelings. Another struggle has been essentially living with my boyfriend.  I take him to court,  work almost everyday.  We share expenses (although I feel as though I pay for more than my fair share).  These are the trivial petty things that fill my days lately. We struggle with when to go to bed, whether he smokes in the house, if is friends are coming over, if we should go out  party. When really it is our life style differences  life goals that are pulling us in two different directions.  I become resentful when I feel like I am doing too much for him. I begin to think, where is my fucking ring?!? Even though I don't want one from him. Then I begin to feel like his mother! Which leads to thoughts of breaking up with him. (like when I had to take him to work at 5 am  he never said thank you, or offered gas money for driving him around for 2 weeks).  Then I think, I am being selfish, people do this for their children  family everyday. I asked him last night if he would do the same thing for me. He said yes. Then I began to wonder, what the fuck am I doing? Then it hit me......This is yet another example of me avoiding conflict, avoiding potential painful situations.  If I am upset, I need to speak up, saying what I mean  asking for what I need. Instead of becoming upset that he hasn't offered gas money, I should ask for it.  Now I am not saying that I am going to let or accept people running over me. I should accept the fact that people are going to disappoint me from time to time and that I can't complain about not receiving things I never asked for in the first place.  Life  situations are never perfect.    They are never what we had hoped for or what we had in mind.  Therefore, we have to work with what we have, try to be who we want to be and be upfront  honest about the things we want.   There are many wonderful things that Evan brings to my life, much like many of my friends.  Sometimes it is difficult to see clearly when close up is the only perspective you have to view the situation.  I guess I am just trying to deal with life  enjoy it at the same time.  Life is too short to be angry or constantly proving that you are right.  Besides, who cares, none of it matters in the end. Trying to live in the moment and still logically manage your life are difficult.  Its easy to read about it, but difficult to practice.  Evan brings the wonderful gift of living in the moment to my life.  Some may call it hedonistic, I don't really care. It is helpful in letting go of the vices that consume me  half of America.  It helps to distract me from my set way of life, breaks my routine, makes me feel uncomfortable and ultimately helps me to live a little more spontaneously.  Its like a roller coaster, a part of you is wondering why the fuck you even got on this ride, the other half is screaming with terror  sheer joy that the adventure brings.  Looking back at the ride, you feel speechless, and a smile covers your face.  I am tired of routine, I enjoy looking at things around me with a fresh perspective, as though for the first time.  So I am annoyed with the hassles that these relationships bring to my life, but forever thankful for the wonderful experiences they have given me. Ultimately, I am enjoying the ride, closing my eyes and throwing the rest to the side.
