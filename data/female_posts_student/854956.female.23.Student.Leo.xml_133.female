I don't know why... maybe the fact that 3 of my best friends are all obviously in on some joke that I'm out of (see comments link two posts below)... but I feel really down.  I know that it's in their right to have huge inside jokes without me because I don't talk to them as much as I could (or should for that matter).  But I've been so friggin' busy and have just been a huge bundle of nerves for the past week (because of stuff going on with my Grandma) that I don't really feel it's entirely my fault.  What's been going on with me?  Well, number one (first and foremost) my Grandma is much more sick than we realized, and the doctors STILL don't know what the Hell is wrong with her.  I mean, they know that she's old, and that she's having atrial fibrillation (A-fib), but it's not her heart.  Yes, you wouldn't be the only one to think that sounds really contradictory.  In addittion to all this... their previous thought that she had a minor stroke got thrown out and they said she had a minor heart attack.  However, the doctor has now said he thinks she probably suffered a minor stroke AND minor heart attack.  His remedy initially was medicine to control her A-fib.  Then the other night when I went to go visit her he came in the room while she was having some tests run, and told us something we didn't really want to hear.  He said he wants to put her on Coumadin.  This is a drug used to thin the blood.  What's the big deal?  Well, for one thing, she lives alone an hour away from any of her children.  So, if she ever falls, it literally could be life threatening because her blood would be thinned and she could bleed to death very quickly.  So, we've all been a whole jumble of nerves.  In addition to all that mess that's going on, I've been doing the whole school/work thing.  I've been doing okay in my classes and I'm doing great at work... but, I'm REALLY wearing myself thin.  I go straight from school to work (after a bite to eat, of course) and then I leave work and come home to eat, do homework, take a shower and fall into bed.  Very rarely do I have ANY extra time to just sit around... and when I do I fall asleep.  For example, last night I came home... to an empty house.  I got something to eat... I came to my room and turned on the tv with every intention of watching some tube.  However, at about 8:30, I fell asleep... and I didn't wake up again til around 12:30, at which point I mustered up enough energy to change my away message, brush my teeth, and fall back into bed.  The only upside to anything right now is that I don't have to worry about going to music lab on Fridays anymore... however, now I need to use some of that time to go to an elementary school and observe special ed kids for my exceptionalities class field experience.  ARGH!  It's never-ending this semester... and next semester is going to be even WORSE!  Mainly because I'll probably do band... although, I'm thinking of waiting until next school year altogether.  I don't know if I can do this...  and now I'm going to go look at cars (probably next weekend) so I'll have car payments to make... and I won't be able to take summer school most likely because I'll have to work and there's a good chance I can do the summer camp with A.S.K.  And it hit me last night on my drive home from work.  This is what the rest of my life is going to be like.  I'll ALWAYS be busy.  I'll never have a moment of rest... ever.  Just when I think I'll have a break, I'll remember something like, "Oh... I have to make the lesson plan about the '3' multiplication tables for Thursday," and there I'll go again.  (sigh)  And this doesn't even include the other confusions that jumble my mind every day, all day, during the week.  So... question... if we're not doing X-men for Halloween... what ARE we doing...?  Cause, I only have next weekend and the following weekend to put a costume together now.  I'm going to take a nap now, and then I'm going to do music theory homework, study for 2 music theory tests, study for an exceptionalities test, make something we need for work, do all of my sign language work, and I'll probably have a couple meals during the rest of the weekend if there's time.
