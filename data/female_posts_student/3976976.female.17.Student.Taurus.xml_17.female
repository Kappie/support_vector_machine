That is a shitty way of expressing how grateful you are that they actually stand by you no matter what! I swear if I put a you (you know who you are) in the same situation you wouldleave or you would bitch back! If you are gonna treat someone like shit then don't get mad if they bitch.. they have the right to do so and you should wonder why they put up with all the shit... did it ever come to you that they maybe really want to be your friend and you should just cool it. If you are going to tell me to do something ask me nicely and I'll either respond nicely no or I might do it. The world does not revolve around you! Sometimes people can be such assholes, and even bigger shitheads when they blame you or something that happened by the way they are acting, quit fucking around... the problem is YOU! I can't take it for long.. either you treat me like I should be treated.. or FUCK off because someone else appreciates my Fuckin presence and friendship!
