Or horribly disfigure them. torture them, anyway. Their parenting skills are horrible.  I was at jessies house, and i was just having fun, and then my mom calls me and is all "your dads coming to get you right now" and so then he shows up, lets himself in jessies house, and walks around to see who alls there. then i get in the car and he starts SCREAMING at me because... i dont know. He's an ass. And he was all "THERE WERE NO PARENTS AT HOME, you LIED to us... blah blah blah scream scream" and then he got all mad cause there werent any parents home to "supervise me and jessie and melissa". Like i am 12.   INSANITY.  Being in my house makes me feel like i'm going crazy. They control things just for the sake of controling them, not even for safety or anything (like when they tried to give me a curfew one night when i was spending the night at jessies??? lol) and they do stupid things to piss me off (like unplugging my computer or just HOVERING over me when im trying to do something...dylan knows this) so ill be angry so they can blame everything bad that ever happens on me. and when im really sad, they dont care, they just point all the bad things out and try to lay guilt trips on me.   GAH! Anyone want to make $50 for doing a hit job?    abby
