So I've found that I need a hobbie, the only thing I really do is hang out with my friends, and I can no longer stand to be at home unless it is just for the night. I most likely have a job at a bar...the call will come in tomorrow if I get it. We can't afford shampoo right now if you want to know why I need one. I've been feeling what it's like to be happy again instead of depressed 24/7. It felt so good I have to do something to make myself happy. I, also, have to do something to make every day worth living. I'm okay with doing nothing, as long as I'm not doing 'nothing' at home or I'm doing 'nothing' with someone.  Phrase Of The Day: Hey Look! I can be a fishyyyy! Song Of The Day: Timberwolves In New Jersey -Taking Back Sunday Event Of The Day: Shane teaching me how to play pool at the bar I'm about to work at...
