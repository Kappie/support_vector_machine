At work i've been playing basketball with Al and some of the kids and then playing Spit and that's about it. I cant wait for x-mas in July haha. But next week Christina wont be there =( but matt will. Hopefully someone will come visit me.       Today i went to the mall for afavor for my brother steven's friend Alex. So i brought Simko along and we had quite an adventure. After we ate we decided to go out onto the Bridge..so we walked all the way down and then .. climbed the fence cause i wanted to go into the parking lot. But then we found that there was another, bigger fence that we couldnt climb. So we climbed the one fence again and then walked the bridge back. My dad was at the doors to get back into the mall with the biggest smirk on his face. We went to open the door and we couldnt! haha then we asked him to open it and he couldnt either. So my mom had to get a security guard to open the door for us haha .. that was great tho lmao      Thenn after that event we went to the Avoca picnic. The picnic it self was kinda sucky but we went to eat somewhere else w. Jess and Sarah so that was a lot of fun. Then me and Simko walked around some more and almost got into a fight. These people drove by us and were yelling stuff out the window so as they drove away we flipped them off. A few minutes later three white guys that were acting like tough shit came outta their car and got up in our faceand were all likee 'yo did u flip us off??" and simko was just like .. no, you were sayin stuff so we waved. Then the one guy was like yeahh show us your fingers and he did a nice spirit finger move. They got pissy and werejust kind ofdecided to screw the whole thing and then they walked off andwe started laughing. Sothe other one was like 'are u laughing? ill take you with my one arm'. (because he had the one in a sling haha) But whatever that was the excitement of out lives and it was pretty funny if you ask me.       Hopefully the rest of my weekend will be just as good but maybe with other people who i would like to hang out with more =\ I dont think i'm gonna get into that right now . maybe another time.. xoxo Casey
