For some reason I just always put an extra "A" in there.  He promptly made fun of my pronounciation to pay me back for making fun of his goofy-looking hair.  I had to get him back so naturally I made a jibe about his spelling skills (or lack of, that is).  "At least I can spell it!"  He goes, "I can too spell it!  A-L-P-H-A-P-H-A!"  I rest my case.
