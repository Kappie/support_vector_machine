I'm getting ready for bed at 10:30pm on a Friday evening because I want to get up at 6:30 in the morning to run. I want to get in a good long run before having to be at the zoo tomorrow (more orang watching..., oh and children, it's O-R-A-N-G-U-T-A-N, there is no freakin' "G" at the end). Yes, I could probably do this without waking up before the sun, but I want to stay on my schedule. Plus, less people are out that early in the morning, which means I don't have to be scared of creepy people. Most of the crackheads are still sleeping. Most of the ones I know, anyway.   EWWW speaking of crackheads. I was stretching out after my run the other morning, and this guy, some old guy whom I do not know, drove up (ie. pulled into my schools parking lot, where I was stretching by my car, and not in a sexy stick my butt out way or anything) and tells me to "start walkin', it's allready 79 degrees by the clock". To which I was like... No, Im sorry, did I somehow give the impression I needed company?  Sheeesh! The one day my running buddy doesn't show and I get this crap. To makethings worse, I keep thinking about how I have no hot young boys slobbering after me, but I do have a plethora of old creepy ones. Seriously. Any of you girls out there need a stalker? I could just lend you one of mine. Ok, I need to throw in a little activism, since that's my thing for another year or so till I've finished my Americorp time,   urlLink  this   makes me angry.    I should here lead into my story about how I helped at the nature center, a couple of weeks back. We had a new male bald eagle in, because some retard was shooting them along the Kansas River. Whomever shot him had killed his mate, and he was being torn up by scavengers when we found him. It amazes me, the stupidity that abounds in this nation. We aren't even sure we will be able to release him, because he may not be able to use the talon near where he was injured. Some days I really hate people in a big way. I think taking an animal off of the endangered species act just because it has recovered slightly only increases its risks, especially to things like poaching. Ok. Enough of my preaching for one night?
