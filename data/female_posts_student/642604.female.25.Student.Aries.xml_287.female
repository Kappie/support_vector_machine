So after running some errands today and going back to work I stop off at the drivethru and clearly state that I want a Chicken Caesar salad.  They repeat it back, it comes up on the little screen thingy... so I finally get back over to the office in Herndon and deal with a few matters before I can get to my salad.  The first thing I notice is it's a garden salad... which is fine I just had to get rid of the onions and other things I didn't want.  Then I open up the little pouch of chicken to put it on the salad and it's shrimp.  I have nothing against shrimp at all but A) I didn't want it and B) no offense but I don't want shrimp from Burger King. It lived up to my first instincts about it and was absolutely gross.  So now I've eaten about 1/3 of the salad and I've tossed it, now I guess I'll just eat my string cheese and drink my diet coke.  If Burger King is always saying you can get everything your way why is it that I constantly get things their way and nothing like the way I ordered them?  Explain please?  Do we all remember the two veggie burger incidents in the past?
