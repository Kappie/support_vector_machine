Jason's out of town which means I'm doing his job as well as mine, I'm in intake hell and have interviewed a potential total of 5 interns for fall semester.  Ack.  Thankfully, 2 of them are oldies, so they won't need to be trained and Christie doesn't need onsite supervision, so hopefully it won't be that bad.  I wish I could keep the 4 I have right now around forever, because they are WONDERFUL.  But alas, they're off to get jobs where they actually get paid.  :(  I've decided that if and when my raise actually goes through I'm going to overhaul my site on my own domain and actually break down and learn html.  We'll see if that ever happens.  I was also supposed to write a new play this summer, but I haven't even put pen to paper yet.  I'll add that to the list of things I intend to do on the roadtrip that won't actually get done because I'll be passed out in the back of Babe trying not to throw up.     My goal for today is to decide what  urlLink broadway show  I want to see whilst in New York.  Any suggestions?
