Maybe i should do my homework.. hm no) and just from picking colors in a certain order it tells you all this stuff about you... and it's strangely close. This is what they told me:  *         *         *         *         *  Your Existing Situation Works well in cooperation with others but is disinclined to take the leading role. Needs a personal life of mutual understanding and freedom from discord.  Your Stress Sources The existing situation is disagreeable. Has an unsatisfied need to ally herself with others whose standards are as high as her own, and to stand out from the rank and file. Her control of her sensual instincts restricts her ability to give herself, but the resulting isolation leads to the urge to surrender and allow herself to merge with another. This disturbs her. as such instincts are regarded as weaknesses to be overcome; she feels that only by continued self-restraint can she hope to maintain her attitude of individual superiority. Wants to be loved or admired for herself alone; needs attention, recognition, and the esteem of others.  Your Restrained Characteristics Circumstances are forcing her to compromise, to restrain her demands and hopes, and to forgo for the time being some of the things she wants.  Your Desired Objective Wants interesting and exciting things to happen. Able to make herself well-liked by her obvious interest and by the very openness of her charm. Over-imaginative and given to fantasy or day-dreaming.  Your Actual Problem Greatly impressed by the unique, by originality, and by individuals of outstanding characteristics. Tries to emulate the characteristics she admires and to display originality in her own personality.  Your Actual Problem #2 Has a fear that she might be prevented from achieving the things she wants. This leads her to employ great personal charm in her dealings with others, hoping that this will make it easier for her to reach her objectives.   ____________________________  I don't know how well I know myself but to me that's pretty right. Especially the part about being over-imaginative, and day-dreamy. Some call it spaciness.. but day-dreamy.. yeah that's a much better word.
