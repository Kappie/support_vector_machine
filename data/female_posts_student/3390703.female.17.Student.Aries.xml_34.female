Marcea showed up, and it made me so happy because I haven't hung out with her in the longest time!  After awhile of sitting, and getting fat me and Marcea decided to go in the pool ... and then Lori and Mark joined us!  It was a lot of fun! I peverted the little kids by showing them how to get clevage!   1-2-3-Make it grow!   Then my sister's drama teacher yelled at me and told me that the little boys were not used to seeing boobs, and blah blah blah!  While this is all going on I can hear Mark chanting in the background, "Slut Slut Slut!"  Wow, that sure did make me feel special!   Then we went back to my house and waited for Frank and Bob to come over!  Ummm, they didn't stay for very long!  Bob spent most of the time typing a report on sports for Mark!  What a nice guy!  ... I shaved Franks neck, and he got razor burn a little bit, and I felt bad!  Oh well! The guys refused to take Lori home because they had buisness to take care of!  ... But they ended up not being able to do or get what they wanted because a group of black men started to walk towards their car, and I guess they got scared or something?    Only 2 more days of school!  I am so happy!  I really need a break!  I'm so sick of studying, and dealing with all the people!  The people that are worth seeing I will see over the summer, and I can't wait!  I miss Ashleigh, a lot!  And I want to see her!  Thursday is our 1 year anniversary (We've been best friends for that long!)  So I think we are going to have a sleepover or something, YAY!
