Is it someone so freakin' perfect in every way that makes you want to be just like them? Or is it someone who you like spending time with; someone who teaches you important life lessons; someone who touches your soul profoundly...?  Sad to say, I didn't grow up having this role model character! You ask kids who they wanna be like when they grow up. Mostly you'll hear "my mommy" or "my daddy". I love my parents but I can't say that I admire them. Sad. I know. I grew up learning morals and lessons my own way-through my own trial and error. Not that I am complaining-just that I'm kinda missing out on that "my mom always told me...", "my dad taught me..." I've never had any stories told to me that were passed down from generation to generation. No recipes, no heirlooms... I get everything I need. But is that love? I'm  positive  that my parents love me... but maybe in a "wrong" way...or maybe it's just me... I want them to ask me how school is going, check my grades, ask about friends, life... anything !!!Butt into my life!!!  I don't recall ever having a profound conversation with them!  Oddly enough, I'm proud of who I am; of who I've become and who I am growing to be. I'm a producy of my own equation. I've learned to take all the negativaty and reciprocate it into positive factors. I have my own visions. My own opinions, ethics, morals, standards, values...whatever you wanna call them. I've learned to develop tough skin and not take any shit from anyone. I don't give it damn what anyone thinks of me or of who I am. I believe that I am a great being. And I'm not meaning to toot my own horn here, but I have never done harm to anyone...(not intentionally)...at least I've never been confronted of it. I have no desire to do evil, or get pleasure to watch someone suffer. I love life. I love people. I love the little simple things. I just wish everyone did. That everyone would stop this hate and criticism, stop putting others down. To just take notice of others' feelings and consider that what they do is having an affect on others... ahh.... I guess I'll only daydream about this metaphoric utopia...la la la....
