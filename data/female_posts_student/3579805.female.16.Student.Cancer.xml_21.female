We always laugh a lot and today was no exception. Shes going through some really tough stff, i hope i can help her, im sure as hell gonna try. Shane is seriously sending mixed messags. Its like one minute he wants to be around me and the next hes annoyed with me.He needs to decide. Sam says she thinks he just wants ass and i dont have a had time believing that, but she always says she thins hes confused. AHHHHHH heres a sam quote...of her talking about how he wants ass and not a relationship..."which is understandable but he doesn't want that, and there's not much you can do untill he realizes that he's missing out and then is like wow, that caro chick is hot, and I want to be with her " I hope that happens and i still wanna be with him if it does. His friend Cam is a cutie too. But still i want shane, he has no idea how much either. ugh gonna go talk to meeh sarah....
