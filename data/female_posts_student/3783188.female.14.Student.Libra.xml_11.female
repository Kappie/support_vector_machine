But then her momma called and said that she could not find our phone number and that Alixas is not feeling good. Thats why she didn't come! But she said that she would give me the money anywayz! $45 a week! YES!!! LOL! I'm sooooooo happy! She's coming tomorrow though! So, you     s must be pretty busy cuz you arn't on very much! I miss talking to you! Please get on before I have to get off!  Luv ya all!          Your Sis In Christ,     Hannah Joy
