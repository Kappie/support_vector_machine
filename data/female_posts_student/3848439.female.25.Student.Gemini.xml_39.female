So a Lutheran chaplain, who's honestly not much of a Marist, gets to create a service and preach a sermon in prep for Sunday chapel services at a hospital that serves mostly Roman Catholics.  On a feast day celebrating a person who's basic identity is seen in vastly different lights by Lutherans and Roman Catholics.  Great.  I resisted adding into the sermon, "And when Mary died and went to heaven, I'm sure her other sons and daughters mourned her passing."  Perpetual virginity my rump.  I just had a dry run with the other chaplains, and it went pretty well.  But, question: what does the (Blessed Virgin?) Mary, Mother of Our Lord mean to you?  Feel free to  urlLink email me  with any ideas or leave a comment on this post.  Even if they come after I do the service, I'd be glad to hear from folks.
