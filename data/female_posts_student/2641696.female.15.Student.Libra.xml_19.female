He was one of the most modern, most intelligent and just damn sexiest famous guy from history. Plus, his name is simply awesome. Voltaire. Woo go sci-fi cheesiness!   And, I hope you all had a happy Valentine's. While a prince didn't carry me off into the horizon, I'm not too upset with that, because I'm still wondering how the sun doesn't burn you once you get there.    And , I got this quote at  urlLink Motivational Quotes of the Day . Great site :)   Finally, to get to my original point... how true is this quotation?? I mean come on, this is basically what boredom is. Once everything's been done and said and thought - what left is there to do or say or think? People who constantly explain things when words really can't describe them and the things should just be left alone, are, in essence,  dull ... Not to mention that they bug me.   So maybe this would explain why people fall asleep while scientists are talking; they just explain too much. Leave me life's mystery! I want to continue replying 'magic' to questions and believe it! Not only are people who push back the curtains to show reality boring, they're dream-breakers. And that's just wrong. Dream-breaking should be made illegal. It's as evil as murder, at least; maybe it's worse. I would rather be dead than dreamless.   This has wandered a bit further from where I meant it to go, but I'm fine with that.   Scientists, I think, are all wrong. Or at least, they're going about their business all wrong. Maybe there aren't angels, and maybe there is no heaven in the clouds, but you know what? There is just as much wonder in that! Textbooks don't describe the beauty of it. I think they are stealing our childhood. I think that if society didn't insist on us all facing reality, we'd stay children for the rest of our lives. We'd be able to live in our own Neverland. Think happy thoughts...   Maybe that's what it is - we only age because we lose our innocence. Maybe that's the key to eternal youth - keeping our innocence.   You know, in a past entry I said I was a realist, that I want to face reality, that I  do  face reality. This entry might make me a hypocrite to some, but I still think I'm looking reality right in the eye. My reality, at least. In my reality, fairies still pull my hair.
