Here's a song that we like by... you guessed it! Sarah McLachlan! We loff/lurv her, yush we do. ^_^ She's really good at capturing the mood in her songs. Here you go! "Full of Grace," go download it, OR ELSE!  The winter here's cold, and bitter// it's chilled us to the bone// we haven't seen the sun for weeks// too long too far from home// I feel just like I'm sinking// and I claw for solid ground// I'm pulled down by the undertow// I never thought I could feel so low// oh darkness I feel like letting go//  If all of the strength and all of the courage// come and lift me from this place// I know I could love you much better than this// full of grace// full of grace// my love//  So it's better this way, I said// having seen this place before // where everything we say and do// hurts us all the more// its just that we stayed, too long in the same old sickly skin// I'm pulled down by the undertow// I never thought I could feel so low// oh darkness I feel like letting go//  If all of the strength and all of the courage// come and lift me from this place// I know I could love you much better than this// full of grace// full of grace// my love//  Well... there it is! Read the lyrics, download and listen to the song.. then reflect on this. It's good for your creative thinking. Maybe after deeply thinking and reflecting, you'll even get it. Nah. It's not that easy to understand. Your loss. Tata! ^_^  Love and Peace Out! ~SDchan Hoshi... neh?
