There were like 100 Navs staff and student workers there which was crazy.  I was there to look after the 21 kiddies (why do all Christian families have tons of kids?) We had a 2month, a 9 month, a 12 month, a 18 month, a 21/2, a 31/2 and a 41/2 kid in my room! Was mad, tiring but good fun.  Little Gracie who was 2 months was SO sweet.  I got to hold her and change her nappy -in fact I got to change all the babies’ nappies!  I used to have to do that when I was an auxiliary nurse and then a student nurse on children’s wards, and when you’ve done hundreds with rubber gloves on, doing the odd one or two without gloves is a doddle.    Although the kids were good, was absolutely knackered, had really sore throat and croaky voice, and generally felt pretty rubbish.  Had a bit of a ‘falling apart’ on Saturday night, but made it through the weekend. Guess that’s progress from a few months ago.  Today I set my alarm for 8:30 but slept through it and woke up at 12:30!!  The rushed around madly as was supposed to be going to friend’s for lunch as it was her birthday.  Had a lovely time with her, and was pretty honest and real to (you’ll be pleased to her Mel!) Then this evening was her birthday party, except it was a murder mystery party in panto! (anyone from Canada - do you have pantomime?) So we were all normal people (well not that normal actually – there was Cass Strate, the local vet; Nosomo King; Stu Dumpling, the local butcher – that was me!; Annie Seed, the sweetshop owner…..) then we were in this local production of Aladdin – I was Widdow Twanky. The director had been murdered and we had to work out who it was.  Fortunately I wasn’t the murderer because I am totally hopeless at lying. Was really funny and totally bizarre – my motive for murder was that the director had found out that I had been getting dead cats, dogs, snakes and fish from the local vet and making them into pies!  I HATE dressing up, but it was so ridiculous that it was ok. I went to a charity shop and bought this AWFUL dress; wore stripey tights; a grey curly wig; an old cardigan; and had two balloons down my dress for an enormous bust! (they were even fairtrade balloons actually!) Will NOT be showing you the photos!   So I am off to bed now –since it is 00:37!    Oh am going to start a good quotes thing, so if you have any suggestions email me them.
