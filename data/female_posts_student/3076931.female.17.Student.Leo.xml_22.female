I remember coming home and crying to my mom about it.  Lucky for me, that has been the only account (that I remember) that I've had to deal with that kind of stuff.  Especially since I've grown up in farragut...a small close-minded town.  And that really makes me happy.  I really don't feel skin color is an issue when it comes to my friends or whatever.  I never feel out of place because of the color of my skin. And I love that.  I am comfortable in my own skin and I don't care that I'm a different color nor do any of my friends care. That's why I can joke around about my "brown-ness" with people and people can call me brown.  It's a fact...I'm brown..So why should it not be spoken of? When my family goes out to eat with another couple ( usually a white couple) and the waiter asks, "how shall the check be split"..My parents just simply state "We brown people on one check". It's funny cuz the waiters never know how to react..They kinda nervously laugh it off and they're like oooh okay. We know we're brown, you know we're brown...So why not just state it point blank?       That then brings me to the whole southern pride, rebel flag deal. I mean I know I'm not black... But it's just so offensive to me. It makes me so angry to see all that around..And it's everywhere cuz we live in Tennessee. I saw a kid wearing a shirt that said "The South will Rise again". Seriously, people...You anger me. The other day me and my friends were walking down the hall and some black guys walked by and passed us..And then I heard these guys behind us go "fuckin n****** ( I don't like to say that word), I got so angry that I turned around and I said " Don't ever fucking say that ever again." I mean usually I just wouldn't say stuff like that to random people, but it just made me so mad that I couldn't even bite my tounge and it just slipped out.  It pissed me off so bad. It ruined my day. I mean I know I'm not black..But I just feel so strongly about it. Maybe it's because I'm a different skin color also but I really think I would feel the same even if I was white or yellow or red or purple or green.  When I see someone with the rebel flag hat or t-shirt or whatever and they show a strong dislikes in blacks...It makes me wonder how they feel about me...I mean I am brown.  I will never understand those people. Nor will I ever try to.  If I see someone who has a rebel flag hat on or t-shirt..I know that I do not what to get to know that person..No matter how nice he or she is or whatever.  I know I'm being judgmental..And I'm sorry. That's just how its gonna be.
