This includes grad students who are registered (but not necessarily in courses) during the summer. The subsidies are first come first serve, so get yer butt (with all the proof you'll need) to the AMS admin office soon!   Wow! something pro-student at UBC! I only hope there are enough funds for everyone to get their subsidies.
