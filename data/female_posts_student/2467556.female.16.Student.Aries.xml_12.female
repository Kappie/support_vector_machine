Mythology and Bible test tomorrow, meh....i'll study later.  Oh yeah in other news, the committee thing for the trimester-semester switch STILL hasn't frickin voted on the stupid decision.  They were suppsosed to vote on monday for the ultimate decision but said they needed more time and research before they could.  Apparently, they have to have a decision by February or nothing is going to happen next year.  Pray they put it off until after i've graduated.  Which reminds me, Me and Brittnee made up catchy shirt mottos for our junior and senior shirts.  We made it up tonight on the phone.  Here they are for Class of '06 people:  Junior shirt : '06 Your mom (we want it to be white shirt with plain arial writing for the letters)  Senior Shirt : '06 because.....um.....yeah (red shirt with whatever kind of font) ^We thought they were funny and we actually based them off of some of our inside jokes. Also there is the ever popular "Class of '06!!  we have no spirit!!! wooo!" or "Class of '06 sucks dicks", but i don't think the latter will be approved, lol.    Yeah so Mrs. Cox had another bi-polar spasm today.......she needs drugs i'm telling you! Drugs are the answer! at least for her anyways.  Siru is going to get me finnish gum yaaaay! In "finnish lessons" today during french, she said again i suck at pronunnciation.  Well excuse me for all the frickin weird sounds the finnish letters make! Lol, you know i love you Siru if you're reading this.  In aerobics today, Nadia brought the COOLEST burned cd EVER!!!  It had the Vehicle song on it and "Come on Eileen".  it was awesome.  So now i have the stupid vehicle song stuck in my head.    hmmmm hw calls, to sum today up.....it was a pretty darn good day  Niko Rocks, Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~
