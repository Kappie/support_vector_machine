There was one part where I actually had to wake up to realize that I was dreaming. It was weird. Aunt Peggy and leanne left yesterday, but it was really fun to see them. Ummm... something else to say. *think think think* Nothing's coming. Oh! Tomorrow, at the pemberville library, there is a medieval fair and I get to help out! If you want to see me in "authentic" medieval garb them give me a call or come by and see it. It's going to be fun. I think I'm about done here. I need coffee.    SO I FLEE
