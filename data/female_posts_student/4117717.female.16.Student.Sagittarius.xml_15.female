While I was crying over the obvious big thing, a lot of little things came up as well, and it just turned into a big breakdown. One long big sob fest. I remembered school will start soon. I don't want to have to deal with that shit again. Cause of school that means phsyical apperance problems. At one point I cried over how I look. How I guess I am ugly inside and out. (And please do not go "Nooo Kate..you are beautiful!" Cause I mean..that's what people are supposed to say, and I have heard it enough in my life...I've never heard that said when I don't say that about myself, only when I do. And I am not fishing for compliments, so we'll just end that.) Cause of the physical stuff I remember that...some things don't change. lol, figures the stuff I do want to change don't and the stuff that I dont want to change do. If that makes sense.  But...I'd really really really like to thank Katie and Jessica. For actually making me laugh out loud today. I didn't think that was possible at some points....so...I love you guys!
