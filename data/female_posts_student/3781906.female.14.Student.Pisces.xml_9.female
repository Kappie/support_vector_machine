This next chapter, I think, is one of the better ones. It is full of suspence and, in some cases, pretty scary things. But I'm sure nobody will have a problem with it.  Now, I'm trying to download Java so I can throw flaming banana's at my friend Jesse. What an interesting life I lead.   I'll write again soon,  Ambershai ;)
