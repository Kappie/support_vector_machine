The last fwe times didnt work so well because I kept getting stuck,a nd I couldnt getr anywhere else without sounding stupid. I like to write about vampires. Thats all I write about lol. Well, if anyone's got any ideas, tell me. *dances* Doo dee doo dee doo... Heard from David today....I havent talked to him for so long..i dont know wtf is going on, but he's been suicidal again (he gets like that, he has a mental problem, he shot himself when he was 13), well, was, rather, when I heard from him 4 months ago...I think he ran away. I dont know if he still is somewhere else now, I doubt it. Im really worried about him...  Anywhoo...I feel sick, so Im gonna go and erm..yea. Byes.
