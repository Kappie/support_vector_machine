Pretty saddening... grad's gonna be fun, but high school... it's a big step. Big step for everyone, not just couples. Friends too.  Talking to Martin these past few days have really helped me. He's made me realize so much by merely talking to me about his troubles and about his relationship with Sonia. Praise the LORD.  Ingrid just came online. Gonna talk to her about *cough*. We got interrupted at church when Erica, Karen, and other people walked in on us so yeah. Meh, whatever.  Hmm, Ingrid sent me her blog... I forgot to read it last night. But I'm so hungry right now! Ugh... I'll grab some ice-cream and then read it while I eat it! Hehe~! Or maybe I'll have a cup noodle. Iunno, whatever. But I'll finish this blog first.  Martin really got me thinking. I've been trying to put off thinking about it, but grad has me scared. In high school, there are a lot of other really pretty girls and really nice and outgoing girls. I love Nima and I can't stand EVER losing him. I'm serious. Love IS an understatement. I'd rather die than lose him. I already feel like I'm dying whenever I'm without him. It's gotten me so afraid. I trust Nima entirely, but I don't trust the girls. Really. It's not that easy for guys to walk away from a really really pretty girl who's flirting with you. I don't know... I'll definitely be praying for everyone about high school. All we need is faith and GOD.  What else can I say? Hmm, had a pretty deep talk with both Julie and Martin. That's pretty rare but it's becoming a common thing for us. Maturing? Possibly. Meh, whatever.  It's weird how I think so much and yet think so little. I think so much about other things that I don't think much about my everyday life and stuff that I need to think about daily. Wasting my thinking on the wrong things? In my opinion, there's no such thing as thinking about the wrong things unless you're being perverted.   Got a few comments from people about my "fakeness" email. A few people agreed with what I had to say and one of them, who shall remain unnamed, seemed pretty cold with me. I don't know... either I'm paranoid or it's true. Whatever. Don't care. Said all that I needed to say and that's it.  Wilfred said something about my email in his blog. I guess his way of thinking about it is true too. Meh, whatever. I did what I needed to do and I know what I want. So whatever.  My arm's getting numb from typing. Gonna go grab a bite to eat. Blog later, maybe. I'm off.
