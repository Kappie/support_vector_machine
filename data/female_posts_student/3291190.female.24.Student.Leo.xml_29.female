I built my house of glass  damned you out of fear  mistrust. That you, a mirror image, reflecting my own betrayals and lust. The Indian ink, by which I branded you, solidified your existence. Through fear I denied you, painting a portrait of ignorance. I have become a mere entity, trapped in the creation of my own game. A disjointed puzzle piece, moved by emotions, constantly rearranged. Your hollow words linger, infiltrating my lungs, until I choke on your lies. My smile reflects your insincerity because I don't trust you enough to cry. I am discouraged by my failure to elude those ominous premonitions. That our time together merely succeeded in fulfilling stereotypical definitions. You were reaching out for anyone and somehow stumbled upon me. I was too enchanted with the idea, to needy  naive. Although we never discovered forever, its promises still left us blind. My hear tangled in the memories of yesterday, forcing me to leave it behind. I felt a chill embrace my body, my lips remained too frozen to confess. That although you never really knew me, I loved you none the less.
