The more I sit around and think about leaving, the sadder I actually get. I actually like working so I can keep my mind off things. It's so sad because Ryan is never home and when he is home, I'm at work. It's going to suck so bad when I go to college and he is still here. My mom said that I can come home once a month, but you and I both know my mom and if I called for her to come get me, she would drive all night to get to me. I love that about my mom. Ryan is big into hunting and stuff so during October-December pretty much I'm never going to see him. It sucks. I know people say change is good, but right now I'm pretty happy with my life. I'm not saying that I'm not going to like college. But I already made it a goal in my life that I'm going to get as close to a 4.0 that I can in college, no matter what it takes. I want a career. A weird thing happened. I went to this church thing with my mom and there were a lot of mothers that talked and one in particular caught my attention. She said that her whole life she wanted to be a teacher. When she got through a year of college she got this feeling that teaching wasn't something the Lord wanted her to do. So she prayed about it and she just knew that she was supposed to be an accountant. Something similar happened to me. I was registering for classes at CMU. I said that I had intended on majoring in law when this thought went through my mind that I shouldn't be an attorney. I didn't listen and I registered for some law classes. Last night I had this dream that I became a psychiatrist. Weird, I talked to Ryan about it, and because of the many problems that I have been through, I might actually be able to help someone because I probably experienced something similar in my lifetime. I don't know...what do you think? I honestly think it might be a good career that I could deal with. Anyway, I have to go. I love you Kira. I'll talk to you soon!          Peace and Love,    Melissa
