Yesterday I went to my lab as per usual... and I was going to go to Austin that afternoon so that I could attend Mr. Sinus Pretty in Pink last night with Ricky, Wolf, and Melissa.  So, Ricky called when I was at home, and said they were going to go to the store to get pink hairspray... so I asked him to just wait til I got there because it was only going to take me an hour to drive up.  So, once I got there, we changed (well, Ricky and I did) and then Ricky called Melissa and told her to come over so that we could go on.  So, we stopped and got some pink hairspray, and then went over to Jeff and Marta's house in Round Rock (North of Austin).  Their house is so wonderful!  I imagine that is how my brother and sis-in-law's place will look once it's all done.  After we visited for awhile, we went back to the apartment... Ricky, Wolf, and I grabbed some food from TC's to eat before we left to go to the Drafthouse.  So, after about 25 minutes or so, and a can of pink hairspray later, we were ready to leave.  The show was pretty good.  I think that I enjoyed as much as I did because Owen wasn't there.  He's my least favorite... and anyhow, the jokes were pretty funny.  They made a LOT of sex jokes that cracked me up.  Then during the "Stop the Movie!" part, Jerm, who was dressed as Duckie serenaded Melissa and I to Otis Redding's Try a Little Tenderness (as Duckie does to Andie in the movie).  He decided to step onto our little table thing... and well.... It would've worked out much better had he not slipped on the menu that was laying on the table top, and in the process of which falling (mostly on Melissa) Melissa and I and knocking over my cup of water, which spilled all over....!  hehehe  It was SO FUNNY!  Anyway, so, then we went back to the apartment after chatting with Alexis and her two friends for awhile and got things together to drive to San Antonio.  Then today we all went to Druck's musical, Sweet Charity, at St. Phillip's.  They did an okay job.  I mean, you honestly shouldn't expect it to be like a professional production... but they faired well considering the limited number of crew people they had.  A lot of the cast had to double as cast AND crew members.  Plus, in the first act the fire alarm went off and we all had to evacuate the auditorium.  And then it went off again... but we didn't have to evacuate that time.  I may decide to go back next weekend... but I probably won't have time.  We have that option to make up for the disturbance of the fire alarm going off in the beginning of the first act.  :-)  However, I will most likely be attending a party next weekend... and then Saturday is the drumline state championships.... and then Sunday... is something.  I don't know what, but something.  Probably mostly getting some studying in.  Anyhow... this week should be very nice!  :-D  That's all for now.
