Down load Private Eye by Alkaline Trio and if you don't get hooked on it and sing it for the rest of the day then you're mad! I'm singing it all the time and no one gets it! (Doh!) Hehe, sorry about your purse Laura! Some how I managed to break it! Oops! Then I was walking home and every one had foam so I put my super fast speedy shoes on and kind of half ran past them, but my brother's gonna get super soakers for tomorrow! AARGH! Don't worry, I'll just use Izzy as a shield! Muhahaha! Ok, so moral blogging! Katie Vile is being mean! So smeg to her! We all support you Lynne, and we will in any way that we can so we're here and uhh... yeah... Well, her last name is Vile isn't it! I recon the people around her don't actually like her and are just afraid of her and that's the only way she can get friends... kind of gotta feel sorry for her no? In a way... A very small way... Gomen, I know! I'll shut up soon! Eek! Eugh, don't get me started on smoking... sorry, some one on msn has 'give me some money for fags' as there name. If you want to kill yourself by smoking, go ahead and do it. Slow suicide, not very nice at all.
