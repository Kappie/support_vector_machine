I started out disgusted with who I had become.  We all have those fantasies and thoughts when we are younger of what we will be like when we're older.  I can still remember being about 10 years old, being so thrilled to have a double digit age.  It excited me so much of what high school and being a teenager were all about, though I still had a few years to be there.   But it was fun just imagining the possibilities and planning my future.  Now that I'm here--the whole teenager/high school realm--I'm not sure I  like it that much.  In fact, I am positive that most times it absolutely sucks.  And that scares me because as eager as I am planning for my future, I don't want to be disappointed again.  Is the rest of my life going to be like this?  I know that my problems in the big scheme of things seem insignificant to an onlooker,  but to me, this is all I know.  My life--right here, right now.  It is a big deal because as I see the days, months, and years passing ever so quickly, the more I desire for a better life.  And I am creating a better life.  But it seems like everything I am doing isn't satisfactory to me.  Maybe it's that I need to change my sights and goals, but I seriously don't think that the things I  am working for are that outlandish.  And while it has been hard learning that there's no such thing as perfection and that everything is not always black and white, shouldn't I only desire the best for myself?  But just those crucial realizations I have made--and there are many more--are great acheivements.  Some people live their whole life before realizing what I have already learned.   And for that I am blessed.  To have opprotunities to discover these things.  That in itself is a big accomplishment.  But I always want more...my heart is restless.
