So this is the last blog entry before I go. It's about time to pack up the computer and put it in the suitcase. There's something about disconnecting everything that makes me feel sad. I have to shower, and then pack the rest of my bathroom stuff. And then, pretty much, I'll be all good to go.  I haven't been the best child lately. It's almost like a soap opera or something. Someone delivers a weighty piece of news and you have to wait until tomorrow night 9/8C to find out what happens next, except there's nothing like that for me. So I've been thinking about it all day. Certainly, it curbs some otherwise unstoppable desires.  I'll just lay low until it's time to leave.
