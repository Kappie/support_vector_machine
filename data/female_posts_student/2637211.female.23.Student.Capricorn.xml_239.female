This weekend we're going to go camping with Dave and Alexa, and last night we went over to their house for dinner with another couple. At first, it was kind of silly and funny how Jerm wouldn't stop talking about camping, and it seemed like he was just trying to be prepared. But as Alexa, Dave and I all told him to calm down, we'd take care of everything the next day (all of us are home on Fridays), he got more and more tense and crazy. Finally we had to leave, because he was really anxious about getting all of the stuff together. When we got home, he and I argued about his behavior, and he got all mean and passive aggressive about how "you said you'd do it all, I'm not going to help you at all." Finally I just stopped arguing and stopped speaking to him for the rest of the evening. I put some stuff together, then I went to bed. He stayed up another hour or so being loud and packing, playing the martyr. The thing that pissed me off the most was that throughout our fight, I tried to end the fight and get him to relax for a minute, but he couldn't let it go. He couldn't keep himself from adding in one more rude and snotty comment. This morning he was soft and quiet, but I'm still somewhat irritated that he thinks I'm not competent enough to pack and take care of things. He always assumes that I won't be able to do anything, and anything I do seems to surprize him, like he didn't think I was capable. I know we have a lot more tension because I'm living here full time, but this lack of trust and faith in me is getting bad. I suppose we'll have a "talk" tonight in the car.
