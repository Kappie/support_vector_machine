I mean, I'm reading stuff right now, and apparently I'll be getting an assignment on some topic that I'm to write an admissibility report on (see  urlLink my internship's website ), but as of right now, just reading, reading, and more reading for me.  Some in Spanish, more in English.  Good practice, not so exciting stuff...stuff that I've read over and over again!
