Here's a teaser, but you should read the whole thing because it rocks. (As much as B. O'R can "rock," of course... I use the term loosely.)  "If President Bush loses, it will be his own fault. For some reason, he refuses to explain the issues that are defining his administration so the folks can understand what the deuce is going on. Bush's policy in Iraq has gone south, but it is not a lost cause. All wars have reversals, and it is the commander-in-chief's duty to rally the troops. Do you feel rallied? I don't."   As my friend Amy-Louise's middle school friend Tiki used to say, "If you can't speak the sweet truth, speak the cold truth."  Heh.   (By the way, Bill: nice use of the word "deuce."  I would have preffered "fuck" but I guess the News is a family paper.)  I of course, do NOT agree with the nonsense about Kerry and the left.  The fact that he has the audacity to even mention billionaire political ties is astonishing.  But such hypocrisy has always been the hallmark of those doggone republicans, so whatever. I'm used to it. It's almost endearing! Sike. Anyhow.  Anyhoos, if you want to read the whole glorious article, you can probably find it lots of places.  I found it on the Daily News.   http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/196294p-169553c.html  *For the unititiated, or those of you who were not ever a female in junior high, BFF means Best Friend Forever. I am course exaggerating.  O'Reilly will surely return to arch-enemy status manana.
