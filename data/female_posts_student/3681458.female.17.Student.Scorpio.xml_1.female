There were maybe about 8 or 9 of them and they were watching me in the window.  One of them came in, got a carmel apple.  And as I was handing it to him, he says, "Damn you look good." I just smiled and rang him up.  Then he was like, "do you have a b/f?" no, but I'm probably too young for you.  "How old are you?" 17.  Are you in school? "No, how bout I take you out to dinner tomorrow night?"   Note to Guys Pursuing Me: There is nothing wrong with telling a girl you think she looks good, and there's nothing wrong with asking her on a date.  But you've only had a 2 minute conversation with me, tops.  How do you know I'm your type.  And also, I'm not the type of girl who would go out w/someone who's name I don't have just to have "fun".  Good lord, step up and act like a man.  Ask me for my number, get to know me.  Then we shall see.
