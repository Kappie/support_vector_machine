I had to turn off the sounds for AIM cuz when   too many people   IM you, the ring ring, moo's and burps...get quite annoying.   *sigh*   Man, forget livejournal, this seems much better. Is there a such thing as boring yourself...To DEATH!? I mean, what the flip? But I have a crudload of ppl on Yahoo now and....The Yahoo high-pitched "rrrriiinnng" is getting annoying too. I'll listen to my music. I'm pretty dumb, I was sitting here with the headphones in, sulking about the sounds of Yahoo. It's like how I ran into that door at Wal-Mart, thinking it was an automatic door. Some people walk into it, but I ran into it. It's like one of those stunts you see on TV.   *sigh*   My lil bro got a kick outta it tho.   "Kristen ran into a door! Hahahahahahahahaha!!!"   Funny. I laughed.   *rolls eyes*   I guess it would've been funnier...if it happened to someone else. I think that's stupid tho... How are you gonna sit there and be  pissed off  when something   "funny"   happens to you and laugh when it happens to someone else? I hate that. Some people just suck.   About a month ago, me and 2 friends were walking thru one of the stores at   Six Flags Over Georgia   and they had a lil   "  CAUTION:WET FLOOR"   yellow sign thingy out that sits on the floor and I was like "I bet you a million bucks the floor's not even wet now! Watch!" and went running toward the sign....Icrashed into a buncha Powerpuff Girl beanie babies. There were stains from the floor on my khaki shorts.....  *sigh*   Another day in the life of stupid me. People call me blonde, but most of my blonde friends are smart. Accept maybe Maya...But that's probally cuz she's always on something all the time..  jk, jk!!   *looks around nervously*    cool, bold. Orange Bold...Or Bold Orange.. Which one sounds right?  Have you ever had an itch on your right leg...and when your done scratching it, you scratch your left leg too, just to have things even....or am I the only one? I have a friend, online, who was told if you gargle paroxide it will make your teeth whiter. When she did it her gums also turned white. Being the idiot that she is, she panicked and drank red Kool-Aid to turn her gums back pink. Needless to say her newly whitened teeth were also red...wow. Something even stupider that happened to me..Well, that I did. Me and some friends went to the mall and I was checking out some clothes near the dressing room and I glanced over and thought I'd seen a girl with the same outfit as me on...I didn't want to stare, and make her think I was a freak, so I leaned over to my friend and was like "I think that girl has the same outfit on as me, just don't stare." So, she glanced over real quick and looked back at me, then her brow arched and she looked back at the girl, while I'm freaking out "Don't look, don't look!" and she rolled her eyes and said "Kristen, i think that's a mirror." Man, That was one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my life....   *sigh*   When I was about 6 or 7, me and my parents were over my grandparents house..visiting. Every time we went, I always went on a scavenger hunt cuz they have the weirdest, coolest, most ancient things in their house. I went to go play dress up one day and I think my parents had left, leaving my grandparents to babysit me..I put on lipstick, gma's old jewelry, high-heels...I was looking around for perfume...Couldn't find any, so I decided to go thru my gma's purse, and found a lil spray bottle. It looked like perfume to me, so I sprayed it on with my eyes closed..and when I was all done, I opened my eyes to go look in the mirror again and I   SCREAMED BLOODY MURDER...   I ran out into the living room and both my gparents came running. I still had the bottle in my hand and gave it back to my gma and tried to explain through tears that I was trying to smell pretty like her and she looked at the bottle and smiled at me, she gave it tomy gpa and I could see him *almost* laugh at it..I was like "Why is it funny!?" and she hugged me tight and said, "Honey, that wasn't perfume you tried to spray... It's mace. ......At least it was when I was 6, and not now that I'm alot older... Anyway, why is it that when most ppl are being stared at, they freak out and liek every 5 seconds, they get the urge to stare back to see if the other person's still looking at them? And if they are, the other person usuallylooks away real fast pretending that they weren't just staring at the other person? It's a never-ending thing, the both of them looking back and forth. Sometimes it starts fight...It's quite amusing. Do they stare and if caught, be like "Darn, I was caught! Billy, Billy! I was just caught!" and Billy says "Oh no! Man down, man down!!! He's been caught, seeking medical attention! Bob? Bob, can you hear me, man? How many fingers am I holding up?" lolz, that's a cute lil thing Jojo came up with the other day. WBL. Oh yeah, go  urlLink here . To read about what happened with Cindy last night. :P~~~ PeAsH!!
