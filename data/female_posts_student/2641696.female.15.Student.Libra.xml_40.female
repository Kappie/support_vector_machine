All that is left is the VB part of the comp.sci. assignment, but since I don't have anything remotely resembling VB here at home, I'll do it tomorrow after school. Yayy! I am pleased. Except I hate my printer. It took two flipping hours to print everything. I mean wtf?! It's just absolute insanity. Except me da keeps saying the only way it works properly is if you're nice to it. So next time I'll try that. Yelling at it seems to be futile, soo...   I might like technology, but it sure as hell hates me o_O
