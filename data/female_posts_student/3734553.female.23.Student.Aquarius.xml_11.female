In my dream I was doing a thrown-in, and I must have been making the actual movement with my hands because I slammed my arm into the bookcase beside my bed. I now havea killer bruise and it hurts to flex my hand.    I know all my posts have been about running into people I haven't seen but i had something different happen tonight. This girl came in who I wasn't really friends with in school. But being a small town we grew up together, knew each all our lives, had all the same classes, yada yada yada. Anyway, in school she was really kind of annoying and got my nerves, a very self-involved person. But tonight it was amazing. She was unbelievably nice and sincere. And it was just good to talk to her. Which is something I never thought I would say about her. I guess that is just part of growing up and coming into your own.    Or I could just be starved for conversation in this hell-hole of a town. Two weeks left.
