Due next friday and take some time off to seriously go thru hong lou meng n do the assignments.       intend to write abt my relationship with ah mah in my third chuang zuo. sometimes i feel really lucky to have her around me cos she's always tt concerned abt me. =) the first thing she'll ask when i stepped home is " taken ur lunch/dinner?" besides tt she'll always be the one who's worried abt me. it's really heart warming to know that someone in this world actually worries if u've eaten and if u're hungry. i've been with her since the day i was born and we've always been v close. we talk abt many things..from gossips to guys..haha..actually i intend to get her a v special birthday gift this year(her birthday's in oct) but still clueless abt wad to get for her. i'm really lucky n fortunate to have her around=) thanks ah mah..i hope to share all my memories with her.   i am really thankful to have her around. basically i'm leading a pretty happy life now and i think one will only be truly happy is he/she is contented mentally and material luxuries will not give someone contentment in the long run. so be thankful for wad u have n count ur blessings      just received a call from kim. she's also ponning sch tml to go to IKEA with her mum. haha..we're 2 of a kind. but connie's coming cos her mum dun allow her to pon sch. poor connie. so kim n i will have a long,pleasant n sweet weekend.        humph!  loi is a betrayer   =P
