Before leaving the house I got that meaningless piece of paper in the mail, what I am talking about you ask...my report card. I ripped it open only to find that I was offically fucked. I went from making my parents proud to Damn our daughter is stupid..at least that's the way their treating me. Last semester I had pretty awesome grades.. my accumilated GPA was 3.5...haha now it's a 2.8. I went from being 54th in our class out of 576...to 124th out of 533. I came out with my worst final grade being a D+, in Honors Algebra. from there it was C-,C,B,B,A. I mean in all honesty it's not that bad, of course I could do better but it's not horrible...think AGAIN, my mom is having a heart attack over it. Not only is she appalled at my "preposterous" grades but by my "un-heard of" number of tardies. Ok yeah 79 in one year is alot. But i mean come on, it's not that bad.   As I told you before today is my dad's birthday, so I went and got him ballons and a card and delivered them to his office. There I ran into Jackie (one of his many ex's) and she hugged me and all that, asking me how I've been. So we're talking and Trish (the major bitch) comes around the corner and then I dunno why but the two start going at it, yelling and al that stupid shit. I HATE when people fight(I guess it was just one of those natural territory type of things with chicks I dunno)so for some insane reason they start yelling at each other, I seriously was waiting for these two adults in their nice professional buisness suits to duke it out right then and there, but they didn't they just kept yelling. Everyone's heads are now peeking out and over their little cubicles and out of the doors of their offices.All the little secreteries are shuffling over to each others desks starting the office gossip. It was like I could see everything that was going on. So then my dad came out and joined in on the yelling. I left , I doubt any of them noticed , I mumbled Happy Birthday ..this was the best one yet as I left. It was sad , I felt so grown up then because of how childish these three adutts were acting.   Olivia...sorry sorry sorry sorry!! You know I love you and I'd never say anything that you wouldn't want other people to know! KISSES muah!!   I'm done for now...maybe I'll write later
