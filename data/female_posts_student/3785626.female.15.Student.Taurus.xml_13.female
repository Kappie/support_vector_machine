Anyways I didn't flat NOTHING today...Isn't that just the it? I woke up around 11 o'clock cause I really didn't want to mow the grass, but I should have. I wanted to go to Starkville but my brother likes being a butt and would not take me. Maybe he'll take me tomorrow?! Hopefully...Anyways...life is pretty boring for me. So um..guess that's it.
