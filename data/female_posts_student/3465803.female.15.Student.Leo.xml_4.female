My friends are lying to me out of their asses, or so I think, Im not sure weather to belive them or not but come on I dont belive she knows Tony or is going out with Seb. I feel something because part of me belives this and a part of me doesnt.... Im sure the bigest majority of me belives it because Im to gulible so the bigest majority of my feelings is probably jelousy. I mean, she may be 15 but she could be telling the truth. I wanna cry because Im a sore lozer and I have nothing else better to do,but I cant jusr because that one part of me is fighting over my whole body except my heart. I cant even feel that anymore. Its like dead tissue thats decaying and rotten. It hurts so bad really really bad and I dont understand it. I dont even kow what jelousy is. I never been jelous of any one or anything. I wasnt jelous of Linzi, why am I jelous of her? Its not right not right at all. Oh happy late birthday Seb i will always love you. Keep representing.   -Jamie
