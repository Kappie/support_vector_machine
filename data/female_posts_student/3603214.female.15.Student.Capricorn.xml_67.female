One is Bob and the other is Aloicious *Al-owe-ish-us*...Aloicious is awesome...he's the dumb one...we're tight like margerine. One day the world will meet him and he will be loved. His nickname is Squishy, btw. Enough about that...I'm gonna discuss the convo Am-beer n I are having. Jesus DID have half-brothers and sisters because it's like impossible for Mary to have been a virgin all her life. *sigh* yea...that was the highlight of the convo..i don't need to go into detail... Godspell isn't as bad...there's 55 in the cast now...and I think they're continually dropping. Our Judas *Tony* might drop out. He's not happy w/ the Curtain's Up ppl and he didn't really wanna b in it...he's in a Muny show so that's more important than crappy community theater...I don't blame him. O yea, Tasha, I asked if he knew u n he was like 'the last name doesn't ring a bell' SoOoOoO...lol. I tried. He stepped on me when we were working on "Day by Day". I almost lost a flip flop. Some of the scariest two seconds of my life. I'm still stuck w/ one line. There's this one kid who has like a billion and I'm slightly offended. Okay, so it's more like ten. But that's nine more than most of us. GRRRR. I can't drop out because I feel obligated now. And a couple more ppl I know finally showed up to rehearsals, so maybe it won't b that bad. Maybe it's all for the best...someone has to be opressed...YES! it's all for the best! lol...if you've never seen Godspell or it's kinda foggy, you wouldn't understand that. OMG! I watched Meet the Parents the other day and when they ask Ben Stiller to say grace, he recites the lyrics to Day by Day..I never realized it...That is like the most brilliant thing in the world. Since I'm now obsessed w/ this show, and I dunno if anyone truly relates w/ me, I'll shut up about it now... :)
