Does anyone have any suggestions? And nothing like "shave it" or "dye it green" or anything like that. Serious suggestions only. Well, it's this time of night I start feeling sorry for myself so I'm just going to leave you with some Rooney lyrics before I start getting all "life sucks" and shit.  Listening to: [Rooney]   Can you guess Why I haven't called you back Well I said I'm screening calls Even your calls Why am I such a bad guy I'm just doing other things Like you do other things I could never really love you Simply because simply because I could never really love you Simply because of the trust  You're up all night Fixing your hair But you're not satisfied With that I'm satisfied I'm doing things like I said before I'm not partying I'm partying from the non-creative I could never really love you Simply because simply because I could never really love you Simply because of the trust You've lost my love  -Simply Because- Rooney
