That works for me, probably bores you, the reader, who is reading this. lol, sorry if it does. If it just gives you something to read and you really do not mind it, then I am glad :-)  Overview for the day: -Leaving for school around 9:30 to arrive at 9:35. Then I intend to wander until 9:45 and then find friends who just got out of their third period finals. At 9:55-ish, I will go to my Spanish class then begin the final at 10:00 and end at 12:00.   -Home, to do ... nothing? Probably clean...if I can make myself do it :- -Organize some more FOCC stuff so that I have something to talk about at tonight's meeting  -Help a friend with a problem  -Meeting tonight from 6:00 - ? usually 8:30. Jay should be back which means that I will have Project C.R.E.A.T.E. also.   -Hopefully talk to my one and only. It is such an awesome feeling when all you have to do it think about someone and you cannot help but smile and feel completely uplifted. I smile a lot now :-)    Hm, I could have slept in today, and hre I am....wide awake at 6:30. For whatever reason I was waaaaay too tired last night. I could not stay awake. I think it is just the rapidly changing weather accompanied by finishing out school. So close.  Well, I hope everyone has a great day and to talk soon!  Matt, gracias por todo que hagas. Me amo ti mucho!
