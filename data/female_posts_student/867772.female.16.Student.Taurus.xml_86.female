It's not that I haven't wanted to write, and it's incredibly, undoubtedly not because I haven't had anything to write about.  Let's just not make this post be about how I haven't posted in a long time, because that shit belongs not in this blog.  I'm in Grease. The rehersals consist of singing, dancing, and blocking, seeing as I am "just chorus people". Despite the fact that I am an inferior being upon the stage, I love it, and I'm sticking with it. Three hours a day, three days a week. I'm spending a lot of time-I-didn't-have-in-the-first-place on this musical.  Guys: the usual. Sometimes, they make me so happy I'm alive, I wouldn't trade it for anything (not that I have much to trade my life for...but that's beside the point.) Other times, they make me want to cry until it is literally, physically impossible to cry any more. Yet most of the time, they just make my want to kick them in the balls repeatedly until they're too numb to feel a school bus crawling up their inner thigh, slice their stomachs with the dullest blade I can find (perhaps a foil would do...or maybe...a rusty spoon...), artistically disembowel them, and let them marinate in their own blood for a few hours before hanging them from a streetlight and entertaining myself by seeing how far their tongues would come out of their mouths. Whatever, boys will be boys.  I read  urlLink Forever...  by Judy Blume. Very graphic.  urlLink My next victim.   I didn't get to watch the Grammy's because I had to finish my English term paper. Words can describe just about anything with the exception of how pissed that made me.  I need a shower. See y'all soon, I promise.
