The title of the play is Tatarin one of the most popular written works of Nick Joaquin. The 1st 2 scene is kinda boring but as the plays goes on, its all good... and in that day I've known Lex Marcos and we became friends. The crowd is shouting and they are all enjoy the play. Its so nice to be there...
