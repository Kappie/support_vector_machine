Matt and I were talking about theories of reality, we were theorizing where Heaven and, consequently, Hell exist.  What we came up with was the possibility that Heaven and Hell exist in an “alternate” place.  When we are children in Sunday school we are taught that Heaven is in the sky and Hell is in the ground. It becomes obvious that that is as metaphorical as everything else in the bible, still it exists, as a good way to teach children the distinction between our religious places of good and evil.  So, if we don’t dance on the clouds when were good and sink to the pits of fire within the earth when we die, where do we go? I suppose the answer is that no one still living really knows –even though there are those who claim to know based on “near-death” experiences, which I will get to in a little while.  I asked Matt, “Do you believe that when we die, we gain all the knowledge of the universe?”  To that he answered, “If you assume that heaven and hell exist in an ‘alternate’ place or reality, then do we not have the answers already?”  All of this was provoked by one of, if not the, most brilliant scientific mind of our time, or any time really.   urlLink Stephen Hawking , is a theoretical physicist who has some very interesting ideas, most, of which I am fairly sketchy on, I intend to do more looking.  Until then, check out his website, I think you will find it very interesting!    I am in possession of a St. Joseph edition, New American Bible –a Catholic Bible- and within its pages is a diagram of  urlLink   “The world of the Hebrews.”   In this diagram, it outlines the Hebrew conception of the world.  It is an interesting belief, from way back, that my Bible calls a “prescientific concept.”  God gave us the ability to think, if we neglect to use it we defile our purpose on this planet to begin with.  All theories aside, science truly doesn’t know exactly when the universe began (an estimated 15 billion years ago) and neither do theologians.  There are great many things that could be said for science, its measurements and who could leave the  urlLink “Big Bang Theory”  out in the cold. Still there are religious scholars who look back with awe on God’s creation and completely disregard the scientific possibilities.  Why can’t there be a middle ground?  Is it so hard to believe that science could measure and record the miracles that God gave us?  Perhaps for some it is too much to hope for, or believe, but it is certainly not for me.    There are those who would take the “big bang theory” and apply it very easily and neatly to the Bible.  To the surprise of many, it works.  After all, God had to begin somewhere right? There are others who say that dinosaurs never existed –even though we have entire skeletal structures to prove that they did- simply because their existence is not in the Bible.  Still there are some Bibles that speak of  urlLink Unicorns  and dragons, yet we do not have any physical proof that such beasts ever existed. Perhaps they are all mistaken; Genesis outlines the creation of the world, in seven days.  I have given this a LOT of thought, stop and think for a moment that it is very possible that seven days to God is not 24 hours on the clock.    In the realm of mans time, which God exists both inside and outside of, how could be so narrow as to believe that god had a Rolex?  Genesis 1:3-5 says “Then God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from the darkness. God called the light ‘day,’ and the darkness he called ‘night.’  Thus evening came, and morning followed –the first day.”  There are not very many that have stopped to wonder how much of this held metaphor and how much held actuality.  Consider this; because the world is round, and it spins on is axis, while circling the sun –hence day, night, and the changing of the seasons- the light constantly shines on half the world.  From God’s point of view, it was always day and always night.    The point of all of this is, if the world has existed for an estimated 15 billion years, isn’t it possible that a day to go was several thousand years, or perhaps more?  So, that being assumed true, there was plenty of time for Dinosaurs to have lived and grown extinct, perhaps God decided to create people and wanted them to be at the top of the food chain.  Dinosaurs DID exist; we have fossils and skeletons to prove it.    There are a ton of theories that lead the world into existence,  urlLink Darwin  (Who was believed to be a Christian) spoke of evolution (it is important to note that none of his ideals every contradicted or berated the bible in any way) and the popular Big Bang Theory. So, if God’s not on our watch, and things are not always to be taken literally, why do so many insist on being closed minded about both religion and Science.  That’s not really for me to say, and I have more to get to, so let’s get on with it.  I was reading about  urlLink  “near-death” experiences , and I must sat that the evidence to prove their existence is overwhelming in the favor of such an idea.  There are those who have nearly died and come back telling of the afterlife.  My question would be, if God intended us to know and understand the afterlife, wouldn’t this happen more often?  I am a firm believer that the only way to know what happens when you die is to die.  The Bible tells us that Heaven is like nothing else and that it is a place of unimaginable happiness, a paradise inherited by those who follow the lord.  I believe all of this, with all of my heart.    By the same token, I was watching a show called urlLink  “In search of…”  which air’s on the Sci-fi network.  This show tells tales of the “strange but perhaps true” and it is irresistible to me.  I sat and watched this show non-stop for nearly an entire day once.  During this day, I came across the story of a man who was a Pagan and had a near death experience, except unlike most who say they came back from paradise, he claimed he had gotten a glimpse into hell.  As unusual as it was, he is a Christian now, and never intends to return to that hell he had barely escaped from.   Like all of my other ranting and raving, this one has a point.  Perhaps, outside of what I am personally willing to believe, I can open my mind and consider that “near death experiences” could be real.  I had made the assessment that perhaps we are not meant to know the afterlife until we die.  Flip the coin, and an argument could be made that God gives us these surreal experiences to entice us, to show us his promises are real, or perhaps to let us know that we are moving along the wrong path.  Whatever the case, we cannot possibly know.  So, weather or not “near death experiences” are real, or Unicorns really exist, faith, the promise of paradise, and the need to know what we are not privy to understand drive us.  There are those who want and need for proof that God exists, that there is life after death, and that there is a meaning to life.  To them I say, simply, “Proof defies faith.”  “Proof defies faith.”  ~ Kristyn
