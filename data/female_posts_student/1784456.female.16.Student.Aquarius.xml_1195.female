(Err... what a bad typing error!) *LIFT. She gave me a LIFT home! (Ahh better!) So I'm happpyyy! And my piano teacher gave me a present and a card! And I didn't give her any thing! Beginning to feel a bit guilty now... hell yeah. I had some thing supremely funny to say... but... it's gone. Hell! (Hell?) Nm. Well today was freezing! Like minus freezing! But I'm okay now! I'm wearing about five layers!!! Mmm, Izzy you need to phone me about staying at your house, otherwise I might be stuck at my house when my brother's having his party! I'll be stuck in my room with drunk people downstairs! Ahh! I'll probably be afraid to use the loo! Oh that was it! My tv got stuck at 6.45, on the news so it's frozen with this freak guy on saying 'Live 6.45' at the bottom! Weird huh! Better go do... interesting things... that is once I find out what they are...
