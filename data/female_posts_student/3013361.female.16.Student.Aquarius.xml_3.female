The overall plot is Viktor Navorski must stay in the JFK airport after his home country (Krakohzia) has a military coup while he's in the air. Since his passport is no longer valid because technically his country doesn't have a government anymore he must stay in the terminal and is forbidden on American soil. Its really a good movie and Tom Hanks does a wonderful job in his role.
