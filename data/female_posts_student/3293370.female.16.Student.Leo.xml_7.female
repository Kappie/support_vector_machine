This wouldn't be so bad because we'd still have a month of summer together, but the thing is I'm leaving for 2 weeks in a week and some days. Then when I get back, I might go to Notre Dame, a stay-over basketball camp, for a week. And then Mark leaves. Is it bad for me to not want him to leave? I'm going to miss him so much. Is that bad? I don't even know.
