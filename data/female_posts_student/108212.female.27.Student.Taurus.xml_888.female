Tip - after seeing Chicago, rent "All That Jazz", a thinly veiled biography of Bob Fosse, whose play this was in the first place.  Bonus factoid: ATJ was the inspiration for one of my favorite videos of all time, Paula Abdul's "Cold Hearted".  Kim had surgery today - she'll be in hospital until Monday, total recovery time 4-6 weeks.  She had a lot of pain right after the surgery, but the Demerol is helping now - as long as she doesn't cough.  Jessica's really going to have to step up to the plate and handle Alyssa (almost 19 months old now) - Alyssa still treats Kim more like she's her mom than Jess is.
