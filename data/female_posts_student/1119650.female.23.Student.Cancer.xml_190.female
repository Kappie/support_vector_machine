If I go according to my payment plan per paycheck (factoring car insurance and car payments) I will leave myself $300 to live on for 2 weeks and all of my debt (except for my car) will be paid off by May 14, 200 4 !  God, I fucking suck.  Also, all my credit cards are giong in the freezer.  I might take up a second job for this shitty summer.  Don't expect to see me going out much anymore....booo!
