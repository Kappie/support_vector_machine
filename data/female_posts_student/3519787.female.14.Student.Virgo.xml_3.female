Something i havent had in a long long long time and whenever i was with that person, i felt like i was on top of the world and i felt so alive and free and i just wish i could tell that person how much i care about them but i cant...and i cant because i screwed everything up within 5 seconds...all it took was 5 seconds and my happiness went down the drain...now, i remember when i told everyone that i will be happi and i wont ever be depressed anymore and im not depressed, im just having one of those days where it's good and bad but right now im feeling so upset and heartbroken about this that i cant help but to cry and beg god to let that person feel the same way i feel and pray that i wont be hurt anymore than i already have been, i just wish god could tell that person somehow in someway that im sorri...im truly very sorri...and i wish we could start over, plz?...
