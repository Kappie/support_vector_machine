I've been up most of tonight trying to study for history.  It's so annoying when he says... I'll give you one of THESE 9 huge broad essay topics to write about.  You have to research EVERY topic and theres no time to actually study it!  Crap, I'm going to fail.  And I need an 84 to keep my A- in that class.  Please kill me!  Or just wish me luck because this final is going to kick my butt.
