Few of you lazy imps had the motivation to put up an away message, and the other two of you haven't given me much to go on with the away message you did leave me, so I shall determine what it is that you are actually doing:   Keith - Busy saving the world from overgrown ants and crickets, using only pennies which he has to climb atop buildings and drop in hopes of squashing them one by one. It may be awhile, so leave a message if you would like, but don't expect a prompt reply.  Tiffany - Throwing rocks at boys and missing me.  Brian - Not at his computer right now, but nerding it up all the same. :)  Ben - See Brian.  Liz - Carefully avoiding work at the bank. Perhaps hiding under her desk, eating Twizlers, hoping to disguise her growling stomach so it doesn't give her away.  Elizabeth - Attempting to run away from the day campers. A valiant effort, but they will overcome her all the same.   Well, I've wasted some company time and I think I may even be more bored than I was a few minutes ago. Such is life...  One more day of work this week...
