She is a perfectionist who is never satisfied. The ever-organised Virgo is forever planning and making lists. She chooses her friends, both boys and girls with care. She prefers the company of like-minded individuals, perhaps those who are as health conscious as her. As Virgo rules the nervous system, this young girl is prone to nervousness and anxiety. She is consumed by her obsession for detail. Studious and hardworking, she always gets good grades, which gives her immense satisfaction. She is not out there to seek glory and fame, but merely the satisfaction that comes from a job well done. Relationship with her siblings may not be good as she is prone to criticise them constantly. Academically, she is inclined towards research activities. She is ideally suited to be a doctor, nurse, programmer or editor.    kim sent this to me. do u think it describes me well? haha i think to a certain extent it is true.  i put kim's n houshun's photo as my display pic just now and guessed wad? yat chun said kim looked nice. haha. finally...i finally found someone for tt fussy guy. i am so proud of myself leh..haha now kim has one more choice liao. okie i'll end here..gd night n sweet dreams =)
