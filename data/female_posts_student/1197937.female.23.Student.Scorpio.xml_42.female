I am now an official citizen of nerdville...geekdom...call it what you will. after just one day of conferencing with gaming tycoons in the likes of activision and blizzard, i have been completely brainwashed into thinking that digital gaming is the industry of the future. how shall i put this to make it clear...i once was a blank canvas, but now...i am tony hawk, best darn proskater in the world!! i feel very powerful right now. to all you ppl whom i dissed as loser/no-life/legally-braindead for spending hours submerged in a fantasy world, i owe a formal apology. video games are cool, it's all about the strategy man. but what the heck do i do when my free trial to toontown.com comes to an end? so sad...i feel like ms. mildew kookyzapper is already a part of me...  i better go read a book before i forget how.
