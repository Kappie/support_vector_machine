Let's recap: my field school was cancelled last minute, leaving me to scramble to find something else and resulting in me having to pay thousands of dollars.  Last summer I was supposed to go to southern Turkey to find a prelim project and to work with my friend Andy.  Then the war in Iraq started and the field season got cancelled.  This fall, I invested a lot of time doing research on the South Indian Neolithic in preparation for a field season with Carla, at which I would analyze the Neolithic materials for my prelim paper.  The field season got cancelled at the last minute due to issues with the permit.  I am supposed to start a project in Montenegro in three weeks- the permit was obtained, the funding is at hand, and we've bought the plane tickets.  Two days ago serious ethnic conflict erupted in Kosovo for the first time in 5 years.  Kosovo borders Montenegro.  The conflict involves Serbians.  This does NOT bode well, especially since the violence does not appear to be abating.   Why?  What is this?  Is someone trying to tell me something?  Maybe I shouldn't be an archaeologist?  Maybe I just choose shitty places to dig?  I guess in a way I set myself up for this.  I mean, I'm scheduled to be in Jerusalem in May and June.  Yeah, that's a stable place.  Sigh.    But, to note- I'm not sure yet that my trip will get cancelled, and I haven't even talked to Bob about it.  But I can't imagine that widespread looting/burning/killing/rioting can go on for long without the Serbs getting involved (the last time this happened WE ended up bombing the crap out of the Serbs to make them stop the war), and at that point, I can't see how we could go.  Sniff, sniff, sniff.  And here I thought I'd actually get to have a good, normal field season.
