And you've always had possession of it, just that you took it for granted, although you know that you're not supposed to take anything for granted.  I did a lot of thinking this whole holiday. About life in general. Hah. "I'm only 15 going 16!" you say. But I say, "I'm already 15 going 16!" and i've not carved out a plan for my future. I  need  to know whether what i've been doing is essential, yet at the same time, I just want to live like an average 16 years old. My studying now, is simply an investment for the future. To secure my place in the irritatingly competitive world. You see, I abhor the competition. Humans should not live in this way. I always dream about settling down in some rural mountaineous area in New Zealand or something, perhaps rear a few cows and eat cheese everyday. Hahaha! Ok damn it. It's just a dream anyway.. Wake Up Winnie! But, this is how the world works, so why go against it? I say, I'll just go with "the way the world works" and be  even  better than "the way the world works". Not to prove to anybody or anyone [ok sama. hahah!], but to be better than what i've been achieving all these while.  In fact, i've realised how much I love to study. Really. I'm not buying the idea so that I can study. But yea, I like the sense of satisfaction. =] I feel so unbelievably aghast by the way I am typing this. Hahaha!  I wonder how some promiscuous people are gonna live for the rest of their lives. Won't they have a "ying yin" or something? Ok, i digressed.  I just love me. WOO! =D I'm not exactly different now i guess. I'm still me.  I've decided to not come online except on perhaps Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays? This would be a gradual change. Everything takes time anyway.  For a start, I should start sleeping earlier and waking up earlier. AHHH!
