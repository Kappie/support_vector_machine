The highlights (from class, not the show, which I didn't see as I never watch the halftime show at the Super Bowl):  "I don't even have cable, so breasts on my television are a strange occurrence" and "How do you spell pasty?"  Both quotes are from my professor.  Incidentally, there seems to be some debate about whether a pasty was involved at all.  But I guess that just goes to show that one man's pasty is another man's nipple ring.    I would also like to disavow all claims that I do indeed know how to spell "pasty."  Any correctness of my spelling is purely coincidental.  Oh, yeah, and by the way, the Pats won.  This was  urlLink promptly followed by riots in Boston .  Damn yankees.  But, still I say, GO PATS!
