Anyways, today was just a driving day, basically... We spent pretty much the whole day in the car, and it was a pain, I guess. I probably listened to about eight CDs on the way. We also stopped at three McDonald's restaurants. That was insane. Anyways, the weather is kinda lousy up here... It's pretty foggy and rainy, so we'll see if we end up doing anything tonight. I might end up hitting the weight room or something stupid like that.      Last song I listened to:   Master Of Puppets  by Metallica.    Last album I listened to:   S  M .    Last meal I ate:  Bacon ranch salad at McD's.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I do not know    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.    Last person I talked to:  Dan, for like a split second :P.    Favorite song today:   Jump In The Fire  by Metallica.    Favorite food today:  Chocolate graham crackers. Good snack :)    Most interesting thing I did today:  Took a few pictures in the car on the way up to Canada.    Funniest thing that happened today:  The Beer Store!
