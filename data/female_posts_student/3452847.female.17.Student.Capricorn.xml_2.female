Why did he just say do it, and why did it feel so good? Why did his hands know where to settle? Why did he say he had been thinking about me a lot, and then say, no i really have, why did he tell me my kissing was still amazing, and why did he lie about the amount of girls hes kissed... And why do i have to care, its because i DO care, and i can't help it, i've always cared, and i always will, no one understand what it is about him that makes me like him, want him, need him, care for him, and maybe love him, i can't actually think about that word. Hes always been there, always listened and always looked out for me, and understood, he was kind, considerate and so what if stubborn and always right? Thats him, i don't just like him for his good parts ;-) I like him for him, thats it, thats why, he made me feel so special, so lovely and so loved, and when it went away i couldn't cope, and i still can't cope getting too close, this is a perfect example, he kisses me a few times, and i totally blow it out of proportion, i honestly don't know if i could get back with him, but i wouldn't mind, just trying, giving him my trust, i think deep down we could make it work, he still has my heart under lock and key and i can't claim it back off him which makes it worse, if i could have taken it back then i wouldn't have this trouble to find someone else to like, to need, i can't handle the thought of him being with anyone, and me not being with him, not having his kids or being married, its what i wanted, and what i had wanted when i first met him, he was my Prince.   ~Lisa~
