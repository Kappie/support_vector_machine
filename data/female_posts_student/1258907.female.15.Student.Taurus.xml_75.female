Tis' true I smile but i also cry i may be alive but  inside, i died my mind may thump but it is still i may live but i lost my will i may breathe but i cant catch my breath i may sleep but i dream of death i may love but i also hate wheres my second chance? Is it too late? too late to change? and too late to be too late to reveal the real me
