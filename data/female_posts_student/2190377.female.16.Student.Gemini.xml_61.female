"hot pink and black toenails beneath my fucking preppy shoes it's hard to live this way confused about who i am and who i want to be unsure of what it is that others see try to be a punk, not a wannabe it doesn't quite work cause im only thirteen"  i was so... ahahhaha. wow this is an embarassing post. I dont even need to point out the... aghajgah in that so you can just laugh at it."  MOVING ON!    SCHOOL IS OVER! I am excited but also apprehensive because it is the first summer I don't have someone to latch onto everyday.  Where is my siamese twin? aaieeee.   So yesterday was the party. It was rockin. :) :) :) Thank you friends I really love you a whole lot!!!!! Sorry for being loud.  Too much caffeine... or something.  I think the best was when I tried throwing a water balloon at matt, but completely overshot and fell backwards in my lawn chair, proceeding to roll around in the grass laughing hysterically.  Or maybe when Maria or someone dared me to "hump the stump" and i started to and hit my crotch REALLY hard on a root.  Or MAYBE mud-wrestling maria and having my mommy yell at me :(  I am never ever EVER running in a swimsuit again.   baywatch... aaaaah.  the water balloons with maria and joceline.  using bio terms to describe their um... special shape.  globular!! haha...   okay enough of that. :) dadadadadadada I got some pictures developed and will scan them soon.  Ask me if you wanna see some...  i actually dont have anything interesting to say. that is rather depressing. ive been writing too much in this lately anyway
