Nothing works and i don't know why, so i end up sleeping half the day away and my mom gets mad at me cuz i didn't tell her that i can't sleep. But oh well, Gie is coming today to just help my mom get places and watch us cuz my mom thinks i can't handle Tommy. ((which i usually can't but we don't talk at all to each other so it works out fine)) I'm hungry...ima get food in a minute. What should i eat? iono yall aren't gonna answer so i'll go find out for myself. I watched Grind last night and Michael was explaining tha Josh is like Sweet Lou, He is like Matt, JC is like Eric, and Carter is like Dustin..Michael went to bed at like 10:35 oh man he couldn't stay awake on the fone so i told him to go to bed and now he's at skool...sleeping:)      gotta scoot      I LOVE MIKE        LATA MOTHER TRUCKERS!!!
