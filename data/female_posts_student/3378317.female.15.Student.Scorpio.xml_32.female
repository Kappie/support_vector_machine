"say what you wanna say here" and im like "hell fuckin no, i wanna TALK to you" and he signs off on me.   so i call him up and im like "bitch whyd tha fuk did you sign off on me, i didnt appreciate you fuckin signin off" so i start askin him all these questions about what jus went down wit mandeep and this foo flips tha script and tells me "i said like 10 good things about you and maybe one thing about me..and you think im the bad guy??" i was like "tightest guy vishal?? tightest guy? what tha fuk are you thinking?"   so this kid starts bullshitting me and thinks that i havent heard the conversation already. so then he hangs up on me. and i call back and im like "bitch why tha fuk did you hang up on me, you got tha decency to hang up on me?" and hes like "later late.." and hangs up again. so i go back online and start cussin and at this point im PISSED. and all he has to say is "my mom is here"..like you SWEAR i give a fuk.  and so i keep goin and hes like "youre the one always talkin shit about me..i never said shit about you" and im like "what tha fuk is there to say bitch, me and you went out?? we broke up?? now we rarely talk???" theres NOTHING TO SAY. yeaa sure, i was mad we broke up and yeaa i was pissed. but i shared my feelings with people i trust that wouldnt say anything, and they havent.  and on top of that he fuckin trusts Ankurs words over mine?? especially when that fag was talkin shit even while we were goin out, i bet he believed it then too. what a fckin idiot.  hes goes "i dont know why your blowin this up over a stupid question that i asked you...you wanted him to fight you" and i was like "i didnt even kno about this shit until now, i wasnt tha one that was fuckin talkin shit to mah boy" i mean what tha FUK? so this conversation lasts and lasts and let it all out, everything that i have been feeling for the past so many months. all my fckin anger about every little thing.   so then he says "you know who we should blame our life's problems on? ankur" and im like.."its sad you trusted that fagget" and IM like "later" and hes like "yo before you leave...nevermind, later" and im like "if you have fckin something to say then jus say it" and hes like "i didnt want things to go the way they did" and im like "yeaa well they did, we cant change the past...only change what happens in our futures" and hes like "yeaa we can only change the future" and hes like "jinx" and in my head im like (wtf...we arent like best buds after all this) and hes like "you kno we broke up cuz of distance, not cu we had beef, at tha time" and im like "ill see you around" and hes like "ill talk to you later peacE"  what tha fuck was that....  so then like 5 minutes later he i.m.s me again and is like "hey, if you thought i was a bitch why did you keep my utt shit in ur profile for so long" and im like "your homie bobby told me to put it in there and i said i would keep it in there for as long as he wanted me to and i dont break promises" and hes like "so you never thought differently of you and me" and i was like "well he was the one that asked me to put it in there not you" and hes like "cool cool" and hes like "i know youre still mad about the shit between you and me" and im like "no i jus think ur fucked up, straight out" and hes like "its coo, ur opinion" (or some shit)...  wtf man. yesterday i was crazy in anger.  the minute people start talking shit i cant take it, and how tha fuk are you gonna start saying shit about the past?? didnt you think it was over?? if you really thought it was over then you wouldnt bring up shit all over again.  move on.  oh and then i was like "dont even bother coming on saturday" and hes like "you want me to" and im like "i jus said dont bother"  and like, the whole reason why he was mad was because mah boy mandeep let him know that he has no future.. if he had any self esteem, any confidence he would let anyone's words affect him that much. yeah sure theres self respect but damn..  i dont know, shit is jus fucked up. i cant believe this.  how i feel?? fuckin exhausted. fuckin angry. fuckin pissed off. thats HOW I FUCKIN FEEL.  people need to learn how to fuckin shut up.   when i have shit with people, i take it to them and i regulate that shit.  i talk shit?? if i have somethin to fuckin say then i say it to their fuckin face. i aint no pussy who's gonna hide shit. imma be straight up.  everyone knows it.  yeah everyone tells their friends how they feel about different things but that is NOT the same as talking shit.  truth hurts.  mandeep, i truly feel that we are being dangerously stalked.  thanks fo still sticking with me through all of this bullshit. you mean so much to me and i cant see anything ever coming between us. love you, fa sho.  thanks fo yo comments, mean much to me and always leave me smiling. thank you.  aight well, imma go.  theres no more fuckin shit to say, if YOU HAVE A FUCKIN PROBLEM WITH ME OR IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY THEN SAY IT TO MY FUCKIN FACE BITCH.  noor
