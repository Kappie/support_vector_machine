I think of nothing but you and your kind and gentle heart  that has created a place for me in it. You bare your soul through your beautiful eyes. I look into them and I am caught in their sight. Your gaze entraps me-  I cannot turn away, for fear of them closing. There is nothing but you and I  on this earth of ours; as you stroke your hand across my face ever so gently,  brushing the hair off my face.  Leaning in closer,  I feel your breath upon my neck;  synchronized with your every heart beat. An eternity slips away as we stand there,  not moving, not speaking, just listening- enjoying the moment. Now, your breath is upon my lips as you move towards me.  I close my eyes and my pulse begins to race as I wait impatiently for the touch of your lips to be pressed against mine. I quiver at the feel of them, causing goose bumps to arise across my body. Your tenderness is shown by this kiss; which is unselfish and pure. In the midst of the sparks we created, my hands have found their place-  resting gently upon your shoulders. My fingers become tangled in your hair. They coil your locks, letting them slip through the gaps over and over again. All the while, your hands are pressed against my back- ensuring our closeness,  and reality of this moment.  A lifetime passes before our lips part. I continue to keep my eyes closed, savoring it all not wanting to suddenly wake up  and realize this was all a dream. When I do open my eyes,  my unbelieving thoughts fade away and you are all I see. I peer into your eyes once again and all I can do is smile.
