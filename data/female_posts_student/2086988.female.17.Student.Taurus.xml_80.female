And I really don't think I'm going to go to prom now. Kiera has a date, Em has a date and plus after the dance no ones going home so everyone is going to hang out all night and I don't feel like being a 5th wheel. So from what my mom thinks, I'm not going. I'll just sit at home, eat some ben and jerrys and watch office space and maybe super troopers.
