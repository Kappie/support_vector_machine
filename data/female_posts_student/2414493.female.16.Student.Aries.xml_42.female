I have mock trial right before then and I keep telling myself that I can't afford to cram. But now I think of it, March 6 seems awfully far away...at least comfortably so.  One of the best Valentine's Days ever yesterday. Or perhaps it was just so damn good because it was actually living, actually being out with friends and laughing so hard your sides hurt, squirming as you get tickled from both sides. Shopping with A and C and W and D, and then just driving around for food until we arrived at Baja Fresh. Hanging out with A and C at A's house afterwards, getting 6 phone calls from a set of hyper-worried parents. Life gets better and better.  So yes, I am high on some miracle drug, and that miracle drug is life. I'm thankful that such things have improved for the better all of a sudden--I certainly wasn't expecting it. Yes, it's time I grew up; I'm tired of being 15 already.
