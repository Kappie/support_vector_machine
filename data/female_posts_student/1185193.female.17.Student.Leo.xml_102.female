Vacation has been completely wonderful!  I don't want to tell you too much because I plan to write a more detailed entry when I return this Saturday.  I have been writing muchos postcards to like anyone and everyone.  As long as I have your address, you can expect to receive one any day now.  I just shipped out the new batch from Duluth.  Duluth.  I can picture myself living here one day.  It is a quaint town nestled right on Lake Superior's shore.  There are many delicate shops and bustling restaurants to entertain oneself.  Plus, it has a sinous, beautiful trail outlining the lake's edge.  You can rent bikes (which we plan to do tomorrow) or simply walk it.  Our hotel here is wonderful.  Our hotel room is on the first floor.  It's mightiest quality is the large window and patio area only feet away from the lake.  It is sooooo relaxing!  I just read my book out there all afternoon and wrote postcards while sipping a water bottle.  In the actual room (well two rooms, if you want to get literal), there are 3 king size beds and a pull out couch.  The bathroom is fit for a queen, complete with those ever desirable mini shampoos, lotion, soaps, and conditioners.  Don't you love those?  Even in the cheapest motels they have them and I have a fetish for collecting them.  Hell, who wouldn't want something that was free?!  Plus, they're  Spa  brand.  How more luxurious can it get?  Anyways, this is our second to last stop before home.  We are here 3 nights, then drive back to Minneapolis/St. Paul (where we'll be visting the Mall of America!  Yahoo!)  Even though it is so irresitible here, I am pining to return home, blogging in front of my own computer, sleeping in my own bed, and driving my car.  I know this statement is overdone, but it's true, so I must say it--oh crap, it just slipped my mind.  You know the one about how it's always nice to come back home?  Riiiight.
