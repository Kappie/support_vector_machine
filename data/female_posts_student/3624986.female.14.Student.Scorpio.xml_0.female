He had bought the tickets the day before (or at least his mom did), and we had to sit in the theatre for half an hour before the movie actually started to get a seat.  I smuggled Swedish fish into the theatre and ate the whole bag by myself, because Ben had had dinner at Ryan's before the movie.  After the movie, Ben's dad took us to the mall, which was closed.  So we ended up going home.  Ben's dad took me home, with Ben saying, at every house, "It's this one!"  After I got home and had my ceremonial "How My Time Went" chat with my mom, I send Ben an e-mail and thanked him for the movie.  This was his reply: "Your welcome.  Oh, and guess what: you haven't driven me crazy. :)"
