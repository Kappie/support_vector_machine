Sitting next to me and Jess was one of our old teachers, and we wanted to get her phone number, but for some reason, we couldn't. We almost crashed on the bus, but instead of going on the road, it started going on the edge, near the river, almost in it. Finally, we stopped, and me and Jess were separated from my mum, and we went to this big shopping centre, and there was an escalator. What was weird was that it sort of...ended, at the end, with nowhere to go, and we had to jump off just before it ended so that we could go down in the lift to get back down to the bottom. It took us so many times to get it right. o__O; Then...something happened, and I tried to get Jess to find mum with me, but she wouldn't, and a lot of things happened, and Mary Kate and Ashley were in my dream (yes...weird, I know.); and then it ended, with a statue of George Bush (his hands in a peace sign, ya know...first finger and little finger up, others down); being burned down by a riot of people.  Weird, I know.  Anyway, yesterday, SOMEONE phoned (and I am not writing who, because my mum and Jess want to know, and I ain't telling them, they should keep their noses out of my business -grins- Maaaaaybe, I'll tell 'em later.); anyway, other than that, we went to the park yesterday with Troy, my dog, as well as going to get mine and Jess' half fare passes. The picture on this site, is actually the one I used for my half fare pass.  I am babysitting Brandon today, round about 4; whilst mum and Jess are going to the orthodontist, to get Jessica's bottom brace fitted. Apparently (according to Jess, who told Mum), they said it was her last chance, I wonder if her brushing has improved?
