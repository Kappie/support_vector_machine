We had such a good conversation... and we're thinking of driving up to Austin the weekend of her birthday to hit 6th street!  WAHOO!  I miss hanging out with Jamey... we used to do so much together.  I think it'll be much easier for she and I to spend time together once she's going to UTSA.  She's transferring there next Fall, so, we're ready to PAR-TAY!  I saw SI Mike the other day on campus... we made eye contact and smiled, but that was basically all we had time to do.  Maybe Tuesday he and I will catch up...  What else is happening..?  OH!  I cleaned my room very thoroughly for the first time since before finals.  ; )  I'm lazy... but at least my room is very spic and span now!  Freshly dusted and such.  Now I can hang up my moving picture!  I've had to leave it in the family room for such a long time... so I'm glad I can put it in it's permanent position in the house.  : )    An Unexpected Comment    The other day I was talking to Zack, and he said something that caught me off guard.  He made the comment that he thinks "we were married in a past life."  Okay... since I didn't know what the Hell to say to that, I laughed it off.  Yeah, I am beginning to think he's very "into" me... more so than I am him.  He makes comments all the time about visiting me in San Antonio.  Interesting concept, I guess.  I don't plan on anything... but you never know.  I live by the whole, "whatever happens, happens" stand point now.  So, if he should happen to visit... and we get along... and things progress... so be it.  If we are meant to be just friends, that's fine too.      That's all I have for today... I'll post more later.  :-)  I've got reading to do before this week... GREAT!       urlLink  postCount('25Jan2003');
