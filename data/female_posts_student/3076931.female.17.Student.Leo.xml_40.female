The shitty thing is that the boys are taking it out of hand. We were stopped on Parkside and we see Cody pull up behind us...Ian RUNS out of the car and pours sprite on my sunroof, thinking it would be open(luckily it wasn't) and then throws the can in the windows. GRRRRRRRRR. So our whole night consisted of WAR. this is full blown war, boys. watch your backs, or cars that is.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR I"M SO MAD!!!!! THE WAR IS JUST GETTING STARTED!
