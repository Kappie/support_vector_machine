Uneventful.   Tomorrow,  Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle ...HELL YES!!!  //stoked  Also, I have had the same unopened Pepsi on my desk for about two months now. I think I will actually drink it tonight.   In conclusion, I am a teh boring person right now. I will write again when my life becomes more eventful.
