It appears that everyone's AIM was dying today because everytime i was about to IM someone they would sign off randomly and then sign back on and off several times until they gave up and finally signed off for good.  It was annoying.  Stars won last night 4-3 over Columbus after having a 3 goal lead for quite awhile.  We're lucky we still won without having to go into overtime.  its weird but ever since Brittany left for Boston, Mike Modano (her fave player) and the Stars in general have been playing better.  She missed all of Mike's goals and greatness and she missed Clay Aiken perform on the tv at the Carolina game.  I swear if they start sucking again now that she's back, i am so blaming it on her.  LOL you know i love you Britty!!!  Anyways, today i played Bop It and watched the movies "Little Shop of Horrors", "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" (with the man with perfect cheek bones, Johnny Depp), and "Pirates of the Carribbean".  Me and Brittany had the funniest convo today as well:   ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: i love johnny depp too ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: he rocks LiverpoolFCis1: cheek bonnnneeeeeeesssss ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: lol LiverpoolFCis1: yeah so anyways ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: that's so funny tho...to fall in love with a person...all because of their facial structure ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: it's insane what america is coming to LiverpoolFCis1: lol LiverpoolFCis1: almost insane as falling in love with someone all because of their hair length and color eh? ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: haha ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: right what i was going for  We were both thinking of our boys.......for me, my Niko Kapanen and other people.....and for her, Clay Aiken and other people........LOL Britty, you know who i'm talking about for you and me!   Right so, Siru comes back from Finland in 5 days......and then i get my finnish gum!!!!!!!  yaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!  I'm not really sure how to spell it, but i think its called "Jiinke".  Ahh i have the last bag she gave me somewhere in my room.  Spearmint goodness all the way.  Tomorrow Britty, me and Jess are all going to a movie or something as a reunion party for Brittany's return from Boston.  its sure to be fun!  Now i'm going to go to bed because i'm tired and i have nothing else to write. Stars play today....or tomorrow.....whatever day this post is put under, on monday the Stars play Philladelphia (second in Eastern conference) and if we can beat them i'm pretty sure we'll go to number 3 in conference.  So pray that we beat them.  Happy Monday to all,  ~~~Taylor~~~
