Way to go, guys.       Ladies and gentelmen, I read a book. Yes, a novel. And it was quite good.  The Lovely Bones  by Alice Sebold. It took me less than a day to read it. It's pretty sad, but very good in the end.       Tomorrow I have to work 11-3, and then Sarah and I are going to Cape to the mall, being the little fashionistas we are.. hahaha. Going to check out the new Old Navy and all the other good stuff. I have a gift card for some free underwear at Victoria's Secret, and I do love free stuff, so we'll hit there too haha.       Then on Sunday, Dad and I leave for our "Southern College Campus Tour"... hm. This will be interesting - a week on the road with my dad. We're going to see Auburn University, University of Alabama, and Louisiana State University (of course) haha. We'll be back August 8th. So please be sure to call or text me to save me! Haha. The number's 573/258-0934. Lol. This will most likely be my last post until I get home unless I get internet access at a hotel somewhere... so don't miss me too much!! I'll miss you all.. love ya!
