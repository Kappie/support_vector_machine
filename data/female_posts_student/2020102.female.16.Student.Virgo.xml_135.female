C. Sproul  "Whence comes this idea that if what we are doing is fun, it can't be God's will? The God who made giraffes, a baby's fingernails, a puppy's tail, a crooknecked squash, the bobwhite's call, and a young girl's giggle, has a sense of humor. Make no mistake about that." -Catherine Marshall   "If God were small enough to be understood, He would not be big enough to be worshiped." -Evelyn Underhill    "With God, we make no deals. God sets all the terms; set them long ago with us in mind (while counting the potential hairs on our potential heads being formed even then within the womb of the universe). God said, 'This is the contract: I will die for you if you will let me.' Who could have imagined those terms?" -Lynne Hundley    "God's mercy with a sinner is only equalled and perhaps outmatched by His patience with the saints, with you and me." -Alan Redpath  "I believe there is nothing lovelier, deeper, more sympathetic, and more perfect than the Savior; there is in the world only one figure of absolute beauty: Christ." -Fyodor Dostoyevsky
