"someones thinking about you".. i wondered where she got that from.. and i asked her.. and she told me that when the nacklace hook is at the front of your neck.. it means that someone was thinking about you.. i thought about it for a while.. and as stupid as this may sound.. now.. i constantly check my necklace.. and when the hook is at the front.. i have this feeling of contentment.. it seems as if these made up things were made to make us happy.. like the tooth fairy.. and santa clause.. we know that they are fake.. yet belive in them just for our own contentment.. dont destroy the happiness.. believe in the fantasy things.. believe in old sayings.. i dont know if it will work for you.. but for me.. they give me a feeling of contentment and happiness..  _______ ______ _____ ____ ___ __ _  feeling 50-50 happy.. close enough to neutral.. listening to no matter what (boyzone).. currently wearing 14 bracelets.. thinking about "him".. cant wait until tonights night rally.. cant wait to see my youth group and my friends from last years hillsong conference..  _______ ______ _____ ____ ___ __ _  NOTICE: "passionate" night rally starts today..!! go jesus..!!
