So tonight, I am done with everything... and feeling great because I am on top of it, and the store looks wonderful.  I am closing alone and my manager has given me the access code and password for the alarm.  I get the store closed, set the alarm... walk outside and I can't get my key out of the friggin lock.  I know this is lame, I know how to get a key out of a door.  I think I was just nervous.  I walk back inside and the alarm is beeping really obnoxiously loud at me.  I punch my code in.  It doesn't work!  I punch it again.  It still doesn't work.  I do this like ten times in a row, before the alarm makes this horrible sirening sound that made my ears ring afterwards.  I decide that I am going to remain calm, but I can't.  I begin to cry.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know where anything is. The phone rings, and it's the alarm people.  I explain to them that it's my first night to close and the code my manager gave me wasn't working.  Nothing is working. Not even the "special code that I'm not supposed to have" that the nice guy gave me.  I accidentally call the owner of the store, before finding my manager's number in the pile of papers on the desk.  He says, "hang on, I'll be up there in a minute".  It didn't take him five.  His code works, but mine still doesn't.  I have to get a new one.  Bah.  Thank you Jason!  You're my hero!
