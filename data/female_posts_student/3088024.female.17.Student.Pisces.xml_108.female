ALOT!  I will miss a few people.  Miss Warren looked like she was going to cry when I left.  I love Miss Warren.  She is like a second mom to me.  She would be a crazy awesome mother.  She doesn't have any kids though so that stinks because I know she really wants one.  C'est la vie.  Comment.  now.
