I normally had it to myself and I could basically have whoever I wanted over and I could leave whenever I want. Now I'm back to having to answer Who? What? When? and Where?. It sucks. And I cant just invite random people over because my mom would interrogate them the whole time they are here. I dont know I miss my dad's and at the same time I'm happy I'm home. Grrr. Its so frustrating. Boo Frickity Who! I am fine being here. Its not like my parents are ever home at night, they leave at 3:30 and get home around 8:30 or 9:00 so I guess its kind of the same process. We'll have to see, I haven't even been here a full 24 hours so I will just have to give it time.    Well my mom is gone getting Dannylin right now and me being an idiot promised Danny I would play with her when she got home from school. That means I need to go and shower and get ready for an hour of hell with her. Wish me luck. And later I think I will go out. Maybe? I dont know for sure.   -gabby
