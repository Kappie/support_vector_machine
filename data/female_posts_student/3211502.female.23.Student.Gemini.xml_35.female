I talked to my mother today and we both decided that this allergy thing must have just recently popped up. In Cali and in Boston, I never really had this problem. But, sadly, in New York City, I'm suffering from allergies like no other. I've tried Claritin and it sort of works. But, I'm in desperate need of something more potent. So, tomorrow morning, as soon as I drag my ass out of bed, I'm going to head to student health and snag a prescription for Flonase!
