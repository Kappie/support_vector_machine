(just to let u know alex, i'm sorry bout that i should just get to know her b4 i say more stuff...if u told her that we talked bout her tell her i'm sorry and i'd like to get to know her) then once everyone else was off we just had fun not being able to type it was so funny. then we watched movies, it was almost 8 b4 we fell asleep. then that was my day. on friday, scott and aaron came over and hung out with us for a while. during that time lauryn threatened to castrate aaron with a butterknife. he didnt know what that ment so he asked, my mom told him and he was like nooooo please dont then he asked is there any way to castrate a gurl and my mom told him yea. then him and scott wanted to know what a "cl*t" was and she kinda in a way told them. then i brought down a book and showed them. it was soooooooo funny. scott started educating us on stuff about the girls and what they go through and might encounter. it was so funny. then my mom said something that scarred aaron and he went running outta my house lauryn was chasing him. then scott was flippin through the pages and found a picture of a penis (quiver) and laughed at it. i showed my mom what it looked like and she said that it looked like a broccoli. i ran outta that house so fast. then when i came back in my mom was laughing cuz scott had said 3 down 1 to go. omg it was so funny. then kt came over and we left and hung around. when we got over by central park aaron left cuz ppl were pissin him off. then we went over by my grandmas house and played hide-n-seek. we are so weird...good thing. then lauryn had to go home. after while we met back up with aaron and went over to katies house and hung out in the basement. there we just chilled. when everyone left, i went home to and ate yummy chicken. then katie came over at about 930 and we kinda in a sucky way played volleyball. then just did flips and crap. she went home and i got back online. then got off watched some movies till my mom fell asleep and got back on at like 1. there i talked to lauryn and alex. at that time he broke up with me.....:( i'm still kinda sad bout that but i'll get over it...hopefully. yea the i talked to lauryn bout it and she said...well she just felt bad for me after while i got off. then listened to blink182 and fell asleep. when i woke up i had to go to my grandmas for her birth day and i had a good time for a while the i wanted to leave and i kept trying to tell my mom that but she was like u got two feet and keys...walk. so i did i walked past the pool to see who was there and i ran into aaron kt and scott. they left with me and went to my house. from there me and kt went to get our bikes and and rode over to aarons house. we stayed there till 530 then went over to taco bell the over to lauryns then went to mohawk then lost kt and me and aaron and scott went over by sarahs then to blackhawk then they went to the jumps and i went home. 20 minutes after i got home kt finally came back over. she was spendin the night. then we were gonna go to central park and ran into aaron and scott again. they went to aarons house to get stuff and then we went back to my house and hung out, they stayed till 11. but during that time.......oh nevermind, i'll just say that there were some sad moments going on. then they left and we went in and played with legos and blah blah blah, then we finally went to bed. kt fell asleep first then i did. when we woke up i took a shower and got dressed...obviously. and then we watched bringing down the house..funny funny movie. then talked to christina on the phone. like at around 12 aaron and scott and christina came over and we all went to walgreens. then scott and aaron went to aarons house and me and kt took our stuff to my house and then christina went home. me and kt went to aarons house. and then we all left. kt went to her dads house and i stayed with aaron and scott. after while my dad came by and then i went with him to dinner and had a good time. then when i got home i called katie and i spent the night at her dads. when i got there i got to meet the new kittens....they are soooooooo soooo cute...my favortie is the orange one...cubby. shame alex dont even know his own cats names..lol!
