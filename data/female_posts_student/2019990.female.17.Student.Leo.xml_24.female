I dug through the silverware for almost a minute trying to find a spoon i could eat cereal will.  I found that to be really wierd.  Although not quite as wierd as having an unexplainable twitch.  Right Mahinda? You know, I don't think it's totally unreasonable to say that you can't go to school because it makes you twitch.  I would use that excuse if I was you next year hun.     I also just realized, even though my quiz is working, my links are not, because I don't know how to do them, so you'll all have ot hold in the anticipation until tomorrow.
