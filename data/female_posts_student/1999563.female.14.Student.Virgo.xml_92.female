I have never thought about what I am getting myself into. It makes me want to cry. So I have decided to blame it on Hana Sokpuva, my all time favorite model. I bet she weighs 100. She is gorgeous. Maybe if I loose weight I will be as pretty as her.  So, i went to the christian book store today and got a book on anorxia. Its a good book. It makes me sad that I ever considered this. I love myself. I think I am perfect. (look wise) Well..except for my crooked finger. Now i can never be a model. Well, now I am off to watch TBN.   Lay-tah  Laura   P.S. How does this sound for my new rap album? :P  comin' out the underground straight from the top while my beats drop never gonna stop ti'll my tapes pop, never lookin back never lettin go with the mad flow cuz you know i'm unleashed 'till the get go   I think it rocks.  Are rappers skinny?  I hope not. I don't think I can stand this any longer.  I am off to go eat fat-free yogurt.   Or maybe not.  I don't want to get fat.  Fat is bad.
