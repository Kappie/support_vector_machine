These errors could include giving a patient the wrong medication or the wrong dosage, amputating the wrong limb, or even leaving instruments inside a patient's body during surgery. Patients who are given the wrong medication could suffer adverse effects, which could potentially lead to death. There have been numerous cases in which physicians have amputated the wrong limb or leaving instruments behind. It is imperative that all instruments are accounted for upon completion of the surgery. I know if I was a patient and my physician made an error, I would prefer to know about it up front instead of experiencing complications and finding out about it later on. If the physician acknowledges his or her negligence, I would be less likely to file against him or her and the hospital. It is a physician's obiligation to be truthful with his or her patients. Because of the everyday pressures, it could be understood that physicians will make errors due to an error in judgment or simply because they were not paying attention. In addition, physicians are prone to make errors due to lack of sleep or other distractions that might impair their judgment.  Physicians have an ethical obligation to uphold by disclosing their medical errors.      If I were a physician, I would disclose to my patient if I made an error. I am the type of individual where the insignificant things weigh on my mind. Since I would be dealing with a person's life, I would have a great sense of guilt if my error lead to serious complication or even death. Patients may experience a loss of trust in the medical system and perhaps the physician(s) responsible. However, it will be even more serious if they discover that something was hidden from them, whether or not it was a minor mistake. I understand that physicians do not want to look incompetent by admitting they made an error, but it is much better to justify what occurred. Should the physician withhold information, he or she will have to defend his or her reason(s) for withholding this vital information to the patient and his or her family.
