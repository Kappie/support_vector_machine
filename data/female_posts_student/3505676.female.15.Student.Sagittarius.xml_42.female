We got some stuff for school [[gotta be prepared right?]] then we went out to lunch with Dan and Christine's mom! Yum...gotta love Carolina Ale House! It was really fun! As if watching sports on tons of tvs would ever NOT be fun + eating a veggie pizza...tasty! Made the way back to our house where we hung out for a bit. I called Sarah while Christine and Dan watched trashy shows on tv *hah* Is it a male or female? Then Dan left and we went to sell ads for yearbook! It was pretty fun, minus pants in the hot weather! Plus that one guy christine..TASTY! I'm guessing once i call them all back and everything we'll have sold 2 or 3 ads. Sounds pitiful but it's hard! *oh well* Christine left a little while and now i'm back home for the night...wait nvm! Going out in a little bit! Gotta go shower after thathot afternoon!   17 days til school.
