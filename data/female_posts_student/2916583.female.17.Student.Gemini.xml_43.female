Aah, that reminds me of the Simpsons episode where Bart and Lisa are in the same class, and the teacher's handing out papers, and she says something like, "Ashley, Dakota, Ashley, Ashley, Jacob, Dakota, Jacob, Ashley, Jacob, Dakota, oh, and Bart and Lisa."  I have a long list of names that I really like.  For example, I would like to name a girl Elyse (pronounced Elise) Renee.  I also like Lisetta James (cause when u think about it, James is really a unisex name...if Rachel Griffiths can name her baby Banjo, I can give my girl a middle name of James), Chloe Nicole (not Nichole, cause I've always hated that h in my name, pigheaded people say Nie-hole), Sophia Anne, Savannah Elizabeth, and Alexia Faith...my mom's name has its roots in Alexander, so I definitely want to name one of my girls some form of that, but I could not bear to burden one of my daughters with the name Sandra...maybe Sandrine Rose :).  As one can tell, I'm crossing my fingers for girls, but if I do get boys, I like Brendan James (especially if Brendan and Lisetta are twins), Ethan Cole, Brett Chase, Jackson Drew, Hunter Mason (and dare I say it for the backlash and teasing to edure till my 30th class reunion) Alex Scott.  I absolutely love the  name  Alexander, but I don't particularly care for the people I've met named Alex - shocker.  Other than the one I mention most, I don't like a boy Alex cause he talks too much to make himself look better, a girl Alex cause she's a spoiled brat, and another boy who's just annoying.  I do actually like two people named Alex - Alex B., cause she's one of the most interesting people I've ever met, and Alexa H. (ok so it's one letter off - same difference), cause she's really sweet and opinionated at the same time.  Actually, I hated the name Amanda until I met Amanda L., and I really didn't like Brittany until ninth grade...revenge of the Brittanys, in which I met both Brittany B. and Brittney B., and some other Brittany people at Bird.  Can you tell I'm procrastinating so I don't have to write my paper - which isn't too smart cause it's due first thing monday, and I have a lot more to go.  Well I'm going to have to end this one here, even though I have more to say, so I can finish this paper I've dragged out for two weeks.  Later.
