I hit 2 good hits, and walked once, got 2 people out, so it was pretty good. and troy was soo nice and came to watch me and i love him... robert linds and richard came and watched too, they're cool !  Hmm Tarah and Alex are going out now... its kinda weird because no more Skylar, right when i'm starting to like him, (as a friend). Hmm Well Tarah told me that Skylar made out with Maggie, and thats weird... so tarah just asked Maggie and maggie is a bitch and flipped out on her, which is gay. but oh well, some people are stupid... right tarah ?   Weeelll tomorrow is Canada Day and i think me and troy are goin to the fireworks if he gets home from hockey in time!... i hope he does czu the fireworks are cool, if not we'll just have a fire at his house...but hes being a big asshole right now so idont know. yeah he can b an asshole alot... especially right now.  neways this is disrupting my spades playing, so im out
