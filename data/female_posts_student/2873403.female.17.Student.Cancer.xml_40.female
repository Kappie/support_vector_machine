We hung about with Allie and Donnie and Matt and Elaine and such. It was good times.  Other news, Nick and I broke up temporarily, but we don't like to remember that. It was bad times.  I got a job!! I started working at Dairy Queen last week. I like it. Its fun. I just don't think I ever want to eat ice cream again though.  I think I'm dying, but I don't know. I may have to go get blood tests and junk to find out what's wrong with me. Ick.  I went to that show the other day. It was super. Did I just say super?.... No.....  Oh here's some huge news. I recently made amends with some very good friends of mine with whom I had what we'll call a "falling out", but it is all well and wonderful now. I love those crazy kids.  I don't know what else there is to tell. Not much else has happened lately. Oh well. Time to pretend to be doing research in Espanol.
