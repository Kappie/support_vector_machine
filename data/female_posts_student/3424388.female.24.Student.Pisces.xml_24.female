It has two U.S. cronies; one in San Fran and the other in Washington (D.C., I presume).   I haven't quite figured the site out yet. It's a little bit more off the cuff than simply a Wired-cum-CNet. Not quite the Drudge Report gone techy, either. The content, while perhaps not zealously fact-checked, is fresh and the titles are catchy and good for a laugh. For instance, take  urlLink "Blogging 'cruelty' allegations rock post-DNC calm"  and  urlLink "Yahoo! Offers! Local! Search!"  and  urlLink "The Merry Bloggers Set Out on 'Segway Across America' Trek."   Of course, some of the content is a little more than out there, such as the BOFH saga (Sidenote:  For fun looked up BOFH at  urlLink dictionary.com , which automatically fetched and served up the definition from  urlLink FOLDOC, the Free OnLine Dictionary of Computing ).
