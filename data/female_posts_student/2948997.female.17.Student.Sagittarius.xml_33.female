Honesty, I don't care if you all think that I'm superficial or a "fat cow" (thanks for that one).   Does your opinion really matter?  You all really do not know me, or understand me.  Make your snap judgements after you've spoken to me.  Or maybe I should feel justifed in making opinions about you...that means the entire bloody society. How do you think you would feel if everything you stood for was critized and made you feel like less of a person.   Please consider I am growing...learning  The person who was there is not the same as now  I'm SO sick of this western world, and make your comments because I'm sure the western world is sick of me too.  Make your hateful comments, make me feel like less of a person.  I have a flair for dramatics, but why change my personality?  I hate this, I hate the western world, I hate my cottage cheese thights, and I hate accepting people because of tolerance.  And, what...should I have an impasical third party? WAIT! We're like the middle east...we're all against each other.  Thank you very much, I will pratice my blissful ignorance and isolatism from the rest of you.   Long live the hermite!
