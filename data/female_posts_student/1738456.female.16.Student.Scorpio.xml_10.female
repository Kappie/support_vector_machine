I stared at the beauty around me, and took note of the hundreds of mirrors reflecting the coupled dancers around and around the room. Even with their faces masked hideously, they were devastatingly beautiful.  The doors swished shut behind me just as the music ended. The couples on the dance floor bowed and clapped graciously. I looked around shyly trying to find the musicians that had played such a heavenly tune, but they had hidden themselves well. So instead, I looked for the Prince.  I found his family at the head of the room. The royal family all had masks of gold, silver, or bronze, and none of them was unsightly. The Prince’s mother, the Queen, stood pompously behind him, next to his mouse of a father, the King. The Queen was thin and gorgeous. She had the makings of a beauty queen with a cascade of thick red curls piled on top of her head so you could barely see her crown. The King was taller, and just as thin. He looked as if he needed a good shampooing his hair was so thin, oily, and dark. What strange twist of fate that had brought these two together I couldn’t even imagine.   Their son, the Prince, had managed, however, to be quite dashing, but not too proud. He stood tall and firm ahead of his parents, and at the front of a long line of ladies vying for a dance with him. His skin was tan, and his body was toned, and he had a head full of dark shiny hair just long enough to brush across his brow. He bowed for every gentlewoman he met but he took none to dance.   I stared long and hard, knowing he wouldn’t turn to look at me. I was dead wrong. His piercing green eyes took me in for a long moment, and my heart stopped beating. He was even more entrancing than the man I had danced with in the field. He nodded, and then turned back to his line of ladies.  “A dance m’lady,” said a voice from behind me. I turned to stand toe to toe with one of the musicians. Only his head, hands, and feet were visible. I gaped at him not quite knowing what to say.  “She’s here to dance with the Prince friend,” another mocked as he joined him, “she’ll not even look at us.”  “Well I can’t see you!” I cried backing away from them.  “How will you dance m’lady? Will you have a waltz? or a foxtrot? or maybe a tango?” Said the first. The musicians played a different tune to match his words. Nobody in the room noticed, they just changed their steps to match the music.  I turned around hoping to escape the leering musicians, when another one stepped into my path.  “It’s just one dance, m’lady? Won’t you dance?” He smirked at me, and I realized they were surrounding me. Frightened of them all, I shrunk down onto my knees as they circled me like sharks.  “Why are you down here?” asked another voice, much kinder in my ear. I looked up. I was stunned when I realized it was the Prince kneeling next to me, and not another unwanted minstrel.  “The musicians, they were surrounding me, and they were…” I trailed off; his eyes were more dazzling up close. He hid his face with a silver mask engraved with Celtic designs, but you could still see most of his tan face. He looked around me confused.  “You can see them? Honestly, I’ve never met a courtier that could see them. You are very special. Oh, what I’d give to see them,” He turned too look back at me and then helped me up.  “Well I could see part of them, at least,” I looked around me, searching for any sign of them, even just their instruments. No part of them remained, except for the music, which changed to a soft melody as the lights around us dimmed.  “A dance?” He asked softly, and I saw a light blush cover his cheeks and chin. I grinned shyly. The music changed again, and he swept me into his world of colors.
