If I cut my hair If I changed my clothes If I lose some weight If I peirce my nose Would you even care? Would you notice me? Would you say anything? I see you at lunch You look at me But just walk right by I want to cry You didnt notice me If I dye my hair If I make my clothes Is it the way I talk? Or are you just my foe? I see you with that girl... Walking through the school Like you are so cool And you dont even care The tears, falling down my face The pain I cant erase Like Heaven's crying It's raining outside But you are filled with pride You wont....you wont sit by my side... If I did my hair If I changed my clothes If I talked like her If I peirced my nose... Would you notice me?
