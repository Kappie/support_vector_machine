I found out this morning my last exam doesn't start until 2 o'clock this afternoon which gives me plenty of time to watch DVDs, check my email, talk to my friends...oh, and study I suppose. This coming weekend, plus this coming holiday, is going to be pretty awesome -touches wood- beginning with today, the LAST DAY OF SCHOOL! I just got this completely hilarious email from Gaya, bagging the entire hell out of the IB. If anyone who hasn't got it wants it, email me and I'll forward it on. Last night I had BATS rehearsal -sly look- and I cut absolute sick at my brother and sister who wouldn't leave me and Adam alone. Bloody siblings, especially Bonnie who you think by now would appreciate that I would not like to associate brother/sister relationships with him. I have to go...computer admin is kicking me off. Later.  OK, I'm back now...and there is substantially less bouncing, but that's only because I got my marks back for some more of my exams -shudders-. Oh well, I didn't fail, so I'm not too worried. Just slightly disappointed. Yes, these holidays are going to be good. Tomorrow my family is going to the city for my sister's birthday, and I still haven't bought her anything 'cause I am so broke! Oh well, tomorrow I'll get her something. Then I have BATS, Saturday I have a driving lesson then BATS, Sunday I'll probably be trashed and then Wednesday I'm going to the movies with Adam. Awesome! Anyway, this time I'm really going. Bye!
