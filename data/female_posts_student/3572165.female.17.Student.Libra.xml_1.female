We took the bus up from Glasgow at 11:15 and arrived here at 3:30. we are staying in a hostel, which is kinda like a dorm - there are lots of rooms with bunkbeds, and you share them with other people. it is a lot nicer than i thought it would be, but then, i haven't seen the other 3 girls who are in our room :-P.  friday went...alright. there was trouble with the bank not transfering the money for the loan, so the Quigley's couldn't move in until today. Thankfully, the owners of their new home still let  us move stuff in on friday, so that all there is to do today is move mattresses, clothes, and other things that they needed over the weekend.  on saturday we went up to Stirling. once again, it was rainy and cold, but we still got to visit the Castle and the Wallace Monument. we went to the top of the monument, but i only stayed there for - half a minute, because it was sooo windy it felt like i would be blown off! the mission team had a free day, so Joe (from Broomall RPC) came to Stirling with us. Then we met the rest of the mission team, Rob and Jess Edgar and Rob's parents at the Caledonian Brewrey in Edinburgh for a Caley. A Caley is Scottish dancing. It was sooo much fun! i have never had more fun dancing than i did then. i didnt know any of the dances, and neither did anyone else that i was with, but we went through them quickly before picking up the speed, and it was really really neat. ten times better than dancing at prom :-P there was one dance where there is 2 couples, and they are in a circle guy-girl-guy-girl, and the guys lift the girls up and spin them around!! :-P it's called the basket. it was very very fun. too bad we don't have Caley's in Pittsburgh.  well, we are about to head out to Loch Ness to search for the monster :-P. Christie figures now is about the time for it to appear, and that she will be the one to spot it.
