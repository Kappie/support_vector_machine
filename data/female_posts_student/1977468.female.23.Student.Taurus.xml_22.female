It's pretty fun.   Prom was the uber strong-sauce. Lauren, you were simply a darling. You were the most happenin girl there I reckin, and everyone knew it. Thanks for being so spontanious, I know its against your INFJ!   My sister gave me a satchel today from europe. She just got back from italy. Satchels' are all the rage over there with the guys, here people call them purses. I'm going to try it out at the mall and see what kind've reactions I get... Although I can't decide what to put in it. Lip balm? Mints? maybe a small book? I really don't need anything off hand bad enough to carry it with me in my satchel.  I also dropped off my SG off today to get a custom bone nut installed, as well as a REAL SETUP, which it did not receive the first time around apparently. Well you get what you pay for. From there on I'll decide about replacing the pickups, if needed, and also about my Fernandes which is burning a hole in my soul. The guitar isn't my style at all, but it's still a fricken good guitar, im not sure how much money I wanna place into it cause I know I'd sell it to anyone who would be willing to buy it. Eventaully I'll have enough money to buy a more suitible alt guitar, either an es-135, a tele of somekind, or maybe if I wait long enough a Gretsch Sparkle Jet. Ooooooh that'd be tight.  I think im gunna start taking guitar more seriously, as in learning more scales and such, since I only know one. Eventaully it will improve my song writing im hoping. I've decided to make Queens of the Stone Age a musical influence on my writing. What they do is beyond words. They capture such odd feelings, and in a way thats just raw and colourful. It's true stoner rock.
