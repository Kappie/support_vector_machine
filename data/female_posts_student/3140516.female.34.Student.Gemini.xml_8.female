I have yet to meet the person that has that much control over my life that I refuse to talk to anyone else just because I am mad at them. Or, the other side of the coin, someone who assumes that even though you snarl at them, they insist that you HAVE to tell them all about what is wrong, because they want to help/listen. At least I have the decency to ASK first if they would like to talk before I get pushy, LOL! Look people, if I do not want to talk, and I tell you that, that does not mean that you need to start sending me a fuckload of emotes, with hugs and kisses and frowning faces or tears, or that you need to tell me, well, I am always here to listen if you need me. First off, to me, emotes are just like real signs of affection, friendship, etc. I do not hug and kiss every person that I know, just the ones that are special to me, and they know who they are. They are the ones I want to be sending hugs and kisses to, NOT the general public. Secondly, I find it supremely insulting when someone who only knows me as a name on a computer screen, who knows nothing at all about me IRL, starts to "cry" through emotes because I tell them I am upset. It's like mocking someone, or showing fake sympathy. STOP THAT! You don't care enough about me on a daily basis to find out anything about me irl, don't pretend that you care that I am upset. Thirdly, if I needed just   anyone   to listen to my problem or whatever it is that is upsetting me, I would go into chat and broadcast it in there. There is a reason I do not do that. Because only certain people need to know every little thing that is going on in my life, and those people are the ones I seek out to talk to. I swear, one of these days, I am gonna start autoigging everyone that does these things to me, so I don't have to deal with them anymore... Enough for now, I have some work I need to do on my website and on a few other things... TTYL
