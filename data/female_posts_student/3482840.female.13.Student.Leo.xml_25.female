Yeah well it was fun. We got to ride around in the Jeep w/ the top off. That's rare actually! It hasn't been warm enough yet. Ahhh... well. N2M 2 say... God my life is boring these days. Wait! I DO have something funny. Riding around all weekend w/ the top off the jeep, things kept flying out the windows. U can guess what they were from some clues.  1) It's hand-held, can be used with a TV or  radio , and is an aid to laziness. 2) It's round, smells good, and can be used in a  car  or in the house.  So can u guess what flew out the windows? I'll give you the answers when I have a few guesses. OK, talk 2 u all l8tr then. Byeness!
