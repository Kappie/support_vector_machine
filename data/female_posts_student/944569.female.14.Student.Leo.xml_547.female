I am extremely tired today and can barely see properly.  Everytime i blink, tears blur my vision.   The party starts, I dread.  The music begins, i am swallowed by sadness.  I look through the glass and see all those lights and bodies moving, i cry.  My eyes well up with tears faster than realization.  Fat drops of water roll down my cheeks as I bite my lip and hide.  Oh, it hurts.  Whenever the music plays, my heart throbs with pain.  Both yearning and dreading with a mingling scent of regret.
