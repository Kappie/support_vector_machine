My friend Mel is a wiz at html but I want to do this on my own...you know actually learn something during my summer break. I do have homework for AP English...but I'm avoiding it...for now at least. How fun is analyzing? Higher education has really sucked the fun outta reading.       Anywayz, my website isn't doing  too  badly. I mean it still needs major work but I'm thinking of new things to put on it. Maybe links to random fun stuff on the web. I already have a page filled with some of my favorite quizzes:     urlLink  http://www.geocities.com/moonlightenshi/quizpg.html      My friend Arvon sent me an im from the Phillippines, who when I asked which part of the Phillippines--he didn't know. Well that's nice. A  t least it's never a boring conversation with him. He has a strange liking to pain and suffering...I told him to keep his fantasies to himself. (pffft, like he'd listen).     Here's snippets of the IM:    ------------------------------     moonlightenshi87 (1:30:27 AM): NO don't do it    SinOfHearts (1:30:42 AM): what's that? u do!?wow i didn't know    moonlightenshi87 (1:31:12 AM): ::sigh:: now ur deaf too    SinOfHearts (1:31:21 AM): lol jk ...seriously, i can be perverted. wanna see!?    moonlightenshi87 (1:33:07 AM): no not really    SinOfHearts (1:33:17 AM): lol what!?

SinOfHearts (12:38:37 AM): lol yeah     ------------------------------    SinOfHearts (1:00:11 AM): damn...run me over!!!!    moonlightenshi87 (1:00:22 AM): lol, don't wish it!    SinOfHearts (1:00:37 AM): lol y not? then i can sue u and take all ur caaash!    moonlightenshi87 (1:01:26 AM): b/c it might happen, i doubt it will but do u really want to be squished under the tires of my car? it'll put u in a lot of pain and probably ICU    SinOfHearts (1:02:20 AM): lol, i'm curious but hey i can. i dun want it to happen either but if it does, i can know how it feels    ------------------------------      Well he's just hopeless -_-6     Anywayz, I'm needed to polish furniture...au revoir.
