I did find one girl in Holland who is 17 and has congenital glaucoma and 8% vision left, but nothing else.  (If any readers can recommend some to me, I'd be grateful to know of them!)   What makes us so afraid of blindness?  Sambo poses the question in his  urlLink blog  whether blindness or death would be preferable.  Happily he chose blindness.    I think we're all blind in some way.  We're blind to the people around us who need us.  We're blind to our own issues and our own faults.  We're blind to the obvious.  We're blind to future and sometimes we're blind to the past as well.     Likewise, blindness has a distinct way of making other things more visible to us.  The subtle inflections in another's voice.  The wind rustling the leaves in the tree.  An acuity of direction.  A visual disability doesn't mean the end of life.  While I don't think anybody would choose blindness over sight, there's a whole host of opportunities and new types of sight that can be gained if only we are open to them.   urlLink     urlLink     More to come...
