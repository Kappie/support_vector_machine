As of the current, I am listening to some online radio thing and it sounds like it's coming out of some cheesey studio...or not the studio, but some people just decided to get together and rent a radio session.  But anyhoo, they're playing, what I think is the stuff they wrote themselves about some real hilarity.  The song that was on was, "my countries flag is red, black and blue" and just had some horrible, HORRIBLE rhyme schemes that made me laugh.  I don't usually mind those songs, but it was just really funny.  I kind of wish I remembered some lines from it to write down, but alas...  But anyway kiddies...until next time...ta!
