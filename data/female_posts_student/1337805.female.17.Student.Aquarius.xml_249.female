I yelled at them and junk, told them to f off..Nick told me later I should call and apologize..but I know my family. We don't apologize. It's just not in our nature. I was expresseing how I felt about them stealing my report card, and not being impressed with the 97 I miraculously got. So.  This morning Mom came to have a "talk" with me...I was prepared for something WAY worse, like something she had recently found out about me or something, but it turns out she was rewarding Greg for his report card, and for equality's sake, my 97, and all the other fantstic grades I get, she's also rewarding me..so..HAH! It's cause she listened to how upset I was..that I worked so hard for good grades, and they don't even acknowlegde it. So Mom felt bad and is now giving me about $80 to spend on anything I want..The amound varies though, it depends on how much the car costs to fix. But yeah. So. I'm making a shopping list. She orinigally wanted me to blow it at Future Shop, but I asked if it could be blown somewhere else, simply because then I could get things that I actually need..like..hair dye :P And more pratical things than like, movies and more technology. Although, I do need some cable thingys to hook up my discman to my stereo...  So :) That pleases me superbly. I'm still ticked that Gramma's pouring $200 to fix Greg's $300 bike, but whatever. Auntie Donna bought me clothes for my birthday, and baked him cookeis for his. So I guess the world balances out.  Nick got me sick though, so I fell kinda gross-like. Went swimming in the ocean yesterday with Matt, Nicky, Sean and Nana..Tom and Karissa were too cool :P And then Nicky made Karissa, me and Nana dinner (spaghetti) and then Sean took Nana, Nicky and me to Durrance for some niiiiight swimming. Twas sweet. It was a lot of fun too. Found another really good place to go swimming at Durrance...just that the rocks are kinda sharp. Oh well.   Anyways, I want a shower. Hopefully that'll make me feel better. And I'll go beat the cat. that always makes me feel better :P Stupid bed hog....
