Ever noticed how we remember his offfield antics more than his onfield ones? Ever wondered why?    As part of this assesment I did a random sample survey of friends and family regarding the above questions and the answer is simple....what he does offfield is far more interesting than onfield.    Despite being known by Man Utd fans for some time before, it is his relationship with a Spice Girl that brought him to the world and the medias attention. In 1997 he met and fell for Posh Spice (Victoria Adams) and his life has never been the same. The Spice Girls were at the height of their success when they met and their future seemed certain to be a happy one. As a result of her pop star status his new girlfriend, and eventually his wife, introduced him to a world outside of the football field. But more importantly, all on his own, he set out to differenitate himself from the crowd and became recognised as the first meterosexual celebrity. (think sarong, nail polish, and all the hair cuts)    His transformation from talented footballer to sex symbol did not happen overnight. Early photos of himself and Victoria show that the man did not always have the style he is recoginised for now but it was the early 90s so we should be tolerant). His sending off during an Argentina game made him for a time the most hated man in England. It is believed that the first kidnapp attempt against his family was the catalyst for the media to back down. Since then Goldenballs can do no wrong (look at how Victoria was blamed for his alleged affair with Rebecca Loos).     An article about the Beckhams will always sell papers. It is this fact that means they are constantly followed by paparizzi where ever they go. Whilst this press attention has led to the huge endorsement contracts that the couple have received, it has also lead to the death and kidnap threats that have plagued their relationship. No other couple, since Prince Charles and the late Pricess Diana have held a nation (and the world's) attention so consistently for so long.     Becks is now known as one of the world's most beautiful men, the best dressed man in England, a loving husband and father and a talented footballer.     Will Posh and Becks always be remembered the way that they are now? It is up to the history books to decide how to represent this culturally significant couple, we will have to wait and see.
