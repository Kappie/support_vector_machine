Anyway, last night I slid down a bank and landed (literally) flat on my face, with 11 stone of Rob behind me. It hurt, and my nose is now an interesting new shape. Admittedly, all members of this blog apart from Carly already no this, They were all there cept for Vicky, who said she wished she had been, because she is very nasty. Very nasty indeed. Horrible.   Anyway, Bri-y's frisbee throwing abilities have increased supremely, even with her dislocated elbow, which I am sympathetic about, even if people like Vicky aren't, because she is nasty. Very nasty. Nasty as hell. And that's pretty nasty. Anyway, Jamie Culum tonight! Woooo! Yay! If I see you there Carly, I will buy you a drink, because I am nice.
