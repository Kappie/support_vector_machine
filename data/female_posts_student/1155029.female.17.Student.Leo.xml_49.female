I wish he had some conception of the way I feel about him, but its not something I can type out into neatly computer balanced single spaced text.   It would be easier, wouldn't it, if words came easier and I could say to him that he hasn't lost me?  That I'm right here.  But its amazing how with just a few words, a touch on the arm, a glance at the ground, and you can lose someone.  I could say  if you're going through Hell, keep going , because isn't that what I would tell him if I wasn't the one who put him there?  Yes, but that's not what's coming out of my lips now.  His fault?  No.  If there was a way I could say this and he would understand than I would say it in an instant.  Mitch? No.  What I said in that kennel, leaning against that locker, eyes to the floor.  What I said with my hand on his arm and my heart in my throat was nothing he would have changed by doing or not doing something differently.  It's impossible to sit here and breathe without wanting to call him and wanting to hear his voice on the other end to tell him that its not his fault, not his fault.  Not Mitch's Fault.  No one's but mine.  And for all the horror I've caused I feel like wrapping my arms around him and letting myself slip back.  But that would be worse for us both and I hope he can see it through the dark blue.
