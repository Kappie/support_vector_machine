But anyway, the point is that despite having the most eclectic mix I've ever seen (Violent Femmes, POD, New Found Glory, Papa Roach, The Cure) they through Jay-Z in the mix, which to be honest was my driving force for going in the first place.  And oh was it worth it.  He was amazing, he controlled the crowd.  It's unreal to see the entire field of RFK filled with back to back people doing whatever it is the person onstage tells them to do.  (We were up in the bleachers as I am entirely too old to be down in the crowd now.)  He ran the show, he was the reason so many people were there and since he wasn't even the second to last act, he was third to last, The Offspring and The Cure lost out on a large portion of the crowd.  Although there were 60,000 people there so I am sure SOMEONE stayed around to watch :)  I was wondering what songs he was going to pack into a thirty minute show and he managed to do bits and pieces of every popular song, interact with the crowd, and make every single fan out there happy.  I was so very impressed by him.  (Especially since he did Public Service Announcement - which I love).  So I could talk about the other bands because Cypress Hill, Violent Femmes, POD, Papa Roach, Jah Works... they were all good, they were all on their game, and even though I didn't stick around for Offspring and Cure I am pretty sure there is no way they could've given a better performance than Jay-Z.  I am told the only rival to his performance at HFS was Eminem a few years back... I wish I had been there for that one.
