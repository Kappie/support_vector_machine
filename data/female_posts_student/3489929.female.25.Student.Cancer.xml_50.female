I have to move to her desk now, so I can work the fax machine (which is only on her computer, and Jefe refuses to move it), since I am the only other person who knows how, and Posh won't move. So that puts me right next door to Crackhead.  Oh, joy. Oh, rapture.  In other news... I bought some of those Tylenol Cold Caplets, which are supposed to give you a "cold sensation" when you take them. I took some yesterday and again today. Got rid of my headache... did not give me a chill. So I'm bummed. But then again, I bought them on sale and I had a coupon, so it was no big loss.  Lisa- the neighbor dude who likes to run up your cell phone bill knocked on the door twice this weekend and once tonight. I don't answer the door, just so you know, in case he asks where the fuck you've been. :)  I think I'll start my diet next week. I'm already off the wagon. I had pizza for lunch. It was delish.   Bite me, Dr. Atkins. Take a big ole hunk of my fat ass.  (I feel a little guilty for cheating).  C'est la vie.
