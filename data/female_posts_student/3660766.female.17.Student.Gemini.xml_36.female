I miss his old hair lol Hes not gonna keep it in the mullet cut, which is ok with me lol hes getting it cut tomorrow, so whew! lol Ne ways right now im having mixed emotions about things. No one knows what im talking about, but i havent told n e one, bc its none of their business. lol Im thinking that maybe im holding on to the wrong things in my life. I need to focus on myself and stop thinking about things that happened in my life and just move on.
