Occasionally change is good, but in my experience it is mostly unpleasant.  When change occurs in my life, is all seems to happen at once.   Last Sunday I found out my favorite youth leader and closest "adult" friend was released, so she won't be working with us anymore.  this past week, all summer actually, I have been getting ready for band camp, the whole drumline has, and yet the line-up for the line is still not rocksolid. We have 2 people who are complete flakes, so even the line is changing.  A week from Friday one of the coolest families I know will be moving to Spokane. The Lewis's have been here since before my family moved here, more than 15 years ago. Margeaux, one of their daughters, is the sweetest, funniest, prettiest girl ever. She and I went through drivers ed together. Great times, great times.  The Sunday after band camp, and two days after Margeaux leaves, my boyfriend is leaving for college. This will be the hardest change to deal with. I love him so very much, and I am going to miss him even more. We have decided to try and stay together, and I truly hope it works out. We shall see.   These are a few of the changes that are about to happen. I do not even wish to touch upon the ones that have happened, and especially not the ones that are happening now, because those are the hardest to talk about.
