Shouldn't something insightful produce action rather than thought?  Just a *thought* that came to mind. Figured I should *act* upon it.  I had the strangest dream last night. However, I don't feel like posting it for the world to indulge in, so if you would like to ask me about it, I'll probably tell you.  K, nothing else to say. Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye crazies.
