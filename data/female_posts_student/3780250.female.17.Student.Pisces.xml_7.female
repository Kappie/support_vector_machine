I wach you speak, your lips the color of  pale, blushing roses.  I watch quietly; unnoticed; your  expressions, your poses.  I watch the wind dance softly through your  hair,  My hands long and yearn to dance tenderly  there.  I watch your hand absently graze your cheek.  Come to me, let me take you from your world  so bleak.  Let me share with you the beauty of a  sunrise,  Let me be privileged to see the heavens in  your eyes.  When you're ready, let me show you I adore you  so much.  Grant me the blessing to take in the scent  of your skin.  Permit me to show you where, and how, love  can begin.  I implore you, allow me to open to you my  heart, with trust;  Be gentle, in its fragileness; it may  crumble to dust.  Immerse me in the benevolence of your arms,  to be wrapped within,  And, when you're absolutely sure, allow me to  explore the continent of your skin.  I want to know you, and you to know me,  inside and out,  So there is no room left for doubt.  Let me show you the beauty of a soul,  Because to love you, is my most important  goal.  I Love you and I am sorry about last night.
