He knew her heart was in Idaho and so he agreed that sense she had given so much to him that he would retire there so that she could be happy. She talked to him the night before she came home telling him about the house and how perfect it was and that she signed the paperwork and that they could move in about 2 weeks. When she got home her ride said they needed to go right to her place because he had not been there to check on her dogs yet, he was suppost to go there from what I understood before my sister got home. When they walked through the door they found Bob my sister's husband dead. Most likely from natural causes. I mean there wasnt any talk of foul play. My poor sister is beside herself. For all her "trash talking" of Bob I know she loved him dearly. He did things that got on her nerves and she let me know it and did so in a way that unless one knew her you would think she didnt love him but I knew different. I'm not sure how much more of this death I can take. Now I am scared. it's happened to my sister(s) will it happen to me ? Who will go next ? Gods I hope that it was just a freak thing with Ricki and old age with Bob.    Nothing from AC yet. I'm not sure if I can deal with this. No this is not a cry for whatever when you read this sweetheart this is just me being melodramatic saying "oh woe is me" I will seek no one else out except you and I already said that until they show me the body I refuse to admit your gone. I will only be here for you no one else. I believe that someone if given a chance should grab love and hold on tightly. No we dont know where things are going with us, at this point in time. But I know enough that to me this is a great chance and I am not going to screw it up. My life can wait because to me I might have a chance at pure and total happiness and that chance is worth the sacrifice of a bit of time. We click so well in so many areas and I do not want to chance screwing things up at all. I'm tired of being hurt, I know your tired of being hurt and I think that if we click half as good as we think we might it will be worth the "fight" to work together to make a happy life. When I say "fight" I mean I know that things are not going to be all roses but that there might be times when things are bad and together we can survive as long as we fight together as a team.    Today I am going to go to Robin's new place to do a blessing. It will be nice to spend some time with her. I miss her alot we never get to spend time together. I wish that I was able to move into the same complex as she lives in now but I dont think that is going to happen. They have not called me back and I dont think that they will. I dont want to move to Parkland the other place that she found that has a good deal becuase it is to far away from where I am now. It is close to her work but I do not see her working there for much longer. I know that I will find a place. I just have to have some patience. Im going insane though. I found a perfect place but I am not able to get it money wise. I would be left with only about 30 dollars a month if that and I cant afford to do that. That would be after all bills were paid. That leaves nothing for clothes, food, misc things that are needed (ie. shampoo, tp, soap) but the place is so perfect. If childsupport was coming in then yes I could afford it. Oh well. I will have to settle for something else.     Well I need to go Robin will be here soon. Tony needs to get a haircut today and I think if I feel up to it I will teach him how to cook ribs. Ribs and rice sound real good for dinner tonight. I need to clean the kitchen (sigh) dont want to. Wish I had a dish washer other then myself. I just finished breakfast (of sorts) at noon Lol (well 5 til noon) and the more I see the house the more I want to scream. I dont know if this will ever get finished and done or if I even want to try. Well I should go.
