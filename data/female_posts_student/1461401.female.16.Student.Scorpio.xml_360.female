Tracy told me I was being quiet so she was going to leave me alone, and as I didn't protest (I am being quiet today, I don't know why, I just am) she assumed I'm mad at her or something! I didn't go see that movie with everyone the other day because I was in a horrible mood and knew I would just bring everyone down, so in return for thinking of my friends I get called a bitch! I don't appriciate constantly being wrong! And what about the people who put me in a such a bad mood, shouldn't they get some of the rap? No! Of course not. IT'S ALWAYS MY FAULT!!!   oh please, don't apologize, your words fall on dead ears and your sentiments on a dead heart
