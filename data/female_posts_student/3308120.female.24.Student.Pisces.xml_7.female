With all the wordly matters going on right now (soldiers and civilians dying in Irag, children starving, and the loss of natural resources just to name a few) both Bush and Kerry have addressed in their campaign speeches that they plan to expand high speed internet access to those who currently are denied this privelage.  To me, the speed of internet connection seems like it shoud be pretty low on the president's   to do   list.  However, they are both competing for the votes of American citizens, and if we demand faster internet connection, than by all means we should be granted it.  Remember, this is America...
