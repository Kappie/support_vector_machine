UGH! now... this is the 2nd major time my happy level has gone way down. the first was that one day....( my best friends know what im talking about... *cough cough* clint and megan and chris. )UGH! just another time that i wish i could go live far away from texas, or even houston like clint. it sucked not having him here for my sweet 16th birthday.., not having him here for his bday or christmas, and it'll really suck not having a senior year with him, but oh well. when you play "kitty" and you get dealt crappy cards, you give in and move on to the next game. but sometimes i really do wish i could move away. i'd go to cali and live with my family in sacramento or wherever they live by the water and go surfing to relieve my stress and just chill with my friends, or i'd go to new mexico and snowboard all day with my family and friends there. or maybe id just move away with mandi and go on that super  long road trip we've always talked about. idk but i MAJORLY need to get out of this place!!!!!!!!!
