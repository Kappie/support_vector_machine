Haiz... It is all worth it if my teeth is straight :~ 1yr and 4 MORE mths to go. Oh, I watched 'SHE SPIES' @ 8.30, it used to be 8pm, u noe? I can tell u, I enjoyed the show tremendously. I mean the ex- con girls can really use their brains, beauty and comedy altogether (like rojak) into 1 VERI good show! I am very impressed. Normally, girls kick ass (asses) would be like Charlie's Angels, THIS will be very fake... I really recommend this show, I always look forward to thur, although there is PE on this day   *pants*   Movies recommended by MI ! ! ! : X- men 2 Why? : What? U dare 2 ask such a que? X-men 2 is better than X-men. The story continues from the first movie. And the movie is packed with A LOT of action. Especially wolverine and Lady Deathstrike. *heart is beating* The movie also has a lot of comedy.  The part between Iceman's father and Wolverine in Iceman's house  (something like that) Father: What do u major in, Professor Logan? Wolverine: *very solemn*  Art. That part was very funny, of course there are others, but I forgot since I watched it on 30th April (VERY EARLY), the day it was first shown in S'pore. Boy, it was FULL house... And it's great that everybody is watching the same pic and @ the same time. *-*
