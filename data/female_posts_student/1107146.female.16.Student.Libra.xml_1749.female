Sorry about not coming tonight, Abby, but I was busy having the best day I've had in a while.  And Josh, sorry about not coming to MLK too, Mom said no, and I couldn't find you anyway, so... I didn't go, but I called your cell.  Anyway, best day in a while, yes.  Ok, so I went to my second favorite place in the whole wide world (first place being Abby's house, obviously.  Or on a cruise.  Definite Tie.)  Anyway, so second favorite place is the mall, another obvious one.  Mom surprises me with a makeover at the Clinique counter and $300 worth of makeup.  Wow.  Guess I should take that as a hint I guess, but whatever.  I'll wear makeup for a makeover anyday.  So if I look all spiffy tomorrow, you'll know why.   Then we went to look at stereo systems for my birthday.  Very nice.  I'm either getting a 5-disc changer Panasonic or 3-disc changer JVC.  I don't know.  Maybe something else just as nice.  Then we went out to eat at Chili's, where I had a lovely conversation with Rosie (by the way, don't let me forget to take you home tomorrow.  Meet me by the Campbell Center.)  And then I came home.  So I forgot my problems for a little while.  Oh, and I got Dr. Phil's new book about weight loss.  Turns out that for my height and bone structure, I'm the right weight. w00t.  Abby, you need to gain some weight fast.  Whit is gaining on you.  And Rosie and Liz, yall are obviously fine.  As for the guys, I have no idea.  I didn't look yall up.  Ok, so no word on Meggie.  Keep Praying.
