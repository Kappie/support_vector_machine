NO PEOPLE ARE HERE!  it's crazy.  creepy too.  i'm really really bored and i want food.  my food options here are somewhat limited though.  i have the choice of clif bars, luna bars, candy from the vending machines (the little ones, not the kind that sell food), and chalk.  all of them cost money.  i could eat coffee beans.  then i'd be fed and caffeinated!  my family is bringing me food later on.  much later on.  ugh.  so very beyond boredom.
