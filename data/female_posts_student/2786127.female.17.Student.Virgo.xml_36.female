I've already began to slowly stop doing homework...and usually come to school to sleep/talk to people/space out. It was so freaking hot in school today...if there were windows in any of my classrooms i would probably have been stareing longingly outside where its all sunny and happy and not a burning sauna.   Theres a powderpuff volleyball game this week for the junior guys and senior guys. Aparently i was gone the day they annonced if any varsity girls wanted to come help out...:( so now i can't coach and have to just watch. ooooOOOooo speaking of volleyball i was talking to makenzies old coach from last year at grassroots the other night, and he's heard rumor that Larkin might not play next year!! *excited dance* So now she can stop being a damn ass coaches pet and now i can rightfully claim the spot that is mine!! I'm so giddy! Next year will kick ass for volleyball because I'll be a senior (and because larkin and kelly will be gone) and theres open room to be a captain next year. But thats about the only good thing about next years season really...because we won't have a setter...and we all know how THAT works out *glares at Glen* *glares at BRVBC*. This season has been shit. Makenzie and Ashley talk about how they don't want to play next year...and i just don't get it. They never want to go to practice either, or go on tournaments...or basically play volleyball. My question I guess is then, why do you waste your time and money to play then, if you don't love it? Hell even with my shit team this club season i still love going to practices and going on tournaments because im playing the game i love. It just baffles me i guess that they've played it so long with me and they don't share the same passion.   hmm...speaking of makenzie, she was supposed to be at my house a half an hour ago. We were going to go get slurpees and then go crash the boys volleyball practice. She's probably with Todd...:P  So we talked about marriage in health today. I completely hate that class because its solely based on common sense...i dont learn anything new. We got a worksheet where we had to check weather or not a statement could be said to be "love" or "infatuation". bah. The entire class made me think about my past relationships with people. My teacher asked the class "what is being in love?" random people raised their hands and said things like "careing more about another person more then you care about yourself" and such, and then Ian next to me says " you can't explain love, you just know what it is when it happens. And I sat there and thought about it all that period and a bit into chemistry, I do know what love is. I've felt true love. I was truely in love with ben when i was 15. I would have done anything for him, and everytime i saw him my heart would skip a beat and my face would just light up with joy.Its not a feeling i can explain. It was wonderful and i had never been so happy. And then everything started going downhill, my mom was becoming worse and worse and my dad was on the brink of divorcing her, and then ben started acting funny. Not wanting to hang out with me, not calling me...and eventually he dumped me. I've never let myself be hurt like that again. Ever. I thnk it'll be forever too before i let myself fall in love. Certainly not while i'm in high school. But i want to be in love so bad right now...Lindsay was talking to me in the car on sunday about how shes in love with ryan and she talked about all these things...and i knew what she was talking about, all the feelings she was having. Its disheartening. But none of the guys in my life right now are good canidates for "being in love" with. I think out of them I can find myself falling in love with nate the most...but that would be a horrible mistake on my part because nate has alot of growing up to do for a 20 year old.   I've babbled enough, i need to go clean my room (yeah, i haven't done that yet. Or gotten together the stuff i need to do to answer matt yes for prom. Slacker! )
