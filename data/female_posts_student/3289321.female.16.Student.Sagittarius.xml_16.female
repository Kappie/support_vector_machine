It is going to be so awesome.  I just pray that we'll all be spiritually ready to go...and that we'll make a difference to someone.    Is it true today that when people pray We'll see dead men rise And the blind set free Yes it's true and I believe it I'm living for you  I'm gonna be a history maker in this land I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna run Into your arms, into your arms again Into your arms, into your arms again   Well it's true today that when people stand With the fire of God, and the truth in hand We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing We'll see broken hearts making history Yes it's true and I believe it We're living for you ^"History Maker" - Delirious  Later  >
