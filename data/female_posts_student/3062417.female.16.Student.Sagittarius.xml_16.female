Now all I need is a date and everything will be good. I have an idea of who I might ask but it's a secret. Everyone will find out soon though.   Tomorrow I might have to go to my dad's house. If not I'll probally be here being bored.  No Song Right Now Because I'm On My Mom's Part Of The Computer.  G'nite Everyone!
