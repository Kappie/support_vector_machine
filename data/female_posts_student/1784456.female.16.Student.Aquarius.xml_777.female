Mmm... well seeing as I couldn't really cope with ten minutes silence in geography a very long time! Oooh David ran around the field (400m) like 19 times! Geez he's waaaay to hyper. Hehe, we went mad today, for some reason these boys were galloping up and down the field and for an equally strange reason we joined them. Apart from Laura the depressed party pooper! Aww, some one *COUGH* was saying they thought Laura was depressed but I don't think she is, you gotta admit some bad stuff's been happening and we can't always be happy people! I hate that, you're either happy happy bouncy bouncy or you're depressed, their is no middle. Hmm... stop thinking? Hopefully some day I will, after that I'll do my homework! Ok so my cat wants to give me a hug. Bisi! I'll pick him up and trip down the stairs now... just incase you wanted to know that!
