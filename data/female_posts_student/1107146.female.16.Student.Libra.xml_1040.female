I got $20 and Whit got $20.  I think she's glad I'm sick now.  I also got this HUGE bag of skittles.  I mean, we're talking buttloads of skittles.  And I got these two cute little stuffed animal things.  They are SO soft.  I don't think my grandmother has quite gotten over the fact that I'm not three anymore, but hey, I don't mind.  I like the cute stuff in life.  Oh, speaking of gifts, Abby got me the most gorgeous necklace I believe I've ever seen.  We're going to go to the store she bought it at (which is in Franklin) when I get to feeling better.  She also brought me two yummy chocolate covered strawberries and one of those fizzy things to put in the bathtub.  It smells really good.  I don't think guys really get the whole bath thing, but you girls know what I'm talking about.  Ah, the joys of bathing.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going.  So anyway, I'll see yall later.
