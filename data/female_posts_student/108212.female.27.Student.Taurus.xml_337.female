Much thanks to Sheryll for helping to get Jhayne connected.    Anyway, I thought I'd let you guys know (if you have not visited the domain --  urlLink http://www.goldensushi.net  -- yet) that we offering FREE EMAIL (you@goldensushi.net) and FREE HOSTING (http://www.goldensushi.net/~you) to all Golden Sushi members. Let me know if any of you are interested. Since I've got paid hosting and quite a bit of space, I figured I should share the wealth. There's no room for greedy people here.    The bad news is, you have to have some knowledge of HTML and FTP in order to use the space because I don't have a web editor (learn to use Notepad, gosh-darn-it ! ) or a web upload utility available for you. If you want to learn or need help, do not hesitate to holler. My inbox is always open 24/7. If you don't want to FTP, but would like to create your own web pressence -- I highly recommend  Brinkster . They give you 30MB (that's a lot of space, I promise you). They have a user-friendly web interface that allows you to upload files through your browser. No online editing tool, though. As far as creating your pages, you are on your own. Sheryll can help or I can help -- if you've got any questions.    Other news, Brian has purchased his own domain also (http://www.virtualdumpster.com/ -- it's not up yet, but it will be in a week). He'll be offering FREE EMAIL also. As for HOSTING, I think he'd decided to charge for it. The pricing that he was thinking of was very reasonable, though. So it's not like he's going to be asking an arm and a left for it. We'll keep you up-to-date on that.    Yesterday was a lot of fun. We went to our first pre-marital counseling session. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It was kind of nice actually. We talked about how Brian and I met and our families etc. We took home this booklet and we completed it last night. We're going to go over our answers in next week's session. Some of our answers were different, but I still think that Brian and I are totally compatible. No quiz or survey or test will change my mind on that.    We went to see  The Time Machine  right after. I loved it !  I love Guy Pearce !  He is so awesome !  It's hard for me to get into all the details, but I really enjoyed the movie. I'm not usually into sci-fi because it's all so implausible -- I just find myself questioning everything throughout the movie.. This one was different, though. They really got me to buy it.. That, my friend, is quite an accomplishment. I love that everything happened in the span of a week. I love the simultaneous time overlay in the ending. It was great !     After that we went to meet mom at the bowling alley. I offered to watch Logan while she bowled so she could play without distractions. Brian was excited about playing with Logan, too. We don't get to see him very often. I guess that's all for now. Happy blogging !
