Let's ennebreate this a bit and say I have the worst luck of anyone in the entire world, and I have some people that can testify to that. And I'll publish the essay this weekend to celebrate my longest time without having a "woe fucking me" speech.   For now, I need to go record and stop my guts from fucking aching me to death.   Death, what a novel and wonderful idea.
