The thrill of an Olmypic event is one you can't find anywhere else. You can win all the gold in the world but none of it is worth as much as the Olympic gold medal. In 2000, Australia won the most medals  proportionate to its size and population . We rock the cazbar :D   My wish for this Olympics is for Australia to win more swimming gold than the USA. Either way, I'll be tuning in to each and every event broadcast here with an Australian in it - how I will track them all down, I'm not sure :P   Bring on the opening ceremony (but let it be not as spectacular as Sydney! ;))
