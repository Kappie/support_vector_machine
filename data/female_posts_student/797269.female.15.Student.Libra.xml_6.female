I've done a few things worth mentioning (don't get too worried about me, all of these were followed by long naps). Saturday I went and saw Grease at Melmark (the place I volunteer). It was unbelievable. They were adorable doing dances and lip singing to the sound track. I took a ton of pictures and I will try to post them. Saturday night we had a pre-show cast bonding party. We played some very serious, hard-core wink. No joke, I was AMAZING! I pinned Madi and Katie Dare to name just a few. I just had adrenaline running through me or something, it was out of control... I'm still limping a little bit!  Sunday night was Elspeth's graduation party (shh... the director's of my show believe Sunday night to have been a very important, unmissable, end of the year, required school event... I'm so mischievous!)   Today I visited GVMS. I spent probably a good hour with Dr. S and visited Miss Acring, Mr. Whitelock, Mrs. White, and many many others. I'm happy to report the school is holding up adequately without me. When I got home I watched the first two chapters of Angels in America on OnDemand... so good! If you don't have OnDemand, rent it! Everyone should see it.   Ah! Time for rehearsal already!
