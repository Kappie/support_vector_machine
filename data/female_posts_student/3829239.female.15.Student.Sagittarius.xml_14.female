And then a little girls pants fell off, it was so funny, but sad, for her. OMG! My mom drove on the highway today.....miracle! I couldn't believe it, I was like, "Mom, you're hardcore!" Ha, just kidding, but it was cool that she overcame her fear. After the recital Tia Lilia, Tia Meche, Grandma, my Mom and me went and ate at Tacos Los Valles. When I came home I had a message from Alek saying that he was back...so I called him. I talked to him, Jeanette, and Roy today, and that's it. Well Jeanette's friend Mark too, which lives across the street from her, but that was just to score some stuff :P.
