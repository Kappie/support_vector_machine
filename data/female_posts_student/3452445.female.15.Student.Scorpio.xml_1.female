(kerry served, and know what its like there, so he can sympathize with troops and GIVE THEM THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE)  there are jeeps out there in iraq armored by bullet proof vests glued onto the vehicle, since senor jorge isnt getting them money or proper equipment.  george jr. went into office for the soul purpose of finishing daddies legacy, and getting revenge on sadam for trying to kill daddy.  9/11 first thing he says "what chance is there that iraq had something to do with this?" OSAMA BIN LADEN thinks sadam shamed their religion by shaving his mustache okay, and thats only one reason why he hates him, they just coincidently hate the U.S. their not the only country! and we cant start war just on that. the weapons of mass destruction- IRAQ wouldnt do JACK SHIT against us cuz they know we would send one of our nooks over there and blow up the whole damn country. it was not our place, to liberate the country.  the surrounding countries~ they should be in there, they speak their language, they practice their religion ~ and were not talking about the radicals here ~ and they definetly wouldnt have the same problems as us- like the prison scandal- as said by jon stewart of "the daily news" on comedy central: "sadam's torture prisons aren't really shut down- just under new management"  i think its wonderful that the iraqi people are liberated- but excuse me- they hate us now, we are the enemy, and i would agree with them that we are the bad guys.  in the 'end of the world' web site thing, the u.s says something, that definetly fits now and that is "fuck, were dumbasses" we are in deep shit, and george is not gonna be able to get us out of it.     BACK TO 9/11 we shoulda taken care of the people that did and ARE plotting against us- they are our real threat, just because the president has people making sure that there is no way he can get hurt, doesnt mean we all do! and us innocent pedistrians are the one al quida is aiming at!!   make iraq safe, after we are safe from our biggest threat, who has proven they CAN and WILL do ne thing to hurt us.  and i know that osama isnt the only one running a terrorist network, but they have hit us, and hit us hard and they cant get away with that.  IM JUST RAMBLING NOW, ILL EDIT LATER WITH MORE INFORMATION AND BETTER PUT TOGETHER SENTENCES  in the mean time- VOTE KERRY!!
