Now all Nanhuarians can relax, and wait for the dreaded day when the results will rush back to us. Yuck.   Myself, I went to SzeTeng's house to watch The Park and I think I was reacting quite a little overboard. I mean, The Park was supposed to be a  scary  movie. I was crying at the last part. =$ Eek. It was really sad! The thought of having to shoot photographs of those you have caused the deaths of, and not being able to hug your own brother, and watching your mum die protecting you.. =) However, this doesn't happen in real life. So there. =P  I'll be watching Troy tomorrow. =) Had good reviews from friends who watched it, so I think it's pretty okay. I just hope I don't bawl over when people die in the film. Bah. =) I spent a few hours playing CM4 today... It was quite refreshing because I haven't been playing it since a few days before the midyears. I have now regained my freedom of play and  there's no need for me to do things sneakily anymore! Whee. Which means I have a few things on my list that I need to do:  Put up content on my website  Leo Piper: Forbidden - Design  Content  Help Cas do up her blog - i.e put the design up and stuff  I'd add on the list if there's anything I need to. =)  Mum wants me to sleep now. =) I want to sleep too, actually. HCL listening comprehension tomorrow. Why don't the CL people come too. It's too unfair. Speaking of papers, today's Lit was fairly easy. =) Mdm N. gave us the whole chunk of information for that particular question. I should've known it was what she set! But I think I'll pass this time round (After all, I  did  hand in my Anthology =) ) and well... Let's hope for the best!   It's 10.03pm and I'm still crapping. Old habits die hard, I suppose! =) I want to pamper myself but I know I must revise for the coming common tests and other exams. In Singapore lingo, yes, it's  kiasu  but logical, isn't it? The subjects that I'm taking aren't those that you can study overnight and score well in! Things like, er, physics, HCL, chemistry, literature, and especially history/SS. =) I want to study. I want to score well. I want to enter a prestigious JC (In my case, NJC =) ) and I want to become a teacher. I don't want a tiny slip in my results to cause trauma in my life!!!   You can ignore the paragraph up there because I was paranoid. =) But when am I not paranoid, I ask? I fret over the simplest of things. Besides doing that, I still worry incensively(Er?) over things I should not. =) I won't go in details, though. Be glad. Be very glad. Be glad that you are not one of the ( 2 3!) people I complain to. Ms Wong, Ms Leong and ST. =) Cool eh.   I updated RWAC. =)   urlLink What The World Needs Now  ! Click and read and review! Whee. I hope the people involved won't kill me =)  Alright, tata, I gotta sleep =)
