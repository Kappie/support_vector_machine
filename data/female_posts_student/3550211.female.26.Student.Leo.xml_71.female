Six puppies were killed, apparently by fireworks placed in their mouths, shortly after teenage boys were seen carrying Roman candles in a north Tulsa neighborhood.   An older dog, a 41/2-month-old black Labrador mix, suffered burns on her muzzle and hindquarters from apparently being used as a moving target for fireworks.   The Tulsa Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was caring for the injured dog and for the puppies’ mother, a 11/2-year-old black-and-tan heeler mix that was not harmed.   The injured dog had begun to eat and was expected to survive, said Laurie Myers, executive director of the Tulsa SPCA.   The SPCA believes the puppies died from fireworks that exploded in their mouths.   That is absolutely preposterous behavior. I have half a sense to call the PETA gang on their asses. They'll teach those kids a lesson, because I doubt their parents will do anything more then send them to therapy. My ass would have literally been beat to a pulp, if I pulled a stunt like that. Not that I could EVER do such a thing.  But, it's not just kids who do such  urlLink horrible  things to animals.   Police say the 9-1-1 call from Portland’s Marshall Park neighborhood Sunday afternoon sounded beyond belief: A guy driving a green Subaru Outback, dragging two bloodied and panting dogs down the street.   turned out to be true, police say.   Shortly after 5:30 p.m., officers found Sean A. MacComb standing next to his car in a driveway in the 10700 block of Southwest 11th Drive. Two cablelike leashes and dog collars covered with "a copious amount of blood" were still attached to the back bumper, police say.   The two adult dogs, a black Labrador-Rottweiler mix and a brown mastiff-shepherd mix, are expected to survive their injuries. They were being held at the Multnomah County animal shelter in Troutdale.   Seriously, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?
