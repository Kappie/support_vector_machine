I bought my pair of  urlLink Rohdes  (they look most like the last pair on that page) in 1994 at a specialty shoe store in Steeltown.    Since then, they have adorned my feet on countless journeys.  Closer to home, they have walked in many cities, towns and countryside between Peterborough and Sarnia, Ontario.  They have walked in the water of Lake Ontario, Lake Huron, Lake Erie and the Atlantic Ocean.  They walked in the Pacific Ocean off the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  Ten years ago, they walked over the grave of G.F. Handel in Westminster Abbey.  Shortly after that, they walked through the Tower of London where St. Thomas More and many others spent their last days.  They toured around the Coliseum, through the Vatican and St. Peter's, up the Eiffel Tower, through Innsbruck and Munich and Koeln and Lucerne and Firenze.  They rode in a gondola in Venice and on a canal boat in Amsterdam.  They trekked along the white sandy shores of Florida, overlooked the Canadian and American versions of Niagara Falls, and they returned to Europe in 2001.  They walked through the house of Richard Wagner, walked up Green Hill in the footsteps of so many famous individuals including G.B. Shaw, Robertson Davies and Adolf Hitler.  They stopped into the home of J.P. Richter and the home where Franz Liszt breathed his last.  They tread lightly on the sacred ground that is the birth home of Robert Schumann in Zwickau.  They paused with reverence at the Grabkapelle of Franz Liszt in the Stadtfriedhof and with amusement at the signs around Bavaria, in particular at Kronach, that indicated that "Goethe slept here __1__ night(s)."   With all of this history under their feet, so to speak, I hate to throw out these now wilting soles of history.  More to come...
