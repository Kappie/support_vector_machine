Just like a choclate milkshake..only very alcoholic! And delicious. Mmmm...gotta luv it. After the effects of the shots wore off we watched a few movies, one of them a very bad once called Fear. And we read magazines. Then we hyped up again, and shoved pillows down our pyjama tops and had sumo fights. Now that was fun. Jess's mum looked slightly perplexed at the humor in it. We ended up nodding off round 2:00am, not because we were tired, but because we thought we should and we were keeping Jess's parents up. We had a very rude wake-up call in the morning from Mel. All our phones rang at least once in a 10min interval. It was the worst wake-up call I've ever had. Mel was waaay too hypo on the phone that early in the morning! I mean, come on, it's 10:30!! We eventually dragged ourselves out of bed, and Jess and Ali made pancakes while Gemma and I sat at the window talking about girly things, including which guys are hot and which r not at church. Hehe, jsut a little inncent fun. I didn't eat brekkie, opting to play "Fur Elise" on the piano instead. (i dont like breakfast, or eating that much food in the day at all actually, mi hunger kicks in at night!) Then we hung around and talked 'till our parents picked us up, and I did a 1km erg! (4 those of you who don't know what an erg is, its a rowing mcahine thing, and jess has her own 1 in her room, at the small cost of $2000!!!!) I didn't even break a sweat, but that's prob. because I did it wrong! Haha I'm glad 2 get home now. In guitar deprival mode. I'm teaching miself "Innocent Eyes" bi Delta now. :) Blogging off, Beth
