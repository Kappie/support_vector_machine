Then she married this perfect guy and everything was just great.  Then, today he broke into there own house with his new girlfriend and was threatening Mia and he says he want a divorice.    When, I hear this I ran upstairs and just started to cry. Just when things were happier in her life..this happens. I love Mia.  Why do thigns like this happen to such a beautiful woman of God?  I don't understand.
