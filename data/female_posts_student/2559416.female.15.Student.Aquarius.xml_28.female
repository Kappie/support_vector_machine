I was stuck with a lot of work but when I heard the name of the dead person I couldn’t resist taking the case. It was a guy that had been my friend in high school I just needed to know what had happened.  I went to this house, was huge, I entered the room and I saw the body lying out there, I thought how could it be possible that a person could kill somebody that special. I started investigating and picking up evidence, in that moment I saw some papers and the phone miss placed, placed on a table that was beside the bed, they were all disorganized like if he trying to get the phone had disorganized them. I came up to the table and there was a name that caught my attention Jane Warrens, she was a girl that studied with us in high school, there was an address and a phone number. It made me think about why Stewart had this information, so I decided to investigate more deeply. This was because I knew that he had a crush on her since she knew her and the last time I talked to him he still thought about her. So I made my people check his phone bill; his accounts and thinks that could take me to some idea to start looking for a suspect. When I had all the results I noticed that the name Jane Warrens appeared in most of the phone calls he made. I decided to investigate her more deeply. I went to her house and in the moment she saw me she didn’t recognize me, but then when I presented my self she knew who I was. We started talking about how life was going for both of us and in between the chatting I told her about Stewart’s death. She seamed surprised and with the look of her face I started doubting about if she that was so sweet could kill somebody. Then I met her husband, Mathew, a tall and strong man. He was really kind to me and I didn’t waist my opportunity to ask him what he knew about this murder in this moment a saw his reaction, he was really nervous and he didn’t know what to answer. I started to suspect of him but I didn’t tell them anything. First I investigated Mathew’s life and see what he did for a living and how he spent his days for the last 2 months. In between months there was a week where he got out of work and he didn’t leave a message were he could be found, I started suspecting. I started comparing information about the two guys lives and about things that had happened through that time. I noticed something strange, in those two weeks that Mathew had left him office with out leaving a message; his wife had been receiving some messages and some roses from another guy. This made my suspects more accurate. Mathew had been spying on her husband since the first letter arrived and when he discovered that his wife was cheating on him he decided to kill him.  	One week went by and now I had all the evidence I needed to take Mathew to the police station to make him some questions. I went to their house and I asked Jane were he was. He wasn’t at home, she told me he was working and asked me what was wrong, I told her about the evidences I found and she freaked out but I couldn’t talk to her I had to get the guy as soon as possible. I went to his office and there he was, talking on the phone so calmed and sure of himself, but when I entered and he looked at me he freaked out and left the phone drop. I told him he had to accompany me to the police station that I had some questions for him. He said that he was mistaken that he had nothing to do with the murder but still I made him come with me.  	At the police station I told him what was wrong and why I had called him to ask him some questions. He felt so confused like if he didn’t know what I was talking about it made me doubt, but I still asked him all sort of questions. After a while of talking and asking question he told me the truth, the whole story. We went into my office so he could feel more comfortable, we sat down, and then he started talking.   	“Two months ago I was on a business trip, closing a really important deal for the company. I was away for two weeks and a half and when I came back I noticed that my wife was behaving really strange with me. At first I didn’t care I thought that she had a lot of stress on her because around that time she was organizing a family party that was really important. A week went by, the party was over and I still noticed that behavior. I started to suspect that something was wrong, she came late at night saying that she was with her sister or with a friend talking about further parties and events they were planning to do, but that became so often that I started to investigate. One night I went to her mom’s house and I saw that her sister was there, when before in that day she had told me that she was spending the day with her sister. It was strange but I thought that she could be with a friend, or that by that time she was going home and we didn’t cross over in the way. I returned home expecting to see her there but she wasn’t. 30 minutes later she entered and when she saw me in the couch waiting for her she started to act really nervous. I told her where she was and she told me she was with her sister. From there I knew something was wrong the next night I decided to follow her. She drove over to an apartment, I didn’t now from who it was, from all the friends that she had and that I knew no one lived there. I freaked out, but I said to my self not to panic that maybe she had a client for another party. I waited out side until she came out. When she left I decided to go up stairs and see who it was she was with. It was a guy I had never seen before, so I started to suspect that she was cheating on me. I didn’t ask her anything when I got home neither she asked me where I was.”  	This made me suspect even more about Mathew and I told him that if from what he was telling me he didn’t think I was going to suspect even more. He told me to listen to him. So I did. 	“The next day when I went out for the news paper I saw roses beside it. There was a letter saying “To my dearest and beautiful love, Hope you like them and see you soon, love, SK” I picked up the newspaper and the roses I didn’t mentioned anything at breakfast and neither did she. The next three day I followed her and she went always to the same place and every day I asked her where she was and every day she told me she was with somebody arranging things for some parties. The fourth day I followed her until the 5th floor where this guy lived I saw her kiss him as soon as he opened the door from there I suspected what was happening next. I felt betrayed, failed, I felt so bad I didn’t know what to do. I went down; I jumped in my car and drove away without course. The next day she was acting as she did before all sweet and beautiful as the day we got married, but from what I knew I was the one acting strange. I decided I was focusing more on my work and let her drown herself until she had to tell me the truth even though I was furious and wanted to kill the guy. For the following week and a half I dedicated my body and soul to work because there was a mayor problem with the deal I had make like a month before, so I had to go out and make some things to straighten things up and that’s why I didn’t left messages, because we didn’t want no body to know what was going on and it was a really huge deal that maybe the company could loose a lot of money. So we wanted to stay shut. I knew about the murder the day after it was committed and when I saw you come in to out home I was pretty nervous because two day before Stewart was killed Jane went out late at night with the roses that arrived that day, it seemed like if she was trying to free her self from it so I didn’t notice but well I had already notice a long time ago. The day the murder was committed was the last day the roses arrived. That night I went out with some of my colleagues to celebrate the success in closing up the deal and having solved all the problems we had. I was almost mid-night when I went home, when I was parking my car, Jane’s car stationed beside. I suspected that she had gone to see him; I was so furious that I got in my car and told her I had forgotten something at the office that was really important. I got into the car and drove to this guy’s apartment I was really mad, I went to talk to him I knocked on the door but there was no answer. I knocked several times and then decided to through the door down. When I opened the door I found him lying on the floor with blood all over the place, I touched his neck to see if he had a pulse but he was gone. So that was when I called the police and reported the murder, and that’s the whole story” 	I was shocked on what I just have heard. How could I have been so blind not suspecting of her first. She trying to incriminate her husband saying that he came in late without saying where he was and all sorts of actions that he was supposedly doing but the truth was that she was the one doing them. In that precise moment I stepped out of the office and went for and order to arrest this woman.  	We went to her house and told her to come with us she was resisting and saying she had nothing to do with what had happened. But still forced we made her accompany us.  	Right back at the police station we placed her in a room to ask her some questions. She didn’t want to answer and we couldn’t obligate her to talk. So I decide to look for another method. I asked Mathew to talk to her and he accepted. He entered the room and as soon she saw him she felt so guilty for making him go through what he had gone that she confessed everything. She murdered Stewart Kent. The roses were all fake, she sent them herself to make it seem like if it was a guy that was obsessed with her, and that she was having an affair. She made this be so obvious to his husband so he noticed that she was having an affair and he went to kill the guy for stilling his wife. In the end she saw that her husband didn’t care so she decided to murder him herself but leaving evidence that seemed as if her husband had killed him. She also said that the affair never happened that the made it up just because she was angry with him because he didn’t close a huge deal for a party from where she could get a great amount of money she could use to pay a debt that she had. 	We let Mathew out; he had his face red and his eyes full of tears. He was so sad. We told him that everything was going to be o.k now that she had confessed. He asked me what was going to happen to her and I told him that because she had accepted the crime and claimed herself guilty maybe the judge could conceder the penalty. He thanked me about everything. I walked him to the door and shake his had. Again he said thank you  and with his soul in deep pain and tears running down his face I saw him walk away and jump into his car and drive away.
