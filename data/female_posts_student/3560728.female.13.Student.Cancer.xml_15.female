The drive is really long and tiring and you pass through what seems like hundreds of towns that are falling apart. The last of these being a town called Clinton. Big Bar Lake is 45 minutes away from this town, and can be reached by driving along this brutal gravel road. There's a point in the road where you can finally see the lake, and it looks really cool. The water is actually several colours depending on the it's depth. There's the indigo part, the turquoise part, and the teal part. There's a marshy portion which is the closest part when you look at it from this little view point in the road. Anywho, as you continue along the road you pass this old, abbandoned ranch, that actually has foot long grass sprouting out of it's roof. It's very creatively stimulating to go there alone, and I probably will later this visit. After this you reach my family's cabin-y thing, which actually looks really strange from outside, but In other news, my birthday's coming up! Yay! I'm hoping for a lot of CD's. :D Hee hee! OOh, dinner's ready so I'll be saying goodbye for a bit!
