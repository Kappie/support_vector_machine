While Comcast has been trying to make back the profits it lost with the failed Disney merger, the Bells have teemed up with satellite providers to offer television services along with their telephone and broadband lines. Companies like Verizon and SBC, that own mobile carries, can offer wireless services and bundle plans. Comcast says its planning to introduce Internet phone services to compete with the Bells, but that isn't to be implemented until next year.  Comcast may have gained 1.1 million new digital customers in the last quarter, but they have also succeded in loosing 10.4% of its phone service suscribers and 96,000+ basic cable suscribers.
