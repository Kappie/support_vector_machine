DIE DIE DIE!!!!!! Like i SHOULD HAVE SAID, i noticed you guys were saying how this blog is boring and empty.  THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT HERE!!! Okay, going to do this in point form of what i was going to say before BLOGGER THE IDIOTIC AND CRAPPY SERVICE WEBSITE delted what i was going to say:  -been watching lots of anime, working on my story and ogling at F4 -Miss the internet...i wanna go on the blog and see the new Naruto releases!!!:'( -I love prince of tennis!  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT -Tzai Tzai's sooooo shuai!!!  *siiiigh* -i cant fit in all my stuff into one bag for EDPHY -why are u happy about someone stealing ur car?  I was robbed once when i was 5.  The bastard took my music box, ring and pearl earrigns my mom passed on to me ( you're lucky i shortened this,  Before i put a long and descriptively gorya nd violent scen of what i would do to this guy but i'll shorten it.  I'll snap all his bones, twist his limbs and dislocate them.  I will cut open his hands and legs and fill them with rubbing alcohol and salt.  i will stuff his mouth with spiders and make him starve by putting a tantalizing meal in front of him that just a LITTLE bit out of reach.  To finish, i will kick him in the ouch area until he keels over in pain, bleeds from his mouth and kisses the moon.) -My comp wont be fixed for quite a while. - My mom called our school stupid and idiotic for making us wear first dress to EDPHY,  I will not quote as i did before for it is too long.
