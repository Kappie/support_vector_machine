It was also good to see my little cousins... except... last night I woke up at 3:30am with a HORRIBLE stomach ache, and ran to the bathroom to vomit for about 1 1/2 hours.  : (  I'm somewhat certain I picked it up from my cousins, because they were sick last week with this stomach virus.  But, if I didn't get it from them, I most likely got it from someone at school, because there's a stomach virus going around.  Ain't life grand?  Anyhow, I'm feeling better now... except I'm really hungry, because there's nothing in my stomach.  At the same time I'm terrified to eat anything, because I don't want to get sick again.  Anyhow... that's all I feel up to writing now... I'm pretty weak... sickness does that to you.  I will post something later in the week... provided I don't get sick.  I only hope I feel well enough to practice for my quiz and proficiency exam.  And I have to come up with a research topic by Friday for my World Lit class.  How the HELL am I supposed to pick a topic (in a VERY broad time span, by the way) for a term paper that could make or break me only one month into the semester?!  This professor is out of her MIND.  It's the only time I have SERIOUSLY felt someone should NOT be a professor!  She's stupid... it takes her forever to say a sentence... and she repeats the same idea in a different way... she can do that for like, 10 minutes... and she can find about 20 ways to say, "My cat is crazy."  :(  I hate that class...!  WITH A PASSION!!!!       urlLink  postCount('10Feb2003');
