I felt that it was pretty good and I wanted to share it with whomever happened to read this thing I created. Here it is:    Watching Through Windows       I am watching through these windows and wondering why they are here,     Wondering if you can see the true me from the other side.      I see many people passing by,     They stare at me as if I am the different one,     When all of them have secrets of their own.      I am a wife, a sister, and a daughter,     I have friends from many walks of life,     I am overweight and scared to be alone.     I am a Aunt and someone cousin,     Most of my friends are gay,     Yet I don’t see that, because they are my friends.      I love my Family.     My Friends are also my family.      I watch through these windows and I see my neighbor,     He is usually quite, but I know he drinks a lot.     He probably has many demons,     I see a girl a crossed the street,     Waiting, waiting, waiting… but for whom?      I hear the voices of men, these men I never see but always hear.     Their voices come from a cross the street, I wonder if they ever work     It seems as if they are always sitting out there,     Hiding in the shadows.      I see homeless men walk to the corner store and return     With a bottle in a paper bag,     I wonder why they do this to themselves,     Why?      I wonder if all of the things I see are true to the people I see on the other side of the window,     And if so I wonder what they think of me?
