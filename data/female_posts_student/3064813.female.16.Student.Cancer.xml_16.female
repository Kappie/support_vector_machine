I decided that I was going to be CONSTANTLY and OBSESSIVELY in the know about Weezer.  With this decided I trekked off to google to google "weezer news" and let someone else to the lookup work for me.  At any rate, the page popped up (like it usually tends to do) and THERE IT WAS!  The most AMAZING thing EVER!  Hailed as NOT a side project but separate musical entity APART from Weezer was the band... THE SPACE TWINS!  YES!  THE SPACE TWINS! After I was done hyperventilating, I checked it out.  Seeing as I'm on a school computer, I am sadly without speakers and could not, therefore, enjoy the forty second clips they had.  Sad and alone, I meandered over to the Tour Diary thing and was SHOCKED at the witty accounts of the humorous ventures of the poor bandmembers in TEXAS!  THEY'RE IN TEXAS!  Sadly, they are not enjoying my home state.  I'd bake them cookies to try to make up for it or something, but A: they would sit on my counter until my sister ate them because B: how the HELL would I get them cookies? Anyways, I emailed them (they're going to hate me because I've fallen in love with them before actually listening to their music), and I EAGERLY await a response!  I sincerely doubt that I'll get one, although I DID hear back from the two other bands that I pestered.  In all seriousness, there is no better thing than getting an email from an exalted bandmember.  Sheesh.  Well, anyways, the bell is about to ring, so YOU'VE BEEN SAVED!  By the bell, I mean. Oh, wait!  QUICK NEWS!  Texans are a bad influence on me.  I skipped for the first time today.  NOOOOO!!!  Not that!  Hope my parents never read this.
