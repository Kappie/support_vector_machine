Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and the obligatory nervous nelly sidekick are trying to escape from a mansion full of vampires when the friar/scientist/tonto/whatever asks how.  “Through that window” our hero and heroine say simultaneously before smashing through a stained glass window.  For that brief moment  Van Helsing  is giddy with it’s own adventure but once they touch down the film returns to resembling a bird trying to carry a 50lb. safe.    Not being a fan of  The Mummy , the film did have a certain campiness I appreciated.  Essentially a homage to the Saturday afternoon matinees Sommers grew up on,  The Mummy  never relented its sense of fun, but it seems a raised budget and higher expectations killed any joy Sommers had to put into  Van Helsing .  Lacking  The Mummy ’s light, breezy touch,  Van Helsing  hits the ground running with its action scenes and never stops, but that’s the problem.  Non-stop action leaves the film with no character development or pacing.  Jackman is a charismatic performer who swaggers around Transylvania with a roguish gleam in his eye that could have been better put to use in another movie.  His character can’t remember his past but Jackman’s having too much fun playing the hero to care.  Kate Beckinsale for some reason has caught Hollywood’s attention (I don’t know why Minnie Driver, a sparkling, pretty Brit with greater range, doesn’t get the push) but she’s too dour and serious for this film.  A good dose of Keira Knightley pluck, ala  Pirates of the Caribbean , would have done wonders for  Van Helsing .  Sommers use of CGI went on ad nauseum, as if he was using it because he had it to use.  The appropriate use of CGI seems to be a line directors are struggling to find (a worthy topic for ‘Up For Discussion’ perhaps?) and in the case of  Van Helsing  the old truth, less is more applies.  Maybe next time Sommers can shave a little bit off his budget, put a leash on his CGI and give us more of what we really want-fun.
