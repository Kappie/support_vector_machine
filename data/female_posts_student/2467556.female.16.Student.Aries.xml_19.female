I have to keep on telling myself i can do this.  *tear* i didn't see everyone i usualy see today because there's a freaking flu epidemic going around and people are dropping like flies.  Its almost like the black plague except.....not.  Yeah so anyways, today was boring like most other days except for thursdays because thats hockey night for coppell and ESPN/NHL.  I went to French Club today because my mom wants me to get "involved" so i can go to college.  It turns out that all we do is eat french cookies for 30 mins with all our buddies and talk.  Totally works for me.  Hmmm Roberta gave me a hard time about the freaking Stars losing to the freaking Ducks.....i decided to enlighten her on how Dallas snapped NJ's 13-game winning streak....I still love you Ro!  Oh yes and me, Ro, and Britt decided today that we're going to work for Nokia....or at least i am.  They get all these great holidays, benefits and AWESOME cell phones according to my research.  Yeah so we have assessed that if we move to Finland to work for Nokia we will have perfect bodies, perfect hair, perfect skin and perfect cell phone plans for the rest of our lives.  Does anyone realize that 9:30 hockey games really are VERY late.....i'm always really tired when i get home from one.  oh well, gotta represent (lol sarah).  Mr. Dutton has also decided that i am going to grow up, marry a hockey player and be the only wife in their special team press box suite that is yelling/cussing at the players including my husband to do better.  Oh yeah, which reminds me, the Dallas Stars as of monday are going on some 2 day team bonding trip thing with wives included......i hope the wives lay down the law saying "alright look boys, either you start winning games or you don't get any until you do. and you won't get anything good until you win the stanley cup either".   Thats what i would do and i think Brittany (@Chili's) last night said she would do too.  Hey, you gotta get them going somehow and if taking away privileges (lol) is the only way to do it, then oh well.  Which also reminds me, my Daddy is getting me the NHL Center Ice TV Package thing in which you can watch ALL the games in the NHL!!!!!!  1000 games a week is what the ad said!!!!  I told him i NEEDED to see a winning team due to the Stars recent....um....problems.  He said he understood and he'd think about it which pretty much means its....a....CHRISTMAS PRESENT!!!  yaaaaaaay!  Alright, hw calls and i need to sleep tonight!   F cubed (lol jess and brit), JHAA Member since....um....i can't remember (lol brit), Niko Rocks!,  ~~~Taylor~~~
