Hopefully I get a good grade for it, or at least an 80. If I don't, it won't make my grade drop too badly, because I had a 99 in there last nine weeks.  Second block we had an open book test. It was easy. Then me and Melanie discussed the times and such for Persacon!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait.  Third block.....I love Mr. Lewter! He's so awesome. I just wish that everyone respected him more. He's a good teacher, but nobody knows that cuz they never listen. Me and Chris Jones finished our work today and talked about DDR. He said he was going to play on my dance pad in the nude......scary images, I tell you. *sniffles* I'm gonna need therapy from that statement too....... ah well!  TOMMORROW IS ANIME CONVENTION!!!!! I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight, I'm so excited! It's going to be sooooooo much fun, and the best part about it is that I'm going to get to spend the WHOLE day with Nick!!!! or at least, I hope I am! His parents better not schedule out his day for him!! I'll be angry. Hehe, maybe I'll just come over there and kidnap him. That'd be funny, but I think that I'd probly get in trouble with his parents if I did that. I'm really bored right now, so that's probly why I'm still writing in this blog. Blogging always helps me eliminate boredom. Nick made me a Cake CD the other day, and I've listened to it 6 times already. I think I'll have some of the songs memorized before long. lol. hmm.......what else to write about. Chelsea writes EXTREMELY long blogs, in case anyone HASN'T noticed. lol, no offense Chelsea, cuz I like reading your blogs. and Nick! he doesn't write enough in his, by comparison. gonna have to beat him up, I tell you. Have you ever noticed that in the song "When you Wish Upon a Star" that Jiminy Cricket has a big range in his voice. I just listened to the song, and I don't have a range like that. My voice doesn't go that high!! lol.  Wow, my blog is getting conspicuously longer.....better stop, or I might beat Chelsea's longest blog...(though not likely) Love, Shannon "Don't ya wanna know why we keep starting fires?
