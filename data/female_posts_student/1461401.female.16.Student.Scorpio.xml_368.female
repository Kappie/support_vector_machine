One last dance in this parking lot. Oh yeah I, I got a heart of darkness." Heart Of Darkness by Sparklehorse has been on my mind lately. It's funny how some princes ride up on while stallions, while some stand in a Big Boys parking lot while you drive away. I don't know. I'm rambling on now. Mom told me to go to bed, but I just don't think it will do me any good. I don't want to go back to sleep. I feel backwards. I feel like any time I try to do something right, it always ends up for the worse. I always end up making someone mad without even realizing it until it's too late. I'm sorry tracy. I'm sorry alex. I'm sorry mark and amanda and kevin and ben and amber and matt and rob and ian.   fireworks are so beautiful. even though their beauty is short lived, they always go out with a bang.
