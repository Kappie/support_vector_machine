The old man whispered, "Yes, one last wish. I smell something familiar and delicious. It smells like your mother's apple strudel. Bring me a piece of your mother's strudel. There is none better."   The son was gone to the kitchen longer than expected. When he returned empty handed, the dying father asked, "What took you so long? And why no apple strudel?"   The son looked with a sad face and said, "Papa, you know how mama is. Always so practical and so strict. She says the strudel is for after the funeral."
