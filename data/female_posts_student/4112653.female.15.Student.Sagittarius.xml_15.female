The night was coming to an end as the sun peeped up from the clouds. Tittanya was roused by the rooster crow.   "Damien, what did I do?" she sighed, crompling to the ground. A glistening tear slid down her pale cheek.   The sight of a long lost friend had invoked so many memeories. It was all bittersweet. He had died to save her life, but he had not realised at the time that she couldn't live without him.   Drying her eyes, she felt her own being warming. It was as if she had been frozen, unfeeling, for so long. Too long.   Again, Tittanya fingered the crystal. There was no doubt that Damien had wanted to help her in her battle against Marion. And she had been given the green stone.   "Why?" she wondered. "How will this thing save me?"   Suddenly, Tittanya felt a burning need to see Damien again. She had been stupid to turn him away and think that she could handle this on her own. What would he be doing right now, thinking right now?      A cold hand rested on Tittanya's shoulder, and her blood froze to icicles.
