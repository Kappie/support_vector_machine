I laughed through the whole thing. Man, it delivered. I mean right from the beginning with the guy struggling with the fishing pole, you just knew you were in for a good movie. And then that one scene randomly at one of the times when the movie SHOULD have ended but continued to not end, when everyone is laughing. That was disturbing and yet at the same time hilarious in an amateur porn kind of way.
