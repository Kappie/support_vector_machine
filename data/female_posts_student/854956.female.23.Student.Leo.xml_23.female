The Dr. suggested that the pressure from jumping around and running and stuff (playing soccer AGAIN!) is making the rod cause pressure to his knee.  Anyway, he should be fine.  He said it's a bit tight, but I totally relate to that.  That's how my knee gets all the time when the weather changes, and such.  Sometimes I wish I hadn't had the knee surgery, but I guess I probably would've gotten worse had they not poked holes in that bone to get blood flow.  Damn softening bones!  I'm 21!  I shouldn't have arthritis... it makes me sad sometimes.  Oh, well.  Moving on, this Sunday my Mom and I are ushering at church for the Thank Offering Sunday (where women usher and basically do ALL of the stuff for the service).  Jamey will be an usher, too.  Anyhow, then that evening we're going to UTSA for the school's production of  Messiah  which should be very good, because the events are always free, but this one was $2/$5 (depending on if you are a student or not).    I'm also getting very excited because I get to see all of my family next week for Thanksgiving!  I haven't seen my brother in about a month, and I miss him terribly.  He and I always have so much fun together, but he rarely gets to come here to San Antonio.  I think I'll attempt going to Houston to visit him soon.  Especially since he just moved into his new place.  Maybe I'll go sometime over my Christmas break.  I'll have time to do it then.  Anyhow, I'll also get to see all my little cousins and my cousin Kim and her husband Tim.  As well as my Grandma, whom I haven't seen in quite a bit.  It should prove to be interesting, as Thanksgiving in our family ALWAYS does.  Maybe I should talk about the stupid Thanksgiving tradition of watching  urlLink Rio Bravo .  Watch it sometime... it's an okay movie, and I'd probably enjoy it more myself if I hadn't seen it so many times.  Every Thanksgiving.  And it's a DUBBED version (dubbed over, rather in english by EVERY GUY in the family who has the entire dialogue memorized).  It's just going to be weird for me to see my youngest cousin Travis, because I haven't seen him in almost a year.  He's almost 2, and I'm sure that he's changed a great deal since the last time I saw him.  I wonder how "two" he is.  Hehe  I know ALL about kids that are very "two" being that I worked with the 2 year olds at the daycare.  Oh my... yeah, it's stressful to work with 2 year olds.    Completely moving onto a different topic, in January they're opening the Child Development Center at the UTSA Main Campus!  YAY!  I think I'll try getting a job there (if my schedule permits) and I'd also like to get a job there for the summer, maybe.  If I don't get a job with them, I'll probably seriously look into working with the YMCA childcare program, or with Trinity Christian Academy, since they're opening a new place up over off 1604.  I love working with kids, and I really want to work with kids again, but I think I'll definitely request working with ages 3 or older.  2 year olds are just sometimes too much to take, especially if there's 8-10 of them.  Plus, I don't want to do the diaper thing so much anymore.  I really liked working with the kids that were potty training.  It was such a feeling of accomplishment when they finally were potty trained, and I knew that I helped in their learning that.  Anyhow, that's all I have for now, kiddos!  I'll post something later...      urlLink  postCount('Name');
