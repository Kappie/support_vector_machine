IN CAPS  yeah, I know it doesn't really matter but I'm gonna have titles from now on. w00t  I'm much much better than I was this weekend, thanks for asking((bitches!))((kidding, kidding)).  ok so I didn't blog Sunday because I was busy watching the academy awards. I feel so stupid after I spend 6 hours listening to awards I could care less about diluted with endless acceptance speeches and tributes to Sidney portiers, but hey. Other than that Sunday was a bore, and all I did was procrastinate. But I was glad that whenever they were announcing an award I could say "lord of the rings?" and always be correct. Besides, LOTR did deserve it, those people worked their asses off.  procrastinate about what? A holocaust poem. Luckily I'm so poetically inclined((inept)) I was able to produce a masterpiece((master-piece of shit, that is)) in the four minutes I had left before school on Monday. I know the holocaust is important and stuff like that, but I hate((abhor))strongly dislike((can't stand)) writing about it. It's kind of like writing about September 11, everything that could be said has been said and then said again, making the whole process a bore and effectively losing the importance of the event by overly pursuing minor details.  speaking of Jewish people, I am completely sick of hearing about Mel gibbousness movie. Lately with all this Passion of the Christ/Ash Wednesday stuff, the topic of religion has been highly discussed and, in my case, highly avoided if possible. I do not believe in god, and I can't ever remember doing so. I can remember being dragged to Baptist church((by my grandmother I call Mimi)) and never really getting anything out of it. I can remember going to a private Christian school and kids telling me to accept god into my heart, and wondering if maybe there was something wrong with me when nothing happened. I can remember when my sister was baptized and people wondered why I wasn't getting baptized also. I can remember going on a catholic retreat with a friend of mine and finding the whole experience uncomfortable and quite fruitless. And  even when I was a small child and didn't know there were other things besides "god is good and atheists are going to hell"... Not only did I have no idea what an atheist was, I had no idea why I couldn't get god, so since I could form my own coherent opinions, I've had no organized religion to conform to. I've often wondered if maybe I am the same as all "Christians" that maybe they had "asked god into their hearts" and when they got no reply, instead of doing as I had and escaping the religion, had simply lied to conform the group. Or maybe they had been told of the sensation you have when you "get god" and after trying hard enough, had simply imagined the whole thing. I suppose I'll never know.   so what exactly do I believe? Unlike the average highschool student, I don't feel that we are souless, godless, and pointless creatures destined to die. One of the biggest points that I stand on is the fact that nobody knows exactly what happens after we die, and that makes every religion worth existing. From Christianity to Buddhism to bobism to Muslim, they all have equal chances of being the right answer, which is why I have respect for whatever path people choose and have a "don't try changing me and I won't try changing you" attitude. The path that I have chosen, however, is one without a "god" but a high level of spirituality. I believe that the spirit and the body are two defined elements that can exist without one another((some would call it dualism)) and that the spirit never dies. I belief that there are many planes the spirit can inhabit, and that as your spirit grows, it moves to new planes. I believe that until your spirit is ready to leave a certain plane, it will begin new lives and continue to compound it's knowledge until it can move on. So yes, I believe that we have all had past lives and the older your soul, the wiser you are. I believe in the flow of energy, and how anything can be manipulated if enough energy is put into it. So yes again, I believe you can heal, move things, affect the outcome of things, with your mind, if you try hard enough((which, I believe, is why praying is such a major staple in all religions, the more energy you put into something by "praying" the more likely it will turn out right)). I believe that some spirits may choose to wander in between planes before moving to another or beginning a new life. So yes, I believe in ghosts. And finally((since I'm sick of talking about it)) I believe that the barrier between the earth and the void((that is, the space in between planes)) can be entered while your spirit is still on earth and that your spirit can travel earth without killing the body. So yes, I believe in astral projection and meditation.  and what do I think about the bible??? I think most of it is not true. The easiest way to prove my point would be to ask "if all those things happened, you know, lepers being healed and being  swallowed by whales and such, why doesn't any of tit happen now?". now someone who had thought long and hard about it would say "but it does happen now! People are cured everyday and new and amazing things are happening" to which I would reply "yes, but all of those things have ways of being scientifically proved, whereas, last time I checked, "miraculously" is not a viable reason for someone to be cured and according to the bible it happened all the time back then" to which they would reply "well shi-ut".  the last few days have been fairly uneventful. I had guitar and he "taught" me how to read tabs. I guess he forgot that I told him I taught myself to read tab, so he was all amazed when he showed me the notes to the star spangled banner and I plucked it out perfectly. He gave me a website that's supposed to be chocked full of free tab and I'm going to check it out in a sec. But meanwhile I want a couple suggestions on songs from you guys that have good guitar licks in them and that I could get the music for.  ok that's it for now kids. Maybe another post later on? I'm in a bloggety blog mood.
