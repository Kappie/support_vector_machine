How we will get there is beyond me as neither of us is any god at directions.  We will probably get as far as Hr. Grace and start asking for directions to New Perlican.  Townies, they don't know nothing!  I"m still a little sick, but I am no beginning to think of this 'illness' as a bell curve.  I"m back to where I was about 4 days ago.  So this must mean that in a day or two it will be gone.  or I"ll be dead.  Whichever, the pain will be over soon.  Ok, so I"m off.  This will either be a huge pain in the ass for me and Kathy, or it will be a great time full of a whole family of drunkards.  Who knows?
