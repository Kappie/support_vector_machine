After the Ceremony we went to this really nice pub, and had loads of nice food and took loads of photos. and then some of us went back to my aunties house (my family, my grandparents and my mums uncle and his sons) and all the kids, we were all in the garden mucking around. I was looking after Katie, megan and debbie were mucking around, and my brother was playing football with ricky, ben and dean. I dont no where emma was, apparantly her family havent seen her since easter when she walked out, and she didnt come to the wedding.  It was really nice to be able to see everyone again. Ricky has the cutest cat, and his cat has kittens and they have two left, and they were trying to get my mum to bring it home but my dad wouldnt let us have it. It was soooo cute, it was ginger and white and i really wanted it. But what i was really amazed about was that me and ben are still quite close and so are me and Katie and we havent seen eachother for three years. since the christening. Ben was winding me up like he always does, telling dean to get me and kick the football at me but we both wind eachother up so we're even. as for Katie, she delighted in giving me a tour of the house, and dragging me outside and inside and outside and inside! It was such a good day. cant wait until the baby is born and it has its christening! But then there will be 7 kids!!!! god ive blabbered!
