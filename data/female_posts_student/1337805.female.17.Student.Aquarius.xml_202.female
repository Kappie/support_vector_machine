Technology at school has hit a standstill, I was kicked off one of the fast, good computers and now I sit on one of the slowest computers in history, the cd player skips if someone walks by, or if the comouter is thinking too much, and even the simplest of tasks becomes a mountain of challanges. It bytes.  I've just been handed the form that my group will submit to the teacher to be able to film our movie, "Life after the Couch". Hopefully he'll approve it without asking what we will specifically do, because otherwise we're screwed. One of my parts is to be a casual hooker, walking by :) My other parts include director of filming and sound, and then we all get to edit it.   Last night, MSN was having difficulties with its server and technology, and as a result, MSN Messenger was down most of the night. This angered me, and it angered a lot of my friends, because we all wanted to talk, and we couldn't. Hotmail was luckily working, and lots of time was spent madly sending off emails back and forth to each other. Hearing everyone's stories today made me realize that a lot of people are now sickly reliant on the computer and the internet to talk to friends, family and co-workers. Neighboors rely on it. Best friends. Family. What ever happened to picking up the phone and calling them? Going over to their house and visiting them? I suppose the convience of being able to talk to more than one person at the same time lures people into the chatware cult, and prevents them from functioning like our families did not too long ago. No one wants to go outside, no one wants to play with their friends and build forts and dream about faroff lands, no one wants to breakout the legos and have a darn fun time with their imagination. It's sickening.  Sanford, I'm glad I got to talk to you last night, and I'm glad you decided to stick around with us on Earth for a bit longer.
