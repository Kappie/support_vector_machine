But only 4 are directly necessary for an assignment, so I will probably only skim those and skip the other books entirely. I'm not really sure why professors think we will read so much, because I'm only barely getting by on the reading that I do get done.   So, about my weekend: accordions in the cemetery, and barbecues with homeowners. Yep, a truly surreal and strange experience--and that was just the homeowners. My mom has revived her love of accordions and as such has joined an accordion band. Who knew that she was so cool and alternative? They were hired for their first gig to play for this modern dance troop in the Mountain View cemetery in Piedmont; the music was entrancing and beautiful, and fit the surroundings well, but the dancing was, well, weird. The most painful moments were when they danced without music and embraced mausoleums. The best was when they ran around the fountains with flags. But mostly, it was weird, so I zoned out and looked at the amazingly cool surroundings of the cemetery. A lot of really cool architecture and sculpture, and there were even some famous California families buried there. Like the Ghirardellis and Charles Crocker, one of the "big four" who paid for the transcontinental railroad and got stinking rich--one of the four founded a university. You might have heard of it. Can you say Stanford? Yep. Stinking rich.  So then on Sunday I managed to get very little work done as well, because we went to a barbecue held by Dave and Alexa, with some of their neighbors. It was weird, because they talked a lot about their houses: improving their houses, how much their houses were worth, how weird their neighbors could be, and many other equally bizarre topics that renters just don't talk about. I'm not sure if I want to join the homeowners cult. It's a little too intense and exclusive these days. It costs a lot of money to join that club!
