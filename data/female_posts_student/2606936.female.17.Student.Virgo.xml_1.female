However, I am trying to figure out the formula for ammonium chloride.  Our band directors are out of town at a state music teachers' convention, so in band we were sitting around and "studying." My friend L walks into the room and looked a littel down, so i'm all "hey, what's up?" and she just asked where some other girls were. I pointed them out and as she walked off i saw tear tracks on her cheeks.  She came to me about ten minutes later, beckoned me away from the crowd, and told me, "B's getting expelled."  I immediately assumed something had gone terribly wrong and was like, what the heck did the school try to pull on us now..... and asked why.  Turns out she and another girl, during a lab in their chemistry class, randomly thought it would be a nice idea to drink ammonium chloride.  She freaking drank a chemical in a high school lab. After all the safety contracts we have to sign, after all the rules we have to memorize, and while they're even protecting your SKIN from it.   This is so weird. The other girl, everyone tells me, is pretty dumb and reckless. But B? She's got more common sense than that. I don't know if it was a dare, or what. L said she was laughing about it and said, "Oh, I don't know why I did that...."  She could be expelled or suspended..... It makes absolutely no sense. IT's the kind of ridiculous story chem teachers tell to wake up kids. Like, the one about the boy who put sodium (sulfur? some S-starting element that combusts upon contact with water) in his front pants pocket and then went swimming. B's story will become one soon.  How can you ever know someone? I mean, we weren't freakishly close, but I would have given her the benefit of the doubt. Who the hell drinks ammonium chloride in school?   To all of you in my locale, please don't comment on this here, because I don't want to further the gossipy crap already perpetuated.  To all of you out there in Blog Land, please try to refrain from randomly ingesting chemicals you're told not to ingest.
