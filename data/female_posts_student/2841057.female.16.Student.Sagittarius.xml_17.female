Good thing it was still accepted even though we're a little late. We got late because of that damn traffic.   Anyway, I'm here at home talking to my computer imagining the crowd at the Incubus' concert. Damn coz I miss it. But then it's alright coz I got loads of works to do. I need my time. They just made a wrong timing and I guess it's just their first and they'll go back. I'm not in the mood to booze an energy in a concert. I'm tired and what I really like is a relief. Something calming...something like a beach.
