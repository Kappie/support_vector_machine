I would make me list in November and always say "I want this...I want that" I wanted everything.  And I always got what I wanted.   Everything.  Now, the thigns I ask for have gotten bigger and more expensice. I don't get much anymore.  We don't have as much money. Its not like we are poor or anything..  Now, I sleep in on christmas day.  I don't really care for the tree or the lights, or  anything.  I don't really care about God either.  He doesn't seem to matter. Here I am...sitting...at the computer.  Wasting my day away when I could be doing something...  something worthwhile, something that will make a difference.  But I fear I will never make a difference.  I can never change the world.   But I can sure try.
