Spell your name with bands/singers:  Huey Piano Smith  The Clowns Everclear Arrogant Worms Tenacious D Harper, Ben Etta James R.E.M.  Aimee Mann Nina Simone Nash, Leigh  Have you ever had a song written about you?  Well,  yeah .  "Heather Ann, Heather Ann, does whatever a Heather can..."  Besides ripping off the Spiderman theme, there was a lovely arrangement of the Mission Impossible theme, sung by Janice and her three sisters (all with different parts!), where the only lyrics were "Heather Ann!"  Oh, and then there was the Pepper Ann theme song—"Heather Ann, Heather Ann, much too cool for seventh grade, Heather Ann, she's one in a millION!!"  What can I say.  My friends were bored in high school.  What song makes you cry?  Well, I am an INTJ and we never cry (right, Sanda? damn straight!) unless we are crying from laughter, but if I DID cry, it might be to something like "The Drugs Don't Work" by The Verve.  What song makes you happy?  Lots of them... for some reason my first thought was of the Finland song by Monty Python.  "You're so near to Russia, so far from Japan, quite a long way from Cairo, lots of miles from Vietnam, Finland, Finland, Finland... Finland has it all!"  What do you like to listen to before bed?  Something pretty and sad, like "Lay Me Down" by The Frames.  What color pants are you wearing right now?  I must confess a lack of pants at this precise moment.  What song are you listening to now?  The Kinks - Everybody's Gonna Be Happy  What taste is in your mouth?  I just got up.  Let's not talk about that just yet.  What's the weather like?  Clear blue skies, it's gonna be NICE today, which is perfect, because I don't have a job yet, so I can go OUTSIDE!  How are you?  Qanuinngittunga.  (I'm fine.)  Do you get motion sickness?  No, I'm the chick who can read in the car for hours and hours and hours.  Do you have a bad habit?  I drink tea in my room all the time and end up with half of our cups on my desk.  Then I blame the cat.  Do you get along with your parents?  Yes, so well.  Heh.  My parents.  They make me laugh.  Do you like to drive?  Yeah, but I wouldn't like it in Toronto, I don't think.  I never get to drive.  But I have the TTC, it gets me around.  Favorite TV show?  Alias, but I download it.  The only thing I watch on TV anymore is The West Wing, and that's for bonding time with Kathy, my addicted roommate.  Except that now I'm addicted too.  I can't help it, they are so sarcastic and witty and then I love them!  Favorite conditioner?  I have Dove right now, it's pretty swell.  Favorite video game?  DR. MARIO ALL THE WAY!!  Favorite book?  The Bible.  (Heh.)  I jest, I jest!  Don DeLillo's "White Noise" would be in my Top 5, hard to pick a favourite.  "Franny and Zooey" by J.D. Salinger, "Holy the Firm" by Annie Dillard, "High Fidelity" by Nick Hornby, "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy (which I have read, and I would marry Andrew Bolkonski in a SECOND, even though marriage scares the crap out of me—my love for him is that strong!).  Favorite magazine?  Wired/Beyond.  Would be The Believer or McSweeney's if I was cool enough.  Favorite drink?  Might be eggnog.  Heh.  Also a fan of tea, orange juice (addict!), coconut juice, mango shakes, bubble tea, coffee... Wait, is this about alcohol?  Favorite thing to do on the weekend?  Besides sleeping in?  Umm... actually seeing my friends is nice sometimes.  Oh!  Going to Chinatown and eating egg tarts with the lovely  urlLink Meredi .  That's been nice.  Favorite band/group/singer?  I love Cake more than life itself, but lately Damien Rice has been stealing my heart.  Have you broken the law?  Failure to yield at an intersection, baby.  I'm hardcore.  :)  Have you run away from home?  Yeah, but I was hoping that I would get to sleep in the play structure in the backyard and still come home for meals.  Mom wasn't too keen on that.  Have you ever gone skinny dipping?  Actually, no.  Have you ever made a prank phone call?  No, but I've actively encouraged others to do so.  Have you ever tipped over a Porta-Potty?  No.  Have you ever used your parents' credit cards?  Yes.  With their permission.  Have you ever skipped school?  Have you ever tried taking New Testament with either Olu or Stevie T?  It is impossible not to skip class after that.  Though I skipped plenty before that too.  See also: morning classes.  Have you ever fallen asleep in the shower/bath?  No.  What??  I am way too paranoid about drowning for that kind of nonsense.  Have you ever been in a school play?  I got kicked out of the seventh grade production of that musical with the song "Old Man River" or something... I don't even remember what it was.  I got kicked out for talking during rehearsal.  My teacher was a bitch.  We gave her a nervous breakdown.  Serves her right, kicking me out for talking, mutter mutter mutter.  But I was the narrator for a play in grade 1 because of my superior reading skills!!  YEAH!  Have you ever let a friend cry on your shoulder?  Of course.  Children?  I have none.  But I like them.  They taste like chicken.  Have you ever been in love?  I have no idea.  I'll go with no.  I've really really liked people, but "in love" is kind of a heavy phrase.  Have you ever had a hard time getting over someone?  Kind of.  Have you ever been hurt?  Yes.  Your greatest regret?  I don't know.  Not buying 'Boondock Saints' when I had the opportunity.  Losing my faith.  Wait, no, I don't regret that at all.  Umm...  not knowing how to talk to my grandmothers, and now they're dead and I can't.  Do you have a job?  No, but I'm working on that.  In your MP3 player right now:  Clint Mansell/Kronos Quartet - Ghosts of a Future Lost (Requiem for a Dream soundtrack)  If you were a crayon, what color would you be?  Flesh.  And I would still be white.  And I would be racist.  What makes you happy?  Bare feet, buds on trees, the St. Lawrence River, seeing people talk about the thing they love most in the world and get so excited, Sanda's "le tired", Melissa's "--||--", pretending to argue with people just because we think it's funny, teasing my Mom, having teachers tell me I rock.  Who makes you the happiest?  Norman Reedus.  No, I'm kidding.  I don't know.  All of my friends.  I love you guys to little bits.  What's the next CD you're gonna get?  Well, if I still spent money on music, I would be buying "Mayhem Mystics" by Azeem.  Spoken word poetry/hiphop.  Yo, I'm down with that, homie.  Whom do you consider good friends?  This is the trick question where people get offended that they're not on the list right?  Fine then!  Janice, Mike, Sanda, Sandra, Kathy, Melissa, Meredi, Gabe, Erin, Ness... surely there are others, I don't know.  What do you like to do?  Stuff.  I'm pretty keen on stuff.  Stuff like sitting on MSN all day, haha.  Okay, really... reading, writing, playing piano, being stupid with Sanda, walking around in the forest, hanging out with people one-on-one, going out for vietnamese/thai food, biking, playing old-school Nintendo games and sucking at it...  When was the last time you cried?  INTJS DON'T CRY.  Okay, fine.  We do.  But we don't own up to it!  When was the last time you got a real letter?  Around my birthday.  From Sanda.  w00t!  When was the last time you got e-mail?  Today, from my Dad, yay!  What was the last thing you purchased?  Besides food... dresses!  What was the last TV program you watched?  Alias  What was the last movie you saw at the theatre?  Return of the King
