I'm almost writing this subconsciously. Thoughts pouring - can't focus. Starts with Soco song I'm tuning out to - school - hate - anger - razor blades - blood. Walking on razor blades. Drawn in anime. Girl - beautiful - long, brown wavy hair. Running... from what? Bandages colored a deep red covering her arms. Thinking of a title... to name this... blurred visions. "It's not what it seems. Nothing's the same when you give it away." Soco... playing... "This family's breaking down and it's not what it seems." Hate - Anger. Running again. WHAT IS SHE RUNNING FROM?! Tears. Pouring... like my thoughts - my dreams - my hate - my anger - my jealousy. Beauty. Painted nails - deep, blood red. "Now she's shutting down."  Where did it start? Why can't I have any good memories? Memories full of anger. Bitter rivalry. Jealousy. Hate. Destruction. Plates falling, breaking into pieces, shattered. Slamming doors with gaping holes. Anger forming words... yelling. Jealousy. Betrayal. Hate. Bad habits. Imperfections. Mine. Hers. Theirs. Uncontrollable. "Nothing's the same when you give it away."  The lines... creases... in my hands. The holes. The pores. Blood seeping out, dripping to the floor. Puddles staining the floor. Lines. Jealousy.  What do they tell you? Split ends. Hair pulled by the roots. Same song... repeating... revealing the story that I can't find the words to tell. Can't filter the thoughts. "And now she's shutting down." Disapproval. Jealousy. Competition. Anger. Disposable babies. Texture of the walls, skin, the paper, the pores. YOU'RE A WASTE OF ROTTING HUMAN FLESH! Emotions burning holes inside out. Pain of the touch... unforgiven. YOU'RE A FAT WHORE! Abuse... slaps... pushing... kicking... hitting... The hate. The anger. Building. Overworked. Tears burning the flesh from the bones. Erosion. BULLSHIT! Feel the blood drip... splatter on the floor. Imagine the ripple. "This family's breaking down." No support system... falling apart. Hate. Anger. Telephone ringing. Wrong number. Always wrong number. Prank calls - accidental calls. Hear their laughs... laughing at me. Hello? They don't hear you. - no one hears you. Thunder. No one. No response. "And now she's shutting down." Distant colors. Uncontrollable thoughts. Rambling. Everything at once. Feel the cold blade against the skin. Gently. Ravaging. Hemorrhage. Jealousy. Cutting me apart. Drive. Just drive. Mountains. Sun. Stars... visible at the same time. The moon falls. Ripples across the surface of the exploding earth. Thoughts pouring.   Blurred visions.
