Auntie Lay Suan says: "1, 2, 3, 4" and plays the harmony I'm still starring wondering what on earth to sing out.   I seriously nearly cried during piano lesson just now. Out of fustration, of course.. (my teacher is a very nice lady) Sightsinging is so tough. I have no idea what the notes sound like. I try to connect but by the time i start singing in my head, the song has ended.  I am doomed.  My pieces  scales, SAVE ME!   Btw, I've been wondering, is it possible to learn piano up to my level WITHOUT being musical?  Can it like suddenly *DAWN* on you that you're not musical? Cos it feels like it now.
