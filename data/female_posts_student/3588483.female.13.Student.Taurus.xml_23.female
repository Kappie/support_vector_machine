Boohooo! I also bought FFX-2. Thats so great, but one very important thing is missing..:  TIDUS!  Damn, there aint no good FFX without him! In FFX Yuna used to annoy me so much, that I'd like to take a nearby chair and smash things with it.  Boy, I hated her.  Her japanese(original) voice wouldnt prolly been so bad as the english one. Ugh. But Seymours voice! Oh my goodness gracious, thats  TERRIBLE! So awful! Everytime I hear Seymour talk, these chills run down my spine. And what's with his HAIR? O_o; And his nails? The whole guy is totally creeping me out? James Arnold taylor did a good job, but...his voice was...mebbe a pretty too much high pitched ^^; But as I was saying, Yuna isn't annoying at all in the FFX-2. But the singing scenes are quite...barbie-like.  (ewww)  Paine and Rikku are cool too. But FFX is so the greatest :3 *meow* Its weird how many peoplelike TidusXSeymour slash. X( I mean, those are the worst things I can imagine >_ best!  :3 TidusXAuron isnt too shabby either...But thats enough about that.
