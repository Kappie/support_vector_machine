Now all the happiness is gone and I'm left with the depressed/sick at myself mood. I think it was all that Mountain Dew I drank. I think it was the caffeine and sugar. It was a good feeling though. I guess it just shows that caffeine really is a drug and it did give me a strange reaction. I don't think it's as prevalent in other people because they drink it all the time. I rarely ever drink any caffeine and yesterday I was relatively overdosed on it.  I feel lousy. What a lousy day it's been. What a lousy person I am.
