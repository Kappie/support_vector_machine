I have a feeling I'll lose count.  But I think it'd be interesting to write down the names of the songs too, just to see the kind of things that just come to my head sometimes.  Camp will be extremely interesting - I can honestly predict that. I'm a little worried about the whole Ms Roberts thing ... but I'll finish the essay tomorrow night (I had to work today ... no time).  Tomorrow morning I've gotta drop by Safeway, and seeing as I'm going to wag VCE music, I was thinking what I'd do is leave at the end of people and politics, tram into Kew - go to Safeway there, and then tram back in time for recess. All I gotta do is forge a note of permission, and I've done that plenty of times.  I really shouldn't have written that down. That's evidence against me. But I've decided to ask Mum if I can leave school instead. That's right, I've now got Mum's permission and a note from her, so no-one has to worry at all. I'm perfectly innocent. I would never ever do something like that ... no way, that's just not me. So just forget what I wrote above, because all is well now.  I'm going to tape Mallrats tonight ... infortunately over the top of Small Claims - but I'm going to but that on DVD when it comes out anyway.
