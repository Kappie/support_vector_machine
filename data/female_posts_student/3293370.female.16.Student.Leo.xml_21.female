What we had was something special and it lasted for such a short time. It seems to unfair. We hung out last night, me, Jay, Mark and Jasmin and, I don't know about the rest of them, but it was an awesome time. I miss those times with Jasmin. We barely talk anymore, but when we hang out we have so much fun and we're always laughing. I miss being able to talk to her and tell her stuff. She wasn't always the best person to talk to because she didn't talk back and didn't have much advice to give but I miss that feeling of being comfortable enough to tell her anything. I wonder if she misses me too. And we've talked about this before but it didn't really go anywhere. You can't have a talk and then decide that you're best friends again. These things come with time. However, I might just be the most impatient person on the face of the earth so that doesn't really work for me. Sigh.   Mark is in Calgary. I miss him. How sad is that? I suppose distance is a true test of faith or whatever, but come on. It's been like 2 weeks. And I think his best friend is hot. That is sooo bad. Hahaha. I kinda have problems looking Mark in the face. Erm, yeah. I really like him for who he is and all, but he's not much of a looker. I'm not saying that I like him any less because of it; I've always prided myself in being able to see the inner beauty and all that crap but stiiiiiill ... TRACY MCGRADY or BRAD PITT!!! Is that so much to ask for? Ok, don't answer that.
