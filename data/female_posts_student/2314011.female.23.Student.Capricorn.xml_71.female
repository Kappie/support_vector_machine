And no, I can't just research it on my own, so don't ask.    So I'm about to settle in with my nightly jug of tea after my nightly (you guessed it) yoga practice.  I'm addicted, what can I say?    "I have hot calves!" is what I can say!  They actually have muscle-mass.  For the first time since I was 9!  I have calf muscles!!  My upper-arms are even joining in!  I realize this is probably less than invigorating news for the lot of you, but, for me, this is really big shit.  I've always wanted to have that sculpted, toned look that goes oh-so-well with tank-tops, but without having to actually go to the gym.  And now I'm on my way to exactly that.  Yay.  Look out June!    Picked up a dirty Mexican movie along with some hot lesbain stand-up comedic action on the side, so the night should be an exciting one.  Don't really want to ruin the great run the player's on with the Winter Mix.  Discovered something new about my temperamental player:  if I just let it run on one disc continuously, all the way through, even a burned disc, it doesn't throw a fit.  I may even be able to put a single disc on "Random."  But as soon as I start skipping songs or throwing the "All Disc" format together with "Random", it starts to whine.  I'll figure this damn thing out yet.  And keep you all posted, too.  Speaking of which, can I just say (in all seriousness) how much I adore my latest regular reader?  Because I do; even more than she loves to hate writing assignments.
