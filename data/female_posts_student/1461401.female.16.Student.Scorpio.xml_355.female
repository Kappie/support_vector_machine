I need like tenmillion asprin and some major comfort foods. And a hug. Or a pillow. Or both! All rolled into one. They should sell pillows with arms for lonely women. I'd buy three. One good thing about sleeping so much today, is that I'm not so tired while watching latenight anime. Just sore. *sigh* Welcome home.   lets do lunch
