Just some insides about the movie, without spilling everything...of course, Legolas has his one ultra-awesomely cool fight/action scene (with a combination of about 20 lines or so in the entire movie).  The best!  So freakin' awesome.  Words simply can't describe.    And then there were the SAT II's today.  It was so weird, I kept finishing before everyone else.  When I was done with all the questions, I had about 10 minutes left, and I was thing....."um.....this can't be good."  The math was pissed me off so much.  Whenever I skipped a question, I would forget, and fill in that space for the next question.  I realized around 3 questions afterwards and had to fix it.  BUT, it happened more than once, oh no, guess how many.....like 5.  Yeah, I know, slow!  The literature was soo incredibly boring.  When I was using the prep book, they actually had some pretty interesting stories, but not this time.  And it was pretty difficult, which sucked!  (Oh, the events being posted are not in order.) Skateboarded after the movie and was a blast.  My friend has this HUGE one; it's up to my nose.  But really easy to turn in and really cool.  Great fun today.
