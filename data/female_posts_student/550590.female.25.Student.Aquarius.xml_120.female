Just think, I have to put up with this crap ALL YEAR LONG!!  Blah blah blah, get out of Florida, blah blah.  Yeah, I know, I know.  It will happen...sooner or later.  I also took a much needed nap, so I'm up, awaiting the phone call to let me know Bruce has indeed made it safely to Coral Springs (Oral Springs?) so that I can rest peacefully and prepare for the hellashopping that will be done on Friday morning.  So the goals for this weekend include getting a bit of writing done, getting a bit of reading done...attempting to update (or get rid of) my geocities site and maybe see a few folks while I'm in town.  On the list are Andy B., Thomas, Ryan, Judd, Renee, and maybe some more of the Trinity folks that I've begun to forget anything other than their screennames considering Yoda has yet to arrange a reunion for us thus far this year.  Then there's the traditional Thanksgiving weekend crap: putting up the fake tree, putting up the lights, bitching at my mother, attempting to balance my father's giant Christmas Village on top of my poor baby grand piano, and keeping my parents from feeding the dogs too much Turkey.  Short story long, I'm gonna be bored this weekend, folks, so give a call to the cell or an email.  It could be worse, I could be in Miami...
