It was so cheesy that I think it is going to make people drink even more.  The little film from MADD (Mothers Ag ainst Drunk Driving) tried to portray these pitiful situations in which teens were killed or dramatically affected by alcohol.  It was just so unreal for a Catholic college prep school.  People were just laughing the whole time and whispering to their friends.  It was pretty sad. I think more thought needed to be put into it.  Maybe personal stories from the Mitty community--that would have made things more real.  At the end of the film, this representative from MADD said this whole thing how everyone in school can be positively or negatively affected by your actions and that they will all come to your funeral.  Huh?  I've concluded that that assembly was a total waste of time.  Anyhoo, I go to find out about my other blood test results this afternoon.  I'm kind of nervous and a little worried.  I'll post later to let ya'll know of the outcome.  Gotta go to class!  w
