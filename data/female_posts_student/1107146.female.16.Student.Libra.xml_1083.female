(It might have been a Leigh Anne ploy.)(Last night we were talking about being friends, which she sees as a definite impossibility.)(I don't care, click  urlLink here  to see why.)(She said Lizzy stole my number from her and called it; YEAH RIGHT, I surely believe that.)(Seth had more fun when he got home, as he called Lizzy about three more times.(I was on the phone with Leigh and Lizzy was talking to her on AIM.)(She was freaking out, it was the funniest thing ever.)(But anyway.)  (Yeah, can't you just hear me doing a lounge singer voice with this text?)(So cool.)  (Alright, I'm done doing drugs.)
