My two little cousins came over on konrads side of the family so they r not blood related. Infact they arn't even blood related to konrad but anyways since they r 8 and 5 we went to Quassy and Zoe came too so i wouldn't be bored.    I found out that the 8yr old cousin, Seth kind of likes me lolz. He always is looking at me from around a corner or something and then i would  turn around and he would hide it was so funny. Me and Zoe were crakin up.    At Quassy we didn't do much well i didnt... Me and zoe went on that swing ride and then we had a water balloon fight. And we went on the marry go round like 3 times lolz. And we got our pictures tacken too. And i went on that lil baby helicopter ride and down that flush slide thing...    Then today Konrad's Work had a picnic and we went. Except i didnt want to go becouse me and my bro kept fighting but i was forced to go... so I wasn't in the mood so as soon as i got there i just went to this huge rock and layed on it out in the sun. But eventelly my mom came over and picked me  up off the rock and carried me over to this rock climbing wall and then bot konrad to take my feet and my mom took my arms and they were dragging me to the wall. and my shoes fell and this kid went and got them for me. Thats wen it started... The kid sort of liked me He was 13 going on 14 and kind of wierd. my mom could totally tell he liked me so she kept teasing. er and yeah it ws kind of intresting... so yeah.     ttyl    samie
