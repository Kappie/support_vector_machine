On Sundays the mall closes at 6pm so I was all hyped when 5:30pm rolled around and I could almost get my ass out of there. Then walks in a mom, daughter and a son. The son is what you would call "mentally challenged". He'd stand around "dancing" to the music on the radio while wearing his fanny pack too high and staring at me. Perhaps like we were the only ones there... I really don't know. I'd look over and he would just give me a blank stare back. You know when you feel like someone is looking at you? Well usually when you look at them they look away.. not the case here. It was kind of getting uncomfortable so I would change the way I was standing like lean against the counter or squat down like I was picking something up on the carpet. But when I'd pop back up there he was still. The mom was pestering him across our tiny store by saying "oh I'm going to buy you these Oscar the grouch socks cause your grouchy like him." This annoyed him a lot and he would yell back "mom that's kidâ€™s stuff! I'm over the age of 21!!!" I kind of had to giggle to myself at that one.. I can keep my cool though so I just acted like I wasn't interested in their convo. That was until his next comment when his mom said "you like Oscar don't you?" to where he replied "Fu*ck yes!!!!" I about died when that came out of his mouth... Jesus H Christ that had to be one of the funniest things I have heard a "mentally challenged" person say... EVER. I think it even replaced the  "have you seen my baseball?" or "frank and beans!!" comment on Something About Mary. After saying that he bashfully looked over at me.. just like every other time he blew him mom off. I couldn't get them out of my store fast enough. So I came home last night and told my buddy Davis about it and he came up with a pretty cool idea. You see I have trouble a lot with "mentally challenged" people liking me.... It doesn't matter if they are male or female it's like I am a big shiny piece of metal that attracts them. So Davis and I are going to market shirts that say "tart magnet" instead of the ones you see floating around that say "chick magnet" with a baby chickadee on them. Instead our shirts will have a sweet tart candy on it.. Just to be politically correct of course.
