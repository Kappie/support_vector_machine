Tom Hanks was still in his  Bosom Buddies  persona back then - wacky-irreverent-mr-nice-guy, just like in  Splash ,  Bachelor Party ,  Big ... can't remember exactly when he grew out of that.  Glad he did, though.  So where's April?  Glee?  Jen?  This is kinda fun with 5 of us, but 8 would be so much better!
