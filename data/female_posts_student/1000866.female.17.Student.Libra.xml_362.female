I think my room will actually be finished by the end of September. I'm realllly hoping. I'm going to sponge paint my walls! YaY!!! I really wanted to, and my mom said yes! I'm very excited. I got rid of my nightstand, and I have this really really cool standing lamp. I love it. It's colorful. And then, I'll get my bookcase headboard soon after I get my new computer desk and such. It will be cool.   I should probably go sleep although I'd like to finish cleaning my room. I want to be at school by like, 7:45 tomorrow morning. I don't really want to do the parade much. It's going to be rainy and dreary, and just...blah. I don't think anyone would notice if I just didn't show up. Maybe they would. They'd try to insult me and realize I wasn't there, "Heh, yeah, that idiot girl Nor...heyyy, where IS Norkus?" So, I guess I'll have to go. Ah well, maybe it wont be so bad. Hopefully I'll get to go out with Mary Clare, Kelly, and Kathryn later tomorrow too.  And today....I didn't do much. I went out to lunch with Chris and Jim. That was fun. I was really quiet though. I don't know. I was off in my own world then for some reason. My other world rocks. Heh. Wow, I'm weird.   I don't really want to go back to school on Tuesday. I have a feeling I'm going to get that stressed out feeling again for some reason. I have no idea, but I just feel like this year will be all stress and no fun. I don't think I'll end up going to any dances...again. Homecoming Freshman year wasn't so bad, but...eh. I don't know. I just don't want to go back to the homework either. I still have U.S. History homework that I have to do this weekend. It's only been three days. Ahhh.   I've been thinking, I've changed a lot since High School started. I'm not sure how, but I feel like I've changed. I feel like I'm not crazy old me anymore. I'm less gregarious. I'm turning into a secluse. I never would have thought that of myself two years ago. Catie? Alone? No way!   Good song playing...  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you By now, you should have somehow realized what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now...  Anyway, I suppose I'll go back to cleaning, then sleep, then the parade, etc., etc., etc...
