I started crying after she lost her match. I was crying for how far she had come, only to fall short at the last hurdle. I'm sure many Singaporeans felt the same. Today's papers showed Jia Wei crying when she told PM Lee that she had lost the match and that she was sorry she could not give Singapore her medal. PM Lee told her, however, that sports isn't just about medals. It's about trying again and again, never to give up. *applauds* I really felt for her then. I knew she was visibly upset when she played that match. Her eyes showed no determination at all. They showed tiredness. She had given up. However, she stood tall as an Olympian, never breaking till she left the court. That was when she started to cry. Poor girl. What ticked me off was that some idiot on the Team Singapore forum said that Jia Wei was not fit to be Singaporean. Who is he to criticise her? Has he done ANYTHING for Singapore? If he hasn't, he ought to shut up. His command of English by the way, leaves much to be desired. I, of course, flamed him back with a string of civilised degrading words in perfect English. Many others did too of course. We wouldn't let him bully Jia Wei like that. She's already so upset. It wouldn't do to make her even more upset. It would affect her mentally.  She, the Table Tennis team, Lee Wung Yew (shooter) and Stanley Tan (sailor) are coming back next Tuesday, 31st August at 5.50am. Oh my god!! That's so early! I wanted to go there with Meixi to welcome them home. Looks like my hopes are dashed. Kerry's quite sure she's going though. I've made her promise me to get an autograph and if possible, for me to talk to Jia Wei on the phone for awhile to tell her what I want to say. Jia Wei, you've done VERY VERY WELL as an Olympian. Being able to finish 4th in the world is NO MEAN FEAT for a citizen of this Lilliputian dot of a nation. =) I'm so proud of you! I am an athlete myself and have tasted different degrees of success and failure. I understand how you feel. The media has put immense pressure on you to do well. I think that was so wrong of them. They shouldn't have done that. They know well that Singaporeans would rally behind you. Did you know Orchard Road was apparently empty yesterday because everyone was at home watching and supporting you? We're ONE SINGAPORE!! Don't worry, you're still young and you HAVE the potential to be an Olympic Medallist. I know it'll happen. God will make it happen. When God closes a door, somewhere he opens a window. He closed the door on you yesterday but he opened a window somewhere else. Look for that window and take in the sunshine girl. Singapore loves you, you're a Gold Medallist in our hearts. Fret not, we're behind you all the way!! Jia you!!  On to school matters, had an average day. Just finished my PW report, which is pretty short on my part. Ava wrote further in my notebook her thoughts and feelings. At least TPs are still talking to her. They aren't talking to me much now cuz I mix around with LC. What the H. E. double L. Is it a crime to mix with her? Some people are so insensitive sometimes. Well, you can't blame them. One of them came from a SAP school and didn't know about other races till she entered JC. What a shame. Out of them, she's probably the most cutting of them. Singapore could do away with people like her. Ava's going to get a doodle book for us. We're naming it the Burn Book (after the movie). It'll contain all our memories of JC life. Can't wait for it.  I'm off to sleep now. It's 12.45am. Sigh...my life sucks. I miss you Clay. LoL...yea, Clay...Clay Aiken!  Song: Home 2004 - Young Voices (I'm feeling particularly patriotic tonight after flaming that moronic idiot on the forum in perfect English. Bwah!)
