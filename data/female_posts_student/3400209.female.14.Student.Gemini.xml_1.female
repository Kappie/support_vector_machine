Psychotic Self Injury :  Types of Psychotic Self Injury include the removal or amputation of body parts, such as eyes, limbs, ears, and genitals. These acts of Self Injury are usually done in response to visual or audible hallucinations. This type of Self Injury is severe and is easily identified.    Organic Self Injury :  Organic Self Injury usually stems from autistic disorders, developmental disabilities, and other psychologically induced disorders. This type of Self Injury is always influenced by physical or chemical problems in the body. Forms of Organic SI include head-banging and lip-biting.    Typical Self Injury :  Typical Self Injury results because of emotional or psychological reasons not related to psychotic (hearing voices, seeing things that aren't there, delusions) or organic (physical) conditions. The majority of the people who Self Harm fall into this catergory. This type of Self Harm is used to make yourself feel better and as a way of coping with your life. The following are the most common ways people hurt themselves:   Cutting :  Cutting, also known as slicing or slashing, is the most common way people hurt themselves. It is typically done with a knife, razor blade, piece of glass, or other sharp objects. Most of the cuts are done on the arms, legs, wrists, and chest; but other people cut on other parts of the body such as the stomach, face, neck, breasts, and genitals. But cutting on the arms and wrist is the most common because excuses can be made more easily (for example people can say that they had an accident while cooking).    Burning :  Burning is another common way people hurt themselves. Usually done with cigarettes, lighters, matches, kitchen-stove burners, heated objects (branding irons or hot skillets), and burning objects. Sometimes people even use flammable substances such as gasoline, propane, alocohol, and lighter fluid. Similar to cutting, most people burn themselves on their arms, wrists, legs, and chest.   Interference with wound healing :  Most people have unconsciously interfered with the healing of a wound but it is considered Self Harm when it is done deliberately. Some people remove stitches prematurely, stick objects such as needles, pins, etc. into the wound, or do other things to reopen the wound.    Hitting :  Hitting themselves with their fists is another way that people hurt themselves that is most commonly done on the head or thighs. Although it may not seem as serious as cutting or burning it is done for the same reasons and results.    Extreme nail biting :  It is common for most people to bite their nails. But when it is used as a form of Self Harm it is more severe and frequent than normal. It can result in the injury and damage of the fingernails or cuticles. People can bite their fingernails so much that they draw blood.    Scratching :  Another common thing amongst most people scratching can become a form of Self Injury. People who use it as a method of Self Injury make it more extreme in frequency, intensity, and duration. Area's of skin can become raw or sometimes even bloody. Usually the scratching is done with the fingernails but sometimes it is done with a sharp or semisharp object such as a knife, comb, or pencil. Sometimes it is done unconsciously.    Hair-pulling :  Trichotillomania is 'the excessive and recurrent removal of your own hair resulting in a noticeable loss of hair,' is the only form of Self Injury recognized as a psychological disorder by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Usually the hair is removed from the scalp, eyebrows, or beard, but can be from any part of the body. The bald spots that result from Trichotillomania are usually covered with a hat, bandage, or sunglasses.    Breaking of bones :  A form of Self Injury that is more rare than the others, the breaking of bones is a serious and severe form of Self Injury. Usually, people break their bones with an instrument such as a hammer, brick, or other heavy objects. But sometimes people throw themselves into walls or doors.
