I  know  that ninety percent of the time, most of my giant posts go unread, which is ok, because most of it is for personal benefit, and the rest of you can derive what you want from it. I also think it's important to get every thought down, no matter how contradictory or irrelevent, or in some cases, near psychotic. That's just me for ya.  And coming from a kid who wrote a small book in two years, and who's blog on a 56k connection (dial-up, for example if you don't understand in those terms (but you probably do, dear reader (but I'm thinking too much))) takes well over fifteen minutes to publish on bad days, and ten on good ones, this isn't really surprising. But I shall take the award with all the honor and respect that comes with it. I'd like to thank the Academy, and all my adoring fans.  *kiss kiss to the world*
