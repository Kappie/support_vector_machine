Mr Grossman says he's gonna send in some work to uh I forget where but i need to start something more interesting. Anyways. Me and Josh went shopping today, I'm very sick of shopping now. But this time I actually had money so that was cool. I don't know if everyone's seen My Best Friend's Wedding but... this is my favorite part, when they're on the boat and he says 'remember our song?' and he sings this softly and wow I'm sorry I'm really being dumb and girly right now but GOD DAMMIT i'm a girl and I like chick flicks. This is one of the most romantic songs ever.. god sorry I'm in a sappy mood. *melts*   Just the Way You Look Tonight- Frank Sinatra  Someday, when I'm awfully low, When the world is cold I will feel a glow just thinking of you And the way you look tonight.  Lovely ... Never, ever change. Keep that breathless charm. Won't you please arrange it  'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.  With each word your tenderness grows, Tearing my fears apart... And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart.  And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart.  Someday, when I'm awfully low, When the world is cold I will feel a glow just thinking of you And the way you look tonight. _______________  I also enjoy video games, teenage mutant ninja turtles, batman, and adventure movies where the mighty power of God melts the bad guys' faces off. RADICAL! MOST OUTSTANDING!
