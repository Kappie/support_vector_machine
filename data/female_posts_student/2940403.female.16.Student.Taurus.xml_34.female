Again we got on the topic of how we would settle the car arrangements, and my parents changed their story yet again.  Instead of us switching back and forth where I'd get the car one week and she'd get it two weeks or something like that, they were talking about how she'd get the car until her school was done... which is in late May.  I objected, asking why I couldn't get the car one week and she could get it for two weeks in a row and we'd just drive here to college... as usual, my parents made my idea sound like shit, so they're probably going to let Ellie drive the car whenever she wants, which is probably how it'll be during the summer, too.  I then learned that Ellie was on the Atkins' diet, which I think is absurd because she appears to be very healthy, she's normal weight for her tall stature and she usually eats correctly anyway.  So I said that I thought it was stupid that she was on the diet, and of course she takes it the wrong way by shoving how 'large' I am down my throat, how I'm already the same pants size as her, etc etc.  So now I'm locked in my room crying as usual, thanks to Ellie and her manipulative ways to get my parents to give her everything she wants... leaving me left in the corner feeling worthless.  Where's the bottle of pain killers...
