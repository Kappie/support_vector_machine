The truth is that I just don't understand her directions.  Everytime she explains something it is so confusing.  It's not that I don't want to do the lab, I just never understand the lab.  I never found out what I got on that unit test either, because there was no time, but I really think I did bad and I keep thinking about it.  It's like ALWAYS on my mind.  Social was good today and I think Ali, me, Megz, Erin, Elise, Grant, Kenda, and another guy are going to do Model UN.  Anyways yeah I guess was ok, but Chem was bad.  I thought her demo was interesting, but I felt bad cause I never do anything during labs because I never understand.
