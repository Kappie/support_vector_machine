(the end of school- always busy, summer planning, special people :P, friends, piano, horses) I'm going to try to get back into this. I would like to call your attention to a coming blog- the Seaside Blog (of course, it will eventually have a better name). This year the fabulous four: Virginia, Natalie, Jillian, and Phileda will be blogging their experiences together in Seaside, Florida. This blog is open to all four of us. Please visit it! There's a link on the side of this page. Well, what can I say... Don't buy the D-12 World CD... It's not really worth it... There are a few songs- of course they're all insanely Eminem-typical (depressing, I'm-to-thug-ass-for-my-pants-so-fuck-me, yah u know how he is). I'll Be Damned has a pretty good hook. Of course, My Band is the best music on the whole CD. "How Come" is a pretty good song- catchy music.  I love Britney, as you all know, but her CD In the Zone, yah I've had it for a while know and I'm just really listening to it now, but there are only a few songs that are really good on there. They would be: I Got That Boom Boom featuring the Ying Yang Twins, Toxic, and Everytime.  Joey told me about "Anthem of Our Dying Day", a song by Story of the Year. That's a really good song people! It goes from a sort of light/punk rock to a heavy-metal rock for like 15 seconds, then back to the light-rock.  Yah, I don't know why I felt as if I had to do that- I am just into different kinds of music right now. Like this morning, I pushed the "find a station" button on my stereo and I just listened to whatever it came up with- just not Spanish, lol- What's the point in listening to it- I can't understand it! True- I listen to Spanish when I'm trying to do homework, but this is summer- there IS NO HOMEWORK! HELL YAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So anyway... OMG could it get ANY HOTTER?! It's 100*F with 100% humidity! This is awful.. If this is May, what are July and August going to be like?! Icky. Well I'm selling ads right now for debate. Very very annoying.  I thought of a name for the new foal: Lady Madonna. I think it suits her because she's a little know-it-all and she's very independent and playful. It's a Beatles song. Here's the lyrics:      Lady Madonna, children at your feet.  Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.  Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?  Did you think that money was heaven sent?  Friday night arrives without a suitcase.  Sunday morning creep in like a nun.  Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace.  See how they run.  Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.  Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.  See how they run.  Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,  Listen to the music playing in your head.  Tuesday afternoon is never ending.  Wednesday morning papers didn't come.  Thursday night you stockings needed mending.  See how they run.  Lady Madonna, children at your feet.  Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.     So anyway, I'll have something new to write about tomorrow. L8erz!  Ur friend/enemy/ally/servant/master/competitor/team-mate/lover/chaperone/person/thing/it,  Phileda
