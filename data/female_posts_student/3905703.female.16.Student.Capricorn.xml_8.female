This is one of the few Hindi bands which is really good. They performed all their hits like Door, Sar ki ye, Dhaani, Bole Bole, Anjaane etc. The lead guitarist was really good and I think those of you who missed it, must catch the repeat. Talking about bands I think the Pakistani bands Fuzon and Strings are really good. Fuzon has a very fresh feeling to it. I really love Khamas(Mora Saiyan). Even the video  is a bit different. The way the guy sings is bru..lliant. Tere Bina is also nice. Did you  know its one of the songs of the movie Hyderabd Blues 2.  Finally have got all my papers and managed an average of 81% (Its bad but thats all I could do by studying on the last day before the exams.)
