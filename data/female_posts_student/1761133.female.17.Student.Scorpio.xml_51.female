I'm starting from what I can remember from July 3, 2001. Actually it started way before. My father and mother were constantly fighting. My mom and dad once in a while would come to me and ask my opinion on them getting a divorce. Of course I hated the idea. My mom told me that my dad had a problem; a problem with money. I didn't understand her at first, but afterwards, I knew. She also told me that "they" were going to take me and my brother away. Later did I found out that "they" was the government, because apparently the money problem somehow involved us. This is just the beginning though. My older brother and my dad had problems. I don't know what kind, but it always ended in a fit and crying. I would cry every night because I lived in what I would call a demented family.  On July 2, 2001 was my fathers birthday. My younger brother, me, and my father went out driving in the country just because it's kind of a "thing" we did. But this time we almost drove to Iowa, which scared me for some reason. I had a gut wrenching feeling the whole day. We went back to Rochester and decided to eat at the restaurant "Grandma's Kitchen" to celebrate my fathers birthday. Then we went home and my dad went to one of his daily meetings. My older brother had lock himself into his room, trying to avoid my dad. Once he knew my dad was out, he packed his bags and left. It was his running away from home. I was in the shower at the time; I got my info from my little brother. My dad didn't get back till after I was in bed, like 10-ish. He came into my room because he found out my older brother wasn't home. He was turning beet red; it's either because he was mad or about to cry. He asked me where he went. I said I didn't know. My little brother told me that he left with a guy, one of his friends I'm guessing, so that's what I told him.  The next morning was Wednesday, July 3. I was awake but sleeping at the same time. I heard a weird kind of choking noise. I thought it was my older brother coming home and crying into my dad's arm. But it was my dad crying. He kept saying he was gone, he was gone and I knew he was talking about my older brother because he never came home. Then my dad came to my room and sat on my bed and said "You know that I love you, don't you?". I just sat there and nodded. Those were the last words he said to me. My dad got up and got dressed. My mom was worried he would do something stupid. He was telling her not to worry. Then the phone rang. It was my brother. My dad went outside to talk to him. He was asking him to come home. Their conversation ended and my dad said he was going out. My mom begged him to stay. He still went, and that was the last time I saw him.  My mom was so scared that she had to call the police and told us to pack our bags. We were going to leave the house that I've been living in for the longest time. Then the police came. They were asking my mom questions and stuff. One of them came up to me and asked me how I was and stuff like that. Then she told us to go downstairs. I didn't know what was going on. My little brother was so upset that he couldn't stop crying. I told him everything would be OK. It was a very long time till anyone got us. It was my older brother who came to get us. I was so glad to see him, but that was my two seconds of happiness. We went into our living room and there were all these people I've never seen before. I went and sat next to my mom. One of the police men kind of looked up and said straight forward "Your dad has passed away." I burst into tears right after he said "away". That was the hardest and longest I've ever cried. I thought that I would never here those words until my dad was really old. But at fifteen years of age, I heard them. I found out that my dad committed suicide; that he threw himself under a moving train. No one told me, so I had to find out from the newspaper. I've never been happy since.   Because of my dads death, we had to deal with his money problem. He was over $10,000 in debt. We had no way of pay this back because we were poor to begin with. So we had to go through this wole legal system to sort it all out. We would constantly get calls everyday and night from credit card companies, wondering where their money is. Now it's been reduced to once every 2 months, or not even. We're still struggling with money, but we're survivng.  So before you think about suicide, or that you hate your parents, or that you have a bad life, think. Don't judge people. Ever since this incident, I had to get counseling. I was known to have depression, and still do. It's no joke, because depression can deprive you of so many things, like my dads life. Because he had depression, he just felt like he couldn't live anymore. It's so hard for me to tell this story because I've never told anyone before, not even my closest friend. I'm trying to choke back tears, but it's to hard. I sometimes think that I should have died instead of him, but I know that I still have friends and family to back me up. So I've told my story, maybe this time you'll understand not to judge and call people names.
