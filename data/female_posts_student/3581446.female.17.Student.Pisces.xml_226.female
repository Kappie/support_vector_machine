Theo:  According to my grandma (who is a devout Catholic) her church has mandated that anyone who votes for Kerry cannot take communion due to his pro-abortion stance  Theo:  Now granted I think abortion is wrong... But to make this all about ONE issue is painfully shortsighted in my opinion  Theo:  Bush has done stuff contrary to catholic doctrine as well... Why don't they pick on folks for voting for him??  Kae:  You know it's things like that, that always turned me away from that particular religion. It is run with so much internal politics that it doesnt even seem like a religion at times. More like a presidential run.   Theo:  Better yet since almost every candidate supports something contrary to catholic doctrine, let's just have NOBODY vote  Theo:  I dunno man  Theo:  It sours me   This really does piss me off. Now granted I accord totally with the church's position that abortion is wrong and a regrettable destruction of human life... And in a sense I don't completely disagree with their moving towards making this a battleground issue and seperating the wheat from the chaff of catholic believers on whether they can tow the line on this issue.   HOWEVER, to make their political involvement so completely focused on one issue will have horrendous consequences, I feel. Yes, stopping or at least curtailing abortion is important. But what about getting us involved in WARS which the pope himself seemed to indicate were wrong? Isn't that important when we're sending grown men to kill and die? Isn't that a sin too?   So why the one-sided focus? Why pick on the sinful policies of one candidate and let those of another slide? You think God plays favorites with some sins over others? Are not the wages of them ALL death?
