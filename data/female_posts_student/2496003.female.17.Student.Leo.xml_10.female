My birthday is coming up ... diamonds are at the top of the list people.      Haha I saw the fattest baby ever today!  Porkchop aka Jeremy is so calm and quiet, but I think it's induced by the fat.  Sweetest little baby ever though.      Sorry this wasn't much people, I'm busy talking to people at the same time and it's hard to do both at the same time.  I love you all though!      Hugs and Many Kisses,   Your Sweetest b.
