The teachers wore 'attractive' costumes and had a so- called 'fashion parade' where teachers would walk in front of the flag pole and do whatever action they wished to... DOWNSIDE: Well, at least we skipped reading period but had to be forced to buy different types of food from the students' stalls. I bought COLD curry puffs and ate Hokkien Mee, like I like it. -_- Anyway, we were able to skip maths (2 PERIODS!!!) as we had to do feedback form and talk about racial harmony day. I certainly agreed to such a session, not because I could skip maths but racial harmony is very important to Singapore, especially our limited resources. We must rely on human resource and social cohesion to prevent fights or riots, thus, celebrating Racial Harmony Day is very very important....
