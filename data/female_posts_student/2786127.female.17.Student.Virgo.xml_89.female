I've played the part of the "i dont care if i have a boyfriend, screw guys" girl, and i'm done with it. Not only with guys but with my friends too I guess. I just miss being wanted, weather it be from a guy or from my friends. I never like when i'm in these moods, nothing good can come from it. Except freaking out...ness. bah.    I'm going to go read harry potter and continue being alone tonight.
