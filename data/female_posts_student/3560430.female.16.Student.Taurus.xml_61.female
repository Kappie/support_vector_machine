She thinks she's better than everybody else becasue she is well travelled, and well versed in many different languages. There was a time when I really comended this person because she was really trying to pick up on Canadian culture and what it is all about. Very good considering she's living in Canada now. But for some reason (actually I think I know the reason) lately she has been playing the part of the superior European girl. It's really frigging annoying. "I just don't get North American humour" or trade the word humour for "expressions". She says this and I know it's not true because she said something of the kind like last month! AUG! Another thing is she continually goes on about how Canadian fashion is just not up to par, how we are insufficiant, so on and so forth, boardering on how we are stupid! she's never acted like this before and I really don't apriciate it. The school system the liturature, nothing is as good as it was in Europe. Well my dear I don't hear you complaining about all the freedom! I know for a fact (because you told me) that elections in your mother contry go a little something like this, your get the list of candidates, you're told which one you will vote for, you vote for that candidate even though they are already in power! But, no that's not why she's here even, she's here becasue at the age of eighteen her brother would have been enlisted in the army. Her paretns not wanting that moved here, to a contry that doesn't do that, that has fair elections, and that has pleanty of *GASP* freedom! What really gets my goat though is the fact that she is only acting liike this becasue a group of people think it's cool to have the tolkine forigner. Some of the people in the group are really nice, very cool people, others... Not so much. One in particulare actually. One that I wouldn't mind telling off one day. of course that is the opne that totally entrances everyone now, becasue she's loud and rude, and as long as that loud rude mouth isn't directing it's coments at you it's "Funny". Not so much. I guess she thinks that this is more European. But if European humour is mean comments made to hurt people I'll stick to my Canadian wit thank you.   Now onto movie talkers.   This may not be as long due to the fact that I'm not as rilled up as I was.   Movie talkers bother me. I hate to say it but it's true. Well no I don't hate to say it. If you are at home watching a movie with people you know and who don't mind that's one thing. In fact I encorage you to make rude guestures at the screen and yell at the charaters to your delight. But when you are in a theater where you have just paid $10.95 to watch a movie that you have been dieing to see, it really sucks when people talk above a whisper. And by whisper I mean face in the person beside you's ear. I went to go see a movie last night (HP3). And it was really good. It would have been better if the little girl on my left wasn't talking like she would at home "What's that""Why's he leaving""Is he a bad guy?". By little girl I don't mean like 3-6 little girl I'm talking at least 8-10. OLD ENOUGH TO SHUT UP! My other grievance was the loud woman beside the Gnome, who was on my right. She was in her late twenties early thirties at least "He's right behind you Harry!" "Watch out!" "That's not how it was in the book." It was a compation to see who I would throttle first.   My mother's a pretty bad movie talker. She has to ask dad what happened a lot either because she's not bright enough to pick it up the first time or because she had to go pee... Again. But that last bit's not her fault she has kidney problems... Still, SIGH.  My Dad can be a bit of an issue as well becasue he's partially deft. Not enough to be legally so, but if there is back round noise he's screwed. They're kind of perfect for each other in that respect. But my parents are qiet movie talkers, they WHISPER. Whispering isn't bad I can put up with it. It's easy to ignore. Heck I can be guilty of whispering, mostly when it's a movie based on a book I've read and liked. But I've yet to blatently just start talking like some beligerant fool who doesn't understand that people PAID to watch the movie that just magically popped up before them.   On the whole though HP3 was a great show.
