So yeah, since then I've written in my personal journal, and listened to my entire Snow Patrol cd (totally worth it, check it out) but after that I got bored so I came downstairs... and here I am now. Lupin the Third is on, and it's fun. So I thought I'd do a real update for once, instead of just a "poem" or being vague. This has been, and I'm almost positive on this one, the best week so far this summer. I've just been so happy, it really feels good. It's kinda funny, I got so little sleep last night, but I feel more awake now then I usually do at 3 pm after a night of peaceful slumber. I'll probably be dead by 3 today, but there's always coffee. I FEEL SO GOOD RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY! Sorry. Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum it's a good day. Today will be good and tomorrow will be good and friday will be too and saturday is just going to rock because it's both Tracy's and Ian's birthday! Hoorah!! Ok, that's enough senseless, sleep-deprived ramblings on for now. But I'll be back!   BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
