Basically it goes like:  There was a Prince, and the prince was very bad. but because he was the prince, he could not be punished. So a servant boy was selected to be whipped in place of the prince to make the prince feel guilty.. only he never did.   There was more to it, but that is the main part. I feel like that kid - alot. More than I should.  I figured out how I feel here in this town.  I feel like the Clark Kent/ Whipping Boy. Basically, overall I'm a good person... I do my own thing, work on my own stuff. However, when something bad goes wrong, I either go into Superman mode (mainly counseling) or Whipping Boy mode (taking the fall). I always seem to get the negative end. I'm rather ready for someone to stand and say "Chillout", Liz is cool - she's done nothing.  I'm tired. I'm stressed. On top of that I'm moving (somewhere) and I know that I'm about to be separated from many of my friends. I really can not deal with any more problems. My house is a mess and I have finals. My family is breathing down my neck about school and finding a job. My phone has been ringing off the hook with problems that must be solved or at least controlled. Friends are betraying friends, people are being hurt. All I want is for individuals to stop hurting "friends". Its stupid. Its painful. The wounds can last a very long time.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I heard something interesting today. CNN proclaimed  "2004: The Year of the Blog" . No kidding. When I started at the new year, I had a website,  Debbie  had a website, and  Rick  had one. Now I have over 30 friends that maintain them. Some are better than others when it comes to keeping them updated. Debbie is probably the best. I won't head in the other direction. I enjoy reading these websites.  Scott  said "I've gotten to know a new side of you" (or something along those lines). That has been my goal. I feel that I open up through writing. It is fairly hard for me to open up vocally. I wish I could, but it rarely happens.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I'm rather bummed out about the Foreign Service. I know that I was more than ready for a response, but the response was not what I wanted. It was just one more thing in the many that happened this week. I had worked so hard for it. I studied so much, read so much, I even watched TV specials on places like Tibet. Thing is, I enjoy that so much. To me, an thourough understanding of International Studies and Cultures give so much insight into life. When I think things can't get worse, I just open up one of my world conflict books. It is at that point I feel like I have no room to complain.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Things Never Said by VSU students   10. Oh I just couldn't. Hell, she's only a freshman. 9.
