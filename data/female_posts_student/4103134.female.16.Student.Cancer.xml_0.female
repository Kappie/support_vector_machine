Isabel, she was supposed to be my  best friend,  has finally her first boyfriend. I feel happy for her, really, but I don't understand why she tells her boyfriend secrets and lies about me?! I guess she does because she's afraid that her boyfriend  Johannes  could like me more than her.... I mean - would  I  be a good friend if I took away her boyfriend?! And though  Johannes  doesn't know me, he takes my name in vain. By this behaviour I can see that he's still not mature enough, although he is 21.... +laugh+      Yesterday at a beachparty a young man (26, I dunno his name) talked to me. Well, he was a bit drunken... He asked me if I'm a single-child and I said "yes". He then answered that I seem to be snooty and selfish. I didn't show an interest in that in front of him. But secretly I'm wondering if he's right. Well, I have to admit that I'm regaled, yes... but it's not that pernicious, I know there are people that really get everything what they want and that's not(?) the case with me...      Am I really arrogant or s.th.? But when I'm really that snooty, that selfish, that arrogant - why do I have then that much friends? Are they my friends anyway? Am I thinking too much? o.O   Maybe he's right and that's the reason why I now haven't got a boyfriend.....?   I want to fall in love....    urlLink http://www.getpics.de/liebe/1.gif   kay, bye 4 now.....
