She's all talk; she'd never hurt a flea, but nobody's supposed to know that.  She's not too fond of Rosie at times, but she loves her really deep down.  Once again, she never carries out her threats.  She never gets in fights with Josh or Will though. I wonder why that is... I'm just kidding, Z, calm down.  Anyway, I'll see yall later.
