I made a cute video for Brandon yesterday...nearly made me and mum cry, cos we had 'Flying Without Wings' in the background, I gave it to Debbie and Gavin, they seemed to like it.  What else? Oh yes. Should be going to Flamingo Land in the hols! That oughta be fun!  That's it now. I should update here more often, hehe.
