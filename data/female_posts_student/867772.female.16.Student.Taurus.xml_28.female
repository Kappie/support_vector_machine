But is it a sin to try to get there? People are kind of like....buildings or something (I'm talking spiritually here, not writing the script for Invasion of the Fat People). We build ourselves. We take ideas from....just about everything that happens to pass into our little brains and is lucky enough not to fall out the other side. We use these ideas and, basically, build ourselves. From the qualities we already have, that we're constantly striving to improve, to the qualities we don't have, and are desperately trying to attain. We become these collages of shit. Good shit, bad shit, that's for you to decide. The final product is pretty much the person we accept as someone we want to be.   I guess this much thought isn't put into the process, it just kinda happens. But I'm a little obsessive compulsive when it comes to analyzing things.
