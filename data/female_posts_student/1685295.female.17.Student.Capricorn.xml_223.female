Not really hungry though, about to sleep felt that  I had to rant or do something before my system gave up. Dollface, so you saw the Return of the King (not going to bother with the link cause everyone know what it is). How was it? Umm....How is that Harmonica thing going?  There once was a man named Steve Steve did what he wanted When he pleased Why sometimes he peed in the street  All was good for Steve Everything was sunny and free Until he pissed off this bulldog And it bit off his knees Now Steve can't get out his chair He finds it hard to get up and down stairs The funny thing is that no one cares.  Steve no longer takes strolls or saunters in the park or piss in the places that are dark Now he just sits in his chair Trying to reach for the pretty nurse's hair  Now Steve can't piss in streets Or any other place that he sees Poor Steve, Poor Steve Stuck in a chair Too bad nobody really cares.
