Make coffee and mop the floor I do the housework mom tells me to do And I'll remember to lock the front door  Or I could fold a heart for you Sit with you side but side Look out from the bus window and wonder if i had anything to hide  Or i could watch another movie with my best friend And laugh because we're bimbos We could never find any more movies to rent If we had already watched all the shows  Or I can cry and look back being a rotten girl And tell you sorry over the phone Sorry I failed you and make you upset Sorry I had to make you feel so alone  Maybe if could control my mind Things weren't be so bad Maybe if i was a little sensible back then I would'nt keep on feeling sad  Maybe if you didn't meet me Things weren't be so bad Maybe if didn't talk to each other i wouldn't keep on feeling sad  But to think again,maybe if we didn't know each other I'll never learn to love or to miss someone  I couldn't get any further If I didn't think that you were the one     Written by Drifting Heart    *Me and my guitar are one* *Me and my guitar are one in eternity*
