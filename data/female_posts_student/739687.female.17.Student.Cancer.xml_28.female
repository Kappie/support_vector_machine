Almost like a stage-fright sort of thing...only not. So much has been running through my mind all day and I'm like "Oh..I'll write about that in my blog." But of course...what do I do? I forget everything that i was previously thinking about. Blogger, you cursed beast you! Heh, anyways...I have the urge to go shopping, but I'm really trying to save up my money...not blow it all. Right, because  I  could really do  that!  It's doubtful. You know...sometimes I wish I was a more personable person. I'm gonna work on that though...something to accomplish before school starts. Speaking of which...may I remind you all we only have two more weeks. Yes. It's very depressing. Another thought: I've realized over the past several years that I seem to have a good understand for most people. I can relate, and sort of see peoples' opinions. I suppose that's a good thing...but it makes it hard for me to debate alot of subject matter, because I can see both sides of the argument, and I'm not always sure where I stand. Bringing me to another point: I wish I could be more firm and decisive in my opinions. I'm a very opinionated person, unfortunately, I often represent contradicting opinions. Does that make me fake or something, or understanding, or just plain confused?  Well, I think I will call it a night pretty soon...I woke up too early this morning...Farewell for now!
