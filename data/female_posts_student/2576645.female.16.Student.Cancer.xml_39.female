Laura....must you go to Chicago and leave me stranded here?   Ever since I went there in February and changed planes at Midway Airport over spring break, I have had a longing to go there.   On the subject of the Windy City: Bill won The Apprentice, and he now gets to build a huge hotel for Donald Trump there.   Another one of my mother's conspiracy theories: Amorossa sabotaged Kwame so he would lose.  I think I am the only one of my friends to watch that show.  But thats cool.....I can rant and rave about it while everyone wonders what I am talking about.  Everyone needs a person like that.......     and guess what guys!     Thats me.
