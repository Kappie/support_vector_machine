It is either the projects I am working on today or the Vicodin I am taking for my broken back that is making time last forever. I am taking a moment away from ID TheftBlock and other tasks at work to breathe. I thought I would invite you to join me.   A few friends have asked to be updated on the accident and the resulting wave of whatever it has created. To sum things up...the car will be paid off by the insurance and I am still unsure if there will be any leftover for a down payment on something new. I have also yet to be told I am no longer allowed to drive a vehicle in the great state of California. I thought at first they may not let me, but as of right now the only thing I am waiting for is the okay from my physician and the confidence that I will no longer be in the propensity to black out while driving. Yes, this was the second time it has happened, the first time being about two years ago. I was told it wouldnï¿½t happen again, but alas, it has. I thank God my liver survived in its whole and that there were no horses involved this time around.  If anyone knows of a good dealership or contact through which I can find a great deal on a newer vehicle, please let me know. I make enough money to handle a car payment and the astronomical insurance payment that is bound to result from this mess, so let me know if anyone has any options for me.
