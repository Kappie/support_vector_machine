Hah... Honestly, I don't think I'm cut out for that genre, the last thing I wrote was a not-so-short short story about a teenage girl in a very strange sexual relationship with a teacher. It's actually pretty good, if rather graphic. Several people really liked it though. Anyway, back to my children's book, the storyboard is coming along well but I still don't like it. Well, we'll see.  Steph and I skipped Tech today, she dragged me out into the hallway and she looked absolutely frightened. She handed me a note and told me to read it, I could definitely understand her fear. The note was from some guy who apparently took one of her jokes to far, he was going to attack her family. It got a whole lot worse after that but, I'd rather not get into it. Later Steph told me the other reason she needed to talk to me. She's bribing me to come with her to some drug party, her ex-boyfriend is going to be there and she needs me for emotional support. On the plus side, she's buying for me that night. I may go, or not. I have enough of my own problems, I don't need hers too.  Why do pretty guys always have to have personalities that suck major fundement? There's this uber-gorgeous guy at school that I've been staring at for months now, I haven't spoken to him much but he really comes off as a jackarse. Oddly enough, I was walking around a corner today and nearly slammed into him. I think I scare him, but I do run into him really often. Bah, he's too pretty...
