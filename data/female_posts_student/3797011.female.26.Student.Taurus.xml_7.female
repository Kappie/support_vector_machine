One by one i read it  and suddenly tears is out from my eyes The pain is hit me and cut my heart like a thousand knifes  I though that it has cure but i am wrong Reading your old email seem like open the memories The memories that i want to leave behind  But the heart is remember Remember the hurt Remember the tears Remember the suffer that even you can't imagine it that you will never understand  I never though that the memories is capture deep inside my heart and it can't be erased even to be cured coz the pain is too deep so much deep  I don't know what should i do now... I ask the wind I ask the stars I ask the moon But they just silent And drown me in this pain and tears....    ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
