I'm behind on reading, laundry and cleaning, but I had a lot of fun hanging out in costume all of Saturday and Sunday. Jerm and I got up to Camp Tamaracho at dusk, set up camp in the dark, then drove down the hill to get fast food. I always forget how cold it is to camp in modern clothes! My wool dress, gollar and cloak are much warmer than my blue jeans and a jacket, oddly enough--the skirt of the dress does a lot to keep my legs and backside warm! I probably drank too much, but it was fun, despite the Sunday morning hangover. I got up just in time for lunch. Eek.  Then on Monday, Jerm and I went up to Monte Vista to help his folks finish staging the house for all of the realtors coming through today. I cleaned a bunch of construction dust and carpet bits off of a lot of things. Hard work, but very satisfying. I could really see what I was accomplishing. Since I stayed so late finishing up, I cut class this morning, but made it to my afternoon class. I went to the drug store and spent the rest of my birthday money on frivolous things, like hair dye and this cool kohl powder eyeliner, among other things. Kind of a dull post, but I'm feeling a bit lethargic today.
