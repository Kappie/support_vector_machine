I only need two mornings a week, I certainly don't want him there all day, and I absolutely couldn't afford it anyway. It was all irrelevant, however, as Gavin does not turn 2 before September 1st, and couldn't be admitted, anyway. I crumpled up the letter and decided to move to Finland.  My mother went to the dump with the crap from the back of the truck, in an effort to get the truck ready to ditch/sell/roll into the ravine. I gave up and plopped Gavin in front of Blue's Clues while I made dinner. The heat was intense, despite the smattering of rain that failed to darken the sky. Just as I flicked off the stove and called Mike down to dinner, the power went out.  Mike wailed upstairs. His unsaved hour at work was wasted in a blink. He trudged downstairs, defeated. I dished him up a plate of beef thai curry, and we sat to dinner. Outside, the obnoxious children screamed and cried about the power. I expect their video games crapped out. They flooded into the parking lot to wreak havok as orcs and shield maidens.  My mother came home to the powerless house, and we laughed a tired laugh and salvaged the beer and ice cream from the dark fridge. Mike picked up the bagpipe chanter and began his first lesson. To our astonishment, he took to it. He loved it. He worked through the lesson book, intensely interested and encouraged. Gavin danced. It's just like Mike to excel at unusual things. First the scottish dancing, then the highland, now bagpipes. This man is a Scot, through and through.  When the power came on, I cried out in joy and danced a happy dance. At that moment, the cd player kicked on behind me and unexpectedly emitted a loud, soaring, victorious chorus that echoed my enthused bouncing and sent my mother and Mike into roars of laughter. Gavin clapped and danced along.  The truck is dead, the trees are doomed, and the milk is warm, but we have music, love, and laughter (and leftover curry!) so all is right in the world.
