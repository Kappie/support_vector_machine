I have been doing it for a while but once it's done it's done, and once I know the material it is locked into this head of mine.  Once I get that out of the way I get to go shopping and to the movies tommorow.  Then we are gonna watch the Grey Cup tommorow.  Anyways - lotsa stuyding ahead!  Oh and I found this funand interesting thing...It was this thing to determine which Finding Nemo character you are most like!!!  LOL.
