Stupid rit? maybe its not the coffee.. guess i'm juz thinkin alot. Its funny how God changes people. I only noticed how much i've changed 2dae.. It was the talk with egan that kind of make me feel shocked by myself. Never knew i had changed and learnt so much. Guess this is the reason why i've been thinkin so much nowadaes? Really pray that God will come through for all of us bah.  - *with his love* -
