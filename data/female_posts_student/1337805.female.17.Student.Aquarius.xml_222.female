I think the only other people who were better, out of all the guys I've even just made out with, were maybe Will and Kelty. So that's pretty good.  Yeah, Nick? You're an amazing kisser. :p Don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise. I love it.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tuesday, April 06, 2004   Wow.  I realized how incredibly mushy this blog has gotten, because it is my hidden blog. Ooooh boy :).   Anyways. Yesterday was pretty crappy. I found out that Nick had actaully gone and read my blog, not that I cared, but he found out some stuff that I wasn't gonig to tell him for a whiiiiile..so..oops. He was teasing me about it, and was all silent and junk later...Kinda worried that I had fucked it all up like I usually do. I was so upset. When you like, or even love someone that much, to lose it all...Not fun.  Then I ruined my fave pair of jeans, a butterfly clip, and twisted my ankle. Blarch. Steve sent me an email though that boosted my mood..I was going into dark places.  Today was pretty shitty too. We did a practice test in Math, and I got so confused and messed up...I'm not really looking forward to the test. Earth Science was just plain boring, Steve got sooo amd at me in English, then decided I didn't need the hug he promised me, (which I did.) and gave me the coldest look I've ever seen. I skipped block 4 with Nick. I thought that would be terribly awkward, but it realy wasn't. We talked, and laughed, and kissed a bit...then he was teasing me over the whole "I love you!" thing. Then he told me he loved me. And that I was like, the most beautiful girl...A bunch of sweet stuff. It was touching. :) It completely made my day.  Then I came back after school, and Laura hid a beaaautiful collage in my locker she had made me :) It had pictures of me and her and some other stuff on it. It was pretty. It was a good day.   :)   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Sunday, April 04, 2004   Oh yeah, Calvyn asked out Kim on Friday. Only for a day, to stop me from telling them they should go out. And they kissed goodbye. Cuuuuuutest thing I've ever seen, unless I had a mirror to see me and Nick kiss :P I hope they go out for longer tho.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Should start going to class.  I'm failing Multimedia, done nothing about that. In fact, went to about 3 classes before started skipping again. Missed 3 math classes of a 4 day week. Missed 1 english class. Missed 2 Multimedia. It's not my fault the sun started shining. It got warm too, around the 20's each day. Gorgeous. I wore a skirt, without pants or anything else, for the first time in about 2 years. To school too, which was amazing.  Block four on Friday was amazing too. Skipped with Kim, Calvyn, and Nicky, went and sat out on the hill. im and Calvyn did math, they looked so cute together, I kept bugging them about it. Nick and me cuddled, and kissed, the first time in several days. I loved it. He said I was beautiful, and put flowers in my hair, to make me even prettier. Twas fun. Went to First aid, that was alright. Went to youth, got sick mid way. It was fun playing football in a skirt and flipflops tho. Can't wait to do that again.   Next weekend is easter weekend, and I beleive everyone is gonan go camp out in Laura's backyard, which will be exciting. Saturday also marks a very important date in which I believe not being around Laura and everyone is important. It's my one month anniversary celebration on the 10th, so yay us :). Beeming with pride.  In addition, I found out that I was tragically the only person gonig to Canuudle this year from Victoria. Even though this deeply saddens me, it means I get more money from the youth fund, like at least $100. I'm gonna try and hit Mike up for more, like somewhere around $200. That would help hugely. I get to go to Calgary too, and see San and Erin and everyone else there and drive up with them, so I'm extremely excited and happy about that. The band trip is coming up, taking away Nicky, Matt, Steve, Sean, Laura and Misha, and then Laura's going to Edmonton the next weekend. Tragic.   Other than that I got a paint set in my kinder egg. Pretty freaking awesome. And I'm going hot tubbing tomorw.     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Friday, March 26, 2004   Today sucked.  Skipped block one, totally forgot I had to hand in something for math. Went to a performance instead with Laura and Kim, and although it was fun, I would have rather have been hanging out with my boyfriend, and Tom..Cause I never get to hang out with Tom.   Earth Science was alright. As was Lunch. English wasn't that bad either.  Went to Multimedia, late. Mr Ollis yelled at me for skipping yesterday. Started working on my english, and he told me that right now, I was gonig to fail, because I have only handed in a small five mark project, and my work ethic sucks. So now i'm working frantically to hand in my website project, and maaaybe my digital photography unit (if Nick helps me). End of term 3 is in like, two weeks, so I need to work HARD.   Plus, if Mom sees the amount of absences on my report card...things will fly.  After school, I missed my bus, so I went to Laura's after school, cause Nick had to work.  Then Steve got mad at me for telling him not to say the word "gay" as stupid. And my mom has been yelling and snapping at me for anything the past few days.  Life really blows today. I hope it gets better soon.  I want to be alone with Nick.
