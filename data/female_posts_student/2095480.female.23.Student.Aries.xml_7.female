What I am doing is trying to get a degree, any degree at this point it seems. Actually, the interdisciplinary degree is perfect for me. COMM, MUSC, and POLI. My top three interests... but the thing is I've gone into this mode of slack for some reason. Its midterm and I am finding myself leaving my backpack in the car overnight... not true with German though, I am studying that, but I didnt do so well on that test... what if I fail? That would mean taking only 3 hours in the fall... I cannot allow for that, yet here I am worrying about everything else.  Where I am going... I am going where the wind blows me right now... What I really need to do is take my life by the horns and steer it where I want to go... thing is, all of a sudden, now that I can see myself leaving Valdosta, I am scared. Where am I going? Who will be there? What will I be doing? Now, just like I was as a high school senior, I am completely open to ideas. Maybe I should have explored more options at that point. Maybe I should explore more options at this point, not to mention the time I've wasted the past 4 years...   Who am I? I am a person that loves excitement, a person that loves nothing more than being with close friends, a person that is smart when it comes to projects that I have an interest in yet a total slack when its something that is required of me, a person that loves to listen to others speak - and then I contemplate those comments, I am a person that would rather spend a quiet evening with friends than go to a block party - yet I also love those too, I am a person that loves to read, yet it drives me nuts, I love to work, I love to work with my hands, I like making things, I love to make and listen to music, I despise long hours on the phone, particularly with someone that lives across town - I'll drive over and chat in person, yet I will spend hours upon hours on the phone with friends/family that are no where nearby, I am a person that hates to be alone - but I realize that being alone is better than being with the wrong person - wonder where I learned that... I am a person that loves to be held, I am the person the can not stand to be blown off, taken advantage of, or even ignored. I am annoyed by slow drivers, bad computers, people that talk about me in a negative way, I am annoyed by the loud bass that makes cars rattle on the outside, and by red lights that take too long to change, I am annoyed by people that keep their cell phones on during "events" and when hanging out w/ friends, by this I mean, enjoy what you are doing in the moment, live the moment. I am annoyed by people that try to live the lives of others via gossip, (MIRANDA knows who I am referring too!), I am a person that cannot be defined by one word, although, I would love to know what my friends would say if asked what one word they would say to describe me...  Had dinner with Miranda, Rick, Ken, Robert, and Patrick tonight... Rick said something that I really liked. "I have wondered what it would be like for my social circles to mix, and now that its happening I don't think I like it." I have several social circles.  FIRST , the Music crowd. Which is divided into two groups that blend, the party crowd and the friend crowd.  SECOND , SAI. I sorta consider this a separate group.  THIRD , Alpha Gamma Delta. However, I have really changed since I joined them....  FOURTH , the Student Christian Center. I go Wed. nights for an hour for a Bible study. I'm not a Bible beater, but as I said, I like discussion, and it provides.  FIFTH , international programs.  SIXTH , VSO admin,  SEVENTH , Griffin friends. I do wonder what would happen if those crossed. Of all these however, I think I have 5 or 6 REALLY good friends... thanks guys!  Okay... I guess that's it for right now... I know I'm not done... but its late.
