As time progressed, humans worked toward making everything faster, more efficient. So our train starts speeding right along. Faster, faster, faster. When a hundred years ago a person would've looked out of their train window and seen the beautiful landscape, having time to notice each detail, our modern passengers see the world only in a blur, noticing and therefore caring about nothing important. Faster, faster, faster.  And you know what happens when a train starts going too fast?   It crashes.
