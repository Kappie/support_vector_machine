I've had way too much stress lately and lack of sleep made it even worse. i am also to say that everytime i said what day of the week it was i was always wrong. i think that's a major sign of sleep deprivation.ce la vie...it's not just a B*witched song kiddos.   my week consisted of art foes and presentation shit. it all kind of piled on me which was horrible. i finished my fountain yesterday with bitterness. i'm so sick of it and then Mr Namgets started to actually give me advice at the last minute and it made me really annoyed. grrr...he wonders why i never ask him questions. who cares. so in total i spent 10 hrs in the art room this week and still had to scramble to get done yesterday by 4:45. i have a feeling i won't like it when it comes out of the kiln...if it makes it through the kiln. *shudder*  my presentation didn't go to bad. i had to come in early to school quite a lot because of making a power point show but it paid off. i'm really sick of anything to do with Alcatraz. whether it be the island, the prison, the prisoners, the escapes, even the temperature. i had major relief when i went to return the Alcatraz library books. haha i spit at you!  what else have i been up to. well i had a terrible orchestra-brass concert on monday. i don't want to do that again. i had a really good children's choir concert on tuesday. i watched Big Fish in english. i thoroughly enjoyed no matter what other people say. i don't understand how you can't understand that movie. it had a moving plot and it wasn't strange just clever. tim burton's a genius damn it.  yesterday i had a lovely outting with Ambroscious (who will now be dubbed Tabitha) and  Lily and her sis, Mona. We went to Guh Funk and had italian sodas and the usual espressos at the Urb. yay i love it there. We also went to the neighboring "parks" and took some fun pictures. I also found shoes on a telephone wire. yay! there were some cool staircases and a rivendell type sculpture gazebo. it was a good excursion and a good getaway all at the same time.  i had a weird beyond weird dream last night. but that's all i shall state.
