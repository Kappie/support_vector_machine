Beth stayed over afterwards. It was nice because I won't see her again until August (how disgusting!) We spent most of the night talking about just stuff, mostly friend stuff. Sometimes talking about friend stuff gets depressing. You wouldn't think it but it does. *SIGH*. I think I got a mosquito bite under my left breast, that is the wierdest place to get one ever! And it is really itchy.         Tomorrow I'm off and laughing on a fast camel. Ah George. I'm going to Calgary, as I've mentioned before, and plan on getting lots of reading and relaxing done, but not before the initial "Oh my god the house is a mess and I don't want to come home to a mess!" freak out that I know mom will have. The funny thing is she probably will come home to a mess because the Gnome and his 'friend' are staying here while we are out. They are not very clean. My mother is going to cry when she gets home.         Well I feel the book calling me so I must be off. Ciao.
