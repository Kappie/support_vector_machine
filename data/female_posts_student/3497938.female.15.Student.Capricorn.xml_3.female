Me and Kayla dont have any drama goin on. (which im thankful about) It's all good. Today im going to the movies with my grandma (haha, sounds so corny) to see Shrek 2. We dont get to spend quality time together, so I promised her that I would go with her. I have started talking to Kyle lately, and I used to hate him. But he is ok now. I guess I never really gave him a chance. *lol, sorry kyle* So yeah, i think its about time to start getting ready. I'll post later on tonight.
