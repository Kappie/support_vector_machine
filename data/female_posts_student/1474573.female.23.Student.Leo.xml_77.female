I sound like a fog horn and it seems like this ebol like cold is "going around." Colds are like my period, when I have it everyone else seems to have it too. So what is special  about today? I'm on my way to poetry class and I'm about to get one of my "slam" poems workshopped, I wonder how that will go. I volunteered to get the Rikers site at   urlLink CWP  I hope I get it. All of this year and next years research is based on it. I  don't know why I want to work in the prison industry....actually that's a lie , I know exactly why I want to work there, I'm just a little apprehensive. I keep getting speeches from friends and parents asking me if i'm crazy........maybe... speaking of callings Joan of Arcadia is going to premiere this friday? I wonder if it will be any good   film at 11  diane
