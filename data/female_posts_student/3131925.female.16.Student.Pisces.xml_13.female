Really glad schools over cause I've been able to see him a lot more than just lunch and passing period or w/e. On friday we decided to go to the youth's all nighter thing. We saw dodgeball which was like sold out so there's me and Clint's sittings in the very front row lol...of course with Katie in the back calling me lol. It was a ok movie. Jessie, Allen, Bean and Melanie all saw shrek 2 which of course started once our movie ended so me and Clint walked around and went behind coldstone's and talked and played go fish cause i suck at cards and don't know how to play any games. Then Ashley Franklin called, after all the drama with her sneaking out her mom made her try living with her day in San Diego (and she's not even next to sea world how lame). So we finally get back to St. John's and it's sucking..really bad. All little people except for our lil group. Clint didnt bring a blanket or anything so it's my blanket that fits one person over both of us and a bunch of little kids screaming at like 4 in the morning, so Clint mentions beans car..we get our shit and go out and everyone assumes clint's gonna get ass in that P.o.s. lol i'll spare you details lol BUT HE DIDNT..now grandparents are gone and i can finally go out, party, hang out with anyone i want all i want.
