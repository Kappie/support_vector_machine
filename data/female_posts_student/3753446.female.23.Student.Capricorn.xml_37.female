The contest was to design and program a robot to pick up and carry three eggs across a room and put them in a basket without breaking them, in the shortest amount of time.   I am PROUD TO SAY, the high schooler that showed them how its done was none other than my very own 17 yr old sister, and future engineer elite, Leena Saklayen. She may not know how to drive a car from the grocery store back to her house, but dammit she can build you a robot!  Given this scenario, I, as a graduate student, would move back to Bangladesh and "breed and feed" mini Bengalis for the rest of my life if a 17 year old had to show me how to dissect a brain out of a rat in 30 seconds or less. C'mon little snots... bring it.
