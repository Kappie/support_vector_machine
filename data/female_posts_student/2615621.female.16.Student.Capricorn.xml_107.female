He's "talking" to someone..but u know ive talked to people and not dated them...so maybe he wont date her. but even if she does, then they wont date forever..and he'll know me..and maybe after her..or whatever. who knows. anyways, on my list i had blue eyes and bay told me he had brown eyes so i made that expection haha but come to find out, he does have blue eyes. I swear, the better he gets and sounds the farther away he is from my reach. Does that make sense? Well, this is what was said:  Joe: hey, me and bay got this friend who wants to date a skater and his name needs to be danny!! Danny: *big smile* haha thats the sweetest   OKAY..now danny baby, think about it..someone who doesnt know u and ur their "mr perfect" come on!! thats more than sweet!! thats meant to be dammit. lol  So bay is gonna go wednesday and just tell him the whole damn story about the list and about how we're perfect for each other and everything. Maybe he'll listen. Bay is really upset, she says she isnt..but i know she is. Her boyfriend has this major thing for me. She was given a Louis Vuttion purse for her grad. present and i got one for christmas and her bf didnt say "oo thats cool" or "wow!" but the first thing outta his mouth was "omg! julia has one of those!! hers is soo awesome!" i mean..those were his words. What a bitch. COME ON JOE!! ur suppose to be hookin me up with ur friend!! Bay said shes not mad and shes ok, but that her bf is like obessed with me. Hes always bringing me up and stuff, makes me feel bad actually. But then again, it does give bay more will to get me taken by danny haha and joe prob cant say enough good things..so thats good. lol Oh and i hear danny has straight white teeth and a pretty smile...that was on the list. dammit. Bay told me she wish something like this would happen to her where her "mr perfect" was a real live walking person. Yeah...he may be my peuguin (they search and search until they find those one other special peuguin and they stay with just that one forever) but who is to say im his? u would think it would all work out, u know, ur soulmate is one person and that same persons soulmate is u. Maybe it works that way, and maybe hes just gotta find that out. haha but hes perfect..i couldnt ask for more.   Something funny kinda happened today with danny too. I was telling ashley about how people at my dads church jump around and dance and stuff. Well, ironically, danny goes to the same type of church with joe and bay and i asked bay how church was and if it was loud or whatever, and of course it is. and she informs me, 2 seconds after i told ash that "i bet he doesnt dance..i mean..come on...", bay tells me that danny dances in church and how funny and awesome it is cuz he taps his foot and claps lol. HAHA..right after i tell ash i hope he doesnt. haha but oh well, i then found out he goes to church by himself, that has to say a lot about him. Hes dedicated. Maybe God tell him that hes meant for me :D haha Idk..but bay has one of those prayer box necklaces and she wrote on the paper "julia and danny together" and stuck it in her prayer box. She loves that thing. Everything she's every put in there has happened. She told me she'd get me one for a get well gift after my surgery. AWWW lol anyways, ashley is lighting a candle for me too!! hahaha i really want this in my life, i want a guy who is like my list..and here he is. right there. the more and more perfect for me he is the harder he is to get. I told ashley about bay's prayer box and called it her "holy 8-ball" haha i found it funny.   I guess i'll eat a few more bites of my cheddar cheese chex mix and flavored sparkling water beverage and then go to bed..it is only after 3am...
