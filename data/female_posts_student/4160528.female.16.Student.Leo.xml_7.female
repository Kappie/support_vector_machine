I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say.Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't. ou can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own........when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.  But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.  Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.  Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could have had.  * What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say good-bye?  *What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there?  *What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? (even if it is that you don't care anymore)  *What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them?  *What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all of my family and they know I love them?*  I need a real man who kno how 2 treat a ladii .. the type who dont act shadii and wen his boyz ask he says .. yea dat my babii  I waS thE 1 He GaVe ThE StReEt LyFe Up Fo,Who MaDe HiM hAnG HiS jErSEe On Da BAck OF tHa dO', ANd saYd" fuCk IT i dONt waNNa bE a PLaYA nO mO"  I  Be ThA GuRl He CaLL hIs BaBy..

You want to believe him when he says that you'll still be friends.  You know you'll get over him within time.... But you'll never forget his touch, or his smile. Even more, when he wiped that last tear away from your eye and said... "You're still beautiful when you cry"  *º.º iM eVeRy THuGZ PaSSioN 'N i PiMP DeM VeRY WeLL  º.º      1m 3vErY hO3z nit3mArE.. i 1ntr0dUc3d thEm tA h3ll       º.º 1m ThE p1mPsTr3sS oF d1zZ nAuGhTy NaTiOn º.º       PlAy1n DeM PiMpZz Fo Mah SatYsFaCtIoN       º.º MaKiN DeM FeeL aLL THoZe SeXy SeNSaTioNZ º.º     WHiLe THeY BReATHe My ViBRaTioNZ º.º i BeCoMe THeiR iNSPiRaTioN º.º        ThEn ThEy FaLl To 1nFaCtUaTiOn  ***i*v sEeN so MaNy GuYZ* BuT boI i ThInK uR it*U GOT ME dRaWInG hEaRtZ ROuNd uR nAmE n shYt* tHA WaY u TalK * Tha WaY smElL* I nEvER tHoUgHt I*D bE TRiPpIn Ova U * BUt DaMn.. i Fell*  *LiL BiTcHe$ TaLkiN sHyTt LyK tHeY kNo MeE . . pLeAs$e iF i HaDda DlK . . uDd BeE tHa FiRsTt Ta bLoW mE  wHeN yOu sTaRt tO miisS mE. . mEmbEr      yOu`rE tHa wUn whO lEt mE gO. .  *.. iT's HaRd To SmiLe WhEn YoUr HaPpInEsS iS aLl LiEs AnD yOu HaVe TeArS iN yOuR eYeS..*..    ~...~I'vE dOnE sOmE sTuPiD sHiT, i'Ve EvEn LiEd To YoU...yOu KnO tHaT fOr A fAcT...pLuS aLl  I'vE pUt YoU tHrOuGh...It StiLL aMaZeS mE, hOw YoU'vE fOrGiVeN mE, If I cOuLd TaKe It BaCk...I wOuLdN't HaVe DoNe ThoSe StUpId ThInGs~...~  ***Give me a kiss, give me the world, give me your heart, i'll be your girl, give me your smile, give me your time, give me your love, i'll give you mine***  I am wh0 I am      -->thats a|| I wanna be*s0 d0n't even think about* . .L a b e l i n g .

And someone asked if I knew you. Looking away, I thought of all the time we had together; sharing, laughter, tears, jokes, and tons more. And then without explanation you were gone. I looked to where they were waiting for an answer, and then said softly, "Once...I thought I did.*  there is always that one boy that no matter what he does or how bad he hurts you, you cant let him go..
