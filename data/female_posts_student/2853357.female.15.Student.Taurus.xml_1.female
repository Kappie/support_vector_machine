O.O"   now, tell me THATS pathetic.  mom and dad are coming back from las vegas today. b l a h . . . its much more fun to have the house to myself [of course, i couldnt be without my brother...] but moms surprisingly becoming more trusting... strange, but true...  lucky gina gets to be in las vegs all week because shes done with school... and so is davy... DAMN YOU PRIVATE SCHOOL KIDS! U SUCK! ^.^   haha, i think i'll go kick ryan awake now XD!  •patty•  p.s. going to LAS VEGAS after finals to hang out with my favorite cousin!   IN A REALLY BIG HOTEL!
