Ms Poh's lesson was so much better than the previous one..haha i think she was rather pissed tt day. She kept picking on houshun. i think we're somehow in thw wrong as well cos..frankly speaking i dun think many of us read the econs lecture notes before attending her class. haha..but we did learn quite alot tt day and i finally know how to draw the supernormal,normal and subnormal curves for monopoly. haha...i think those graphs will stay with me for some time.=) btw, am i realy like a kid? i seriously dun think so. but pple in my class dun seem to know me well enough. forgivable la cos we've only known each other for less than half a year. i admit i can be childish at times but i do have my mature sides as well. =) gota complete my yu wen lian xi tonight or else i wun be able to hand it in tml. and i dun want to hand in late work cos it'll leave a bad impression. oh ya i've got 19hrs for CIP this term...=)=)  i am beginning to get sick of CCS but i dun think i can quit as i only havemy LEP club and CCS to rely on liao or i wun have PEARLS points. sigh~ it's miserable..thinking of joing another cca which doesn't require tt much time but dunnoe wad to join leh.i'll end here...bye =)
