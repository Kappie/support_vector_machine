This goes on for five minutes and I'm like wtf, so I close the window to make it go away. But I accidentally closed the thing in the window!  It's dark out and of course once again, late, so I say f-it and just go to sleep.  In the morning I still hear the thing every now and then buzzing it's wings.  So I open the window and there it is in the daylight, a huge locus.  Gross right, and now I feel bad because if I haden't locked it in there then the small spider and it's web wouldn't have gotten it.  By mornign it was making it's last cries for help, and I tried to help but it was to late, I had already sealed it's fate. Sad, but what does that say about life?   Personal:  Today was pretty shitty. It started pouring on my way back and the umbrella I had must have been to small, I was soaked from my knees down.  Stupid slanty rian. And then Russ and I decided to cancell due to the crappy weather, so I went out and did errands instead!  Also met up with Dave later on.  We went to Montclair's Eclectic Cafe, I haven't been there in atleast a year.  It was cool except for the annoying teens, waited a half hour to get seated and it was kareoke night, except these people were SOBER!  One guy started singing to friggin System of a Down, I was like wow, thats pathetic and sad all at once.  But I had really good coffee and gelato, and of course interesting catch up converstion with Dave.  Haven't really seen him since he got home from Europe, and by haven't really seen I mean at all. Called Ross when I got back (and I wanted to go to bed early!).  Trying to get plans together for this coming weekend.  Supposed to go to the city tomorrow and then hoboken friday, maybe even shore saturday.  But of course this is all weather permitting, it's no fun being drunk in the rain and then driving home a little buzzed.   Some good quotes:  Yo I blaze the ill'est - stagga lee every time i hear that song, i dont take it seriously becasuse....dude, he did barmitzvahs -qualm  I feel sorry for people who dont drink, when they wake up in the morning, thats as good as they're going to feel all day. - Sinatra
