He decides that the majority of the  NYC poetry community represents a bunch of bleeding heart, "Simon Says" auto-bots, and feels it is his duty to "educate you", because he's tired of your tattooed, private-pierced, Nature's Blessing wearing, Patchouli Oil stinking, bumper-sticker shoutin', victim mentality whining, conspiracy theory spinning, high-brow high-art, "I can spell better than you" bullshit.  He is passionate about a number of topics, ranging from "Gay Marriage" to "Legalizing Pot" to "Good Poetry".  Would you be interested in "civilly discussing" these topics with this individual, say, in a live format?  Just curious- let me know.
