But, I survived! w00! There back now and I'm so happy! My boredom is offically OVER!      Oh and yeah, I started that diet. I'm still eating dinner, but in small amounts and I'm not even hungry! w00t! All I have eaten today was a small peice of meat for dinner. Maybe it's working. Some of my friends and there mums from primary skool are saying I look way better and that I have lost weight from last year! IM SO HAPPY! Finally I can be kind of pretty....hopefully. hehe.      I look terrible at the moment though, I have't slept in the past 3 days. Yes, 3 days striaght. Due to some biatches from my primary skool calling me at 2 in the morning! 2 in the friggen morning! How stupid can some people get, I told them they don't have lifes if there calling me THAT early.      Well, Im bored and listening to Black Betty and Get Free by The Vines while lookin up pics of Duff McKagan who plays Bass in da band Velvet Revolvers....I loff dere song Slither! It's so MAD! I also like Jets song Cold Hard Bitch. SO MAD!      Gotta run,   Bridget.
