I have been getting these random calls for a few days.... at first nothing is said... then he started whispering hello in a creepy way, you know like he watched too many horror movies..... so then he starts whispering in English, hello, how are you, I like you.... hahahah so I have an educated stalker... after a while I get annoyed/freaked out so a friend calls to fins who it is.... It turns out to be a guy as old as my grandfather!!!!!!!!!!! He always tells me that I am like his grand-daughter.... PERVERT!!!! So now my dilemna is that I will have to deal with him a lot and I am scared of this guy.... He called me today, and I was like.. "Dr. Mohamed are you ok, why are you whispering? Is something wrong" He did not get embarrassed!!!!!!!!!  I just spent 8 hours fixing my computer... finally it is fixed and I have XP :o)) I was living the hard life of Windows 98... Now I am saved!! Well gotta go, off to drink coffee ;o))
