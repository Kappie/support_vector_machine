By the way this whole thing about Mars being so close tonight, well fuck it. I can't even see it when I walk out of my apartment. This just means that Mars does not exist in my universe. You hear that you wannabe-existing-planet-piece-of-crap-hole. For the last time and I am not going to ask Marx! I hate that man, he is like the gay version of the girls gone wild mixed with satan's computer, which is filled with outdated software made by Mircosoft.
