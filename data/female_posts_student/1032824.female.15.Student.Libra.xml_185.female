It's one of those  Laugh-my-lungs-out  day. Yipeedeedooo.. I managed to stick with my timetable today, except that I took more than 30 minutes for my bath and spent an hour taking a nap on my study table. So now I have to make up for that. I am expecting Jeremy to comment on my bath-hours.    Mrs Chua had better not do that to us anymore.  "You want to looove us, you want to huuug us, you want to kissss us.."  You know we love you!   Fiona helped me to fulfil 1/2 of my wish. So I shall repay her kindness and do what I ought to do. ;) Then we shall proceed to Plan B, to fulfil the other part of our wish. This is getting exhilarating.        Her Caress,  So Warm. So motherly. So.. Her.
