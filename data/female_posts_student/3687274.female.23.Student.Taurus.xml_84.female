My main reason for moving to Milwaukee is to be closer to school, while moving to Whitewater completely defeats that purpose...it adds another possibility.  I went to uww.edu and checked out the theater department, I wanted to see if it would be worthwhile to transfer, but it's not.  The tuition is like $2000 more than uwm.  I'm exaggerating, but it's in the 4somethings and uwm is 2977 including this year's increase.  Plus, I'm on academic probation and I just don't want to take the chance of not being able to pay for it.  So, I wont transfer.  But, luckily for me, this semester wouldn't have been that bad, because I only have two days of classes starting before noon.  So, I'd have plenty o' time to workout in the morning on any day and still make it to class on time.  But then I run in to the same problems: either I don't feel like driving to school or I drive there and realize I really don't want to be there, then turn around and come back home.  I just thought that instead of pushing myself to go everyday, I could just move to milwaukee and being so close, I wouldn't have any reason not to go.   So okay, let's list the pros and cons of moving to ww vs. milw. Pro:  Nikol is there. Con:  It's further away from school than Racine. Pro:  It's rent free in exchange for babysitting. Con:  That one doesn't really matter because my place in milw would be paid for with my student loan. Pro:  Even if I do pay rent, I wouldn't have to fork out my entire loan just to pay rent upfront (bad credit...long story).  I could use the left over to pay bills.  That counts as 2 pros. Con: My brother. Pro:  He's not my CHILD!!! Con:  But he's my brother!!!  And what about my babies!!!  That counts as 2 cons!!! Pro:  When they come to visit they'd have Trast and Ayden (did I spell that right) to play with.  Con:...  Pro:  Plus, instead of being in plays in milw, around other students that I'd see everyday, I could (if allowed) audition in ww and not be as self concious.  I'd rather audition around strangers.   milw vs. ww: Pro:  Closer to school. Con: Entire loan check toward rent depending on whether or not I move with a roomie or with my brother or alone. Pro:  Save money in gas. Con:  My brother... Pro:  not my child. Con:  still my brother. Pro:  I think, not quite sure, but I think milw has a few more bars than ww.  Higher possibility of finding a great paying bartending job.  Counts as half a pro cause my odds of finding a job increases, but it doesn't necessarily mean I'll find a GREAT job. Con:...  ww 7 pros 5 cons  milw 4 pros 3 cons  we all know that staying in racine would be more like whitewater.  but, my brother would like to stay in racine, I don't really want to.  I think I just want to leave racine.  I think I was born to be a rolling stone.   this is the bottom line.  If I do decide to move to whitewater I would see what it's like commuting first semester and I'd have to find a job before I moved there.  same for milwaukee and same for racine.  most importantly, I'd have to see what my brother wants to do, because in this case, his well being is my first priority.  I want to make sure he is good before I decide to just move some place else without him.  as stupid as some may think that is, fuck you.  he's my brother and if I was only living for myself there would be no point of living.  either way, I'm moving.
