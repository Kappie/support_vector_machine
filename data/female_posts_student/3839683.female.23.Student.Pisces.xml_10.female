It always seems that when you have something exciting going on in your life it takes forever to get there. My little cousin is participating in the JR Miss Michigan competition next weekend so that is a bit exciting. She must have got all the good looks in the family! heh heh.. oh wait that's kinda sad. So anyways I didn't say anything before but Rob and I are having trouble with a yahoo group. It's some group on yahoo that writes letters to troops. Yes the idea is nice and all but somehow they got a hold of his address over in Iraq. Looking in from the outside you might think that this is ok but Rob was a bit pissed about this. He received a letter from some girl and immediately came back to me and asked who the hell it was thinking I gave his address out. But of course I didn't give it to anyone. She gave us a little lead by saying she was from this group on yahoo. Well he wanted me to get them to pull his name off of the site. Although it was nice that they were sending letters to soldiers he did not want any from people he didn't know. That's just the way he is... he's a pretty private person and only wants letters from friends and family. Which is understandable to me. So I kindly wrote the person who ran the site and asked them to pull his name off of it and if they could please give me the name of the person who gave the address so we could get them to stop spreading it. Seems nice enough don't you think? Well they went into this big thing about soldiers having privacy and they don't know if I in fact knew him and they wouldn't remove the name for me. After this happened Rob started to email them and they still hit us with the privacy issue.. although we both commented that it's against his privacy for them to have his address on there without his permission. Anywho this yahoo group of about 23 member’s think that they are the cats meow. Like I said before it's cool what they do for other soldiers but when it comes to common sense they have none. Well this girl writes a final letter that he received today saying that I am some enraged jealous girl and I'm a bad person cause I won't let them write to him and she's going to stop writing. We both had a good laugh at that because I wasn't the one who had the problem, it was him. Anyone who knows me knows that I wouldn’t attack someone for doing something as simple as writing a letter. He actually thought that I was too nice to them. Now this little group thinks that they are going to reach his commander and ok if he is a real soldier...Like a commander in the Army has nothing better to do in a time of war then to make these little girls happy. *sigh*
