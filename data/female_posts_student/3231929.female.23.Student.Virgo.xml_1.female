Picked up some insect repellent (don't know whether it'll work on the ex!) and some sandals, although they're that funny style of cross between walking shoe and flip-flop.  Brought some clothes too. For the first time ever I didn't bother to try them on before buying, as the queue for the changing rooms was ridiculously long. Felt quite liberating just picking stuff off a rail and walking straight to the till! It is a funny world we live in.  I've just replied to some emails from some course mates who have already arrived in their elective destinations. They all sound very relaxed and chilled. All enjoying the sun too. Looking out of my window at the moment at the grey sky I feel a little jealous.  The new bookshop in the middle of town simply looked far too tempting this morning. So I attacked, emerging victorious albeit Â£21 poorer. I even picked up a copy of 'The Girl with the Pearl Earring' despite it looking like a chick book. At least I'll have something to read on the elective.   Today I feel calm and resigned about Toronto. I really know nothing about the girl we're staying with, apart from the ex saying she has plans to go out partying every night. That's fine and great with me, but the clubbing/drinking scene just isn't my cup of tea, so if they want to go then that's fine. I have a guide book to the city and I'm looking forward to exploring it. Being realistic about needing to spend sometime apart from the ex is I hope going to prevent too much irritation.
