We we over-estimated our time of arrival so we ended up getting pretty damn good seats... unintentionally!  So, lawn seats were nice... until everyone and their mom started to cram in next to us!  There was an estimated 100,000 people stuffed into Alpine Valley!  That was crazy!  Sooo many people tokin' up, I probably got Second Hand High!  Kate and I felt so relaxed and everything was glourious!  Well since we had never smoked before, I guess I really dont know what its like!  But, we thought we were!  Lots of Beer was spilled on us, and lots of dumb girls!  But overall the music was good, I wanted  Dave  to play Satellite, but he never did!  Sad!  And I got to meet BJ, who is a very attractive man, with 3 tattoos, and is a constrution contractor... at 18!  WOW  So, I met a new friend, got closer to another, and introduced a Madisonite- to a Madisonite!  Fun stuff! The journey out of the parking lot was adventurous, scary, bitchy, and food filled!  So, whoever thought that parking cars in 3 car rows was a smart idea.... should be shot immediately!  So, of course, we were in the middle, so we had to wait for a car to leave in front or behind us!  Sucked! so when we did get out, there were these bitchy girls who wouldn't pick up their lawn chairs and move 10 ft. to let 3 cars go through!  Bitches, Tom called them *the C-Word*  and I thought their drunk asses were gonna attempt to kick ours!  So, a total of an hour, and some hamburgers later, we were out of the parking... lawn.  So, the rest of the trip was pie and we got home around 12:30... Where I instantly hopped in the shower to clean off all the beer, smoke, and grass.  Wow, I have never felt so clean and refreshed after an event before!  Amazing!  So, although the music was ok, my first experience to Alpine Valley was something I will never forget!  First time I had ever seen anyone toke up in public!  Wow, thats weird! And first time to ever feel the effects of Pot... by inhaling everyones exhale!  Not cool!  So, being the only 4 people NOT fucked up, we definitely got to know eachother better, enjoyed the music, and laughed at everyone passing out, and wasted in the amplitheater!   Definitely A day I will never forget!  8-8-04  Dave Matthews Band!  Off to sleep!  g'nite  ;o)
