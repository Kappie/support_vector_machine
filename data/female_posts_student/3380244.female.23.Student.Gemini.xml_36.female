"well, can you please check, because i'm allergic?" and he said... "i'm sure... there are no nuts in that one, it's just vanilla ice cream, raspberry swirls, and chunks of chocolate." so i ordered myself a cone of that and went along my merry way... 3 licks into the ice cream cone i realize that the chocolate chunks are crunchy, becuase they have NUTS IN THEM! my goodness people- this is sooooo not something to take lightly!!! people must think allergies mean- sneezing, coughing, or scratching?! when i say i'm deathy allergic to nuts, they must think i'm kidding? ben wanted to go back to the ice cream shop and smash it in that man's face, but we didn't. oddly enough, i get embarassed when this happens... it happens frequent enough, but i rarely make an issue of it.  i'm off to the chiropractor... yay!
