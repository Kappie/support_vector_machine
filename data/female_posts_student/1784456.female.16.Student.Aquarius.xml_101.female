Grr, I'm sooooo sick of cutting carrots I mean argh! It's so annoying having to peel carrots and cut them up...I should start a save the carrots thing...hehe. Mmm now my hand hurts, and yes, I do work in a slave place. Well it's like one, it's called living in a house with a Mum and a Dad. (It's awful isn't it?)
