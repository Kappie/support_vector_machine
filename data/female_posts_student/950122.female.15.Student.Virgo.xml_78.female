But my mom's in the hospital, and she's going to have an operation tomorrow morning. I'm worried. My dad won't tell me anything. I'm staying at Camilla's house because he's going to stay in the hospital and there will be no one in the house with me.  I'm scared.  *today's post* I just found out this morning that the surgery will be on one of her ovaries. They found a growth, and they're going to remove it this afternoon. I pray everything will be alright.
