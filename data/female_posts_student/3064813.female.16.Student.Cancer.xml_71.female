You're sometimes looked down upon as less than mature and your 'now, now, now' attitude, and you usually act on whims instead of thinking things out. But you're a fun person to have around, and there are a lot of people that care deeply for you.    urlLink   Which Female Inuyasha Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      There really should be some kind of law against this.  I keep trying to console myself by reminding myself that it's just a QUIZ how the HELL can a computerized quiz know the first (or second, for that matter) thing about me?  But every time I take one of these things it always calls me immature and naive.  I think... it's time to own up to the fact that I AM immature and I AM naive.  On the brighter side; fun to be around!  Huzzah!
