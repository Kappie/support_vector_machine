So I guess I'm pretty much just going to use it to talk about stuff I like, and naturally, stuff I hate. So since I don't have much else to say right now, here's a personal favorite song of mine that ties in with the blog title-  "Living easy, living free, Season ticket on a one-way ride, Asking nothing, leave me be, Taking everything in my stride, Don't need reason, don't need rhyme, Ain't nothing I would rather do, Going down, party time, My friends are gonna be there too!  I'm on the highway to Hell! On the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! I'm on the highway to Hell!  No stop signs, speed limit, Nobody's gonna slow me down, Like a wheel, gonna spin it, Nobody's gonna mess me round, Hey Satan, payin' my dues, Playing in a rocking band, Hey Momma, look at me, I'm on my way to the promised land!  I'm on the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! I'm on the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell!  Don't stop me!  I'm on the highway to Hell! On the highway to Hell! I'm on the highway to Hell! On the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! I'm on the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! I'm on the Highway to Hell! Highway to Hell!  And I'm going down, all the way! I'm on the highway to Hell."  AC/DC - Highway to Hell - "Highway to Hell"
