I really consider them my half sister now because i can really really relate to them....i have never share so much secrets in person other than these 2 girls....most of the time i prefer writing letters. However, among 2 of them, i have to admit that i am more incline towards TY, i don't know why. Maybe it's her personality that makes the difference. i have never met someone (i know i have only lived for 22years) as generous as her. I mean, she can't be compared to Mother Teressa but to her standard, i can really say that she's truly a generous person. She's smart and capable.....i think i made her my role model at this moment. She's someone that i truly hope that will be really happy and joyful for the rest of her life. Everytime, when i see her stressed out, i really hope that i can help but i just don't know how. I know i won't be able to cheer her up but at the same time i really hope that something could be done. I, myself will be feeling terrible when she's not having a good day....sigh...if only i can make all her wishes come true.....here i wish that whatever that is going to happen in the future will be the way you've wanted it to be....
