I thought you had no feelings for me that first day so full of conversation,  then you opened up to me  I thought I'd fly away at your very touch  then you spoke to me  I smiled Your every word something I looked forward to,  I wonder why I did Because I seem to be at a loss for you. I hate to love you; I promised to let you know when I did, Yet it's a secret I keep to myself, One I think you know about but you dont say so, You let me keep telling you what I dont feel, And now you're waiting- Waiting for me to tell the truth with your every word  you constantly give me reasons to say it But the longer I wait, The farther you go- Away from love; away from me.
