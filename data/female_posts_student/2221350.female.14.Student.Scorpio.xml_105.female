((not to mention the fact that road runner has been down lately)). Nobody seems to be blogging, anywhere. Every day I go down a list of blogs in my favorites, and for the past couple days it's been completely dead. Maybe people have stuff to do, I sure as hell don't.  this week was kind of like throwup. You know, a little bit of everything all mixed together and then it leaves a big stain on the carpet. throwup seems to be an analogy you find a lot on blogs these days. The spewing of emotional vomit as one would call it. The same with the word "rambling" and "random" and "my life". This is why my blog had to have a unique title, and I think it's why people are tempted to visit when they see the link.   the biggest issue right now would be the reading of the blog by the mother. Because of my last couple posts, she's been freaking out and trying to fix everything, which is working out great but is still a little weird since she's always quoting me and talking to me about whatever I was whining about on that particular day. Yesterday she  said she was going to let me decorate the room I share with shitmunch any way I wanted because I had written that I missed my old room. She also came home from the grocery store with yogurt the other day, remarking that they were out of king vitamin((see previous post if you don't understand the significance of king vitamin and yogurt)). She's been just kind of weird and paranoid, worried that I will snap at any second.  mom said she would consider my moving to France as an exchange student in France. I would live with her friend Pierre((who she's been to visit)) and would stay there for my junior year. I told her I would do it without having to think for one second, and that's the truth. I have no attachments to anything here, no person or thing or place that I would miss. I hate this town, it's disgusting and full of horrible people with no aspirations or desire to live, we all just skulk by, waiting for the next bump in the road so we can trudge over and then bitch about it later.  the last thing she promised me was a kitten. I think if someone brought me a kitten and said I could keep it I'd just die of happiness. I love cats, I love the cat I have now, and I can tell that he needs companionship. I was so upset when we gave away mei-ling and merlot I just didn't know what to do, and I can tell that max((my cat)) misses having other cats to keep him company. Mom said that some time within the next couple days she would bring one home, claiming it was a stray, and that she would convince mammaw to let me keep it.   under other circumstances I would feel bad because cats are bad for my grandmother's breathing, but seeing as she has started smoking like a chimney, like 3 chimneys, a little cat dander won't even begin to do as much damage.   the very last thing mom did for me was to tell mammaw that they weren't going to fight in front of me. Well that one didn't last for long. This morning mammaw said something snotty and they got into a screaming, howling, screeching argument about the fact that mom had had a drink. Well mom had had a drink because Devon was being a little bitch and even though mom has been driving her downtown for three days so she could go to an art convention, she's still got the nerve to be a bastard. So mom wanted to slice her in little pieces but instead she popped her on the butt. Well you see, at my house, we only get spankings if it's something severely severe. in my life, I've never had a spanking, and devon's had like 4. So mom was crazy upset that she had "beaten her child"((oh puh-leaze)) and mammaw just couldn't leave it alone. So as soon as they started the fighting I slipped on my shoes and started walking down the street. a few minutes later mom chased me down and we walked while she boo-hooed about everything.   she said she felt bad for fighting in front of me but mammaw was the one who started it and I told her that mammaw is the type of person who thrives on arguments and that she shouldn't buy into them. I told her that what bothered me the most are the asinine things that they argue about and that if they wanted to debate about politics in the livingroom then it was fine but they were NOT going to screech at each other like baboons over something stupid like 4 oz. Of scotch or a cigarette. I told her that she should consider the subject matter before she engages in conflict, considering how little it will affect the outcome of anything it happens to involve. I think she listened.   lately Devon has been a super bitch and everyone is noticing. She is ALWAYS in a bad mood, she never has anything nice to say, and she end ALL of her sentences with "uh". ((noooooouh! yesssssssuh! leave me aloooooonuh!)). She is a bitch, nobody wants to be around her, and we're all practically afraid of her.   on Friday night I went to coffee house, which is a fundraiser for the gifted and talented program where everyone comes and eats while people in gateway((GT program)) perform. It was a really great show. My friend Edward played his fiddle((which he's been playing for eleven years, so you know he was amazing)) and my other friend tubbs wrote a blues song and sang it while he played guitar and harmonica. tubbs' song was definitely my favorite.  for some reason I have been crazy tired all weekend. I keep sleeping and sleeping for no reason. I slept 12 hours Friday night, had a three hour nap Saturday, and slept 9 hours last night.   I have one of those feelings in my stomach, you know, kind of sick-like, but more premonitory. I think everyone's got that feeling. I hope something more exciting happens next week.  by the way, is there ANYONE who can hear the music playing when they visit my site?
