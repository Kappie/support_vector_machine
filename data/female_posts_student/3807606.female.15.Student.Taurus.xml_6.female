But then I wake up to reality and realize i'm just the same old Julia and I can't change that. Being myself is all I can do to get through life. I guess people will love you for you. You should never change to be someone else to suite another's needs/wants. Enless you are changing for yourself, you'll never be happy. Whenever I get in the mood to want to be like someone famous, I want higher expectations of people and then it turns out bad. *stupid stupid* I've learned that you can pretend but eventually reality will hit you in the back of the head and you just need to go back to living in good old Fort Wayne, Indiana and be a normal teenager. ~*xoxo*~*ju
