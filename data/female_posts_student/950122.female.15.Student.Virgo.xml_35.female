I never thought I'd meet him. :P I got a poster, a mag, his latest CD and his autograph! :D Sure isn't something that happens everyday. It all happened like this. My family and I went to Church, then we went to a local mall for lunch. While we were eating, my brother text his classmate from 2nd grade (from Japan). One of her friends had found my brother's website, and signed the guestbook, giving him Marielle's (bro's classmate from 2nd grade) e-mail address. He e-mailed her, and it turned out that she was here in the Philippines, right next to Ateneo, which is pretty close. So, she e-mailed him her cell number. They text each other, and she said that she was going to Greenbelt, a strip of nice restaurants and cafes near Makati. My mom, always wanting my brother to go out, had us pick her up and to go Greenbelt. :P So, we went there, and went to Music 1, a music store where Marielle's friends work. It also turned out that Duncan Sheik was to be there at 2:30 p.m  (We got there at 2:00 p.m) for autograph signing. So we stayed there because Marielle had been listening to his music ever since she was in 5th grade. Then he came, and I met Duncan Sheik. Cool huh? :D  Tests are next month~! Geez, time flies.
