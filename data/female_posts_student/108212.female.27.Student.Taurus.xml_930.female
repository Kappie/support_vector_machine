BTW, I didn't have enough pledges to get a free sweatshirt but I wanted one so badly that I ended up pledging to myself just so I could meet the minimum pledge requirement.  How pathetic is that?  One of the people really raised $1300 all by themselves!  Can you believe it?  I told Sarah and Ash, "I know who we're going to recruit on our team next year!"  LOL!
