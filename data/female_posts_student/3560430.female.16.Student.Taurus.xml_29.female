I take over kitchens and although I try to be nice every time I allow somebody else into the kitchen (doesn't matter which one) I cringe because they are not doing it the same way I am. The problem is I am at my bethies house and it is her kitchen under seige! You see we are both controll hogs...i DON'T THINK SHE FORGIVES MY KITCHEN CONTROLL HABITS AS SHE TOO IS NATURALLY OVERBEARING... Oop caps lock key... Didn't mean to press that...  I'm being glared at right now. It's not that I don't trust her cooking skills it's that I know mine... I don't know hers... as well... She's picky... I'm not... Well the kitchen pirate must return... It no wonder the people in my foods class generally hate or love me... I swear I'm nice when I'm not cooking.   WEll I will post later I must over see cooking etc... I will trust her when we move in.  Maybe if I keep chanting that it will come true.
