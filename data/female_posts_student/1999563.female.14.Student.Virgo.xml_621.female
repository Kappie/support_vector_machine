Well, today I am going to church and taking a shower to get rid of my 80s hair. I think that's it. I am probably just going to relax because I leave tomorrow morning for camp. Lalala.  I am so excited for camp yet I am scared at the same time.  it seems like I am clsoe to God right now and hopefully this camp will just increase the closeness. It's like a...I don't know. it's hard to explain but bassicly at camp you just listen to speakers speak. Woohoo! It will be nice to sit instead of having to dance all day!  I am kind of scared about the people who will be attending the camp though. I am the only one who is going that I know. [haha] I don't even know my roomate. it will be okay though. La de do.
