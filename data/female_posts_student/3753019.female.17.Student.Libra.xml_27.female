DAVE MATTHEWS BABY!  though it is quite boring, being at home alone all day. my oh-so-concerned mother left with nothing but a demand that i do all the laundry by the time she gets home. of course this was after she woke me up at 7:30 to make the kids lunch and get them dressed and ready for school. i love having an irresponsible parent.  i'm realizing that for once, i think i'm content with who i am. i havent been longing to be someone else, or so much like someone else in a while. i havent wished to have someone elses life, looks, or talents. not to say there arent things in my life i wouldnt change. (well, really, the only thing i would change right now would be for tara's parents to let us hang out, and then to fix all of this school crap) but i feel happy. now i only get upset over stupid things. like if i dont get to see aaron at all for one whole day, or if he doesnt call me after hours of being preoccupied to let me know what he's up to. that and the fact that my mother still doesnt do much around the house and always leaves it to me to do things. nothing significant though.  rarely will boredom drive me to do the things i am told to do. which even today is not the case. but i am going to go ahead and do the laundry. i dont feel like getting bitched at today. i dont have the energy for that and then work at 6.
