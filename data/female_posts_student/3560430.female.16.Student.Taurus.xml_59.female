My parents and I (as you know) went to their grand opening tonight, some of the best I've ever had. I didn't think that I'd like squid, but what do you know I did.   Tomorrow is Movie day Yay that is going to be loads of fun.   Got lots of writing done today editing editing editing, lots of editing. I like most of what I've written but it's not as great as it could be, maybe I'm just too picky. Well I've still go tstuff to do, so I'll post later. Bye-E
