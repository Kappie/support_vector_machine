Especially when the prize is sumthing that I should of had from the start, but the other person is...and ruined it. *cough cough* No, I am not obvious. Im just always pissed. I rarely talk about my problems, as people now know. I never did before, why start now. In all reality, I know there might be a few people who actually care and want to know..The others jut go and form a pity crowd. But Ive already been thru that explanation.  Our bus rides are very interesting..*COUGH COUGH* Our small group.. you know what I mean. And yet again, I am the only one who didnt get anything. Tear. But thats ok. Conneaut is in 2 days. Which means a hour and a half bus ride. I know who I'm sitting with..*smile cheesy grin*  School starts in about 12 days. Thats too soon for me. I need more time to listen to my 'Fuck off because the world doesnt care on the back of the bus music.' Not really..I need someone who cares.. Later..
