Went to a goodbye Party for Tom. :-( Tried a whole bunch of new things...saw all the exchangers again...;-) We (Maju, Carlos and I) went to pick up Matt and went to a club/pub thing in Lagoa de Conceição, right across the street from where we all went for Mexican on wednesday. Go figure. ;-) Got there at shortly after midnight and met up with:   Steve:  An aussie I believe. Cool guy.  Fun to talk to. Hopefully see him again before I go home.  Bruna:  Brasilian. I've talked about Bruna before. She's uh...wow, cool is getting redundent.  Kate:  USA. Hyper girl! ;-) That never was a bad thing though.  Nathan:  Aussie...hehehe  Tom:  Hawaii. His going away party. :-( That sucks. I barely get a chance to know these people.  Rebecca:  USA. Tom's girlfriend??  Petra:  New Zealand. Hehehe, Petra's cool. Apparently she had to live with Kylee for 5 days as well....poor thing. ^_~  So yeah, we hung out there until 2ish, before heading off to some random part of the city. (No matter how many times someones tells me, I can't remember the name for the life of me)  Man...I got maybe 1/2 hour of sleep last night? Ugh...I don't know why I couldn't sleep. @_@ I'm so confused...grrr.....Robin, Willeke, or Paul (Zeke), where are you when I need to talk?? hehehe...Willeke, I really hope you at least come online soon, you lazy cow. ;) Finally, your word is doing some retaliation! Please, get out of bed (I know it's   only   quarter to eleven there...) *laughs*  But seriously....soon!  -Hannah
