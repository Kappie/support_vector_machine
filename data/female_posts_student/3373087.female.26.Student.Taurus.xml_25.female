I want to post digital pics of B and me on my blog so I can look at them whenever I want to. Yesterday I showed DGD the group picture with B in it taken 2 years ago at Todd's 4th of July BBQ. She was so funny--while I was downloading the picture, she was like, "I've never seen a picture of him before! This is an important moment!" She even covered her face until I had the picture fully downloaded so she can see it all at once. Hehe. I think she has high hopes for our relationship because of how well Mom is responding to it.   I've had a good time here in LA so far. DGD and I talked for a long time last night. I told her about the whole housing fiasco with Aviv and what I learned on my IM rotation. Then I told her about my own search for an apartment and how I found one for $800. When she heard that my rent was nearly going to double (I pay $445 now) she was a little shocked and didn't think it was such a good idea. "How is this going to affect your budget!?!", she said. I told her I would have to cut back, but I honestly can't think of any more ways that I can live more simply. Mom usually pays for my clothes if we go shopping (which is rarely happensduring the school year) and my only other expenses are cell phone, utilities, gas, and food. Well, lately I have been spending quite a bit more on airfare to Boston and LA, but I'm not sure if these fall into the catagory of "luxury" or "necessity". She asked me if I considered getting a roomate later on to share the cost, but I told her that I was planning on living alone. I'm already one to be money conscious and that fact that she doesn't like how high my rent is makes me even more worried. Afterall, she DOES support me financially so she does have a somewhat ofa right to say how she wants me to spend the money she gives me.She asked me if Mom has been giving me money, and I told her that she gave me cash for my Boston and this LA trip. I honestly don't know how much she gave me because I didn't actually count it. I told DGD about $300, but it's probably more. She gave me a high wad of cash a few weeks ago (which I haven't spent a dime of so far) and another wad yesterday. Some of it is going into the Christine and Brandon Fund because I feel bad that B has been contributing so much.
