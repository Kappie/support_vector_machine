Instead of feeling wonderfully content and spontaneous, because I never have plans, I feel lost and alone.  It has gotten to the point where my errands are the highlight of my week.  When did this happen when did I fall off of the face of the planet? Why did this happen?  I've taken to sitting in seclusion and watching shows like Sex and the City.  Wow... Any way summer is approaching and instead of feeling good about that I'm scared.  What if everyone has forgotten about me when I come home, or worse, I forget about everyone.  I don't want to stay at camp all summer because I want time with friends, but will we really ever do something? Or, will it be like last summer where I was home but they weren't or I was home but working, or I was just too lazy to pick up the phone.  A better question to have started this entry with would have been, when did I become so insecure?  Instead of feeling better for writing this I feel worse, so I think I'll stop while I still have a shred of self respect. Do I really mean that?  Argh, my world seems to be such a mess right now.  Flying really isn't fun when you don't know how to land, but realize you are running out of gas.  What I really need is a genie to straighten it all up again.  *sigh*
