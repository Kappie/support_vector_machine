She doesn't just taste or nip.  She doesn't just dip her finger and lick it or take the cup and sip it.  She lifts the liquid to her lips and drinks, gulping and swallowing like the parched pilgrim she is.  She drinks until the mercy flows down her chin and onto her neck and chest.  She drinks until every inch of her soul is moist and soft.  She comes thirsty and she drinks. She drinks deeply.   he, on the other hand, doesn't even know he's thirsty.  People like him don't need grace; they analyze it.  They don't request mercy; they debate and prorate it.  It wasn't that he couldn't be forgiven; he just never asks to be.   So while she drinks up, he puffs up. While she has ample love to give,  he hasno love to offer. "A person who is forgiven little shows only little love."  We can't give what we've never received.  If we've never received love, how can we love others?   Receive first, love second.   So thirsty for God's love. Those who should have loved didn't.  Those who could have loved didn't. Left at the altar. Left with an empty bed.  Left with a broken heart. Left with "Does anybody love me?"   God loves me. Personally. Powerfully. Passionately. Others have promised and failed.  But God has promised and succeeded. God loves me with an unfailing love.  And his love- if I will let it - can fill me and leave me with a love worth giving.   So come. Come thirsty and drink deeply.
