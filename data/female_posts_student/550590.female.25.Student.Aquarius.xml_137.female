The apartments are so much nicer and more appropriately priced than in Gainesville. Apparently there's some law that says that apartment complexes cant tell you if the people who live there are students or minorities. When Bruce asked if the neighborhood was quiet, one complex said they couldn't answer that either. What a pain in the ass...I'm in Orlando for Easter, and I spent the weekend tiling my house and installing plastic wood flooring in the bedrooms. I'll post some pictures soon. The walls in my house are Bliss Blue...and it's very, well...blissful. My house is going to be so awesome. On Saturday Bruce and I went with Dad to Home Depot to pick out my white fence...not a picket fence mind you, but close. We didn't get a picket one because Zoe would be less likely to escape. Then we tiled and cleaned and vacuumed and it was all very exhausting. Around noon Bruce and I met Thomas and his girlfriend Becca at Chilis for lunch. Thomas and I really need to spend more time together than 1 or 2 hours every 6 months. Sigh.  Tomorrow I'm going to spend the day at UCF spending money I don't have on things for classes I can't afford to take and meeting with several professors in the School of Social Work about getting/skipping credits and a possible source of part-time income. I'm really excited about going back to school and learning and being stressed for good reason rather than feeling like I'm beating my head against the wall.   One more weekend of tiling and then it's time for INTERIOR DESIGN! Woohoo! I'll try to take some pictures of the house and to update my website over the next few weeks...we'll see. Bruce and I have been toying with the idea of redesigning my website for about 8 months now. Who knows, I'll have more motivation to procrastinate starting in August.  Until next time...
