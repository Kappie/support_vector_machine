About um some killer truck driver out to get kids or something. Yeah I don't know. Wow, I really am tired. I did a lot today too. Well for me. And for it being the summer. I'm not really in any better of a mood. Infact...a little worse. Only one crying session today though. I haven't been able to keep down food however. Infact...just writing that out is kind of not making me feel all that well. Um today I got the honor of cleaning the back of the house. Unfortunatley I didn't think it would take that long and I wore some new clothes. Yeah not a good idea. 45 minutes later I was wet, sweaty and muddy. See I had to scrub the back of the house of this weird mold/fungus stuff that was growing...And there are bushes everywhere...with bugs....and dirt....and I had to keep moving this huge ladder around to get up high. There was this one daddy long legs which I swear was following me around no matter how many times I hit it off the wall. I'd turn around and there it was again! Freaky stuff. I hate bugs.  Oh Sean, if you want to you can see if you want to meet Desiree at the concert since you haven't seen her for awhile and what not. And since she'll be there and everything. That'd be fine and you want to see her right? I am sure she wants to see you. And I am sure I'll be ok by Thursday to still go.
