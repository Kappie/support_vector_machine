Oh I did meet some of my internet friends at the Mall of America a bit ago. That was pretty cool there nice and I believe one of em *Paul* is gonna ask out my friend *Kristen* so that might be interesting.  A few nights ago I was burning a *My Little Pony* lol don't ask and its all Plasticy rubberish and it started dripping and I got some on my finger and I got a icky blister and it hurt so bad but like two days ago the blister just.... Fell off lol and now its all * I HATE YOUUU* and scabby and ouch *nods again*   I've been feeling a lot better lately ^__^ happy and horny hahaha ANNNNND I dyed my hair again!
