We were still waiting for someone to wake us up and tell us it was a dream or someone would knock on the door and tell us that we got the wrong apartment, but it never happened. Soon my Father awoke, followed by my Brother and after a splash in the pool we all got dressed and headed down to the small supermarket to get some nosh for breakfast as we had nothing in the villa.  Soon after finishing our breakfast of french toast, jam and such forth, we all again, went into the pool or sunbathed. This was the continuing theme until lunch, when we went back to the supermarket to get some bread, cheese, ham and other things for a snachish lunch as we were going out for dinner.  Upon finishing everyone went back to what they were doing previously. My Father, reading his newly purchased Bill Bryson book. My Mother reading some other book she had brought along, inbetween floating around the pool on our huge rubber ring. My Brother diving in and out of the water with a pair of googles that were designed for children and didn't fit around his head. Eventually abandoning the straps and just using sucktion to sick them over his eyes. Then there is me, sitting in the shade, or sunbathing (or as I call it, burning), or taking a dip in the pool. Swimming underwater most of the time, my favorite thing to do in the water. While me and my Father were in the pool we heard a chirping noise coming from near by, we discovered a small turqise, black and white parakeet. It stayed around for a while and we managed to get really close and take some great photographs of it. I can't wait to see them.   urlLink    A photo of Lanzarote that we could see on our walks into town.  urlLink      Soon the sun began to lower and we all dried off and got changed and strollled down town. This time my Mother spent along time deciding where to go. I was pissed off at this time because I was burnt and my feet ached becuase flip flops are not designed for walking lond distance. She finally decided on a grill resturant called "Poco Loco". Bad Choice. I have had better ready meals from the supermarket. We all vowed never to go back and that tomorrow night we would go back to "Slow Boat II" as we knew we would get good food and service.  Once we were back we stayed up a bit later and jsut talked about almost anything. My Brother brought up his repetetive joke of me being a lesbian. I was being sarcastic and agreeing with him and I sneakly asked my Mum how she would react if I was a lesbian. She said she would abandon me or thow me out if I was that way inclined. This clinched my feeling to tell her about being bisexual, but not tonight.  Soon I began to feel tired and setteled into bed and difted off into dream world....*Zzzzzzzzz*
