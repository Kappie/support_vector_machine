Nice to hear from you but I thought you were going to call. It's weird not having you at my ear for a wk O:-). Anyway somehow I'm writing a gossip column for GSS... yea... oh well it'll be juicy. I don't know who all knows this but my RA, Lisa, wanted a GS couple in her group...well we found one! Satomi, this really cute Japanese girl, is pairing up with this guy from MLK...this same guy that I danced chinese with. It's so cute. I also get to tease her so much...you think I'm oblivious to some jokes....she missed a pool noodle joke... smile! Anyway I gotta go and take care k? Love ya and see ya soon. Oh yea and WRITE ME!!!! I'm starting a letter wall....send a pic too so I can put it on my webpage. Love you again O:-)
