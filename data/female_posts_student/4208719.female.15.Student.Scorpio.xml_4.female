He graduated in June, fyi, and I didn't think I'd see him again until the alumni band played at Homecoming. But noo he had to bring his brother to auditions today, and since bass clarinets don't audition at my school, I was sitting here on my computer when he was there. Darn it all. And ash (a senior and fellow bass clarinetist) said he was lookin pretty fine. Well maybe he'll bring his bro to band camp too. (fyi our band camp is held at our school from 830-400 this tues-fri)  :-P
