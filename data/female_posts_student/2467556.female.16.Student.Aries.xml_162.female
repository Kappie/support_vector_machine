I had to take 3 motrin and ice down my knee for awhile. i'm really hoping that these swelling knees and bruises, as wicked awesome as they are, will go away before my friend's wedding. i dunno if Vivian's hott cousins will go for the banged up knees with a pretty dress look.  so i tried to sign up for scholarships today.....didn't work  monday, i leave for church camp with the gang! woop woop! its going to be exciting, i'm sure. so hopefully i get to hang out with jessica and brittany (maybe, she might be gone aaaall day to six flags with some of her barn friends) on sunday because they're both leaving on thursday while i'm gone and i won't get to see them for a whole week and a half or more!!! Jessica is leaving for Oklahoma to visit some friends and Brittany is off to Canada. Britt - if you buy me some canadian candy, i swear i'll pay you back :)   alright, i haven't slept well in 4 days for some reason....lets see if the running total increases to 5 tonight! cheers  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
