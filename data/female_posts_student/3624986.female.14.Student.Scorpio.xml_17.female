I will probably name my posts after songs/song lines until I run out or can't think of one.  I know you all probably don't care, but that's okeydokey with me--not my damn problem.  I am a writer.  I write fiction.  Genre-bending, not-so-teenie-bopper fiction.  I write whatever the hell I want, including poetry, songs, horror/thrillers, and an epic fantasy tale that needs a few "Monster" Edits.  I have created my own language, my own worlds, and my own best friends.  I have a God-given knack for the art of "wordslinging", and by all the Gods it's fun as hell to use it on unsuspecting people.  I doubt any of the things I post in here will be real, because my "real life" is very boring.  Real life, in general, is very boring.  I don't intend to write anything about my life, especially my most personal things, but that's to be expected, I think.  It's the Internet, for God's sake.  Can you tell how old I am?  Oh, well, I don't really care whether you can or not.  It doesn't matter.  The world moves on and age will make no difference.  We all die in due time anyhow.  No mortal nor immortal, man nor woman, deity nor human, can strike dead the Gan of one with nothing else to live for.  But who would want to live forever?   By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. Be she child with mournful soul Saturnine is she, never in control...
