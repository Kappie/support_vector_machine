"ok. hahaha." "why are you laughing?" "i have no idea. hahaha"  needless to say, mom was pissed and i got lectured on how i need to "save the giggling for later, addie!"  meanwhile, i have to keep pounding my chest to make it feel better and its NOT funny when i look like a wigger doing it.     hahahahahaha. just kidding. i laugh everytime i do it.
