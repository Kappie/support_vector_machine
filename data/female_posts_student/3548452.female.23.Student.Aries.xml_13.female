It kinda sucks 'cause I'm used to the companionship with a member of the opposite sex. I guess I'm one of those rare people that knows how to separate friendship from love, but if you try to mix the two, it wont even work.... I wrote a poem about the way I was feeling and everybody seemed to like it so here it goes :  April 27.2004  Foolish Heart    I can’t pretend this is the first time   you know damn well it’s not,  I learn to depend only on me  ‘cause myself is all I’ve got  Don’t act like you don’t know  What this is all about  I’ve become so used to this pain  I don’t know how I live without  This pain feels like the knife  You slid into my back   every night of sleep I’ve lost  Trying not to react  My chest goes numb every time  I force myself not to cry   that only happens every night  When I’m alone  can’t help but wonder why  I can’t pretend it’s okay anymore  To be so sad I can’t move on  Tomorrow when I open my eyes  I’ll wish that you were gone  But you’ll always be around to twist  That knife into this heart of mine  U that’s how I know you have no soul;  No feeling, no heart, no spine  You’ve never felt pain so deep  It clouds your mind so you can’t see  Or you’d never feel good about this pain  That you daily inflict on me.  That about describes my pain right now. I'm not all about man bashing all the time. I can be your best friend or your worst enemy- you take your pick.
