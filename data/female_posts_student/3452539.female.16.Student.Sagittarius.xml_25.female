Wow, my fingers do not want to wrok to type tonight. Very tired.  Wet out with my mom for the morning. Then cleaned. Then went to Jennifer's with Rob, Evan, and Mely. Did nothing. Remembered things of old and watched them beat the crap out of each other. Then Justin and Jenniger felt to baby-sit and the rest were to follow to get smoked up. I requested that I be brought home. Ended up plying pool again. Did fairly well for my standards anyways.   Well, I am sooooo tired. Talkt to y'all, later.   -J9
