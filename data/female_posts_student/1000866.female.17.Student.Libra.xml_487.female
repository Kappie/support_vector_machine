It's stinky. Heh...literally...  But, yeah...I don't think I'm going to get to do anything with Bryan before I go on Thursday or any of my friends for that matter. Ohhh well. Such is life.  I'm going to the bookstore in a few minutes. YaY!! I know I'm really weird but I love book stores. I just love new books actually. I could spend like...days in a book store and not get bored. Maybe hungry and tired but not bored. I think I'm going to try to be a good kid and study for my history test. Maybe I'll actually take notes this time. He says we can have two pages of notes for every test we take and yet....I never use notes. It's kind of funny how I got an A in there last quarter without using any notes and some people used two pages of notes for every test and got a D in the class. I'm not particularily fond of most of my History class anyway so...it's ok.    OK....off to dinner...yum...then the bookstore. YaY!
