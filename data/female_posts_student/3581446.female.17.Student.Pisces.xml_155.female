We're doubting, but there are a lot of good things about it:   --- The neighbourhood is better. Police actually dares to enter it at night, unlike the gang-infested "hood" we live in now.  See a photo of our neighbours.  --- It has a park! I love parks. Last time I stayed in that area, I recall music playing every evening around 6pm in that park. Lovely!  --- The apartment is bigger, and has old wooden doors, which is just cool compared to the new and cheap material apartment we live in now.  --- It's right next to the Plaza Mexico,  the largest bullfighting arena in the whole friggin' world . (50 000 seats, yo.)  Ofcourse, where there is good, there's always bad (that's philosophy for ya, Theo):   --- There is no subway entrance. One has to take a bus to get to the subway. Where we live now, there is a subway right around the corner. You need a subway if you don't have a car in a city of 20 million inhabitants.  See a photo of the few inhabitants of our apartment building at a party.  --- The building is quite old, therefore has no special earthquake architecture and magical building materials. And stuff. --- The park with the music has.. bugs. I'm not talking about cute little ladybugs or anything. I'm talking about mean, fat killer bugs that crawl all over your seats and start chewing your leg while you're trying to listen to some gentle muzak from the seventies.  See a photo of one of those bugs attacking a bus parked in front of the park.  --- The apartment is right above a restaurant, and  that can mean only one thing.
