It might be better maybe if you take away my diabetes so that I could enjoy the convections I make....Maybe if you take away the fact I have to work in the morning....Maybe if you add  urlLink a gorgeous man  to the mix. Or maybe I should quit thinking about how to make it better and enjoy  urlLink Johnny  and  urlLink Orlando  in the privacy of my lonesome abode. If it is any conciliation...I have discovered I make really good fudge.  I have not written in a while. I say this at the beginning of just about every blog entry that I write. At least I am consistent. At least. I work and I rehearse. I do not have much else that takes me away from writing. There is  urlLink Brenden,  who does have more time to spend with me now the he is unemployed and out for winter break from school. I worry about him quite a bit. I worry that he is keeping himself from doing things to be with me...I worry that he won't be able to go to Japan this summer...I worry that I ask too much of him. He has spent the last week with me and it has been absolutely wonderful. He met my mothers side of the family at our annual Christmas shindig last night. Everyone very much approved...Something I was actually not used to with previous significant others I have brought with me. It was great to feel as proud as I did. The evening was not all fun and laughs however, and ended with my cousin-in-law Tim using his AAA membership to call a tow truck for  urlLink Brenden's  car that wouldn't start after we got to my aunt's house. As of this evening it was still in the shop with a tentative departure tomorrow morning.   I went to see "Return of the King" the day it came out. I had bought tickets for  urlLink Brenden  and I online for the 2:45 pm showing on the 17th. He was scheduled to take his Japanese final at 9 that morning, take care of a thing or two afterwards and head on up here to pick me up and see the show. The way things worked out, he didn't end up getting into Palmdale till 2:35 and we rushed to the theatre just in time to see the massive line that had formed outside working its way into the theatre. We were able to go to the kiosk in the lobby, get the tickets I purchased online, get into the theatre without having to wait outside in the cold AV weather, and just in time to see the new "Harry Potter" movie trailer. The theatre was full but we got pretty good seats. What I was dreading would turn into a horrible "LOTR" movie experience turned out to be quite the opposite. Plus, as a bonus, I unknowingly ran into one of my bestest buds  urlLink Clare  who was there watching it with her lil brother. We spent some time together afterwards and it became a very, very nice evening.  Speaking of which...for the hell of it...Here is another shot of  urlLink Orlando  from "Return of the King". Hehehe.  I hate to break it to the lot of you (thank you Pirates), but it does not look like I will be attending any classes this upcoming semester. I DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY!!! I cry when I think about it. Ok, so maybe not every time. But I did cry....Once...  I hate being poor. I bought the gifts I needed for gift exchanges, and that left me with a big fat nothing to buy anything for  urlLink Brenden.  We decided that we would celebrate our Christmas and exchange gifts on New Year's Eve. That gives me another week and one more payday. Wish me luck.  I want to give  urlLink Chris  a hug. I want to see, or at least hear him smile. There is so much that I envy about him, I just want him to be content. I hope he can find happiness in the months to come.  I want life to be easy. I want to learn something everyday. I want to feel astounded constantly. I want to mean something.  Progression would be good. I know.
