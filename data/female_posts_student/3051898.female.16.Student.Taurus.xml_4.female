My family is great (well, sometimes :P), my friends are great (I would prefer they were happier), Chris is great, I'm great.  urlLink Click here for a webpage that annoys Alison!  I find it funny though...  Alisons happy today which is nice, Louise is in quite a good mood (or at least was earlier), Chris is happy because he'sthinking about the house he's going to buy in the future (would be good if he really did have this house), I'm in a good mood because Chris makes me happy. Lol.  Tomorrow's my last day before I go on holiday... Which means I won't see Lauren for ages (I leave here on Saturday, she comes back here Sunday) and that I won't see Laura for ages and I wont see Alison for ages and I wont see Chris for ages. Would be nice to get a goodbye kiss off him but I don't think it's possible. Louise had a plan to get her mom out of the room but I don't think it will work out so perhaps we shouldn't bother. Firstly theres a good chance my dad will come with me into the house (if I say he can stay he'll prob be like, 'no i dont mind coming' argh), and secondly Louise probably won't get her mom out of the room for long (and Louise is gonna hate readin this, but I'd really prefer a goodbye snog....). Also even if the other stuff works out then Louise would be in the room with me and Chris. So I'd feel a bit weird kissing him with her there, and also she'd probably be upset for the rest of the day. Overall, (that word reminds me of history essays...argh) its probably not worth attempting. Pity really.  Well even without a goodbye kiss I'll probably be in a good mood, so I that means I don't need one! Wooo holiday in Spain! It'll be great, swimming everyday, Universal Medditerannia often, nearby neach, visiting Barcelona. Plus I'll be with 2 great friends, Louise and Stephen. It'll be great!!! So why aren't I actually that excited inside? :S Ah well. I'll enjoy it when I'm there.  Bye for now! (Tomorrow will probs be my last entry before holiday) ~Hannie xxx
