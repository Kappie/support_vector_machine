Real Age [ Tue May 13, 03:43:01 PM | Erin Trost | edit ]  What Is Your Dieting Personality?  Congratulations: You're an Individualist  You are likely to want the basics without a lot of rules and regulations. It's likely that you don't want to be told what to eat or how you should spend your POINTS. The more choices you have, the better you're able to stick with it. You also like experimenting with new things, which is great for preventing boredom.
