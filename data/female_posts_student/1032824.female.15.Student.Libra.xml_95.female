Sundays are wicked cos' your parents finally get a day off to spend time with the kids.   Anyways,  Christmas celebration  was marvellous. My family and I stayed home and had a scrumptious Christmas dinner YUMMY...  We watched The Christmas Wish and cracked up so badly.. And I suppose I could tell you about my Christmas pressies :P Mainly food la. Honey roasted almonds chocolate galore... Gosh! Haha.. There are like brownies, cookies, HEAPS of chocolates that could last me for years (*Teehee*), cool clothes from OP picked by my Mom and Dad! (*Huggles*) Earings, bracelets and stuff like that. I am so thankful for everything that I have received.   On the 26th, a buncha' NPCC peeps from my school and tss went to West Coast Park for a BBQ. It was ather amusing! Senior edwin brought twines along and made use of it when it started pouring by building a shelter with a canvas sheet. Glad am I that he was around! And thanks to Val and Xiongster for organising this activity! Thanks for all the presents too..  Yesterday was my Granny's 75th birthday and I had forgotten all about it until my lil' sister rang me up on my mobile. I had only 30 minutes to rush home before they leave the house and I was at bras brasah with my seniors. So I had to take a cab home. And.. *heaves a sigh of relief* I managed to reach home just in time. On a lighter note, my couzzie's girlfriend happens to be from ct as well. I think her name is Liting. Graduated last year. She's very amiable and angelic. :D I love being with my relatives. They are so easy-going and cranky, especially Auntie Enjaneek. *Muaks*   Take care everyone. Make good use of the remaining days of the holidays. Til then, xox.
