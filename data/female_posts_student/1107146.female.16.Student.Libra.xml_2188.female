I hope that you win this time around, Linds.  The officers that run the election had better be watched like hawks this time.  I wasn't loomed over in my booth, but if I had been, I would have cried foul immediately.  Voting is private, and you all know how I like my privacy.  Anyway, talk to most of you folkses tomorrow.  Hi, Abby!  ;)  ~ZZ
