OH yeah and at SITS i got sick BLAH and i kinda got in a fight with my friend and another friend....aw well we won't go into details....it's pretty much worked out so yeah....well after SITS i headed to Indy....i met a girl there...she was kinda weird but that's cool haha well then from Indy i went to Newton.....i had fun haha!!  SO lets talk about Newton! Well it's about time that i got pics of the guys haha! so i hope to get those developed soon. OK so i got to newton on tuesday and we went on a mule ride (it's kinda like a smaller jeep mixed with a four wheeler) and we kinda got in an accident....we were lookin for good trails right?! well we were by the corn fields and we hit a field ditch b/c we didn't see it well we were goin as fast as we could and we hit the ditch REALLY hard ah it was scary.we hit the ditch and went flying it was soo bad. i flew out of it upside down and i broke off a piece of the fiber glass with my knee so my knee was swollen my arm was swollen b/c of the bar and my shin was swollen b/c i hit the bar with it somehow....aw well i'll figure that out anyways richelle busted up her knee pretty bad too and we had to call donna to come get us haha it was funny afterwards. OK so after that we went to the fair where i saw Levi and Mason. I also got to hang out with Ryan and Riley a lil bit that night....man riley's grown up a lot since we hung out last. Well at the fair we washed and fed Donna's pigs it was nasty smellin haha!! Well then that night we went swimming and took a hot tub bath which it wasn;t hot b/c our parents used up all the hot water ARG then we went to the drive in and saw spider man 2 it was pretty good but ryan and riley kept callin us and that was no fun haha aw well. Then we went back to the fair around 2:30 am and brought the boys pillows and blankets b/c they were stayin there to watch te pigs! Well then Wednesday rolled around and Richelle went to work til around 4 and i talked to Bobby and made plans with him....richelle came home and got ready to go out with the DDD's and i went to bobby's softball game and then to his sister's house to hang out with him til around 11 that night then richelle picked me up and whoa was i in for a ride AHHH a very scary ride (haha bobby you know what i'm talkin about) i'm not goin into details on this one.....only certain people get to know about this one haha sorry!!  well then after all that jazzy stuff we came home and got into big trouble well me and riley didn't but Richelle did....aw well thats her problem....ok well then we all went to bed....then i woke up and found donna next to me which i had no idea she was there haha aw well she's cool!! well then we went Robinson to drop off my cousins that hanna had been playin with while we were in newton and we stopped by richelle's work in robinson....she was just fillin in...i got to see some REALLY REALLY hot pictures of Ryan Riley and Blake(their cousin!) then we headed home man it's about time i get to come home and sleep in my own bed haha!!
