I gave Leslie a ride home.  I came back, was getting out of my car when i decided i had to talk to erik.  he was just getting off.  So i drive down there.  And go talk to him- i say something like this     Erik, i dont know if there was something going on between us ( he nods his head yes and this is where i stopped)  Erik says.  yeah i like you a lot.  -this is where im thinkin ohh great, im going to hell for hurting a mormans feelings-  the rest is a little bit blurry so ill sum it up.   I say i think it would be cooler if we were just friends, and that i can see us having way more fun on a platonic level.  And he says.  yeah i was thinking about us and well youre going to be gone in a year and ill still be here ( like we'd still be together in a year) and i can see where you are coming from (hmm i really wasnt coming from there but ok)   So then he gets out of his truck and gives me a hug.  and we talk normal.  He goes Are you coming to my birthday shindig- yes.  And i said we were havin a little cabin get together (well knowing he wouldnt be able to come)  and you should come out.  And then i dont really remember stuff after that but then it goes something along these lines.  So you know what we have to do now.  And i said, no..... i have no idea.  (what was he geting at, i could not comprehend.... then it came)  Kiss.  I get to kiss you before you leave.  HOLY SHIT.   Who says shit like that right after theyve gotten the talk??? So what was i supposed to do?  run and hide?  well i didnt.  i closed my eyes.  and then it was over.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh What the fuck just happened!! Then he preceeded to give me another hug.  like i didnt feel dirty enough already.  Christ! So he says youre a good person and dont ever change and then i began to walk away.  And as he was driving by me he goes-  Now dont go home and cry about this. WTF.. seriously.  im still contemplating this whole situation!  He had to fuck with my mind.... AHHHhhh  what happens now.  Am i going to cringe everytime i see him... Arg.  Will i have to face his parents again?  eh... thats crazy i hope not!   And to make me seem more terrible than i already know i am, as soon as i got out of his sight i had to wipe my mouth off.... i was to disgusted.   when i was driving home i just felt gross and all i could think about were how bad his lips were chapped.  I guess he had worked for 8 hours or whatknot but hey. AHHHHHHH.  I'll be the only person in Le group to go to hell for messing with a mormon (not that i already wasnt going to hell for all the crazy things Le group has done) Ya know, he was probably the nicest guy that i would ever get and i sent him off packing.... just shows to go ya.   Oyyy i came home and just let out my frustrations.  thank god noone was here.  Then i talked to leslie and she calmed me down a bit- thanks guy!   im still kinda freaked out right now though.   I feel like i should be pacing back and forth, or verbally expressing how much i think Bush is an idiot and bears a striking resemblence to a monkey.   Aww maybe i should go to bed and tomorrow none of this will have happened.  No no.  i think i shower first and then i can go to bed clean.  then ill wake up and nothing will have happened.  yes good plan.  "I'm thankful that god is full of forgiveness." Until Time Next- when everything will be alright again
