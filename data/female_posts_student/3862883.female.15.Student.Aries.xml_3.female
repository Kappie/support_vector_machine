I don't think that Captain Willard really judged Kurtz. The reason that Kurtz thinksWilllard is judging him is because he has encountered men that wanted to kill him because they judge him as a lunitic. Which to me is what I think of him. He is so crazy he is not thinking straight and tohim everyone is judging him.Although whenKurtzsays, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have theright to judge me."Willardis sittingin sort of a daise as if he wasthinking about whatKurtzwas saying. Then that is when Kurtz thinks he is judging him. But Willardhad tohad been judging Kurtz because why else could he go through with his mission. The reasonWillard did kill Kurtz was because he kept on telling himself Kurtz is crazy and heneed tostop the darknessthat Kurtz has brought upon the people of the jungle and to himself.
