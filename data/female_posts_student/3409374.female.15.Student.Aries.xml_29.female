Lol...it's sad and yet...haiz...ti xiao jie fei. Sorry ar, pls pardon me...suddenly all the chinese idioms filling my head instead of bio. LoL. Today ms tan talked about respiration and how we breathe and about lactic acid being produced in our muscles. Made me feel like going for a run. But sick leh. Heehee...tt just an excuse, cos no motivations also. Today Andris gave us a wake-up call during esemble. Mentioned stuff about practising and attitude. Hey...i practise ok...lol...her words were so inspirational tt it caused me to practise just now. Words always have an effect on me. But i really hope it'll have an effect on some of the 1st vlns and 2nds as well, cos some of them really got attitude problem man. sigh. The fate of mgie lies in our hands. Wahahahas.
