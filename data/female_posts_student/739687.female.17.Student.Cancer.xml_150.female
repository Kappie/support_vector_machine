I feel bad for people who don't ever just LET GO. Have fun. Be crazy, and not always follow all the rules. That's what it's all about. Like my personal cliche goes, "Mistakes build character". I mean, I'd rather not be spoonfed morals and rules. I guess I'm big in to individualism and such. I have nothing against anyone's morals, but I just like living. I don't like being preached to either. Because then I don't really learn anything for myself. As goes another one of my personal cliches(maybe I have too many of these), "To experience life is to live it first hand...".  I'll leave it at that. Au revoir crazies.
