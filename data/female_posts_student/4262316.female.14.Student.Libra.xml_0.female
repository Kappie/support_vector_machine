My Response you dont know everything Henna ok? i Know youd like to think that, but oh well, you dont. you try and try to stay one step superior of everyone around you, but guess what? by doing that you sound stupid and patronizing. i  asked  your  advice.  on a problem i was having with a mutual friend. i didnt ask what my latest feeling was. you pass judgements on me based on little or no evidence. your all washed up hon and you know it.
