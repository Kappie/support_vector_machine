We climbed over the stupid fence that's like, 8 feet tall, and Erika was afraid to jump about 2ft from the trash can to the ground. She's not a very good partner in crime, but as Corey isn't here (and even if he was, he wouldn't do anything cause he's such a wimp about breaking rules) she's good enough. So I get inside and we decide it would be funny to put an orange cone on top of the shed...I don't know  why , but hey, come on- it's summer and we were super-bored. So it's up there and I am like, ok, that's waaay too noticable, so I try to step down, except Erika wasn't paying attention and forgot to sturdy the bin I was standing on. So I like, fall and this brick thingy lands on my leg and Erika starts laughing hysterically. So we are sitting there- cone on the roof, me being physically impared, and Erika making a ton of noise. So I am sitting there and going, "SHHHHH! ERIKA, shut up!" and then I was freaking out about the cone in case somebody saw it, and then Erika tries to hit it down with a mop and I am still stuck in the bricks, and then the crappy stuff is falling off the mop onto my face and we are freaking out. So eventually we fixed the situation, and we went back home.......to get tools. :-P   So we come home, get two phillips screw drivers, a monkey wrench, a hammer, and wire cutters. Instead of going in depth to all of our little 'adventures', heres a list:   -unhinging a shed door to see what's inside (i got bored and only followed half way through)  -carving initials into shed  -erika carving initials of who she likes into tree (not so bad)  -me puncturing the school's hose (hey, it's our tax money! and besides, Erika told me...:-P)  -Carving my initials into a fence  -both erika and I slashing 'z's into the screens (zorro theme!)   Yikes! I feel like a bad-girl. I love it! Total adrenaline rush...didn't know I was that way...Anywhoo...   Here are my results from quizzes today:     You represent... hope.
