I have no clue how that happened but it sure in the hell hurt my stomach. Hopefully, the pain will go away SOON.   Anyways, the whole no-stress-eating-anymore-thing really sucks. Especially when you hear your parents bitch about the money they had to spend while you were in the hospital. I mean hell, Am I suppose to feel bad because I'm trying to improve my health? Am I suppose to pay them back? What? I don't get it. I never said they had to pay for 5 nights of hotel - They had every option to come home and just leave me at the hospital. Heck, at this point I kinda wish they had because it's sure in the hell not fair to throw this in my face 3 weeks after surgery.  It'll get better soon, I'm sure as long as its not about money. BLAH!
