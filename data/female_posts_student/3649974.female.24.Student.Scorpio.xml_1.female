Does any other female in the universe have this problem? A man that she has to practically beg to get sex from?  SOOO fucking annoying.  He used to tell me how amy would bitch cuz he wanted sex everyday.  Yeah that makes me feel real great.  When he was with her, he wanted sex everyday, with me he want's it like once a month.    It honestly makes me feel like there's something wrong with me.  First there's something so wrong with me that no one can love me, and now i have to beg for sex. AND what's with the you can just give me oral! ARGH! WTF! who the hell does he think he is! AAAARRRRGGGGHHH!!!!!
