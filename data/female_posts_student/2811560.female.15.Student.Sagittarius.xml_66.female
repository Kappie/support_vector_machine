Or rather, she spent, it didn't cost me anything, lol. I got a few shirts, a skirt and pink capris. Nice. Most of the stuff we bought was for my Mom. But yeah, anyways, I didn't end up going to Pyde's. Jasmine was grounded and I was relying on her for a ride. That and I just didn't really feel like going. I called the freshmen about marching band today. One trombone wasn't home, another is going to a Carol Stream school. The other trombone, a girl, was doing swimming. So far we're 0 for 3. Then I called the baritone and left a message. Hopefully he'll come because we REALLY need baritones. We'll see. Tomorrow we have to go to church early, and then we're going out to brunch for Mother's Day. It kinda sucks because I'd rather sleep, but I can't complain because its Mother's Day. I guess I'll just have to to tough it out, lol.
