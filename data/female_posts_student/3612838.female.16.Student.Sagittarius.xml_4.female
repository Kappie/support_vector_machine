It's been the most awaited part of my grade 10 life next to my graduation day but anyway lets not talk about that yet coz its still July and as I've said, "Lets live with the present, and be aware of reality." Sounds jerk but I don't want a life fu;ll of fantasy anymore. I'm tired and frustrated of getting myself to dream all the time. But anyway, for sure, I'm graduating this March and well, yes, maybe, I could still be a top student. It's hard, but, "Kakayanin ko to!"   So I'll take you to my diary. Here's the entry I wrote yesterday after I got back from Don Bosco Retreat House.   First, here are the basic facts of the event:     What:  Grade 10 Righteousness retreat     When:  July 24-25, 2004     Who:  Grade 10 Righteousnes girls     Where:  Don Bosco Retreat House     Companions:  Mdm. Gallur and Mdm. Bacalso         Sunday, July 25    In my Room        Its been hours since weve finished the retreat and even at this point, I can't help myself but be nostalgic about all the things that has occured in my life over the weekend. It was just next to purr-fect!        We barely spent 48 hours straight company with each other but I just don't know what's with our class' aura and why I think, all of us think, were so irresistible to love!!! Haha!        I mean, you know, let me just bring you back first and foremost to our retreat house's wondrous milieu.The place was too perfect for reflection. An ever conducive place for reflecting brimming with lush towering plants. It was all but good.        Yesterday, the climax of our retreat was the Circle of Love. Bucketful of tears filled the hall but never was a hint of regret found in the hearts of every Righteousnessian in saying sorry and asking for forgiveness. We practically loved telling and showing our friends how much we cared for them. In other words, those were just tears of love and joy.        Mdm Bacalso and Mdm Gallur were with us together in our crying moments. They were very concerned of us and we can't believe how we got them to love and care for us so much. They're such exemplary teachers who never gets tired of doing everything to lead us unto the right path. They're 2 of the best teachers we love so mucho!        What event got me practically nostalgic and ever wistful was our slumber together. First time to do such crazy stuffs. Eat, tell ghost stories, share our views on icebreaker cards, share funny moments and laugh at each other's quirks and idiosyncracies. I finally found friends whom I enjoy much of their company- they're the ones who pioneered in the "cute phenomenon" and I don't understand as to what kind of heavenly body fell over me and why I suddenly found myself one day wanting to partake in such crazy "name calling". Haha, I bet, coz its "CooL".        It was a pleasure to get to know the reality of a person's core behind her superficial facade. I learned something about this today and that is that: each and everyone of us have all but the same needs- the need to be accepted and to belong. But sometimes things get pretty overwhelming and thats when others who fail to fulfill their quota of self advocacy would resort to pathetic far-out self-customizing. And it would appear like their very own self is what you see but its none at all..        Like some act numb when deep inside they're already hurting and others seem to appear strong and invincible while the truth is they're crushing deep down. Well, we really dont know. Who knows? While some act mean or so diabolic even, but the truth is, they actually have the heart of a marshmallow.        Sometimes or oftentimes, its hard to figure out people. They're practically the most intricate species to decipher. They're filled with so much wrapskins but actually, the truth behind their facade remains lurking behind and until you can uncover them slowly by getting to know them better.        People are intrinsically complex. But it makes even more the so-called human psychology and sociology more interesting to talk about.        The verdict here?    Don't ever judge a book by its cover. Get to know a person first before jumping into conclusions, coz chances are, what you merely see is less than what's really inside. Get to know people and love them! If you could do such, then you finally found the most interesting kind of undertaking available on earth..haha....or so I said. ;P
