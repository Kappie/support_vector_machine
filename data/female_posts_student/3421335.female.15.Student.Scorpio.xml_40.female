Said the things that will soothe the soul  When the flames goes out  Cause you poured cold water  Didn't you wish you've never done that?  Or at least pour fuel instead.  When the flames goes out,  Did you ever wish that the wind never came  Didn't you wish you would protect it  That the dying flames wasn't your fault  When the flames goes out,  Would you wish that it would fade away thinking of you Or maybe just it knows that you cared and it meant something to you  That it would leave feeling loved  When the flames goes out  Don't you think that it went out too soon  Or maybe you could say or do something to make it stay  That it knew that someone needed them  When the flames go out,  Don't you think that its useless to think about it  Or try to make things change because of a mistake  It'll work, don't give up, cause you can stop other flames from going out
