I phoned Laura and just before the person picked up the phone the computer says "I think it's you bosoms" (Now doesn't that look like the wrong spelling?) Really loud cause my brother set it to say that and her Grandma picked it up! Whoops! I'm not sure if she heard it though! Lol! Music to listen to at the moment is Shut the door by the Mad Caddies! Cause I'm always telling people to shut the door and I'm a bit obsessed with it! Hehe! I'll just go crawl into a hole now!
