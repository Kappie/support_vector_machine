I just want a place to hide.  I love being around my cousins, they make me laugh, and well, they're just cute.  And their mom (my older cousin) has always been someone that I love to girl talk with.  Now, as for the elders (minus my uncle, because he's just friggin' awesome) I could do with just talking to them for like, 20 minutes.  I think I may have to hide from my Grandma.  The last time that I was with her for a long time (vacay in the Port Aransas) she drove me crazy.  Those of you whom I speak to often know why.  I just sorta don't want to be around on Friday.  I wish that my cousins weren't coming here and that I was just going to go over there and spend the whole day there.  Oh well.  Where did this erupt from?  Well, I have no school on Fridays... my final is tomorrow.  I casually mentioned that I may wanna sleep in... like... without being woken up by anyone or an alarm.  I got my head bit off because I should be up for when the early birds (the old people) get here.  Jeez... is it too much to ask to sleep in til 10 am?  That's the latest I can sleep in anyway.  I just want to sleep til 10.  Oh well... Other than that, I'm doing good.  I'm going to get an A in my class.  There's no way for me to get less than that now... I could even not study, get a 7 out of 30 on the test and still get an A.  :-)  Comforting.    Let's see... oh yes.  The dreaded ex has been around again.  That's... interesting.  When I say around, I don't mean physically... I mean... via internet and telephone.  Hmmm... really not much else going on.  Oh, I most likely have a job lined up for the Fall and Spring semesters.  I had an interview with San Antonio Urban Ministries.  They're a non-profit organization that has a program called After School Kare (ASK) at several Northside schools.  So, if I get the job, I'll be working someplace very close to the UT-SA 1604 campus.  I even have a UNIFORM for this job.  And the plus is that I won't have to change diapers!  :-)  Anyhow, I'll post once I hear something about that.  More later...
