See, Wednesday I stayed home from work with a sore throat and mild hangover.  I figured that the two were maybe a little related, but when my throat didn't feel better by that afternoon, I made a visit to the Baylor Medical Center (completely different from its more prestigious and accurate cousin in the Metroplex).  They assured me that I did not have strep throat, or anything, for that matter, and sent me on my merry way.  Yesterday, after returning to work, I came home so exhausted that I fell asleep at 8pm.  When I woke up at 12:30 this afternoon, I had a message from the Baylor Medical Center confirming two of my suspicions:  first, that I do, in fact, have strep throat, and second, that they are a bunch of idiots.  My first thought was, who the fuck gets strep throat in June?  I've always associated being sick with winter, since it's the crappiest season anyway, and plus when I was a kid I always had strep throat when it was cold.  I just guessed that germs love inclement weather.  Then I figured out that I probably got sick from my non-illness related visit to the doctor last Friday, where I shared a waiting room with lots of little snot-nosed kids who breathed all around me.  This reinforced two more beliefs of mine: A. I hate going to the doctor's office, and B. Nor can I stand screaming, snotty, disease-ridden children.    So I drove *back* to campus to pick up some drugs, which will allegedly make me feel good enough to go back to work Monday, but not good enough to float the river tomorrow.  Damn.  But leaving the house was a good thing, because I took the long way home and picked up some of the mother of all comfort foods, Taco Bueno.  It doesn't matter what you order, it's all excellent.  Plus, since my appetite has been nonexistent the past couple of days, I'm going to look at this as a weight-loss opportunity (everyone knows that calories from Taco Bueno don't count).  However, I decided that no matter how sick I am, I'm still glad that I'm not Sabrina this weekend.  Because while I lay on the couch and whine, eat greasy Mexican food, and watch the Law and Order marathon that's on USA, she's completing her warp-speed thesis to turn in Tuesday.  Sending good thesising vibes her direction...
