When I was younger I used to get cravings for salami and carrots! Mind you, they were damn good carrots! I'm also more awake in the evening than in the morning, I'm really lazy when I get up. I also should be doing homework right now... Whoops. Oh well, probably only some Spanish stuff or something! Umm I should probably also be doing several other things simultaneously at this moment, but hell, Blogger needs me! Well... not so much as blogger needing me, but me needing blogger! Ahh I get dangerous if I can't write my thoughts down, too many, it gets cluttered in my small mind. It's good to record your thoughts I guess, then you have proof that you're sane (or not). Hehe... sanity. I have weird way of linking things though so maybe it's not too good for me to share my thoughts! But Blogger is good, hey, if it keeps you sane as a kitten it's got to have worked hasn't it! *shameless plug*
