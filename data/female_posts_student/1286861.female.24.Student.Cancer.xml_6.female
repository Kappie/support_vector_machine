Let me fill everyone in on what I happen to know thus far.  My mom, older sister Jamie and I were at the hospital till late Friday morning. Evidently my mom wasn�t even informed of the accident till 2 or 3 late Wednesday afternoon. At first I thought there was something wrong with this, but the more I thought about it I realized I was in a safe place, getting my medication and being taken care of. Those three things I have nothing wrong with. I am afraid I am not sure I remember anything till late Friday afternoon, so either way; we are good on all fronts.  Having the advantage of being me, I kind of know what is going on in said body. The top of my left thigh is sparsely covered in bruises and somehow my left eye looks as if someone has beat it in. Along with the bruising on the eye, there is a 3 inch gash right under my left eyebrow. How any of this happened, I am still unsure. My mother and I have a meeting with the police officers handling the case on Monday, and hopefully we can get some questions answered. I do know for sure that my car will be no more, and according to what we uncover with the police on Monday, we will find out if I can even look into getting another one. Boy is it great to be me right now!  I will keep everyone up to speed on the happenings and hopefully, I have lived my life well enough to this point to hope for some gentle relief in the happenings to come. I would appreciate anyone�s wishes or prayers. Thanks everyone, you know how to get a hold of me if you need�looks as if I will have plenty of time nowadays!
