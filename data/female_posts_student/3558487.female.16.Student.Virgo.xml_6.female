For our one year we wanted to eat at Melting Pot, but we were poor cuz it was around prom time, so we decided we would eat there yesterday instead. Oh, the food was so good, and we had a lot of fun. As a matter of fact, i think i still feel full from last night.   The only bad part was that i guess people thought no one else could hear them talking, (cuz the booths are really secluded) and they kept talking about being high all the time, and this other little kid said that his mom was stupid cuz she was canadian. It was kinda funny.  Today, i have the exciting and wonderful flute party... hopefully it will be just that, exciting and wonderful...  I guess i'll go and be productive... and thanks you guys for your supportive comments... but, melissa, i'm beginning to think you comment on MY blog more than you update yours... hehe... and leah, i wouldn't know about your blog because my computer won't let me read it cuz it has bad words i guess.   LOVE,  LISA  Song: "Baseball" - Ozma  (or other songs from the album 'Rock and Roll Part Three')
