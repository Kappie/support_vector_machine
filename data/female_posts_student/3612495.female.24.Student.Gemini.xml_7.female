On Friday, its the first time he scold me, actually, he had drunk, I felt strange, but on that time, I known I need to stay besides him much more to look after him, I cant leave him, I cant leave him alone, he will be much more pity. You should remember, every time, every moment, I will be thinking of you.  今日我開始在網上寫日記，因為我希望我的朋友可以跟我一齊分享我的喜與憂。 上個星期五，他第一次罵我，也不算罵，只是大聲一點的，因為他飲醉左。但好奇怪，那一刻，我更加覺得我要在他的身邊照顧佢，我唔可以離開佢，唔可以只剩下他一個，佢會好可憐的。你要記住，無論何時、何地，我個心都係想住你的。
