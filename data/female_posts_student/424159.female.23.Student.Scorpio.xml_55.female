My old blog and blog archives are lost. I guess I should not lose heart and just restart my Blogger. I apologize to all who were looking forward to routine updates: I've just been too lazy this summer to blog.   In all truthfullness, the silence of my Blog this summer is representitive of the quiet and boring summer I've had. I've just been working a lot (40+ hours a week) and not really much of else. I went to Dayton a few times to visit Sara and even made it to Portsmouth once. All in all, my summer was pretty decent. Could it be the calm before the storm? I start X-Ray school in 12 days, and I can only imagine my life will be turbulent for a while.   A few other points of interest:   Jake turned 16 on Sep 9. Happy Birthday.  My roomie brought home a kitten! Too adorable.  We succesfully moved into our new apartment a couple of weeks ago.   I can't really think of anything else that's worth sharing right now, so I'll close this out, hoping to get back into the blog of things.
