We were a really fun class to be with. Specially since we have ben with the same ppl for at least 3 yrs cuz of T.A.G (talented and gifted). Its basically a class for advanced students and they get tought above grade knowledge. We were all suppose to be getting straight A's or honor roll .....hahahahahahaha well some ppl did, i did in 7th and 6th grade but then 8th grade i got some C's so no honor roll for me:( . Not a lot of kids got honor roll. I think the ones who did were,juliet,jessica,corey,shanae,and anisa and in 6th and most of 7th grade me.. 5 outta about 19. We were all smart but some of us were just plain lazy. In some ways we were united. All the teachers with the exception of ms.buck(gym teacher) basicallly hated us. But deep inside i know they liked having us around. There wasnt a day that the class didnt have a good laugh during some class. I know i didnt, me and ester and sometimes shanae(my best friends) would always have something to laugh at ,specially during lunch time. (anisa...armando...shanae..if ur reading this u know what im talking about). I came to T.A.G in 6th grade, so i was with them for 3 yrs. To get in to TAG, u have to get good grades and then take this test if u pass then u get in. I say all were good times, there were a couple fights and some bitching in the classroom and some misunderstanding within our nitch. I will miss all of the ppl in class even those who i sometimes despised. Like for example, peter who kinda smelled and was a really weird kid, he was sometimes nice and he was very good with vocabulary(very very very good). LOL and those times that he flipped , man that was scary . Oh yeah and when he fought with corey, lol omg, wont get those images outta my mind. And Keith(did i spell it right?) who i thought was soo inoccent and came to find out that he was looking girls butts 24/7, I guess i can understand y he notice them a lot, i mean hes short enough to reach them lol. alright alright, sorry keith for calling u short. Let seee......o yeah theres corey, corey corey corey, u big mouth, always seems to have something silly to say and alwyas getting in trouble. He flirts a lot too. Armando......well i guess ur an example of "if u dont succeed try and try again", good luck with anisa, and stop saying "ok" "kk" all the time..sheesh! Aneysa(other anyesa) ashely,mahagoni(or however u spell her name) and xianne, all u guys are funny in ur own weird cruel mysterious ways. Even though sometimes u did get on my nerves. Dominique....theres only want thing to say about u and i know a lot of ppl say the same thing......BITCH i know i know, it does sound mean but after the way she acted all these past 3 yrs, tats all i got to say. Deep deep deep, very deep inside of her i know theres a nice person. Ester.... my partner in crime, we always had a fun time together, whether it was laughing our way through lunch cuz someone slipped or playing jokes on ppl and ourselves, or throwing crumbled up papers at our classmates, we always seemed to get the best outta life. LOL remeber the time in languge art class when we didnt have our homework so we handed in some other papers with a total different subject on it, and we still got a good grade for handing it in. lol, those were the times. OH and i will always remeber the times that we went to the library and looked and flirt with cute guys, lol, specially victor, the cute library guy. And i hope the teachers in high school dont have huge butts like some that we experienced. specially with MS.Paulson, she would always bend down o help someone and then her ass was on the face on whoever was behind her.Im glad were going to the same high school. Shanae, my weird crazy friend,who ppl thought was posessed by a demond,cuz of ur glowing red eyes when u got really mad. And u also know how to dance very good. You,ester and me were the like the 3 musketters......GIRL POWER,LOL W/E. Such great memories, but too bad that ur going to another high school, 3 musketeers wont be complete in high school without u. i hope we keep in touch. Juliet.....man someitmes ur a pain in the ass, and u can be very stuck up. You are a nice person sometimes, but other times i jut feel like cursing u out. Stop trying to be so god damn popular and crap, its just gonna mess with ur head, even thought its already kinda messed up right now.To tell u the truth because u acted so stuck up u lost ur best friend ester, cuz u ditched her for jessica. Jessica i kinda dont know u cuz u came kinda late, but i can tell u to make up ur mind about franklin, either u love him or u dont. And whats all those rumors about u going to juliets house and u and franklin would lock ursleves in her room, thats just freaking weird girl. Stephanie.....ur a very very good friend, ur always there for ur friends and ur a very strong person,i dont think i could go through the things u have gone through. I really hope hat we still keep in touch and keep being the nice, funny person that u r. Anisa....ur weird!!!!! and good at basketball, its cuz of u that i joined in cuz i was kinda scared, but thanx to u i got the courage to, thanx for being a good friend and for always helping me when i needed help. Hope to keep in touch. Teresa, wow ur something rnt u, but what i dont understand y u would loose a friendship over a boy, y u were mad at anisa, just cuz armando liked her. U shouldnt be like that. I also think that ur not as shy as i frist met u. im glad u finally know how to stand up for urself and not take shit from no one. And last but not least me......my goals for high school is to get my grades up again so i can get a scholarship, to be a friend to everyone and be more adventurous and risk taking. I also need to conquere my shyness, im not too shy but i want to be a little less shy. I think i will be remebered to my friend as the crazy silly girl.Im glad i met all of those ppl up there, it helped me to see that i will be dealing with different types of ppl in my life and that i need to to cope with everyone.Or at least try to.
