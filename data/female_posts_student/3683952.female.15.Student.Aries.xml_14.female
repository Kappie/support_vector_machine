Suddenly like very serious like that. Its like the only time i feel happy is during cg and when i'm servin. On sat went for SYF. its really very fun de.. really enjoyed myself durin the whole thing. Only when go home the time i lyk beri moody seh.... think cauz very tired. den during training the time quite alot of things happen... Sometimes its better for u to know less. so dun ask so much. the more u know, the more misunderstandings there will be. just leave it alone. and keep your hands off it. GO AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LEAVE ME ALONE!!! juz playin. (like real) ok. feel bit better.  My source (bro. kc and sis. gloria):  Here is my life Lord Jesus   All I have I give to you   Youâ€™re my God and my saviour   You make all things new      My life is on the altar   I give my heart to you  In you i've found my purpose   My reason for living is you      You are my source and my salvation   Nothing compares to you   All of my days, I long to know you more    Holy Spirit pour down like water   Hungry for your touch   Each breath I take, I give my all to you      Your words are life eternal   To whom do I go besides you   My dreams and my desires   I lay them at your feet      Jesus I give you all     All that I am is yours  - *with his love* -
