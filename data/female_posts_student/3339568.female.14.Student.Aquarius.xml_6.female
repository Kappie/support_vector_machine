Hannah missed her first bus and was stranded at Chatswood while some hobo chased her round saying "Help me find my family! I've lost them!" Haha, would only happen 2 Hanni.... Casey, being the lazy bum she is, slept in and didn't get round 'till 10.30! We had 2 giv her a wake up call. And we pranked her house and left a message on the answering machine saying,  "Hello, this is Dr. Al-Ka-Sher-Ba from the pregnancy clinic, and we have Mr. B Hinde's test reults. (KC's bro) Could you please call back as soon as possibe on 9451 8117. Thanks!"  Once both parties arrived, we basically did, well nuthing!! We had the music up very loud tho. Taking full advantage of Foxtel digital by using their new radio channels. :D And we went onto sum randoms blog and told him Casey wanted 2 go out with him. And we successfully managed 2 cut off a lock of Casey's hair!! Excellent... Then came the infamous pizzas....  We decided 2 order pizzas, and Hannah called up hoping 2 speak 2 Dougie, but she got sum random ass lady, who said,  "That will be $17.20. Thanks! Bye!"   And hung up, while we stood there baffled, because it was only 'sposed 2 be $14.95 and we didn't have enuf money. So we spent the next half an hour trying 2 figure out how 2 get $2 (possible solutions - sell lemonade, sell hannahs fone, beg, busk, ask pizza guy 2 let us off $2 because our dog had died and finally, to sell casey) Eventually I just put in sum of mi Noumea money. SO neway, the pizza guy was realli late, and Casey goes,  "Wouldn't it be funni if your Mum came home right now!"  She jinxed it!! Then about 2 seconds later, mi Mum drove down the driveway, while the pizza guy was following the car (we weren't realli allowed 2 order pizza we don't think) So we're like  "Shit, she's home!"  And KC and Hanni ran into mi room 2 hide, and so i went outside 2 face the music, and the pizza guy had disappeared!! Like totally vanished. So Mum had come home from school just 2 put out the washing, and we were offering 2 help her, 2 get her out of the house quickly, but she wouldn't let us. She ended up going tho! Finally! We got away with it! So the pizzas STILL hadn't arrived and there was the mystery of the missing pizza dude. We could hear his motorbike in the background. So Hanni called up the lady 2 complain. And she's like  "Blah, Blah, Blah, I don't care!"  and so we hung up, and then the doorbell rang and it was the pizza guy, and to Hanni's dismay, he wasn't hot. He was like 60 and ugly! He denied he got lost when KC asked him, but we think he was lying just 2 save face! :P So we ate our pizzas, forcing ourselves to eat 5 pieces each!! Ahhh, we were like bursting!! So that was mi fun day with KC and Hanni! :O We had fun and we were doing nuthing! Yay! Dats what friends r 4...
