It's a big carnival/amusement park that comes every summer for about 2 weeks and the last time I went was about 6 years ago so I was really excited about it.  We went on EVERY one of the crazy rides... oh God it was fabulous.  There was this one called the Space Roller and I'm not going to try to explain this ride because I've already attempted to three times and it just doesn't work with text.  I had a hard enough time trying to explain it to my mum where I could TALK and use hand movements so this will get me nowhere.  I will just say though that it was the most insane and ridiculous ride ever and I went on it twice!  Yay.  Three things I learned while being there: 1. DO NOT buy Deluxe Candy Apples.  I bought the one with Smarties becuse hey, it looked tasty but I was very wrong.  The apple WAS somewhere deep in there but it was covered in this red, sugar candy coating stuff that was hard and plastic-like and I felt like I was trying to chew glass.  I ended up throwing it away because it was just too messy.  2. When carnies try to sweet talk you, they're really trying to just get you to pay for their game... I knew that before but last night really proved to me that.  3. I'm in love with Sam Roberts.  Hehe.  Okay not LOVE but he and his band put on such an amazing show.  He's much better live than on the album and I think that says a lot right there. Oh and look, here he is:     So all in all, it was a great day despite the horrible mosquitos and the heat.  Oh man it was hot out.  Today, I slept in till noon which was nice because I had no sleep the previous night due to my mind just not shutting up.  I'm going to make the most of these beautiful summer days before I start working, so it will include sleeping in, watching cartoons whilst I have breakfast, hanging out with people in the afternoons and possibly seeing movies as well as record shopping.  Yay!  I saw The Terminal today. The good: Tom Hanks, as always, was brilliant.  I just love him. Stanley Tucci was also good.  He's always good as the bad guy.  The bad: Catherine Zeta Jones was terrible.  I found that she and Tom Hanks had no chemistry whatsoever and her attempt at an American accent was just over the top.  The storyline was lame and didn't really go anywhere.  Overall: It sucked and isn't even worth renting.  Canada Day tomorrow!!  I'll be going to see the fireworks!  WOOH!
