I don't know what name is going to show up at the bottom of this entry, but here, in my own pathetic virtual creation of where I most with I was (and where I am so far away from), I will go by my Hawaiian name, that is, what my name would be if I had a Hawaiian name. I actually have no Hawaiian roots, just a cheap canvas souvenier bag with cute little glitter and sequence and a drawing of a beautiful Hawaiian native resting on the beach. I stare at my bag a lot and think "If only I could make that come to life..." then all would be well in my world.     I desperately need a vacation if you hadn't noticed.     To give a little background information, I am twenty-three; a scorpio, a student, a mother, a wife, a daughter, and my life is TRAGIC. :-) I will brag about my collegiate accomplishments a lot here, and you will eventually grow weary of it and think to yourself, "Shut up, bitch. It's not like you're at Harvard!" And you will be absolutely correct. I will post stories about how this or that thing moved me to tears and all of the deep and heavy emotions this or that thing inspired in me, and no one else could possibly understand this or that thing because I am a complex and mysterious snowflake who just can't be understood. I will speak ambiguously of my family and numerous familial problems, because, after all, this is the Internet, and anyone can read a blog.     I am interested in reading, writing, dreaming, and one day visiting some other non-tropical parts of the globe, like Thailand or Russia. I like proper use of capital letters and punctuation. I have an addiction to M I don't like it when people say "ergo" instead of "therefore." I like Malibu Rum and drinks that come with little pink umbrellas or cherries on a plastic sword.
