And the relationship between easy money and earned money seems to be very complicated. I can't even remember the times I haven't read tabloids about how winning a lottery ruined someone's life: preassure of spending the money became heavier, jealousy among friends and family became unbearable, the good life suddenly turned into bad. If you had money, why to keep your job and not give it to someone who needed it more? Why not turn into a slob, and overly giving and used person because you happened to beat the odds of winning, randomly?  Thinking what too much money would bring makes you wonder if you want to get all the cons that come with the pros. I sometimes buy a lottery ticket, if my small studentaid money from the government allows to be stretched even that little. I never win. Anything at all. I often dream what I would do with the money if I won. So do most finns. Most people, including me, probably wouldn't even want to win the jackpot. Just some, so they didn't have to struggle so much and count every penny to make ends meet, or to improve their life just a little. And I'm the first to admit that there are many other people even in our so called welfare country who would need the money much more desperately than I do.  So why is the idea of money, especially a lot of money, so controversial? It's adored and desired and appreciated, but at the same no one really wants it... or admits to wanting it. The answer to that, I believe, is as complex as human mind and thinking altogether.  What comes to me.... I want to keep dreaming.... "what would I do if someday...."  Getting what I want, would destroy the joy of dreaming and a hope of the better.
