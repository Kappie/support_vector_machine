Yesterday was the first meeting and they had us separate into groups, if you ran more than 4 miles you go with one group if not you run a mile on the track.  My brother and I ran with the 4 mile group, we ended up doing 2 miles.  My brother and I started of with the 8 min milers.  I was a little nervous since I am not as fast, but went along with the crowd.  I kept up with my brother like usual unitl a mile and half.  He ran two miles in 19:45 (or close to it) I ran it in 20:09.  In order for us to be in the same pace group I neeeded to run it under 20 min.  Oh well, Just like Richard said, "you'll be meeting twice the runners, twice the potential partners for an informal run-together, twice the number of names and faces to greet at local races."   I am excited to see who is in my pace group I am hoping for some "runners" but for some reason I feel like I am with the "walkers".  I guess we will see next saturday!   Enjoy your runs, runs end but running doesn't
