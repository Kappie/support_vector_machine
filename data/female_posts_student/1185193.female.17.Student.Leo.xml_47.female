It is also an interesting, air-conditioned place to hang out during the maddening heat of summer.  However, the cons overwhelmingly outweigh the pros.  Especially today.  After doing lunch with my mom at The Old Spaghetti Factory and getting fingerprinted for my Vacation Bible Camp position, I decided to drive over to Valley Fair.  I was hot and cranky and the mall tends to be cool and peaceful.  So I went there hoping to reverse my mood and to buy a yoga mat and strap (long-needed).    I always park in the same parking garage and the same level.  This time was no different; I parked, entered the mall, window shopped for a bit, bought my yoga gear, and decided to head on home.  Except there was one problem:  I was lost.  I had no clue where I was and where the correct parking garage was from my location.  I  wandered aimlessly for several minutes before I spied a security guard.  I thought,  Okay, Megan, just ask him where the garage you parked in is...No, it's not weird, he won't think you're too dumb .  The encounter carried out like this:  M:  Excuse me.  I seem to be lost.  Do you know where the parking structure walkway to the roof by Macy's is from here? SG: Which Macy's?  Men's or women's? M:   (Crap.  I have no clue.)   Umm, I'm not quite sure.  I just know I saw Express when I came in. SG:  There's a  men's Express and a women's Express.  Which one was it? M:   (CRAP!)   I didn't seem to notice. SG:  Well, which street did you turn in from?  Monroe?  By Forest Avenue?  Between the two banks? M:   (How am I supposed to know?)   Umm, I don't know. SG chuckles and says:  Well, young lady.  You don't seem to know much of anything. M:  (Wow,  I'm thoroughly embarrassed!)   You know what?  I think I can handle it from here.  Thanks anyways.   Sure enough, I found the walkway--much later as I hobbled from the blisters my expensive Gap shoes inflicted on my pinky toes.  For future reference, I noted that it was by both the  women's  Macy's and Express.  In conclusion, I hate Valley Fair because it is simply too big.  And confusing.  And I don't like it.
