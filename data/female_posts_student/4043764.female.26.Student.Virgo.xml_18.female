I slept well, of course, with my windows open and huddled in my comforter. I guess it's good that I associate deep thinking and academic success with cold, depressing weather, because I sure as hell would not be able to start school in a month.  So far, nothing interesting to report, other than the fact that our kitchen floor is being held up only by some jacks and poles. The landlord has set up an electric burner and all kinds of other stuff for our "convenience" but I can't really see myself doing a lot of cooking in our makeshift kitchen. Perhaps this attitude will change once I begin bonding with the roommates.  I spent all day yesterday re-discovering my winter wardrobe, my books and my ridiculous decorating sense (I threw together some prints from my travels, and while everything looks appropriately "exotic" it also looks like I might be colorblind).  I met the landlord, who owns an antique plumbing business here. He has a penchant for wearing sunglasses, a hat, shirt tucked into a belted pair of shorts that are hiked up to his chest. This guy, with his Irish name and fashion sense, screams BOSTON. He says to me, "So are you going to [insert school name that sounds funny with a Boston accent - it's got a couple of "r's" in it]". "Yep." "Well, good for you. Good for you." I look at him, but his eyes are hidden by those highway patrolman sunglasses. I cannot tell if there is a particular reason that this is "good for me" but I just try to keep the chat alive. "I guess so." "Whatchoo studyin' over there?" "Anthropology." "Now, that's dinosaurs and stuff, right?" Damn, that Ross and his Friends. People now think all anthropologists and paleontologists are the same damn people. I pretend that I know something about anthropology. I honestly know little and hope that no one figures it out when I start classes. "Well, no I am looking at cultures. People." "Oh. Like ancient cultures and people?" "No, current cultures and people." Confused silence. Landlord's mouth is slightly open. "I'm gonna bring that electric two-eye stove over tonight or tomorrow. See how that works for you." *** I wished I had more to report, other than the fact that I am beginning to have the kinkiest, explosive boy dreams that I've ever had. No idea what that's about - my subconscious working out the sexual tension and issues between us? Perhaps. Or maybe I just need a little somethin' to get me over this once and for all. In my mind, I've been preparing for the real *end* for a long time (you would think the new girlfriend would have made that a lot easier, but noooooo), but there is this something that keeps me hanging on... Closure. I need to make it for myself.  Anyway, I think he is supposed to do his five-week trip to Congo and Angola starting this weekend. He told me that it would be the perfect opportunity to work out his issues, to be away and think about what he wants. Right. In the mean time he will be avoiding confrontation with the new lady - her majesty, her royal cluelessness. And probably with me, who knows what I am in his life... I know what you're thinking - who cares? It's just not that simple.
