You paid for that course and I think you deserve to be given a chance to take that test.  If I were you, I will speak to the 6 other people who couldn't take the test and just complain about that teacher.  It obviously isn't your fault that you were stuck in traffic.  Someone needs to pop that teacher's bubble so he'll realize that the world doesn't evolve around his class alone.  Take care and I hope you'll find a solution to your dilemma
