My mother just opened the bag of dry cat food to discover a gigantic horde of shiny brown roaches crammed into it, huddled together in a solid mass. It was with grim pleasure that she dragged the scrabbling bag outside and banished the wee beasties into the gorge. They ran like rats fleeing a sinking ship as she spanked the bag.  BWAHAHAHAHAHA! Roaches, flee for your lives! We are free at last!
