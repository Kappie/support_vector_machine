Mondays I go to school, Wednesdays and Fridays I go to school then off to work, Tuesdays and Thursdays I got to work most of my day. I usually come home tired but attempt to do homework until I get bored, eat Dinner then log on to the internet to see if Jesse is there and talk to him the rest of the evening, until I go to sleep or he tells me to go to bed. That’s pretty much it, usually. Today is the exception. After work I am walking to catch Light rail and going to my Sister’s house. We are going to take a picture of her, my brother and I and then have it developed and framed for our mom for mother’s day. That was the only thing she wanted this year (although I did order her a nice little rose bush for mother’s day, it’s getting delivered tomorrow). She is going to be so surprised.  In other news, Jesse went to Camp Doha yesterday, I thought it was for some training, but he said it was just to pick up a mini-frig for his work area. I asked him to case the place and see if it really was as nice as I have heard it was. I hope to get to talk to him tonight when I get home from Angela’s. I sure do miss him a lot. I just wish that the time would go by faster and that he was on his way home already. I can’t wait until he gets to come home on leave, it will be so nice to see him again. I just hate being away from him this long. I know that when he come back on leave I wouldn’t get to keep him, but 2 weeks is so much better than nothing, right?  I sure hope that his trip to Doha went ok... I hate those convoys, even if he is in Kuwait.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I wrote a poem today.   Sheltered Heart”  Written by Danielle Chidester 5/5/2004   It sure is dark down there 	I can hardly see a thing I wonder why no light shines in 	Why darkness is all that is seen  Never to see the light of day 	Or the greenness of the grass Never to see kites on strings 	Or all life’s simple things Or know when the day has passed  Open up your windows  And let the world shine in Stop and smell life’s roses Not even thinking of what consequences it will bring  If you hold your heart in your hands  And shelter it from the world You will never know of love 	And the joy love can bring
