The fat man motivated everyone with his meaningfull speech about his son.Thenthe woman whose children was goingto the ar asked the fat man "Is your child really dead".After that moment suddenly the fat man brokedown and falt extremlly bad.What I understand from the fat mans feelings are, he remembered his child and for a moment he realised that he won't be able to see him again.I think the fat man din't think like that before so he felt very sad and couldn't stop his tears.
