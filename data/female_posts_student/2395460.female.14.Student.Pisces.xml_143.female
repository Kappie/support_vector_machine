But I live a rich fantasy life in which this is always about to happen. Why tempt fate when I can have this power backpack from  urlLink APC  with its built-in charger? The pack is designed for easy access to all your mobile devices, and can be plugged into AC outlets, airline power receptacles, and car cigarette lighters.
