Jeff gave me a little plug over at his blog, so I thought I'd return the favor.  He's linked over on the side, or you can just  urlLink click here .  His blog is really great: he has witty and interesting and diverse insights, and he is an excellent writer.  So stroll on over and give him your patronage.  You will not be disappointed.
