Me: So mom, I have this question, and um yeah you know I love you.. hehe Mom: Mkay, so what do you want? Me: Okay well, what would you say if I bought my own ticket, went with a friend, and got dropped off at a concert? Mom: How much? Me: $32 or something like that. Mom: Where? Me: St. Louis. Mom: When? Me: The 28th. Mom: Who? Me: John Mayer. Mom: Oooh he'd be a good one to see. Me: Yep... Mom: So it sounds like you've been talking to someone about this? Me: Well I've researched the ticket, but not the friend yet. Mom: Well I don't see any problem with you going to see him. I'd just drop you guys off and then come pick you up when it was over. I don't know how your father would react to that but we do have to run it by him. Me: Sounds good.. plus we have that Jimi Hendrix thing on him. (LISTEN TO THIS! When my dad was TWELVE his mom dropped him off with a friend at a Jimi Hendrix concert in Memphis! So he better not freak out about this!!) Mom: Yes true, I'll talk to him about it. Me: You're the greatest, Mom. Mom: Yeeah.. haha.
