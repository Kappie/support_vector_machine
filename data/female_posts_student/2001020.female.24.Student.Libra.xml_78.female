I'm just deep in thought right now. Maybe I could attribute this to the lack of sleep...I dunno. What I do know is that I've been thinking a lot about R lately. Just how everything in that relationship was exactly how I thought things were SUPPOSED to be in a good relationship. Everything. And things like that aren't SUPPOSED to end. Am I ever going to find love comparable to that again? Or should I settle? Or should I live the single life for the rest of my life? It's a ponderable question. I just don't know. Anyway, enough thinking. It makes me sad to dwell on it. 'Night.
