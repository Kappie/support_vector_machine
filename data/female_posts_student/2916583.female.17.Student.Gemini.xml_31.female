The fact that it's banned at school doesn't help either.  This is retarded: they've banned all humor and personal sites.  I can't do anything except read freakin dear abby and news of the weird.   Just a thought...why must we have nicknames?  I can see for the kid who's a boy named Michelle or something, but why for the kids whose parents weren't high when they named them (I actually know a girl whose parents allowed her to choose her own name...she was called Jaime until she chose Leanne).  Here's what cousin (cuzn if u live in Mississippi) Steph thinks:  Whatevr2005:  why do u think we assign nicknames to ppl   msmonkey1029:  i dunno  msmonkey1029:  inside joke? There you have it.  I'll admit I've given some nicknames in my day.  Just take my cat, for example.  Princess has many aliases, including, but not limited to: fluffy, pincess, ellysmay, pincess ellysmay, smelly cat, fat cat, constance, kitsy kitsy boo boo, bew bew, kitsy boo, kitty, baby, baby cat, and kitty kitty.  Quite a list.   Just finished reading some quality dave barry, who, in my opinion, is the greatest comic ever (other than the fecund brains over at The Simpsons, Friends, and all the other comedies I watch...basically he's an awesome newspaper columnist).  I also like reading Ann Landers, and, on occasion, Dear Abby, for their advice to some of the most messed up people in America.   Well I think that's a wrap.  I'm feeling a bit sick and think I'll lie down (curses, Dominique!!!).  Later.
