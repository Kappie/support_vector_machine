There wasn't as much action as I thought there would be, and some of the story line is based around a love story, but it's really not one of those gooshy romance films. There's a surprise twist at the end, which I thought might happen early on in the movie.It is now my most favorite movie ever. The Others doesn't even compare to The Village. Oh yeah, and after the movie we went to Nicky Doodles for ice cream.  John was supposed to come to our house today to talk about stuff I'm not aloud to write in this. Accually I'm not supposed to tell anyone, but 3 of my friends already know, oops. He was supposed to be here at noon and he called around 4 sayting that he couldn't make it . I accually woke up on my own at 10:30am to clean the house up a little bit before he came. I am so proud of myself. His girlfriend Luann probably had something to do with it. She's a bitch.  I write too much. I also talk too much. I'm gonna stop writing now.
