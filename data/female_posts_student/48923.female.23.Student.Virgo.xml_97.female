(cursed being a P yet needing to be a J.)   on another note, i have added 2 more states to the list of states that ought to be destroyed during the revolution.    Alabama (imagine driving for hours on an uninteresting 2 lane country road, where the only excitement is trying to pass cars in the incoming traffic's lane at 80 mph. pure waste of space.)  Delaware  (it has a city named dover in it, what other reasons do you need besides it is a evil waste of space? for those new to the game dover, england is competing for the prize of worst place in the entire world.)
