I was a little bit skeptical about him having a new doctor only because he has only seen two cardiologists in his lifetime.  So this is his third and from the sound of it, he won't be around too long.  =(  Go figure.  Bailey is doing well, he is a whopping 4'4" and 70.5 pounds.  DAMN!  Not bad for a six year old.  Yes you guys read that right he is still six, won't be seven until November.  He is a GIANT!  Now I was a little concerned because I was told that it looks as though he may need a pacemaker and of course we are unsure of when exactly, it is all going to have to be based on his heart and how everything goes.  That is the bottom line.  I guess I see Bailey and just assume that everything is all well...but he still has some problems and some serious issues.   It sucks, but there are still some serious things that need to be considered...like his ventricle is is doing some serious work, since he only has one.  Well it seems as though with him being as big as he is, the chances of it failing are higher...buthe could just prove them wrong again.  He has so many times in the past.  Well I better go, have to run and get some chicken.
