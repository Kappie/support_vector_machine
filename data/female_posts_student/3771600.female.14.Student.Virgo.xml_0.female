Pre-marital sex has all these and more I know, but the question that I asked was why does it have to be such a taboo? Why does it have to be such a taboo until you cannot talk about it openly? What happened to proper sex education? Let people do what they want about their lives-whether or not they want to unwrap that special present is their business not ours.  About homosexuality, I think that they are just people confused about their sexuality, but that does not give us a right to ostracise them, does it? They probably just need more time to really find out bout themselves but we, instead of giving them advice or a helping hand, treat them like sub-humans. I don't want to give you guys the wrong impressoion about my parents-they don't encourage pre-marital sex nor do they oppose it either. They strongly oppose sleeping around and one-night stands- believe me, they do.
