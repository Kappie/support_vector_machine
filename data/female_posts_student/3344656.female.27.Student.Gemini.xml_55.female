But now I really want a brownie from my mom's kitchen or Rocky Mtn. Chocolate Factory.      I bought a computer this weekend...  I was going to get an iBook, but at the last minute I decided that it might just be too much of a pain in the tookus to try and take things that I'm working on at work and school and try to figure out how to make it all work.  So I got a Dell 600m.  I will hopefully have it in a few weeks.   Spending that much money sent me into a case of the vapors.
