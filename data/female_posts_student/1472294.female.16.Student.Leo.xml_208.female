I could have cooked noodles myself but the stove made a 'click', 'click' sound, and I frightened myself by telling myself over and over again that if I cooked noodles, the whole kitchen would explode. Anyway, back to the toaster. The toaster was so black inside out and the 'door' was spoiled. Well, I have to make do with it. And I can say that I am a lousy toaster girl. Both my sussage and bread were toasted black. Well, partly to blame the toaster itself. *_* Drank cold coffee, could be the cause of stomach weirdness....
