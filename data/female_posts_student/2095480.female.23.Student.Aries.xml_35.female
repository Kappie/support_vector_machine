I think it goes without saying that I "bit off more than I could chew" this week.  However, all that was planned, from VSO to the Statistics test (and more - see previous entry) was out of my control. I broke down infront of  Dr. Young  today - and I think he understood of what was going on. I was so sick in his class that I had to leave twice... he asked me what I had, and I told him, "Stress".   I've been kind of a bitch to my friends lately, and  I am so sorry  you guys. This week was definitely in the top five for most challenging academic weeks. The only others I can come up with are F03 and S03 Finals, F03 and S03 final senior papers, and perhaps 2nd barrier.   This week's highlights include a Huddle House adventure with  Rick, Jerry and Debbie,  hanging out individually w/  Rick, Miranda  (at the lab),  Shaun, Belecha  at Denny's, talking to  Patrick, Scott and Irene  on AIM, going to  Sam 's recital, and seeing   West Wing   (my very favorite TV show). Also had a GREAT presentation for  Dr. Magnasco's class Persuasion Theory , I also have been doing alot of reading for the  FSE  - as usual.   Things at the office have been rather hectic lately, but now that the boss is in London for a month, we might actually be able to finish long-over due projects. The one that I must finish is a new web page banner for  International Programs   urlLink (www.valdosta.edu/cip) . Once done, the new banner should go up in a three or four day span, so keep an eye out everyone.  A very sad note, my cousin   Brandy  had a miscarriage this week. Please keep her and her husband   Brian  in your thoughts and prayers.  I guess that's it for now.  Spring break  is coming up soon, and I don't know how I am going to handle putting up postings for that yet... I might do just one long one at the end, or go day by day like I do now... just check back occasionally, I know that I will write about the break somehow somewhere.  Take care, Goodnight.
