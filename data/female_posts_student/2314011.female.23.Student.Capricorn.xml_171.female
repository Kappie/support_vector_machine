She'll be in DC, playing breadwinner to Alycia's Super-Law Student-Intern for an illustrious international ambassador; and together, they'll probably make the world a little bit better for their efforts.  Meanwhile, the rest of us back in Moscow will be missing out on the promised barbecues and hot tub parties.    Plus, I'll be missing out on conversations like this:  "Hey Miss President, how was your weekend?"  "Did you bring me a cookie?"  "What kind of a relationship to you think we have?"  "Will you carry my books for me?"  "What am I to you?"  "A gap-filler."  "Here, I'll walk behind you, since I'm just the Vice President."  "Two paces, at least."
