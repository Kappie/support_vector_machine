A great weight has been lifted off of my life, and from this point on, the school year will be delightfully livable.  Can I even go as far as...fun?  Yes, I think I will.  Fun.  Ha, now there's a concept.  According to plan, Ellen, Ryan and I went to eat Chinese after the test today.  I had beef lo mein, and they both had sweet and sour  pollo .  (That's Spanish for chicken.  Yeah.)  Anyway, it was a good time, as always.  My fortune cookie read "Face facts with dignity."  Little did I know that I would do just that later in the day, but that's another story.  Anyhoo, I even had time to get gas before driving back to schoolie.  $1.999/gallon!  Yay...not.  Every once in a while I draw inspiration for blog topics from a website with a calendar of them...a topic listed for every day of the month, for every month of they year.  It's kind of neat.  Anyway, I thought I'd explain that before I start to write today's suggestion:  "Write a poem about laundry."  Why, you ask?  *shrug*  Well, why not?   Dirty and Wrinkly:  A Poem  By K. Fritz  In a dark room, there's a hamper To that room Mom demands I scamper Piles of shirts and pants all sorted And many socks, their colors assorted  Beginning my task, I throw stuff in Push the button, they start to spin Round and round with soap and bubbles Washing away all my dirt troubles  When the buzzer sounds, I smile For I can now dress in style Clean, clean clothes I do possess And I'm sure you acquiesce.  Hehe.  Using  acquiesce  in a poem?  Who does that anyway?  I read the poem to my parents, sure that they would appreciate it, and they did.  Dad even had his own suggestion for a poem.   Laundry:  A Poem  By S. Fritz  Roses are red, Violets are blue, I think laundry sucks. I bet you do, too.
