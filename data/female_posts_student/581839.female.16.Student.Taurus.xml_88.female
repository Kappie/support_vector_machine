Mary went  back to college, i got braces, and i realized that i sound like a nerd on blogger, because i'm always so... ugghh. just too happy and stuff. or maybe i'm just in a bad mood because i'm at school until margaret decides that she has no more questions about AP chemistry. and i have to do my math homework, along with my science homework, which i can't do at school, because the materials are at home. so. there you have it. margaret got braces today, and she stayed home from school, the jerk. she got to go to costco with the missionaries and everything while i stayed at school. margaret said i had no friends because i'm so mean, so. i guess that shows you my day today. not much, as usual. Smith has been over a lot lately, but only because his compainion has a cartiac in his eye, so they can't do much. i don't mind though, because smith is my best friend, and of course, i am not one of his, but that is ok. he's just really nice to me, and makes me actually feel like a person instead of a robotic babysitter/"witch to my sisters"/jerk/stressed out/ugly/too talkative freak. anyway, i'd better go and get on that math homework due tommorow.
