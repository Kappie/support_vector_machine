Tuesdays are no better. Wednesday get better. Thursdays aren't that great because there is hope, and that little bit of hope makes it seem okay but then you realize you still have to go the next day. Fridays are pretty good 3:04PM and beyond. The favorite part of the week is Friday late afternoon/evening.   So I thought since I've been watching some of the music videos I've downloaded, I thought I might update my 10 favorite music videos of the month. And I thought I'd share them here with anybody who cares. Now, I don't have MTV or VH1 or anything like that, so the only videos I get to see are the ones I download. I've only downloaded about 20. So it might not be that I'm partial to AFI videos (maybe it is because they are my favorite band and all) but those are the majority of the ones I've downloaded and all. You know?      " Friday I'm in Love " by The Cure  " PDA " by Interpol  " Karma Police " by Radiohead  " Girl's Not Grey " by AFI  " He Who Laughs Last... " by AFI  " Totalimmortal " by AFI  " White Wedding " by Billy Idol  " Silver and Cold " by AFI  " The Leaving Song Pt. II " by AFI  " There There " by Radiohead
