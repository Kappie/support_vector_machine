A lot of it rings true for me, though, unlike him, I was never a leftist.  I did at one time consider myself to be fairly liberal, though now it is tough to remember that time.  Perhaps one day I will try to articulate here why I stand where I stand today.  Until then, go read the piece above.  I won't even display highlights because I'd want to represent the whole thing, and I think everyone should get it direct from the source.  Plus, I don't want to chop it up - everything should be read in context.
