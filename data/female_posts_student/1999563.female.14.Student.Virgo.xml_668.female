The elderly couple laughed together as they traversed through the winding road.  They were returning home after a weekend spent in happiness together on the coast.  Who knew this would be there last moments together.  Suddenly, the man the drivers seat raised up his left arm to strach his tired eyes...  "Watch out honey!!" shouted the woman as a deer calmy pranced accross the road.  The man quickly turned to the left to avoid killing the graceful deer.  The car left the control on the mans sweaty grasp.   The car quickly flew on the hill.  The man didn't dare to even breath  as his entire future left his grasp.  The woman sat there, eyes bulged out.  She leaned over and kissed her husband on the cheek. He didn't even turn...  All this happened in a matter of seconds.   The woman slowly opened her eyes. She was alarmed by what she saw...  There car, which they had bought only a month before, was now as curvy as the sea on a stormy day.   Slowly she looked out the window, which was now just a few fragments of broken glass.  They were in the middle of an uncharted forest.  "How did we get here?" she quitley spoke.  Then the whole thing came back to her momory...  "we were....tumbling.."  She tried to move her legs but she had lost all feeling.  Then she remembered, Frank. Her husband of almost 50 years.  She tried to move her head.  It hurt like the the fire of a thousand suns.  She had to see Frank.  At this time Frank was worth all the pain she had to endure to see him.  Frank's head was bowed down and his hands were heald together, a sign of love to his God.  "Frank!" the woman yelled.  He didn't move. His eyes did not open.  At once her worst fear was realized...Frank was dead.  She closed her eyes.  A single tear graced down her cheek.  As if opening a dam a river of tears flowed.  Moments later she heard the sirens.  "Are you all right?" The fireman rushed to the side of the car...  "Frank..he's dead..."  "Help is on the way." The fireman tried to calm her shatered heart when suddenly more medical technitions rushed to her side.  "We will get you out of here...everything will be ok."  She didn't feel anymore calm then before they came.  She wished they would just leave her alone so she could die here, next to Frank.  In a matter of minutes she was in an ambulance.  "Where is Frank?" she demanded.  "Frank isn't here..." said the driver of the car.  Suddenly, the fast moving car came to a stop.  "What's going on?" the lady asked  "We need to get you out of here."  She wished she could see outside but there were no windows on the ambulance.  All she could hear was the engines of...maybe 20 cars.     "Why are we stopped?"  Suddenly her own life became something of importance...she didn't want to sit here, she needed to go to the hospital.  "We are waiting for the helecopter."  Suddenly, a childish excitment reached her nerves..  "A...a...helecopter? but, sir, i'm afraid of heights.."  She heard a loud engine...something...something landed but 10 feet from where they sat.  "It's here, we need to get her out of here."    She was carried out of the ambulance and into the helecopter...  ______  It seems like everything happened so fast.  I don't know if this was how the story went, but I saw it all with my own eyes.  It happened on our way home from the beach...  It seems like lives can be changed in such a short time...
