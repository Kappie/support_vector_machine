Lots of people go all out to get you and then every now and again, someone does something nice, a friend calls you out of the blue or something and that one small thing can restore your faith in mankind. I went to the reunion not expecting too much. I expected some awkwardness, some sort of acting 'clannish'. Well surprise, there was nothing like that. Despite not knowing some of them, it was good. Felt good and comfortable. So it wasn't an exciting time, (though Mariam was excited) but it was more a feeling of people at ease with themselves and with the others around them. Things have changed. There is no doubting that, people have matured, some more than others but the feeling is still of people who needn't chatter nervously to ease discomfort. It was of people just fitting in with one another like an old jigsaw puzzle that has been completed a lot of times. Going to my neighbor's house for the night, well that was a little uncomfortable I admit. But that was just because I cant really communicate with them. That was the only problem. But when auntie replaced some of the stuff I lost, I knew that here they were, another set of people that cared. even Mariam's hubby. Why I had him painted as a villain I don't know. But really the guy isn't that bad. Okay, so he has a whole bunch of quirks but even he loosened up. I appreciate that he made the effort and made Mariam happy. That's what the weekend was all about. Happy people.
