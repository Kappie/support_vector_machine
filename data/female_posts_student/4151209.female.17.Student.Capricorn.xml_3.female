I got some cool outfits ( I'm not really into the whole sporty look, more like preppie/ retro punk).  Anyways, senior year starts in 12 days.  I have really mixed emotions- I mean I'm stoaked because it's finally over- the final stretch, but I don't know, the whole social aspect is kind icky- it's so cliques and trivial.  As for the learning aspect, I'm really excited to be back to school and getting some knowledge back into my head, even though my school is especially mediocre when it comes to academics.  I feel like the summer, kind of drains one's knowledge bank, I honestly don't know what I would do without education and knowledge.  It's fascinating for me to learn- one day at work, I saw a book that had all these chemical compounds, formulas, and breakdowns, and the sad thing is I probably could break them all down without the book.  Besides, to me, knowledge really is power- it really does hold the key to my future.  I don't know, as much as I hate getting up early to go to school, and as much as I hate the whole social aspect of school- I am actually a big advocate for year round education.    GOSH, I AM SUCH A GEEK!!!   Btw: My schedule for the first term is as followed: Trigonometry- They stopped making it an honors course this year! Advanced Placement English Anatomy Honors Advanced Placement Economics Computer Applications- unfortunately it's required
