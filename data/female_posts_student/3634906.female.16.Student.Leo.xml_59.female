I'm tired... well actually I'm not tired at all... but even so I am still feeling worn out... basically my whole family is gone except for Kevin... they went to see an apartment for Pickle... I'm okay with them not being around... its a little less crazy when they arent around... now Kevin is going in the shower which means that I have to wait a good while of time until I can shower... OoO... oh well because I dont smell that bad... haha... I cant wait to wear one of my new outfits today... but I really need to do laundry... I have to do at least all my underwear... hahaha... because I only have like 5 pairs left... and I like to be able to keep my options open so I need them all clean... I guess I'm just a little crazy when it comes to that... haha... my head is kind of hurting... oh well... I will live... I think that I might call one of my friends today... yes I do have friends... and see what they are up to because I havent done anything with friends since Wednesday when Britt and James came over so I am slacking in that department... especially with Mandy... erp... its so weird I havent seen her since tuesday and havent talked to her since thursday... thats so weird... we used to spend everyday together... OoO... whats happening??? haha... well I am going to go now because I didnt plan on this one being long... because I have nothing to say... haha... well goodbye       -gabby      "So, we're talking forever and you almost feel better but better's no excuse for tonight. You see, it's never been enough to just leave or give up but, it's never good enough to feel right.    Now I'm lying on the table with everything you said it will all catch up eventually. Well, it caught up and honestly the weight of my decisions were impossible to hold but they were never yours, they were never yours.    Well, I know you know everything. I know you didn't mean it. I know you didn't mean." - Taking Back Sunday (This Photograph is Proof [I know you know])
