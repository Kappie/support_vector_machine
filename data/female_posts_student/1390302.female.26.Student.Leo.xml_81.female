I have, of late, been wondering how one goes about knowing what is so-called “calling” in life is?  I have in my life had many, many career goals and aspirations.  I even now have a new one.  I intend to be a writer.  I know I can write and love doing so, writing is like reading for me, if I do not do it I go crazy; most of the time that’s why I write this blog, to bide my time because I am not sure what else to write.  I have so much static in my head and don’t have the foggiest clue how to resolve it to words on a paper.  I have been informed that this static is too many ideas rather than the lack there of, though I cannot for the life of me see how it is different.  Either way I am left with nothing to write and no direction in which to traverse.  It’s difficult because before I decided I would be a writer I had a million ideas running rampant in my brain and now that I have decided that writing will be my life’s work I can’t seem to access all of those ideas.  Ideas, an abstract idea which for the life of me I cannot seem to grab; they always seem just a short distance away, just out of arms reach.  So again, how does one go about choosing what they will do with their lives? In my life I have wanted to be a marine biologist, an architect, an interior designer, a paralegal, an archeologist, an artist, an art historian, a historian, and a writer –among many others- and not in this order.  Equally, everyone I know has had these same problems at some time in their lives.  And when we do choose how do we know we have made a wise choice?  How do we know that the decision we have made will make us truly happy?    I have been thinking about it and what I have come to is that everyone has these same problems.  It’s very much akin to the fear that one has married the wrong person or bought the wrong house.  It is simply a decision that one has to make with the utmost belief that they have chosen correctly.  I hope that I have chosen correctly…  ~Kristyn
