And i don't know what to do. Ahhz.. Well,i might as just stop here for awhile. Currently,listening to Nickleback's HowYou Remind Me. The band rocks and sodoes the song. Owh,I love Nickleback. I mean,the music. I dont worship the band. Lol.My fav part of the song:      It's not like you didn't know that    I said I love you and I swear I still do    And it must have been so bad    Cause living with me must have damn near killed you    And this is how you remind me of what I really am    This is how you remind me of what I really am      Im so not looking forward to tomorrow. Its gonna be a draggy Monday.. Have to the final design for my art project. Sucky. The only thing Im looking forward for tomorrow is the end of the school lessons.. So i can go home and sleep straight away. Oh yeah.. Have i mentioned I missed yayi badly? =) I miss you Yayi.. Love u so much. Wish that i can dream of u every night. Or every minute when im sleeping. In that case, I dont mindsleeping always. Ooops.. These days, Im getting more n more lethargic. Cant seem to handle my eyes like I used to last time. Sleepy~    Orites.. Let my lethargic-ness (is there ever such a word aniwae?) take over me and I shall let dreamland conquer my world in like 8 mins time when I'll close my eyes and see perfectness of this beautiful world,sleeping.Gnitez.      ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~
