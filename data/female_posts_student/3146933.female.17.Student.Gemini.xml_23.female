I do remember...dad came down Monday and he was here for a while...I helped him some...we switched cars so I've got my celica back! *Smiles major big!* That's a great thing. Being stuck at home without an option sucks. Anyways, aw, I love my dad. He let me go to Six Flags with Dustin and Patrick's youth group Thursday! I spent the night with Monica Wednesday night and I could NOT sleep. I was tossing and turning all night long! Every time I'd get comfy, I'd wake right back up. I don't know what exactly the deal was there. Sooo I got an hour or so of sleep. Got up at 4:30 and started gettin ready b/c we had to meet them at their church at 6:30. Wow, and I'm glad I woke up at 4:30 b/c Monica set her alarm for 4 and I guess she turned it off...Just...woke up..*shrugs* lol. We wore jeans and a sleeveless shirt under a t-shirt. Good thing. Oh boy. Our mornin started off....crazy. Ok so we leave and had some odd minutes to get there...we get down the road and she got gas...then..she realized she forgot her pillow...so she had to back to her house and get it...omg so scary...we were tryin to hurry. anyways..on the way back to her house...she looks over at me and she says "Oh God, Alicia, PLEASE dont move, PLEASE" and I was like "monica..what's wrong. what is it?" and she said "oh please dont move, i'll tell you but please dont move whatever you do" and I wa slike MONICA JUST TELL ME...IS THERE SOMETHIN ON ME?" she says "nooo please dont move please" and i was like "Monica, is there somethin NEAR me?" and she was like "oh GoD, Oh God, i'll tell you but stay where u are.." so it turns out to be a grasshopper and we pull over at the next store we come to..she freakin FLIES outta her car .. so do i tho and i go to her side and hit it out with her shoe...and some guy that was there came out to see what the deal was b/c we were so loud and he was crackin UP at us...LOL I would too tho so it's ok. Soo..on the way down there...I sat with Dustin..pretty cool.. :) I really got to know more of the people on that trip! Like...Sammy Aplin...he's so great yall...and Matt Brown...he's pretty cool too :) and Cody Elrod I think? and let's see..hmm..Josh Newman...Ashley Newman...and a bunch of other people but I'm thinkin that's the only ones that I hung out with the whole time..:D  *marquita says hey* So anyways...we get there and it was   SOOO   much fun but   SOOO   hot! Me and Dustin...we held hands the whole time...aw, so cute!  lol...the Batman and Superman rides were GREAT...when we rode this water ride..oh GOD...gross..there were these 2 girls..they were like...14 or 15 and they were freakin makin out. and I was like...NASTY. When we got off...we had to walk by them and Monica was like..."..and they stand there makin out and it's SOO nasty, that ruins my daY"  and I was like..yeah mine too. Anyways, I wont' say anything else about that but yeah the guys made me mad. *sigh* Guys. Dustin was def. sorry :D aw haha. But anywho, the day was great...rides and all...then at the very end...it started POURING down with rain :( *tear* I mean, we had like 45 min to an hour left and it rained that bad..GRRRR my hair got soaked and it was wavy and doin all this weird stuff and i just got mad and stuck it up in a ball and i was like.."if dustin doesnt like it he can get over it" buuuut when we got to the bus finally....and i sat with him he was like "you're so beautiful" and i was like "uhhh even when i look like this" and pointed at my hair...and he was like "I wish you looked like that more often" ;) how sweet. I look cute even when I look crappy. Aw, and when we were walkin back  to the bus in the rain...Dustin and Patrick ran off and left us...and...Sammy came to us and said he wouldn't let us walk back by ourselves! Sweet huh? He's really nice. Me and Monica played cards a couple times on the bus b4 we got off 30 min later and ate at Micky's! It was sooo funny..they were like orderin from the drive thru and they weren't even in a car! Oh gah..Dustin kills me.  I fell asleep on him a couple times but someone always woke me up :( but it's ok. I think me and Monica went...right to bed when we got to her house. :D...long day! More later?
