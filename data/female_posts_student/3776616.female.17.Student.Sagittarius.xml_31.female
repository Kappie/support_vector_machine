I was thinking about what Mande said the other day about how it felt good to lie to her mom, and at the time it didn't really make a whole lot of sense to me, simply b/c I'm used to it, and it just sort of feels normal to me.  But when it all comes down to it, that's part of the reason that I drink and what not - to defy my parents.  Othat than the fact that those things are fun, I also get the satisfaction of 'ha, you guys don't know what I'm doing, but you wouldn't like it if you did'  And maybe they do know about it, I'm sure they do to some extent, but still...  I don't even think about whether or not they believe my story anymore.  That isn't really a big issue, the main issue is that I get to do the thing that I want to do, right?  And the weirdest thing about all of this is that eventually it gets addictive.  It gets easy to lie about little things, so you start lying about bigger and bigger things.  I think I've even lied about where I was going before when I knew that they wouldn't care if I told them the truth.  It was completely pointless, but it was fun nonetheless.  Does anybody else get what I'm trying to say here??  I just reread it and it doens't make a whole lot of sense to me, but oh well...
