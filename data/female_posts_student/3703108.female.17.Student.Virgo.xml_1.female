I'm just glad that everything is settled. It always stresses me out so much when me and her fight. Anyway, my Dad and Margo went to Atlantic City. They won't be back until tomorrow. I hate staying home alone overnight, so I think I'm gonna try to stay at someone's house. I used to love being home alone, but ever since my Mom died, it just scares me. I don't know why. Well, I'm gonna go. I'm too tired to type. I may go back to bed.
