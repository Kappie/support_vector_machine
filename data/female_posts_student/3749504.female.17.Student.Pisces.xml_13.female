Great. Not even a damn phone call. Mmhmm. My best friends and I don't even get an invite =] supremely wonderful. I don't understand it. Not that I would have wanted to even go to a stupid rodeo, but it would have been nice if someone had called me. Everyone except Chelsea and I went. And like I said before, Chelsea was probably asked to go.       I'm always the last person to know everything, if I even do get talked to about something. Fucking hell, I wasn't even invited to Jayne's party in my sophomore year...guess she ran out of room or something. Some fucking thing. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL. We're all fucking best friends and we love each other to death (some more than others; I probably hang out with Amanda, Chelsea, Roxanne and Ash more than the rest) but...I feel left out a lot. I wish Amanda was here. I wish she was back. Fuck. I miss her more than I miss Bobert, and Bobert is the best friend I have ever had in my life. I FUCKING MISS HER.      Dorene talked about the Seattle trip too. If we're going, I have to know before the 25th so I can get time off. But yea, if they do go - I probably won't find out about it either, or be invited =] how nice.      Ok. Enough depressed shit talk. And sorry I'm cussing so much. ^^ I need to stop. I can emphasize things much better with other vocabulary words. Eh. Anyways...baseball rocks. Props to the players out there.
