Disapopintment, frustration, low self-esteem, no confidence, sad, and maybe anger..at urself. However, there's one very true cliche dat goes: What is meant to be urs will be urs. What is not meant to be urs will never be wif u for long. Love cannot be forced. Haha...my cousin once send me tis sms. It's so sad but true! I like it so much dat I saved it for half a year liao. It's in chinese..so i can only convert for u to see.   "In the past, I used to run after him. He never turn back to look at me even once. So, I ran even faster to try to catch up wif him. But I'm tired now...I can only change the habit of wanting to understand him..maybe it will be easier...."  How true! I wasnt sad or angry la. Juz can sigh in regret. All tis while, I only want him to be happy. Even if it means seeing him geeting attached wif another gal dat he likes. I gave up the run of liking him. Must admit dat my feelings for him faded..but still, I'm happy dat I get to noe him..and feel for him..and haf beatiful memories in my mind. I never regret all this..if I was given a wish, I wld still wanna go back to last year and haf these beautiful memories. As tis is abt the ending, it will be the last post in tis blog. I dun haf any wish to let Willy see tis blog or let him noe abt my feelings abt him. Haha! So frds, pls help me keep tis secret k? Take it dat u're reading a novel. (Unsuccessful attempt at romance..HAHA...) Many thanks!
