And at school, I think, there is a hope for friends and love... Well, I think I will tell you all about me so that you know what kind of person that I am. I have four thing that I love to do in my life. I love to play soccer, I love to read, I love to act, and I really love to dance. I find dance relaxing and enjoyable because my friends are there. I have been dancing for... I think this year will be my seventh year... Yes... I have played soccer for eight, this is my ninth year. I have read books of all sorts since I was five. I have been involved in the school plays since 7th grade. I am a sophmore at my local high school now. School starts in a month... I will enjoy being somewhere that I can be myself... Well, almost my self... The only time I am my self is when I am by myself and no one is there to criticize and judge my actions, call me irresponsible or stupid... Well it is late and I must be going. To anyone who actually read this thank you. It makes me feel... I don't know... I just feel something   ♥Jeanne♥
