Just another day to remember how terribly perpetually single I am.  364 or 365 days of the year (365 this year) I don't mind being single at all.  Just one of those days bugs me, and tomorrow is it.   I hate the commercialization of Valentine's Day, and this pathetic belief that you must do something nice for somebody you love on that day.  The other days of the year don't seem to matter.  Just make sure you buy the girl in your life a bigger bouquet of flowers (i.e. no individual thought at all into the gift -- just doing what the marketing industry tells you to do!) than all her friends, and you won't have to lift a finger for the rest of the year.    This essayist is right on the mark about the  urlLink whole torrid transparent day .  Probably the only time of year when I agree with anything  urlLink Jewel  has to say.  More to come...
