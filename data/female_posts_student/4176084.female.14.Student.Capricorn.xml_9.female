I have a website where I post some of my random sketches and I'm currently thinking about posting my dolls on it also. I play guitar(4 years), bass(electric, 2 years and upright, 1 year this fall) and piano(since I was 4, but seriously started about a year or so ago). I also sing alot. I hate choruses, and I haven't a clue why this is my 4th year and I'm still in it. I love plain old acting.  Musicals are okay, but its too many people and it's not half as fun as a small group of actors. Uh, I live in a small town in the middle of New York. I have 2 siblings and my parents are together. I think that's enough general information for now.  As you can read from the title and that last paragraph, this is my first entry. Hmm...My history of blogs and journals. My first blog was one provided by Tripod, when my site was hosted by them. Soon later, I got a Ujournal. I had that for a long while. I then heard about Live Journal. I would bet I've had my Live Journal for the longest. I'm not quite sure why I got Blogger, But I think it's because of the really cool profiles, *hehe*. I'm not thinking about deleting my account on Live Journal until I really know my way around here and I'm sure I wanna stick with it.  Well, so much for my first entry...
