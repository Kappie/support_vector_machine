We've had a busy week. Today it's raining and the candles are lit and the house has cooled off and Nick is napping! When he wakes up, we have more errands to run. Nick has done a good job sleeping the last 2 or 3 nights. He has been going to sleep at 8:30-9:00 and up at 2:30 and again around 5:30 or 6:30. After that feeding, he goes back to sleep  again  until 7:30-8:00. Last night I could not sleep, so I just watched Nick sleep. Heis so precious! I think he is the most beautiful baby in the whole wide world!!! I love his chubby, chubby hands! Nick  loves  to stand! His face lights up and he gets this huge grin that takes up almost his entire face!~his eyes crinkle, too! I love days like today. The only thing missing to make this day perfect is Shawn. But...he'll be home in 8.5 hours!
