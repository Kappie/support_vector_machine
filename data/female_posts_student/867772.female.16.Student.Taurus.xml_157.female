My mom was talking to my brother's friend's dad about how i wanted to spend a lot of money on a nice guitar, and he told her not to let Guitar Center rip me off. He brought her this guitar, which he bought on E-Bay for $60.00, and he gave it to me. He said I can learn on it, and if I like it, I can buy it for no more than $60.00, or I can borrow it until I know what I'm doing and I know what I really want in a guitar, and then I can go buy something bigger if I'd like. He's so cool.  So, I went and got it restrung at Centre Music, and I taught myself a song when I got home. I've never really played guitar before, so I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know one thing; I've fallen even deeper in love with tablature.
