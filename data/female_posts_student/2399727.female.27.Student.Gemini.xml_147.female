I also booked an appointment with my Disability Advisor to renew my accommodations for next year.   After I returned home, I did some work and then headed over to noon Mass.  D. is always the celebrant on Tuesdays.  A movie was being shot somewhere on or near SMC campus so there were movie production trailers blocking most of the street I walk down to get to church.  Consequently, I took a more winding route through the campus and as I was heading up to the church, I heard, "Why, hi there!" from behind me.  It was D!  We exchanged pleasantries and he remarked that it was Tuesday and that was a good thing (actually, I couldn't remember so that was helpful :-))  Before he headed into the office and I headed into the church, I mentioned that after 15 weeks of waiting, I was finally going to CALSS today. He was pleased and wished me luck, calling it a step forward.     urlLink     urlLink     Heading over there now.  Yikes.  More to come...
