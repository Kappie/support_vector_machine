I really like driving the echo now, as much as everyone else hates it. I'm just used to it now, know how to handle it. Oh, and Rafael laughed for like 200 years about my grandma crashing her car (ok that sounds awful but its a funny story). But another thing that is detracting from my potential good mood is....  school.  Bah! i don't want to go. I suppose it'll be alright, get to see friends and such... ok i'm gonna convince myself that it will be good. And i won't have to dread SAC because i'm finished my PIP. LOL anyone who doesn't do society and culture would have NFI what i'm talking about. Hehe, so many acronyms, so little time. OK i really am a  nerd  :P or as Kate said - nerdburger :) I like thatword hehe.        Man my brother is annoying. He just sits around and goes  "okkkkkk!!! i aaaaam!!!"  whenever you ask him to do anything. He is really getting on my nerve atm. AND he gets another week to bum around the house.. sooooo lazy. OH well i'd kind rather be around my friends, even if that means going to school. I'd hate going to his school. I hope we get our jerseys tomorrow!  that would be so cool.  I'm not quite sure why bold was necessary then, but i am sure it was :)        So, as Jen was saying on  urlLink her blog , I too, feel like i have nothing much to say! and i am going to continue this post having nothing to say. It's funny how i've managed to get like 50 entries in this blog without saying too much. oh no! Guh! I swear my mum must h8 me or something because she just left to go for a walk. when i wanted to :(. no fair!!!!!!!!!!!!! :@ oh ppfff. I should go for a run or something but i just ate. I have regional/area athletics coming up soon. I'm a bit scared cos im in the 400X4 relay... yeah so a bit scary. But should be ok. I'd really like a CHS jacket. the aim was to get one thru x-country or athletics but i had to pull out of half my events cos i did my stupid shoulder in. which reminds me i have not done my exercises today :O My bad! (i say that waaaaaay too often).        Well it looks like i had more to say than i thought i did. I'm off now to find my school skirt which needs to be hemmed but it won't happen because nothing in this place ever gets done..... lol damn it          BYE BYE ;)           listening to: 'Highway One' - the Waifs.
