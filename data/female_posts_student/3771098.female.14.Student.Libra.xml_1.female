Keah came to registration even though she just got her embedded wisdom teeth taken out yesterday without laughing gas i might add so props to keah for coming.  Shoot, i have to be put all the way under.  None of the shots in the mouth thing.  no me gusta.  So i got my schedule.  I don't love all my teachers, especially Mr. Lauzon for H-Bio.  It sucks major that i have him.  Supposedly he's a hard teacher, and a bad teacher which is just great considering i'm gonna' major in like pre-med or biology, so i'd like to have some kind of background but oh well.  I guess that's just not gonna' happen.  I also have someone named Stafford for Espanol tres.  I never heard of this person before but w/e.  Hopefully they'll be easy cuz i learned no spanish last year.  Gotta love mrs. carter...."no me gusta!"  So all the seniors, juniors, and almost all the sophmores register themselves and that's cool.  It's less people and less confusing for everyone.  Well, the freshman bring their moms, dads, grandparents, sisters, brothers, i mean everyone they know with them to registration.  What's up with that?  and then people yell at me about their screwed up schedules just cuz i'm sitting in front of a computer.  hello people, i hardly know what i'm doing.  So i nod and smile.  It usually works.  We got chick-fil-a for lunch for free.  That was awsome.  So here's my schedule:   A Day  1A) Fit/T-VB with Coach D 2A) Semester 1-Service learning with Tom Wise 2A) Semester 2-Photo 1 with Mrs. Long 3A) Spanish 3 with Stafford 4A) Alg.2 AD with Mrs. Frierson   B Day  5B) English 2 H with Mrs. Debenport 6B) World History 2 H with Mrs. Brock 7B) Biology 1 H with Mr. Loazon (ugh) 8B) Leadership with Mrs. Nye (yay!)  That's it.  Then after registration I went to Sally's beauty supply place to get pure acetone to take off my stupid fake nails which won't come off the normal way which is me just biting them off.  It was being a bitch and it took like 45 minutes for the suckers to dissolve off.  Ugh.  So I dunno if i'll ever get them again.  Then I went to like Office Depot over by Dutch Square Mall to get binders.  It cost 20 dollars just for my binders.  How gay is that?  Why can't they make cheap binders that don't break?  No comprendo.  Then I came home and got subway.  By the way, the new mediterranean chiken sub thing is awsome cuz they put tons of feta cheese on there which is the bomb.  Just to give ya'll the heads up.  Then I came home, watched some TV, the usual, then went to pick up mi hermano robert from ACX (it's gotta' be a middle school thing) and i ran into brooke and britt and sierra.  That was cool.  There's a full moon out tonight which is awsome and it reminded me of sleeping outside in SD.  So that's about it.  Tomorrow i'm supposed to go to my dad's office sometime and copy pictures from SD, then go to eat lunch with the grandparents then pack for Denver, then babysit til like 2 in the AM.  It should be fun.  Well i g2g cuz my fingers hurt.  Caio!  Liz
