I wouldn't mention which school they come from, but I'd tell you, it wasn't a very pretty sight especially with their school name printed in large font on the back of their PE shirt. The girl was giving her boyfriend some light punches and when that didn't seem to daunt him, shekicked himin his *censored*. (Ouchie!)That really got him fired up. He bent down to grab a book, rolled it up and retaliated with a good smack across the girl'sface.Though I was quite a distance away, I could feel the full impact of that blow.Even asI think of it now, I'm still rather taken aback by what I witnessed --such brutality.My heart went out to the girl, why does she still choose to hang out with him?Then again,I wouldn't know whose fault it is to start with.I would've lingered around a little longer to see how this brawl would turn out; butthe strain in my bladder muscles was getting unbearable. I hope theybreak up. But who am I to comment? Maybe that's just their way of showing affection.Inany case, the conventional way is still much safer and accepted bymost people. These fights are simply too violent. They might just kill each other without even knowing it, thinking they were justshowering care and concern.Tsk, young people nowadays.    I just learnt yesterday that JJ will be coming to our school to perform next Friday afternoon. This is the coolest thing that has ever happened to Nanyang in the past4 years of my Secondary school life, though I'm not a big fan.I hope it's not another one of those hour-long seminars on how tocompose chinesesongs, it isn't everyday that some pop star comes to your school. But, Steve Vai Live in Singapore will be the coolest thing to hit Singapore in the past 15 years of my life. It's still a week away! This is going to be the longest week I'll live through.    Also, Bridge has officially been recognised in our school! Now we don't have to keep tabs on the school bells to avoid being caught by the teachers. They'll just have to stand aside and watch us play our cards with no ability to confiscate them! Haha to them! Gosh, amI mean. Million thanks to Sara who had the guts to send Mdm. Mak the email asking for permission to play withpoker cards. Surprisingly, she approved and even sent out emails to allthe staff to make sure that they don't hinder our card playing. Man, I likeMdm. Mak more and more now. (Is this abnormal?)      EDIT:  I just updated the entry 'Something off an email...'; please re-trace your steps back to it.
