Last night when everyone went to Lacy's, I don't think Chris was going to even tell me he was, more or less invite me to go w/ him. So I was all like, "what's up w/ that?" Then today, he was being really weird and mean to me and Annie on the phone. I went to a few minutes of his game and then swimming with Annie. So when I came home I went online and started talking to him.  He was acting " cold " ya know? So I was like, "are you mad @ me or something?" (him) "no i dono its just  weird ..." (me) "what's weird?" (him) " i dono like this time we started going out i didnt like u as much as i did the last 2 times its weird" (me) "ooo, when did that happen?" (him) "???? i dono im trying to talk it out and not like do stuff right away" (me) well what's different (him) "i dono i dont like u as much as i use to and i dont wana hurt u" (me) "well what now?" (him) "wat u mean by wat now?" (me) "well u said u don't like me as much n it seems like  ur setting me up to prepare for u breaking up w/ me  is that what ur trying to do?" (him) "like i dono i think it would be easyr as u said to wait to school starts back up and sorrry 4 that im reallly srry 4 blowing away that chance u gave but i think we should be friends till school starts back up srtrrry g2g srrrrrry"  WTF? Okay,  twice  in  one  fucking week? No, I don't play these games. I hope you're reading this Chris b/c this is for you. Tried talking it out how? You call saying you don't like me as much anymore as talking it out? That's not how it works. I'm very, very pissed off. Once again, you broke up w/ me and hardly told me why. What happened this time? You were sure as hell fine Sunday when we were  making out  and all that. Monday, yeah you were fine at the pool. But then you didn't seem to care to mention to me about Lacy's, I don't think I would have even known you were going unless I IMed you. I recall you telling me that you'd never hurt me again, well guess what you just did. I don't wanna spend my time liking you if all you're gonna do is let me down and hurt me. I loved you more than any boyfriend I've ever had and I thought you felt the same way...  I'm really pissed off and upset at the world at this point...
