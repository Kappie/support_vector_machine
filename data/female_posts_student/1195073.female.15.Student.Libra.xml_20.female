I have been in an intense argument with her since Monday, but we've been in a disagreement since last Friday.  I wrote her an e-mail and told her what I really think of her.  I got a lot of praise from some people, as well *cough* Holly, Lauren, and Courtney *cough.*  I hope she doesn't read this.  I don't think she does, I doubt she even cares, she didn't reply to the e-mail, but I don't care, at least she knows what I think of her.  At first I thought it was too cruel, but an incident between us on Tuesday just threw me over the edge.  ~I have been trying to talk Courtney into throwing a 50-ish/retro vibe party to celebrate the end of the school year.  I don't think my coaxing is working, but it's still worth a try.  ~Conferences were today.  My parents and Mr. Brauhn are all pissed because I seem to be spending too much time on the internet.  This was probably most likely because I got a C+ on the last test.  Oh well, what can I say??  I hate science.  ~Other than science, I'm doing well in school.  Mrs. Recker seems to like me a lot better than I thought, as does Mrs. Digmann and Mr. Hejhal and perhaps even Mr. Lund.  Or maybe they were just being cordial in front of my mami and papi.  Mr. Burns said that some of my reactions to his thoughts on current events are 'classic.'  That's always good.  ~Lauren and I are working on a "28's Greatest Hits" compilation.  It includes songs that remind us of her, including "Break Stuff" by Limp Bizkit, "Bitch" by Mereidth Brooks, "Complicated" by Avril Lavigne (she sucks ass, but the song does remind us of 28), and "Kill You" by Eminem.  If you would like a copy, e-mail me and I will burn you one when I complete the process (Be fore-warned (sp??): THE ALBUM WILL CONTAIN EXPLICIT LYRICS)  ~To those who read this and have the Norah Jones CD, 28 fell through with her promise to burn me a copy, and I would greatly appreciate it if someone else could burn it for me, or let me borrow it to burn it myself.  If you burn it for me, I will provide the CD, or pay you back if you use one of your own.  ~I am also in the planning stages for the Best Summer Ever.  ~I pray for all of the soldiers and their families, but I have changed my mind on my anit-war stance.  I say that we really need to get rid of Hussein and his dirty-ass sons.  OK, I just stooped to an inmature level, but I don't give a dead rat's ass.  Well, that's about it.  THINGS THAT MADE THE LAST 5 DAYS GOOD: 1. HOTTIES {see Feb. 11th post 2. Jamming to 50 Cent every morning. 3. Warm weather  THINGS THAT MADE THE LAST 5 DAYS BAD: 1. 2828282828282828!!!!!! 2.
