I was always afraid to stand up to her, but now that school's over, I finally feel like I can because I don't have to face her. Anyway, I don't really feel like getting into the whole conversation, but at first she was being really defensive and kind of blowing off everything I said with a "Haha" or "Whatever" but I kept trying to get her to explain things to me. Her big argument is that no one calls her and everyone from school dropped her and we act like she doesn't exist. The reason no one calls her or anything is because everyone is so fed up with her attitude. She's like a time bomb. One second she's your best friend and the next second she is pissed off at the world. And she had the nerve to tell me that I think the world revolves around me! She just wants to blame everyone else for everything because she doesn't want to accept the fact that she's wrong. I really don't want to deal with her drama anymore. It makes me sick. In a way I want to be her friend and I want everything to work out, but on the other hand, I don't think I would be upset at all if I never saw her again. All she does is stress me out. I don't understand her and now I don't even think I want to. I give up.
