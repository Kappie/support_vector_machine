I gotta get myself one of those!) :) :) :) Any way, Valvados please can you close your HTML tags and also can you not use any thing fancy cause it doesn't work! Thanks! Aww, Mango wants to say hey! Ok so he's leaving! Every one's out apart from me... scary... ohh, I'm thinking out loud, sorry! (Eeek, way too scary.) And hell yeah, that RE lesson was soooo scary! With this freaky Italian film that was trying sooo hard to be funny, and it kind of was but no one was laughing! Wasn't it called Life's Beautiful or some thing like that in Italian...? It had nothing to do with RE at all! Ok, so Jane Austin? Getting in touch with your feminine side aye? But seriously, she is good! I go to FFOnline too! It's cool! Oh and you're opponent forgot to turn up in tennis?! What a dumbo! I mean seriously! Ultimate dumbo! Hehe, makes for an easy match though?
