And how are you today?  i would like to take this oppurtunity to tell you that my name is laura, and i am 13, gonna be 14 soon, and that i go to an all girl school in enfield, england. im in a band called the bitch stiches with my three best friends called Selin, Chloe and Carmella. Well officialy we have announced a band but we dont have fundings yet so, i'll keep you posted. I listen to punk bands such as: Lost sounds , The jam, Tsunami bomb, The Smiths, The ordinary boys, ETC'. wht i hate most about this world is the fact that so many people are discriminated because of thier tastes. music and political wise. so thats about me. now i'd like to know about you, what you like and what you think about the world. just talking about me is boring. IM gonna put some cool pictures on here soon, look on google images and that happens, just like that magic, some of my fave pictures are there when you type in gothic angel. they are really cool pictures.  i want to talk about my friends and our band. My friend Carmella is really cool, she is really gothy and listens to cool music, if you want to talk to her then the link to her page is here: www.sleep_in_eden.blogstop.com well its not really much of a link but just type the adress in, i think it works. hmmmm.... she plays the electric guitar in our band, 'the bitch stitches' SELIN: she is probably the coolest member of the group and is the front woman in our band, she listens to really cool music and her band list is way too extensive to read without your eyes going blury! a link to her page is: SHE DOESNT KNOW. right well thats really helpful, thankyou selin! CHLOE: she reminds me of a timid little forest rabbit, that sums her up, she doesnt realy want me to talk about her. she plays the cello and the bass guitar in our band. We all have been deprived of decent boys recently, so please swrite in for a chat. And dont get the wrong idea, those of the male species. WE ARE ALL 13! well,thats about it for this page, but im going to update this page really soon, and put in a link for pictures really soon! thanks for reading this pile of rubbish,    LAURA XXXXXXXXXX
