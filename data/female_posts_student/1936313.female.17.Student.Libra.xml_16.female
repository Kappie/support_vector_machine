I didn't oversleep, enjoyed my day... and got ready for the church fundraiser in Mullhurst at my leisure.... great stuff...  Went off to the church fundraiser perfectly fine... Kevin and Allie were there, (they looked soooo cute together... stupid me for forgetting the damned camera!! I'll try and get pictures off my aunt). Allie's absolutely glowing, said she's due sometime around the end of September and Kevin... hah.. when he actually stayed still for once was his good old positive self. The dinner was good (always is..) aaaaaand then trouble started.....  Had to break it to my Aunt and Grandparents I'll probably be going away for college................. and uh.. for once they were.. uh.. silent...... compared to the first time i brought it up and I got a series of "Its too hard, you can't do its" so i don't know what to think... .but either way it made me start thinking about college.. which equated to my stupid headache coming back..... great... great....... and it gets even better........the night entertainment started...  Let it be known now, I'm no great lover of country music, I don't mind it, but I don't love it either... I can listen to Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, Martina McBride and the like... but.....my god did this guy suck... it was -bad- country music and it was -bad- singing. And I had a headache.  I was ready to cry, seriously... Allie booked out on me with Kevin inbetween the 4th and 5th song..... I was stuck until past the 12th... grrr to them for leaving me alone!!  Haha.. but my poor Aunt was stuck there all night... hahahahaha.. (yes.. i'm evil...)  and college still has yet to be resolved....... next week.. by Thursday... hopefully........ or... neh... yea.. I'm not allowed to think about it.. it gives me headaches..    - -This one's for the girls who've ever had a broken heart, who've wished upon a shootin' star, You're beautiful the way You are.....This one's for the girls... Who love without holdin back, who dream witheverything they have all around the world, This one's for the girls..- -
