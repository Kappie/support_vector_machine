That was madness, and except from the bitch that tried to murder me, it was mad fun.  Theo gave me his pick (Gotta love that Theo.  Little trooper, coming out with larengitus and all) and the bald dude from Jersey mercifully gave me a water bottle.  (I would have done anything me asked me to.  That water totally saved my life)  Kootose to Dasani!  Happy Thanksgiving y'all.  Happy happy turkey day. (A.D.D. moment there.  lmao Oooh, a butterfly!)  Back to the concert.  Props to GOB/Legends for doing the all ager thing.  Fuck anyone who thinks they're to good for the kids.  You don't even know! -shake my fist at the fuckers-  Jeers to Afra's mum for not letting her come.  She should have been there, moshing her wee little heart out!  Cheers to the hottie in the AFI t-shirt.  You can have your way with me in a closet ANYTIME!!  (Gotta love the guys who stalk you with their eyes) (Tom from GOB was a little to pro with the eye stalking.  He wouldn't look away from me!!) (Granted I was directly infront of him....)  I'm off to bed, but will someone (Amy/Leslee) remind me to write about the sugar epidemic.  That was quality humor and the peanuts deserve to hear the story.
