I have gone for a very long time this weekend without feeling like this and suddenly swoosh, back to feeling odd. I hate feeling odd. I like feeling happy. I wish I could force myself happy, but I cant. I hate artificialness. it isnt right. I dont kn ow how people can live like that. it is odd. I dont like it. I really dont. I hate confining feelings and places. people also. they disturb me and hurt me...   Goddess Bless.
