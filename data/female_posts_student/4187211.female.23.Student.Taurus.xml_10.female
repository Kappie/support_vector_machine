Yes, spreading soft cream cheese icing on still warm, gooey, sweet buns, and then swirling it with my fingers (gloved of course) to make it look simply irrisistable, is one of my favourite jobs.  The funny part is that I don't even like cream cheese icing, and our cinnmon buns are made with corn syrup, not honey, so they're way to sweet.  But making food look asthetically pleasing is something I love to do...  perhaps I should go into the culinary arts?  I think I'd probably have to expand my tastebud tolerance if i were to do that because I could make everything, but then I wouldn't be able to tell if it was good because I would probably dislike most of the ingredients I put in it...   sigh...  I'm working on it.  My roomate Crystal provides tough love when it comes to trying new things so I've now aquired a taste for previously untouchable items (according to me) like peppers (although I mostly like the orange and yellow ones), lentils, zucchini, spanikopita, and soy milk.  I'm sure most of you are shaking your head at me right now, but at least I'm trying right? :)  However, I think that tomatoes are always going to be on my ewww list - I've tried to eat them, but there's just something about the combination of juicyness/watery flavour/peel texture that I can't deal with.  But I was supposed to be giving an ode to cinnamon buns.  Now, if you want to treat yourself to a truly divine example of what a cinnamon bun can be, you should take yourself over to the Kooteney Bakery Cafe in Nelson, BC (a long treck for some of you I realize, but I'll put it out there anyway) where my dad makes a delectable pecan cinnamon bun with a buttercream icing.  And so I shall leave you with that scrumptous vision.  I think I'm drooling a little... ;)
