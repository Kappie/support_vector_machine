I thought that I was trying not to be impulsive, but i couldn't really help it. I had been thinking about doing it for along time, but I never thought I would actually have the guts to do it! The only problem is that I didn't get a long barbell. So the balls on each side are cutting down into my tounge, because it's so swollen. It's like a constant ache. I tried to eat, but that's not gonna happen again any time soon. I don't know what to do tonight when my mom come home. She's so gonna freak. I thought about just not telling her, but she would so notice myfunny voice. And what am I going to do about work tomarrow? Oh well. hopefully it won't be as swollen by then.   Oh yeah, something of a little less importance, but still awsome: I also peirced my ears again. The lobes that is. Right above the first hole on each side. I think tonigh I'm gonna peirce another hole ontop of that one, so their will be three going up each side. I also wanna do my cartalige, but don't know what to put in it yet. I put horseshoe earings in my new holes, and they look hot. Maybe I'll go for either a full hoop, or just a plain stud. I really wanna peirce inside the ear, but I donno. The farther inside u get, the more dangerous it becomes. I don't know what to do anymore.  I'm so excited...The Bourne Supremecy come out tomarrow! I can't wait. I asked this one guy to go, but honestly,I don't think it's gonna work out. See, he's the kinda guy who never know's what he's gonna do tomarrow. Never plans ahead, never thinks ahead. Yeah, I know that I never think ahead either, but I can't fall asleep unless I know what I'm doing tomarrow. Me and him, we just don't mix like that. He's great to hang out with sparaticly, like a spur of the moment kind of thing, but I like talking to ppl on the phone, and making plans for next week, or even tomarrow. Then I have something to look forward to. But I also have this thing that if I ask someone to do something, I don't ask someone else, because what if they both end up saying yes? And I don't wanna call him and ask him again, cause I already did like 4 times today. My other friend really want's to go, but I don't wanna say yes to her, when I'm still "pending" with someone else. I know if I tell him about my problem, he'll just be like "Oh go with her! I don't care" and that makes me feel crapy, like he's just hanging out with me just because, and not like it's that big of a deal. I mean, I don't think it is, but i still care if he does. I'm such a hypocryte that can't spell! Lol. Oh well.  I'm gonna go nurse my tounge cause it hurts alot right now!  Luv ya,  ~Ani
