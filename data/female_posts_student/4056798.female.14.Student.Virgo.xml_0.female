So the last day of school, i got A's on both of my finals and we got our grades, an A too, second highest in the class, my brother is first highest. Another thing: We were the only two to get A's in the class. And you wondered why i couldnt update! So..it was really sad leaving and i have pictures on my website now! I know! i konw it seems like forever! But the thing is...i love these pictures and there in perfect organization. Links and everything. Much love to Zack and to Sarah, and to Mr. Parrot and to Alex and Chi Chi and Yue-Cheng, and Paige...we all love you doll! So...anyways we went to San Francisco where they (the dentists) became happy with sticking very scary sharp objects in my mouth and things that were really loud. I really didnt like it and i kept thinking i was going to faint. I just get like that. So then after that we went to our house in Daly City, all peachy. And then the house in San Francisco...very nice little (NOT!) house there. The renters are keeping it nice. Then t buy groceries where last time i went with my dad we saw this guy that played on the Kings basket ball...could get his Autograph though...Grrr : (. Anyways...then we got our haircut! You would love my hair...its so tiny and with my glasses i look like a freaking genius!!! Anywhoo! So...then we went and ate and this is the funny part. I was totally bored...stuffed to the brim about to fall asleep and this guy comes in with this other guy... I dont know, friends or something....so then what happened is that i went to go use the restroom it was a two hour drive back home. So...i went and when i came back i stared at the guy. He had a freaking bible with him and he had glassed that were plastic like mine. So i stared at him and i guess he thought i thought he was hot, which he SO was not. So anyways...he stared at me and smiled and said something. I didnt understand so i just kinda smiled at him. I sat down and then i realized he had said "Hey precious." Freaky deaky. I walked out of the resteraunt with my mom cause my dad was eating fish and that takes forever in a day. So...then what happened was my mom and i were about to cross the street when these gang bangers go by and they throw a glass bottle on the floor. It exlodes and i kinda take a step back. What idiots. Oh yeah, earlier i had seen this hobo women with a REAL Louis Vuitton bag, i personally thought it was hillarious. Cause she goes around with like dirty pants begging for money and she looks like she gonna die and in her hand a huge ass Louis Vuitton bag that costs more than she will ever have...she was holding it like it was her life. So..today i woke up with a fat headache, rememberd i was going Sushi-ing with Alexandra and Poof there goes my headache! So...we went to Sushi...i ate WAY to much. So much i thought i was gonna puke afterward. And the fact that we went out after for a cup of coffee that wasnt really a cup cause it was a venti white chocolate mocha from starbucks ( i cant believe i tossed it!!!) made me nearly gag. So...with the coffee in hand, cool haircut, neat glasses, loose faded jeans, carefree walk and black UCD sweater....we entered this hip little music store and sat down to listen to music, we were some fly little crackers! i felt totally sophisticated until i thought i was gonna puke. All the raw fish got to me. Oh yeah, huh! We went to Maren's mom store...a little funky. There was this TINY purse smaller than my palm and it had 20 on it. I went up to buy it...i mean tiny little purse made out fake leather...come one. twenty cents right? It was fity percent off. Of from 40 cents. I go up with my dollar...guess what? Its twenty bucks cause its "From Italy" Shoot man...i can kill me a cow in italy, make crappy purses, dye them, ship them over to the US and sell em for over a hundred bucks. These people are f-ing CRAZY! Not to mention they have a door smack in the middle of the damn store cause it shows off the too expensive hangers. Ridiculous. So...then after the music store, we went to the Salvation army...it was really cool. Even though it stunk so bad...there was some really good books. Then we went to go watch The Village. The movie...its not that bad, but if youre looking to get scared...dont go watch it. So anyways..after that...we went to Gap and we tried on some skirts and some pants and i found these pants...low on the waist cropped pants. THEYRE MINE! fifty bucks and this cute little hat and scarf...my birthdays coming up...*clears throat* Mommy, daddy? Wanna add that to the one hundred shopping spree at Pac Sun and the brand new dell labtop? Please...so anyways then we went to borders and we read some and then i came back home plopped down and watched Starsky and Hutch...hillarious and then im going downstairs to finish off the night with The Godfather one...i think i know my daddys new birthday gift... the godfather. Why are all guys obsessed with that damn movie anyways? So...heres to me and my two and half weeks of summer!!! You all know you love me!
