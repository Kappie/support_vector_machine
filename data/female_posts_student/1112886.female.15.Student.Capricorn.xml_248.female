It was so dark and solemn and I loved it as soon as I stepped into those beautiful gardens. I remember who I was with. Chrissy, Bethany, Chelsea, and myself. It was so peaceful. It was softly drizzling. At this point, Bethany and I weren't getting along so well. But everything was kind of pushed aside that night. Our fragile relationship was ignored and we were all friends. Like it was all meant to be. The drops were falling lightly on our faces. So lightly you could barely feel them. It was so magical. And the smell. Indescribable. I remember that place like I remember no other. The night was so beautiful I hardly believe such perfect circumstances could ever take place again. Or at least in front of me.
