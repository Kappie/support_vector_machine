A movie written and directed by Joel Schumacher before he got schlocky and crappy.  It's early 80's Brat Pack quarter-life crisis angst at it's best.  Gladly, even after all my trumpeting of the movie, most of the folks enjoyed it.  I recommend it highly to anyone in their post-college life and trying to figure out what the hell is going on.  Heck, I just highly recommend it in general.  After watching it we realized two things: 1. If "St. Elmo's Fire" is to early 80's self-absorbed quarter-life crisis angst buddy film genre,  urlLink "Reality Bites"  is the early 90's version.  You know what that means - it's time for someone to write the one for the early 00's (naughties?)  I personally figure this one should come from a crowd of friends who just graduated from a seminary.  Honestly, there's enough angst, sex, drugs, rock  roll, and general quarter-life crisis angst to fill at least a couple seasons on HBO.  I should get crackin' and write this stuff down....  2. Everyone who starred in "St. Elmo's Fire" is now probably old enough to do the early 00's version of  urlLink "The Big Chill!"   Yeah baby!  80's movie redux - gotta love it!  Oh, and if you get the DVD version as I did, don't miss the *classic*  John Paar video "Man in Motion (St. Elmo's Fire)" in the special features section.  Damn but I miss those 80's permed mullets!
