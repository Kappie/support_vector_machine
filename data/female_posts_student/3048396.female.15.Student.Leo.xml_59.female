Shes really nice and I had a good time. We had to keep the kids really busy cuz it was kinda gettin bad outside so we just kept playin music and they didn't even realize it so yeah.  Then last night I stayed online till like 1:30 cuz I couldn't sleep and had nothing better to do. But our stupid mouse doesn't work to well so it got annoying. For 2 whole hours I was on one website. It was a Humboldt website...yeah...thats what you call boredum. lol. Then today I didn't wake up till bout 1...sad huh? Yeah so I jumped in the shower then Kim came over. We hung out for awhile then we went to her house and watched How To Deal for about the 100th time. We can quote almost the whole thing. Sad. LoL. Then came home and went to Bible School. Man was it fun tonight! Well I went early cuz the helpers were all supposed to sing but then they weren't so then I went to my room and started working and then later I found out they did practice and it is tomorrow night so I dunno if I will or not. I might. So then it was opening...I wasn't in a good mood then. Im very emotional right now. Tears keep comin but all the lil kids cheered me up. We went back to our room it was kinda boring at first I worked on a sample and then they had snack. Then we went to a different room to check it out and all the girls just HAD to hold my hand. So they were pulling up n down and all that...I felt like I was being ripped apart. Then Deb tickled Cassie...Then the whole class had to tickle me. Man. That was bad. But they really cheered me up. Then on the way back to class I had 2 kids holdin onto my right hand and 6 on my left. It was hard...some were slow...some were running. Eh. Wore me out. LoL. Then we went to music...so cute...4-6 year olds are just adorable! Yeah. Then we went to another room and Cassie was gettin pretty tired to I had to carry her around. Then back in the room they colored and I talked to Deb for a long time bout NYE and how we are gonna get a bunch of Rally pics together and put them up in church. Then she told everyone she had the cutest pic of Ross and I. *Shakes head* And she said she was gonna give plenty of copies to my mom...great. LoL Then all the lil kids played games. The yelling was really loud. It reminds me of the days when I used to do that. LoL. Then they went home and Cassie was so tired I carried her into her moms room and she just layed on me and tried to sleep. Poor thing. Then they brought me home and here I am now...Well Im gonna go...  Tara   Current Music:  I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight  Current Mood:  Happy and Tired...
