I keep joking that he's going to have to wear either a fez or a big moose hat (with horns!) like Fred Flintstone or at the very least do a secret hoot or handshake when he enters the doors.  It turns out they do a lot of stuff for charity and there's actually an eclectic mix of different nationalities and ages and there are even women members.  I will not be joining for all that are curious.  :-P  I was actually kinda bummed that I couldn't make more fun of it.  They have a nice big pool and when you're a member, you can use it, which is cool because its about a block away from the house... That said, knowing me, I'll never use it.  I've been in a state of blah this past week.  I can't quite seem to get back into the groove of reading and actually thinking about things more complex than the mundane.  I'm sure it will pass and I'll finally get to reading The DaVinci Code which has been on the coffee table for weeks!  On another note, you know how when the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz gets his degree in Thinkology from the Wizard and all of a sudden he's smart and says, "The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh joy, rapture!  I've got a brain!"?  Well I've been feeling like that lately.  Like I really know shit now.  I know, I'm strange, but it does give one a sense of confidence.  Yesterday I was, in my ever-so-humble opinion, spewing out all this insightful shit into people's personalities.  It was wild!  Still can't seem to pick up a book, though.
