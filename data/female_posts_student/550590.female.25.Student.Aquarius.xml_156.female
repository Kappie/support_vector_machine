The first time she got as far as the back porch and waited quietly while Mommy had a brief hissy fit and scooped her up for a nice long cuddle on the couch.  Today "Grampa" brought over an onion so I could Crock Pot some Arroz con Pollo for dinner and Snoelle dashed out the front door like a white streak of lightening...This time there was a lot more chasing and cornering involved in getting the White Wonder back into the house where she belongs. If there were to be a silver lining in these incidents it's that Maggie is not the one running away. Not only is Maggs faster, she also refuses to wear a collar.  I guess it's true what they say: You can take the cat out of the street, but you can't take the street out of the cat...   .
