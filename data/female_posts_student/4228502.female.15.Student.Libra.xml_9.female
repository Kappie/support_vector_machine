I'm not superstitious or however you spell it; but its fun to see how other people are. So now I'm just sitting here talking to Ashes and playing Minesweeper flags with Nick. Which happens to be great fun. Though he let me win..and I was disturbed. I don't like people letting me win, call me stupid, but its not fun unless the game is played fair.  Oh well, and now I really have nothing else to say, but there are a few mistakes in my last blog...two of them you should be able to figure out, if you can't you're completely stupid but the other I feel I should correct since it is bothering me. "...just as certain of his lover for..." It should be just as certain as his love for her. Not lover for...lol. Anywho more of your time wasted and I'm done.
