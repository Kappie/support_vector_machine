That and bethie had no life as she so clearly stated, I do thus making it hard to edit. It's kind of funny though I'm not going to have a life the week she can't edit.   Work expeiriance was lovely. I was pretty damn boring for most of the time. The most exiting it go tfor me today was when I had t breakk into my house. Still haven't heard from Wall-Mart. I'm deffinately going to work on that. Must phone them if Chad can manage to not be on the phone.
