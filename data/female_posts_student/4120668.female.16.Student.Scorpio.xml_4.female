MISS JULIE HAD A PET CHICKEN:P ok ok i'm kidding for those who have never read miss julie...its a canary....*sobb* then after, we had chinese  without  our lovely little smeagle teacher...cause she just gave birth to a 3.4kg smeagle...oh oops...*cough* baby....i really miss her...and her poofy eyes...:P instead we got this other teacher who speaks to us as if we dont understand a thing....Neeeeee.....haaaooooowwww......maaaaahhh???? (NI HAO MA?) just a small example...really got me cracking up during most of class time though....after that....lunch...the usual..but there has been a slight inflation....*gasps* a ten cent increase on the asian food....anyway...that didnt get me down....cause.....I HAVE A FREE PERIOD AFTER LUNCH!!!!  which is why i got home early....first day of school really wasnt toturous...maybe cause i managed to get a top row locker next to darling reine's....but i still dont wanna suffer the rest of grade 12....got the EE, the courseworks, the world lit essay, the chinese oral test/mocks/exam, art exhibition, blah blah blah....
