I see a distorted reflection of myself in the water broken by ripples that begin to slip away and I imagine you beside me...  Can't you see that I'm spilling my heart into these pages?  When you speak I'm never quite sure what you mean are there hidden messages in your voice that rings out like the soft tone of churchbells?  I can't quite define what I'm feeling in words All I can say is that I'm drowning in this ceaseless storm and I'm drowning in the words you speak that I can't quite comprehend.
