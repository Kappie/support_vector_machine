Err... not here... *points at Izzy* "It's her!" *watches Izzy being taken away and sits down and watches tv with all six eyes* Did I say six... I have three pairs of glasses on... yeah... that's it... *COUGH* Heeey! I have a new bag and a pencil case! Woohoo! The pencil case is pink... yeay! And I'm thinking about attacking it with paint and glue...! Sounds like fun! Oh and I'm kidnapping Laura so we can see Star Wars cause she has to see it to be proved wrong that it is a cool film! So :P to Laura, and oh, sorry. Mmm... we ended up havin ice creams in bristol and we looked really wierd.
