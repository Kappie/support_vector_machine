We may all break the rules sometimes And I, I try to follow them as I live But you just do as you please Without asking God to forgive There's a difference between you and me And it's one people barely see Yes, were both christians, as we admit The difference is, your a hypocrite Always saying you were saved And that you live your life for Him The one thing you dont care about Is the fact that you always sin
